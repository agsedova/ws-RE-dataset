Meza was born in Mexicali, Mexico.\n\nMesa was born Jesus Fernández. Prior to beginning his career, and for undisclosed reasons, he changed his name officially to Juan Meza.\n\nMeza was a popular fighter among Latin Americans, specially those of Mexican descent who lived in North America. His trainer was the well known boxing personality, Jimmy Montoya.\n\nJuan Meza debuted on September 23, 1977, knocking out Elias Rodriguez in three rounds at Tucson.\n\nHe lost for the first time on his second bout, being beaten on points after four rounds by Valentin Holguin on October 13 in Los Angeles. Six days later, he knocked out Davey White in Las Vegas. Eight days later, he had a rematch with Holguin, over the extremely rare five rounds schedule distance. He avenged his first loss by outpointing Holguin.\n\nOn November 3, he scored his first knockout in the first round, defeating Horacio Pintado in Los Angeles. But, in his next fight, on November 18, he lost by a four-round decision to Carlos Ortiz, in San Diego.\n\nMeza began rising in boxing's ranks when he knocked Ortiz out in the first round on December 16, also at San Diego. He won 29 of his next 31 bouts, earning fame, particularly in the West Coast of the United States, as aforementioned. Among those thirty one bouts, there were many highlights, including:\n\n\nOn March 27 of that year, Meza got his first world championship try, when he faced Gómez in Atlantic City, for the WBC world Super Bantamweight title. Meza lost to Gómez by a sixth-round knockout.\n\nAfter losing to Gómez, Mesa took off one year from boxing. During this time, Gómez left the championship vacant; to challenge for the WBC's world Featherweight championship, and Jaime Garza won it by knocking out Bobby Berna for the vacant championship.\n\nMeanwhile, Meza returned to boxing on April 26, 1983, knocking out Roberto Castillo in four rounds at Las Vegas.\n\nHe traveled to Thailand during July of that year, to fight Pongpan Sorphayathai on the 13th. of that month. He beat the Thai fighter by a third-round knockout.\n\nOn November 19, he fought Javier Barajas in Las Vegas, beating Barajas by a ten-round decision. The pair had a rematch, on May 16, 1984 in Las Vegas, and Meza won once again, by a ten-round decision. After that, he was ranked as the number one Super Bantamweight challenger once again by the WBC.\n\nOn November 3, he was given a second try at the championship when he faced Garza, in Kingston, New York. Meza became the first challenger in boxing history to be dropped in round one, get up and knock the world champion out in the same first round, when he beat Garza to become the WBC world Super Bantamweight champion that day.\n\nOn April 19, 1985 he and Julio César Chávez co-starred in an undercard, defending their world championships against Mike Ayala and Ruben Castillo, respectively, at the Inglewood Forum, in Inglewood, California. Both champions retained their titles with sixth-round knockout wins.\n\nOn August 18, he and Lupe Pintor squared off in a fight that garnered major interest among Mexican boxing fans. Meza lost his title in Tijuana that night, when Pintor dropped him twice, outpointing him over twelve rounds.\n\nPintor lost his title, in turn, to Samart Payakaroon, who gave Meza a chance to recover the WBC world Super Bantamweight championship on December 10, 1986 in Bangkok. Despite not fighting for more than a year, Meza lasted until the twelfth round with Payakaroon, who proceeded to knock him out in that round.\n\nMeza had two fights in 1987, beating Lenny Valdez in the first round by knockout, and then losing to Javier Marquez by a knockout in round eight on October 30. After his fight with Marquez, he retired for ten years.\n\nOn February 14, 1997, he returned to boxing with a knockout victory, beating Esteban Lozoya in four rounds at Mexicali. But, in his next fight, he met fringe contender Wilfredo Negron of Puerto Rico, being knocked out by the Puerto Rican in the first round at Miami. Meza then retired for the second time.\n\nHe has stayed in retirement since. Because of his current age, it is doubtful he will ever box again as a professional.\n\nHis professional boxing record consisted of 45 wins and 9 losses, with 37 wins by knockout.\n"}

Many men returned to work in the mill or surrounding woods after the war.\n\nThe Red Rock Folk Festival, held by the Live From the Rock Folk & Blues Society, is held each year.\n\nRed Rock's main source of employment was a kraft paper mill owned by Norampac. The mill originally consisted of two kraft paper machines but in late 2005 was reduced to running one machine. On August 31, 2006, Norampac announced the indefinite closure of the container board plant. This was due to unfavourable economic conditions such as the rising price of fibre, energy costs and the strengthening Canadian dollar. \n\nIn September 2007 Norampac announced the sale of its Red Rock plant to American Logistic Services Inc. A new plywood mill was supposed to be operational by fall 2008, this deadline had been pushed back to spring 2009.

The Most Reverend Kevin C. Rhoades was appointed diocesan bishop by Pope Benedict XVI on November 14, 2009, and was installed on January 13, 2010. The Diocese of Fort Wayne–South Bend encompasses 14 Indiana counties: Adams, Allen, DeKalb, Elkhart, Huntington, Kosciusko, LaGrange, Marshall, Noble, Steuben, St. Joseph, Wabash, Wells, and Whitley. The diocese has a co-cathedral setup with the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Fort Wayne as the primary cathedral and Saint Matthew's Cathedral in South Bend as the associate cathedral.\n\nThe diocese was erected as the Diocese of Fort Wayne (\"Dioecesis Wayne Castrensis\") suffragan to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati on January 8, 1857, from territory earlier belonging to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Vincennes. In 1944 it became suffragan to the newly elevated Archdiocese of Indianapolis. In 1944 and 1956 it lost territory to the newly formed dioceses of Lafayette and Gary, respectively.

Because of the analytic class number formula, data on Siegel zeroes have a direct impact on the class number problem, of giving lower bounds for class numbers. This question goes back to C. F. Gauss. What Siegel showed was that such zeroes are of a particular type (namely, that they can occur only for χ a \"real\" character, which must be a Jacobi symbol); and, that for each modulus \"q\" there can be at most one such. This was by a 'twisting' argument, implicitly about the L-function of biquadratic fields. This in a sense isolated the Siegel zero as a special case of GRH (which would prove that it did not exist). In subsequent developments, however, detailed information on the Siegel zero has not shown it to be impossible. Work on the class number problem has instead been progressing by methods from Kurt Heegner's work, from transcendental number theory, and then Dorian Goldfeld's work combined with the Gross-Zagier theorem on Heegner points.\n\n"}
{"id": "1967202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967202", "title": "School band", "text": "School band\n\nA school band is a group of student musicians who rehearse and perform instrumental music together. A concert band is usually under the direction of one or more conductors (band directors). A school band consists of woodwind instruments, brass instruments and percussion instruments, although upper level bands may also have string basses or bass guitar.\n\nSchool bands in the United Kingdom are generally similar to those in the US although pure brass bands are more commonplace in schools than in the US. Some countries usually prefer certain special types of bands, usually drums, over conventional ones. The school band movement in Japan is unusually strong, organized around an enormous competition system administered by the All-Japan Band Association. Many international observers of Japanese school bands consider them to be the most impressive in the world, particularly among very young students, and Japan is also home to one of the world's leading professional concert bands, the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra.\n\nAlthough some children learn an instrument prior to entering a middle school (or junior high), students in music education programs within the United States and Canada generally start daily band classes in the 6th or 7th Grade. Many band programs begin as early as 4th or 5th grade. The students usually make up a band based upon their grade, which may then be broken up into sectionals to provide better instrument-specific instruction. It is sometimes required for beginner students to play a recorder for a year before learning another instrument, so that basics, such as scales, embouchure, etc. can be taught easily. Other requirements may include learning a piano or guitar to understand basic music theory, notation, etc.\n\nA \"beginning\" band, consisting of the youngest students in the school, usually gives two or three concerts a year, and may participate in a local/state contest. These bands are given easy music to learn, often with many duplicate parts and simple rhythms. Students sometimes may be required to memorize the 12 major scales.\nDepending upon the size of the school, there may be one to three \"higher level\" bands after the beginning band. These bands are usually divided similarly to high school bands. Some schools require students to audition and be placed in a band according to their ability on their instrument. Others will assign students based on their performance as seen in class. Yet others will simply sort the students according to their age or grade level. Most of these decisions are decided by the conductor. These higher level bands will occasionally play in high school games and pep rallies to augment the local high school band, although in small schools they always come to these events. Beginning bands usually are used in the spot of an elective.\n\nInstruments typically in beginning bands:\n\n\nSome bands will also have a \"percussion kit\", which will allow them to play bells and drums\n\nHigh school bands typically challenge students musically more than those in middle school. Music is much more difficult with more complex passages, intricate rhythms and more involved phrasing. Selections also vary in style. A well-rounded band is expected to be able to play a wide variety of music, ranging from serious 'program music' to lighter 'pop-style' music. For many high school students, school bands are the main form of music education available to them in school. Marches were the first major contributions to the wind band repertoire. There are many pieces other than marches written for wind band at present, but there are some historical standards that should be included into the repertoire of advanced ensembles. Some of the most notable of these pieces are Holst's \"First Suite in E-flat\" and \"Second Suite in F\", and Grainger's \"Children's March\" and \"Lincolnshire Posy\" among others.\n\nBelow is a list of the instrumentation in a typical concert band at the high school level. The number of instruments in each section varies, but listed below are usually the average number of members. Middle school/junior high bands are usually around the upper values for each instrument. Instrumentation in beginner bands is usually much larger than this. College and professional bands generally have smaller numbers of players. These numbers may vary widely, based on the instrument and the people playing them (as many people playing instruments such as trombones may drop out, causing others to change instruments to fill the need). Some bands have a set number of performers per section while other bands have open unlimited participation.\n\nWoodwind\n\nBrass\n\nStrings\n\nPercussion\n\nIn most middle school bands, strings (besides the string bass) are not used. If they are, the band is generally considered an orchestra.\n\nThe first high school band in the United States was the Boston Farm and Trade School Band, founded in 1856.\nThe oldest high school band in America is The Christian Brothers Band (Memphis) founded in 1882.\n\nMany colleges/universities have band as a class. Some are integrated within a 'Music' course while others are not. They tend to be larger than a high school band and play at a higher level.\n\nThere are many other school band opportunities for students. Most of these fall under the jurisdiction of the director that teaches the daily band classes, whether or not the smaller groups meet daily or during school hours.\n\nMany schools, especially high schools in the United States, have a marching band. A school marching band may contain from 11 to over 500 students. Marching bands often practice frequently during the late summer and early fall and most often attend their school's football games, playing music in the stands, and marching a show during halftime. A show is usually between 6 and 10 minutes long, but many competitions place restrictions on length. Bands often compete in marching band competitions throughout the marching season (typically the same time as football season). Competitions vary in intensity. Some areas have many smaller, local competitions hosted by individual schools. Others host a regional competition. Others, such as Bands of America competitions are nationally known and take place in professional arenas.\n\nIn addition to their show, marching bands often march parades. Often this is limited to their city or town's municipal parades, but some bands travel to participate in well known parades, such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade or the Tournament of Roses Parade on New Years Day.\n\nMany schools have jazz programs in addition to their concert program. Different schools have different time slots for their jazz band. Some meet as an actual class during the school day. Others choose to practice after school or before school two or three times a week. Meeting as a class during school can often cause schedule conflicts with students' academic classes. Many times jazz band may rehearse during the study hall, free period, or part of the lunch period. Typical instrumentation for jazz ensembles will include trumpets, trombones, alto, tenor and baritone saxophones, a drum set (often called a \"trap set\"), guitar, bass guitar, piano, clarinet and often, a vibraphone or marimba. Many areas have jazz festivals, but the popularity of these widely vary from different regions of the country. Jazz bands are most often used as an ambassador ensemble for the band program as a whole. In addition, jazz education is seen as growing in popularity as a specialty area within school music departments.\n\nSchools rarely have chamber music ensembles that meet as real classes, usually depending on the region, state and budget. Most of these groups are \"ad hoc\" ensembles put together by the director or the students themselves for a contest or recital. Examples would be clarinet quartets, woodwind quintet, brass quintet, duets, and trios. Groups consisting of the entire woodwind or brass section, or even percussion section of a band are also sometimes formed.\n\nPerhaps not associated with the individual school, All-Region bands are audition-only groups for the most advanced players in each school. There are many different \"All-Region\" bands, ranging from the most local \"All-County\" or \"All-District\"(when referring to school districts) to the more prestigious \"All-State\". Many states also have a level between County and State bands which varies in name according to the area. These events are often highly enjoyed by the students that attend them. Musical literature is often increased in difficulty for the concerts, providing a challenge that isn't seen at schools. Students also get to meet new players on their instrument and share stories from their own band experiences. Region bands typically last over a weekend, though some may meet for over a week before performing a concert.\n\nThough not associated with All-State, Florida has a statewide band festival called Festival of Winds, held in Tampa at The University of South Florida in the first weekend of December. Also, Florida, Alabama, and Georgia have a band festival called Tri-State, held in Tallahassee, Florida at Florida State University in the same time period as Festival of Winds.\n\nModern band is an instrumental and vocal school music program taught in a growing number of public schools systems in the U.S. Instrumentation typically includes acoustic guitar, electric guitar, electric bass, keyboard, vocals, computers and percussion instruments. The repertoire of modern band is evolving as it draws from commercially dominant and contemporary music styles of the day such as pop, rock, disco, reggae, hip-hop and more.\n\nMajor public school systems that offer Modern Band programming include those in the New York City Department of Education, Los Angeles Unified School District, Chicago Public Schools and others. Modern band is a new movement in public school music education circles. The term \"Modern Band\" was coined by a music education non-profit, Little Kids Rock, who partners with school districts from economically challenged communities to expand their music programs.\n\n\"Band geek\" or \"band nerd\" is a high school stereotype of a person obsessed with playing band music. However, the term usually relates to the belief that most people who are in school bands are socially inept. The term is sometimes used to describe any student who plays an instrument and is in a band class (including students in the orchestra). \"Orch dork\" is a variation specifically for members of school orchestras. These terms have become a label of pride for many band members, being found on T-shirts, bumper stickers, etc.\n\nIn school bands, more females than males tend to play most woodwind instruments, especially flute, and more males than females tend to play brass instruments, saxophone, and percussion. However, this is not always the case.\n\nThese stereotypes can be avoided when band directors assess each student for musical capacity, as well as, meet with students individually to analyze their physical characteristics. For example, petite students would be more successful playing the clarinet over the tuba. Additionally, the role of gender bias in musical instrument assignment is highly debated in the field of music education. Some feel that it should be left alone while others want to combat it. One way band directors can overcome these stereotypes is to have live demonstrations from musicians playing gender atypical instruments (i.e., males playing flute, females playing tuba).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are depicted as being Mojo-manufactured child clones of the X-Men. They first appeared in \"Uncanny X-Men Annual\" #12 and were created by Chris Claremont and Art Adams.\n\nIn \"Uncanny X-Men Annual\" #10 (also by Chris Claremont and Art Adams), Mojo had de-aged the X-Men into children; this is what most likely inspired the creation of the X-Babies.\n\nIn \"Uncanny X-Men Annual\" #12, the X-Men are assumed to be dead (having died in Dallas, only to be resurrected by the goddess Roma). Mojo, missing his greatest rating generators, had his people try to recreate his own version of the X-Men. After many unsuccessful attempts, the X-Babies were created. They soon rebel against Mojo. Mojo was about to kill them when he was told that their instant ratings were the highest ever recorded.\n\nThere have been several incarnations of the X-Babies over the years, usually resembling whatever the current team of X-Men is. There has also been a similar team instead based on the Avengers, called the \"Mitey 'Vengers\", who appeared in the \"X-Babies Reborn\" one-shot. There have also been several X-Babies villain teams including the \"Brotherhood of Bullies\" based on the Brotherhood of Mutants (\"X-Babies Murderama\", 1998).\n\nIn \"Excalibur: Mojo Mayhem\" (1989), Kitty Pryde, interrupted on a train trip, helps a team of X-Babies flee from a Mojo enforcer who is intent on getting them back by tricking them into signing contracts. In this incarnation, the children's childlike faults and crushes on each other are cruelly exploited by their adversary. Kitty, with backup, ends up saving the day.\n\nSeveral incarnations of the X-Babies are friendly with Ricochet Rita, the good past-self of the villain Spiral. Due to Spiral's time travel abilities, Rita, the babies and Spiral can all exist at the same period simultaneously.\n\nIn X-Men #46-47 (1995), an X-Babies team is on the run from Mojo's hunters. Gambit and Bishop try to keep them alive. \n\nIn \"Exiles\" #8, it is shown that the reality-hopping Exiles encountered a version of the X-Babies. It is not stated whether these X-Babies are the creation of Mojo or the X-Men of the reality in question. In fact, no further details are given except for the narrative commentary \"The less said about this, the better.\" The X-Baby Wolvie would then become a permanent member.\n\nDazzler would encounter juvenile versions of the four main villains from the Age of Apocalypse timelines. These entities would cause major death and destruction throughout Mojoworld.\n\nThe X-Men were once again reduced to infancy by Mojo during \"Uncanny X-Men\" #461 (2005). As kids, they were able to defeat the villains, parody lawyer-versions of the Exiles. and restore their rightful ages. Juggernaut had second thoughts about returning to adulthood but was convinced to go through with it.\n\nIn the X-Babies four issue limited series (2009/2010) the X-Babies discover their position as Mojo's number one rating grabber had been usurped by the newer, cuter, but more shallow in personality 'Adorable X-Babies.'\n\nAs a tie-in to the \"Avengers Vs. X-Men\" event, a spoof comic called \"A-Babies Vs. X-Babies\" #1 (2012) has been released.\n\nIn line with Mojo being a parody of network executives, the X-Babies parody the modern trend of creating younger and junior versions of cartoon characters which began in the 1980s with \"Jim Henson's Muppet Babies\". In comics, Superbaby and Wonder Tot had appeared in Superboy and Wonder Woman comics from the 1950s and 1960s respectively.\n\n\n\n"}

This facility also tested instruments and equipment for polar expeditions. The ATOLL hull was the largest fiberglass structure ever built at that time. It was in operation from 1982 to 1995.\n\nThe ATOLL was composed of three curved fiberglass elements, each long and having a draught of only . For towing, the elements could be assembled in a long S-shape; in operation, the elements would form a horseshoe shape surrounding water surface. The lab provided ample space for twelve researchers. The laboratory contained a lab, storage and supply facilities, a dormitory, computer room, and a fireplace.\n\nThe laboratory was installed and operated in the Baltic Sea (and the Bay of Kiel in particular) at the initiative and under the direction of Uwe Kils, at the Institute of Oceanography (\"Institut für Meereskunde\") of the University of Kiel. The fiberglass hulls themselves were bought from Waki Zöllner's \"Atoll\" company.\n\nThe onboard computer was a NeXT and the first versions of a virtual microscope of Antarctic krill for interactive dives into their morphology and behavior were developed here, finding later mention in Science magazine. The lab was connected to the Internet via a radio link, and the first images of ocean critters on the internet came from this NeXT. The first ever \"in situ\" videos of Atlantic herring feeding on copepods were recorded from this lab.\nAn underwater observation and experimentation room allowed direct observation and manipulation through large portholes.\n\nThe technical equipment included an ultra-high-resolution scanning sonar that was used for locating schools of juvenile herring, for guiding a ROV, which was controlled via a cyberhelmet and glove, and for determining positions, distances, and speeds. Probes measured the water salinity, temperature, and oxygen levels. Special instruments could measure plankton-, particle-, and bubble-concentrations and their size distributions. Imaging equipment included low-light still and high speed video cameras using shuttered Laser-sheet or infrared LED illumination. An endoscope-system for non-invasive optical measurements called ecoSCOPE, which could also be mounted on an ROV, was developed and used to record the microscale dynamics and behavior of the highly evasive herring.\n\nScientific investigations aboard the ATOLL concentrated on one of the most important food chain transitions: the linkages between the early life stages of herring (\"Clupea harengus\") and their principal prey, the copepods. A major hypotheses of fisheries ecologists is that the microdistribution of prey, the microturbulence of the ocean, or the retention conditions are normally not suited to allow strong year classes of fish to develop. In most years more than 99% of herring larvae do not survive. Occasionally however, physical and biotic conditions are favorable, larval survival is high, and large year-classes result. Research work at the ATOLL investigated the effects of small-scale dynamics on fish feeding and predator avoidance and their correlation to year-class strength.\nResearch questions investigated by students during courses and their thesis work at the Laboratory included: What are the effects of the natural light gradient on predator-prey interactions? How can the predator best see the prey without being seen? How does the focussing of small waves oscillating light regime influence camouflage and attack strategy? What are the influences of the different frequencies of microturbulences? How do such effects change at the moment when herring larvae join into schools? What role does the phenomenon of aggregation play? Do ocean physics create or alter organism-aggregations? Can the dynamics of aggregations effect ocean physics at the microscales? Are there effects of the surface waves? What are the distribution and dynamics of microbubbles caused by turbulences and gas-oversaturations? How can the organisms orient in respect to micro-gradients of the ocean physics? How do they survive in the direct vicinity of undulating anoxia and hypoxia? Why are eelpouts, sticklebacks and herrings so extremely successful in the Baltic while cod is not? What are the effects and functions of schooling for feeding and microscale-orientation? What is the behavior of fish in netcages and how much food is lost from the cages.\nThe ATOLL mainly served as a test bed for the development and field testing of equipment such as developing ROVs that were to be used later in Antarctic expeditions, e.g. for \"in situ\" imaging of transparent organisms of krill size under the ice.\n\n"}

In the diagram, θ is the central angle in radians, formula_1 the radius of the circle, and formula_2 is the arc length of the minor sector.\n\nA sector with the central angle of 180° is called a half-disk and is bounded by a diameter and a semicircle. Sectors with other central angles are sometimes given special names, these include quadrants (90°), sextants (60°) and octants (45°), which come from the sector being one 4th, 6th or 8th part of a full circle, respectively. Confusingly, the arc of a quadrant can also be termed a quadrant.\n\nThe angle formed by connecting the endpoints of the arc to any point on the circumference that is not in the sector is equal to half the central angle.\n\nThe total area of a circle is \"r\".

The original version, no longer under development, is a set of NetWare Loadable Modules (NLMs) which runs on all versions of the Novell NetWare network operating system (NOS) from 3.x to 6.x (current ). It worked in conjunction with MS-DOS workstations running Pegasus Mail.\n\nMercury/32 is a Win32 application running on all versions of Microsoft Windows from Windows 98 and Windows NT4 to the latest () Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 (Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 are recommended).\n\nEither version can act as a mail server for a LAN; both have additional support for some NetWare LAN features.\nMercury is a fully independent mail server and can provide email services to all standards-compliant email clients, such as Eudora or Microsoft Outlook. Both versions of Mercury are highly modular, allowing support for different sets of Internet protocols to be installed as required. Mercury can also be installed tightly integrated with Pegasus Mail. The combination of Pegasus/Mercury is similar to the mail aspects of Microsoft Outlook/Microsoft Exchange Server. Mercury was originally developed to handle mail, both internal and external, on Netware servers in either bindery or NDS mode; Mercury ran on the system server, and integrated with Pegasus mail running on MS-DOS or Windows workstations.\n\nMercury is extremely standards-compliant, supporting all major Internet mail-related protocols including SMTP (for both sending and receiving mail), POP3 and IMAP. The Win32 version also supports a dialup connection. Both versions have many features, with especially powerful support for managed mailing lists. Mercury is intended to be largely unobtrusive and needs little ongoing maintenance.\n\nThe installation process is a simple task, taking less than a minute. At this point, the user must indicate the domain parameter to be used. The user list is manually administered. There is no limit in numbers of users declared. A single directory holds users storage locations, so to do a backup just copy the \"mail\" directory and it will copy all users' data.\n\nAlso, a standard anti-virus could be used. After a mail is received, two files are created. When these files are finally written to disk, a simple antivirus engine could scan it. There is CLAMAV antivirus engine supplied, to be used as desired.\n\nThe software has an enormous variety of configurations. Using proper care, the server could be very secure. The relay control is very effective, and the ability to filter mails based in many rules, making it very efficient. Could use blacklist/whitelist technology. There are included tools to reduce spam effects.\n\n\nMercury/32, while not open source software, can be extended by anyone as the development documentation is free and publicly available at the pmail community. Below are some well known extensions, some bundled with Mercury/32.\n\nDevelopment on the version for Netware had basically stopped after the release of version 1.48 on 26 May 2000, and replacement by the Windows version was recommended. (A security patch, bringing the Mercury NLM version to 1.49, was released in August 2007.)\n\nOn 19 June 2009 David Harris announced on the Pegasus Mail site that all development of Pegasus Mail and the associated Mercury program could only continue if sufficient users would commit to donating US$50 annually; on 21 July 2009 he said that there had been a good start.\n\nNew versions of both programs have been released since. Developer David Harris said in April 2017 that both Pegasus Mail and the Mercury transport system were under active and major further development. In July 2019 he announced that the \"Mercury v5 is very near to going into beta\". On 25 December 2019 he said that, while there has been a delay due to health issues, he \"can only promise you that there is progress, and that <nowiki>[he is]</nowiki> totally committed to getting these new versions released\" and he is working, among others, on support for OAuth2 and OpenSSL v 1.1.1 and he expects \"to have builds of Mercury v5 available to testers and interested users in the first three months of the New Year\".\n\nThe XAMPP is an initiative by Apache Friends to develop a cross-platform web server solution pack with the main core components of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB or MySQL database and the PHP and perl interpreters, intended to be a cross platform equivalent of the LAMP stack used on Linux. While mail systems are natively distributed with the Linux operating system this was not the case for the Microsoft Windows platform and Apache Friends selected Mercury MTS for this component. There are no specific documents provided by Apache Friends for installation or configuration of XAMPP or its components with the concept of providing information via FAQs and forums, however some third party descriptions of the configuration and use of the Mercury MTS component are available.\n\n"}

It encompasses \"Serious Jungle\" (2002), \"Serious Desert\" (2003), \"Serious Arctic\" (2005), \"Serious Amazon\" (2006), \"Serious Andes\" (2007), \"Serious Ocean\" (2008) and \"Serious Explorers\" (2011). \"Serious Ocean\" consisted of ten 30-minute episodes, while each previous series was six 30-minute episodes. In each series a group of eight 12- to 15-year-olds embark on an expedition to an extreme part of the world, in order to help wildlife or assist in environmental projects. The programmes have won numerous awards, among them honours from BAFTA and the Royal Television Society.\n\nSo far only \"Serious Amazon\", \"Serious Ocean\" and \"Serious Andes\" have been aired in Australia, on ABC1 and ABC3.\nThe series has also been shown on Discovery Kids/The Hub, where five complete seasons have been shown. Slovenian television Kanal A has bought the rights to air \"Serious Amazon\". The show airs Saturdays at 2:10 pm, under the title \"Vse o Amazonki\" (\"All About the Amazon\").\n\nThe Italian television network RAI in early 2009 aired \"Serious Jungle\", \"Serious Desert\", \"Serious Arctic\", \"Serious Amazon\", and \"Serious Andes\".\n\n\"Serious Jungle\" aired in 2002. Chosen from 1,000 applicants, eight adventurers faced a mission to build a feeding platform in the heart of the Borneo jungle, to help return orangutans to the wild (many of them rescued after being illegally kept as pets). They were in the rainforest for three weeks. The \"Serious Jungle\" eight were accompanied by expedition leaders Bruce Parry and Emma Jay.\n\nLarry gave an interview in 2007, giving advice to those about to apply for \"Serious Ocean\", as well as some advice for successful applicants.\n\n\"Serious Desert\" aired from 20 to 31 October 2003. After 6,500 applications, eight adventurers were chosen to travel to Namibia and try and save the endangered black rhinoceros. They sleep under tarpaulin in the dunes and see black rhinos, but also wildebeest, zebra, springbok, giraffes, jackals, snakes, scorpions and elephants. Filming from 13 April to 5 May 2003, they build a new camel enclosure and finally make an epic fifty mile trek across the Namibian sand dunes to the Skeleton Coast. Returning from the previous series, Bruce Parry and Emma Jay were the expedition leaders who led the team.\n\n<nowiki>* </nowiki>Ellie celebrated her 14th birthday during the expedition.\n\nAlong with Larry from the previous series, Promise was interviewed in 2007, giving her opinion on what it was like to have the cameras following her around on the expedition.\n\n\"Serious Arctic\" aired from 5 February to 6 March 2005. Chosen from 9,000 applicants, eight adventurers flew to Baffin Island, Canada, where they made an attempt to track polar bears across the pack ice, riding on husky sleds, with the season being filmed from 4 to 24 April 2004. Blizzards made the trip a hazard, and they spent most of one week in their tents. \"Serious Arctic\" was also the most successful \"Serious\" series picking up five awards. The expedition leaders for this trip were Ben Major and Emma Jay.\n\n<nowiki>* </nowiki>Adam and Fabian both celebrated their 13th birthdays during the expedition.\n\n\"Serious Amazon\" aired from 25 February to 26 March 2006, and had a then-record of 29,000 12- to 15-year-olds auditioning for a part. The chosen team of eight left for Peru on 9 July 2005, with a mission to help rare uakari monkeys and pink river dolphins caught in illegal fishing nets in the Amazon River. The team of eight removed the illegal fishing nets to leave the dolphins safe, and also built habitats for the bald uakari. The season finished filming on 29 July. The \"Serious Amazon\" eight were accompanied by expedition leaders Ben Major and Polly Murray.\n\n\"Serious Andes\" aired from 4 June to 20 August 2007 and followed eight adventurers who, after being chosen from a then-record 36,000 12-to-15-year-olds, travelled to Ecuador to build an enclosure for spectacled bears. They also set out to climb the Cotopaxi volcano, the youngest team ever to have done so. Only four of the adventurers (Erin, Kylie, Will and Caitlin) were able to conquer the volcano, as the other four adventurers (Sarah, Liam, Matt and Joshua) were unable to do so, with some succumbing to early symptoms of acute mountain sickness. The season was filmed between 12 July and 3 August 2006. The \"Serious Andes\" eight were again accompanied by leaders Ben Major and Polly Murray. There was also a special episode that featured behind the scenes moments in the making of \"Serious Andes\", called \"Serious Andes: Extra.\n\n\"Serious Ocean\" was filmed in November and December 2007 featuring eight adventurers travelling to the isolated coast of Chile, living on a boat, assisting research into penguins, dolphins and albatrosses before moving on to assist in the survey of Glacier Chloe, the most southerly glacier outside Antarctica. The highlight of the trip, however, was when they sailed around Cape Horn, becoming one of the youngest teams ever to do so. The \"Serious Ocean\" eight were once again accompanied by expedition leaders Ben Major and Polly Murray. The series was first aired on July 2008.\n\nA book of the series was released during December 2007, entitled \"Serious Survival: How to Poo in the Arctic and Other Essential Tips\", owing to the success of its broadcasting history. Written by the Series Producer Marshall Corwin, \"Serious Survival\" was shortlisted for the prestigious Royal Society Junior Science Books Prize.\n\n<nowiki>* </nowiki>Robyn celebrated her 13th birthday at the beginning of the trip.\n\nInitially, the next \"Serious\" series was to be filmed in China, and would have followed the journey of 13th-century explorer, Marco Polo, including joining a camel train in the Taklamakan Desert, climbing mountains, and spending time with local tribes. However, after travelling to the region, due to political unrest Serious Explorers was postponed and the team returned to the UK. The series was later rescheduled to film in Tanzania in Africa at the end of 2009, where the team would follow in the foot steps of explorer David Livingstone.\n\nApplications were accepted through January 2009. Around 900 of the applicants, from over 14,000, had a phone interview before 120 were selected to go to London, Bristol or Manchester for a day of auditions. 16 were selected to go to Wales for a selection weekend until it was cut down to the final 8. However, another contestant was removed for having to undergo an emergency tonsil operation, narrowing down the field to seven. Eventually, seven contestants aged 12–15 (four boys and three girls) were selected to take part in the show. The expedition took place in late 2009, with the intention of broadcasting the series in early 2010.\n\nHowever, during filming, expedition guide Anton Turner died when he was mauled by an elephant on 30 October 2009, and production was reported to have ceased. Despite this, the series began broadcasting as \"Serious Explorers: Livingstone\" in early 2011. During the expedition three of the most promising of the seven explorers were chosen to cross the Mbarika mountain range, while the remaining four stayed behind to build an enclosure to fend off lions in a village; in the final episode, having come close to their target, the death of Anton was reported, who had gone out in advance of the day's trek over Mbarika to ensure the walk would be safe. Expedition leader Ben immediately called a halt to the Mbarika trek, and the series ended.\n\nIn late 2010, CBBC began to look for participants for a new Serious Explorers for production in early 2011 which followed the explorers led by Walter Raleigh sailing from Trinidad and Tobago to Guyana. The applications were cut down from around 12,000 to 300, who were given phone auditions in late October. The next stage was a Skype audition which took place in early November. The Skype audition was a new concept which is currently being trialled. 105 people were picked to go to an audition in Manchester or London on 23 November 2010 (Manchester) and 25 November 2010 (London). 16 children were picked for a final auditions weekend in December, where the final eight were chosen. The final eight started their journey on 31 January 2011. \nThe series began broadcasting in September 2011 and finished broadcasting in December 2011. There were 10 episodes and 1 special episode called \"Serious Survival\"\n\n\nThe \"Serious\" show has had a remarkable record for winning awards, with each of the first seven series gaining honours and total awards into double figures. The show has won four BAFTA children's awards in the Factual category: for \"Serious Desert\" in the 2004 nominations, for \"Serious Arctic\" in the 2005 nominations, for \"Serious Andes\" in 2008 and for \"Serious Ocean\" in 2010. \"Serious Amazon\" was also nominated in 2006 for the same category. The Royal Television Society has also given the series three awards; Best Children's Programme in 2002 for \"Serious Jungle\", 2005 for \"Serious Arctic\" and 2007 for \"Serious Andes\". In addition, the \"Serious Arctic\" series won a 2006 Prix Jeunesse International (Children's Jury Prize), along with a Broadcast Award and a Bulldog Award.\n\"Serious Ocean\" won the Maritime Media Award 2008, beating off competition from adult series such as the BBC's \"Trawlermen\" and Channel 5's \"Warship\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1967292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967292", "title": "Facial symmetry", "text": "Facial symmetry\n\nFacial symmetry is one specific measure of bodily symmetry. Along with traits such as averageness and youthfulness it influences judgments of aesthetic traits of physical attractiveness and beauty. For instance, in mate selection, people have been shown to have a preference for symmetry. \n\nFacial symmetry has been suggested as a possible physical manifestation of the 'big-five' personality traits. \n\nFacial bilateral symmetry is typically defined as fluctuating asymmetry of the face comparing random differences in facial features of the two sides of the face. The human face also has systematic, directional asymmetry: on average, the face (mouth, nose and eyes) sits systematically to the left with respect to the axis through the ears, the so-called \"aurofacial asymmetry\".\n\nDirectional asymmetry is a systematic asymmetry of some parts of the face across the population. A theory of directional asymmetries in the human body is the axial twist hypothesis. As predicted by this theory, the eyes, nose and mouth are, on average, located slightly to the left of the axias through the ears. This aurofacial asymmetry is very small in young adults (0.5 degree), but much larger in small children (4 degrees). \n\nFluctuating asymmetry is the non-systematic variation of individual facial landmarks with respect to the facial midline, i.e., the line perpendicular to the line through the eyes, which crosses the tip of the nose and the chin. \n\nA wide variety of methods have been used to examine the claim that facial symmetry plays a role in judgments of beauty. Blending of multiple faces to create a composite and face-half mirroring have been among the techniques used.\n\nConclusions derived from face mirroring, however, have been called into question, because it has been shown that mirroring face-halves creates artificial features. For example, if the nose of an individual is slightly bent to the right side, then mirroring the right side of the face will lead to an over-sized nose, while mirroring the left side will lead to an unnaturally small nose.\n\nFacial symmetry has been found to increase ratings of attractiveness in human faces. More symmetrical faces are perceived as more attractive in both males and females, although facial symmetry plays a larger role in judgments of attractiveness concerning female faces. \n\nWhile studies employing the composite faces produced results that indicate that more symmetrical faces are perceived as more attractive, studies applying the face-half mirroring technique have indicated that humans prefer slight asymmetry. Also, studies have shown that nearly symmetrical faces are considered highly attractive as compared to asymmetrical ones. The symmetry of the nose seems to be more important than that of the lips.\n\nHighly conspicuous directional asymmetries can be temporary ones. For example, during speech, most people (76%) tend to express greater amplitude of movement on the right side of their mouth. This is most likely caused by the uneven strengths of contralateral neural connections between the left hemisphere of the brain (linguistic localization) and the right side of the face. Also, lying distorts the symmetric balance of the facial musculature. \n\nExperiments suggest that symmetry and averageness make independent contributions to attractiveness.\n\nFacial symmetry is also a valid marker of cognitive aging. Progressive changes occurring throughout life in the soft tissues of the face will cause more prominent facial asymmetry in older faces. Therefore, symmetrical transformation of older faces generally increases their attractiveness while symmetrical transformation in young adults and children will decrease their attractiveness. Males with more symmetric faces in old age have higher intelligence and are more efficient at information processing than males with less symmetric faces.\n\nResearch indicates that facial symmetry is correlated with the 'big-five' model of personality. The five factors are:\n\nA consistent finding is that facial symmetry is positively correlated with extraversion, indicating that individuals with more symmetric faces are also more extroverted. More symmetrical faces are also judged to be lower on neuroticism but higher on conscientiousness and agreeableness. More symmetrical faces are also more likely to have more desirable social attributes assigned to them, such as sociable, intelligent or lively.\n\nHowever, the relationship of facial symmetry and the 'big-five' personality model remains somewhat unclear with regard to neuroticism, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness. Openness and agreeableness appear to be significantly negatively related to facial symmetry, while neuroticism and conscientiousness do not seem to be linked to facial symmetry. With respect to trustworthiness it has been found that the facial muscles become imbalanced when lying.\n\nSexual selection is a theoretical construct within evolution theory. According to sexual selection, mate choice can have profound influence on the preferred features. Sexual selection can only influence features that potential mates can perceive, such as smell, audition (e.g. song) and vision. Such features might be reliable indicators of hidden fitness parameters such as a good immune system or developmental stability.\n\nIt has been argued that more symmetric faces are preferred because symmetry might be a reliable sign of such hidden fitness parameters. However it is possible that high facial symmetry in an individual is not due to their superior genetics but due to a lack of exposure to stressors during development. \n\nIt has been found that more symmetrical faces are rated as healthier than less symmetrical faces. Indeed, facial symmetry was found to be positively associated with the perceived healthiness of the facial skin. Also, facial asymmetry was found to be correlated with physiological, psychological and emotional distress.\n\nSome evidence suggests that face preferences in adults might be correlated to infections in childhood.\n\n\n"}

Released only months before Hughes's death, the collection won multiple prestigious literary awards. This collection of eighty-eight poems is widely considered to be Hughes's most explicit response to the suicide of his estranged wife Sylvia Plath in 1963, and to their widely discussed, politicized and \"explosive\" marriage.\n\nUntil the publication of this book, 35 years after Plath's suicide, Hughes had said and published nearly nothing about his relationship and life with Plath. When it was discovered that he had infidelities while with Plath and had destroyed some of Plath's works after her death, some critics depicted him as a monster and Plath as a victim. In one instance, Hughes's name was chipped off Plath's tombstone in Yorkshire.\n\nThe \"Ted Hughes controversy\" concerned his possible role in Plath's suicide and subsequent attempts at controlling the finished products of her poetry. The speculation resulted in extra-literary attention on Plath and Hughes and, consequently, their works as poets. Poems including The Blue Flannel Suit directly address their relationship, and many are directly addressed to Plath herself.\n\nAfter her death in 1963, Plath's wish to leave behind a meaningful legacy was fulfilled when her \"Ariel\" collection of poetry, and her semi-autobiographical novel \"The Bell Jar\", were hailed as masterpieces of modern feminism, causing her to become a feminist icon in the 1970s. Hughes's apparent wish for redemption is realized in this autobiographical collection of poetry. The literary response to the publication of this collection was one of sensation. It was unknown at the time that Hughes was suffering from a terminal disease that may have prompted this unexpected release.\n\nHughes's \"Birthday Letters\" topped the best-seller lists immediately. This was arguably due to public fascination with a persistent mystery surrounding the lives of the two icons. Within a short period of time the collection was awarded the Forward Poetry Prize, the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry and the Whitbread Poetry and Whitbread British Book of the Year prizes.\n\n"}
{"id": "1967305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967305", "title": "2005 Northern Territory general election", "text": "2005 Northern Territory general election\n\nA general election was held in the Northern Territory, Australia, on 18 June 2005. The centre-left Labor Party, led by Chief Minister Clare Martin, won a second term with a landslide victory, winning six of the ten seats held by the opposition Country Liberal Party in the 25-member Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, bringing their total to 19. It was the second largest victory in any Northern Territory election. The only larger majority in the history of the Territory was in the first election, in 1974. In that contest, the CLP won 17 of the 19 seats in the chamber, and faced only two independents as opposition.\n\nThe most notable casualty was Opposition Leader Denis Burke's loss of his own seat of Brennan. It was only the second time a party leader in the Territory had been defeated in his own electorate, after Majority Leader Goff Letts losing his seat of Victoria River in 1977.\n\nThe Labor Party won 52.5% of the primary vote, which was an increase of 11.9% over the 2001 election. The opposition Country Liberal Party polled 35.3%, a drop of 10.1% from 2001. The two party preferred result was Labor on 59.1% to the CLP on 40.9%, a swing to Labor of 11.1% from the previous election. The Northern Territory Greens ran an increased number of candidates, and managed to increase their vote through much of Darwin, but had very little effect on the outcome of the election.\n\nLabor won 19 seats against the CLP's four seats. Two independent members, Loraine Braham and Gerry Wood, were also re-elected. While Labor had been favoured to win a second term, most commentators had predicted a gain of one or two seats at best. The size of the Labor landslide took even the most optimistic Labor observers by surprise. Labor took six seats off the CLP. Five of them – Brennan, Daly, Drysdale, Goyder and Port Darwin – were formerly safely conservative seats that Labor had never won before in the history of the Assembly. The ALP also retrieved the seat of MacDonnell, which had been a comfortably safe Labor seat until its shock fall to the CLP in 1997. The CLP also very narrowly failed to win back the formerly safe seat of Braitling from independent Loraine Braham, despite a strong challenge from CLP candidate Michael Jones.\n\nAmidst what was their worst ever result, the CLP did have some good news in two seats which the ALP had been openly hoping to win. The ALP had run Fran Kilgariff, the very high-profile Mayor of Alice Springs and daughter of CLP founder Bernie Kilgariff as their candidate in Greatorex, against CLP Deputy Leader Dr Richard Lim. Despite Kilgariff's profile and the massive swing against the CLP elsewhere in the Territory, Lim managed to very narrowly retain his seat. There was a swing to the CLP in only one seat – Araluen, where leadership aspirant Jodeen Carney comfortably retained what had been the most marginal CLP-held seat.\n\nThe severity of the landslide result was all the more surprising considering that the ALP had never before been in government until 2001. The Legislative Assembly had been created in 1974, and the CLP had held government for an unbroken stretch of 27 years before Clare Martin won the ALP's first victory in 2001. The victory was seen in many cases not only as an endorsement of Martin's leadership, but also an endorsement of Labor's ability to govern. The CLP had consistently alleged that the ALP was unfit to govern the Territory, and had used this as a key tactic during election campaigns many times in the past. However, it was also seen as being a vote of no-confidence in the opposition, and in the days after the election result, conservative Prime Minister John Howard strongly criticised the CLP for what he saw as their poor performance in opposition. Furthermore, the reduction of the CLP to just four seats raised questions as to whether it was viable for them to continue to be separate from the Liberal-National Coalition, which operates at federal level and in every other state and territory.\n\nThere were several prominent casualties of the election, but none was more significant or surprising than the defeat of Opposition Leader Denis Burke in the Palmerston-area seat of Brennan. Brennan was the CLP's safest seat anywhere in the Territory, with a CLP majority of 19 percent. The ALP had never come close to winning any seats in Palmerston before. There had been no suggestion from any major commentators or opinion polls that Burke was even remotely under threat, but he was swept aside on election day with a swing against him of more than 21%. The ALP candidate, James Burke, a virtually unknown labor lawyer, expressed shock at his own win, and became a party legend overnight. Denis Burke had already stated that he would resign as party leader if he lost the election, but the loss of his seat forced the party to find a new leader immediately. The four remaining CLP members unanimously replaced Burke with Shadow Attorney-General and Shadow Health Minister Jodeen Carney. Another shock result came in Daly in the remote northern portion of the Territory. It had previously been a reasonably safe CLP seat; retiring member Tim Baldwin held it with a majority of 9.5 percent. However, Labor challenger Rob Knight took the seat on an unheard-of swing of 24 percent, turning it into a safe Labor seat in one stroke.\n\nWhile the loss of Burke was a major shock, the defeat of three other CLP sitting members, Sue Carter (Port Darwin) Stephen Dunham (Drysdale) and John Elferink (MacDonnell) also posed major problems for the party. Elferink had been the Leader of Opposition Business, Opposition Whip and Shadow Minister for Community Development, Housing, Local Government, Sport and Recreation, Regional Development, and Indigenous Affairs, Dunham had been the Shadow Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, Lands and Planning, Parks and Wildlife and Essential Services, and Carter had been the Shadow Minister for Family and Community Services, Environment and Heritage, Arts and Museums and Women's Policy. In the aftermath of their defeat, all of these portfolios had to be redistributed among the four remaining CLP members, Carney (Araluen), Dr Richard Lim (Greatorex) Fay Miller (Katherine) and Terry Mills (Blain). This has raised concerns from both sides of politics about the CLP's ability to mount any form of effective opposition in the new parliament.\n\nThe two independent members of the outgoing parliament, disendorsed former CLP minister Loraine Braham and former Litchfield Mayor Gerry Wood both managed to retain their seats. In the lead-up to the election, there had been some suggestion that Wood may have some difficulty retaining his seat, but Braham had been widely expected to win another term. The final result turned out to be the opposite; Wood cruised to victory with a massive 15 percent swing in his favour, whereas Braham very narrowly retained her seat in a result that was not known for several days after the election. The election was a disappointment for other independent candidates; Wood's successor as Litchfield Mayor, Mary Walshe, fell well short of expectations in Goyder, and Wadeye councillor Dale Seaniger failed to make much impact in Daly.\n\nAs in past elections, minor parties failed to make much impact at the 2005 election. While the Northern Territory Greens ran an increased number of candidates and increased their votes, none of their candidates, including leader Ilana Eldridge came close to winning a seat, and their preferences had comparatively little effect on the outcome of any seats, let alone the election. The Network Against Prohibition ran in several seats, but did noticeably poorly. The Australian Democrats ran candidates in only two seats, a significant decrease from 2001, and barely rated at all. The Socialist Alliance chose not to run any candidates for financial reasons, instead endorsing the Green and NAP candidates.\n\nLaw and order has always been a prominent issue in the Northern Territory, and the Country Liberal Party campaigned on this heavily during their 27-year unbroken stint in government. Perhaps in acknowledgment of this, the Labor Party is also attempting to present itself as being harsh on antisocial behaviour. Mandatory sentencing is an issue in the background; there is some dispute as to its popularity in the Territory, and it is likely that a CLP government would reintroduce the policy, whereas it will almost definitely remain abolished under an ALP government.\n\nWhile there had been a form of unofficial campaign going on for some months, due to the persistent rumors of a coming election, there had been comparatively little in the way of policy announcements or major developments. Both parties began trading accusations that the other was being overly influenced by \"southerners\", with the ALP noting that the CLP had hired controversial federal Liberal staffer Ian Hanke and taking advantage of Burke's statements that he had had assistance from the federal Liberals in drafting his economic policies. At the same time, the CLP has been trying to link Martin's fortunes to those of less popular federal Labor leader Kim Beazley, and has suggested that she is being overly influenced by the federal party. (Where the CLP exists only in the Northern Territory, but is allied with the federal Liberals, the ALP is an entirely federal party.)\n\nThe CLP has also suffered due to a damaging row between Burke and former Shadow Minister Peter Maley, culminating in Maley's expulsion from the party on 19 May 2005. While Maley had once been touted as a potential leadership contender, he was later dumped from the ministry, and soon after announced his intention to retire at the 2005 election. Maley had reportedly not told Burke of his decision to retire before telling the media, and combined with his earlier axing, this aggravated tensions between the two. When the story broke on that Maley's wife had taken out a court order against him over domestic violence issues (although this was quickly withdrawn), Burke abruptly expelled Maley from the party. Maley served out the last weeks of his term as an independent, and briefly threatened to run for re-election, before deciding to publicly endorse the ALP candidate in his seat.\n\nWith the official announcement of the election on 30 May, the campaign began in earnest. Both parties made their first major policy launch on 1 June, with the ALP announcing plans to introduce laws cracking down on habitual drunks involved in antisocial behaviour, forcing them to undergo treatment or face jail, with a special alcohol court planned to deal with these offences. In contrast, the CLP concentrated on the economy, launching its \"Territory 2020\" plan to encourage business growth in the Territory, which amongst other things, would involve setting up a fund to encourage innovation and providing assistance to the armoured vehicle maintenance industry (Due to its location, Darwin, the Territory's capital, is a major defence hub, and defence industries are particularly important to the city's economy).\n\n\n\n\nSitting members are in bold. Successful candidates are highlighted in the relevant colour.\n\nTwo parties that did not hold registration with the Northern Territory Electoral Commission at the time of the election nevertheless endorsed candidates.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1967306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967306", "title": "Antilag system", "text": "Antilag system\n\nThe anti-lag system (ALS) is a method of reducing turbo lag or effective compression used on turbocharged engines to minimize turbo lag on racing or performance cars. It works by delaying the ignition timing very slightly to balance an inherent loss in combustion efficiency with increased pressure at the charging side of the turbo. This is achieved as a small amount of fuel/air mixture escapes through the exhaust valves and combusts in the hot exhaust manifold spooling the turbocharger creating higher usable pressure.\n\nALS was first used in the early days of turbocharged cars in Formula One racing circa mid to late 1980s, until fuel restrictions made its use unsuitable. Later it became a common feature in rally cars because of the increased turbo lag from the mandated restrictors at the intake manifold inlet. Due to the pressure drop across the restriction, the pressure ratio for a given boost level is much higher and the turbocharger must spin much faster to produce the same boost as when the engine operates without restriction. This increases turbo lag significantly compared to unrestricted turbochargers.\n\nAn ALS requires an air bypass, generally done in one of two ways. The first method is to use a throttle air bypass; this may be an external bypass valve or a solenoid valve which opens the throttle 12-20 degrees. This allows air to bypass the closed throttle and to reach the engine. The second method is to use a bypass valve that feeds charge air directly to the exhaust manifold.\n\nThe throttle bypass/throttle solenoid system is combined with ignition retardation and slight fuel enrichment (mainly to provide cooling), typically ignition occurs at 35-45° ATDC. This late ignition causes very little expansion of the gas in the cylinder; hence the pressure and temperature will still be very high when the exhaust valve opens. At the same time, the amount of torque delivered to the crankshaft will be very small (just enough to keep the engine running). The higher exhaust pressure and temperature combined with the increased mass flow is enough to keep the turbocharger spinning at high speed thus reducing lag. When the throttle is opened up again the ignition and fuel injection goes back to normal operation. Since many engine components are exposed to very high temperatures during ALS operation and also high-pressure pulses, this kind of system is very hard on the engine, turbocharger and exhaust manifold. For the latter not only the high temperatures are a problem but also the uncontrolled turbo speeds which can quickly destroy the turbocharger. In most applications the ALS is automatically shut down when the coolant reaches a temperature of 110–115 °C to prevent overheating.\n\nAn ALS working with a bypass valve that feeds air directly to nothing can be made more refined than the system described above. Some of the earliest systems of this type were used by Ferrari in F1. Another well-known application of this type of anti-lag system was in the WRC version of the 1995 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution III and Toyota Celica GT-Four (ST205). Brass tubes fed air from the turbocharger's Compressor Bypass Valve (CBV) to each of the exhaust manifold tracts, in order to provide the necessary air for the combustion of the fuel. The system was controlled by two pressure valves, operated by the ECU. Besides the racing version, the hardware of the anti-lag system was also installed in the 2500 \"Group A homologation base WRC method car\" street legal Celica GT-Fours. However, in these cars the system was disabled and inactive. The tubes and valves were only present for homologation reasons. On the Mitsubishi Evolution later series (Evolution IV-IX, JDM models only) the SAS (Secondary Air System) can be activated to provide anti-lag.\nMitsubishi Antilag system diagram \nSecondary air injection ALS \n\nA method by which a large one-way check valve is inserted just prior to the throttle body, enabling air to bypass the turbo, intercooler, and piping during periods where there is negative air pressure at the throttle body inlet. This results in more air combusting, which means more air driving the turbine side of the turbo. As soon as positive pressure is reached in the intercooler hosing, the valve closes.\n\nSometimes referred to as the Dan Culkin valve.\n\nWhen used in a MAF configuration, the D-valve should draw air through the MAF to maintain proper A/F ratios. This is not necessary in a speed-density configuration.\n\nMany programmable ECU's/ECU software (eCtune for example) also offer an \"anti-lag\" feature designed for spooling turbos off the line or between shifts. The end result is similar but the method of action is a bit different to the versions described above (which are far more common in high-level professional motorsports such as rally) and is more commonly used for launching & drag racing.\n\nWhen a car, ready for launch is being held at its launch RPM limit some ECUs (whether by switch or additional throttle) can be programmed to retard the ignition by quite a few degrees and add a lot more fuel. This causes the combustion event to happen much later, as the engine is driving the air/fuel mixture out of the cylinder, closer to the turbine, causing it to spool up either at an earlier RPM than it would normally – assuming the engine unloaded waiting for launch or make more boost at the launch RPM than it would without engaging this feature.\n\nSome software can also engage this \"fuel dump and ignition retard\" anti-lag method by clutch input (used with full-throttle shifting), effectively making it work between shifts. Like other types of anti-lag, overuse of this type of anti-lag can cause damage to the turbine wheel, manifold and more due to the violent pressures created when the air/fuel mixture spontaneously combusts from the heat of the turbine housing or is ignited by a very retarded ignition event (happening after the exhaust stroke begins) and can potentially cause popping/flames.\n\nThis form of \"anti-lag\" tends to work because the times it is active, the throttle is held at 100% allowing more air into the engine. Consequently, this type of anti-lag wouldn't work (well or at all) at part/closed throttle.\n\nModern Formula One power units are turbocharged, six cylinder engines in V formation, with an additional hybrid system. The hybrid system consists of two motor generator units, one Kinetic and a Heat. The MGU-H is used to eliminate turbo lag by essentially working as an electric motor that forces the turbine to rotate while the driver is off throttle, eliminating turbo lag almost completely. This is one of the most efficient methods of antilag, as the MGU-H also harvests heat energy while on the throttle and turns it into electrical energy, storing it in a battery.\n\nWorld Rally Championship cars use anti-lag systems which feed air directly to the exhaust system. The system works by bypassing charge air directly to the exhaust manifold which acts as a combustor when fuel rich exhaust from the engine meets up with the fresh air from the bypass. This will provide a continuous combustion limited to the exhaust manifold which significantly reduces the heat and pressure loads on the engine and turbocharger. With the latest anti-lag systems the bypass valve can not only be opened or closed but it can actually control the flow of air to the exhaust manifold very accurately. The turbocharger is fitted with a turbo speed sensor and the engine management system has a map based on throttle position and car speed which is used to find a suitable turbocharger speed and boost pressure for every condition. When the engine alone can't provide enough exhaust energy to reach the turbo speed/boost demanded by the management system, the bypass valve opens and exhaust manifold combustion begins. This not only reduces turbo load, but it also allows boost to be produced at very low engine speeds where boost was previously limited by compressor surge or exhaust energy. With relatively high boost at low speeds, this makes the low end torque superior even to large naturally aspirated engines. This kind of system has reached such a refinement that it is even possible to use the system in a road car. A recent example is the Prodrive P2 prototype.\n\n"}

Chalam discussed how he believed women should face these problems. The themes philosophical tinge of his writings blended with a distinctive style which would earn for him an enviable place in the Telugu literary world.\n\nChalam's writings have been an influence even to his contemporaries and are a growing influence among writers of this generation as well.\n\nMuch that is known about Chalam's childhood comes from his 1972 autobiography titled \"Chalam\". In it, he vividly mentions how he suffered beatings from his father and how his mother, residing at her parents’ home at {Tenali} even after having been married and starting a family with her husband,who actually belong to {valluripalem of Krishna district} had to face a flurry of insults. Chalam brazenly puts across why he wrote his autobiography in its foreword:\n\nKnown more widely as \"Chalam\"', Gudipati Venkata Chalam was born on 18 May 1894 in Krishna district in India. His mother was Venkata Subbamma and his father was Kommuri Sambasivarao. In his childhood, his maternal grandfather adopted him and his surname was changed to \"Gudipati\" from \"Kommuri\".So he was raised in Tenali. He used to practice Hindu rituals very religiously. Before he completing, he had committed himself to an exhaustive study of Hindu epics as well as Hindu doctrinal teachings. The way his father abused his mother made an indelible impression on his young mind. Besides this, the manner in which his sister \"Ammmanni\" (Venkata Ramanamma, Dulla) was coerced into an arranged marriage against her will also made him concentrate on the difficulties that women faced in society.\n\nChalam joined Pithapuram Maharaja College in 1911. At that time, he was attracted by the preachings of Raghupati Venkata Ratnam Naidu—a social reformer and founder of the Brahma Samaj in Andhra. Chalam went to Chennai to study for his Bachelor of Arts. Before joining the college, he was married to Chitti Ranganayakamma. While studying for his degree in Chennai, he got his wife admitted into a convent for her education and he used to drop her at school on his bicycle. This was a spectacle for the people to see -a husband dropping off the wife on his cycle. Chalam stopped wearing the sacred thread (Yagnopaveetham), started eating non-vegetarian food (Brahmins were strict vegetarians) and he used to mingle with all castes. This infuriated all his relatives and more so his father-in-law. His father-in-law banished him from entering his house. By that time, Chalam's wife's age was merely 13. When his mother-in-law died, Chalam and his friends were not allowed in his father-in-law's the house for the funeral, and they were served food outside.\n\nAfter completing his studies in Madras, Chalam joined in a job as tutor in Kakinada. Again, he started participating in the Brahma Samaj activities. He also became busy with his friendship with a beautiful girl named \"Ratnamma\" who happened to be his friend's sister-in-law. He worked as a teacher in Karimnagar. Then he joined in a job with Teacher's Training College in Rajahmundry. He later became a school inspector. About his job, Chalam wrote in his famous book \"Musings\" (in Telugu language) (Page 72, 5th Print in 2005) as follows:\n\nI am a stone, slave of the government, school inspector and for the poor mice like teachers, I am the cat.\n\nChalam's daughter,Souris, a devotee of Ramana Maharshi, maintains an ashram at Bheemili,Visakhapatnam.\n\nNovels\n\n\"Maidanam\", \"Sasirekha\", \"Dyvamicchina bharya\", \"Jeevitadarsam\", \"Brahmanikam\", 'Vivaham. \"'Aruna\", \"Anusuya' 'Ameena.'\n\nShort story collections\n\n\"Jealousy\", \"Aa rathri\", \"Prema paryavasanam\", \"Satyam Sivam Sundaram\", \"Vedantam\", Doshagunam, maadiga ammayi,maamagari \"\"maryada, mukkaalupeeta,mukthimaargam,mosamchesindha,yavvanavvanam,rasaputhrulu,raamabakthudu,raavanadarshanam,reddyrangamma,lancham,lakshimdevi,lakshmiuthharam, villytho snejam ela ayyindante?, vaani-a-study,vaallu naluguru, vichitranaleeyam, vithanthuvu, vennelathotalu, vendantham, vontarithanam, shamantakamanitho interview, sheshamma, saraswathee prasannam, cinema saayam, seethathalli, seethayya, sugandhi, susheela, stationpampu, hamko mohabbath, hampeekanyalu,hathya vicharana, harijana vidhyardhi, harijana samasya, hindhumusalmaan, nakshatrakaanthi, kamalaanehru samadhi vadda,anusooya...(many more to be updated reference from vishalandhra book house)\"\n\nNonfiction\n\n\"Musings\", \"Papam\", \"Prema Lekhalu\", \"Stree\", \"Biddala Shikshana\"\n\nChalam was a strong critic of the fundamental societal architecture of his time. He believed that the barriers created by the society precluded love and mutual understanding from human relationships.\n\nIn a society that believed in children being indebted to their parents, he proclaimed caring for and bringing up of children as the fundamental duty as parents.\n\nHe was widely shunned during his times especially for his advocacy of women's rights and his total rejection of the family system.\n\nHis Short story Doshagunam was adapted as a Telugu movie Grahanam.\n\n\"Stri oka mata valla,chupu vallaa purushuniki Spandichindaa...ika atani adhikaraniki,korikalaki,vinnapalaki antam undadu.

The stadium is the home of Valencia Club de Fútbol and has a capacity of 48,600 seats, making it the 7th-largest stadium in Spain, and the largest in the Valencian Community. The North Stand of the stadium is known for its very steep section.\n\nThe Estadio Mestalla was inaugurated with a friendly match on 20 May 1923 between Valencia CF and Levante UD. The new stadium had a capacity of 17,000 spectators, which was increased to 25,000 four years later. During the Civil War, the Mestalla was used as a concentration camp and storage warehouse. It would only keep its structure, since the rest was an empty plot of land with no terraces and a grandstand damaged during the war. \n\nDuring the 1950s, the Mestalla was renovated, resulting in a stadium with a seating capacity of 60,000 spectators. It was severely damaged by the flood of October 1957 when the Turia River broke its banks. The stadium soon returned to operational use with some more improvements, such as the addition of artificial lighting, and was inaugurated during the 1959 Fallas festivities.\n\nIn 1969, the stadium's name was changed to Estadio Luis Casanova, to honour club president Luis Casanova Giner. The change lasted for a quarter of a century, when Casanova admitted that he was completely overwhelmed by such an honour and requested in 1994 that the stadium's name be returned to Mestalla.\n\n1972 saw the inauguration of the club's head office, located in the back of the numbered terraces. It consisted of an office designed in the avant-garde style with a trophy hall, which held the flag the club was founded on. The summer of 1973 ushered in another change at Mestalla, the introduction of goal seats, which meant the elimination of fourteen rows of standing room terraces.\n\nA replacement stadium, Nou Mestalla, started construction in 2007, but is yet to be completed. The new stadium is due to have a capacity of 61,500.\n\nMestalla held the Spain national football team for the first time in 1925. It was chosen the national team's group venue when Spain staged the 1982 World Cup, and at the 1992 Summer Olympics held in Barcelona, all of Spain's matches up to the final were held at Mestalla, as they won Gold.\n\nMestalla has been the setting for important international matches, has held nine cup finals, has also been a temporary home for Levante UD, home of the Spanish national team and exile for Castellón and Real Madrid in the European Cup. Mestalla hosted the 2011 Copa del Rey Final between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid C.F., and the 2014 Copa del Rey Final between the same two teams. In total the stadium hosted ten Copa del Rey finals with the first one played in 1926. \n\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the 1982 FIFA World Cup (known as \"Luis Casanova Stadium\" at the time of the tournament), and held the following matches:\n\nMetro:\nAragón station (Lines 5 and 7) Metrovalencia\n\nFacultats station (Lines 3 and 9) Metrovalencia\n\nBus lines:\n\nAmadeo of Savoia street in: line 32.\n\nReyes Prosper street: line 71.\n\nAvenida de Aragón: lines 10, 12, 80, 41 and 79\n\nAvenida Blasco Ibáñez: lines 10, 29, 30, 31, 71, 79, 81, 89 and 90.\n\n"}

He married Elizabeth Field on October 10, 1778, and had one son. He built a simple home and workshop on Summer Street in 1786.\n\nStarting about 1780, McIntire was hired by Salem's pre-eminent merchant and America's first millionaire, Elias Hasket Derby, for whose extended family he built or remodeled a series of houses. McIntire taught himself the Palladian style of architecture from books, and soon had a reputation among the city's elite for designing elegant homes. In 1792, he entered a proposal in the competition for the United States Capitol.\n\nAfter 1797, McIntire worked in the style of Boston architect Charles Bulfinch, who had made fashionable here the McIntire Chair. The vase-back chair, originally part of a large set, was made for the wealthy Salem merchant Elias Hasket Derby. The chair's overall design is based on plate 2 of George Hepplewhite's Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Guide (London, 1788), but it has been enriched considerably by the addition of relief carving to parts of the back and the front legs. The carved grape clusters in the lunette at the base of the splat and suspended from bowknots at the top of each leg are a motif traditionally associated with the work of Salem's renowned architect and carver Samuel McIntire, who also was responsible for designing Elias Hasket Derby's spectacular Neoclassical mansion in Salem, completed in 1794. </ref> neoclassical manner of Scottish architect Robert Adam. Unlike Bulfinch, however, whose designs were featured across the East Coast, McIntire built almost exclusively in New England. His wooden or brick houses were typically 3 stories tall, each with 4 rooms around a central hall. In 1799, he went into business with his brothers, Joseph and Angier McIntire, who erected the structures, while at the workshop he oversaw various ornamentations, including the swags, rosettes, garlands and sheaves of wheat which dominate their interior wooden surfaces. McIntire's Salem works include the Peirce-Nichols, the Peabody-Silsbee, the Gardner-White-Pingree, and the Elias Haskett Derby residences. His public buildings, all in Salem, are Assembly Hall, Hamilton Hall, Washington Hall and the courthouse (the latter 2 demolished).\n\nHe was a skilled artisan, especially in furniture, and his skill extended to sculpting. Among his works are busts of Voltaire and John Winthrop, the first governor of Massachusetts. Both are now owned by the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nMcIntire's grave is in the Burying Point Cemetery, Salem, where his epitaph reads:\n\nIn 1981, Salem created the Samuel McIntire Historic District. Containing 407 buildings, it is the city's largest and this district is the location of the largest collection of homes from this colonial period in all of America. Samuel McIntire house and workshop was located on Summer Street, at the intersection of Chestnut Street where many grand mansions designed by Samuel McIntire display the profits of the Old China Trade these streets display the roots of the Colonial history of the United States in what is now the Samuel McIntire Historic District, which is considered to represent the greatest concentration of 17th and 18th century domestic structures anywhere in America. It includes McIntire commissions such as the Peirce-Nichols House and Hamilton Hall. The Witch House or Jonathan Corwin House (circa 1642) is also located in the District. Samuel McIntire's house was located at 31 Summer Street in what is now the Samuel McIntire Historic District.\n\nIn 2011, a mahogany side chair with carving attributed to Samuel McIntire sold at auction for $662,500, which set a world record for Federal furniture. The chair was one of a set of eight chairs originally purchased by Elias Hasket Derby, Salem's wealthiest merchant and thought to be America's first millionaire, and his wife, Elizabeth Crowninshield. The set was hand-made and hand-carved in the late 18th century.\n\nThe Samuel McIntire Historic District, established in 1981, incorporates two previously established districts, the Chestnut Street District (1971) and the Federal Street Area Historic District (1976), with the addition of some 249 structures on upper Essex, Broad, and Warren Streets, Dalton Parkway, and various cross and side streets in between.\n\nThe district is named for Salem's celebrated architect-carver, Samuel McIntire, who lived at 31 Summer Street. His first major commission, the Peirce-Nichols House (1782), and several of his mature works including Hamilton Hall (1805), are among the buildings preserved within the district.\n\nThis densely settled residential area of the city contains one of the greatest concentrations of notable pre-1900 domestic structures extant in the U.S. With few exceptions, the major architectural styles common to the region during the 1640-1940 period are represented. Of particular interest are the numerous Federal Era townhouses lining Chestnut Street. Collectively, they stand as a monument to the mercantile and maritime ascendancy of Salem in the latter 18th and early 19th centuries and constitute one of the most beautiful streetscapes in America.\n\nThe district also includes three churches, the Broad Street Burial Ground (1655) and Friends' Cemetery, several monuments, and the first Salem State Normal School Building (1854).\n\n"}
{"id": "1967320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967320", "title": "HMS Eagle (1918)", "text": "HMS Eagle (1918)\n\nHMS \"Eagle\" was an early aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy. Ordered by Chile during the South American dreadnought race as the \"Almirante Cochrane\", she was laid down before World War I. In early 1918 she was purchased by Britain for conversion to an aircraft carrier; this work was finished in 1924. Her completion was delayed by labour troubles and the possibility that she might be repurchased by Chile for reconversion into a battleship, as well as the need for comparative trials to determine the optimum layout for aircraft carriers. The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and then later to the China Station, spending very little time in home waters other than for periodic refits.\n\n\"Eagle\" spent the first nine months of World War II in the Indian Ocean searching for German commerce raiders. During the early part of the war, the Fleet Air Arm was desperately short of fighters and \"Eagle\" was equipped solely with Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers until late 1940. She was transferred to the Mediterranean in May 1940, where she escorted convoys to Malta and Greece and attacked Italian shipping, naval units and bases in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ship also participated in the Battle of Calabria in July but her aircraft failed to score any hits when they attempted to torpedo Italian cruisers during the battle. Whenever \"Eagle\" was not at sea, her aircraft were disembarked and used ashore.\n\nThe ship was relieved by a more modern carrier in March 1941 and ordered to hunt for Axis shipping in the Indian Ocean and the South Atlantic. Her aircraft sank a German blockade runner and disabled a German oil tanker in mid-1941 but did not find any other Axis ships before the ship was ordered home for a refit in October. After completing an extensive refit in early 1942, the ship made trips delivering fighter aircraft to Malta to boost its air defences in the first half of 1942. \"Eagle\" was torpedoed and sunk by the on 11 August 1942 while escorting a convoy to Malta during Operation Pedestal.\n\nIn 1911, the Chilean Navy ordered one super-dreadnought battleship, with an option for a second ship, each to be armed with ten 14-inch (356 mm) and sixteen six-inch (152 mm) guns, that were named and \"Almirante Cochrane\". \"Almirante Latorre\" was laid down in December 1911, followed by \"Almirante Cochrane\" at the Armstrong yards at Newcastle upon Tyne on 20 February 1913. On the outbreak of the First World War, construction of the two ships was suspended. As \"Almirante Latorre\" was almost complete, she was purchased for the Royal Navy, entering service as in 1915. \"Almirante Cochrane\" was almost complete up to the forecastle, although her side armour had not yet been installed when war broke out. No work was carried out during the war until the British decided to complete her as an aircraft carrier for the Royal Navy. She was therefore purchased from Chile on 28 February 1918 to be converted into the carrier HMS \"Eagle\". She was the fourteenth ship of the Royal Navy to bear that name.\n\nThe Director of Naval Construction began preliminary design work even before the ship was purchased and submitted an outline design on 8 February 1918. This design had a full-length flight deck and its most distinctive features were the two islands separated by the flight deck. Each island was to be long, containing two funnels and a tripod mast. Although they were staggered to make it more difficult for an enemy ship to estimate the ship's course, they were to be connected to each other with heavy bracing. The bridge was to be mounted on top of this bracing which left a clear height of for the aircraft on the flight deck. There was to be a wide space between the islands where the aircraft were to be assembled before taking off. Aircraft would be transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts (elevators). A crane was to be located at the aft end of each island to lift aircraft aboard and to recover seaplanes. Bulk petrol storage consisted of in tins stowed on the forecastle deck and protected by plating. Two ready-use tanks near the islands would allow aircraft on the flight deck to refuel. The ship's planned armament consisted of nine 6-inch guns and four anti-aircraft guns mounted on the platform between the islands. \"Eagle\" retained the battleship's mixture of coal and fuel oil, but the quantities were increased to of coal and of oil, as the forward and rear 14-inch magazines and shell rooms were converted to be used as oil tanks.\nBased on trials with , in which pilots were found generally to turn to port when recovering from an aborted landing, the design was revised to eliminate the port island in April 1918. The starboard island was lengthened to and its width was reduced to to minimise air turbulence. The island contained the bridge, both funnels and the tripod mast that carried the fire-control directors for the armament. At the request of Admiral David Beatty, commander of the Grand Fleet, the main armament was increased to 12 six-inch guns, including one mounted on the island, and eighteen torpedo tubes were added, three triple fixed mounts on each broadside, in case the ship met German light cruisers at night. The anti-aircraft armament was reduced to a single 4-inch gun mounted on the island between the funnels as Beatty believed that the ship's own fighters would be her best defence against enemy aircraft. This design was approved in June, although work had begun earlier.\n\nThe armour planned for her upper belt was used to protect the ship's waterline. The already-completed superstructure was removed as were the barbettes for the 14-inch guns. \"Eagle\" was launched on 8 June 1918 and was towed downriver to the shipbuilder's High Walker yard for fitting-out ten days later. The boiler uptakes were re-routed and the existing openings were plated over. The existing upper deck became the floor of the hangar deck and a new superstructure was built above it. The flight deck was thick and served as the uppermost strength deck, or main supporting deck, of the ship. When the war ended in November 1918, the ship was about nine months from completion.\n\nConstruction was slowed by industrial action after the war, and was suspended on 21 October 1919 as Chile wanted to repurchase the ship and have it re-converted to a battleship. The £2.5 million cost of doing so would have been higher than the £1.5 million offered by the Chileans and the Admiralty decided to retain the ship. The Royal Navy needed to carry out flying trials with a carrier fitted with an island, and the Admiralty approved the use of \"Eagle\" on 11 November. Armstrong Whitworth plated over the openings for the undelivered elevators on the flight deck (which had been cancelled when they could not meet the specifications), finished the rear funnel, removed the torpedo tubes, and plated over the forward funnel uptakes before she sailed to the Royal dockyard at Portsmouth for the modifications necessary for the trials on 20 April 1920. Only two of her boilers, converted to run on fuel oil only, could be used during the trials.\n\nThe trials principally tested the longitudinal arresting gear used previously on the small aircraft carrier . They were not intended to stop landing aircraft—the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind—but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and falling off the flight deck. Initially, the arresting gear was about long and was installed too far forward. Over the course of the trials it was moved further to the rear and lengthened to a total of .\n\nThe ship was commanded during the trials by Captain Wilmot Nicholson, who had previously commanded the carrier in 1918, and the Royal Air Force representative was Group Captain Charles Samson. Taxiing trials began on 10 May with Sopwith Camel fighters and Parnall Panther reconnaissance aircraft while the ship was still docked. Flights over and around the ship to evaluate air currents over the flight deck and around the island began shortly afterward and the first on-board landing was made on 1 June. Larger aircraft like the Bristol F2B fighter, the Sopwith Cuckoo torpedo bomber, and the De Havilland DH.9 bomber were also evaluated during the trials. They were generally successful with only 12 minor accidents in 143 landings in all types of weather conditions, although they did reveal that aircraft landing aboard carriers would need landing gear fitted with shock absorbers to handle the impact of landing on a pitching deck. Group Captain Samson strongly preferred the elimination of the island entirely, but Nicholson recommended that the ship be retained for service, although he was not satisfied with the size and shape of the island. He also recommended that \"Eagle\" be converted to burn fuel oil exclusively and that the removal of the 6-inch guns in exchange for anti-aircraft guns would allow the tripod mast in the island to be eliminated, since it would not then be required for fire control purposes .\n\nThe ship was paid off on 16 November, but did not begin construction to a revised design until 24 March 1921 at Portsmouth. The Admiralty accepted some of Nicholson's suggestions, but not all. The shape and size of the island was modified in accordance with the results from wind tunnel testing at the National Physical Laboratory, but the 6-inch guns were retained. The forward edge of the flight deck was faired into the ship's bow to smooth out the air currents over the bow and the 4-inch anti-aircraft guns were mounted on and around the island. The forward elevator was moved to the forward end of the hangar. After construction began, anti-torpedo bulges were added, deep, and the petrol tin storage room was replaced by a tank. The ship's designed fuel capacity was , but this was increased to when she was bulged. However, of this amount was required to act as ballast to offset the weight of the island and its equipment.\n\n\"Eagle\" had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at standard load. Each of the ship's four sets of Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines drove one 3-bladed propeller. They were powered by 32 Yarrow small-tube boilers. During her sea trials on 9–10 September 1923, the turbines produced and gave \"Eagle\" a speed of , but this caused leaks in the turbine joints and she was limited to a maximum of in service. She had a range of at .\n\nThe ship's flight deck was long and her hangar was long and than wide. Its minimum height was , and it was equipped with four steel shutter fire curtains to isolate any fires in the hangar. The forward lift's dimensions were and the aft lift was . The fore-and-aft arresting gear was long and extended the length of the flight deck between the edges of the lifts. A large crane with a radius was positioned behind the island. The ship's aircraft capacity was 25 to 30 and, in 1939, the ship's crew totalled 41 officers and 750 men, exclusive of the air group.\n\nFor self-defence against enemy warships, \"Eagle\" had nine BL Mk XVII 6-inch guns, three at the stern and six along both sides of the ship. The ship carried 200 rounds per gun. Two of her five QF Mk V 4-inch AA guns were positioned on the flight deck in front of the island while a third was behind the island. The remaining two guns were mounted on top of the island, one between the two funnels, and each gun was provided with 150 rounds.\n\n\"Eagle\" was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet on 7 June 1924 after she commissioned on 26 February and finished working up. She was the largest aircraft carrier in the world at the time and embarked 24 aircraft in four six-aircraft flights of the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force. These consisted of No. 402 Flight with Fairey Flycatchers, No. 422 Flight with Blackburn Blackburn reconnaissance aircraft, No. 440 Flight (Supermarine Seagull flying boats) and No. 460 Flight with Blackburn Dart torpedo bombers.\n\nWhile in the Mediterranean, one flight usually operated ashore at either RAF Hal Far, Malta, or Aboukir, Egypt. The Seagulls proved to be unsatisfactory in service and they were replaced by Fairey IIIDs in January 1925. Avro Bison spotters of No. 421B Flight operated aboard for a time in late 1925. \"Eagle\" sailed for Devonport at the end of 1925 for a brief refit where the longitudinal arresting gear was removed as it had been found to be virtually useless in service. Two single QF 2-pounder \"pom-pom\" light anti-aircraft guns were added forward of the 4-inch guns on the flight deck in front of the island and the ship's petrol capacity was increased to .\n\nWhen the ship returned to the Mediterranean after the completion of her refit in 1926, the Bisons of No. 448 Flight replaced No. 422 Flight. In 1928 she was joined by which allowed the fleet to experiment with multi-carrier operations. \"Eagle\" was refitted again in early 1929 and a salt-water spray system was fitted to fight hangar fires. On 29 June 1929, she rescued Spanish Air Force Major Ramón Franco – brother of future Spanish dictator Francisco Franco – and his crew, who had been adrift in the North Atlantic Ocean since 22 June when their flying boat, the Dornier Do J Wal (\"Whale\") \"Numancia\" was forced down due to fuel exhaustion on the first leg of an attempt to fly westward around the world.\n\nWhen \"Eagle\" returned to the Mediterranean later in the year, both 440 and 448 Flights had re-equipped with Fairey IIIF reconnaissance aircraft. \"Eagle\" departed Malta on 8 January 1931, en route to Portsmouth to load the latest carrier aircraft for a demonstration at the British Industries Exhibition at Buenos Aires, Argentina. She returned to the Mediterranean to participate in the summer fleet exercises before sailing for Devonport where she began a lengthy refit in August.\n\nThe ship's boilers were replaced during the refit and the 4-inch gun between the funnels was replaced by an eight-barrel QF 2-pounder Mark V \"pom-pom\" mount. A single quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mount was added on the starboard aft side of the flight deck. Four fire-fighting foam generators were also fitted on the flight deck. A single High Angle Control System (HACS) director was fitted on the aft end of the control top on the tripod mast. The crew, now numbering 753 sailors and 253 airmen, benefited from improved accommodation. The refit was completed on 28 November 1932, but personnel shortages prevented her from working up until April 1933.\nFollowing the refit, \"Eagle\" was sent to the Far East, serving on the China Station throughout 1934, with her aircraft being deployed against pirate ships and their bases. The tropical heat caused problems in cooling the bomb magazines, and the food storage rooms and the ventilation proved to be barely satisfactory. Another quadruple .50 machine gun mount was added forward of the 2-pounder gun on the flight deck and the original mounting was shifted over to the port side. During this time, the ship's air group comprised nine Hawker Osprey fighters of 803 Squadron and 12 Fairey IIIFs of 824 Squadron; the latter unit was re-designated as 825 Squadron in October 1934. 803 Squadron transferred to when she relieved \"Eagle\" at the end of 1934. They were replaced by Blackburn Baffin torpedo bombers of 812 Squadron when \"Eagle\" arrived in the Mediterranean in February 1935. Both squadrons remained behind at RAF Hal Far when the ship sailed for Devonport for another refit in June.\n\n\"Eagle\" was paid off until her refit began in early 1936. Transverse arresting gear was installed and a second octuple \"pom-pom\" replaced the 2-pounders in front of the island. Two more quadruple .50 machine gun mounts were installed in sponsons on either side of the bow. The capacity of her bomb magazines was also increased during this refit, and the ship's ventilation and insulation arrangements were improved as well. She was sent back to the Far East in 1937 with only nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers (cloth-covered biplanes) of 813 Squadron aboard as well as nine more Swordfish to re-equip 824 Squadron when it transferred from \"Hermes\" in April. Captain Clement Moody commanded \"Eagle\" from 1 January 1937 until relieved by Captain A. R. M. Bridge on 16 June 1939. In August 1939 the ship's crew was exchanged in Hong Kong and \"Eagle\" sailed for Singapore to begin a short refit on 12 August.\n\nWhen World War Two began the following month, the ship had just completed her refit in Singapore. She put to sea a few days later and began searching for German merchant ships in company with the light cruiser and escorted by the destroyer . A Swordfish discovered the freighter south of the port of Padang on Sumatra and \"Birmingham\" was ordered to intercept it while \"Eagle\" continued her air patrols. She arrived in Colombo, Ceylon, on 10 September and until 5 October she searched the Indian Ocean for German ships between the west coast of India and the Maldive Islands with the light cruiser . \"Eagle\" was then assigned to Force I together with the heavy cruisers and , to search the Indian Ocean for the pocket battleship and other German commerce raiders. In mid-December her boilers and bottom were cleaned during a period of maintenance in Durban, South Africa.\n\"Eagle\" continued to patrol the Indian Ocean in 1940, but escorted a large Australian troop convoy to Suez early in the year. While in the vicinity of the Nicobar Islands on 14 March, a bomb accidentally exploded, killing 14 men. The damage to the ship was mostly confined to the bomb magazines, although two generators were knocked out. The explosion flashed upwards through the port bomb lift and ignited the wing on one Swordfish stowed in the hangar. All but four of the aircraft were damaged by the corrosive salt-water spray system when the fire was doused. She was repaired at Singapore between 15 March and 9 May when the ship sailed for Colombo en route to the Mediterranean, which she reached on 26 May. In June three crated Gloster Sea Gladiators were found in storage at Dekheila and these aircraft became the only fighters available for the entire fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nFlying from shore bases on 5 July, 813 Squadron attacked Tobruk harbour in a combined attack with the RAF at dusk, sinking the and the freighter , and blowing the bow off the destroyer . Two other merchantmen had to be beached before they sank. During the Battle of Calabria on 9 July, 813 Squadron was used to search and track the Italian fleet while 824 Squadron made two unsuccessful attacks on Italian cruisers without loss. On the evening of 10 July, \"Eagle\"s aircraft attacked Augusta harbour in Sicily, sinking the destroyer . While under heavy aerial attack on 13 July, pilots of the Sea Gladiator Flight shot down three Italian bombers. On the night of 20 July, six aircraft from 824 Squadron, flying from Sidi Barrani, sank the destroyers and as well as the freighter . While providing distant cover to a convoy bound for Greece, one Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 medium bomber was shot down on 29 July by \"Eagle\"s Sea Gladiators while attacking the fleet.\n\nOn 22 August three Swordfish from 824 Squadron, flying from Sidi Barrani, attacked and sank the and the depot ship \"Monte Gargano\" in the Gulf of Bomba. The ships were carrying eight frogmen and four manned torpedoes to attack British shipping in Alexandria harbour. In September, she was joined by the carrier and both ships attacked Italian airbases on Rhodes on 9 September. \"Eagle\"s 12 Swordfish were late in taking off and attacked the airfield at Maritza after the Italians had been alerted by the earlier attack by \"Illustrious\" aircraft on the nearby airbase at Collato. Four aircraft were shot down by the defending Fiat CR.32 and Fiat CR.42 fighters, but two SM.79s were destroyed on the ground and four other aircraft were damaged. These losses were the ship's heaviest in any single mission of the war.\n\nWhile covering another convoy to Malta on 12 October, she was damaged by near misses from SM.79s based in Sicily. The damage to her aviation fuel system was not immediately apparent and she covered another convoy later that month. While returning to Alexandria, her aircraft attacked Maltezana seaplane base on Rhodes on 27 October. Four of her Swordfish from 824 Squadron had been disembarked earlier and were flown to Fuka Landing Ground for a night attack on Tobruk harbour. The 824 Squadron aircraft distracted the defences with 250-pound bombs, while the 12 other Swordfish laid mines. On 28 October, \"Eagle\" and the rest of the Mediterranean Fleet patrolled off the west coast of Greece for a few days hoping to intercept the Italian Navy if it supported the Italian Army in their invasion of Greece, but no contact was made.\n\nWhen the ship was examined on 5 November, her aviation fuel system was leaking and required repairs. Five of her aircraft were transferred to \"Illustrious\" for an attack on 11 November on Taranto (Operation Judgement), whilst \"Eagle\" remained in Alexandria. One of \"Eagle\"s Swordfish was shot down by the intense Italian anti-aircraft fire. The ship covered multiple convoys to Greece and Malta during the rest of November. Six of her aircraft bombed Tripoli harbour during the night of 24/25 November without loss. \"Eagle\" spent most of December in Alexandria, but her aircraft supported the ground war, most notably when they spotted for the battleships and during the bombardment of Bardia on 2 January 1941. In mid-January, the ship covered a convoy to Greece, but bad weather foiled plans to attack Italian bases en route. After her return, her aircraft complement was reorganised to include more fighters, as \"Eagle\" now had sole responsibility for fighter cover over the fleet after the crippling of \"Illustrious\" by German dive bombers on 11 January. In order to make room for the fighters, one of the Swordfish squadrons was disembarked and used to support the ground war. When \"Eagle\" was covering another convoy to Malta in mid-February, the ship carried nine Fairey Fulmars of 805 Squadron, five Sea Gladiators and six Swordfish.\n\nAfter the carrier arrived on 9 March to relieve \"Illustrious\", orders were cancelled that would have transferred Eagle to the South Atlantic to hunt for German commerce raiders and the ship did not leave Alexandria until 9 April. In the meantime, both Swordfish squadrons were transferred to Port Sudan to operate against Italian shipping in Massawa, in Italian East Africa, on 25 March. They were very successful and returned to the ship on 13 April after she had passed through the Suez Canal. After she reached Mombasa, Kenya, on 26 April, she was ordered to sea on 29 April on an unsuccessful search for a raider in the Indian Ocean. The ship was then ordered on 1 May to proceed to Durban, South Africa, to rendezvous with the battleship and to proceed to Gibraltar. After the two ships arrived in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 25 May to refuel, \"Nelson\" was ordered to continue to Gibraltar, but \"Eagle\"s orders changed and she was now charged with hunting for German supply ships in the South Atlantic. Captain A. R. M. Bridge was relieved by E. G. H. Rushbrooke at this time.\n\n\"Eagle\" began searching the South Atlantic on 29 May, usually accompanied by \"Dorsetshire\" or the light cruiser . The carrier's Swordfish discovered, bombed and sank the blockade runner \"Elbe\" on 6 June. The oil tanker \"Lothringen\" was captured on 15 June by \"Dunedin\" after it had been bombed and strafed by several Swordfish. The ship continued patrolling without incident except for a hangar fire that killed one aircraft mechanic on 20 September. All but four of the ship's Swordfish were damaged by the spray used to put out the fire, but the ship herself was undamaged.\n\nIn October 1941, \"Eagle\" was ordered to return to Britain for a refit at Gladstone Dock, Liverpool. She arrived off Greenock on 26 October and was docked at Liverpool on 1 November. The quadruple .50 machine guns were replaced by 12 manually operated automatic 20 mm Oerlikon light anti-aircraft guns, six in sponsons on each side of the flight deck, and the crews of the four-inch AA guns were given protection from splinters by the addition of zarebas around each weapon. The HACS was moved to the front of the control top and fitted with a Type 285 gunnery radar. A Type 290 air warning radar was also installed. The ship's oil fuel capacity was reduced to in exchange for an increase in her petrol storage of . This reduced her range to at a speed of .\n\n\"Eagle\"s refit was completed on 9 January 1942 and she was working up for the next five weeks. She joined the convoy WS16 en route to Gibraltar on 16 February and reached it a week later. 813 and 824 Squadrons had rejoined the ship with their Swordfish and they were supplemented by four Sea Hurricane 1B fighters from a detachment of 804 Squadron and the Fighter Flight of 813 Squadron. Because their wings could not fold, they could not use either lift and remained on the flight deck at all times. The ship reached Gibraltar on 23 February and was assigned to Force H.\n\nUpon \"Eagle\"'s arrival in Gibraltar, 824 Squadron transferred to RAF North Front and the ship loaded 15 Supermarine Spitfire fighters brought to Gibraltar by the carrier . These aircraft were partly assembled dockside and hoisted aboard for final assembly. They were too big to fit below deck and remained on the flight deck, where they impeded the operations of \"Eagle\"s aircraft, except for those few also carried on the flight deck, until the ferried aircraft were flown off. On 27 February 1942, she sailed to deliver the Spitfires to Malta, escorted by the battleship , \"Argus\", the cruiser , and nine destroyers, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. The problems were not rectified until 7 March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off to Malta. Upon her return, the ship's engines required repairs that lasted until 13 March. Nine more Spitfires were delivered to Malta on 21 March and an additional seven on 29 March. After her return, her steering gear required extensive repairs that lasted until the end of April.\nAs part of Operation Bowery, \"Eagle\" rendezvoused on the night of 7/8 May with the American carrier , carrying 47 Spitfires, while \"Eagle\" had landed her entire aircraft complement to make room for 17 Spitfires of her own. Sixty of them arrived safely at Malta. For the next operation on 17 May, the Swordfish and Sea Hurricanes of 813 Squadron flew back on board to join the 17 Spitfires and six Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers destined for Malta. The fighters flew off without incident, but engine problems forced all of the Albacores to return. After they had landed, the ship was attacked by a half-dozen SM.79 torpedo bombers which failed to score any hits. The radar-guided guns of the escorting light cruiser, , were instrumental in driving off the determined Italian aircraft.\n\n\"Eagle\" disembarked all of her aircraft, except for her four Sea Hurricanes, to make room for 31 Spitfires and flew them off on 3 June during Operation Style. Another 32 were flown off on 9 June during Operation Salient. Later in the month, the ship provided air cover for another convoy, Operation Harpoon, which departed for Malta at the same time as the Operation Vigorous convoy did, from the opposite direction. A dozen Sea Hurricanes of 801 Squadron and four Fulmars from 807 Squadron reinforced the four Sea Hurricanes of 813's Fighter Flight to deal with the heavy air attacks anticipated. The convoy was subject to heavy air attacks by both the German and Italian Air Forces; \"Eagle\"s Sea Hurricanes managed to disrupt many attacks, claiming nine aircraft destroyed and a further two probably destroyed for the loss of one Sea Hurricane from 813 Squadron and three Fulmars. The escorts reached Gibraltar on 17 June and did not make the next delivery of aircraft until 14 July when 32 Spitfires were flown off to Malta (Operation Pinpoint). During this time, the carrier's aircraft complement consisted solely of six Sea Hurricanes of 801 Squadron. Another 29 Spitfires as well as four Swordfish of 824 Squadron were loaded on 20 July and the Spitfires were flown off the following day. Earlier in the day, the ship was unsuccessfully attacked by the .\n\n\"Eagle\" covered Operation Pedestal together with the carriers and . \"Eagle\" carried 16 Sea Hurricanes of 801 and 813 Squadrons as well as four reserve aircraft for the operation. On the early afternoon of 11 August, \"Eagle\" was hit by four torpedoes from the , commanded by Helmut Rosenbaum, and sank within four minutes, south of Cape Salinas at position . Losses in the sinking included 131 officers and ratings, mainly from the ship's propulsion machinery spaces. Four Sea Hurricanes from 801 were aloft when the ship was torpedoed, and they landed on other carriers; the remaining sixteen went down with the ship. The destroyers and and the tug \"Jaunty\" rescued 67 officers and 862 sailors.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1967332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967332", "title": "Gurazada Apparao", "text": "Gurazada Apparao\n\nGurajada Venkata Apparao (21 September 1862 – 30 November 1915) was a noted Indian playwright, dramatist, poet, and writer known for his works in Telugu theatre. Rao wrote the play \"Kanyasulkam\" in 1892, which is often considered the greatest play in the Telugu language. One of the pioneers of Indian theatre, Rao holds the titles \"Kavisekhara\" and \"Abyudaya Kavitha Pithamahudu\". In 1910, Rao scripted the widely known Telugu patriotic song \"Desamunu Preminchumanna\".\n\nIn 1897, Kanyasulkam was published (by Vavilla Ramaswamy Sastrulu and Sons, Madras) and dedicated to Maharaja Ananda Gajapati. Apparao (along with his brother Syamala Rao) wrote several English poems. His Sarangadhara, published in \"Indian Leisure Hour\", was well received. The editor of the Calcutta-based \"Rees and Ryot\", Sambhu Chandra Mukherji read it and re-published it in his magazine. \"Gundukurti Venkata Ramanayya\", editor of the \"Indian Leisure Hour\", encouraged Apparao greatly during the same period. In 1891, Gurajada was appointed to the post of Epigraphist to the Maharaja of Vizianagaram.\n\nGurajada was born on 21 September 1862 at his maternal uncle's home in Rayavaram village, near Yelamanchili, Visakhapatnam district into a Brahmin family. His parents were Venkata Rama Dasu and Kausalyamma. Gurajada lived most of his life in and around Vizianagaram in what was then called as Kalinga Rajyam. He and his father before him were both employed by the princely state of Vizianagaram. Gurajada enjoyed a close relationship with the ruling family during his adult life. He had his initial schooling in Cheepurupalli while his father was working there. His remaining schooling was done at Vizianagaram after his father died. During that time, he was taken care of by the then M.R. College Principal, C. Chandrasekhara Sastri who provided him free lodging and boarding. He completed his matriculation in 1882 and obtained F.A. in 1884. Soon after, he was employed as a teacher in M.R. High School in 1884 with a salary of Rs.25.\n\nIn 1887, Gurajada spoke at a Congress Party meeting in Vizianagaram. His daughter Voleti Lakshmi Narasamma was born in 1887. He was simultaneously involved in social work and became a member of the Voluntary Service Corps in Visakhapatnam in 1888. He was elected vice-president of the Ananda Gajapati Debating club in 1889. His son Gurajada Venkata Ramadasu was born in 1890. In 1891 he was promoted to Lecturer (Level III) with a salary of Rs.125. He taught the F.A. and B.A. classes several subjects including English Grammar, Sanskrit Literature, Translation, Greek and Roman Histories. His younger brother Syamala Rao died in 1892 while studying at Madras Law College.\n\nIn 1911, he was appointed to the Board of Studies by Madras University. The same year, Gurajada and his friends started the \"Andhra Sahitya Parishat\" to promote use of spoken dialects. The next year, he was invited to attend the meeting of the Bangeeya Sahitya Parishat (Bengal Literary Association) at Calcutta.\n\nGurajada retired in 1913, and the then Madras University honored him with the title \"Emeritus Fellow\". He died on 30 November 1915.\n\n\"Kanyasulkam\" is about the deplorable condition of widows in traditional Brahmin families in the Andhra region of India during the 19th century. The play is a highly thought-provoking social drama dealing with social issues relevant to the time. Gurajada Apparao was deeply troubled by the double standards, hypocrisy and social inequalities in the Indian society. The English preface to the first edition of his play states: \"Such a scandalous state of things is a disgrace to society, and literature can not have a higher function than to show up such practices and give currency to a high standard of moral ideas. Until reading habits prevail among masses, one must look only to the stage to exert such healthy influence.\"\n\nPerhaps for the first time in Telugu literary history, a prostitute was given a very positive image so much so that she is shown to better the lives of many people during the course of the play. The play is ageless in the sense that its projection of the Indian mindset and psyche is very relevant and applicable in Indian Society today. The play was, in some ways, ahead of its time and was very bold in criticizing the popular opinions and practices during that era. It frequently jabs at the male-dominated society of India, by bringing to the forefront certain egoistic idiosyncrasies of a typical Indian male, in an unflattering manner. It also questions the practices of witchcraft, sorcery, and their popular usage in medical practice during that period in India.\n\nGurajada married Appala Narasamma in 1885. He continued his studies and graduated with B.A. (Philosophy major and Sanskrit minor) in 1886. For some period during 1886, he worked as Head Clerk in the Deputy Collector's office. On Vijayadasami day, 1887, he joined as a Lecturer (Level IV) in \"M.R. College\" with a salary of Rs.100. Around the same time, he was introduced to Maharajah Pusapati Ananda Gajapati Raju (1850–1897).\n\nIn 1905, Gurajada's mother died. In 1906, his close friend P.T. Srinivasa Iyyangar, principal of Mrs. A.V.N. College, Visakhapatnam started an association to promote curriculum reform in high schools. One of the chief aims was to introduce spoken dialects. Along with him, J.A. Yates (1874–1951) -a British civil servant, Gidugu and Gurajada were the principal members. Another friend S. Srinivasa Iyengar (1874–1941) also gave a lot of support and encouragement. Incidentally, this Srinivasa Iyengar was a well-known lawyer and was the President of AICC (All India Congress Committee) annual session at Guwahati in 1926. Gurajada's childhood friend and classmate in Chipurupalli, Gidugu Rammurty (1863–1940) was his school of thought.\n\n"}

The album came after recording three experimental releases with John Lennon and a live album as a member of The Plastic Ono Band.\n\nWith the exception of \"AOS\", a 1968 recording, the entire album was recorded in one afternoon in October 1970 during the \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" sessions at Ascot Sound Studios and Abbey Road Studios, using the same musicians and production team. Also recorded on this day were \"Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\" which ended up on the next album \"Fly\", and \"Between the Takes\" which was released on \"Fly\"'s 1998 CD reissue. \"Greenfield Morning I Pushed an Empty Baby Carriage All Over the City\" was based around a sample from a discarded tape of George Harrison playing a sitar and a Ringo Starr drum break with an added echo effect plus Ono's vocals with a lyric referencing a miscarriage. Ono's vocalisations on tracks such as \"Why\" and \"Why Not\" mixed \"hetai\", a Japanese vocal technique from kabuki theatre, with modern rock 'n roll and raw aggression influenced by the then-popular primal therapy that Lennon and Ono had been undertaking. According to Ono, the recording engineers were in the habit of turning off the recording equipment when she began to perform-- which is why, at the end of \"Why\", Lennon can be heard asking \"Were you gettin' that?\".\n\n\"AOS\" was recorded on 29 February 1968. On this day, Yoko Ono appeared onstage at London's Royal Albert Hall with jazz musician Ornette Coleman and his bandmates - basists Charlie Haden and David Izenzon and drummer Ed Blackwell. The performance and their afternoon rehearsal were both recorded (\"AOS\" was recorded during the rehearsal). Describing how she met Coleman, Ono has stated:Ornette was already very, very established and famous and respected guy as a musician. And I met him in Paris. The way I met was, I was doing a show and after the show, somebody said, Oh, Ornette Coleman is here and he would like to – okay. Well, hello. Thank you for coming. That kind of thing. And he was saying, Well, okay. So he said that he was going to go and do a concert in Albert Hall and would I come and do it with him because he thought it was kind of interesting what I do.\n\nInitially on Apple Records, through EMI, \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" was released to considerable critical disdain in 1970, at a time when Ono was being widely blamed for disbanding The Beatles. \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" failed to chart in the UK, but reached number 182 in the US. Notable exceptions were the estimations of \"Billboard\" who called it 'visionary' and critic Lester Bangs who supported it in \"Rolling Stone\". More recently, the album has been credited with having an influence on musicians grossly disproportionate to its sales and visibility (like those of The Velvet Underground). David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" has credited the album with \"launching a hundred or more female alternative rockers, like Kate Pierson & Cindy Wilson of the B-52s to current thrashers like L7 and Courtney Love of Hole\".\n\nThe covers of \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" and \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" albums are nearly identical; Lennon pointed out the difference in their 1980 \"Playboy\" interview (\"In Yoko's, she's leaning back on me; in mine, I'm leaning on her\"). The photos were taken with a cheap Instamatic camera on the grounds of Tittenhurst Park (their home at the time) by actor Daniel Richter—best known for playing Moon-Watcher, the head apeman of Stanley Kubrick's science fiction film \"\". At the time, Richter lived with Lennon and Ono and worked as their assistant.\n\nThe album was reissued on CD by Rykodisc in 1997 with three bonus tracks from the era (\"Open Your Box\", \"Something More Abstract\" and \"The South Wind\") and an \"LP replica\" special edition was issued by V2 Records in Japan in 2007.\n\nThe album was reissued on LP, CD, and digitally by Secretly Canadian on November 11th, 2016 with bonus tracks and rare photos.\n\nAll songs written by Yoko Ono.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This was expanded to ten boroughs in 1868. The Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 extended the area of parliamentary boroughs to the Metropolitan Board of Works area.\n\nA cell marked → (with a different colour background to the preceding cell) indicates that the previous MP continued to sit under a new party name.\n\nDespite Greater London being created in 1965 the old constituency boundaries remained in place until 1974.\n\nWhen Greater London was created in 1965 the existing constituencies crossed county boundaries. The constituency review reported in 1969, and was implemented for the February 1974 election. All 92 constituencies were contained within Greater London and each were within a single London borough, with the exception of the City of London and Westminster South. They were all borough constituencies. The constituencies were also used as electoral divisions for the Greater London Council from 1973 to 1986.\n\nThe constituencies were redrawn for the 1983 election. All 84 constituencies were contained within Greater London and each were within a single London borough, with the exception of the City of London and Westminster South. They were all borough constituencies.\n\nThe constituencies were redrawn for the 1997 election. All 74 constituencies were contained within Greater London. Constituencies crossed borough boundaries between Bexley and Greenwich; Ealing, and Hammersmith and Fulham; Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster and the City of London; Kingston upon Thames and Richmond upon Thames; Lambeth and Southwark; Newham and Tower Hamlets; and Redbridge and Waltham Forest. They were all borough constituencies.\n\nThe constituencies were redrawn for the 2010 election. All 73 constituencies are contained within Greater London. Constituencies cross borough boundaries between Barking and Dagenham, and Havering; Brent and Camden; Harrow and Hillingdon; Kensington and Chelsea, and Hammersmith and Fulham; Redbridge and Waltham Forest; Bexley and Greenwich; Bromley and Lewisham; Kingston upon Thames and Richmond upon Thames; Lambeth and Southwark; and Westminster and the City of London. They are all borough constituencies.\n\nThe Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval.

{"id": "1967367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967367", "title": "Consignee", "text": "Consignee\n\nIn a contract of carriage, the consignee is the entity who is financially responsible (the buyer) for the receipt of a shipment. Generally, but not always, the consignee is the same as the receiver.\n\nIf a sender dispatches an item to a receiver via a delivery service, the sender is the \"consignor\", the recipient is the \"consignee\", and the deliverer is the \"carrier\".\n\nThis is a difficult area of law in that it regulates the mass transportation industry which cannot always guarantee arrival on time or that goods will not be damaged in the course of transit. Furthermore, two other problems are that unpaid consignors or freight carriers may wish to hold goods until payment is made, and fraudulent individuals may seek to take delivery in place of the legitimate consignees. The key to resolving such disputes lies in the documentation. The standard form of contract is a bill of lading which, in international shipping law, is simply a contract for the carriage of goods entered into between the shipper and the carrier that is not a charter party. It is always a term of that contract that the carrier must deliver the goods to a specific receiver. \n\nA straight bill of lading by land or sea, or air waybill are not documents of title to the goods they represent. They do no more than require delivery of the goods to the named consignee and (subject to the shipper's ability to redirect the goods) to no other. This differs from an \"order\" or \"bearer\" bill of lading which are possessory title documents and negotiable, i.e. they can be endorsed and so transfer the right to take delivery to the last endorsee. This aspect of shipping law is regulated by the Hague Rules, and the laws of individual countries, e.g. the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 and the U.S. Pomerene Act 1916. There is some international dispute as to whether the consignee on a straight bill must produce the bill in order to take delivery. The U.S. position is that the person taking delivery must prove his or her identity but, as in Hong Kong, there is no need to present the bill itself. In the UK there are conflicting \"obiter dicta\" in \"The Rafaela S\" [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 113 and \"The Happy Ranger\" [2002] 2 AER (Comm) 23, so the matter must remain unclear even though there are serious problems, for example, arising from the everyday occurrence of cargo being discharged against letters of indemnity when original bills of lading are not yet available to be presented at the discharge port.\n\nThe rights of the consignee under an air waybill are regulated by the Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, 1929 and the Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air 1999 and the relevant state laws (which may be one law chosen as the proper law by the parties, or any combination of laws representing the seller, buyer, consignor, and carrier.)\nThis is very important as per export documents.\n\nThe receiver can be different than that of the consignee.\n\nIt is helpful to give and take the information about to be paid and received.\nIt helps to settle dispute as it includes the detail about the goods and terms of trade and payment.\nIt informs the selling price to the consignee. \nIt helps to know the quality , the quantity, the price and the discount to the importer."}

He graduated from the Sea Cadet Corps in 1868 and subsequently circumnavigated the globe on the clipper \"Wsadnik\". After his return to Russia, he was promoted to warrant officer in 1870 and to lieutenant in 1873. From 1875 to 1878 he received specialized training as a naval artillery and mine warfare expert. Thereafter he served in various functions on ships of the Russian Baltic Fleet. In 1885, as a captain of the second rank, he was assigned his first command, that of the gunboat \"Groza\". He subsequently served as an inspector of works for the Marine Technical Committee, and as the Assistant Chief Inspector of Mines, was responsible for testing naval mines.\n\nIn 1892, Vitgeft took over command of the cruiser \"Voyevoda\" and was promoted to Captain 1st Rank in 1894. On 26 October 1899 Withöft was promoted to Rear Admiral and was transferred to the Russian Pacific Fleet. He was awarded the Order of St. Stanislaus (1st class with Swords) for participation in the Russian-Chinese War of 1900, and was also decorated by the Empire of Japan with the Order of the Rising Sun, 2nd class. He served as chief of staff to Viceroy, Yevgeny Alekseyev, from 1900–1903.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, Vitgeft became chief of the Naval Headquarters in the Far East. Following the death of Admiral Stepan Makarov, Vitgeft was appointed temporary commander of the \"First Pacific Squadron\", that portion of the Russian Pacific Fleet trapped at Port Arthur by the Japanese blockade. Vitgeft made one aborted attempt to break out of Port Arthur on 23 June. On 7 August, he suffered from a leg wound caused by a shell splinter during the Japanese bombardment of Port Arthur.\n\nViceroy Alekseyev, an admiral, favored an aggressive sortie so as to enable the First Pacific Squadron to link up with the Vladivostok Squadron and thereby create a naval force powerful enough to challenge the Japanese fleet. Vitgeft believed \"in a fleet in being\", which simply stayed at anchor, while at the same time contributing some of his weaponry to the land battle as the safest course to follow. Although passive, Vitgeft's preference was actually more in keeping with the Russian Navy's doctrine, which was building up strength (waiting for the arrival of the Russian Baltic Fleet, renamed as the \"2nd Pacific Squadron\"), and then engaging the Japanese navy in decisive battle. \n\nAlekseyev appealed to St. Petersburg, and Tsar Nicholas II replied that he fully shared the Viceroy's opinion. Faced with an Imperial writ and threat of legal action, Admiral Vitgeft was ordered to sail for Vladivostok immediately. By 06:15 hours, on 10 August 1904, Admiral Vitgeft, flying his flag in the battleship \"Tsesarevich\", began leading his fleet from the harbor.\n\nThe Russian fleet consisted of the battleships , , , , , and \"Poltava\", the protected cruisers , , and , and 14 destroyers. In the subsequent Battle of the Yellow Sea, the Imperial Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet under Admiral Togo Heihachiro intercepted the Russian fleet. At 18:40 on 10 August 1904, Admiral Vitgeft and his immediate staff were killed instantly when a 305 mm salvo from the Japanese battleship struck the upper bridge of the Russian flagship \"Tsesarevich\". The shell also jammed the flagship's steering into a shaft port turn, which threw the Russian line of battle into confusion. Five battleships, a cruiser and nine destroyers escaped back to Port Arthur; however, the damaged \"Tsesarevich\" and three escorting destroyers sailed to Kiaochou, where they were interned by German authorities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1967388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967388", "title": "Dvapara Yuga", "text": "Dvapara Yuga\n\nThe Dvapara Yuga, also spelled as Dwapara Yuga, is the third out of four Yugas, or ages, described in the scriptures of Hinduism. Dvapara in Sanskrit literally means \"two ahead\", that is, something in the third place. The Dvapara Yuga follows the Treta Yuga and precedes the Kali Yuga. According to the Puranas, this yuga ended at the moment when Krishna returned to his eternal abode of Vaikuntha. According to the Bhagavata Purana, the Dvapara Yuga lasts 864,000 years or 2400 divine years.\n\nThere are only two pillars of religion during the Dvapara Yuga: compassion and truthfulness. Vishnu assumes the colour yellow and the Vedas are categorized into four parts: Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda. During these times, the Brahmins are knowledgeable of two or three of these but rarely have studied all the four Vedas thoroughly. Accordingly, because of this categorization, different actions and activities come into existence.\n\nAll people in the Dvapara Yuga are desirous of achievement of the scriptural dharma that is prescribed to each class, valiant, courageous and competitive by nature and are engaged only in penance and charity. They are kingly and pleasure-seeking. In this era, the divine intellect ceases to exist, and it is therefore seldom that anyone is wholly truthful. As a result of this life of deceit, people are plagued by ailments, diseases and various types of desires. After suffering from these ailments, people realize their misdeeds and perform penance. Some also organize Yagya for material benefits as well as for divinity.\n\nIn this Yuga, the Brahmanas are involved in Yagya, self-study and teaching activities. They attain celestial bliss by engaging in penance, religion, control of senses, and restraint.\n\nThe duties of Kshatriyas are the protection of their subjects. In this era, they are humble and perform their duties by controlling their senses. The Kshatriyas honestly execute all policies of law and order without being angry or cruel. They are devoid of injustice towards the ordinary citizens and consequently attain bliss.\n\nThe king avails the advice of the learned scholars and accordingly maintains law and order in his empire. The king who is addicted to vices will definitely end up defeated. One or two or all from Sāma, Dāna, Danda, Bheda and Upeksha is/are brought into use and help attain the desired. Kings are diligent in maintaining public decorum and order.\n\nA few of the kings, however, surreptitiously plan a conspiracy along with the scholars. Strong people execute work where execution of policies is involved. The king appoints priests, etc. to perform religious activities, economists and ministers to perform monetary activities, impotents to take care of women, and cruel men to execute heinous activities.\n\nThere are two kshatriya dynasties, namely 'Surya Vansha' and 'Chandra Vansha'.\n\nVaishyas are mostly landowners and merchants. The duties of Vaishyas are trade and agriculture. Vaishyas attain higher planes through charity and hospitality.\n\nThe duty of Shudras is to perform tasks that demand highly physical work. Vedas says everyone is a born shudra and with their deeds, they can become a kshatriya, brahman, or vaishya. For political reasons Shudras had difficulty going up the ranks unless they were extraordinary. Vidura, the famous Prime Minister of Hastinapura was born in the Shudra community and attained the status of a Brahmin due to his wisdom, righteousness, and learning.\n\nIn 1894, Swami Sri Yukteswar, with his book \"The Holy Science\", broke from Hindu tradition in stating that the earth is not in the age of Kali Yuga, but has advanced to Dwapara Yuga. His proof was based on a new perspective of the precession of the equinoxes, correcting a problem of \"interpretation\" of the ancient texts.\n\nIn Namco's \"Soul\" series, Kilik, the wielder of the Kali Yuga staff, also possess the mirror sash by the same name. In the end of the battle against Inferno, he uses the mirror to extinguish the flames. In \"Soulcalibur II\", \"Soulcalibur III\", and \"Soulcalibur IV\" he wears a necklace that includes a piece of the Dvapara Yuga used as a pendant for rituals.\n\n"}

{"id": "1967398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967398", "title": "Upper Soda Springs", "text": "Upper Soda Springs\n\nUpper Soda Springs is on the banks of the Sacramento River in Dunsmuir, California, USA. It consists of approximately ten acres (40,000 m²) of level ground on both sides of the River, the surrounding hillsides, and continues north along the eastern bank of the Sacramento River to the Dunsmuir City Park. The State of California and the City of Dunsmuir are creating a new park on this historic site. The Upper Soda Springs site contains a riparian ecosystem and includes its namesake mineral water springs. In large part because of its location on the Siskiyou Trail, the site mirrors the history of the state and of the American West.\n\nBefore the California Gold Rush, the site had no permanent inhabitants. The nearest inhabitants, members of the Okwanuchu tribe, used the site as a temporary campground during the annual salmon fishing season. Another nearby tribe, the Wintu, likely did not have regular habitation sites this far north along the Sacramento.\n\nThe first European or American visitors in the area were likely hunters and trappers, including Hudson's Bay Company hunting and trapping parties headed by Michel Laframboise, coming down from the Pacific Northwest during the 1820s-30s. As early as the 1830s, a pioneer cattle drive led by Ewing Young, along what was to become known as the Siskiyou Trail from Mexican-controlled California to settlements in Oregon, stopped at Upper Soda Springs. In 1841, an overland party of the United States Exploring Expedition with cartographers and botanists entered the upper Sacramento River canyon, and recorded visits to mineral springs sites on the upper Sacramento River, including passing through Upper Soda Springs.\n\nThe discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in 1848, brought the Forty-Niners to California in search of riches during the California Gold Rush. For the next ten years, these prospectors spread from the original Gold Country region of the Sierra Nevada throughout the state. Discovery of gold near Yreka, California in 1851 greatly increased the traffic between California's Central Valley and Yreka, and north into Oregon and Washington.\n\nPackers with mule trains joined the prospectors heading north, following existing Native American foot trails through rugged mountains, including the Sacramento River canyon. A rustic wayside hostel for these travelers was the first permanent habitation on the site, established in the early 1850s. During this same time, a band of Wintu, fleeing the predation of the Forty-Niners on the Trinity River, crossed the mountains, and settled near the springs.\n\nIn about 1855, a toll bridge crossing the Sacramento River was built on the site by pioneers Ross McCloud and Mary Campbell McCloud. During the next 30 years, the first stagecoach road between the Central Valley and Oregon passed through the site and a more substantial inn was developed, with a covered \"springhouse\" to allow the public to enjoy the \"soda water\" from the mineral springs (on the far right in the image to right.) Notably, the name \"Dolly Varden trout\" was first given to a colorful local fish species by Elda McCloud, the daughter of Ross and Mary McCloud.\n\nThe arrival of the Central Pacific railroad in 1886 heralded still further expansion of the inn. Now known as the Upper Soda Springs Resort, it was a destination for well-to-do Victorian Era travelers who would come to \"take the waters\" at the mineral springs.\n\nWith the increasing popularity of the automobile in the 20th century, vacation tastes changed, and the Resort closed by 1920. The property was subdivided, and became private residences and businesses.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, through public and private efforts, riverside parcels of the historic Upper Soda Springs Resort property were acquired and dedicated to park land. Sections of the site have been restored and further work is planned.\n\nTauhindauli Park and Trail has been developed along the beautiful Sacramento River canyon on the former site of Upper Soda Springs resort on the banks of the Sacramento River in Dunsmuir, California. It consists of approximately ten acres of level ground on the bank of the river, the surrounding hillsides, and continues north along the eastern bank of the Sacramento River to the Dunsmuir City Park in the heart of Dunsmuir. Long a favorite local fishing spot, swimming hole, and a site of both historical and ecological significance, this special place has finally received the attention it deserves and has been improved to enhance its recreational opportunities and esthetics. Environmental work and levee restructuring has been done which has improved flood control for the entire town. This is a river restoration project which has created a natural park with pathways which wind through native grasses and plants, no manicured lawns can be found.\n\nWalking trails, fishing access and picnic areas are available so the natural beauty of the Sacramento River can be enjoyed to the fullest.

{"id": "1967412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967412", "title": "Karun Treasure", "text": "Karun Treasure\n\nKarun Treasure is the name given to a collection of 363 valuable Lydian artifacts dating from the 7th century BC and originating from Uşak Province in western Turkey, which were the subject of a legal battle between Turkey and New York Metropolitan Museum of Art between 1987–1993 and which were returned to Turkey in 1993 after the Museum admitted it had known the objects were stolen when they had purchased them. The collection is alternatively known as the \"Lydian Hoard\". The items are exhibited in the Uşak Museum of Archaeology.\n\nThe collection made sensational news once again in May 2006 when a key piece, a golden hippocamp, on display in Uşak Museum along with the rest of the collection, was discovered to have been switched with a fake, probably between March and August 2005,\n\nYet another term used for the collection is \"Croesus Treasure\". Although the artifacts were closely contemporary to Croesus, whether they should be directly associated with the legendary Lydian king or not remains debatable. Croesus' wealth had repercussions on a number of Asian cultures in a vein similar to his fame in the western cultures, and is referred to either as \"Qarun\" (Arabic, Persian) or Karun (Turkish), or Korah, with the mythical proportions of his fortune also echoed in various ways, parallel to the English language expression \"as rich as Croesus\". This explains why the term \"Karun Treasure\" took hold, and in any case, the king Croesus' Treasure consisted of more than 363 pieces and the tomb chamber tumulus where most artifacts were discovered (they originate from close but different sites) was that of a woman.\n\nThe main and the most precious part of the treasure comes from a tomb chamber of a Lydian princess reached through illegal excavations carried out by three fortune-seekers from Uşak's depending Güre village, at the proximity of which the tomb was located, at the locality called Toptepe. After having dug for days and unable to break through the marble masonry of the chamber door, they had dynamited the roof of the tomb in the night of 6 June 1966, to be the first to see the breathtaking sight of the buried Lydian noblewoman and her treasures after 2600 years. The treasure looted from this particular tomb was enriched by further finds by the same men in other tumuli of the locality during 1966-1967. The collection was smuggled outside Turkey in separate dispatches through İzmir and Amsterdam, to be bought by the Metropolitan Museum of Art between 1967–1968, at an invoiced cost of $1.2 million for 200 of the pieces within the collection.\n\nThe efforts made by successive Turkish governments to retrieve the collection were incited since the very beginning and followed until conclusion by the journalist Özgen Acar. Acar had chanced upon some pieces of the collection for the first time in 1984 in a Met Museum catalogue and had informed Turkey's Ministry of Culture of their clear provenance, while he also wrote several articles and pursued the bureaucratic channels within Turkey with insistence throughout the affair. He acted as a voluntary envoy of the Ministry within the frame of the judicial case launched in New York City in 1987 and brought to conclusion in 1993, at the same time as he was named consultant in the larger framework of the Turkey's participation in the work carried out by UNIDROIT regarding the protection of historic, cultural and religious heritage. Acar's name is also synonymous in Turkey for the retrieval of another set of smuggled archaeological goods, termed \"Elmalı Treasure\" in reference to their site of origin, the town of Elmalı in southwestern Turkey, and involving this time Lydian coins and extremely rare decadrachms dating from the period of the Delian League, with the Boston Museum of Fine Arts as his opposite party.\n\nThe clear need for a museum worthy of the treasure was being voiced ever since the artifacts had returned to Turkey. With the seizure by the authorities of ten other illegally excavated artifacts in 1998, further archaeological discoveries and the known presence of eight gold pieces that had appeared in 2000 during an exhibition in a Paris private gallery for which attempts for retrieval were yet to be made, a handsome collection of base consisting of a total of 375 pieces was already accumulated. But the small museum in Uşak where the collection was placed, more focused on storage of Ushak carpets and operating under conditions of budgetary and staff restraints, did not fully meet the requirements for the preservation of Karun Treasure. Doubts about the site's suitability were reinforced by the filing of currently unresolved legal action against museum staff regarding the 2007 theft. The museum's former director remains the only person to be still kept in custody among the ten initially accused in the frame of the case around the hippocamp's replacement with a fake.\n\nSome in Uşak and beyond associate the treasure with a curse. Legend has it that the seven men who took part in the illegal digs \"died violent deaths or suffered great misfortune\".\n\n"}

The expedition began on 10 August 1519 with five ships. However, \"Victoria\" was the only ship to complete the voyage, returning on 6 September 1522. Magellan was killed in the Philippines. \n\nThe ship was built at a shipyard in Ondarroa, with the Basques being reputed shipbuilders at the time, and along with the four other ships, she was given to Magellan by King Charles I of Spain (The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V). \"Victoria\" was named after the church of Santa Maria de la Victoria de Triana, where Magellan took an oath of allegiance to Charles V. \"Victoria\" was an 85-ton ship with a crew of 42.\n\nThe four other ships were \"Trinidad\" (110 tons, crew 55), \"San Antonio\" (120 tons, crew 60), \"Concepcion\" (90 tons, crew 45), and \"Santiago\" (75 tons, crew 32). \"Trinidad\", Magellan's flagship, \"Concepcion\", and \"Santiago\" were wrecked or scuttled; \"San Antonio\" deserted the expedition during the navigation of the Straits of Magellan and returned to Europe on her own.\n\n\"Victoria\" was a carrack or \"nao\", as were all the others except \"Santiago\", which was a caravel.\n\nWhile agreeing on its Basque origin, for a long period the vessel was thought to have been constructed in Zarautz, next to Elcano's home town Getaria. However, research conducted by local historians has revealed that the nao Victoria was built at the shipyards of Ondarroa in Biscay. It was originally called Santa Maria, owned by Domingo Apallua, a ship pilot, and his son, Pedro Arismendi.\n\nAccording to a notarial document dating from 1518, the ship had been used in previous years for trade between Castile and England. Royal Castilian officials bought the ship at a set price of 800 gold ducats, a figure at odds with the estimation on the ship's real value provided by the accountant of Magellan's expedition, and accepted by the owners only against their will. The ship was named Victoria by Magellan after the chapel he frequented on his prayers in Seville, the Santa María de la Victoria.\n\nThe voyage started with a crew of about 265 men aboard five ships, however only 18 men returned alive on \"Victoria\", while many others had deserted. Many of the men died of malnutrition. At the beginning of the voyage, Luis de Mendoza was her captain. On 2 April 1520, after establishing a settlement in Puerto San Julian in Patagonia, a fierce mutiny involving three captains broke out but was ultimately quelled. Antonio Pigafetta's and other reports state that Luis de Mendoza and Gaspar Quesada, captain of \"Concepcion\", were executed and their remains hung on gallows on the shore. \n\nJuan de Cartagena, captain of \"San Antonio\", was marooned on the coast. According to Pigafetta, after Magellan's death on 27 April 1521, at the Battle of Mactan, remnants of the fleet tried to retrieve his body without success. Thereafter, Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese who had sided with Magellan in facing the mutiny, and João Serrão were elected leaders of the expedition. On 1 May 1521, they were invited by rajah Humabon of Cebu to a banquet ashore to receive a gift for the king of Spain. At the banquet, most of the crew were killed or poisoned, including Duarte Barbosa and João Serrão, who the natives wanted to exchange for Western weapons, but was left behind by the remaining crew. Pilot João Carvalho, who had survived the trap, then became the captain of \"Victoria\". In August, near Borneo he was deposed and Juan Sebastián Elcano became captain for the remainder of the expedition.\n\nOut of an entire expedition of 260 people, only 18 returned to Seville with the expedition (many others deserted), which by the end was only made up of the crew of \"Victoria\".\n\nThey were:\n\nOut of all these survivors, Antonio Pigafetta was the most significant because his journals supply most of the information known about the first expedition around the world.\n\nThe long circumnavigation began in Seville in 1519 and returned to Sanlúcar de Barrameda on 6 September 1522, after sailing , of which was largely unknown to the crew. On 21 December 1521, \"Victoria\" sailed on from Tidore in Indonesia alone because the other ships left the convoy due to lack of rations. The ship was in terrible shape, with her sails torn and only kept afloat by continuous pumping of water. \"Victoria\" managed to return to Spain with a shipload of spices, the value of which was greater than the cost of the entire original fleet.\n\n\"Victoria\" was later repaired, bought by a merchant shipper and sailed for almost another fifty years before being lost with all hands on a trip from the Antilles to Seville in about 1570.\n\nA vignette of the \"Victoria\" forms the logo of the Hakluyt Society, a London-based text publication society founded in 1846, which publishes scholarly editions of primary records of historic voyages, travels and other geographical material. The logo appears on the cover of all the Society's published volumes.\n\nA replica of the ship was built in 1992 and is operated by the Fundación Nao Victoria, Seville.\n\nIn 2006, to celebrate the Bicentennial of Chile, an entrepreneur from Punta Arenas founded a project to build another replica of the ship. The search for the original plans of \"Nao Victoria\" took longer than expected and the project was delayed by almost three years, from 2006 to 2009. The replica was finally completed by 2011. Although it was not possible to complete the project in time for the celebration of the bicentennial in 2010, the project’s creator received a Presidential Medal from the President of Chile.\n"}

This form earned him a transfer to Leeds United where he won the First Division championship. After spending seven years at Leeds, Dick Advocaat signed him on a Bosman ruling transfer for Rangers where he scored 41 league goals and was part of the squad that won five out of six trophies in their first two seasons. After leaving Rangers in 2001 he signed for Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer for a season and then Gillingham before retiring from professional football.\n\nHe signed for the Saints as an apprentice in 1986 along with his twin brother Ray Wallace. Elder brother Danny Wallace had already become an established member of the Southampton first team.\n\nOn 22 October 1988, his two brothers Danny and Ray lined up alongside him in the Southampton team in a match at The Dell against Sheffield Wednesday; this was the first time three brothers had played in the same team in English professional top-flight football. In his best season at Southampton, 1989-90, he scored 21 goals in all competitions. The previous season also saw his goal tally go well into double figures, as did the season after, as he formed an exciting young strikeforce with Alan Shearer and Matthew Le Tissier, which soon attracted interest from a number of bigger clubs.\n\nThe following year he played against Bulgaria, Republic of Ireland and United States for the England under-21 team.\n\nFellow top-flight team Leeds United signed him for £1.6 million in the summer of 1991, and he helped them win the old First Division championship and Charity Shield competition a year later.\n\nHe became an integral part of the Leeds squad for the next seven years and was found often playing as an out-and-out striker or in a more wide position on the flanks. In September 1992, Wallace was called up to the senior England squad for a friendly against Spain, but had to pull out because of injury. He was never called up for international duty again.\n\nHe scored a hat-trick for Leeds on the last day of the 1992–93 season in a 3–3 draw at Coventry City.\n\nWallace won the 1993–94 Goal of the Season competition with a mazy dribble against Tottenham Hotspur in a Premier League game on 17 April 1994. His brother, Danny, had won the same award 10 seasons earlier, making them the first and, to date, only brothers to gain the accolade. Leeds finished fifth at the end of that season, repeating this finish in 1995 and 1998. Wallace's contract with the Elland Road club was due to expire in the summer of 1998 and this resulted in a Bosman transfer move to Scotland to join Rangers.\n\nWhilst North of the Border the speedy Londoner acquired a flurry of medals to add to the silverware previously won during his time in England. In his first season, he won the domestic treble, finishing as top scorer with 27 goals and scoring the winning goal in the 1999 Scottish cup final win over Celtic, the first cup final to be played at the fully renovated Hampden Park.

Wallace successfully helped Bolton stave off relegation, but was on the move again after rejecting new one-year contract remain at the club.\n\nIn June 2002 he joined Gillingham on a two-year contract and managed to score 12 goals in his first full season at the Priestfield Stadium. His time with the Gills was blighted by a succession of injuries and at the end of the 2003–04 season he announced his retirement from professional football. The summer of 2004 saw him return to Southampton in a one-off benefit game organised for elder brother Danny who has been diagnosed with the condition Multiple sclerosis.\n\nIn January 2008, he was appointed as assistant manager of Kingstonian's under 18 side, before joining Molesey for season 2010–11.

The term is used mainly in Malaysia and parts of Sumatra, whereas most Indonesians use the word \"dukun\". It is often mistranslated into English as medicine man or witch doctor. In colloquial usage, the term \"bomoh\" is often interchangeable with another type of shaman, the pawang, but they generally serve different functions. The \"bomoh\" is primarily a healer, herbalist, geomancer, and sorcerer. The \"pawang\" on the other hand usually specialises in rituals involving weather, nature, animals, and a good harvest. Their roles do overlap however, and both act as an intermediary for the spirits and gods.\n\nThe word \"bomoh\" (at times spelled \"bomo\" or \"bomor\") has been in common usage since at least classical times. It is a cognate of the Thai term \"maw\" or \"mohr\". This word can mean either doctor or a sorcerer, as in terms like \"mawpii\" (spirit doctor) and \"mawduu\" (fortune-teller). Prior to the later introduction of the English-derived \"doktor\" or the Arabic word \"tabib\", the \"bomoh\" served as healers and physicians in Malay society. Thai shamans or \"bomoh Siam\" are traditionally held in high regard in Malaysia. Malay texts such as the Hikayat Aceh (1600-1625) record the word \"bomoh\" simply as \"mo\" or \"moh\".\n\nShamanism in Southeast Asia can be traced to the region's prehistoric tribal people. The \"bomoh's\" original role was that of a healer and their expertise was first and foremost an in-depth knowledge of medicinal herbs and tajul muluk or Malay geomancy. This was supplemented by Sanskrit \"mantera\" (mantra) owing to the ancient Hindu-Buddhist influence in the region. Before European colonisation, \"bomoh\" - along with Buddhist monks and Hindu holymen - were often exempt from paying taxes, due to the fact that many of them had few material belongings.\n\nThe \"bomoh's\" craft remained largely unchanged even after Islam became dominant until the Islamic revival in the 1970s and 80s. \"Bomoh\" were then seen as deviant from the Muslim faith because of their invocation of spirits and the potentially harmful black magic they were accused of practicing. This period saw a drastic decline in traditional herbalism and many fraudulent practitioners filled the void. As a result, \"bomoh\" are today looked at with suspicion even though they are still commonly consulted for personal reasons. Many \"bomoh\" today have tried to adapt their practice in the context of modern Islam, such as reciting verses of the Quran or invoking the names of Allah, but this is viewed as shallow by conservative shamans.\n\nMalay metaphysical theory holds that the body, and in fact the universe itself, is made up of the four classical elements of fire, water, earth, and wind. Illnesses are often said to be caused by an imbalance of these elements. To restore this balance, patients are advised to bathe in cool water to which lime juice is added. The \"bomoh\" also works with rituals and incantations, called \"jampi\".\n\nSome \"bomoh\" use cemeteries to summon spirits to fulfill requests by supplicants, while others only deal with a single spirit. It is said that sometimes the \"bomoh\" selects the spirit, while other times, it is the spirit who selects the \"bomoh\". Spirits are said to be able to heal the sick, seek missing persons or even investigate reasons for bad luck. Spirits can also be used to attack people, cause sickness and misery and many other bad things. \"Bomo\"h who have a particular religion may incorporate their religious practices into their craft.\n\nTraditionally, healing rituals of some \"bomoh\" involved music and dance, such as the \"main puteri\" or \"main peteri\" (a trance-dance from Kelantan and Terengganu often connected to mak yong), the \"main lukah\" (a fisherman's dance from Pahang), and the \"main saba\" (which re-enacts the heavenly princesses [\"puteri kayangan\"] dancing around a saba tree). The music is played by an assistant called the \"tuk minduk\".\n\nIn 2014, shortly after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Dato Mahaguru Ibrahim Mat Zin, who proclaimed himself as the \"Raja Bomoh\" (King of \"Bomoh\") with his male assistant, appeared in public offering to locate the missing plane by conducting a series of rituals at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The ritual involved using a pair of bamboo binoculars to view the inside of a traditional fish trap. Ibrahim claimed that the plane was suspended in the air amongst three locations which were the Philippines, South China Sea and on an unidentified country and it was hidden by the \"orang-orang bunian\" (\"the Bunian\", a supernatural race resembling humans, akin to elves in Malay legend). Beside the ritual, Ibrahim Mat Zin also stated that 100,000 seni gayong martial artists had performed prayers for the missing plane and its passengers.\n\nA few days later he and his four assistants, three males and one female came to KLIA, bringing along a water gourd, holy Zamzam water from Mecca, a small surat Ya Sin book and several other items to conduct another ritual. This time, Ibrahim Mat Zin used two coconuts and knocked them against each other with his two bare hands while shouting takbir. Then, his three male assistants sat on the \"magic carpet\" and using a number of \"magical artifacts\" such as a walking stick, a basket and two coconuts, and thus started the infamous scene, while local and international photographers took a few shots. Ibrahim Mat Zin claimed that the purpose of the ritual is to weaken the spirits' hold on the plane.\n\nThe incidents drew international attention, eventually becoming the subject of an online game application called \"Bomoh: Rescue Run\" developed by a company named Triapps, which surpassed more than 100,000 downloads in Google Play. Minister for Youth and Sports Khairy Jamaluddin, who was not amused by the activities of the \"bomoh\", tweeted in regards to the incident: \"Somebody should arrest those magic carpet bomohs. Memalukan (humiliating)\". He even resorted to contacting Jamil Khir, the Minister for Islamic Affairs, to deal with the bomoh. Meanwhile, the Malaysian Department of Islamic Advancement had issued a fatwa that Ibrahim Mat Zin's methods contradict Islamic teachings. Some netizens had also pointed out the similarities of the antics of the \"bomoh\" with a scene in the P. Ramlee movie \"Laksamana Do Re Mi\" where the main characters ride on a flying mat, while the bamboo binoculars session once held by Ibrahim Mat Zin to locate the missing plane mimic Re's magic single vision binocular in the movie.\n\nIn 2017, the very same \"Bomoh\" from the flight MH370 ritual conducted a ritual in what he perceived to protect Malaysia from North Korea in wake of the strained tensions between the two nations.\n\n"}

In 1957, he went to the United States and attended Fuller Theological Seminary where he met Dr. Bill Bright, the founder of Campus Crusade for Christ International. In 1958, with collaboration and support from Bright, Kim established Korea Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2004, with much fanfare, Kim retired and appointed Sung Min Park as his successor.\n\nKim was also a famous Korean Christian Evangelist. The story goes that during the springtime, as Kim's family was enjoying the day, an angry band of communist guerrillas invaded the village where Kim lived, killing everyone, including Kim's family. The guerrillas killed Kim's wife and father. Kim was beaten and left for dead. Late, he awoke and fled to the safety of the mountains with his young daughter, Unhi Kim.\n\nKim learned from Scriptures to love his enemies and pray for those who persecuted him. The Spirit of God impressed upon him that he was to return to the village, seek out the communist leader who had led the attack and tell the communist leader, who killed Kim's wife and father, that he loved and forgave the communist leader, and to speak to the communist leader of God's love through Christ. This eventually happened, and the communist leader ended up kneeling in prayer with Kim and gave his life to Christ.

{"id": "1967493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967493", "title": "Prefrontal cortex", "text": "Prefrontal cortex\n\nIn mammalian brain anatomy, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the cerebral cortex which covers the front part of the frontal lobe. The PFC contains the Brodmann areas BA8, BA9, BA10, BA11, BA12, BA13, BA14, BA24, BA25, BA32, BA44, BA45, BA46, and BA47.\n\nMany authors have indicated an integral link between a person's will to live, personality, and the functions of the prefrontal cortex. This brain region has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behavior, personality expression, decision making, moderating social behavior, and moderating certain aspects of speech and language. The basic activity of this brain region is considered to be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals.\n\nThe most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function. Executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social \"control\" (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes).\n\nThe frontal cortex supports concrete rule learning. More anterior regions along the rostro-caudal axis of frontal cortex support rule learning at higher levels of abstraction.\n\nThere are three possible ways to define the prefrontal cortex:\n\nThe prefrontal cortex has been defined based on cytoarchitectonics by the presence of a cortical granular layer IV. It is not entirely clear who first used this criterion. Many of the early cytoarchitectonic researchers restricted the use of the term prefrontal to a much smaller region of cortex including the gyrus rectus and the gyrus rostralis (Campbell, 1905; G. E. Smith, 1907; Brodmann, 1909; von Economo and Koskinas, 1925). In 1935, however, Jacobsen used the term prefrontal to distinguish granular prefrontal areas from agranular motor and premotor areas. In terms of Brodmann areas, the prefrontal cortex traditionally includes areas 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25, 32, 44, 45, 46, and 47, however, not all of these areas are strictly granular – 44 is dysgranular, caudal 11 and orbital 47 are agranular. The main problem with this definition is that it works well only in primates but not in nonprimates, as the latter lack a granular layer IV.\n\nTo define the prefrontal cortex as the projection zone of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus builds on the work of Rose and Woolsey, who showed that this nucleus projects to anterior and ventral parts of the brain in nonprimates, however, Rose and Woolsey termed this projection zone \"orbitofrontal.\" It seems to have been Akert, who, for the first time in 1964, explicitly suggested that this criterion could be used to define homologues of the prefrontal cortex in primates and nonprimates. This allowed the establishment of homologies despite the lack of a granular frontal cortex in nonprimates.\n\nThe projection zone definition is still widely accepted today (e.g. Fuster), although its usefulness has been questioned. Modern tract tracing studies have shown that projections of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus are not restricted to the granular frontal cortex in primates. As a result, it was suggested to define the prefrontal cortex as the region of cortex that has stronger reciprocal connections with the mediodorsal nucleus than with any other thalamic nucleus. Uylings et al. acknowledge, however, that even with the application of this criterion, it might be rather difficult to define the prefrontal cortex unequivocally.\n\nA third definition of the prefrontal cortex is the area of frontal cortex whose electrical stimulation does not lead to observable movements. For example, in 1890 David Ferrier used the term in this sense. One complication with this definition is that the electrically \"silent\" frontal cortex includes both granular and non-granular areas.\n\nAccording to Striedter the PFC of humans can be delineated into two functionally, morphologically, and evolutionarily different regions: the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) consisting of the \"ventral prefrontal cortex\" and the \"medial prefrontal cortex\" present in all mammals, and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), consisting of the \"dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\" and the \"ventrolateral prefrontal cortex\", present only in primates.\n\nThe LPFC contains the Brodmann areas BA8, BA9, BA10, BA45, BA46, and BA47. Some researchers also include BA44. The vmPFC contains the Brodmann areas BA12, BA25, BA32, BA33, BA24, BA11, BA13, and BA14.\n\nThe table below shows different ways to subdivide parts of the human prefrontal cortex based upon Brodmann areas.\n\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is highly interconnected with much of the brain, including extensive connections with other cortical, subcortical and brain stem sites. The dorsal prefrontal cortex is especially interconnected with brain regions involved with attention, cognition and action, while the ventral prefrontal cortex interconnects with brain regions involved with emotion. The prefrontal cortex also receives inputs from the brainstem arousal systems, and its function is particularly dependent on its neurochemical environment. Thus, there is coordination between our state of arousal and our mental state. The interplay between the prefrontal cortex and socioemotional system of the brain is relevant for adolescent development, as proposed by the Dual Systems Model.\n\nThe medial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the generation of slow-wave sleep (SWS), and prefrontal atrophy has been linked to decreases in SWS. Prefrontal atrophy occurs naturally as individuals age, and it has been demonstrated that older adults experience impairments in memory consolidation as their medial prefrontal cortices degrade. In monkeys, significant atrophy has been found as a result of neuroleptic or antipsychotic psychiatric medication. In older adults, instead of being transferred and stored in the neocortex during SWS, memories start to remain in the hippocampus where they were encoded, as evidenced by increased hippocampal activation compared to younger adults during recall tasks, when subjects learned word associations, slept, and then were asked to recall the learned words.\n\nThe ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) has been implicated in various aspects of speech production and language comprehension. The VLPFC is richly connected to various regions of the brain including the lateral and medial temporal lobe, the superior temporal cortex, the infertemporal cortex, the perirhinal cortex, and the parahippoccampal cortex.These brain areas are implicated in memory retrieval and consolidation, language processing, and association of emotions. These connections allow the VLPFC to mediate explicit and implicit memory retrieval and integrate it with language stimulus to help plan coherent speech. In other words, choosing the correct words and staying “on topic” during conversation come from the VLPFC. \n\nThe original studies of Fuster and of Goldman-Rakic emphasized the fundamental ability of the prefrontal cortex to represent information not currently in the environment, and the central role of this function in creating the \"mental sketch pad\". Goldman-Rakic spoke of how this representational knowledge was used to intelligently guide thought, action, and emotion, including the inhibition of inappropriate thoughts, distractions, actions, and feelings. In this way, working memory can be seen as fundamental to attention and behavioral inhibition. Fuster speaks of how this prefrontal ability allows the wedding of past to future, allowing both cross-temporal and cross-modal associations in the creation of goal-directed, perception-action cycles. This ability to represent underlies all other higher executive functions.\n\nShimamura proposed Dynamic Filtering Theory to describe the role of the prefrontal cortex in executive functions. The prefrontal cortex is presumed to act as a high-level gating or filtering mechanism that enhances goal-directed activations and inhibits irrelevant activations. This filtering mechanism enables executive control at various levels of processing, including selecting, maintaining, updating, and rerouting activations. It has also been used to explain emotional regulation.\n\nMiller and Cohen proposed an Integrative Theory of Prefrontal Cortex Function, that arises from the original work of Goldman-Rakic and Fuster. The two theorize that “cognitive control stems from the active maintenance of patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex that represents goals and means to achieve them. They provide bias signals to other brain structures whose net effect is to guide the flow of activity along neural pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task”. In essence, the two theorize that the prefrontal cortex guides the inputs and connections, which allows for cognitive control of our actions.\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is of significant importance when top-down processing is needed. Top-down processing by definition is when behavior is guided by internal states or intentions. According to the two, “The PFC is critical in situations when the mappings between sensory inputs, thoughts, and actions either are weakly established relative to other existing ones or are rapidly changing”. An example of this can be portrayed in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Subjects engaging in this task are instructed to sort cards according to the shape, color, or number of symbols appearing on them. The thought is that any given card can be associated with a number of actions and no single stimulus-response mapping will work. Human subjects with PFC damage are able to sort the card in the initial simple tasks, but unable to do so as the rules of classification change. \nMiller and Cohen conclude that the implications of their theory can explain how much of a role the PFC has in guiding control of cognitive actions. In the researchers' own words, they claim that, “depending on their target of influence, representations in the PFC can function variously as attentional templates, rules, or goals by providing top-down bias signals to other parts of the brain that guide the flow of activity along the pathways needed to perform a task”.\n\nExperimental data indicate a role for the prefrontal cortex in mediating normal sleep physiology, dreaming and sleep-deprivation phenomena.\n\nWhen analyzing and thinking about attributes of other individuals, the medial prefrontal cortex is activated, however, it is not activated when contemplating the characteristics of inanimate objects.\n\nStudies using fMRI have shown that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), specifically the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC), may modulate mimicry behavior. Neuroscientists are suggesting that social priming influences activity and processing in the amPFC, and that this area of the prefrontal cortex modulates mimicry responses and behavior.\n\nAs of recent, researchers have used neuroimaging techniques to find that along with the basal ganglia, the prefrontal cortex is involved with learning exemplars, which is part of the \"exemplar theory\", one of the three main ways our mind categorizes things. The exemplar theory states that we categorize judgements by comparing it to a similar past experience within our stored memories.\n\nA 2014 meta-analysis by Professor Nicole P.Yuan from the University of Arizona found that larger prefrontal cortex volume and greater PFC cortical thickness were associated with better executive performance.\n\nA widely accepted theory regarding the function of the brain's prefrontal cortex is that it serves as a store of short-term memory. This idea was first formulated by Jacobsen, who reported in 1936 that damage to the primate prefrontal cortex caused short-term memory deficits. Karl Pribram and colleagues (1952) identified the part of the prefrontal cortex responsible for this deficit as area 46, also known as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). More recently, Goldman-Rakic and colleagues (1993) evoked short-term memory loss in localized regions of space by temporary inactivation of portions of the dlPFC. Once the concept of working memory (see also Baddeley's model of working memory) was established in contemporary neuroscience by Alan Baddeley (1986), these neuropsychological findings contributed to the theory that the prefrontal cortex implements working memory and, in some extreme formulations, only working memory. In the 1990s this theory developed a wide following, and it became the predominant theory of PF function, especially for nonhuman primates. The concept of working memory used by proponents of this theory focused mostly on the short-term maintenance of information, and rather less on the manipulation or monitoring of such information or on the use of that information for decisions. Consistent with the idea that the prefrontal cortex functions predominantly in maintenance memory, delay-period activity in the PF has often been interpreted as a memory trace. (The phrase \"delay-period activity\" applies to neuronal activity that follows the transient presentation of an instruction cue and persists until a subsequent \"go\" or \"trigger\" signal.)\n\nTo explore alternative interpretations of delay-period activity in the prefrontal cortex, Lebedev et al. (2004) investigated the discharge rates of single prefrontal neurons as monkeys attended to a stimulus marking one location while remembering a different, unmarked location. Both locations served as potential targets of a saccadic eye movement. Although the task made intensive demands on short-term memory, the largest proportion of prefrontal neurons represented attended locations, not remembered ones. These findings showed that short-term memory functions cannot account for all, or even most, delay-period activity in the part of the prefrontal cortex explored. The authors suggested that prefrontal activity during the delay-period contributes more to the process of attentional selection (and selective attention) than to memory storage.\n\nVarious areas of the prefrontal cortex have been implicated in a multitude of critical functions regarding speech production, language comprehension, and response planning before speaking. Cognitive neuroscience has shown that the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is vital in the processing of words and sentences.\n\nThe right prefrontal cortex has been found to be responsible for coordinating the retrieval of explicit memory for use in speech, whereas the deactivation of the left is responsible for mediating implicit memory retrieval to be used in verb generation. Impaired recollection of nouns (explicit memory) is impaired in some amnesic patients with damaged left prefrontal cortices, but verb generation remains intact because of its reliance on left prefrontal deactivation.\n\nMany researchers now include BA45 in the prefrontal cortex because together with BA44 make up an area of the frontal lobe called Broca's Area. Broca's Area is the widely considered the output area of the language production pathway in the brain (as opposed to Wernike's area in the medial temporal lobe, which is seen as the language input area). BA45 has been shown to be implicated for the retrieval of relevant semantic knowledge to be to be used in conversation/speech. The right lateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) is implicated in the planning of complex behavior, and together with bilateral BA45, they act to maintain focus and coherence during speech production. However, left BA45 has been shown to be activated significantly while maintaining speech coherence in young people. Older people have been shown to recruit the right BA45 more so than their younger counterparts. This aligns with the evidence of decreased lateralization in other brain systems during aging.\n\nIn addition, this increase in BA45 and RLPFC activity in combination of BA47 in older patients has been shown to contribute to “off-topic utterances.” The BA47 area in the prefrontal cortex is implicated in “stimulus-driven” retrieval of less-salient knowledge than is required to contribute to a conversation. In other words, elevated activation of the BA47 together with altered activity in BA45 and the broader RLPFC has been shown to contribute to the inclusion of less relevant information and irrelevant tangential conversational speech patterns in older subjects.\n\nIn the last few decades, brain imaging systems have been used to determine brain region volumes and nerve linkages. Several studies have indicated that reduced volume and interconnections of the frontal lobes with other brain regions is observed in patients diagnosed with mental disorders and prescribed potent antipsychotics; those subjected to repeated stressors; those who excessively consume sexually explicit materials; suicides; those incarcerated; criminals; sociopaths; those affected by lead poisoning; and daily male cannabis users (only 13 people were tested). It is believed that at least some of the human abilities to feel guilt or remorse, and to interpret reality, are dependent on a well-functioning prefrontal cortex. It is also widely believed that the size and number of connections in the prefrontal cortex relates directly to sentience, as the prefrontal cortex in humans occupies a far larger percentage of the brain than in any other animal. And it is theorized that, as the brain has tripled in size over five million years of human evolution, the prefrontal cortex has increased in size sixfold.\n\nA review on executive functions in healthy exercising individuals noted that the left and right halves of the prefrontal cortex, which is divided by the medial longitudinal fissure, appears to become more interconnected in response to consistent aerobic exercise. Two reviews of structural neuroimaging research indicate that marked improvements in prefrontal and hippocampal gray matter volume occur in healthy adults that engage in medium intensity exercise for several months.\n\nA functional neuroimaging review of meditation-based practices suggested that practicing mindfulness enhances prefrontal activation, which was noted to be correlated with increased well-being and reduced anxiety; however, the review noted the need for cohort studies in future research to better establish this.\n\nTreatments with anti-cancer drugs often are toxic to the cells of the brain, leading to memory loss and cognitive dysfunction that can persist long after the period of exposure. Such a condition is referred to as chemo brain. To determine the basis of this condition, mice were treated with the chemotherapeutic agent mitomycin C. In the prefrontal cortex, this treatment resulted in an increase of the oxidative DNA damage 8-oxodG, a decrease in the enzyme OGG1 that ordinarily repairs such damage, and epigenetic alterations.\n\nChronic intake of alcohol leads to persistent alterations in brain function including altered decision making ability. The prefrontal cortex of chronic alcoholics has been shown to be vulnerable to oxidative DNA damage and neuronal cell death.\n\nPerhaps the seminal case in prefrontal cortex function is that of Phineas Gage, whose left frontal lobe was destroyed when a large iron rod was driven through his head in an 1848 accident. The standard presentation (e.g.) is that, although Gage retained normal memory, speech and motor skills, his personality changed radically: He became irritable, quick-tempered, and impatient—characteristics he did not previously display — so that friends described him as \"no longer Gage\"; and, whereas he had previously been a capable and efficient worker, afterward he was unable to complete tasks. However, careful analysis of primary evidence shows that descriptions of Gage's psychological changes are usually exaggerated when held against the description given by Gage's doctor, the most striking feature being that changes described years after Gage's death are far more dramatic than anything reported while he was alive.\n\nSubsequent studies on patients with prefrontal injuries have shown that the patients verbalized what the most appropriate social responses would be under certain circumstances. Yet, when actually performing, they instead pursued behavior aimed at immediate gratification, despite knowing the longer-term results would be self-defeating.\n\nThe interpretation of this data indicates that not only are skills of comparison and understanding of eventual outcomes harbored in the prefrontal cortex but the prefrontal cortex (when functioning correctly) controls the mental option to delay immediate gratification for a better or more rewarding longer-term gratification result. This ability to wait for a reward is one of the key pieces that define optimal executive function of the human brain.\n\nThere is much current research devoted to understanding the role of the prefrontal cortex in neurological disorders. Clinical trials have begun on certain drugs that have been shown to improve prefrontal cortex function, including guanfacine, which acts through the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor. A downstream target of this drug, the HCN channel, is one of the most recent areas of exploration in prefrontal cortex pharmacology.\n\nThe term \"prefrontal\" as describing a part of the brain appears to have been introduced by Richard Owen in 1868. For him, the prefrontal area was restricted to the anterior-most part of the frontal lobe (approximately corresponding to the frontal pole). It has been hypothesized that his choice of the term was based on the prefrontal bone present in most amphibians and reptiles.\n\n\n \n"}

In late May, Hartsfield was elected by a large margin being the only well-known candidate. Lyle died on December 14, 1948 at the age of 64.\n\n"}

{"id": "1967507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967507", "title": "Maryland Route 213", "text": "Maryland Route 213\n\nMaryland Route 213 (MD 213) is a state highway located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the United States. The route runs from MD 662 in Wye Mills, Queen Anne's County north to the Pennsylvania border in Cecil County, where the road continues into that state as Pennsylvania Route 841 (PA 841). The route, which is a two-lane undivided highway most of its length, passes through mostly rural areas as well as the towns of Centreville, Chestertown, Galena, Cecilton, Chesapeake City, and Elkton. MD 213 intersects many routes including U.S. Route 50 (US 50) near Wye Mills, US 301 near Centreville, and US 40 in Elkton. It crosses over the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal in Chesapeake City on the Chesapeake City Bridge. MD 213 is designated by the state as the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway between the southern terminus and Chesapeake City with the portion north of MD 18 in Centreville a National Scenic Byway. In addition, the route is also considered part of the Atlantic to Appalachians Scenic Byway between Chesapeake City and MD 273 in Fair Hill.\n\nThe route was initially designated as US 213 in 1926 when the U.S. Highway System was established, running from Ocean City west and north to US 40 in Elkton. The highway was rerouted to cross the Nanticoke River in Vienna by 1933, with the former route between Mardela Springs and Eldorado becoming a part of MD 313 and the alignment between Eldorado and Rhodesdale becoming part of MD 14. US 213 was rerouted to use the Emerson C. Harrington Bridge over the Choptank River in Cambridge in 1939; the former alignment between Vienna and Easton became MD 331. Meanwhile, the road between Elkton and the Pennsylvania border became MD 280. US 213 was moved to a bypass of Easton and straight alignment between Easton and Wye Mills in 1948. A year later, the southern terminus was cut back to US 50 in Wye Mills, with an extended US 50 replacing US 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City. In 1971, US 213 and MD 280 were decommissioned and replaced with MD 213.\n\nMD 213 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial within the town of Elkton.\n\nMD 213 begins at an intersection with MD 662 (Wye Mills Road) in Wye Mills, Queen Anne's County, heading to the north on College Drive, a two-lane undivided road. From the southern terminus, MD 213 is designated by the state as the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway. The road heads into rural farmland, passing Chesapeake College on the west side of the road before intersecting US 50 (Ocean Gateway). Past this intersection, MD 213 continues north on Centreville Road, passing more farms as well as some residences. The route continues into a mix of woods and farmland before intersecting the northern terminus of MD 309 (Starr Road). A short distance later, the route reaches an interchange with US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway).\n\nPast the US 301 interchange, MD 213 continues through more rural areas before entering the town of Centreville, where it passes some residential and commercial areas. It intersects MD 18 (4H Park Road). At this intersection, MD 213 becomes a part of the National Scenic Byway portion of the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway. Past MD 18, the route continues into residential areas, eventually splitting into a one-way pair with northbound MD 213 following Commerce Street and southbound MD 213 following Liberty Street. This pairing continues past residences before heading into the downtown area, where the road intersects MD 304 (Water Street). Westbound MD 304 joins northbound MD 213 for a concurrency that lasts until the Broadway intersection north of the Queen Anne's County Courthouse, where it continues to the west; MD 304 is unsigned along the concurrency with MD 213.\nMD 213 leaves downtown Centreville past MD 304. The one-way pair ends and the route continues north on two-lane undivided Liberty Street, passing by residences and some businesses. At the end of the one-way pair, the route sees an average of 12,912 vehicles daily. It intersects the western terminus of MD 305 (Hope Road), and passes by more residences before becoming Church Hill Road, which heads north into a mix of woods and farms with some housing developments. It angles to the northeast and then north through more rural areas, consisting mostly of farm fields with some wooded areas and occasional residences. MD 213 continues in a northeast direction before reaching the town of Church Hill.\n\nUpon reaching Church Hill, the route intersects MD 19A (South Main Street), which loops to the east of MD 213 to head into the town. Meanwhile, MD 213 bypasses Church Hill to the west, running through woodland, and intersects the western terminus of MD 300 (Sudlersville Road). The route heads back into farmland and intersects MD 19 (North Main Street), leaving the Church Hill area. MD 213 continues north through a mix of woods and farms. From here, the route turns northwest through more farmland before it passes some residences and businesses near the intersection with the western terminus of MD 544 (Mcginnis Road). Past the MD 544 intersection, the road continues through rural areas, but residences and businesses start to increase. MD 213 passes through Kingstown before crossing the Chester River on a drawbridge.\n\nUpon crossing the Chester River, MD 213 enters the town of Chestertown in Kent County, where the route heads northwest on Maple Avenue through residential areas. It intersects MD 289 (Cross Street) in the downtown area and turns north onto Washington Avenue at the intersection with Spring Avenue. Washington Avenue carries MD 213 north through residential neighborhoods and passes to the west of the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Chestertown and by Washington College. Past the college, the route gains a center left-turn lane and continues past business, intersecting MD 291 (Morgnec Road). Past this intersection, MD 213 continues through residential and commercial areas before it narrows back to a two-lane road.\n\nThe road leaves Chestertown and becomes Augustine Herman Highway, which is named for Bohemian surveyor Augustine Herman. The road heads into farmland with residences along the west side of the road. MD 213 intersects MD 297 (Worton Road) and heads past more farm fields. The road turns northeast and intersects MD 561 (Hassenger’s Corner Road). It continues through more rural areas, consisting mostly of farms with some wooded areas before reaching Kennedyville, where MD 213 passes residences. In Kennedyville, the road crosses the Chestertown Branch of the Northern Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad at-grade.\n\nUpon leaving Kennedyville, MD 213 continues back into agricultural areas. The route makes a turn to the east, with an old bypassed segment remaining as unsigned MD 855. MD 213 intersects MD 298 (Browntown Road) and resumes northeast and east again. It intersects unsigned MD 449 (Shallcross Wharf Road), which connects to MD 444 (Kentmore Park Road), which MD 213 intersects a short distance later. From here, the route continues east and northeast through more farmland before heading into a mix of farms and woods. The route enters the town of Galena, where it becomes Cross Street. In the center of town, MD 213 meets MD 290 and MD 313 at the intersection with Main Street. Here, MD 290 and MD 313 continue south on Main Street, MD 290 continues east on Cross Street, and MD 213 makes a left turn to head north on Main Street. Main Street passes residences before leaving Galena, where the road becomes Augustine Herman Highway again. The road continues through a mix of farms and woods before reaching Georgetown, where the route passes some homes before crossing the Sassafras River on a drawbridge near a marina.\n\nMD 213 enters Cecil County upon crossing the Sassafras River, where it continues north through wooded and agricultural areas with some residences. The route enters the town of Cecilton, where it becomes Bohemia Avenue. In Cecilton, MD 213 passes residences along with a few businesses and intersects MD 282 (Main Street) in the center of town. Upon leaving Cecilton, the name of the road becomes Augustine Herman Highway again. The Cecilton area is home to a small Amish settlement. MD 213 passes through farmland, with intermittent woods and rural residences, before crossing over the Bohemia River. Past the Bohemia River, the road turns northeast through more rural areas before intersecting the western terminus of MD 310 (Cayots Corner Road) in Cayots. Past MD 310, the route continues through farms and woods with some residences and businesses before heading into the Chesapeake City area, where residences increase along the road and it passes to the east of Bohemia Manor High School. Upon reaching the town of Chesapeake City, MD 213 features an interchange with MD 537, which provides access to the southern portion of Chesapeake City as well as to MD 286 and MD 342.\n\nIn Chesapeake City, the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway ends and MD 213 continues north as a part of the Atlantic to Appalachians Scenic Byway which crosses the state of Maryland. Past this interchange, MD 213 passes over the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal on the Chesapeake City Bridge. Upon crossing the canal, the road intersects MD 285 (Lock Street), which provides access to the northern portion of Chesapeake City. Past MD 285, the route resumes through a mix of woodland and farmland, crossing Long Creek and Perch Creek, with residential areas increasing along the road. It approaches the Elkton area and heads through residential areas.\n\nMD 213 enters the town of Elkton at the intersection with US 40 (Pulaski Highway). Past this intersection, the route heads northwest on Bridge Street, passing through commercial areas as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The route narrows to two lanes before it crosses Big Elk Creek and intersects Main Street, which continues east of MD 213 as a one-way street eastbound. Past Main Street, the road continues north and passes over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line before intersecting MD 545 (Elkton Boulevard). MD 213 continues past commercial areas to the west and residential areas to the east as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane before its intersection with MD 279 (Newark Avenue). Past the MD 279 intersection, the route narrows back to two lanes before it leaves Elkton and becomes Singerly Road, which continues past residences. MD 213 enters a mix of woods and farms and passes over Interstate 95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line within a short distance of each other. It continues through a mix of farms and residences before the road reaches the Leeds roundabout with Leeds Road west of the community of Cherry Hill. Past the roundabout, the route resumes north, intersecting MD 273 (Telegraph Road) in Fair Hill west of the Fair Hill Training Center, where the Atlantic to Appalachians Scenic Byway leaves MD 213 and heads west along MD 273. From here, MD 213 continues northwest and west as Lewisville Road through a mix of rural areas and residences before ending at the Pennsylvania border. Here, the road continues north as PA 841 into Lewisville, intersecting the southern terminus of PA 472 just north of the state line.\n\nIn 1911, what would become US 213 was completed as a state highway between Hebron and Riverton via Mardela Springs, Easton and Longwoods, Centerville and Church Hill, and in the Chestertown area, while the present road between Elkton and Singerly was also built as a state highway. The portion of roads between Riverton and Sharptown, Brookview and Hurlock, Church Hill and southeast of Chestertown, northeast of Chestertown and northeast of Kennedyville, and Chesapeake City and Elkton were under contract to be built as state roads. At this time, a state highway was proposed along the segments between Ocean City and Berlin, Salisbury and Hebron, Sharptown and Brookview, Hurlock and Easton, Longwoods and Centreville, northeast of Kennedyville and Chesapeake City, and Elkton and Fair Hill. By 1915, the entire length of road between Ocean City and Elkton was completed as a state highway. The state highway between Singerly and south of Fair Hill was finished by 1923. The state highway was finished to Fair Hill by 1927.\n\nWith the creation of the U.S. Highway System on November 11, 1926, US 213 was designated to run from the Atlantic Ocean in Ocean City west and north to US 40 in Elkton. The route headed west from Ocean City through Berlin and Salisbury (where it intersected its parent route US 13), before it turned northwest to Mardela Springs. Here, US 213 turned to the north and ran to Eldorado, where it continued northwest through Hurlock and Preston to Easton. From Easton, the route continued north to Wye Mills and followed the present alignment of MD 213 to Elkton. A new Dover Bridge over the Choptank River east of Easton, replacing a bridge built in the 19th century, was completed in 1932. By 1933, US 213 was rerouted to cross the Nanticoke River at Vienna instead of at Sharptown. The route headed west from Mardela Springs to Vienna, where it turned north to Rhodesdale. The former alignment of US 213 became a southern extension of MD 313 between Mardela Springs and Eldorado and an eastern extension of MD 14 between Rhodesdale and Eldorado.\nIn 1939, US 213 was realigned to cross the Choptank River at Cambridge on the Emerson C. Harrington Bridge that opened in 1935. The route replaced MD 344 between Vienna and Mount Holly, ran concurrent with MD 16 between Mount Holly and Cambridge, and turned north across the river to continue to Easton. The former routing of US 213 between Vienna and Easton became MD 331. In 1939, the road between US 40 and the northern terminus of US 213 in Elkton and the Pennsylvania border north of Fair Hill was designated MD 280. The portion of MD 280 between Fair Hill and the Pennsylvania border was built as a state highway by 1933. On July 28, 1942, the vertical lift bridge carrying US 213 over the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal, built in 1927, was destroyed when the tanker \"Franz Klasen\" struck it. The destroyed bridge was replaced by the current Chesapeake City Bridge, which opened in 1949. The approaches to the original bridge are now designated as MD 537 and a western extension of MD 285. \n\nUS 213 was relocated to a new divided highway alignment to the north between Herring Creek in West Ocean City and Ocean City in 1942, including a new bridge across Sinepuxent Bay into Ocean City (the current Harry W. Kelley Memorial Bridge). The bypassed portion of US 213 remained a state highway and was designated MD 707 by 1948. A portion of US 213 south of Easton was moved to a straight alignment by 1946; the former routing became MD 565. By 1946, work was underway for a bypass to the east of Easton along with a straight alignment between Easton and Wye Mills. US 213 was moved to this new alignment in 1948, with the former alignment on Washington Street in Easton becoming an extended MD 333 in the southern part of the city and an extended MD 33 in the northern part the city, while MD 662 was designated on the original alignment between Easton and Wye Mills.\n\nIn 1949, US 50 was extended from Annapolis across the Chesapeake Bay, first via a ferry run by the Maryland State Roads Commission, then over the original span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge when it was completed in the middle of 1952, all the way to Ocean City. The southern terminus of US 213 was cut back to US 50 in Wye Mills, with the former route of US 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City becoming part of the newly extended US 50. The former routing of US 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City is now US 50 between Wye Mills and Vienna, Old Route 50 through Vienna, US 50 between Vienna and Salisbury, US 50 Bus. through Salisbury, MD 346 between Salisbury and east of Berlin, and US 50 between east of Berlin and Ocean City. On December 3, 1971, the American Association of State Highway Officials approved the elimination of the US 213 designation. US 213 along with MD 280 were replaced by MD 213, which ran from MD 662 in Wye Mills north to the Pennsylvania border north of Fair Hill. In 1994, the at-grade intersection with US 301 was replaced with an interchange.\n\n\n"}

The legal drama starred Rob Lowe as a lawyer named Jack Turner, newly appointed as partner of a long-established law firm that, as the plot revealed, harbored some dark secrets; the series' title and firm's name are allusions to the surname of Lowe, who also served as executive producer. Much of the plot centered on the firm's internal politics and on Turner's attempts to uncover information on some of the firm's conspiracies while acting as the defense for some of the firm's higher-profile clients in a different case each episode.\n\nThe cast, headed by Lowe, also included Matt Craven, Elizabeth Mitchell, Kyle Chandler, Frances Fisher, and David Krumholtz.\n\nThe series premiered on the American television network NBC on September 28, 2003, but although thirteen episodes were ordered and produced, only six aired before NBC cancelled the series on November 30, 2003, due to poor ratings. When the UK's channel Five bought the UK terrestrial TV rights to the series in 2004, it aired all thirteen episodes. Years later, Rob Lowe later stated that after finding about the show's cancellation he and the show's producers decided to make the last episodes - which they were contractually obligated to make - as absurd as possible, including an \"off the wall\" and freakish ending.\n\nCharacter descriptions courtesy of \"Entertainment Weekly\" and \"The Blade\"\n\nIn his memoir, \"Love Life\", Lowe stated that he lobbied for singer-actress Jewel to be cast as his love interest in the show after seeing her performance Ang Lee's cult film \"Ride With The Devil\". However, when she arrived on set there was no chemistry between the two and Jewel brought her then-boyfriend, rodeo star Ty Murray, to the set with her on the day the actors were to film a love scene. According to Lowe, Jewel appeared uncomfortable at having to kiss Lowe, and unsuccessfully asked if the scene could be removed.\n\nFinally relenting by stating, \"Let's just do this\", Lowe said Jewel agreed to do the scene. Lowe stated: \"But as we approached the kissing moment it became strained and it's never good when you can't trust that your fellow actor is on the same page... I pecked her on the lips; her mouth scrunched closed like you would do if someone was going to stick something unwanted into it, which I was not intending. I sort of moved my head from side to side to make it look real, like there was at least a dollop of energy or passion. 'Cut', said the director. Jewel looked at me and wiped the back of her hand across her lips like an American Sign Language version of 'Yuck'\".\n\nJewel was one of the celebrities chosen to roast Rob Lowe in 2015. She joked that she had asked to write out the kiss with Lowe \"because I knew where that mouth had been.\"\n\nLowe said, in an May 9, 2014 appearance on the NPR radio gameshow \"Wait Wait Don't Tell Me\", that he and the show's producers purposefully made all 13 episodes - which they were contractually obligated to make for possible DVD distribution - as absurd as possible. The last episode ended with Lowe's character being exposed as a serial killer by Grant Rushton (Kyle Chandler), whom he then kills before jumping to his death from the firm's office tower.\n\n"}

Launched in 2001, it replaced \"Quantum\", which had ceased the previous year. \"Catalyst\" is regularly broadcast on ABC TV at 8:30pm on Tuesdays and repeated 6.00pm on Sundays.\n\nThe show broadcasts stories on scientific themes, and in particular significant recent developments and discoveries. It focuses primarily on stories relevant to Australia, but the series covers international developments as well. It attempts to convey information in a way that is not only accurate but also interesting and informative to the general population, often discussing the ethical, political, and other implications of scientific discoveries and research as well as the discoveries themselves.\n\nThe show's website describes it as follows:\n\nPrime examples of \"Catalyst\" featured segments include \"Corporate Psychopaths\", \"The Truth About Vitamins\", and \"Smell and Schizophrenia\".\n\nThe show originally was broadcast in a 30-minute format. Following a series of controversies and an internal review of the program, the ABC announced in November 2016 that \"Catalyst\" will shift to a 60-minute format starting 2017.\n\nThe new format utilises out-of-house talent who are experts in their respective fields, presenting 60-minute in depth documentaries. Documentaries aired have included \"The Great Australian Bee Challenge\", \"Bionic Revolution\", \"Feeding Australia\" and \"The Secret To Making Better Decisions\".\n\nThe Catalyst team is composed of specialised science journalists, science communicators and producers, each with different specialisations and roles. Over Catalyst's history, the staff has included:\n\n\n\nA series of episodes (\"Heart of the Matter, Parts 1 and 2\") broadcast in October 2013 which questioned the link between saturated fat, cholesterol and heart disease, as well as the widespread use of anti-cholesterol drugs known as statins, have come under fire from doctors and the National Heart Foundation of Australia. The Foundation estimates that in the wake of those episodes up to 55,000 patients may have stopped taking their medication, leading to a potential increase in heart attacks and strokes over the next five years. In May 2014 the ABC removed both episodes from its website, after an internal review found that the second episode (but not the first) involved one breach of ABC standards on impartiality and there was a problem of omission of important information.\n\n\"Wi-Fried?\", an episode broadcast in February 2016 featuring American epidemiologist Devra Davis courted further controversy by claiming that electromagnetic radiation emitted by devices such as mobile phones lead to an increased risk of brain cancer in heavy users, contrary to the mainstream view that exposure to such emissions is largely safe. The show faced criticism from local experts, viewers and scientists disputing the episode's claims, with public health professor Simon Chapman stating that \"this is not the first time \"Catalyst\" have aired a questionable episode, and there really needs to be a review of their editorial process\". An investigation by the ABC's independent Audience and Consumer Affairs Unit found that the episode breached editorial policies standards on accuracy and impartiality, later leading to the withdrawal of the episode from the ABC website. The controversy led to the temporary suspension of reporter Dr. Maryanne Demasi from the show and is the second time since \"Heart of the Matter, Parts 1 and 2\" to have breached editorial standards. It also led to the ABC reviewing the future strategy and direction of the program, leading to format changes for the following series.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1967516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967516", "title": "WTRF-TV", "text": "WTRF-TV\n\nWTRF-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 7, is a CBS/MyNetworkTV/ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Wheeling, West Virginia, United States and also serving Steubenville, Ohio. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group. WTRF's studios are located on 16th Street in downtown Wheeling, and its transmitter is located in Bridgeport, Ohio.\n\nThe station signed-on for the first time on October 24, 1953. It was co-owned with WTRF radio (1290 AM, now WLIE, and 100.5 FM, now WBGI-FM) which had signed on across the Ohio River in Bellaire, Ohio, in 1947. The call letters stood for Two Radio Frequencies, a nod to FM 100.5 being used to continue programming when AM 1290 signed off at sunset. The radio stations were sold off in the 1970s to help finance the television station. \n\nWTRF was originally an NBC affiliate but also carried some programming from ABC, splitting that network's programming with then-CBS affiliate WSTV-TV (channel 9, now WTOV-TV). In 1979, WTRF became the area's first station to use videotape rather than film. \n\nFor its first quarter-century on the air, WTRF-TV was the undisputed leader in the Wheeling–Steubenville market despite being well within reach of the much larger Pittsburgh market. As of 2017, the Wheeling–Steubenville market remains separate from Pittsburgh despite the very close proximity between the two markets as well as significantly overlapping signals between the two markets.\n\nOn January 7, 1980, WTRF swapped network affiliations with WTOV and became a CBS affiliate. NBC had struggled in the ratings for a number of years at the time and WTRF wanted a stronger affiliation. It also dropped the remaining ABC programs from its schedule. This was not as serious a problem as it appeared, since Pittsburgh's WTAE-TV (channel 4) and Youngstown's WYTV (channel 33) were available in the area on cable, with channel 4's over-the-air signal covering most portions of the Wheeling–Steubenville market. However, the switch backfired disastrously. While as an NBC affiliate, channel 7 had to contend with Pittsburgh's WIIC-TV (channel 11, now WPXI), one of NBC's weakest affiliates, for network viewers, it now had to contend with KDKA-TV (channel 2), one of CBS' strongest affiliates, as it was (and remains today) widely viewable in the area both over-the-air and available on cable. This, combined with NBC's resurgence in the 1980s while CBS faltered at the same time, saw WTRF become a very distant second to WTOV in the local ratings. While CBS rebounded in the 1990s, WTRF has never really recovered, with some viewers even watching now-CBS O&O KDKA-TV for CBS programming over WTRF.\n\nAnother factor in channel 7's struggles was ownership instability. From the early 1980s through the mid 1990s, it went through three different owners. Adams Communications bought the station from Wesray Corporation in 1987 but ran into financial trouble and sold most of its stations, including WTRF, to Brisette Broadcasting in 1991. Brisette himself was nearly brought down by financial issues and merged his group with Benedek Broadcasting in 1996. West Virginia Media Holdings bought the station when Benedek declared bankruptcy in 2002.\nIn 2007, WTRF launched its second digital subchannel as a Fox and secondary MyNetworkTV affiliate. Previously, the Wheeling–Steubenville market was served by WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh as the \"de facto\" Fox affiliate.\n\nAlong with sister station WBOY-TV in Clarksburg, WTRF launched its third digital subchannel as an ABC affiliate on August 1, 2008, bringing ABC programming back to the Wheeling–Steubenville market. Previously, both the Wheeling–Steubenville and Clarksburg–Weston–Fairmont markets were served by WTAE as the \"de facto\" ABC affiliate; WYTV served as the default ABC affiliate for the western portion of the Wheeling–Steubenville market.\n\nWTRF has been digital-only since February 17, 2009. \n\nOn September 1, 2014, WTRF lost the Fox affiliation on 7.2 to WTOV. The subchannel's secondary affiliation with MyNetworkTV then became its primary, rebranding as \"\"My Ohio Valley\"\".\n\nOn November 17, 2015, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced that it would purchase the West Virginia Media Holdings stations, including WTRF-TV, for $130 million. Under the terms of the deal, Nexstar assumed control of the stations through a time brokerage agreement in December 2015, with the sale of the license assets completed on January 31, 2017.\n\nWTRF-DT2, branded on-air as My Ohio Valley, is the MyNetworkTV-affiliated second digital subchannel of WTRF-TV, broadcasting in 720p high definition on virtual and VHF channel 7.2. On cable, the subchannel is available on Xfinity channel 12.\n\nWTRF-DT2 signed-on in 2007 as a Fox and secondary MyNetworkTV affiliate. Previously, WPGH-TV out of nearby Pittsburgh served the market as the \"de facto\" affiliate. However, it is still widely available over-the-air and on cable in the area. \n\nWTRF-DT2 lost the Fox affiliation to a subchannel of WTOV-TV on September 1, 2014; in a statement, Fox said that it switched stations because WTOV has a stronger over-the-air signal than WTRF. WTRF-DT2's secondary affiliation with MyNetworkTV then became its primary affiliation.\n\nWTRF-DT3, branded on-air as ABC Ohio Valley, is the ABC-affiliated third digital subchannel of WTRF-TV, broadcasting in 720p high definition on virtual and VHF channel 7.3. On cable, the subchannel is available on Xfinity digital channel 205.\n\nWTRF launched a new third digital subchannel with ABC programming on August 1, 2008, a year after it had launched Fox programming on WTRF-DT2. Previously, WTRF and WTOV aired ABC programming in off-hours, but began phasing out ABC in the 1970s. WTRF dropped it entirely in the early 1980s, but WTOV continued to air a few ABC programs until 2000. However, WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh provided grade B coverage to most of the Wheeling–Steubenville market and was available in most area cable systems, while the far western part of the market could also get WSYX-TV in Columbus and WYTV in Youngstown. The launch of WTRF-DT3 allowed the tiny Wheeling–Steubenville market to finally receive full-time affiliates of all four major networks. Despite the presence of WTRF-DT3, however, both WTAE and WYTV retain their analog cable carriage on local Xfinity systems, with ABC Ohio Valley airing only on Xfinity digital cable.\n\nWVTX-CD had, before ceasing operations on October 25, 2017 after selling its spectrum for $6,100,391 in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s incentive auction, been simulcasting into 720p HD WTRF's MyNetworkTV and ABC subchannels (back before the necessary multiplexer equipment to transmit three feeds in HD simultaneously on one channel was as widely used and it was uncommon to have any more than two HD feeds transmitting over a single channel) but ongoing upgrades to the multiplexer equipment being utilized over WTRF's full-power signal over the two years following the spectrum sale allowed for the MyNetworkTV and ABC subchannels to both begin airing in 720p HD (albeit in a highly-compressed variation of that video resolution) over-the-air via WTRF-TV's full-power signal for full-market over-the-air HD distribution of those two subchannels (until 2017, the ABC subchannel was being offered only in 480i SD over WTRF's full-power signal and until May 2019, the MyNetworkTV subchannel was being offered only in 480i 4:3 SD over WTRF's full-power signal). CBS, MyNetworkTV, and ABC are now all available in HD over WTRF's full-power signal, and due to aggressive statistical multiplexing implemented in May 2019, MyNetworkTV now airs in 720p 16:9 HD over-the-air.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nWTRF-DT2 airs a nightly 10 o'clock broadcast known as \"7 News at 10\" (formerly known as \"Fox Ohio Valley News\", until WTRF-DT2 lost the Fox affiliation to WTOV-DT2 on September 1, 2014), which competes with a similar newscast seen on WTOV-DT2 (until WTOV-DT2 joined Fox, the newscast was the only newscast offered at that time in the market, but the station was not the first to offer a 10 p.m. newscast); the first ran on WVTX-CD. The second hour of the main channel's weekday morning show is repeated at 7 on that subchannel. WTRF-DT3 simulcasts the weekday editions of \"7 News\" at 6 a.m., noon, 6 and 11 p.m., with separate on-screen branding to denote \"\"ABC Ohio Valley\"\". Nexstar produces a half-hour evening newscast that airs at 5:30 p.m. The newscast, titled \"West Virginia Tonight\", is broadcast live from WOWK's Charleston studios in high definition on all four of the company's stations in West Virginia along with sister station WHAG, and is anchored by Dan Thorn.\n\nIn addition, there is a public affairs program called \"Decision Makers\". Hosted by company president and CEO Bray Cary, it airs on Saturday mornings at 9 and Sunday mornings at 8 on all West Virginia Media Holdings stations. In another arrangement between all of the company channels, weekend weather forecasts originated from WOWK's new facilities on Quarrier Street in downtown Charleston. This was the case until Nexstar acquired the station.\n\nOn December 29, 2011, beginning with the noon newscast, WTRF launched the first true high definition newscast in the Wheeling–Steubenville market (competing station WTOV upgraded its newscasts to 16:9 enhanced definition widescreen in April 2009). This is also the first station owned by West Virginia Media Holdings to upgrade its local newscasts to high definition. With the upgrade came new graphics and a new music package (\"Aerial\" by Stephen Arnold); the news set remained the same, although with some minor changes. The weather graphics were still shown in the 4:3 picture format until February 2012.\n\nDespite its coverage issues mentioned above, WTRF has coverage outside the market on cable. In the northeastern part of West Virginia, it is carried in Buckhannon in Upshur County, Beverley and Elkins in Randolph County and Flemington in Taylor County.\n\nAs of June 3, 2010, WTRF and its two digital subchannels are available on Dish Network. WTRF, including its MNTV and ABC subchannels, and WTOV are available on DirecTV as of November 23, 2010. Before then, Wheeling–Steubenville had been one of the few markets that did not get local stations on satellite. Residents living in the West Virginia side of the market, as well as Jefferson, Harrison and Tuscarawas counties in Ohio, got Pittsburgh stations on those systems.\n\nWhile Belmont and Monroe counties in Ohio qualified to get the New York City and Los Angeles stations, West Virginia Media Holdings had long balked at signing waivers allowing viewers in those two counties to receive WCBS-TV and KCBS-TV from their respective markets. This rankled viewers in those areas because satellite service is all but essential for acceptable television in this area. Belmont and Monroe counties are located in a very rugged dissected plateau. Over-the-air signals are practically unviewable in this area, and cable service is inconsistent outside the larger cities.\n\n\n"}

He initially took up the practice of law in the city of Atlanta, in the 1890s\n\nBy 1902, Key was an Atlanta city councilman representing the Sixth Ward. He ran for mayor in 1904 and 1918 first losing to, then defeating, James G. Woodward. He was easily re-elected in the 1920 election. During that second term, he established Atlanta's first City Planning Commission and issued bonds to build the Spring St. viaduct (completed December 20, 1923).\n\nHe didn't run for re-election in 1922, and when he did run in 1924, he lost.\n\nIn 1930, Key was elected to a third Term in the wake of the Atlanta graft ring scandal and early in that term he made public statements against Prohibition and the blue law bans of Sunday baseball games and Sunday movies. This precipitated a recall vote in 1932 that he would have lost if not for support from the black community. He was instrumental in getting Harry Hopkins and his WPA program to update the city sewer system and nearly a million dollars to remodel the Atlanta Municipal Auditorium and Cyclorama building. Key won a fourth term in 1934. Herbert T. Jenkins,Sr. who named a son after the mayor, was an aide and driver for Key. Jenkins later served as Chief of Police of the Atlanta Police Department for 26 years, from 1947-1973.\n\nBy the time he was campaigning for his fifth term, against William B. Hartsfield in 1936, the nearly 70-year-old Key was accused of spending only an hour a day at his office and lost a contentious race.\n\nJames L. Key died in 1939 after finally seeing the end of Prohibition.\n\nThe James L. Key Elementary School was named for the late mayor in 1963. Located at the intersection of Memorial Drive and Stovall Street, the school was closed in the 1990s.\nThe former James L. Key Golf Course, in Atlanta, was named in his honor. The golf course, along with many old Victorian-era homes in the Grant Park neighborhood were demolished in the late 1950s to make way for Interstate 20.\n\n"}

He became the Labour Party's deputy chief whip and education spokesman in the House of Lords.\n\nBorn and educated in Cardiff, Morris went on, after national service with the Welsh Regiment, to read English at Worcester College, Oxford. He stayed on at Oxford as a tutor in Old and Middle English while doing his doctorate on John Cleveland, the Cavalier poet. In 1955, he married Sandra James, and they had two children.\n\nHis major promotion came in 1971 when he began his decade as professor of English literature at Sheffield University, in succession to William Empson. From 1964 to 1986, he was general editor of the New Mermaid dramatists, and from 1974 to 1982 of the New Arden Shakespeare. He also edited the poems of Cleveland and the plays of John Ford, while using his acquired administrative skills on the board of the National Portrait Gallery. These skills were fully tested when, in 1980, he was named principal of what was then St David's University College, the smallest and most endangered part of the University of Wales. Retaining a home in Derbyshire, he saw his Lampeter appointment as an opportunity to get back in touch with his roots.\n\nIn addition to literary criticism such as his study of Harri Webb (1993) for the University of Wales Press in the \"Writers of Wales\" series, his publications included several poetry collections, including \"Tide-Race\" (1976), \"Dear Tokens\" (1987) and \"The Waters of Comfort\" (1998). His collected poems were published in the year of his death by Rare Books & Berry Ltd.\n\nIn 1990, Morris was made a life peer with the title Baron Morris of Castle Morris, of St Dogmaels in the County of Dyfed, expanding his name – to distinguish it from an earlier Baron Morris – by adding \"of Castle Morris\", a small and largely insignificant hamlet between Fishguard and St David's and actually spelt Castlemorris. He justified his appointment to the unelected body by pointing out \"Manchester United football team isn't chosen by popular vote\".\n\nA brilliant and respected speech writer, his speeches in the house were sprinkled with quotations from Shakespeare, Goldsmith, Juvenal and Alexander Pope. When Morris reminded the Tories of the saying \"Whom God wishes to destroy, he first sends mad,\" he used the original Latin.\n\nMorris never forgot his Welsh roots, and was a nationalist sympathiser. Whilst he never was a fluent speaker of the Welsh language, he fought for its legal status in the nation.\n\nLater in his political career, Morris was marginalised within the Labour Party for being too 'Old Labour' by supporters of the new party leader Tony Blair. Prior to Labour's 1997 election win, a fellow Labour politician, Bernard Donoughue, commented in his diary that Morris was among the academics who \"have never operated on the national stage and are desperately keen to get there\".\n\nMorris died aged 70 from leukaemia in 2001.\n\n"}

{"id": "1967537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967537", "title": "Emile Habibi", "text": "Emile Habibi\n\nEmile Shukri Habibi (, , 28 January 1922 – 2 May 1996) was an Israeli Arab writer of Arabic literature and a politician who served as a member of the Knesset for the communist parties Maki and Rakah.\n\nHabibi was born in Haifa on 29 August 1922, into an Anglican Palestinian Arab family. His family had originally belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem but converted to Anglicanism due to disputes within the Orthodox church. In his early life, he worked on an oil refinery and later was a radio announcer.\n\nUnder the Mandate he became one of the leaders of the Palestine Communist Party. When the 1948 Arab-Israeli War began, he remained in Haifa and became an Israeli citizen. After the war, he helped to create the Communist Party of Israel and established the communist paper \"Al-Ittihad\".\n\nIn 1956, he moved from Haifa to Nazareth and remained there for the rest of his life. He died in 1996 in Nazareth, but in his will, he expressed his wish to be buried in his beloved home, Haifa. His will also asked that his tombstone include the phrase \"remained in Haifa.\"\n\nHabibi was one of the leaders of the Palestine Communist Party during the Mandate era. He supported the 1947 UN Partition Plan. When Israel became a state he helped form the Israeli Communist Party (Maki). He served in the Knesset between 1951 and 1959, and again from 1961 until 1972, first as a member of Maki, before breaking away from the party with Tawfik Toubi and Meir Vilner to found Rakah. In 1991, after a conflict about how the party should deal with the new policies of Mikhail Gorbachev, he left the party.\n\n\"Habibi became one of the most popular authors in the Middle East as a result of works depicting the conflicts in loyalties experienced by Palestinians living as an Arab minority in the Jewish state of Israel. In such works as \"Strange Events in the Disappearance of Said Abu al-Nahs al-Mutashael\" (1974), the most notable of his seven novels, he explored the duality of those Arabs who, like himself, did not leave their homeland during the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war.\"\n\nHabibi began writing short stories in the 1950s, and his first story, \"The Mandelbaum Gate\" was published in 1954, though he did not resume literary writing until the late 1960s.\n\nIn 1972 he resigned from the Knesset in order to write his first novel: \"The Secret Life of Saeed the Pessoptimist\", which became a classic in modern Arabic literature. The book depicts the life of a Palestinian, employing black humour and satire. It was based on the traditional anti-hero Said in Arab literature. In a playful way it deals with how it is for Arabs to live in the state of Israel, and how one who has nothing to do with politics is drawn into it. He followed this by other books, short stories and a play. His last novel, published in 1992, was \"Saraya, the Ogre's Daughter\". In it he has a character state:\n\"There is no difference between Christian and Muslim: we are all Palestinian in our predicament\"\n\nIn 1990, Habibi received the Al-Quds Prize from the PLO. \nIn 1992, he received the Israel Prize for Arabic literature. His willingness to accept both reflected his belief in coexistence, though his acceptance of the Israel Prize set off a debate among the Arabic intellectual community. Habibi was accused of legitimizing what they considered Israel's \"anti-Arab\" policy. Habibi replied to the accusations: \"A dialogue of prizes is better than a dialogue of stones and bullets,\" he said. \"It is indirect recognition of the Arabs in Israel as a nation. This is recognition of a national culture. It will help the Arab population in its struggle to strike roots in the land and win equal rights\".\n\n1969: \"Sudāsiyyat al-ayyām al-sittah\"\n\n1974: \"Al-Waqāʾiʿ al-gharībah fī 'khtifāʾ Saʿīd Abī 'l-Naḥsh al-Mutashāʾil\" (translated as The Secret Life of Saeed the Pessoptimist)\n\n1976: \"Kafr Qāsim\" (\"Kafr Kassem\")\n\n1980: \"Lakʿ bin Lakʿ\" (play)\n\n1991: \"Khurāfiyyat Sarāyā Bint al-Ghūl\" (translated as \"Saraya, the Ogre's Daughter\")\n\n"}

He is best known for his in-ring work in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under the ring name Fit Finlay from 1995–2000 and simply Finlay in WWE from 2005–10. \n\nHe has held over 20 championships around the world throughout his career, including the WCW World Television Championship and the WWE United States Championship.\n\nFinlay's first match was for his father's promotion in Glynn in 1974, when he filled in for a wrestler who no-showed. He began wrestling on a full-time basis in Carrickfergus and throughout Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland for the next four years before moving to England in 1978. In England, he wrestled for various companies under the Joint Promotions banner. Finlay defeated Alan Kilby on 9 June 1982 to win his first title, the Joint Promotions British Heavy Middleweight Championship. At this time, Finlay's then-wife, Princess Paula became his manager.\n\nHe then won a tournament to crown a new British Light Heavyweight champion and fill the vacant position, defeating Ringo Rigby in the finals. Finlay soon lost the championship, but later pinned Marty Jones to win the World Mid-Heavyweight Championship. He traded it back and forth with Jones for over two years before losing it a final time to Jones via disqualification. He defeated Jones to win Joint Promotions' British Light Heavyweight Championship. In the second half of the 1980s, he defeated Frank 'Chic' Cullen on television for the British Heavy-Middleweight championship, but later lost it to Danny Collins. In 1990 he became a champion at the top of the weight range when he won All Star's British Heavyweight Championship. Finlay often competed on ITV's \"World of Sport\" programme as David \"Fit\" Finlay and had many matches against \"The American Dream\" Steve Adonis.\n\nDuring this time, Finlay also began to wrestle in Japan, then in Germany and Austria for the European promotion Catch Wrestling Association. While holding the British Heavyweight championship, he teamed with former rival Jones to win the CWA tag title from Tony St. Clair and Mile Zrno. After losing the British championship to Dave Taylor, Finlay began to focus more on the CWA, winning many of their championships.\n\nFinlay appeared at a WWF event, as they continued with their national expansion in late 1989 at a dark match, teaming with Mark Rocco, and Skull Murphy (Peter Northey), to defeat the team of Al Perez, Dusty Wolfe, and Tim Horner. This appearance was far away from the time in which Finlay would sign a full-time contract with the promotion in 2005.\n\nFinlay debuted in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1995 as the Belfast Bruiser, a nickname he had previously used while in the UK. He feuded with Lord Steven Regal in 1996, including a parking lot brawl on \"Monday Nitro\". During the feud, the Bruiser's matches were often interrupted by The Blue Bloods. At Uncensored, Bruiser won a stiff encounter with Regal by disqualification when the Blue Bloods again rushed the ring and assaulted him; Regal suffered a broken nose during the match. The feud died down thereafter and the Bruiser disappeared into the midcard.\n\nAfter a hiatus off WCW television, he abandoned the Belfast Bruiser persona and returned under the ring name Fit Finlay while sporting a short, bleached-blond buzzcut and shaved his moustache off. He was given a push upon his return, which culminated in his winning the World Television Championship on 4 May 1998 after pinning Booker T on \"Nitro\", thus setting off a three-way feud with Booker and Chris Benoit, who was also vying for the title. After Finlay lost the belt to Booker at The Great American Bash on 14 June, he fell out of the TV title picture. He then entered a feud with Alex Wright, who was angry at Finlay for having ended the wrestling career of his father, Steve Wright. The feud led to a matchup at Halloween Havoc, where Finlay was pinned by Wright.\n\nAt Bash at the Beach, he won a Junkyard Invitational involving Ciclope, Jerry Flynn, Johnny Grunge, Hak, Horace Hogan, Brian Knobs, Hugh Morrus, La Parka, Lord Steven Regal, Rocco Rock, Silver King, Squire Dave Taylor, and Mikey Whipwreck, winning a \"hardcore trophy\". He legitimately suffered a badly lacerated nerve in his leg during a hardcore match at a house show in Jackson, Mississippi on 25 July 1999, which nearly cost him use of the leg. As he was wrestling Brian Knobbs, he was thrown into a table in the corner of the ring, causing it to shatter and the shards to cut into his leg. He managed to regain use of the limb and came back later in the year, but by that point, all momentum he had from the Junkyard Invitational win was lost. In 2000, Finlay formed a trio of \"Hardcore Soldiers\" with Knobbs and The Dog. They feuded with Vampiro; the feud included a match between Finlay and Vampiro at Uncensored, which marked Finlay's last appearance on a WCW pay-per-view. His final match in WCW was at a German house show in November 2000, losing to Norman Smiley in a hardcore match. In March 2001, WCW was bought by the World Wrestling Federation.\n\nWhen WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Finlay began working for the company as a trainer for new wrestlers. He trained future WWE champions John Cena and Randy Orton and was eventually put in charge of training the WWE Divas for their matches. He assisted in the transition of the company's presentation of the WWE Divas from bra and panties matches to critically acclaimed traditional wrestling. Former WWE Diva Victoria said: \"He made us and molded us. He got to know what made us tick, exposed that, and there was nothing we couldn't do. Today, the girls pick and choose what moves they want to do. If Fit Finlay wasn't around, that wouldn't happen. We worked stiff. We made contact.\"\n\nFinlay began working on a comeback in 2004, wrestling in a match against Jamie Noble at a house show in Glasgow, and promos began airing for his impending in-ring return in 30 December 2005. His gimmick was that of a proud native Northern-Irishman who loves to fight. At the age of 47, Finlay made his first televised WWE match on the edition of 20 January 2006 of \"SmackDown!\" against Matt Hardy, which ended in a disqualification loss for Finlay. After the match, Finlay dragged Hardy to the steel ring steps and smashed Hardy's face into them with his boot, quickly establishing himself as a villain. This helped to give him the nickname, \"The Fighting Irish Bastard\". Finlay continued to establish himself on the \"SmackDown!\" roster. During February and March 2006, Finlay was involved in a feud with Bobby Lashley which began when Finlay cost Lashley his unbeaten streak by interfering in Lashley's match with JBL at No Way Out. This feud would see the pair brawl on many occasions, including a parking lot segment in which Lashley tried to overturn a car onto Finlay. Later, the pair competed in a Money in the Bank qualifier lumberjack match that Finlay won. During this time, Finlay began to wield a shillelagh as a weapon. On 2 April, Finlay competed at his first WrestleMania, WrestleMania 22. He faced five other WWE Superstars, from both the Raw and SmackDown! brands in a Money in the Bank ladder match which also included Lashley, who won a last chance battle royal. This match was eventually won by Rob Van Dam. Finlay next entered the King of the Ring tournament on \"SmackDown!\", defeating his first round opponent Chris Benoit before being beaten by his rival Lashley, who advanced to the finals at Judgment Day. Finlay helped the other finalist, Booker T, defeat Lashley in the King of the Ring finals. At the same pay-per-view, Finlay lost to Chris Benoit.\n\nBeginning on 26 May episode of \"SmackDown!\", Finlay was joined by Hornswoggle, who came out from under the ring to attack Finlay's opponents. Finlay then joined forces with William Regal as loyal subjects of the newly renamed King Booker and his Court. Both men were later \"knighted\" by the King, and Finlay briefly used the name \"Sir Finlay\". During his time as part of the court, Finlay picked up a win against World Heavyweight Champion Rey Mysterio in a non-title match before defeating the court's main foe Bobby Lashley to take Lashley's United States Championship. Finlay defended the championship on several occasions, often with help from Little Bastard, and even defended it against fellow court member William Regal at The Great American Bash. He lost the title to Mr. Kennedy on the edition of 1 September of \"SmackDown!\" in a Triple Threat match that also involved Bobby Lashley. After the title loss, Finlay continued to attack and wrestle threats to court leader Booker and his newly won World Heavyweight Championship, including Lashley and Batista. Finlay defeated Booker in a non-title singles match and lost in a four-way match at No Mercy for the title. After leaving the court, Finlay continued to feud with Batista. At Armageddon, Finlay and King Booker faced Batista and his partner, the WWE Champion John Cena from Raw, but were defeated.\n\nShortly after the Royal Rumble, Finlay began a feud with The Boogeyman. At No Way Out, he and Little Bastard defeated The Boogeyman and The Little Boogeyman. Finlay earned a place in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 23; however, Mr. Kennedy won the match. Following this loss, he would feud with Kennedy, after an attack on Little Bastard (now known as Hornswoggle) during the Money in the Bank match, and Jamie Noble for assaulting Hornswoggle after he won the Cruiserweight Championship. Finlay's feud, however, would quickly redirect to Kane after Finlay spilled coffee on him. The two also became involved with Batista and The Great Khali. At \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXV\", he and Khali lost to Batista and Kane. Kane beat him at SummerSlam. Finlay defeated Kane in a Belfast Brawl rematch a few weeks later.\nFinlay and Hornswoggle briefly separated when Hornswoggle was stripped of the Cruiserweight Title, and briefly moving to \"Raw\" with his \"illegitimate father\". Finlay then feuded with Rey Mysterio by attacking him during a confrontational interview with John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield. At No Mercy, Finlay faked an injury after taking a bump to the outside. Once placed on a stretcher, Finlay suddenly rose and attacked Mysterio, forcing Rey to be carried out on a stretcher. The feud continued at Cyber Sunday, where fans voted for the two to face-off in a Stretcher match. Mysterio came out on top, but Finlay retaliated with a victory on the edition of 9 November of \"SmackDown!\" The feud intensified further when the two faced on opposite teams at Survivor Series.\n\nFinlay reunited with Hornswoggle by coming to rescue him in a match against The Great Khali, turning both Finlay and Hornswoggle faces. At Armageddon, Finlay was placed in a match with Khali. Finlay scored an upset win after Hornswoggle interfered by hitting Khali in the groin with a shillelagh. Still battling Khali and his translator, Ranjin Singh, with Hornswoggle, he qualified for the Royal Rumble. He drew number 27, but was immediately disqualified when he entered before his time to save Hornswoggle. Hornswoggle, who was also a competitor in the Rumble, was disqualified as well. Finlay fought in the Elimination Chamber match at No Way Out, ultimately being pinned after a chokeslam on the steel floor by The Undertaker.\n\nFinlay then began making occasional appearances on \"Raw\" to protect Hornswoggle from Mr. McMahon, who had been showing him \"tough love\". After Hornswoggle was injured in a Steel Cage match by John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, Layfield revealed that Finlay was Hornswoggle's father, and not McMahon. A week after, on 3 March, Finlay admitted to this fact. At WrestleMania XXIV he was defeated by Layfield in a Belfast Brawl, where Hornswoggle also reappeared.\n\nAs part of the 2008 WWE supplemental draft, Finlay was drafted to the ECW brand. He and Hornswoggle challenged The Miz and John Morrison for the WWE Tag Team Championship at Night of Champions, but lost. Throughout the rest of 2008, Finlay challenged for the ECW Championship. He, along with Matt Hardy, Chavo Guerrero, The Miz and ECW Champion Mark Henry participated in the first ever Championship Scramble match at Unforgiven which Matt Hardy won. He defeated Mark Henry on an episode of \"ECW\" to earn an opportunity for the ECW championship, but was defeated by the champion Matt Hardy. Then he started a feud with Henry, and the feud ended when Finlay defeated Henry in a Belfast Brawl match at Armageddon.\n\nFinlay entered his third Royal Rumble match at the eponymous pay-per-view on 25 January 2009, where he entered at number 14 and lasted 30 minutes before being eliminated by Kane. At No Way Out, Finlay faced Jack Swagger for the ECW Championship in a losing effort. On 13 March episode of \"SmackDown\", Finlay defeated The Brian Kendrick to qualify for the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXV. At the event, Finlay failed to win the match as it was won by CM Punk. In the 2009 Supplemental Draft, Finlay and Hornswoggle were separated when Hornswoggle was drafted to Raw. In late May 2009, Finlay suffered a legitimate eye injury, sidelining him temporarily. He returned on 16 June, attacking ECW Champion Tommy Dreamer, Christian, and Jack Swagger. At The Bash, he participated in a Championship Scramble match for the ECW Championship, which also included Christian, Jack Swagger and Mark Henry, however the defending champion Tommy Dreamer retained. Finlay did not return to ECW after that.\n\nHe was traded to the SmackDown brand on 29 June 2009. He went on to form part of John Morrison's team at Survivor Series, but he was eliminated by Sheamus, and his team eventually lost. In late 2009, he began pursuing the Intercontinental Championship by feuding with Drew McIntyre, which he failed to win. His final televised match in WWE was on 4 June 2010 episode of \"SmackDown\" where he competed in a 15 man battle royal. He failed to win as the match was won by former rival Rey Mysterio. In 2010, Finlay more or less stepped away from the ring, becoming a full-time trainer and agent.\n\nFinlay was released in March 2011 after authorising the interruption of the American national anthem by The Miz during a house show, which offended many, including National Guard members who were in attendance. Finlay stated that his intention was to intensify the audience's dislike of The Miz in preparation for the latter's WrestleMania XXVII main event appearance, but accepted full responsibility for his dismissal.\n\nAfter being released from WWE, Finlay was contacted by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling several times, but was unable to agree upon contractual terms. He began to wrestle again on the independent circuit, making his first appearance on 26 July 2011, defeating Sami Callihan at Evolve 9.\n\nOn 20 August 2011, Finlay made his debut for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, taking part in the 2011 Battle of Los Angeles tournament. He was eliminated from the tournament in the first round by PWG World Champion Kevin Steen.\n\nOn 28 October 2011, Finlay's debut for Yoshihiro Tajiri's Smash promotion was announced, when he was revealed as the mysterious \"King of Terror\", Michael Kovac had promised to bring to the promotion and named first ever Smash Champion StarBuck's first challenger for the title. On 24 November at \"Smash.23\", Finlay defeated StarBuck to become the new Smash Champion. On 19 February, Finlay made his first successful defence of the Smash Championship, defeating TAJIRI. Prior to the event, Smash had announced that it would cease its operations on 14 March, which led to Finlay vacating the Smash Championship after the title defence.\n\nOn 6 November 2011, Finlay wrestled in the main event of a Stampede Wrestling show in Barrie, Ontario in a losing effort against Harry Smith.\n\nOn 21 January 2012, Fit Finlay returned to DOA Pro Wrestling in Portland, OR to face Ethan HD for the DOA Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOn 12 May 2012, at Border Wars, Finlay made his debut for Ring of Honor (ROH), unsuccessfully challenging Roderick Strong for the ROH World Television Championship. On 24 May, Finlay made his debut for Wrestling New Classic (WNC), the follow-up promotion to Smash, defeating Akira in the main event. Two days later, Finlay defeated Zeus in the main event of another WNC event. Finlay's first tour of WNC concluded on 27 May, when he, Akira and Syuri defeated Kana, Mikey Whipwreck and Tajiri in a six-person main event. On 24 June at ROH's iPPV, Finlay was defeated by Michael Elgin.\n\nFinlay returned to WNC on 20 September, when he defeated Ray Mendoza, Jr. in the main event at Korakuen Hall. Following the match, Finlay announced that he was done with WNC for the time being due to re-signing with WWE. Despite no longer scheduled to make appearances for WNC, Finlay was named the head of the WNC Championship Committee.\n\nFollowing a stint in the independent circuit and a year after the house show incident, Finlay returned on 11 July 2012 as a backstage producer. The two sides had been negotiating since WrestleMania XXVIII, but there were situations that delayed the deal being finalised. During the following years, Finlay made some cameo appearances, usually separating wrestlers brawling between them. Also, he was one of the four wrestlers who presented Tyler Bate with the WWE UK Championship after winning the related tournament in January 2017.\n\nAt the 2019 Royal Rumble, Finlay gave Becky Lynch the go-ahead to take the place of Lana in the women's Royal Rumble match after the latter was unable to compete following an attack by Nia Jax on the entrance way, which worsened her kayfabe ankle injury. Lynch went on to win the match.\n\nBoth Finlay's father, David Finlay Sr., and his grandfather were professional wrestlers, and his sister was a referee. His brother, Albert, was a goalkeeper for Glentoran FC in the 1960s and 1970s. Finlay was previously married to his former manager, Princess Paula. He is currently married to a German woman named Mel and has three children, the eldest of whom, David, was born in Germany.\n\nHis children are all wrestlers. The oldest, David, made his professional wrestling debut on 22 December 2012 and is now wrestling for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) and Ring of Honor (ROH). David is a former NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Champion. His daughter has won the Georgia State championship. The family resides in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1967543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967543", "title": "Alan A'Court", "text": "Alan A'Court\n\nAlan A'Court (30 September 1934 – 14 December 2009) was an English footballer who mostly played for Liverpool. He gained five caps for England and represented the nation at the 1958 FIFA World Cup.\n\nBorn in Rainhill, Lancashire, England, A'Court was a Winger who started out at Prescot Cables as an amateur before he was signed by Reds manager Don Welsh. A'Court made his debut in a league match at Ayresome Park on 7 February 1953, a game that saw Liverpool take both the points from a 3–2 win. His first goal came a month later on 14 March, again, in a league match, this time at Anfield in a 2–0 victory over Sunderland.\n\nA'Court, who followed Rugby league, signed from Prescot as an 18-year-old in September 1952, spurning the advances of Everton and Bolton Wanderers to become an Anfield apprentice, a decision that paid off as just six months after joining he made his first team debut. The following season A'Court played 16 times but Liverpool were relegated to the Second Division.\n\nDuring the Anfield club's first season in the second tier of English football A'Court established himself as a first team regular making 33 league and cup appearances. A'Court remained consistent even though Liverpool failed to regain their top flight status. By the age of 24 years and 89 days he had played 200 league games for the Reds becoming the youngest player to do so, a record that still stands.\n\nAlthough the strong and talented A'Court could have left to play for teams in the First Division, his loyalty to Liverpool was rewarded in 1961–62 when, as an ever-present, he and the Reds celebrated promotion back to the First Division under the guidance of the great Bill Shankly a full 8 points, in the days of 2 points for a win, clear of second placed Leyton Orient. A'Court was selected 23 times during Liverpool's first season back amongst football's elite teams; he helped Liverpool to a more than healthy eighth place.\n\nWhilst still in Division 2 A'Court's skill alerted England manager Walter Winterbottom, who was looking for a player to replace an injured Tom Finney; Winterbottom handed the left winger the first of his 5 caps on 6 November 1957 in a British Championship match against Northern Ireland at Wembley. A'Court's only goal for his country and a goal for Duncan Edwards were not enough to prevent England losing the game 3–2. The highlight of his career was representing England at the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, where he played in England's last three matches against Brazil (0–0), Austria (2–2), and the group stage play-off game against the USSR (0–1). He did this despite playing for a club in the Second Division.\n\nUnfortunately for A'Court, injuries began to take their toll. He missed the whole of the 1963–64 championship winning season, so Shankly signed Peter Thompson from Preston North End. After spending most of his career at Liverpool, playing 382 times and scoring 63 goals, A'Court was allowed to leave. He joined Tranmere Rovers for a fee of £4,500 in October 1964. A'Court's final outing in a Red shirt was in a historic match: Liverpool's first ever European match at Anfield, the game was a European Cup preliminary round 2nd leg match on 14 September 1964. Liverpool had won the first encounter with Icelandic side KR 5–0 but rather than treat the return leg as a mere formality, the Reds finished off the job with a comprehensive 6–1 victory.\n\nHe later became player-coach at Norwich City before taking on various coaching jobs, including posts in Zambia and New Zealand, he also became assistant manager at Stoke City when Tony Waddington called upon his services in 1969. In January 1978 George Eastham was sacked and A'Court was put in caretaker charge. His only match in charge of Stoke came in the FA Cup at home to non-league Blyth Spartans in 1977–78, Stoke lost the match 3–2.\n\nOnce new manager Alan Durban was appointed A'Court moved to Crewe Alexandra as an assistant manager. He then went to join the sport staff at North Staffordshire Polytechnic. He managed Nantwich Town from September 1983 to April 1984.\n\nAfter finally retiring from football, A'Court ran a tobacconist/newsagent shop on the borders of Birkenhead and Bebington. A'Court died of cancer on 14 December 2009. He is survived by wife Alma, son Steven and daughter Sara.\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\n\n"}

It was the first overseas mission post for Campus Crusade for Christ, founded by Dr. Bill Bright in 1951. Since its inception in 1958, Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (KCCC) has field offices both domestically and internationally spreading over countries from Asia to the Americas, including the United States. Its main focus is on world evangelism and discipleship.\n\nKorea Campus Crusade for Christ became the first overseas mission post for Campus Crusade for Christ under the tutelage of Dr. Bill Bright. KCCC ministry began in the southwestern city of Gwangjoo and quickly spread to other parts of Korea including Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Daejun, and Jeonju. Currently, KCCC headquarters is located at Buam-dong with 50 domestic mission posts and 15 international mission posts with over 1,000 missionaries abroad.\n\nAfter half a century as the head of KCCC, founder Dr. Joon Gon Kim retired his post and Reverend Sung Min Park was chosen to succeed him.\n\nOn March 11, 2016, KCCC officially announced that it would be changing its name to 'SOON Movement.' Both names would be continued to be used together as they ultimately transition to their new name.\n\n'Soon' is a Korean term that appears in the Korean translation of Isaiah 53:2, which describes Jesus as one who \"\"grew up before him like a tender shoot\"\" ('soon is 'shoot' in Korean). Additionally, KCCC's small groups are called 'soons,' in which 'soon wons' (small group members) are discipled by 'soon jangs' (small group leaders). Using the word 'soon,' as part of the ministry's new name reflects the importance of discipleship in their movement.\n\nAlthough there were efforts to expand Korea Campus Crusade for Christ, Los Angeles, in the 80's and 90's, it was not until 1996 when Rev. Dong Whan Kim revitalized the organization and propelled it into one of the largest interdenominational Korean mission organizations in Southern California.\n\nOne of its prime ministries is the campus ministry that covers some of the largest college campuses in southern and northern California, including the University of California, Riverside, Santa Monica College, San Jose State University\n\nOther ministries include summer overseas mission trips where members are encouraged to participate in overseas missions to countries and regions including Thailand, Japan, Asia Minor, Cambodia, East Asia, Mongolia, Central Asia, Laos, South Africa and Hawaii for interstate mission. Activities during the mission may include cross-cultural events, teaching English to foreigners, showing films and performing Tae-Kwon-Do demonstrations and if circumstances are safe enough, proselytism. Since 1997, Korea Campus Crusade for Christ, Los Angeles, has been conducting annual summer mission trips that came to include upwards of 500 college students participating in the ministry as short-term missionaries.\n\nKCCC has a weekly prayer gathering every Friday at Dong Shin Church in Fullerton.\n\niMPACT is a dance ministry within KCCC. The team practices at KCCC Headquarters. iMPACT consists of members all over California from University of California Colleges, Cal State Universities, and Community Colleges. the director and coordinator was Jason Cheung. iMPACT's main performance is the annual Vision Conference, E-Crusade, and Korea Conference.\n\n"}
{"id": "1967552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967552", "title": "Business value", "text": "Business value\n\nIn management, business value is an informal term that includes all forms of value that determine the health and well-being of the firm in the long run. Business value expands concept of value of the firm beyond economic value (also known as economic profit, economic value added, and shareholder value) to include other forms of value such as employee value, customer value, supplier value, channel partner value, alliance partner value, managerial value, and societal value. Many of these forms of value are not directly measured in monetary terms.\n\nBusiness value often embraces intangible assets not necessarily attributable to any stakeholder group. Examples include intellectual capital and a firm's business model. The balanced scorecard methodology is one of the most popular methods for measuring and managing business value.\n\nThe concept of business value aligned with the theory that a firm is best viewed as a network of relationships both internal and external. These networks are sometimes called a value network or value chain. Each node in the network could be a stakeholder group, a resource, an organization, end-consumers, interest groups, regulators, or the environment itself. In a value network, value creation is viewed as a collaborative, creative, synergistic process rather than purely mechanistic or a result of command-and-control.\n\nIf the firm is viewed as a network of value creating entities, then the question becomes how does each node in the network contribute to overall firm performance and how does it behave and respond to its own interests. When the nodes are independent organizations (e.g., suppliers) or agents (e.g., customers), it is assumed that the firm is seeking a cooperative, win-win relationship where all parties receive value. Even when nodes in the network are not fully independent (e.g., employees), it is assumed that incentives are important and that those incentives go beyond direct financial compensation.\n\nWhile it would be very desirable to translate all forms of business value to a single economic measure (e.g., discounted cash flow), many practitioners and theorists believe this is either not feasible or theoretically impossible. Therefore, advocates of business value believe that the best approach is to measure and manage multiple forms of value as they apply to each stakeholder group.\n\nAs yet, there are no well-formed theories about how the various elements of business value are related to each other and how they might contribute to the firm's long-term success. One promising approach is the business model, but these are rarely formalized.\n\nPeter Drucker was an early proponent of business value as the proper goal of a firm, especially that a firm should create value for customers, employees (especially knowledge workers), and distribution partners. His management by objectives was a goal setting and decision-making tool to help managers at all levels create business value. However, he was skeptical that the dynamics of business value could ever be formalized, at least not with current methods.\n\nMichael Porter popularized the concept of the value chain.\n\nFor a publicly traded company, shareholder value is the part of its capitalization that is equity as opposed to long-term debt. In the case of only one type of stock, this would roughly be the number of outstanding shares times current share price. Things like dividends augment shareholder value while issuing of shares (stock options) lower it.\nThis shareholder value added should be compared to average/required increase in value, also known as cost of capital.\n\nFor a privately held company, the value of the firm after debt must be estimated using one of several valuation methods, s.a. discounted cash flow or others.\n\nCustomer value is the value received by the end-customer of a product or service. End-customer can include a single individual (consumer) or an organization with various individuals playing different roles in the buying/consumption processes. Customer value is conceived variously as utility, quality, benefits, and customer satisfaction.\n\nCustomer Value Management started by Ray Kordupleski in 1980s and discussed in his book: Mastering Customer Value Management and extended version of it is Total Customer Value Management modified by Gautam Mahajan and first exposed in his book: Customer Value Investement: Formula for Sustained Business Success and Total Customer Value Management.\n\nThis is often an undervalued asset in companies and also the area where there is the most discord in reporting. Employees are the most valuable asset companies possess and the one we expect the most from, but often the one that receives the short end of the stick when it comes to values applied to them.\n\nThe value a business underpins on partner relationships in the business. Partner value here stresses that it can be critical to a firms functioning. It ceases to exist or carry out business activities if partner value is diminished or lost.\n\nAn increase or decline in Business Value that an action produces is\ntraditionally measured in terms of Customer Satisfaction, Revenue Growth,\nProfitability, Market Share, Wallet Share, Cross-Sell Ratio,\nMarketing Campaign Response Rates, or Relationship Duration.\n\nVarious factors affect the business value impact of Information Technology (IT).\nThe most important factor is the alignment between IT and business processes, organization structure, and strategy. At the highest levels, this alignment is achieved through proper integration of enterprise architecture, business architecture, process design, organization design, and performance metrics.\n\nAt the level of computing and communications infrastructure, the following performance factors constrain and partially determine IT capabilities:\n\nThe term value-driven design was devised to describe the approach to planning business change (especially systems) based on the incremental improvements to business value - this is seen clearly in agile software development, where the goals of each iteration of product delivery are prioritised on what delivers highest business value drives.\n\nBusiness value is an informal concept and there is no consensus, either in academic circles or among management professionals, on its meaning or on its role in effective decision-making. The term could even be described as a \"buzz word\" used by various consultants, analyst firms, executives, authors, and academics.\n\nSome critics believe that measuring economic value, economic profit, or shareholder value is sufficiently complete to guide decision-making. They regard all other forms of value as essentially intermediate to the ultimate goal of economic profit. Furthermore, if they do not contribute to economic profit, they are actually a distraction for the firm.\n\nOther critics believe that extensive efforts to measure business value will be more of a distraction than a boon. For example, there is a fear that decision-makers will become confused if they have too many goals and measures that need to be accommodated.\n\n"}
{"id": "1967554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967554", "title": "Antigua", "text": "Antigua\n\nAntigua ( ), also known as Waladli or Wadadli by the native population, is an island in the West Indies. It is one of the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean region and the main island of the country of Antigua and Barbuda. Antigua and Barbuda became an independent state within the Commonwealth of Nations on 1 November 1981.\n\n\"Antigua\" means \"ancient\" in Spanish after an icon in Seville Cathedral, — St. Mary of the Old Cathedral. The name \"Waladli\" comes from the indigenous inhabitants and means approximately \"our own\". The island's circumference is roughly and its area . Its population was 80,161 (at the 2011 Census). The economy is mainly reliant on tourism, with the agricultural sector serving the domestic market.\n\nOver 32,000 people live in the capital city, St. John's. The capital is situated in the north-west and has a deep harbour which is able to accommodate large cruise ships. Other leading population settlements are All Saints (3,412) and Liberta (2,239), according to the 2001 census.\n\nEnglish Harbour on the south-eastern coast provides protected shelter during violent storms. It is the site of a restored British colonial naval station named \"Nelson's Dockyard\" after Admiral Horatio Nelson. English Harbour and the neighbouring village of Falmouth are yachting and sailing destinations and provisioning centres. During Antigua Sailing Week, at the end of April and beginning of May, an annual regatta brings a number of sailing vessels and sailors to the island to take part in sporting events.\n\nOn 6 September 2017, the Category 5 Hurricane Irma destroyed 90 percent of the buildings on the island of Barbuda and the entire population was evacuated to Antigua.\n\nThe first inhabitants were the Guanahatabey people. Eventually, the Arawak migrated from the mainland, followed by the Carib. Prior to European colonialism, Christopher Columbus was the first European to visit Antigua, in 1493.\n\nThe Arawak were the first well-documented group of indigenous people to settle Antigua. They paddled to the island by canoe (\"piragua\") from present-day Venezuela, pushed out by the Carib, another indigenous people. The Arawak introduced agriculture to Antigua and Barbuda. Among other crops, they cultivated the Antiguan \"Black\" pineapple. They also grew Corn, Sweet potatoes (white with firmer flesh than the bright orange \"sweet potato\" grown in the United States), Chili peppers, Guava, Tobacco, and Cotton.\n\nSome of the vegetables listed, such as corn and sweet potatoes, continue to be staples of Antiguan cuisine. Colonists took them to Europe, and from there, they spread around the world. For example, a popular Antiguan dish, \"dukuna\" (), is a sweet, steamed dumpling made from grated sweet potatoes, flour and spices. Another staple, \"fungi\" (), is a cooked paste made of cornmeal and water.\n\nMost of the Arawak left Antigua about A.D. 1100. Those who remained were raided by the Carib coming from Venezuela. According to \"The Catholic Encyclopedia\", the Caribs' superior weapons and seafaring prowess allowed them to defeat most Arawak nations in the West Indies. They enslaved some and cannibalised others. Watson points out that the Caribs had a much more warlike culture than the Arawak.\n\nThe indigenous people of the West Indies built excellent sea vessels, which they used to sail the Atlantic and Caribbean resulting in much of the South American and the Caribbean islands being populated by the Arawak and Carib. Their descendants live throughout South America, particularly Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nChristopher Columbus named the island \"Antigua\" in 1493 in honour of the \"Virgin of the Old Cathedral\" () found in Seville Cathedral in southern Spain. On his 1493 voyage, honouring a vow, he named many islands after different aspects of St. Mary, including Montserrat and Guadaloupe.\n\nIn 1632, a group of English colonists left St. Kitts to settle on Antigua. Sir Christopher Codrington, an Englishman, established the first permanent British settlement..Codrington Guided by Codrington, the island rapidly developed as a profitable sugar colony. For a large portion of Antigua history, the island was considered Britain's \"Gateway to the Caribbean\". It was located on the major sailing routes among the region's resource-rich colonies. Lord Horatio Nelson, a major figure in Antigua history, arrived in the late 18th century to preserve the island's commercial shipping prowess.\n\nAccording to \"A Brief History of the Caribbean\", British diseases, malnutrition and slavery eventually destroyed the vast majority of the Caribbean's native population. There are some differences of opinions as to the relative importance of these causes.\n\nSugar became Antigua's main crop in about 1674, when Christopher Codrington (c 1640-1698) settled at Betty's Hope plantation. He came from Barbados, bringing the latest sugar technology with him. Betty's Hope, Antigua's first full-scale sugar plantation, was so successful that other planters turned from tobacco to sugar. This resulted in their importing slaves to work the sugar cane crops.\n\nAccording to \"A Brief History of the Caribbean\", many West Indian colonists initially tried to use locals as slaves. These groups succumbed easily to disease and/or malnutrition, and died by the thousands. The enslaved Africans adapted better to the new environment and thus became the number one choice of unpaid labour; they also provided medical services and skilled labour, including carpentry, for their masters. However, according to a Smithsonian Institution article, the West African slave population in the Caribbean also had a high mortality rate, which was compensated by regular imports of very high numbers of new slaves from West and Central Africa.\n\nSugar cane was one of the most grueling and dangerous crops slaves were forced to cultivate. Harvesting cane required backbreaking long days in sugar cane fields under the hot island sun. Sugar cane spoiled quickly after harvest, and the milling process was slow and inefficient, forcing the mill and boiling house to operate 24 hours a day during harvest season. \n\nSugar mills and boiling houses were two of the most dangerous places for slaves to work on sugar plantations. In mills wooden or metal rollers were used to crush cane plants and extract the juices. Slaves were at risk of getting their limbs stuck and ripped off in the machines. Similarly, in sugar boiling houses slaves worked under extremely high temperatures and at the risk of being burned in the boiling sugar mixture or getting their limbs stuck.\n\nToday, collectors prize the uniquely designed colonial furniture built by West Indian slaves. Many of these works feature what are now considered \"traditional\" motifs, such as pineapples, fish and stylized serpents.\n\nBy the mid-1770s, the number of slaves had increased to 37,500, up from 12,500 in 1713. The British population had fallen from 5,000 to below 3,000. The slaves lived in wretched and overcrowded conditions and could be mistreated or even killed by their owners with impunity. The Slave Act of 1723 made arbitrary murder of slaves a crime, but did not do much to ease their lives.\n\nUnrest against enslavement among the Black Antiguans became increasingly common. In 1729, a man named Hercules was hanged, drawn, and quartered and three others were burnt alive, for conspiring to kill the slave owner Crump and his family. In 1736, an enslaved man called \"Prince Klaas\" (whose slave name was Court) allegedly planned an uprising in which British slavers would be massacred. Court was crowned \"King of the Coromantees\" in a pasture outside the capital of St. John's. The coronation appeared to be just a colourful spectacle but was, for the enslaved people, a ritual declaration of war on the British slavers. Due to information obtained from other slaves, colonists discovered the plot and suppressed it. Prince Klaas and four accomplices were caught and executed by the breaking wheel. (However, some doubts exist about Court's guilt.) Six of the rebels were hanged in chains and starved to death, and another 58 were burned at the stake. The site of these executions is now the Antiguan Recreation Ground.\n\nThe American War of Independence in the late 18th century disrupted the Caribbean sugar trade. At the same time, public opinion in Great Britain gradually turned against slavery. \"Traveling ... at slavery's end, [Joseph] Sturge and [Thomas] Harvey (1838 ...) found few married slaves residing together or even on the same estate. Slaveholders often counted as 'married' only those slaves with mates on the estate.\" Great Britain abolished the slave trade in 1807, and all existing slaves were emancipated in 1834.\n\nHoratio Nelson (who was created 1st Viscount Nelson in 1801) was Senior Naval Officer of the Leeward Islands from 1784 to 1787 on . During his tenure, he tried to enforce the Navigation Acts. These acts prohibited trade with the newly formed United States of America. Most of the merchants in Antigua depended upon American trade, so many of them despised Captain Nelson. As a result, he was unable to get a promotion for some time after his stint on the island.\n\nUnlike the Antiguan merchants, Nelson had a positive view of the controversial Navigation Acts:\n\nThe Americans were at this time trading with our islands, taking advantage of the register of their ships, which had been issued while they were British subjects. Nelson knew that, by the Navigation Act, no foreigners, directly or indirectly, are permitted to carry on any trade with these possessions. He knew, also, that the Americans had made themselves foreigners with regard to England; they had disregarded the ties of blood and language when they acquired the independence which they had been led on to claim, unhappily for themselves, before they were fit for it; and he was resolved that they should derive no profit from those ties now. Foreigners they had made themselves, and as foreigners they were to be treated.\nNelson said: \"The Antiguan Colonists are as great rebels as ever were in America, had they the power to show it.\"\n\nA dockyard started in 1725, to provide a base for a squadron of British ships whose main function was to patrol the West Indies and thus maintain Britain's sea power, was later named \"Nelson's Dockyard\" in his honour.\n\nWhile Nelson was stationed on Antigua, he frequently visited the nearby island of Nevis, where he met and married a young widow, Fanny Nisbet, who had previously married the son of a plantation family on Nevis.\n\nFollowing the foundation of the Ulotrichian Universal Union, a friendly society which acted as a trade union (which were banned), the sugar cane workers were ready to confront the plantation owners when they slashed their wages. The cane workers went on strike and rioted when their leaders were arrested.\n\nIn 1968, with Barbuda and the tiny island of Redonda as dependencies, Antigua became an associated state of the Commonwealth, and in 1981 it was disassociated from Britain.\n\nUntil July 7, 2015, the United States Air Force maintained a small base near the airport, designated Detachment 1, 45th Operations Group, 45th Space Wing (known as Antigua Air Station). The mission provided high rate telemetry data for the Eastern Range and its space launches. The unit was deactivated due to US government budget cuts and the property given to the Antiguan Government.\n\nCommissioned, 9 August 1956, the Naval Facility (NAVFAC) Antigua was one of the shore terminal stations that were part of the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) and the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS), which were used to track Soviet submarines. NAVFAC Antigua was decommissioned 4 February 1984.\n\nLocated in the Leeward Islands Antigua has an area of with of coastline. The highest elevation on the island is .\n\nVarious natural points, capes, and beaches around the island include: Boon Point, Beggars Point, Parham, Willikies, Hudson Point, English Harbour Town, Old Road Cape, Johnson's Point, Ffryes Point, Jennings, Five Islands, and Yepton Beach, and Runaway Beach.\n\nSeveral natural harbours are formed by these points and capes, including: Fitches Creek Bay, between Beggars Point and Parham; Nonsuch Bay between Hudson Point and Willikies; Willoughby Bay, between Hudson Point and English Harbour Town; English Harbour leading into English Harbour Town; Falmouth Harbour recessing into Falmouth; Rendezvous Bay between Falmouth and Old Road Cape; Five Islands Harbour, between Jennings and Five Islands; and Green Bay, the main harbour at St. John's, between Yepton Beach and Runaway Beach.\n\nLocal government is provided by six civil parishes: St. George, Saint Peter, Saint Philip, Saint Paul, Saint Mary, and Saint John.\n\nThe Antiguan racer is among the rarest snakes in the world. The Lesser Antilles are home to four species of racers. All four have undergone severe range reductions; at least two subspecies are extinct and another, \"A. antiguae\", now occupies only 0.1 percent of its historical range.\n\nGriswold's ameiva (\"Ameiva griswoldi\") is a species of lizard in the genus Ameiva. It is endemic to Antigua and Barbuda. It is found on both islands.\n\nThe country's official currency is the East Caribbean dollar. Given the dominance of tourism, many prices in tourist-oriented businesses are shown in US dollars. The EC dollar is pegged to the US dollar at a varied rate and averages about US$1 = EC$2.7.\n\nAntigua's economy relies largely on tourism, and the island is promoted as a luxury Caribbean escape. Many hotels and resorts are located around the coastline. The island's single airport, VC Bird Airport, is served by several major airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, British Airways, American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Caribbean Airlines, Air Canada, WestJet, LIAT, and JetBlue. There is regular air service to Barbuda.\n\nAntigua has two international primary/secondary schools: CCSET International, which offers the Ontario Secondary School Diploma, and Island Academy, which offers the International Baccalaureate. There are also many other private schools but these institutions tend to follow the same local curriculum (CXCs) as government schools.\n\nThe island of Antigua currently has two foreign-owned for-profit offshore medical schools, the American University of Antigua (AUA), founded in 2004, and The University of Health Sciences Antigua (UHSA), founded in 1982. The island's medical schools cater mostly to foreign students but contribute to the local economy and health care.\n\nAntigua was one of the very first nations to legalize, license, and regulate online gambling and is a primary location for incorporation of online gambling companies. Some countries, most notably the United States, argue that if a particular gambling transaction is initiated outside the country of Antigua then that transaction is governed by the laws of the country where the transaction was initiated. This argument was brought before World Trade Organization and was deemed incorrect.\n\nIn 2006, the United States Congress voted to approve the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act which criminalized the operations of offshore gambling operators which take wagers from American-based gamblers. This was a prima facie violation of the GATS treaty obligations enforced by the WTO, resulting in a series of rulings unfavorable to the US.\n\nOn 21 December 2007, an Article 22 arbitration panel ruled that the United States' failure to comply with WTO rules would attract a US$21 million sanction.\n\nThe WTO ruling was notable in two respects:\n\nFirst, although technically a victory for Antigua, the $21 million was far less than the US$3.5 billion which had been sought; one of the three arbitrators was sufficiently bothered by the propriety of this that he issued a dissenting opinion.\n\nSecond, a rider to the arbitration ruling affirmed the right of Antigua to take retaliatory steps in view of the prior failure of the US to comply with GATS. These included the rare, but not unprecedented, right to disregard intellectual property obligations to the US.\n\nAntigua's obligations to the US in respect of patents, copyright, and trademarks are affected. In particular, Berne Convention copyright is in question, and also material NOT covered by the Berne convention, including TRIPS accord obligations to the US. Antigua may thus disregard the WIPO treaty on intellectual property rights, and therefore the US implementation of that treaty (the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA)—at least up to the limit of compensation.\n\nSince there is no appeal to the WTO from an Arbitration panel of this kind, it represents the last legal word from the WTO on the matter. Antigua is therefore able to recoup some of the claimed loss of trade by hosting (and taxing) companies whose business model depends on immunity from TRIPS provisions.\n\nSoftware company SlySoft was based in Antigua, allowing it to avoid nations with laws that are tough on anti-circumvention of technological copyright measures, in particular the DMCA in the United States.\n\nSwiss American Bank Ltd., later renamed Global Bank of Commerce, Ltd, was formed in April 1983 and became the first Off-shore International Financial institution governed by the International Business Corporations, Act of 1982 licensed bank in Antigua. The bank was later sued by the United States for failure to release forfeited funds from one of its account holders. Swiss American Bank was founded by Bruce Rappaport.\n\nStanford International Bank was formed by Allen Stanford in 1986 in Montserrat where it was called Guardian International Bank. On 17 February 2009, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Allen Stanford, Laura Pendergest-Holt and James Davis with fraud in connection with the bank's US$8 billion certificate of deposit (CD) investment scheme that offered \"improbable and unsubstantiated high interest rates\". This led the federal government to freeze the assets of the bank and other Stanford entities. On 27 February 2009, Pendergest-Holt was arrested by federal agents in connection with the alleged fraud. On that day, the SEC said that Stanford and his accomplices operated a \"massive Ponzi scheme\", misappropriated billions of investors' money and falsified the Stanford International Bank's records to hide their fraud. \"Stanford International Bank's financial statements, including its investment income, are fictional,\" the SEC said.\n\nAntigua Overseas Bank (AOB) was part of the ABI Financial Group and was a licensed bank in Antigua. On 13 April 2012, AOB was placed into receivership by the government of Antigua.\n\nOn 27 November 2018, Scotiabank, the leading commercial bank on the island, announced plans to sell its banking operations in Antigua and 9 other non-core Caribbean markets to Republic Financial Holdings Limited.\n\nThe major Antiguan sport is cricket. Sir Vivian (\"Viv\") Richards is one of the most famous Antiguans, who played for, and captained, the West Indies cricket team. Richards scored the fastest Test century at the Antigua Recreation Ground, it was also the venue at which Brian Lara twice broke the world record for an individual Test innings (375 in 1993/94, 400 not out in 2003/04). Antigua was the location of a 2007 Cricket World Cup site, on a new Recreation Ground constructed on an old cane field in the north of the island. Both football (soccer) and basketball are becoming popular among the island youth. There are several golf courses in Antigua. Daniel Bailey was the first athlete to win a global world medal at the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships.\n\nBeing surrounded by water, sailing is one of the most popular sports with Antigua Sailing Week and Antigua Classic Yacht Regatta being two of the region's most reputable sailing competitions. Hundreds of yachts from around the world compete around Antigua each year. Sport Fishing is also a very popular sport with several big competitions held yearly. Windsurfing was very popular until kite-surfing came to the island. Kitesurfing or kite-boarding is very popular at Jabbawock Beach.\n\n\n\nExplanatory notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

She was seized by the Germans during the Second World War, and served several stints in the \"Kriegsmarine\". Having resumed her Hurtigruten service after the war until 1951, and in 1952 she was renamed \"Sylvia\". At the same year, she was transferred to the Royal Norwegian Navy, and served under the name HNoMS \"Valkyrien as a motor torpedo boat tender between 1953 and 1963.\n\nThe ship was built by Burmeister & Wain at Copenhagen for the Bergen Steamship Company. She was designed for their coastal service, and as a replacement for the ship \"Astraea\", which had sunk in January 1910. Named \"Polarlys\" (\"Aurora\"), the ship was launched on 10 January 1912, and delivered in April 1912.\n\nAt 1,069 gross register tons and 536 tons deadweight \"Polarlys\" was 208 feet long with 65 first class cabins, 32 second class, and 44 third class. Her triple expansion steam engines developed 1,473 IHP, and during sea trials she attained a maximum speed of 13.45 knots. She was refitted in 1930 and the number of cabins reduced.\n\n\"Polarlys\" was in Bergen on 9 April 1940 when the Germans captured the town and was soon taken over by the \"Kriegsmarine\" for use as an accommodation ship. They painted the name \"Satan\" on the ship, but was later changed to simply \"Tan\". She was returned to her owners in December 1940, but was requisitioned by the Germans once again in October and November 1944 for use as a troop transport as they retreated from northern Norway. In March 1945, the ship laid up at Stamnes in the Osterfjord and remained there until the end of the war in Europe.\n\nAfter a refit \"Polarlys\" returned to the coastal service in July 1945. However she was now showing her age, and was withdrawn from service on 12 October 1951. Laid up in Bergen, she was renamed \"Sylvia\" in April 1952, releasing the name for a new ship which was built in Ålborg same year.\n\nOn 1 July 1952 the ship was bought by the Royal Norwegian Navy, converted to a motor torpedo boat tender at the \"Bergen Mekaniske Verksted\" yard at Laksevåg, and was commissioned as \"Valkyrien\" in June 1953.\n\nIn connection with a rescue operation in 1956 in the Arctic the ship was outfitted with a Bell helicopter. She had a displacement of 1,500 tons and a top speed of . She had a crew of 76 and was armed with one 3-inch and three 40 mm guns.\n\nShe remained in naval service until 1963, and was sold for scrapping in Odense the following year.\n\nSS \"Polarlys\" was the backdrop of the first detective novel Georges Simenon (of Maigret fame) ever signed with his real name instead of a pseudonym. In this non-Maigret novel (French title \"Le Passager du Polarlys\") the ship's captain (whose character is not unlike Maigret) has to turn detective after a German police investigator has been murdered on board his ship, in connection with the drug-related death of a young model in the Montparnasse painters and drop-outs Parisian community of the roaring twenties. The whole story unfolds during the trip from Hamburg (then the start of the Bergen Steamship Company arm of the Hurtigruten) to the northern Hurtigruten terminal in Kirkenes where the criminal commits suicide by jumping overboard, while his female accomplice (and sister) attempts escape to Soviet Union (then without extradition agreements with capitalist western countries).\n"}

{"id": "1967558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967558", "title": "New York State Route 390", "text": "New York State Route 390\n\nNew York State Route 390 (NY 390) is a north–south state highway located along the western edge of the city of Rochester, New York, in the United States. The route, a limited-access northward continuation of Interstate 390 (I-390), extends for from I-490 in Gates to the Lake Ontario State Parkway in Greece, less than from the Lake Ontario shoreline. Between I-490 and NY 104, NY 390 makes up the north–south segment of the northwest quadrant of the Rochester Outer Loop, a series of expressways encircling Rochester. At NY 104, the Outer Loop departs NY 390 and follows NY 104 east into the city.\n\nThe freeway was constructed in stages from the 1960s to the 1980s, with the first segment—between I-490 and NY 31—opening to traffic . At the time, it was part of NY 47, which followed the completed portions of the Outer Loop from Gates to Irondequoit. An extension of the freeway north to U.S. Route 104 (US 104; now NY 104) was opened to traffic in the early 1970s. NY 47 was eliminated in 1980, giving way to NY 390 from I-490 to NY 104. NY 390 was extended to its current length in the early 1980s.\n\nNY 390 begins at the point where I-390 northbound crosses over I-490 eastbound in the center of a complex interchange between the two in Gates. Due to the setup of the junction, the northbound and southbound roadways, both two lanes wide, are initially set about apart. The highway heads through the remainder of the exit, passing over the left exit ramp from I-490 west to I-390 south heading northbound and under the ramp linking I-490 east to NY 390 north southbound and crossing over I-490 westbound. North of the junction, the median narrows to a more standard width as NY 390 widens to six lanes and connects to NY 31 (Lyell Avenue). The expressway proceeds north through neighborhoods equally residential and industrial, crossing over both the former right-of-way of the CSX Transportation-owned Falls Road Secondary Track and the Erie Canal prior to meeting Lexington Avenue via a modified trumpet interchange.\nFrom Lexington Avenue, where NY 390 passes into the town of Greece, north to NY 104, NY 390 runs parallel to the western edge of Eastman Business Park, the large production and distribution complex owned and maintained by Eastman Kodak. Midway between the Lexington Avenue and West Ridge Road exits, NY 390 encounters Ridgeway Avenue via a partial diamond interchange. Just north of Ridgeway Avenue, the expressway crosses a small, narrow strip of land that lies within the Rochester city limits, a carryover from when the Erie Canal occupied this tract and entered the city decades before. North of the strip, NY 390 curves to the northeast, passing along the west side of the industrial park and the eastern edge of a residential yet wooded area to reach NY 104. Heading northbound, it splits into two halves, with exit 24A connecting to NY 104 east and exit 24B linking to NY 104 west.\n\nPast NY 104, the roadway surface shifts from pavement to concrete as the freeway heads generally northward through primarily residential neighborhoods. This section northwards to the Lake Ontario State Parkway is designated the \"Assemblyman Roger J. Robach Memorial Lakeway\" by state law. The next exit, with Vintage Lane to the north-northeast of NY 104, is the highway's last as a six-lane freeway. Here, it narrows to four lanes—two in both directions—before continuing onward to meet NY 18 (Latta Road) at a conventional diamond interchange. At this point, all commercial vehicles are forced to exit NY 390 due to a similar restriction on the Lake Ontario State Parkway to the north. Outside of a small pocket of development near Greece Arcadia High and Middle Schools, the remainder of the freeway crosses open, sparsely developed areas of Greece. NY 390 curves to the northeast for its final before ending at a trumpet interchange with the parkway from the shore of Lake Ontario.\n\nThe segment of the Rochester Outer Loop between NY 33A and NY 31 was completed . It was originally designated as part of NY 47, which had followed the parallel Howard Road to the west prior to the freeway's construction. Work on an extension north to US 104 (now NY 104) began in the mid-1960s and was completed in the early 1970s. The freeway officially became part of NY 47 on January 1, 1970, when the route was extended northward over the then-proposed Outer Loop to a new terminus at the Lake Ontario State Parkway. In actuality, however, NY 47 never extended any farther north than NY 104, which served as the freeway's northern terminus throughout the 1970s.\nIn the late 1970s, the state of New York submitted a proposal to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that would substantially alter how the Outer Loop was numbered. As part of the plan, the NY 47 designation would be eliminated while the northwestern section of the Outer Loop—from I-490 in Gates to the proposed northern terminus at the Lake Ontario Parkway in Greece—would become the northernmost part of I-390. Most of the proposed changes took effect on March 18, 1980, when NY 47 was eliminated; however, I-390 was modified to end at its junction with I-490. In its place, the Gates–Greece leg of the Outer Loop was assigned NY 390. The NY 390 designation was extended northward to its current terminus in the early 1980s when the segment of the Outer Loop between NY 104 and the Lake Ontario State Parkway was completed.\n\nThe highway began experiencing dramatic increases in traffic, especially after the highway was extended to the Lake Ontario State Parkway post 1980’s. As Greece and towns on the northwest side of Rochester have expanded, NY-390 emerged as the primary highway link southward. The interchange of NY/I-390 and I-490 currently serves over 200,000 cars daily — compared to 25,000 when it was designed and opened in the 1960s — and regularly has heavy congestion during the morning and evening rush hours. Major slowdowns on 390 are often influenced by the interchange at 490 and Lyell Avenue.\n\nStarting in 2010, the New York State Department of Transportation began soliciting ideas on how to improve the junction. The overall project includes four phases, with $150 million in state and federal funding. The project launched in May 2017, with the replacement of the (NY-31) Lyell Avenue Bridge (which was completed in July 2018).\n\n"}

She served as the inaugural First Lady of Botswana from 1966 to 1980.\n\nLady Khama was born Ruth Williams in Meadowcourt Road, Blackheath in south London. She was the daughter of George and Dorothy Williams. Her father had served as a captain in the British Army in India, and later worked in the tea trade. She had a sister, Muriel Williams-Sanderson, with whom she remained close.\n\nShe was educated at Eltham Hill Grammar School and then served as a WAAF ambulance driver at various airfields in the south of England during the Second World War. After the war, she worked as a clerk for Cuthbert Heath, a firm of underwriters at Lloyd's of London.\n\nIn June 1947, at a dance at Nutford House organised by the London Missionary Society, her sister introduced her to the then Prince Seretse Khama. He was the son of the paramount chief Sekgoma II of the Bamangwato people, and was studying law at Inner Temple in London after a year at Balliol College, Oxford. The couple were both fans of jazz music, particularly The Ink Spots, and quickly fell in love. Their plans to marry caused controversy both with the tribal elders in Bechuanaland and the government of South Africa, which had recently instituted the system of racial segregation known as apartheid.\n\nThe British government intervened in an attempt to stop the marriage. The Bishop of London, William Wand, said he would permit a church wedding only if the government agreed. The couple married at Kensington register office in September 1948. Daniel Malan, Prime Minister of South Africa, described their marriage as \"nauseating\". Julius Nyerere, then a student teacher and later President of Tanzania, said it was \"one of the great love stories of the world\".\n\nThe couple returned to Bechuanaland, then a British protectorate, where Seretse's uncle Tshekedi Khama was regent. After receiving popular support in Bechuanaland, Seretse was called to London in 1950 for discussions with British officials. He was prevented from returning home and told he had to remain in exile. Ruth joined him in England and the married couple lived as exiles from 1951, living in Croydon.\n\nPopular support and protest continued in Bechuanaland. The couple were permitted to return in 1956 after the Bamangwato people sent a telegram to Queen Elizabeth II. Seretse renounced his tribal throne, and became a cattle farmer in Serowe.\n\nSeretse founded the nationalist Bechuanaland Democratic Party and won the 1965 general election. As prime minister of Bechuanaland, he pushed for independence, which was granted in 1966. Seretse Khama became the first president of independent Botswana, and he became a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Lady Khama was an influential, politically active First Lady during her husband's four consecutive terms as president from 1966 to 1980.\n\nLady Khama and her husband had four children. Their first child Jacqueline was born in Bechuanaland in 1950, shortly after Seretse was exiled. Their first son Ian was born in England in 1953, and twins Anthony and Tshekedi were born in Bechuanaland in 1958 (Anthony was named after Tony Benn, then known as Anthony Wedgwood Benn, who supported their return from exile in the early 1950s). She remained in Botswana after her husband's death in office in 1980, receiving recognition as \"\"Mohumagadi Mma Kgosi\"\" (mother of the chief, or queen mother). Despite the national controversy surrounding their union in the 1940s and 1950s, the couple were inseparable until his death from cancer in 1980. After her husband's death, she lived on a large farm in Botswana, dedicating her time and efforts to charitable causes and spending time with her children and grandchildren.\n\nTwo of their sons, Ian and Tshekedi, have become prominent politicians in Botswana. Ian Khama was elected as the President of Botswana in 2008.\n\nLady Khama died of throat cancer in Gaborone at the age of 78, survived by her four children. She was buried in Botswana next to her husband.\n\nA film, \"A Marriage of Inconvenience\", based on the Michael Dutfield book with same name, was made in 1990 about the Khamas. A book, \"Colour Bar\", has been published about the Khamas' relationship and struggles. In addition, it has also been suggested that the experiences of the Khamas, as well as the somewhat contemporary case of 1950s debutante Peggy Cripps' marriage to the African anti-colonialist Nana Joe Appiah, influenced the writing of the Oscar-winning feature film, \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\".\n\nLady Khama is portrayed by Rosamund Pike in the 2016 film \"A United Kingdom\" directed by Amma Asante.\n\n"}

{"id": "1967564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967564", "title": "New York State Route 590", "text": "New York State Route 590\n\nNew York State Route 590 (NY 590) is a north–south state highway located in the eastern suburbs of Rochester, New York, in the United States. The route is a limited-access northward extension of Interstate 590 (I-590) that begins at the Can of Worms, an interchange between I-490, I-590, and NY 590 on the boundary between the town of Brighton and the city of Rochester, and ends at a roundabout with Titus Avenue in the town of Irondequoit. NY 590 is known as the Sea Breeze Expressway, a name derived from the small community of Sea Breeze located near the highway's former northern terminus at Culver Road near the southern shore of Lake Ontario.\n\nThe portion of NY 590 between the Can of Worms and NY 104 is part of the northeastern quadrant of the Rochester Outer Loop, a series of expressways that form a beltway around the city of Rochester. At NY 104, the Outer Loop turns west to follow NY 104 through Irondequoit. The Sea Breeze Expressway was built in stages from the 1950s to the 1960s and carried various designations until 1970, when the entirety of the Rochester – Sea Breeze highway was designated as part of NY 47. It was redesignated as NY 590 in 1980. In the late 2000s, the section of NY 590 north of Titus Avenue was reconfigured into a two-lane road named Sea Breeze Drive, and NY 590 was truncated to end at Titus Avenue.\n\nThe four-lane I-590 becomes NY 590 upon passing under I-490 at the Can of Worms on the eastern edge of Rochester. It heads northeast into Brighton and through the remainder of the interchange, passing under the ramp connecting I-490 west to I-590 south, the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision, and the ramps from NY 590 south to I-490 in succession before widening to six lanes and turning northward ahead of a diamond interchange with Blossom Road, once designated as NY 286A. Between Blossom Road and NY 286 (Browncroft Boulevard), NY 590 slowly turns to the northwest, passing through densely populated neighborhoods located adjacent to the Rochester–Brighton boundary. It reaches the city line and reenters Rochester upon meeting NY 286.\n\nThe lone portion of NY 590 within the city of Rochester runs due north–south, acting as a divider between residential neighborhoods to the west and the Irondequoit Creek valley (much of which is part of Ellison Park) to the east. Little more than a half mile after entering the city, NY 590 exits the city and enters the neighboring town of Irondequoit. Here, the freeway turns to the northwest to avoid the area surrounding the intersection of North Winton Road and NY 404 (Empire Boulevard). After passing under North Winton Road, NY 590 resumes its northward trek and connects to NY 404 by way of a modified cloverleaf interchange. The expressway continues onward, separating a large residential area from Irondequoit Bay Park West as it progresses toward a northbound-only exit with Norton Street. One half-mile to the north of Norton, NY 590 meets NY 104 via a large interchange.\nDue to the terrain surrounding the interchange and the location of the Irondequoit Bay Bridge, NY 104 is forced to run parallel to NY 590 for a short distance between the Keeler Street Expressway and NY 590's next exit, a diamond interchange connecting to East Ridge Road. Through this stretch, NY 590—now just four lanes wide—runs in between NY 104 westbound and NY 104 eastbound. At East Ridge Road, NY 104 turns to the northeast to cross Irondequoit Bay while NY 590 continues north through residential areas toward Sea Breeze. The road has an at-grade intersection with Sunrise Crescent, a private residential street, before meeting Titus Avenue at a roundabout that serves as NY 590's northern terminus. Past this point, the right-of-way of NY 590 continues north to Culver Road at the Lake Ontario shoreline as a divided two-lane street named Sea Breeze Drive.\n\nTraveling southbound on NY 590, two significant movements are restricted due to the composition of the expressway. One is at Blossom Road in Brighton, where traffic entering NY 590 southbound cannot access I-490 due to the location of the exit 5 (left exit) flyover, which begins north of the Blossom Road onramp. This movement was possible prior to the reconstruction of the Can of Worms, as the original connection point between the Sea Breeze Expressway and I-490 was south of the Blossom Road interchange. In Irondequoit, there are no southbound exits between East Ridge Road and NY 404; thus, there is no access to either NY 104 or Norton Street. An access road between NY 590 at Titus Avenue and the Irondequoit Bay Bridge was planned to provide access from NY 590 southbound to NY 104 eastbound and from NY 104 westbound to NY 590 northbound, but it was never completed.\n\nThe origins of NY 590 date back to the start of the 1950s when work first began on the Sea Breeze Expressway, a part-divided highway, part limited-access highway that extended from Rochester north to the Lake Ontario shoreline at Sea Breeze. The highway was built in stages from north to south, with the first section—a divided highway connecting Culver Road to East Ridge Road in Irondequoit—opening to traffic in the early 1950s as a realignment of NY 18. The northern end of the roadway was situated just west of the Irondequoit Bay outlet, where Irondequoit Bay meets Lake Ontario. Construction on the next segment, a limited-access extension south to Empire Boulevard (U.S. Route 104 or US 104), began in the mid-1950s. The new roadway was completed in the late 1950s, at which time it became part of a rerouted US 104.\nBy 1960, construction was underway on the final piece, a second extension south to the Eastern Expressway (I-490) in eastern Rochester. The under-construction highway generally paralleled Winton Road, then designated as part of NY 47. The new extension was completed , but went unnumbered until when NY 47 was realigned north of Blossom Road to follow the expressway north to the Empire Boulevard interchange, where it ended at US 104. The remainder of the Sea Breeze Expressway from I-490 to Blossom Road became part of NY 47 following the completion of what is now I-590 from the Can of Worms to Elmwood Avenue.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1980, the Sea Breeze Expressway underwent a series of designation changes. On January 1, 1970, NY 47 was extended northward to encompass the entirety of the Sea Breeze Expressway. The change resulted in overlaps with US 104 from Empire Boulevard to the new Keeler Street Expressway, which was built south of Ridge Road in the late 1960s as a realignment of US 104, and NY 18 from East Ridge Road to Culver Road, from where NY 18 continued east along Lake Road to Webster. Both overlaps proved to be temporary: US 104 was realigned to cross Irondequoit Bay on the Irondequoit Bay Bridge while NY 18 was truncated to end in Rochester's Kodak Park.\nIn the late 1970s, the state of New York submitted a proposal to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that would substantially alter how the Outer Loop was numbered. As part of the plan, the NY 47 designation would be eliminated while most of the northeastern section of the Outer Loop—from I-490 in Rochester to NY 104 (former US 104) to Irondequoit—would become the northernmost part of I-590. A replacement designation for NY 47 north of NY 104 was not named at the time. Most of the proposed changes took effect on March 18, 1980, when NY 47 was eliminated; however, I-590 was modified to end at its junction with I-490. In its place, the Rochester–Irondequoit leg of the Outer Loop was assigned NY 590, which continued north to Sea Breeze over former NY 47.\n\nIn 1995, Irondequoit Town Supervisor David Schantz proposed the idea of converting the portion of NY 590 north of Titus Avenue into a parkway that would serve as a \"gateway\" into Irondequoit. He presented the idea to Jim Walsh, the United States Representative representing Irondequoit, who later secured $8 million from the federal government for the project. Another $4.5 million of funding was also devoted to the project from the state of New York. Planning for the project began in mid-2004. In late 2006, the Irondeqout Town Board chose a configuration calling for the number of lanes on NY 590 to be reduced to two and for four intersections to be replaced with roundabouts as its \"preferred alternative\".\n\nThe final project design was presented on February 6, 2008, in the last of five public meetings on the project. Under the plan, the section of NY 590 north of Titus Avenue would be reduced to a two-lane, parkway and named \"Sea Breeze Drive\". Its signalized intersections with Titus Avenue, Durand Boulevard, and Seneca and Point Pleasant Roads would be converted into roundabouts as part of the reconstruction. Also, the portion of NY 590 north of Durand Boulevard would be realigned to meet Culver Road at a new intersection farther west along the lakeshore. The realignment would open up of waterfront land along the shore of Irondequoit Bay that had previously been occupied by the expressway. The town of Irondequoit would then acquire the former right-of-way of NY 590 from the state of New York for future recreational uses in a transaction that would officially cost the town $1.\nPublic opinion on the proposed project was split. Many residents supported the project, stating it would improve the safety of the highway; however, others believed that the reduction in lanes would result in increased traffic on Culver Road, which runs parallel to NY 590 through Irondequoit, and that the roundabouts would make navigating the highway difficult.\n\nOn July 15, 2008, the town of Irondequoit let a $12.8 million contract for the Sea Breeze Drive project, a mark that was within the $14 million accumulated in funding by this time. Ground was officially broken on the project on July 28 as part of a ceremony attended by several Rochester-area dignitaries. Among those present were Jim Walsh and David Schantz, both of whom played large roles in making the project a reality. The corridor was subsequently reduced to two lanes as the southbound lanes of NY 590 were reconfigured to handle both directions of traffic while work ensued on permanently narrowing the northbound lanes to a single lane. Northbound traffic on NY 590 was realigned to use the new northbound lane on August 17, 2009.\n\nThe first two of the roundabouts to reach operational status were those at Point Pleasant Road and Durand Boulevard. The Point Pleasant Road roundabout opened to traffic on September 8, 2009, by which time the Durand Boulevard roundabout was also ready for use. The Titus Avenue roundabout was completed in late 2009, while work on the Seneca Road junction was delayed until October 2009 due to the proximity of the intersection to the side of the hill overlooking Irondequoit Bay. Although the original plans for the project had already accounted for the issue, the plans had to be revised to comply with new federal standards regarding the use of steel pilings for supporting the hillside. Work on the roundabout finally began on October 12. The Seneca Road roundabout and the new alignment of Sea Breeze Drive north of Durand Boulevard were completed in the first half of 2010.\nThe completion date for the project, dubbed \"the largest public works project ever done in the town of Irondequoit\" by then-Town Supervisor Mary Ellen Heyman, was pushed back several times. It was originally set for May 2010, but was subsequently pushed back to late August or early September. It was finally completed in October 2010 with the installation of a decorative ship mast structure at the Durand Boulevard roundabout. Following the project's completion, NY 590 was truncated to Titus Avenue and ownership and maintenance of Sea Breeze Drive was transferred to the town of Irondequoit. According to New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) official Rick Papaj, the state turned Sea Breeze Drive over to the town because the portion of NY 590 north of Titus Avenue had low traffic volumes and was situated in a residential area. Papaj added, \"[the portion of NY 590 north of Titus Avenue] didn't make sense (to us) anymore. 590 effectively ends at Route 104.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1967576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967576", "title": "Clos de Vougeot", "text": "Clos de Vougeot\n\nClos de Vougeot, also known as Clos Vougeot, is a wall-enclosed vineyard, a \"clos\", in the Burgundy wine region, and an \"Appellation d'origine contrôlée\" (AOC) for red wine from this vineyard. It was named for the River Vouge, which is in fact only a stream separating the village Vougeot from Chambolle-Musigny. At , Clos de Vougeot is the largest single vineyard in Côte de Nuits entitled to the grand cru designation, while Corton in Côte de Beaune is the largest grand cru in Burgundy as a whole.\n\nThe Clos de Vougeot vineyard was created by Cistercian monks of Cîteaux Abbey, the order's mother abbey. The land making up the vineyard was purchased by the Cistercians, or donated to them, from the 12th century to the early 14th century. The initial vineyard consisted of donations in 1109 to 1115. The vineyard was complete, and a wall had been built around it, by the year 1336. It served as the flagship vineyard of the Cistercians, and has been a highly recognised name for centuries.\n\nChâteau du Clos de Vougeot, situated inside the wall, was added in 1551 by rebuilding and enlarging a small chapel and some other buildings previously existing at the site. From 1945, this building has served as headquarters of the Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin.\n\nIn the French Revolution, all vineyard possessions were taken from the church by the French state, and sold off to private buyers. In 1818, the château and vineyards of Clos de Vougeot was bought by Julien-Jules Ouvrard, who also bought the Romanée-Conti vineyard in 1819. Ouvrard later moved to Château de Gilly, another former Cistercian property, but continued to take in an interest in the vineyards of Clos de Vougeot, which was then a monopole. After Ouvrard's death, Clos de Vougeot passed to his three heirs, but continued to be operated as a single property until 1889, when the heirs put it up for sale. It was bought by six Burgundy wine merchants, leading to a subdivided vineyard for the first time since its creation more than 700 years earlier. After that, the holdings have been progressively subdivided by inheritance and land sales. In the early 2000s, Clos de Vougeot was split among more than 80 owners.\n\nOne of the 1889 vineyard buyers, Léonce Bocquet, also bought the château, and initiated renovations of a part of it. In 1920, the château came into the hands of Etienne Camuzet, who was vineyard owner in Vosne-Romanée and politician. He put it to the disposal of the Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin, and on November 29, 1944 sold it to the organisation \"Société civile des Amis du Château du Clos de Vougeot\" (\"Friends of the Château du Clos de Vougeot\"), which gave the Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin a 99-year lease on the property.\n\nThe vineyard is roughly rectangular, gently sloping from a corner in the northwest down toward the south and east. The château is situated in this corner. Since the vineyard is large and situated in a slope, it is not homogeneous from a geological point of view. The soils have typically been a determining factor in determining the classification and extent of other Burgundy vineyards, while in this case, the wall-enclosed area has been classified in the same way.\n\nThe soils of Clos de Vougeot generally considered as those giving the best wines are those surrounding the château in the top corner. The soils here are light chalky and gravelly soils on oolitic limestone, with good drainage. This part of the vineyard borders to the grand cru vineyards Musigny and Grands Échezeaux.\n\nThe soils of the middle part of the vineyard consist of softer limestone with clay and some gravel, and moderate drainage. Most other Côte de Nuits vineyards situated at this level of the slope are classified premier cru, but one part of the grand cru Échezeaux borders on the middle part of Clos de Vougeot.\n\nThe bottom part of the vineyard, situated in the east and bordering the N74, the main road of the area, consists of humus-rich alluvial clay and is almost flat, with poor drainage. This part of the vineyard borders village level vineyards in the south and partially in the east, mostly regional-level vineyards in the east, on the other side of the N74, and some Vougeot premier cru vineyards in the north. All other grand cru vineyards of the Côte de Nuits are situated higher up in the slope, typically in its middle part, and no other grand cru vineyard stretch down to the N74 road.\n\nOf the AOC's 50.6 ha, are in production.\n\nClos de Vougeot is an AOC for red wine produced from Pinot noir. The INAO appellation rules nevertheless makes it allowed to mix in up to 15 percent of Pinot blanc, Pinot gris or Chardonnay. In principle, wines from any still existing plantations of Renevey are also allowed, but replantation of this variety has been forbidden since 1938.\n\nThe allowed base yield is 35 hectoliter per hectare. The grapes must reach a maturity corresponding to a sugar content of at least 189 grams per liter of grape must and 11.5 per cent alcohol by volume. When chaptalization is allowed, the alcohol level after chaptalization may not exceed 14.5 per cent.\n\nWines from Clos de Vougeot are also allowed the appellation Vougeot Premier Cru, if they fail to meet the standards of the grand cru itself. The Vougeot Premier Cru regulations are slightly less restrictive when it comes to yield and grape maturity, and more importantly, also allow the production of white wine from Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc. Thus, white wine that originate from within the Clos de Vougeot vineyard can be sold as white Vougeot Premier Cru, but not under the Clos de Vougeot AOC.\n\nBoth the geological heterogeneity of Clos de Vougeot, and the bewildering array of many small vineyard holders, contribute to making wines produced under the Clos de Vougeot AOC designation very variable in style and quality. Very fine wine of classic quality as well as very mediocre wines are produced here.\n\nThe wines of Clos de Vougeot rose to fame when the Cistercians tended the entire vineyard and produced the wine. In producing Clos de Vougeot, the Cistercians first produced cuvées from the different parts of the vineyard, and then blended them to produce a high-class wine. Typically, wine from the top and middle parts would be used, and only sometimes would the bottom part be used for the final Clos de Vougeot wine. Wine from lower down the slope can be better in dry years, so this blending practice allowed the production of a wine that should have been consistent in quality.\n\nSince the entire area inside the wall is part of the Clos de Vougeot AOC, wines from every plot of it is entitled to the grand cru designation. Wineries which only have holdings in the lower part of the vineyard are unlikely to be able to produce wine which represents typical Burgundy grand cru quality, and it is far from certain that they will be able to match many producers' premier cru wines. However, since the grand cru designation is both a matter of pride and profitability, wines are likely to be marketed as Clos de Vougeot AOC.\n\nThe best Clos de Vougeot wines, when produced in a classical style, are typically dense when young, and robust rather than elegant in style. After some ten years of cellaring, however, Clos de Vougeot wines in this style can have developed into one of the most complete Côte de Nuits wines, and be fully on par with wines from more consistent grand cru vineyards.\n\nSome notable producers of Clos de Vougeot wine are Domaine Leroy, Mugneret-Gibourg, Méo-Camuzet, Anne Gros and René Engel.\n\nClos de Vougeot 1846 was the featured wine in the film \"Babette's Feast\", which is set in 1871.\n\n\"Clos Vougeot\" is the preferred restorative of Miserrimus Dexter, a character in Wilkie Collins' 1875 novel, \"The Law and the Lady\".\n\nIn Edgar Allan Poe's \"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\" (1845), Clos de Vougeot is the wine being drunk at the lunatics' feast. It is also mentioned in Poe's Bon-Bon.\n\nClos de Vougeot makes an appearance in Dorothy Sayers' short story \"The Bibulous Business of a Matter of Taste\", where it is one of the wines that Lord Peter Wimsey must identify from memory.\n\nThe Château du Clos de Vougeot is featured on a 1951 French stamp, designed and engraved by Pierre Gandon, to celebrate its 400th anniversary.\n"}
{"id": "1967578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967578", "title": "Penance (X-Men)", "text": "Penance (X-Men)\n\nHollow (formerly called Penance) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It is an apparently mindless body which three members of the St Croix family, all members of the superhero team Generation X, had been trapped in at some time. The body possesses red diamond-like skin and rarely speaks.\n\nPenance first appeared in \"Generation X\" #1 (November, 1994), and was created by Scott Lobdell and Chris Bachalo.\n\nHollow appeared as a supporting character in \"Avengers Academy\" beginning with issue #21 (Jan 2012), making occasional appearances throughout the series.\n\nMonet St. Croix is the sister of Marius, Claudette, and Nicole St. Croix. When her brother Marius, who would later become the mutant Emplate, first manifests his powers, the conceited Monet often verbally abused him. An enraged Emplate transforms her body into a hardened, spiked, red state and left her mute. He then tells her to \"consider this your penance\". Claudette, realizing how dangerous their brother is becoming, banishes him to his own pocket dimension, but he convinces Monet to accompany him, as only he can restore her true form. Nicole and Claudette, knowing Monet was their parents' favorite, decide to merge into one body with the appearance of Monet (\"see\" Monet-twins).\n\nShortly after the formation of the mutant teen team Generation X, the red-skinned Monet is dropped onto the front lawn of the Massachusetts Academy by Gateway, who speaks the single word: \"Penance,\" which is taken by witnesses to be her name. She is brought inside by headmaster Banshee, who discovers her powers as he cuts his hands by trying to pick her up As Penance cannot speak, understand English (apparently), and with an immunity to telepathy, Banshee places her in the infirmary as Banshee and Emma Frost attempt to discover her identity. Teen member M, her relation to Penance unknown, tells the adults that Penance was perhaps a prisoner of Emplate, whom the group had encountered previously and known only as a parasitic mutant who fed upon other mutants.\n\nAs the team leaves, Penance awakens with one thought on her mind: survival. Perceiving the infirmary as a cell, she escapes, tearing the room apart in the process. Hearing the alarms of a breach, the team rushes to the infirmary and is amazed at the damage she caused. The team splits up to find her before she can cause further damage to the Academy. Team member Chamber, feeling a kindred spirit due to his own mutilated body, leaves the group to search for her alone. Feeling that another deformed soul would seek him out, he waited for her arrival. After Penance fights her way past the rest of the team (Husk, Synch, Jubilee, and M), she approaches Chamber, who talks telepathically to her in an attempt to convince her that he knows how she feels and eventually calms the girl down into staying with the team.\n\nDuring her stay at the Academy, she would rarely interact with her peers, due to her animalistic nature from years of torture at Emplate's hands, and fear of being captured again. Fortunately, perhaps due to Jubilee's time with the feral mutant Wolverine, she becomes a friend to Penance, giving her the nickname \"Penny\". Gradually beginning to trust her friends more, Penance begins to go on missions with and assist her teammates. However, while swimming with Jubilee one day, Penance suddenly has what resembles a seizure, falling into a mysterious coma that makes Jubilee and the others realize how little they truly know about her. Penance later recovers, off-panel, without explanation shortly after an attack by Omega Red.\n\nEmplate later returns to reclaim Penance, and while she is captured with the rest of Generation X, her allegiance is momentarily unclear. Curiously enough, it is during these events that Emplate reveals he is Monet's older brother, also implying that he now realizes the twins are posing as Monet. He refers to Penance for the first time as \"Yvette\", although this name would eventually be retconned. Penance eventually sides with Generation X and attacks Emplate, leading to his retreat.\n\nDuring the events of , Generation X is attacked by Prime Sentinels in Skin's hometown of east Los Angeles. During the battle, Monet urges Synch to synch with her invulnerability to ensure his survival. In the process, he realizes that she is actually two girls, shortly before they are buried under debris. Synch rescues her, only to discover that his teammate has now split back into the unconscious forms of Nicole and Claudette. \n\nThe mystery of the twins and Monet would remain unsolved until Emplate again returned, this time working with Chimera and seeking to claim the twins. The twins recover during the battle, joining to become Monet again, and then joining with Emplate against his will to become M-Plate, an entirely new being with plans of its own: namely, to journey to the Citadel of the Universal Amalgamator and force Synch to synch with the Guardian there, thereby combining all life into a single consciousness. Generation X prevents this, thanks largely to unlikely ally Dirtnap, who not only swallows M-Plate whole, but soon after explodes, restoring Emplate and the twins to their separate bodies. However, during their time as one entity, their secrets were exposed to each other, and the twins now know what truly happened to Monet. Synch is later seriously injured by two bullies, and while recovering in the hospital, he accidentally synchs with the twins, learning the truth about the twins and Monet in the process. He urges Nicole to reveal the truth to the team, which she does. But in an effort to \"make things right\", the twins merge once more into the form of Monet and swap places with Penance, freeing the real Monet at last, with the merged twins taking over as Penance's body.\n\nMonet continues to operate under the twins' original codename of M, while the twins retain the identity of Penance. Both remain a part of the Generation X team, while still trying to somehow cure the still mute Penance. Notably, Penance becomes far more expressive during this period, and begins wearing everyday clothing over the black restraints she had worn since her creation. Later, an explosion frees the twins from the Penance body, but the body would continue to function as though a mind is still inside it.\n\nWhen the twins leave for their home, they take the now-empty Penance body with them, along with the young mutants Artie Maddicks and Leech.\n\nAfter Ricochet breaks into a building holding women being used to harvest Mutant Growth Hormone. There he meets an assassin named Delilah. During the fight, one of Ricochets discs break open a chamber and Penance emerges. At first confused as to where she is, Penance tries to convince Ricochet that she isn't a threat, though he is forced to avoid her claws. Lightspeed (following Ricochet out of concern) lands between the two and uses her Kymellian powers to mesmerize Penance, but when she places her hand on Penance's shoulder, she stabs Lightspeed through her shoulders. Later, Penance encounters the rest of the group at the hospital where Julie is recovering. It is then she senses a kindred spirit in Phil Urich. She is followed by the ones intent on imprisoning her, including a mysterious woman named Fuyumi Fujikawa who calls her \"Hollow\". Mickey Musashi's makes a deal with the woman that allows Hollow to remain with the group, and which allows her to stay at Phil's residence.\n\nWhile Phil is in the kitchen washing dishes. She is woken up by the sound of him smashing plates when he hallucinates an image of himself as the Green Goblin, kissing her, and tries to comfort him. After an attack by Nekra, Penance witness Phil become irrational when he sees Chris and Mickey share a celebratory kiss after attack. Later, she follows Phil to Mickey's apartment. After Phil steals the Darkhawk amulet, Hollow joins the other Loners in the battle between Phil, who is wearing the Darkhawk armor and Chris, who managed to summon his second Darkhawk armor. After the fight, she joins the defeated Phil who leaves the group.\n\nIt is still unknown who is inside the armor.\n\nMonet St. Croix is mentioned when her brother Emplate attacks Utopia, under her former codename.\n\nPenance/Hollow (along with most of the members from the Loners) was seen among the new students attending the Avengers Academy.\n\nThe original creative team behind \"Generation X\", Scott Lobdell and Chris Bachalo, intended Penance to be a girl called Yvette from Yugoslavia. This was never directly revealed in the comic and links to Monet St. Croix were made by the subsequent creative team.\n\nThe powers of the different hosts/prisoners of the Penance form vary, but the hollow Penance form's powers are red diamond-hard skin and extended super-long razor-sharp claws on their fingers, toes, and hair follicles. Because of the density of the skin, it is quite durable, as well as resistant to psychic intrusion. Hollow also possesses animalistic agility (as she usually moves around by crouching and padding and leaping on all fours) and dexterity (as she has been shown on occasion to use her feet to grab and grip objects and people, as if they were just like her hands).\n\n\n"}

Its principal subject is interior design and landscaping, rather than pure external architecture. The magazine is published by Condé Nast, which also publishes international editions of \"Architectural Digest\" in China, France, Germany, Russia, Spain, Mexico, and Latin America.\n\n\"Architectural Digest\" is aimed at an affluent and style-conscious readership, and is subtitled \"The International Design Authority\". The magazine also releases the annual AD100 list, which recognizes the most influential interior designers and architects around the world.\n\nOriginally a quarterly trade directory called \"The Architectural Digest: A Pictorial Digest of California's Best Architecture\", the magazine was launched in 1920 by John Coke Brasfield (1880–1962). Brasfield, born in Tennessee, moved to southern California in the early 1900s, where he founded the John C. Brasfield Publishing Corporation in Los Angeles. Interiors and exteriors of residences were featured in the magazine, along with floor plans.\n\nBy 1963, the magazine's subtitle had been altered to \"A Pictorial Digest of Outstanding Architecture, Interior Design, and Landscaping\", and it began publishing on a bimonthly schedule.

As a player, he had spells with Liverpool, Derby County, Southampton and Oxford United during the 1980s and 1990s. He made 45 appearances for the English national football team, and was a member of the team which reached the semi-finals of the FIFA World Cup in 1990. At club level, the central defender won the 1992 FA Cup final as captain of Liverpool.\n\nSince retiring as a player in 1998, Wright has worked as a football manager, pundit, and businessman. He has had three stints as manager of Chester City, during the first of which he led the club back into the Football League as Football Conference champions after a four-year exile. He has also had spells managing Peterborough United, Oxford United and Southport.\n\nHe is a regular pundit on LFC TV, Liverpool's official TV channel, and uses his experience as a foster carer and ambassador to advocate for more people to help children in need.\n\nAlong with Michael Owen, another ex-Liverpool and England player, Wright is a founder of Red Sports, a Liverpool-based company that specialises in soccer school and coaching education programmes in China.\n\nWright also founded Premier Legends, a company that gives fans around the world the chance to join ex-England and Premier League players for stadium tours, exhibition games, golf outings, dinners and audience Q+A sessions.\n\nWright was born in Dorchester on Thames, Oxfordshire. He said he got into professional football late because he had stayed in school an extra year in order to get qualifications to become a PE teacher.\n\nWright began his career with Oxford United, eventually signing his first professional contract in August 1980. He was handed his first team debut at the age of 16 by manager Ian Greaves when the club were playing in the Third Division. The tall central defender made only 10 appearances for the club, all of which came in his second season as a professional, when he helped Oxford finish fifth in the league.\n\nWright did not finish the 1982–1983 campaign with Oxford, however, as on 25 March 1982 (deadline day) he was transferred to Southampton, who were then playing in the top flight of English football. Wright moved to Southampton for a transfer fee of £80,000 along with Oxford United forward Keith Cassells in a deal that saw Trevor Hebberd move the other way.\n\nWright was only 18 when he arrived at the Dell and the Saints were flying high at the top of the table under manager Lawrie McMenemy. He made his debut for the club in a 3–1 win over Leeds United at Elland Road on 17 April 1982, a game which saw two Saints legends, Kevin Keegan and David Armstrong, score the goals. He featured in two of the Saints' remaining five league matches that season as Southampton eventually finished seventh in the league and qualified for the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn the 1982–83 season, Wright's first full campaign with the club, the Saints finished 12th in the old First Division. Wright scored his first league goal for the club in a 2–2 draw with Luton Town at The Dell on 30 April 1983. After finishing with two goals in 39 appearances, he was voted Player of the Year by the club's supporters.\n\nWright's star continued to rise during the 1983–84 season as he helped Saints to second place in the league – their highest ever finish. They finished only three points behind Liverpool, who also won the European Cup that season. A Southampton team that included England goalkeeper Peter Shilton also reached the FA Cup semi-finals that season, losing in extra-time to eventual winners Everton. Wright's performances at the heart of Saints' defence that year resulted in him making his debut for England in May 1984.\n\nThe following season Southampton performed strongly again, finishing fifth in the league, and after Chris Nicholl replaced McMenemy as manager in July 1985, Wright helped the club reach the 1986 FA Cup semi-final. Southampton took on Liverpool at White Hart Lane in what would prove a particularly disappointing day for Wright. Ten minutes before half-time Shilton rushed from his line to help the defender cut off a Liverpool attack but the goalkeeper then collided with his own player. Wright was stretchered off due to injury and Southampton again lost after extra-time against the eventual champions. Soon afterwards it was confirmed that Wright had broken his leg, ruining his chances of making England's 1986 World Cup squad. Wright bounced back from that setback to feature 30 times in the 1986–87 season and Southampton finished 12th in the table.\n\nIn July 1987, Wright's international colleague Shilton joined Derby County, who were returning to the top flight after a seven-year absence. Soon afterwards Derby also made a bid to bring Wright to the Baseball Ground. Saints accepted the offer and Wright completed his move in August for a then-club record fee of £760,000.\n\nArthur Cox was the Derby County manager when Wright arrived at the East Midlands club, who had been promoted as champions of the Second Division at the end of the 1986–1987 season. Publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, the former chairman of Oxford United, had helped save Derby from going out of business in 1984. Installed as the club's chairman in 1987, Maxwell spent heavily to bolster the Rams' squad for their return to the First Division.\n\nWright joined Derby four games into the new season and made his debut on 29 August 1987, a 1–0 home defeat in the league against Wimbledon. Wright was soon made club captain but, despite the new signings, the Rams found life at the top table of English football tough. A strong defensive record, however, helped them finish 15th, one point above the relegation zone.\n\nMaxwell continued to invest significantly and Welsh international striker Dean Saunders joined from Oxford for £1 million in October 1988. \nWith Saunders hitting the ground running, Derby enjoyed a strong season, which included wins at Manchester United and eventual league winners Arsenal. The Rams ended the campaign fifth in the table and would have qualified for the UEFA Cup were it not for the ongoing ban on English clubs taking part in European competitions in the wake of the Heysel Stadium disaster in May 1985. Wright's contribution as part of one of the best defences in the league led to Derby fans selecting him as the 1988–89 player of the season.\n\nDerby's debts were spiraling under Maxwell's watch, however, and the following season they only managed to finish 16th. Despite their lowly position, the Rams once again had one of the best defensive records in the First Division. Six goals from Wright also helped the club avoid relegation and he was once again voted Derby's player of the season. In so doing, he became the first player to win the Jack Stamps Trophy two years in a row. Wright then had a memorable experience at the 1990 World Cup and in 2009 he revealed that he had received offers to join Roma and Fiorentina as a result.\nInstead he returned to Derby to find that the club's off-field problems were mounting. Maxwell introduced a freeze on transfers for the 1990–1991 campaign and a week into the season he put the club up for sale. Inevitably the Rams' form suffered and they endured a record 20 game winless run on their way to being relegated. \nWright left Derby for Liverpool that summer but he is still fondly remembered by Rams supporters. In 2009, as part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations, he was voted as the fourth best centre back in Derby's history. He had played 144 times for Derby scoring 10 goals.\n\nWith Derby in desperate need of raising cash and Wright aware that playing outside the top flight would diminish his chances of continuing his England career, a transfer in the summer of 1991 was always likely. Liverpool had tried to sign Wright a few months previously and their need for a quality central defender had grown following the injury problems and subsequent retirement of captain Alan Hansen. New Reds boss Graeme Souness returned with a fresh bid for Wright and the 27-year-old completed his move on 15 July 1991. The transfer fee was £2.2 million – a record sum for a defender in English football.\n\nWright made his debut on 17 August in a 2–1 league win over Oldham Athletic at Anfield but he suffered an injury that kept him out for three months soon afterwards. Having narrowly missed out on the league title the year before Wright's arrival, a much-changed Liverpool squad finished a disappointing sixth in the table in his first season. They were knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Genoa at the quarter-final stage but the season ended on a positive note with victory in the FA Cup. Wright captained the side as they beat Second Division Sunderland 2–0 in the decider.\n\nWright was captain again for the 1992–93 campaign and he headed home his first goal for the Reds in a 1–1 draw with his former club Southampton in September 1992. Spartak Moscow beat the Reds in the European Cup Winners Cup second round despite Wright getting on the scoresheet in the first leg. \nThe title holders were knocked out in the third round of the FA Cup by Bolton Wanderers and another sixth-placed finish in the league meant there would be no European football for Liverpool the following season.\n\nWright lost the captaincy for the 1993–94 campaign but a poor season for the club followed as Liverpool finished eighth in the league after Roy Evans replaced Souness as manager midway through the year. \nThe arrival of Phil Babb and John Scales, as well as a series of injuries, restricted Wright to just six appearances in the 1994–95 campaign, which saw Liverpool finish fourth and beat Bolton to win the League Cup.\n\nHaving missed almost a year of football, and aged 32 when the 1995–1996 campaign kicked off, Wright proved many doubters wrong by regaining a starting place at club level. Liverpool finished 3rd in the league and were runners-up to Manchester United in the FA Cup final. Wright's return to form earned him a recall to the England national team. Another injury meant Wright missed out on Euro 96 but the following season he helped Liverpool to a fourth-placed finish in the league. Wright also scored the second goal in Liverpool's 2–0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. But the Reds had lost the first leg 3–0 so his header was not enough for them to qualify for the final.\n\nAfter two excellent seasons, however, Wright was forced to retire from playing in September 1998, at the age of 35, due to a back problem. In seven years at the club, he scored nine goals in 210 appearances. A 2006 LFC TV programme entitled 100 Players Who Shook the Kop, based on a survey of the club's fans, ranked Wright at number 65 in order of the impact he made on Liverpool's history. An updated version of the programme, broadcast in August 2013, had Wright at number 87.\n\nWright made four appearances for England's under-21 side in 1983 before Bobby Robson handed him his first chance at senior international level. Wright was still playing at Southampton when he made his debut against Wales in a Home International Championship fixture on 2 May 1984. \nThe 20 year old started at centre half alongside Alvin Martin but Wales striker Mark Hughes, another debutant, got the only goal at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. \nWright made 12 more appearances for England ahead of the 1986 World Cup but his leg break in that year's FA Cup semi-final put paid to his hopes of going to Mexico for the tournament.\n\nWright returned for England's bid to qualify for the 1988 European Championship and played in their first two games against the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands at the final tournament in West Germany. The finals did not go well, however, as Robson's side lost both those games as well as their final group match against the USSR. \nFollowing Euro 88, the emergence of Des Walker meant that Wright went almost two years before earning another cap for England.\n\nWright did not feature during the 1990 World Cup qualifying campaign but he was still included in the squad for the finals in Italy, ahead of Tony Adams, as back-up to Walker and Terry Butcher. Following a 1–1 draw against the Republic of Ireland in England's opening group game, Robson decided to change his system and Wright was included as a sweeper in a three-man defence for the 0–0 draw with the Netherlands. \nWright then headed home on 58 minutes in a 1–0 win over Egypt in Cagliari in England's final group match. It was Wright's only goal for his country but it proved a vital one as it ensured England would qualify for the last 16 as Group F winners. Wright helped England keep another clean sheet against Belgium in the knockout stages and a late David Platt goal in extra-time set up a meeting with Cameroon in the last eight. Wright was forced off with a head injury as England trailed 2–1 but after being patched up he ended the game in a defensive midfield role and Gary Lineker's two penalties helped England qualify after extra-time. Wright also played the full 120 minutes in the semi-final against West Germany but England lost on penalties after 1–1 draw. Wright then got through 72 minutes as England lost the third-place play-off 2–1 against the host country Italy in Bari.\n\nWright continued to be a regular starter for England during the qualifying campaign for the next European Championship and even captained the side in a friendly win over the USSR at Wembley in May 1991. \nInjury problems restricted his progress in the 1991–92 season but he still looked set to take part in the tournament in Sweden. For the second time in his career, however, he was cruelly denied the chance to play at a finals. After aggravating an Achilles injury in a friendly against Finland, Wright was forced to withdraw from England's squad days before Euro 92 got underway. \nEngland finished bottom of their group but despite returning to fitness Wright only played once more under Taylor, a friendly against Spain in September 1992. He was dropped in October of that year but without him England failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. \nWright's injury problems were becoming more frequent, however, and he was overlooked by new England manager boss Terry Venables while trying to rebuild his career at club level with Liverpool.\n\nIn the 1995–96 season Liverpool's improved form coincided with Wright's return to the first team and he earned a surprise recall to the England set-up in April 1996. England were due to host Euro 96 that summer and Wright made his first appearance for his country in almost four years in a friendly against Croatia. Wright again featured in a three-man defence a month later as England won 3–0 against Hungary at Wembley but yet again injury struck at the wrong time. Wright strained knee ligaments only 12 minutes into the game, which meant that he would ultimately miss out on another major tournament. That match against Hungary in May 1996 proved to be Wright's last for England. In total he had won 45 caps over a 12-year period. The England manager for the vast majority of those games was Robson, a man Wright later described as \"the most important person in my football career.\"\n\nWright was seen as a tough central defender who was good on the ball and an excellent reader of the game. Former Derby and England centre back Roy McFarland, who was Derby's assistant manager when Wright was at the club, said that he \"had it all – power, pace, control\". Ex-Derby midfielder Craig Ramage praised his former teammate as \"a real leader\" who was \"dominant in the air, composed with the ball at his feet and great in the tackle.\" Ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said Wright was \"very cool under pressure\" and was like \"hard rock\" in defence. His \"smooth\" playing style has also been compared to Alan Hansen, the former Liverpool captain he was brought in to help replace at Anfield.\n\nWright took on his first managerial role at Southport F.C. in December 1999. At the time the club were in the relegation positions in the Football Conference but Wright successfully steered his side to ninth in the table by the season's end. \nIn his first full campaign, Wright did even better as the club finished fourth in the standings.\n\nWright left Southport in the summer of 2001 to take over at Oxford United, where he had started his playing career. The club had just been relegated to the Third Division but Wright resigned at the end of November 2001 hours before he was fined by the Football Association and given a four match touchline ban for verbally abusing a referee. Wright said he was not told that the charges included a \"racial element\" and denied making such comments. The FA said the first of two offensive remarks reported had not been heard by the match referee and its disciplinary commission said they were \"not satisfied that the first remark had taken place.\"\n\nWright soon found another job in the Conference and was named manager of Chester City in January 2002. \nThe club were second bottom of the table when Wright took over but he guided them to safety. \nIn the 2002–3 season, Chester came close to promotion but they lost their Conference play-off semi-final to Doncaster Rovers in a penalty shootout. After that defeat Wright vowed his side would \"come back stronger\" and the following season they won the Conference title - sealing promotion with a 1–0 win over Scarborough in April 2004. Wright said he would \"cherish\" the moment Chester confirmed their return to the Football League but he would not be in charge for their first game in League Two the following season.\n\nWright left the club on 6 August 2004, a day before the new league campaign got underway, describing it as the \"saddest day of my life\". He denied that there had been a dispute with players or staff but said he felt his position was untenable as he \"could not take the club forward.\"\n\nWright returned to management when he was hired by League Two side Peterborough in May 2005. \nWright's reign got off to a promising start and his team were seventh in the table in January 2006. But that month he was suspended by the club pending an internal investigation and a week later he was sacked after failing to attend a disciplinary hearing.\n\nIt later emerged that Wright had not attended the inquiry on the advice of his solicitor and that he intended to sue the club for breach of contract and damage to his reputation. Wright said he was \"deeply hurt\" and he categorically rejected allegations about his conduct.\n\nIn February 2006, less than a month after leaving Peterborough, Wright was offered the chance to return to Chester as manager until the end of the season. \nHe helped the club avoid relegation from League Two and was rewarded with a new two-year contract in May. \nThe following season did not go as well, however, and Wright left his role in April 2007.\n\nWith Chester still struggling, Wright was brought back for a third spell as manager in November 2008. The club was put up for sale 10 days after Wright's return though, and they were also operating under a transfer embargo. \nThis time Wright, who was working on a non-contract basis, was unable to stave off relegation to the Conference. \nChester then entered administration and in June 2009 Wright resigned as manager.\n\nIn May 2017, he returned to Southport as Head of Club Development, although he and the entire management team left only four months later after the team lost five straight matches and conceded 19 goals.\n\nWright and his wife Sue became foster careers for a three-year-old girl in 2008 and he has since used his experience and profile to advocate for more people to help children in need. \nHe is an ambassador for Foster Care Associates and both at home and abroad he has tried to raise awareness of the importance of foster care and adoption.\nIn November 2013, he joined Foster Care Associates in a national campaign to find an additional 10,000 foster carers – the Mark Wright UK10K campaign.\n\nIn June 2015, as part of Foster Care Fortnight, Wright helped organise a football legends match on top of a hotel roof to raise awareness of the 10,000 children in the UK who are still waiting for foster parents. Ex-Liverpool and Everton players John Barnes, Neville Southall and Peter Reid also took part in the event. Wright said that ex-Everton and Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall became a foster carer after speaking with him about the situation.\n\nIn 2016, Wright and his former Liverpool teammate and England striker Michael Owen set up Red Sports, a company that is developing coaching programmes in China. Red Sports hopes to educate a minimum of 1,200 local coaches per year and says its overall aim is to engage children in China by \"radically changing the way football is taught at school level.\"\n\nThe Liverpool-based organisation says it is focusing on \"mass participation rather than elite development\" in the belief that China \"has the potential to be a 21st Century superpower of football.\"\nWright said \"a stable of high-profile former footballers\" would assist with the specially-designed training programmes for soccer schools. Owen said they would help children in China learn about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. \nWright had earlier struck a deal with Chinese businessman Dr Tony Tung in March 2016 with a view to launching a pilot soccer schools programme in China.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Wright also founded Premier Legends, a company that gives fans the chance to join ex-England and Premier League players for stadium tours, exhibition and charity games, golf outings, dinners and audience Q+A sessions. Currently it operates in the UK, Gibraltar, Spain and China. \nWright said he also hoped to use the project \"to raise awareness for adoption and fostering\" both in the UK and around the world.\n\nHe also regularly contributes to LFC TV as a pundit and appears on the after-dinner sports speaker circuit.\n\n"}

It has a trailing semiwoody vine covered with small recurved prickles that can be painful to bare skin.\n\nThe ribbed stems of this plant usually grow to or more and are branched. Plants rarely reach more than in height. The frond-like leaves are alternate with prickly stalks. The bipinnate leaf blades are divided into four to nine pairs of small segments, and these are again divided into 8-15 pairs of tiny leaflets. Leaflets are elliptic, glabrous, with a prominent midrib. Like a few other species of \"Mimosa\" (such as \"M. pudica\"), the leaves fold up when touched or disturbed. It is also said that the roots of \"M. nuttallii\" give off an acrid, garlic like smell when disturbed. This may be an additional defense mechanism of the plant.\n\nThe tiny flowers occur in congested bunches. Before they open, they look much like small green bramble fruits. Each individual flower has five minute petals and eight to ten conspicuous stamens. When open, the pink-purple stamens form a globelike cluster at the tip of their leafless stalk. Yellow spores can be often be seen highlighting the tips. The globes are about across. Flowers and fruits appear from May to September.\n\nThe fruit of the catclaw brier is a long, slender, rounded pod that has a covering of dense prickles, typically about long.\n\nHabitat includes disturbed areas of sandy or silty soils, roadsides, grasslands, prairies and forest margins. It is known to be very nutritious for livestock, who will seek it out. On rangeland, its absence can also be a good indicator of overgrazing.\n\nOther common names for this plant include Nuttall's sensitive briar and shame-boy, a reference to the sensitive foliage that closes upon touch. Former synonyms include \"Schrankia nuttallii\". The species name \"nuttallii\" is in honor of Thomas Nuttall, an English botanist who lived in the United States for many years.\n\n"}
{"id": "1967620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967620", "title": "Irene (musical)", "text": "Irene (musical)\n\nIrene is a musical with a book by James Montgomery, lyrics by Joseph McCarthy, and music by Harry Tierney. Based on Montgomery's play \"Irene O'Dare\", it is set in New York City's Upper West Side and focuses on immigrant shop assistant Irene O'Dare, who is introduced to Long Island's high society when she is hired by one of its leading grande dames to help redecorate her home.\n\nThe musical opened on Broadway in 1919 and ran for 675 performances, at the time the record for the longest-running musical in Broadway history, which it maintained for nearly two decades. It starred Edith Day in the title role, who repeated the role in the London production. It was revived on Broadway in 1923, filmed twice, and had a major Broadway revival in 1973, starring Debbie Reynolds, followed by a 1976 London run that lasted 974 performances.\n\nThe original Broadway production, directed by Edward Royce, opened on November 18, 1919 at the Vanderbilt Theatre, where it ran for 675 performances, at the time the record for the longest-running show in Broadway history, one it maintained for nearly two decades. The cast included Edith Day as Irene, Walter Regan as tycoon Donald Marshall, Eva Puck as Helen Cheston, Gladys Miller as Jane Gilmour, and Bobby Watson as 'Madame Lucy', a flamboyant male dress designer. The show made a star of Day, who departed the cast after five months to recreate her role at London's Empire Theatre, where it ran for 399 performances. Day was replaced in the Broadway production by Helen Shipman. \n\n\"Irene\" enjoyed a brief Broadway revival at Jolson's 59th Street Theatre in 1923 with Dale Winter as Irene, Jere Delaney as Madame Lucy, and Walter Regan reprising his role as Donald. Eventually there were 17 national touring companies, and it was filmed twice, first as a 1926 silent movie with Colleen Moore and again in 1940 with Anna Neagle.\n\nIn 1971, the revival of the 1925 musical \"No, No, Nanette\" with film star Ruby Keeler proved to be a hit. Its producer, Harry Rigby, deciding to cash in on the nostalgia craze by reviving another vintage show with another glamorous movie star as its centerpiece, zeroed in on \"Irene\", engaging Debbie Reynolds to make her Broadway debut in the title role. Rigby hired librettist Hugh Wheeler to rework the show, which retained only five of the original songs and added tunes written by McCarthy with other composers and original numbers by Charles Gaynor and Otis Clements, with additional material written by Wally Harper and Jack Lloyd for the revival. Actor John Gielgud was hired to direct.\n\nThe production was troubled from the beginning. Billy De Wolfe withdrew due to illness and was replaced by George S. Irving as Madame Lucy. Reviews in Toronto were mixed, and when Reynolds was stricken with a throat ailment, the producers, rather than cancel the sell-out performances, had her mime her dialogue and songs on stage to Gielgud's reading of them from the wings, much to the dismay of angry audiences. Philadelphia critics were brutal, and Gielgud, an odd choice for a lightweight musical comedy, was replaced by Gower Champion, who had helmed a Los Angeles revival of \"Annie Get Your Gun\" with Reynolds. Peter Gennaro was hired to restage the musical numbers, and Joseph Stein was brought in to doctor the book, which now had Irene posing as a countess in cahoots with couturier Madame Lucy (the former Liam O'Dougherty) in a scheme to promote his fashions. Postponing the Broadway opening, the producers brought the work-in-progress to Washington, D.C., where it was seen by President Nixon and his family. Their declaration that \"Irene\" was a hit made headlines and spurred advance-ticket sales in New York City.\n\nAfter 13 previews, the revival opened on March 13, 1973 as the inaugural production of the Minskoff Theatre, where it set new box-office records. It ran for 594 performances. In addition to Reynolds and Irving (who won the Tony Award for his performance), the cast included Patsy Kelly, Monte Markham as Donald, Ruth Warrick, Janie Sell, Meg Bussert, and Reynolds' daughter Carrie Fisher. Raoul Pène Du Bois designed the sets and costumes, with the exception of Reynolds' costumes, which were by Irene Sharaff. The Broadway reviews were mixed, but Clive Barnes of \"The New York Times\" described it as \"raucous, frequently cheerful, and the best 1919 musical in town.\" Reynolds and Kelly were each nominated for a Tony Award; Reynolds for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical and Kelly for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical. Reynolds' former MGM co-star, Jane Powell, replaced her in February 1974. \"New York Times\" reviewer Mel Gussow wrote that \"even though Miss Reynolds is gone, \"Irene\" survives. The two stars are an equal match for peppiness. Miss Reynolds may score a point for clowning, but Miss Powell wins two for softness.\" \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\", which had been cut during the pre-Broadway try-outs (although Reynolds' rendition was included in the cast album), was restored to the score. Reynolds returned to play the final week before the revival closed on September 8, 1974, and then took the show on a national tour, playing for five months and setting new box-office records before being replaced again by Powell.\n\nThe success of this revival led to a 1973 Australian production with Julie Anthony, who then went on to star in a 1976 London revival at the Adelphi Theatre, directed by Freddie Carpenter and choreographed by Norman Maen, that lasted 974 performances. The cast also included Jon Pertwee and Eric Flynn. Additional changes were made in the song list.\n\nIrene O'Dare is a humble but ambitious, hard-working Irish girl from the West side of Manhattan, who runs a little music store with her widowed mother. Irene is sent to tune a piano for young tycoon Donald Marshall III, a Long Island society gentleman. Once at Donald's estate, Irene falls in love with him, and each is captivated by how different the other is from their usual friends. \n\nDonald's ne'er-do-well cousin Ozzie wants help to jump-start a fashion business to be run by his friend, \"Madame Lucy\", a flamboyant male artiste, who pretends to be a famous French couturier. Irene and her pretty best friends, Helen McFudd and Jane Burke, are recruited to model Madame Lucy's gowns, and Donald provides financing. Irene agrees to pose as a society girl to convince everyone to shop at Madame Lucy's, but she becomes angry with Donald when he asks her to continue the ruse. Meanwhile, Irene's mother and Donald's mother do not see eye-to-eye. \n\nMadame Lucy, Helen, Jane and Ozzie are overjoyed at their success as Madame Lucy's creations are now world-famous. Donald realizes that he loves Irene. He goes to the piano store but on the way he runs into some unsavory fellows who beat him badly. He and Irene reconcile but then argue again, and he runs out. Helen and Jane give Donald some advice about acting like a man and wooing Irene properly. Following their counsel, he sweeps her into his arms and kisses her passionately, which results in more bruises, this time from her. \n\nAt the grand ball at Donald's estate, Irene finds her mother brokenhearted over Liam O'Dougherty, the love of her life. It turns out that Madame Lucy is Liam O'Dougherty, and he reunites happily with Irene's mother. Donald announces that he loves Irene, and her true identity is revealed. He tells her: \"You made me love you\", and all ends happily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Irene\" was adapted for a 1926 silent film starring Colleen Moore, a June 1936 Lux Radio Theatre production with Jeanette MacDonald and Regis Toomey, and a 1940 film remake starring Anna Neagle and Ray Milland.\n\n"}

Listed at , 139 lb., she batted and threw right-handed.\n\nRuth Williams debuted in the AAGPBL as a 20-year rookie and had a solid if unspectacular career that spanned eight seasons. Used as a spot starter and reliever, Williams collected at least ten wins in five of those seasons, while her 2.19 career earned run average ranks her twelfth in the all-time list of AAGPBL pitchers with at least 1,000 innings of work. During her career she hurled eight eight two-hitters, one of them a no-hitter going into the ninth inning of a contest.\n\nBorn in Nescopeck, Pennsylvania, Williams began playing softball at age 12 in a church league. When she was a sophomore at East Stroudsburg University, Williams played for the New York Traders, a fastpitch softball team that paid her travel and food expenses for her to play during the weekends. After her father read about the AAGPBL in a \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" advertisement, he motivated his daughter to attend a tryout in Allentown. About 400 girls attended, and three days later she received an offer to join the league.\n\nWilliams opened 1946 with the Racine Belles, but ten days later was transferred to the Fort Wayne Daisies. She was relegated to a bench role for most of the year, pitching in just one game while striking out a batter in one inning. She was traded to the South Bend Blue Sox a year later. Meanwhile, she finished her Physical Education and General Science degrees from ESU and began teaching at Wissahickon High School in Ambler, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1947, Blue Sox manager Chet Grant gave Williams a chance to join the pitching rotation, which included the experimented Jean Faut, Phyllis Koehn and Ruby Stephens. Williams responded with a 12–8 record and 1.70 ERA in 25 games, striking out 48 in 180 innings. Her performance slacked to a 10–10 mark and a 2.25 ERA in 1948, but she still managed to strike out 55 and collect 160 innings in 23 games.\n\nHer most productive season in 1949, when she posted a 10–6 record with a career-high 1.64 ERA, which ranked her as the ninth best in ERA and winning percentage (.625), helping her team tie for first place with the Rockford Peaches. Since she was still teaching in Pennsylvania, the Blue Sox flew Williams in for the Memorial Day weekend in order to pitch. She then won two games and returned to school to finish out the school year.\n\nWilliams started 1950 with South Bend, but was traded to the Peoria Redwings during the midseason and ended the year with the Kalamazoo Lassies. She combined for a 5–10 record with a 3.47 ERA in just 19 games. She did not have much run support from the Lassies and recorded losing records for the remaining three years of career by going 10–11, 10–12 and 8–12. Nevertheless, she posted low earned runs averages of 1.96, 2.48 and 2.12, pitched a career-high 174 innings in 1952, and finished ninth in ERA in 1951.\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Williams married Leonard Heverly and continued her work in Ambler. The couple adopted two sons, Richard and Mike, but tragedy struck in 1980 when her husband died in an unfortunate traffic collision caused by a drunk driver. She retired after the accident.\n\nWilliams later attended the AAGPBL Players Association reunions. The association was largely responsible for the opening of \"Women in Baseball\", a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.\n\nIn 1995 Ruth Williams Heverly suffered a heart attack, which slowed her life down considerably for the next ten years. She died at her home in Ambler, Pennsylvania, just two days short of her 79th birthday.\n\nRegular season\n\nPostseason\n"}

He was elected chairman of the CDU/CSU group in the same year as Angela Merkel was elected chairwoman of the CDU, and at the time they were rivals for the leadership of the party. In 2002, he stepped down as leader of the opposition in favour of Merkel and gradually withdrew from politics, focusing on his legal career and leaving parliament entirely in 2009. In 2004 he became a senior counsel with Mayer Brown, where he has focused on mergers and acquisitions, banking and finance, and compliance. He has served on the boards of numerous companies. In 2018 he announced his return to politics.\n\nMerz has described himself as socially conservative and economically liberal, and is seen as a representative of the conservative and pro-business wings of the CDU. He has been chairman of the Atlantik-Brücke association which promotes German-American understanding and Atlanticism, and is a staunch supporter of the European Union and NATO, having described himself as \"a truly convinced European, a convinced transatlanticist.\" Merz advocates a closer union and \"an army for Europe.\"\n\nMerz is Roman Catholic and of French Huguenot descent on his mother's side. He is married to the judge Charlotte Merz, and they have three children. Merz' work as a corporate lawyer has made him a multimillionaire. He is also a licensed private pilot and owns two airplanes.\n\nFriedrich Merz was born in Brilon in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in then-West Germany to Roman Catholic parents Joachim Merz and Paula née Sauvigny. His father was a judge and a CDU member until he left the party in 2007. The Sauvigny family was a prominent patrician family in Brilon, of French Huguenot ancestry; his grandfather Josef Paul Sauvigny was a lawyer and served as mayor of Brilon from 1917 to 1937.\n\nAfter finishing his Abitur exam in 1975 Merz served his military service as a soldier with a self-propelled artillery unit of the German Army. From 1976 he studied law with a scholarship from the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, first at the University of Bonn, later at the University of Marburg. He became a member of , a Catholic student fraternity founded in 1844 that is part of the Cartellverband. After finishing law school in 1985 he became a judge in Saarbrücken. In 1986 he quit his position as a judge in order to work as an in-house attorney-at-law at the German Chemical Industry Association in Bonn and Frankfurt from 1986 to 1989.\n\nMerz speaks German, French and English.\n\nIn 1972, at the age of seventeen, he became a member of the CDU's youth wing, the Young Union, and he has been described by German media as a member of the \"Andean Pact,\" a supposed network of influential CDU members formed by members of the Young Union during a trip to the South American Andes region in 1979. He became President of the Brilon branch of the Young Union in 1980.\n\nMerz successfully ran as a candidate in the 1989 European Parliament election and served one term as a Member of the European Parliament until 1994. He was a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and of the parliament's delegation for relations with Malta.\n\nFrom the 1994 German elections, he served as member of the Bundestag for his constituency, the Hochsauerland. In his first term, he was a member of the Finance Committee.\n\nIn October 1998 Merz became vice-chairman and in February 2000 Chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group (alongside Michael Glos), succeeding Wolfgang Schäuble. In this capacity, he was the opposition leader in the Bundestag during Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's first term.\n\nAhead of the 2002 elections, Edmund Stoiber included Merz in his shadow cabinet for the Christian Democrats’ campaign to unseat incumbent Schröder as chancellor. During the campaign, Merz served as Stoiber's expert for financial markets and the national budget. After Stoiber's electoral defeat, Angela Merkel assumed the leadership of the parliamentary group; Merz again served as vice-chairman until 2004. From 2002 to 2004, he was also a member of the executive board of the CDU, again under the leadership of Merkel.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, Merz was a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs. By 2007, he announced he would not be running for political office in the 2009 elections.\n\nUpon leaving politics, Merz has worked as a corporate lawyer. Since 2004 he has been a Senior Counsel at Mayer Brown's Düsseldorf office, where he works on the corporate finance team; before 2004 he was a senior counsel with Cornelius Bartenbach Haesemann. His work as a lawyer has made him a multimillionaire. He has also taken on numerous positions on corporate boards, including the following:\n\n\nBetween 2010 and 2011, Merz represented the shareholders of WestLB, a publicly owned institution that had previously been Germany's third-largest lender, in talks with bidders. In 2012, he joined Norbert Röttgen’s campaign team for the North Rhine-Westphalia state election as advisor on economic policy. He served as a CDU delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2012 and in 2017.\n\nIn November 2017, Merz was appointed by Minister-President Armin Laschet of North Rhine-Westphalia as his Commissioner for Brexit and Transatlantic Relations, an unpaid advisory position.\n\nAfter Angela Merkel announced her intention to step down as Leader of the CDU party, Merz announced he would run in the subsequent party leadership election in December 2018. His candidacy was promoted by the former CDU chairman and \"crown prince\" of the Kohl era, Wolfgang Schäuble (current President of the Bundestag, ranked second in federal precedence). In the second round of the leadership election, Merz was defeated by Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. On February 25, 2020, he announced his candidacy in the 2020 CDU leadership election.\n\nMerz has focused on economic policy, foreign and security policy and family policy. He has described himself as socially conservative and economically liberal, and is seen as a representative of the conservative and pro-business wings of the CDU. He has been chairman of the Atlantik-Brücke association which promotes German-American understanding and Atlanticism, and is a staunch supporter of the European Union and NATO. As a young politician in the 1970s and 1980s, he was a staunch supporter of anticommunism, the dominant state doctrine of West Germany and a core tenet of the CDU. In 2018, he described himself as \"a truly convinced European, a convinced transatlanticist\" and said that \"I stand for a cosmopolitan Germany whose roots lie in Christian ethics and the European Enlightenment and whose most important political allies are the democracies of the West. I gladly use this expression again: The democracies of the West.\" He especially advocates closer relations between Germany and France. Merz has criticized Donald Trump more harshly than Angela Merkel did and has especially criticized Trump's trade war against Europe. In 2018, he co-authored an article in defence of the European project, which among other things called for \"an army for Europe.\"\n\n\nFriedrich Merz is married to the judge Charlotte Merz. He has three children and resides in Arnsberg in the Sauerland region. In 2005, the couple established the Friedrich und Charlotte Merz Stiftung, a foundation supporting projects in the education sector. \n\nOn 17 March 2020 Merz was tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n"}

It was first released on his 1969 album with Crazy Horse, \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\". Young explained the context of the story in the liner notes of his 1977 anthology album \"Decade\", stating that he wrote \"Down by the River,\" \"Cinnamon Girl\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" while delirious in bed in Topanga Canyon with a fever.\n\nThe lyrics tell the story of someone who killed his lover by shooting her after feeling unable to continue from the emotional highs of their relationship. Young himself has provided multiple explanations for the lyrics. In an interview with Robert Greenfield in 1970, a year after the song was released, Young claimed that \"there's no real murder in it. It's about blowing your thing with a chick. It's a plea, a desperate cry.\" Later, when introducing the song in New Orleans on September 27, 1984, Young said that the song depicts a man \"who had a lot of trouble controlling himself\" who catches his woman cheating on him, then meets her down by the river and shoots her. According to Young, the local sheriff comes to the man's house and arrests him a few hours later.\n\n\"Down by the River\" begins with electric guitars followed by bass guitar and snare drum before the vocals begin. The vocal sections are taken at a slow tempo. There are long instrumental passages after each of the first two refrains, during which Young plays short, staccato notes on his guitar and incorporates distortion. The song is composed in the key of E minor. The verse follows a chord progression of Em7-A while the pre-chorus is Cmajor7-Bm-Cmajor7-Bm-C-Bm-D and the chorus is G-D-D-A.\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" critic Rob Sheffield calls \"Down by the River\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" the \"key tracks\" on \"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere\", calling them \"long, violent guitar jams, rambling over the nine-minute mark with no trace of virtuosity at all, just staccato guitar blasts sounding as though Young is parachuting down into the middle of the Hatfield-McCoy feud. In one solo, the same staccato note is repeated 38 times. In 2015, Phish guitarist, Trey Anastasio wrote, \"If I was ever going to teach a master class to young guitarists, the first thing I would play them is the first minute of Neil Young's original \"Down by the River\" solo. It's one note, but it's so melodic, and it just snarls with attitude and anger. It's like he desperately wants to connect.\" Anastasio declared Young the 17th greatest guitarist, based largely on this performance. Allmusic critic Bill Janovitz describes the groove as \"lazy, almost funky,\" stating that this helps partially obscure the \"malevolence in its lyric.\" However, Janovitz goes on to note that the \"very sparseness on 'Down by the River' only acts as a haunting void for its blues, like John Lee Hooker's 'Tupelo'.\" \n\n\nLive performances vary from shorter solo acoustic performances, as on the Crosby Stills Nash & Young release \"Four Way Street\", to twelve minutes long, as on the \"Live at the Fillmore East\" release featuring Crazy Horse. At the Rock Am Ring in Germany in 2002, Young, backed by Booker T Jones, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, and Frank Sampedro, played \"Down by the River\" for over 27 minutes. At Farm Aid 1998, Young joined Phish—who headlined that year's festival—during the band's jam out of \"Runaway Jim\", leading them into a 20-minute version of \"Down by the River\". The Boston-based band SHED recorded a live 33 minute version that was included on their EP \"5 Sticks\", recorded in August 2011. Neil Young and Promise of the Real played a 20-minute version of this song at Desert Trip.\n\nA CSNY performance of the song from September 1969 was included in the 1971 documentary Celebration at Big Sur.\n\nYoung performed it with CSNY on the ABC TV show the Music Scene in 1969.\n\nJoey Gregorash covered this song in 1971 gaining a lot of airplay in Canada, and reaching #6 on the RPM Magazine charts.\n\nGuitarist Roy Buchanan recorded a cover version of \"Down by the River\" on his 1971 album \"Buch and the Snakestretchers\", and on his 1978 album \"You're Not Alone\". The Meters, The String Cheese Incident, Dave Matthews Band, Indigo Girls, Inner Circle, Low/Dirty Three, Tall Firs, McKendree Spring, Michael McDonald, The Mother Hips, The Sheepdogs, Puss n Boots, Norman Whitfield & The Undisputed Truth, Buddy Miles and Griffin also cover this song. The song appears on the Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds 2007 live release \"Live at Radio City\". Robert Plant borrows the line, \"Be on my side, I'll be on your side, there is no reason for you to hide,\" in the live versions of \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"How Many More Times\" recorded in 1970 at Royal Albert Hall (from the \"Led Zeppelin DVD\"). \n\nCanadian musician Edwin borrows elements of the song in his 1999 song, \"Trippin'\".\n\nLow and Dirty Three teamed up to cover \"Down by the River\" on In the Fishtank 7\n\nA cover by Johnny Maestro & the Brooklyn Bridge charted two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 from 7/11 to 7/18/1970, peaking at position 91.\n\nA cover by Buddy Miles charted seven weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 from 7/18 to 8/29/1970, peaking at position 68.\n\nAmerican experimental artist Jude the Obscure covered the song for their 2019 album Plastic.\n\nIndie rock musician Car Seat Headrest incorporated elements of \"Down by the River\" in his 2013 song, \"The Gun Song.\"\n\nActor Bradley Cooper performed a vivid air-guitar cover of the song on The Tonight Show in 2015.\n\n"}

Having led the responsible government movement in the territory during the latter days of Company rule, he was Southern Rhodesia's first head of government after it became a self-governing colony within the British Empire.\n\nBorn, raised and educated in South Africa, of Irish descent, Coghlan moved to Bulawayo in 1900 to practise as a lawyer. He was elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council in 1908, representing the Western electoral district. Over the next decade he supported the renewal of the British South Africa Company's royal charter to administer the Rhodesias, and opposed Southern Rhodesia's amalgamation with either Northern Rhodesia or the Union of South Africa. He led a delegation to London to discuss responsible government in 1921, and two years later Southern Rhodesia became a self-governing colony. Coghlan sat in the Legislative Assembly as Member for Bulawayo from 1924 to his death.\n\nCoghlan was buried near Cecil Rhodes's grave, at \"World's View\" in the Matopos Hills near Bulawayo.\n\nCharles Patrick John Coghlan was born on 24 June 1863 in King William's Town, British Kaffraria (part of the Cape Colony from 1866). He had three elder brothers. His father, James Coghlan, was from Ireland and was a Catholic; he had arrived in South Africa in 1851 as a private in the British Army, having enlisted to escape the Irish Potato Famine. After fighting in the Eighth Xhosa War of 1850–53 with the 2nd (The Queen's Royal) Regiment of Foot, James was stationed in the Keiskamma mountains; he settled there with his wife Isabella Mary (née Maclaren), who was originally from Dumbartonshire, Scotland. They moved to King William's Town after Coghlan's discharge from the military and the birth of their first child, a boy also called James. The elder James Coghlan would become a town councillor in King William's Town.\n\nCharles Coghlan was educated at home until January 1870, when he was enrolled at the Jesuit St Aidan's College in Grahamstown. He was awarded a bursary to the South African College, Cape Town, where he studied law with the intent of becoming a barrister, but these plans were disrupted by his father's death from dysentery. Short of money, Charles quit university in 1882 and went to work for Paley and Coghlan, the law firm where his eldest brother James was a partner, in Kimberley.\n\nWhen Coghlan arrived to join his brother in 1882, Kimberley was a town of 22,000 in search of riches, according to John Smith Moffat. That same year, Cecil Rhodes incorporated the De Beers Mining Company and in 1883 was elected to the Cape Parliament as Member for the newly enfranchised Diamond Fields. Kimberley had come into being after diamonds were found on the De Beers brothers' farm on Colesberg Kopje in 1869. Initially dubbed \"New Rush\", the site was renamed after Lord Kimberley, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, in 1873. It was respectively and from the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (or Transvaal), the latter of which had just had its independence restored following the First Boer War of 1880–81.\n\nCoghlan was admitted to practise as advocate in the courts of West Griqualand on 9 December 1886. Ten months later, after Paley's death, Coghlan and his elder brother formed the firm of Coghlan and Coghlan. Kimberley's position at the epicentre of the diamond trade led the brothers to develop expertise and a formidable reputation for their work in the mining industry.\nRhodes outmanoeuvred his main opponent Barney Barnato and brought all the mines under the control of his company, De Beers, in 1888. On 30 October of that year, through the signing of the Rudd Concession by King Lobengula of Matabeleland, he obtained exclusive mining rights across all of Lobengula's territories in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and beyond for his soon-to-be-formed British South Africa Company (BSAC). Queen Victoria granted the BSAC a royal charter to administer and develop these territories on 29 October 1889, for an initial period of 25 years. This charter included the right to take possession of, deal with, and dispose of land. On 12 September 1890 Rhodes's Pioneer Column reached what was to become Salisbury.\n\nCoghlan took an active part in public debates. He was loyal to Britain, but held that all parts of the British Empire should be internally self-governing, with each territory supporting the others. Arguing that this should extend to his ancestral home of Ireland, he expressed support for the Home Rule movement there. He disapproved of the policy of the South African Republic government under Paul Kruger of conscripting uitlanders (mostly British settlers) for military service while denying them the electoral franchise.\n\nCoghlan was elected to the Kimberley town council in 1897. The following year Colonel Frederick Schermbrucker's youngest daughter Gertrude Mary Schermbrucker, described as an attractive and sociable woman, arrived to stay at the house Coghlan shared with his sister and mother. Coghlan married Gertrude in Wynberg, a southern suburb of Cape Town, on 10 January 1899. Around this time Coghlan's friend Percy Ross Frames invited him to join him in Bulawayo, one of the main settlements in Rhodesia, as Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the adjoining areas were now collectively called. Coghlan was receptive to the idea, but was compelled to stay in Kimberley by the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899. Kimberley was besieged by Boer forces, cut off by rail and telephone, from 14 October until its relief by General John French on 15 February 1900.\n\nAfter a break in Cape Town, Coghlan and his wife left Kimberley for Bulawayo on 30 July 1900. There, they found the conditions to be very basic and the buildings, ramshackle. Nevertheless, the settlers enjoyed outdoor pursuits, dances and musical and theatrical performances. Coghlan and his wife lodged at the Grand Hotel. In 1901, not long after they arrived, the Coghlans' first child was born, but the baby lived only three days. A second child, a girl named Petal, was born in November 1902 and lived to old age.\n\nCoghlan gained admission to the Rhodesian bar and entered into partnership with Frames to create Frames and Coghlan. Frames left for Johannesburg in late 1902, citing the poor economic conditions in Southern Rhodesia following the Second Boer War, ending this firm. Coghlan and Allan Ross Welsh formed a new partnership, Coghlan and Welsh. The firm expanded into Salisbury as Coghlan, Welsh and Tancred in 1907 when Bernard Tancred, a South African cricketer and friend of Coghlan's from Johannesburg, joined. Shortly before the 1908 elections to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council, Welsh sent a telegram to Coghlan, who was visiting relatives in Pietersburg, advising him to stand. Coghlan did so successfully in March 1908.\n\nIt was widely expected that Southern Rhodesia would eventually be incorporated into the Union of South Africa as its fifth province. It was generally considered part of South Africa geographically and in colonial terms, part of the British expansion into the region that had begun with the 1820 Settlers. Representatives from Rhodesia had participated in the South African National Convention of 1908 and section 150 of the South Africa Act 1909 made specific provision for the accession of BSAC territories. Coghlan had represented the interests of the Rhodesian people at the Convention, although his contribution was insignificant. The presence of the Rhodesian delegation had been supported - and even secured - by Louis Botha, who was keen to win the trust of the settlers. In November 1909, at a banquet for Lord Selborne, the departing High Commissioner in Cape Town, Coghlan spoke of the BSAC and the people of Southern Rhodesia working together towards entering the Union, though some settlers wished to enjoy what he called \"an artificial stage of responsible government\" first. Indeed, the order in council of 1898 had provided Southern Rhodesia with a constitution that resembled that of a Crown Colony with responsible government and the South Africa Act made no changes to the territory's administrative framework.\n\nBotha, who had been asked by the Union's first Governor-General Viscount Gladstone to form a government, began to make policies and speeches that appeared to Coghlan to be unfair to South Africans of British origin. The Attorney-General J. B. M. Hertzog interpreted the convention in a way that Coghlan considered to be to the detriment of English-speakers. Coghlan came to the conclusion in 1910 that Southern Rhodesia's joining the Union was much further off than he had previously thought, though he still saw it as the territory's inevitable destiny, whose timing and terms the local electorate must determine. At this time, he rejected the notion of responsible government—self-government while retaining colonial status—on the grounds that he thought it would take up to two decades to achieve. He was furthermore against the idea of keeping Rhodesia for English-speaking settlers, seeing in that end the same racial discrimination he perceived the Dutch-speakers to be displaying against the British in the Union.\n\nIn 1911, the partnership of Coghlan, Welsh and Tancred ended when Tancred died. Around the same time, Coghlan, who was representing a mining company, encountered Ernest Guest in opposition in a case in the court of the Mining Commissioner, who judged in favour of Guest's client. Coghlan, although irritated by Guest, recognised his ability and offered him a partnership, which he accepted, leading to the formation of Coghlan, Welsh and Guest in Salisbury in 1912.\n\nArticle 33 of the BSAC charter of 1889 gave the British government the right to alter or repeal any of the administrative provisions of the charter after 25 years. So it was widely anticipated by all sections of southern African political opinion after 1910 that the BSAC's administration would come to an end in 1914. Yet the BSAC remained in place.\n\nDuring the course of the First World War, Rhodesia's white population was split between the Unionists, for amalgamation into the Union of South Africa, and the Responsible Government Association, for independence. While the RGA was led by Coghlan, the Union Party's leader was Herbert Longden, another lawyer from Bulawayo. Longden, like the British Government, believed Rhodesia lacked the population and resources for an independent state. For Britain, union with South Africa would mean avoiding having to buy out the BSAC, leaving the burden on South Africa instead. After the war, Coghlan noted that the new Secretary of State, Winston Churchill, was determined to achieve the amalgamation of Southern Rhodesia with South Africa. For its part, the BSAC encouraged the Unionists, expecting that it would get a better price for its assets from South Africa than from Southern Rhodesia. Other major corporations were also pro union, since South Africa would be able to provide cheap labour from the south. These interests controlled the local press and were thus highly influential in the debate. With General Smuts, a skillful statesman, also on the side of the Unionists, it seemed unlikely that Coghlan would dissuade the electorate from entering into the Union.\n\nAt the 1920 elections, domestic interests aligned against those of the BSAC, rather than unreservedly in favour of responsible government. The run up to the 1922 referendum was long and acrimonious. For the Union were most of the leading citizens of Salisbury and Bulawayo, the British, South African and Rhodesian presses, the BSAC, and the British government. Against them was the Responsible Government Association, founded in 1917 by Ethel Tawse Jollie. Wallis, in his biography of Coghlan, \"One Man's Hand\", gives him the credit for the victory of the responsible government lobby. Lewis Hastings, reviewing Wallis's book, recalls campaigning with Coghlan and says that he was the undisputed leader of the movement—highly competent, with a clear vision, principled and sincere. He attributes Coghlan's resolve to his years in Kimberley, where he experienced the autocratic rule of the De Beers mining company, owned by the BSAC.\n\nBy 1922, the display of unity by white farmers against chartered rule at the 1920 elections fell apart. The majority of them, mostly ranchers and tobacco planters, who relied on the southern market, voted for Union. On the other hand, Mashonaland maize growers, wanting to retain full share of the local produce markets, wanted responsible government. The 1922 referendum results were 8,774 for responsible government and 5,989 for joining South Africa. The role of women in the defeat of the Unionists was substantial, with approximately 75% of them voting for responsible government, even when their husbands voted for Union. In a letter to the South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, the Company Administrator Sir Francis Drummond Chaplin cited anti-Afrikaner sentiments, particularly amongst women, as a major factor in the result.\n\nBefore 1923, Coghlan had opposed the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, concerned that it would make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895–96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the High Commission in Bechuanaland was maintained, Northern Rhodesia kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One year into his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked a claim to northwestern Bechuanaland. The Dominions Office rejected the claim on the grounds that the Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim for the southern half of the territory.\n\nCoghlan directed his attention to Northern Rhodesia. Howard Moffat, his Minister for Mines and Works, had supervised mineral exploration in Northern Rhodesia twenty years earlier and so knew of the rich copper deposits across the Zambezi. However, Moffat's first public claim on the northern territory, in November 1925, was on the issue of control of the railway, which would grant control of the central African cattle trade. At the 1926 Imperial Conference in London, some degree of control over the railway was granted to Southern Rhodesia. There was also the issue of attracting labour for mines and farms from the far north and this gave impetus to Coghlan's and Moffat's territorial expansionism in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Coghlan called on Britain's Colonial Secretary, Leopold Amery, to give the North entirely to the South or at least the reversionary right to it but Amery refused this request. During his tour of Southern Rhodesia the following year, Amery appeared to give support to its claims to neighbouring territories. But by 1928, after Coghlan's death, both the Dominions Office and the Colonial Office were for maintaining Northern Rhodesia's territory intact, and favoured its association with the East African dependencies of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda.\n\nSir Charles Coghlan died on Sunday 28 August 1927, at the age of 64, of a cerebral haemorrhage. A solemn requiem was celebrated for him in Westminster Cathedral. He was initially buried in the Bulawayo cemetery but, following a petition from Bulawayo Town Council, Parliament consented for him to be reburied in the Matopos Hills, alongside Cecil Rhodes and Sir Starr Jameson, at a ceremony on 14 August 1930.\n\nSir John Chancellor, the first Governor of Southern Rhodesia, after his retirement in 1928 spoke of the progress that the country had made in its first years of responsible government under the stewardship of Sir Charles Coghlan. The country's economy grew, with annual revenue increasing from £1.3 million to £2 million, with exports up from £8.5 million to £12 million, despite setbacks in the cotton and tobacco industries.\n\nThe building housing Zimbabwe's Central Intelligence Organization bore the name of Sir Charles. However, in April 1985, it was changed by the office of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe to that of Chaminuka, an ancestral spirit invoked by guerrillas opposing the government of Ian Smith.\n\nCoghlan was knighted in 1910 for his services to the 1908 National Convention, which led to the South Africa Act 1909 and ultimately the formation of the Union of South Africa.\n\nIn 1925, the rank of KCMG was conferred on him, the warrant having been signed by his friend The Earl Buxton, Chancellor of the Order, who had served as Governor-General of South Africa from 1914 to 1920 and was president of the African Society from 1920 to 1933.\n\n\n\n"}

It has water-soluble and fat-soluble parts, 40 hydroxy groups and 64 chiral centers. Due to chirality and possible double bond \"cis-trans\" isomerism, it has over 10 alternative stereoisomers. It is thermostable, and treatment with boiling water does not remove its toxicity. It remains stable in aqueous solutions for prolonged periods but rapidly decomposes and loses its toxicity in acidic or alkaline solutions. It has multiple analogues with a similar structure like ostreocin-D, mascarenotoxin-A and -B.\n\nPalytoxin occurs at least in tropics and subtropics where it is made by \"Palythoa\" corals and \"Ostreopsis\" dinoflagellates, or possibly by bacteria occurring in these organisms. It can be found in many more species like fish and crabs due to the process of biomagnification. It can also be found in organisms living close to palytoxin producing organisms like sponges, mussels, starfish and cnidaria.\n\nPeople are rarely exposed to palytoxin. Exposures have happened in people who have eaten sea animals like fish and crabs, but also in aquarium hobbyists who have handled \"Palythoa\" corals incorrectly and in those who have been exposed to certain algal blooms.\n\nPalytoxin targets the sodium-potassium pump protein by locking it into a position where it allows passive transport of both sodium and potassium ions, thereby destroying the ion gradient that is essential for life. Because palytoxin can affect every type of cell in the body, the symptoms can be very different for the various routes of exposure.\n\nPalytoxin's planar chemical structure was solved in 1981 by two research groups independently from each other. Stereochemistry was solved in 1982. Palytoxin carboxylic acid was synthesized by Yoshito Kishi and colleagues in 1989 and actual palytoxin in 1994 by Kishi and Suh.\n\nAccording to an ancient Hawaiian legend, on the island of Maui near the harbor of Hana there was a village of fishermen haunted by a curse. Upon their return from the sea, one of the fishermen would go missing. One day, enraged by another loss, the fishermen assaulted a hunchbacked hermit deemed to be the culprit of the town's misery. While ripping the cloak off the hermit the villagers were shocked because they uncovered rows of sharp and triangular teeth within huge jaws. A shark god had been caught. It was clear that the missing villagers had been eaten by the god on their journeys to the sea. The men mercilessly tore the shark god into pieces, burned him and threw the ashes into a tide pool near the harbor of Hana. Shortly after, a thick brown \"moss\" started to grow on the walls of the tide pool causing instant death to victims hit by spears smeared with the moss. Thus was the evil of the demon. The moss growing in the cursed tide pool became known as \"limu-make-o-Hana\" which literally means \"seaweed of death from Hana.\" The Hawaiians believed that an ill curse came over them if they tried to collect the deadly \"seaweed\".\n\nPalytoxin was first isolated, named and described from \"Palythoa toxica\" by Moore and Scheuer in a study published in 1971. They measured that its molar mass is approximately 3300 g/mol. They also identified it to be the substance that was probably responsible for the toxicity of \"P. toxica\", but it was uncertain at the time if the coral also had other toxic compounds in it. It was then assessed by Walsh and Bowers that the limu-make-o-Hana was not a seaweed but a zoanthid coral, subsequently described as \"Palythoa toxica\". Moore and Scheuer were aware of the study that Walsh and Bowers were writing.\n\nIn 1978 by plasmadesorption the mass of the palytoxin was measured to be 2861 g/mol and that it had 8 double bonds. Because palytoxin is such a large molecule, it took some time before the complete structure (including stereochemistry) was elucidated. Uemura et al. solved its planar chemical structure first and published their results in January 1981. Shortly afterwards Moore and Bartolini solved the same structure and published their results in May 1981. Forementioned groups solved the structure independently from each other. Palytoxin's stereochemistry was solved first by Moore et al in June 1982 and then by Uemura et al. in December in a study of four parts.\n\nPalytoxin carboxylic acid was synthesized in 1989 by the group of Harvard professor Yoshito Kishi. Synthesis happened in 8 parts and then the parts were joined together to form the carboxylic acid. In 1994 Kishi et al. succeeded in making the actual palytoxin from this carboxylic acid. The accomplishment of palytoxin carboxylic acid synthesis was described as \"the Mount Everest of organic synthesis, the largest single molecule that anyone has ever even thought about making\" by Crawford in 1989.\n\nSome of the organisms that contain palytoxin or its close analogues are listed below. These are either able to produce these compounds or have been found to contain them in some occasions due to bioaccumulation.\n\nSuch corals are \"Palythoa caribeaorum\", \"P. mammilosa\", \"P. tuberculosa\", \"P. toxica\", \"P. vestitus\", \"P.\" aff. \"margaritae\", \"Zoanthus soanderi\" and \"Z. sociatus\".\n\nSuch dinoflagellates are \"Ostreopsis lenticularis\", \"O. siamensis\", \"O. mascarensis\" and O. ovata.\n\nSuch fish are scrawled filefish, pinktail triggerfish, \"Ypsiscarus ovifrons\", \"Decapterus macrosoma\" (shortfin scad), bluestripe herring and \"Epinephelus\" sp.\n\nSuch crabs are \"Lophozosimus pictor\", \"Demania reynaudii\" and gaudy clown crab.\n\nCertain bacteria might be able to produce palytoxin and may be the actual producers in some of the organisms listed above. Bacteria that have some evidence of palytoxin or its analogue production include \"Pseudomonas\", \"Brevibacterium\", \"Acinetobacter\", \"Bacillus cereus\", \"Vibrio\" sp. ja \"Aeromonas\".\n\nThe toxicity of palytoxin is due to its binding to external part of Na/K-ATPase (the sodium–potassium pump), where it interacts with the natural binding site of ouabain with very high affinity. Na/K-ATPase is a transmembrane protein, which is found on the surface of every vertebrate cell. The sodium–potassium pump is necessary for viability of all cells, and this explains the fact that palytoxin affects all cells. Through this channel, which it forms within the sodium–potassium pump, monovalent positive ions such as sodium and potassium can diffuse freely, thereby destroying the ion gradient of the cell. Once palytoxin is bound to the pump, it flips constantly between open and normal conformations. The open conformation is more likely (over 90% probability). If palytoxin detaches, the pump will return to closed conformation. In open conformation, millions of ions diffuse through the pump per second, whereas only about one hundred ions per second are transported through a normally functioning transporter.\n\nLoss of ion gradient leads to death and hemolysis of red blood cells, for example, and also to violent contractions of heart and other muscle cells.\n\nFirst evidence of the mechanism described above was obtained in 1981 and the proposed mechanism was published in 1982. Because the mechanism of action of palytoxin was so unlike any other, it was initially not widely accepted. This was primarily because it was not expected that a pump which provides active transport, could become an ion channel by binding of a compound such as palytoxin. Therefore, there were some alternative hypotheses, which were reviewed by Frelin and van Renterghem in 1995. The breakthrough research which is seen as proof for the sodium–potassium pump mechanism was performed in yeast cells (\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\"). These cells do not have the sodium–potassium pump, and hence palytoxin does not affect them. But once they were given the DNA to encode for complete sheep Na/K-ATPase, they were killed by palytoxin.\n\nFrom intravenous (IV) animal studies the toxic dose (LD) of palytoxin via IV for humans has been estimated by extrapolation to be between 2.3–31.5 micrograms (µg) of palytoxin. An acute oral reference dose has been suggested to be 64 µg for a person with weight of 60 kg. Acute reference dose means a dose that can be safely ingested over a short period of time, usually during one meal or one day.\n\nIn comparison to IV injection, the toxicity of palytoxin in various animals via intramuscular and subcutaneous injections are 2.5 and 4–30 times higher, respectively. Upon ingestion the toxicity in animals has been 200 times less than via IV. In the table below, there are listed some LD values for partially pure palytoxin obtained from different \"Palythoa\". These values represent the amount of palytoxin required to kill half of the test animals. Values are in micrograms (µg) per kilogram of the animal's weight and have been measured 24 hours after the initial exposure.\n\nAn early toxicological characterization classified palytoxin as \"relatively non-toxic\" after intragastric administration to rats. The lethal dose (LD) was greater than 40 µg/kg. The LD after parenteral administration was lower than 1 µg/kg. However the doubtful purity of this study increased because of uncertainty concerning the toxicological data. In 1974, the structure of palytoxin was not completely elucidated and the molecular weight was a lot higher (3300 Da instead of 2681 Da). A 2004 study discovered an LD of 510 µg/kg after intragastric administration in mice, but histological or biochemical information was missing. (Rhodes and Munday, 2004) Furthermore, palytoxin was not lethal to mice given an oral dose of 200 µg/kg. It was also found that palytoxin is very toxic after intraperitoneal injection. The LD in mice was less than 1 µg/kg. Because toxin-producing organisms spread to temperate climates and palytoxin-contaminated shellfish were discovered in the Mediterranean Sea a study was done to better define the toxic effects of palytoxin after oral exposure in mice. Palytoxin was lethal from 600 µg/kg doses. The number of deaths were dose-dependent and the LD calculated to be 767 µg/kg. This is comparable to the LD of 510 µg/kg referred by Munday (2008). The toxicity was not different if the mice had some food in their stomach. The oral toxicity is several times lower than the intraperitoneal toxicity. One of the possible causes of this behavior is that palytoxin is a very big hydrophilic molecule and therefore the absorption could be less efficient through the gastrointestinal tract than through the peritoneum. A recent study by Fernandez et al. further investigated on this issue using an in vitro model of intestinal permeability with differentiated monolayers of human colonic Caco-2 cells, confirming that palytoxin was unable to cross the intestinal barrier significantly, despite the damage the toxin exerted on cells and on the integrity of the monolayer. The same study also revealed that palytoxin does not affect tight-junctions on such cells. Palytoxin is most toxic after intravenous injection. The LD in mice is 0.045 µg/kg and in rats 0.089 µg/kg. In other mammals (rabbits, dogs, monkeys and guinea pigs) the LD is ranged between 0.025 and 0.45 µg/kg. They all died in several minutes from heart failure. The lethal dose for mice by the intratracheal route is above 2 µg/kg in 2 hours. Palytoxin is also very toxic after intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. No toxicity is found after intrarectal administration. Palytoxin is not lethal when topically applied to skin or eyes. Palytoxin can travel in water vapor and cause poisoning by inhalation.\n\nIn this context, despite an increase in reports of palytoxin contaminated seafood in temperate waters (i.e., Mediterranean Sea), there are no validated and accepted protocols for the detection and quantification of this class of biomolecules. However, in recent years, many methodologies have been described with particular attention on the development of new techniques for the ultrasensitive detection of palytoxin in real matrix such as mussels and microalgae (based on LC-MS-MS or immunoassay).\n\nThe symptoms of palytoxin poisoning and how quickly they appear depend partially on how much and through what route one has been exposed, e.g. if the poison has been inhaled or if the exposure has happened via skin.\n\nIn some non-lethal cases the symptoms in people have appeared in 6–8 hours after inhalation or skin exposure, and have lasted for 1–2 days. In different animals the symptoms have appeared in 30–60 minutes after intravenous injection and after 4 hours of eye-exposure.\n\nThe most common complication of severe palytoxin poisoning is rhabdomyolysis. This involves skeletal muscle breakdown and the leakage of intracellular contents into the blood. Other symptoms in humans are bitter/metallic taste, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mild to acute lethargy, tingling, slow heart rate, kidney failure, impairment of sensation, muscle spasms, tremor myalgia, cyanosis, and respiratory distress. In lethal cases palytoxin usually causes death by cardiac arrest via myocardial injury.\n\nExposure to aerosols of palytoxin analogue ovatoxin-a have resulted mainly in respiratory illness. Other symptoms caused by these aerosols included fever associated with serious respiratory disturbances, such as bronchoconstriction, mild dyspnea, and wheezes, while conjunctivitis was observed in some cases.\n\nClupeotoxism, poisoning after consuming clupeoid fish, is also suggested to be caused by palytoxin. Neurological and gastrointestinal disturbances are associated with clupeotoxism. Haff disease might be related to palytoxin and is characterized by rhabdomyolysis and gastrointestinal problems. In addition to ciguatoxin, palytoxin could be related to ciguatera seafood poisoning in some cases and thus give rise to a number of symptoms in this poisoning.\n\nThere is no antidote for palytoxin. Only the symptoms can be alleviated.\n\nAnimal studies have shown that vasodilators, such as papaverine and isosorbide dinitrate, can be used as antidotes. The animal experiments only showed benefit if the antidotes were injected into the heart immediately following exposure.\n\nThere have been cases where people died after eating foods containing palytoxin or poisons similar to it. In the Philippines people died after eating \"Demania reynaudii\", a crab species. After eating bluestripe herring some people died in Madagascar. People who had eaten smoked fish and parrotfish experienced near fatal poisoning in Hawaii and Japan respectively.\n\nThere have been palytoxin poisonings through skin absorption e.g. in people who touched zoanthid corals in their home aquariums in Germany and USA.\n\nCases of inhalation are also known. A man inhaled palytoxin when he tried to kill a \"Palythoa\" in his aquarium with boiling water. In 2018, six people from Steventon, Oxfordshire, England were hospitalized after probable exposure by inhalation to \"palytoxins\" which were released by coral that was being removed from a personal aquarium. Four firefighters, who responded to the incident, were also hospitalized. The patients presented \"flu-like symptoms\" and eye-irritation. Also in 2018, a woman in Cedar Park, Texas was poisoned when she scraped growing algae from \"Palythoa\" polyps in her home aquarium. Other members of the family, including children, also reportedly fell ill. The woman described intense flu-like respiratory symptoms and high fever within hours of inhalation and was hospitalized. Confused physicians initially misdiagnosed the palytoxin poisoning to viral infection. The toxin also killed most of the fish in the aquarium. Many aquatic hobbyists purchase the coral for their bright coloring unaware of the toxins present and the danger of the toxin if it is disturbed. A similar event occurred in the UK in August 2019 .\n\nA formerly unknown derivative of palytoxin, ovatoxin-a, produced as a marine aerosol by the tropical dinoflagellate \"Ostreopsis ovata\" caused hundreds of people in Genoa, Italy, to fall ill. In 2005 and 2006 blooms of these algae occurred in the Mediterranean sea. All those affected needed hospitalization. Symptoms were high fever, coughs and wheezes.\n\n"}

Adopting the name \"Christian York\", Spence wrestled for the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA), Southern Championship Wrestling, Steel City Wrestling, and numerous other independent promotions across the country. In OMEGA, York formed a stable known as the \"Badstreet Boys\", with Joey Matthews, as well as Shannon Moore and Shane Helms. The group had a boy band gimmick to capitalize on the bubble gum boy bands of pop culture.\n\nEventually, all four members of the group signed three-year contracts with Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling (WCW) after try-outs on \"WCW Monday Nitro\" in the early summer of 1999. They stayed under contract until April 2000 when budget cuts were in order and management changed hands. York and Matthews went on to wrestle for numerous independent promotions, winning several tag team championships.\n\nIn April, they went to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF) for try-outs in Baltimore on \"Raw\" and Richmond the following night for \"SmackDown!\". The office was impressed with their ability but asked if they could send them to Paul Heyman's Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) for more seasoning. Following that date, they were signed to contracts by ECW and aligned themselves with Tommy Dreamer, Joey Styles, and Joel Gertner. York would wrestle on the last ever match on ECW Hardcore TV in a losing effort to Jerry Lynn.\n\nAfter ECW declared bankruptcy in April 2001, York and Matthews were offered a contract from former employer WCW, and were written into the shows for the whole month. They then signed a three-year deal with the WWF. Upon signing the deal, they had to report to Memphis, Tennessee to work for WWF's farm league, Memphis Championship Wrestling, until being called up to the main roster. During their stay, they feuded with Eddie Fatu, Matt Anoa'i, Joey Abs, Lance Cade, Spanky, Bryan Danielson, and The Haas Brothers (Russ and Charlie). During their stay, Vince McMahon purchased WCW, upon which York and a number of development wrestlers were released.\n\nAfter only a few days being released, on July 20, York and Matthews returned to the independent circuit at International Wrestling Cartel losing to Evolution, the match also included the Backseat Boyz. On September 2, York and Matthews defeated the Holy Roller to become the Maryland Championship Wrestling's Tag Team Championship and would lose it in May 2002 to the Slackers. Throughout 2002 and 2003, York and Matthews appeared for Ring of Honor and Xtreme Pro Wrestling and even took on Youthanazia for the XPW World Tag Team Championship. In June 2002, they were signed to contracts by the newly formed Total Nonstop Action Wrestling promotion, after appearing on their inaugural pay-per-view against The Dupps. They were released later that year.\n\nAway from tag team wrestling, York also had some notable exposure as a singles wrestler. Between the month August and September 2002, York took part in 3PW Heavyweight Title Tournament where he would make it to the final before losing to Gary Wolfe. On July 2003, York took part in the Shane Shamrock Memorial Cup six man match which also had the MCW Cruiserweight Championship and the MEWF Cruiserweight Championship on the line. York would line the match and would also unify the two titles to become the MEWF Maryland Unified Cruiserweight Championship.\n\nIn November 2002, York tore ligaments in his left ankle that kept him on the sidelines for three months. He would also have to vacate the MEWF Maryland Unified Cruiserweight Championship. York decided to get out of the wrestling business for a while to take care of life outside of wrestling after marrying his high-school sweetheart.\n\nIn February 2003, York made his debut in Delaware Championship Wrestling out of Delaware. York would team with Joey Matthews winning the DCW Tag-Team Championships. Delaware Championship Wrestling would change its name to Dynamite Championship Wrestling in 2004.\n\nOn July 22, 2006, however, York returned to the business to wrestle for Maryland Championship Wrestling.\n\nOn December 18, 2006, York faced \"Bone Crusher\" Fred Sampson in a tryout dark match for WWE. York also wrestled The Miz on \"SmackDown\" and Chuck Palumbo and Carlito on \"WWE Heat\". He was then asked to report to Louisville, Kentucky's Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), to form a team with Johnny Jeter. York reported to OVW in September 2007, although still not under contract with WWE.\n\nIn May 2007, York made a televised appearance with World Wrestling Entertainment, losing to The Miz on the May 19, 2007 episode of \"SmackDown\".\n\nOn September 29, 2007 in Berwyn, Illinois, York reunited with Joey Mercury, in a losing effort against the AAW Tag Team Champions, The Motor City Machine Guns (Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley).\n\nOn the December 26, 2007 edition of Maryland Championship Wrestling's \"Season's Beatings\" event, York won a number one contendership tag team match with his former tag team partner and then MCW Heavyweight Champion, Joey Matthews after they defeated Tom Brandi and Adam Flash of the Creative Control stable. York later defeated Matthews to win his first MCW Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOn November 5, 2010, York defeated Robert Roma to become the new SCWA Mindshock Television champion. On February 22, 2013, York won the MCW Heavyweight Championship for the second time. He lost the title to Drolix on May 3, 2014.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, York appeared on the premiere episode of First State Championship Wrestling. He faced fellow ECW alumnus Justin Credible in an Extreme Rules match, which he won.\n\nOn November 1, 2012, York appeared on Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's (TNA) \"Impact Wrestling\" program, losing to Zema Ion in a TNA Gut Check match. On the following episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", the Gut Check judges voted unanimously to sign York to a contract.\n\nYork returned on the November 22 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", losing to TNA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Hardy in a non-title match. After defeating Kid Kash and Kenny King in a tournament to determine the number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship, York unsuccessfully challenged champion Rob Van Dam in a title match at Genesis on January 13, 2013. The day before Genesis, York took part in X-Travaganza, where he won a seven man Xscape match which aired on April 5, 2013. That same day, York also took part in Joker's Wild which aired on May 3, 2013, competing in a tournament for a $100,000 cash prize; he teamed up with James Storm to defeat Crimson and Gunner in a tag team match to advanced to the main event Gauntlet Battle Royal, but was eliminated by Rob Terry. York returned on March 10 at Lockdown, unsuccessfully challenging Kenny King for the X Division Championship in a three-way match, which also included Zema Ion. York's last appearance for the company was on the May 16 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", losing to Jay Bradley in the first qualifying round for the Bound for Glory Series Tournament. On July 3, York was released from his TNA contract.\n\n\nYork defended the championship with either Stevens, The Stro, Shields, or Samson under the Freebird Rule.\n\n"}
{"id": "1967710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967710", "title": "Semi-Slav Defense", "text": "Semi-Slav Defense\n\nThe Semi-Slav Defense is a variation of the Queen's Gambit chess opening defined by the position reached after the moves:\nThe position may readily be reached by a number of different . With Black advancing pawns to both e6 and c6, the opening resembles a mixture of the Orthodox Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD) and the Slav Defense.\n\nBlack is threatening to capture the white pawn on c4, and hold it with b7–b5. White can avoid this in a number of ways. About 80% of games continue 5.Bg5 or 5.e3: the former constitutes a sharp pawn sacrifice, while the latter restricts the dark-squared bishop from its natural development to g5. Other possible moves are 5.Qb3, 5.g3 and 5.cxd5, the last of which, after 5...exd5, leads to a line of the QGD Exchange Variation where White's early Nf3 enables Black's queen bishop to freely develop, which should give equality (\"ECO\" codes D43 and D45). It is worth noting that 5.Bf4 is considered somewhat inaccurate, as 5...dxc4 is favorable for black. \n\nFor the Semi-Slav the \"Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings\" designates codes D43 through D49.\nIt is possible to reach the Semi-Slav through many move orders. White player may start the game with either 1.d4, 1.Nf3 or even 1.c4, keeping the possibility of a Semi-Slav open. Black player can choose different combinations of d5, c6, e6 and Nf6 as well in order to avoid certain variations or to open up some new opportunities of his own.\n\nThis chapter looks at the first moves of the game from Black player's point of view, assuming that he would prefer to play the Semi-Slav.\n\nIf White opens the game with 1. d4, Black is happy to respond with 1...d5 when aiming for a Semi-Slav. Of course White can continue the game with 2. Bf4 or even 2. Bg5 (as is the case if Black opens 1...Nf6), and the game will take a completely different path. In vast majority of the games, however, White players choose to play either 2. c4 (Queens Gambit) or 2. Nf3. After 2. Nf3, the natural continuation for Black is 2...Nf6. Playing 2...c6 or 2...e6 might be somewhat inaccurate, since White always has the option of avoiding c2-c4, so developing the knight first makes a lot of sense.\n\nIf White chooses the most common 2. c4, Black has three practical choices: either protect the pawn on d5 by playing e6 or c6 (keeping the option of a Semi-Slav open), or alternatively capture the white pawn with dxc4 (leading to Queen's Gambit Accepted). The first thing for Black players to consider is, what if White captures on d5 anyhow with cxd5. If Black has played the Slav move order (2...c6), then after the recapture cxd5 (\"exchange Slav\") the pawn structure is symmetrical. Should Black have played 2...e6 instead, the recapture exd5 leads to an imbalanced pawn structure called the Carlsbad structure, which might offer White some opportunities for a minority attack on the queenside.\n\nProtecting the d5-pawn with the c-pawn has at least three implications for Black. First, it allows Black to keep the option to enter the Slav defence, i.e., developing his light-squared bishop to f5 at the appropriate moment, before moving his e-pawn. Second, it may discourage White from capturing on d5, given the somewhat drawish reputation of the Exchange Slav. Third, it prevents White from entering the Catalan opening with 3. g3.\n\nOne drawback of playing 2...c6 is that White may continue 3. Nf3, and after 3...Nf6 play 4.e3 (\"Slow Slav\"), and now Black cannot really play the Semi-Slav since 4...e6 is considered to be good for White as he has not committed to Nc3 thus having other options to develop, like Nbd2 or b3 for instance.\n\nProtecting the d5-pawn with the e-pawn allows Black to develop his kingside more rapidly, but it does block the light-squared bishop for the time being. After 3. Nf3 Nf6 White has the option of entering the Catalan opening with 4. g3.\n\nIf White continues 3. Nc3, Black has two options to proceed with a Semi-Slav in mind. First, Black can play 3...c6 (the \"triangle setup\", see below). Second, Black can play 3...Nf6, which gives White the opportunity to continue 4. cxd5 exd5 followed by 5. Bg5.\n\nAfter the move order 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 black has the opportunity to respond with 3...e6 instead of 3...Nf6. This \"triangle setup\" opens up some new alternatives for both players on the fourth move. \n\nFirst, White has the opportunity to enter the Marshall Gambit by playing 4. e4. Play continues 4...dxe4 (4...Bb4 is sometimes played, but should favor White) 5. Nxe4 Bb4+. Now White has two alternative paths to continue. The main line is considered to be 6. Bd2 Qxd4 7. Bxb4 Qxe4+ and then White blocks the check with either his knight or bishop. Alternatively White can continue with 6. Nc3 (as in World Championship match Carlsen-Anand, 2013), and play continues 6...c5 7.a3 Ba5. \n\nSecond, if White continues 4. Nf3, Black has the extra option of playing 4...dxc4 entering the Noteboom variation. If White wants to avoid this variation, he must play either 4. e4 (Marshall Gambit) or 4. e3 (which usually transposes to the Meran, but deprives White of the Bg5 variations). White now has a number of possible continuations, including 5. a4 (see below), 5. e3 (often transposing to the line given below), 5. e4 (with similarities to the line given below), or even 5. Bg5. A typical line in the Noteboom variation continues: 5. a4 Bb4 6. e3 b5 7. Bd2 a5 8. axb5 Bxc3 9. Bxc3 cxb5 10. b3 Bb7 11. bxc4 b4 12. Bb2 Nf6 13. Bd3 Nbd7 14. 0-0 0-0 with an interesting position where Black has two connected passed pawns on the queenside, while White has the bishop pair and dominates the center of the board. \n\nIt is worth noting, that the \"triangle setup\" is not ideal for Black if White plays 3. Nf3 instead of 3. Nc3. Should Black play 3...e6 nevertheless, White has the option of continuing with 4. e3 or 4. Qc2, for example, thus avoiding the Noteboom variation.\n\nBlack has the option of delaying the move d7-d5, for instance to avoid the exchange cxd5. If White continues 3. Nc3, Black has the option of transposing to a Nimzo-Indian with 3...Bb4. Should White choose to play 3. Nf3 instead, Black can simply play 3...d5, and then after 4. Nc3 c6 we are back at the start of Semi-Slav. This move order, however, allows white to play the Catalan Opening with either 3. g3, or alternatively 3. Nf3 d5 4. g3. \n\nRoughly 50% of the games continue with 5.e3. White gives priority to developing his light-squared bishop, and accepts that for the time being the dark-squared bishop will remain somewhat out of play. The main line continues with 5...Nbd7. The bishop moves 5...Bd6 and 5...Be7 are seldom seen, as masters realized early on that at e7, the bishop was passively placed and does nothing to further one of Black's aims, the freeing move ...e5. The unusual move 5...a6 is considered solid for Black. Some sources call 5...a6 the \"accelerated Meran\".\n\nOne of the main variations of the Semi-Slav is the Meran Variation. White plays 6. Bd3, provoking the continuation 6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5 (\"ECO\" codes D46 to D49) where black surrenders his center in exchange for queenside expansion and some tempi against the white bishop. The line was first played in 1906 in the game Schlechter–Perlis. The variation takes its name from the town of Meran (Merano) in northern Italy. During a 1924 tournament in Meran, it was used successfully in the game Gruenfeld–Rubinstein. Gruenfeld adopted the same variation two rounds later against Spielmann, winning as well. White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. These opposing strategies, with the ensuing keen play, have long made the Meran a favorite for enterprising players of either color. An example is Gligoric v Ljubojevic, Belgrade, 1979.\n\nThough appearing in contemporary master play with less frequency than the Meran, there are other possibilities: 6...Be7, 6...Bb4, introduced by the Italian master Max Romih, and 6...Bd6, which was much the most popular line before the debut of the Meran, and espoused by the American grandmaster Arthur Bisguier throughout his career.\n\nAfter the main line 6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5 white has three alternative retreats for the bishop. Vast majority of games continue 8. Bd3, but the moves 8. Bb3 and 8. Be2 are possible as well.\n\nBy playing 8. Bd3 white returns the bishop on this ideal square, where it supports white's strategic ambition of pushing e3-e4 in the near future, and gives White the option of playing Ne4 if necessary. Black's main plan, on the other hand, is to find a way to push c6-c5 in order to free the long diagonal for his light-squared bishop and to get rid of the backward pawn on the semi-open c-file. In practice, black has three alternative moves in this position: 8...a6 (Classical Meran), 8...Bb7 (\"Modern/Improved Meran\") or 8. Bd6 (which often transposes to the lines of Anti-Meran).\n\nMaintaining the bishop on the long diagonal aiming at e6 and f7 squares is an aggressive approach by white. If black is not careful, white will launch an aggressive attack towards the black king with possible knight sacrifices on e6 or f7 in the near future. An example continuation might be 8...b4 9. Ne2 Bb7 10. Nf4 Bd6 11. Ng5, when white is already threatening sacrifices to open up black's position, and black must respond with 11...Bxf4 in order not to end up in trouble.\n\nRetreating the bishop to e2 instead of the typical d3-square has an impact on certain continuations, when the white queen is protecting the d-pawn. An example can be seen in a line where black plays in the typical Meran style: 8. Be2 a6 9. e4 c5 10. e5 cxd4 and now white has the option of playing 11. Qxd4 Bc5 12. Qf4 with a comfortable advantage.\n\nBlack plays the move 8...a6 in order to protect his b5-pawn and threatening to follow up with the equalizing move c6-c5. White cannot really prevent this plan directly, so he must immediately generate some counterplay in the center with 9. e4. It is possible to play also 9. a4, but the move 9.0-0 is a strategic mistake as it allows black to freely push his c-pawn which equalizes the game immediately. Black will respond with 9...c5, after which White has the choice between pushing his d-pawn or e-pawn, leading to very different middlegames.\n\nPushing the e-pawn is the classical approach by white, adopted in several high level games, including World Championship match Kramnink-Anand in 2008. The black knight on f6 has no reasonable squares to go to, so black must continue his aggression by 10...cxd4, attacking the white knight in return. Taking the knight on f6 would favor black, so White responds 11. Nxb5, sacrificing his knight while still threatening Black's f6-knight. Black now has three reasonable alternatives how to proceed. Most popular and tested line continues 11...axb5 12. exf6 gxf6 13. 0-0 Qb6 14. Qe2 with a very interesting position. Black is up a pawn and has a very straightforward plan: play Bb7, Bd6 Rb8 and aim for the white king. Practice has shown, however, that white is doing very well in these positions, but precision is certainly required from both sides. Alternatively, Black can play 11...Ng4, where White might respond 12. Qa4, preventing the capture axb5 due to the pin on the a-file, as well as discouraging Black from capturing on e5 due to the discovered check on the black king. Nevertheless, play might continue 12...Ngxe5 13. Nxe5 Nxe5 14. Nd6+ Ke7 15. Nxc8+ Rxc8 16. Bxa6 Ra8 and white is clearly better but certainly not yet winning. A third alternative is to play 11...Nxe5, and after 12. Nxe5 axb5 13. Bxb5+ Bd7 14. Nxd7 Qa5+ 15. Bd2 Qxb5 16. Nxf8 Kxf8 White probably has a slight advantage but the imbalance in pawn structures will guarantee an exciting game with opportunities for both sides.\n\nWhite has the option of playing 10. d5 as well. This often transposes to the so called \"Reynolds attack\" (described in detail below) after, for example, the moves 10...c4 11. Bc2 Qc7 12. 0-0 Bb7, or some other move order.\nAccording to some sources, the move was first played in 1923. The strategic idea behind this move is to develop the light-squared bishop and possibly play b5-b4 and c6-c5 without wasting time on a7-a6. The move 8...Bb7 was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line 9. e4 b4 10. Na4 c5 11. e5 Nd5 12. Nxc5 Nxc5 13. dxc5 Bxc5 14. Bb5+ and the black king will be stuck in the center. However, it was later found, in particular through the work of Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen in late 1960's and early 1970's, that after 14. Ke7 black is completely fine and might be even better, with a very strong knight on d5 and strong bishops aiming at the white kingside. This forced white players to look for alternative approaches to black's modern treatment of the Meran.\n\nWhite can simply play 9. 0-0, and the game often continues 9...a6 10. e4 c5 11.d5 leading into the so called \"Reynolds Attack\". It is worth noting that 11.e5 is no longer an option as it was in the Classical Meran, since black can respond with 11...cxd4 and now 12. Nxb5 no longer works since black has the option of playing 12...Bxf3 13. Qxf3 Nd5 and the game is very much equal. After 11. d5 black cannot really capture on d5, since the opening of the e-file could be disastrous for black in a practical game (although with precise computer play black seems to be fine after 11...exd5). Therefore black must allow white to capture on e6, and try to deal with the consequences. \n\nBlack's typically develops his queen with Qc7, and he has a choice of whether or not to push the c-pawn to c4. The benefit of pushing the c-pawn is that should white capture play dxe6 and after the recapture fxe6 attack the e-pawn with either Ng5 or Nd4, black has the opportunity to defend the pawn with Nc5. Alternatively black can refrain from pushing the c-pawn to c4, which prevents white from using the d4-square for his knight in some variations. \n\nAn example variation where black keeps his c-pawn on c5 goes like this: 11...Qc7 12. dxe6 fxe6 13. Ng5 Qc6 after which there are many different ways to continue for both sides. \n\nIf Black instead pushes his c-pawn, this opens up several interesting opportunities for white. For example: 11...c4 12. Bc2 Qc7 13. dxe6 fxe6 and now White has two possible knight moves (among other alternatives) to put pressure on the black e-pawn. \n\nFirst, 14. Ng5 has to be met with 14...Nc5 (now 14...Qc6 would lead to 15. Qf3 h6 16. Qh3 - a typical queen maneuver in such positions - with a very strong advantage for White). Now White has a couple of interesting alternatives to proceed. First one is a flashy move 15. e5, played for example in 1994 by Kramnik against Shirov, and a couple of rounds later by Karpov against Kramnik himself. Play continues 15...Qxe5 16. Re1 Qd6 17. Qxd6 Bxd6 18. Be3 0-0 19. Rad1 Be7 20. Bxc5 Bxc5 21. Nxe6 Rfc8 with roughly equal chances for both. An alternative approach is to play 15. Be3 h6, after which White can throw in the even more flashy knight sacrifice 16. Nxe6, and the game typically continues 16...Nxe6 17.e5 Qxe5 18. Bg6+ (the point!) Ke7 19. Re1 and White has a strong attack against the black king, despite being a full piece down. \n\nSecond, 14. Nd4 Nc5 15. Qe2 Bd6 leads to very interesting play, like for example in a game Karpov-Anand, 1998, where the game continued 16. f4 e5 17. Ndxb5 axb5 18. Nxb5 Qb6 19. Nxd6+ Qxd6 20. fxe5 Qxe5 21. Rf5 Qe7 22. Qxc4 Rc8 23. Qb5+ Ncd7 24. Qxb7 Rxc2 with a wild and tactical game. \n\nA lot of theory and high-level games exist on Reynolds Attack and it's different subvariations. As in many variations of the Semi-Slav, the game gets wildly tactical and provides opportunities for both sides. \nContinuing the game with 9. e4 b4 10. Na4 c5 11. e5 Nd5 is still very much an option for white. Instead of captures on c5, white can play 12. 0-0 with some attacking prospects. The most critical continuation is 12...cxd4, after which white can either play 13. Re1 or 13. Nxd4, both giving opportunity for some wild attacks on the black position. With accurate play, however, black should be fine.\n\nWhite has a third option to play 9. a3 as well. The idea is to prepare b2-b4 by white, which would make it more difficult for black to achieve his strategic plan of pushing c6-c5. Black may respond with moves like 9...b4, 9...Bd6, 9...a6 or 9...a5.\n\nIntent of the move 8...Bd6 is to allow rapid castling as well as to increase black's control over the e5-square, which will be critical in many continuations. White's strategic idea in the Meran is to push e3-e4, and with a bishop on d6 Black is always ready to meet this with e6-e5, and typically Black is doing fine after such moves. Play might continue 9. 0-0 0-0 10. Qc2 Bb7 transposing to one of the topical lines discussed in the Anti-Meran section below. In addition there are some independent lines after 8...Bd6, where play continues with, for example, either 9. Ng5 Bb7 10. Qf3 h6 11. Qh3 or 9. Bd2 Bb7 10. Rc1 Rc8 11. a3.\n\nThe main alternative to 6.Bd3 has become 6.Qc2, once a sideline, this move exploded in popularity in the 1990s, in large part due to Anatoly Karpov's advocacy. The idea is to wait for Black to commit to ...dxc4 before playing Bd3. Black commonly replies with 6...Bd6 and now White can choose between a couple of very different continuations:\n\nMost often white players choose the move 7. Bd3. Karpov first played 7.Be2 but it soon transpired that the d3-square gives White better chances. Play usually continues 7...dxc4 8. Bxc4 0-0 9. 0-0 b5 10. Bd3 Bb7, after which white has several interesting options to continue the game.\n\nOne of the \"hot\" positions of Semi-Slav occurs after 11. a3. White intends to simply push b2-b4, which would seriously hamper black's strategic plan of playing c6-c5. White also often looks at transferring his knight from f3 via g5 to e4, which is something black might want to prevent. Black players have tried various approaches to combat white's plan, and the final word on this variation has certainly not been said yet.\n\nIf black responds with 11...a5, he is certainly slowing down white's intentions towards b4, but the cost may be too high: black will never be able to support his b-pawn with a6, and the weakness of the queenside pawn structure will be a permanent problem for black.\n\nAn alternative is to play 11...a6 aiming at pushing c5 next, which more or less invites white to play 12. b4. Now black can respond with 12...a5, and the game could continue with 13. Rb1 axb4 14. axb4 Qe7 15. e4 e5 with very dynamic play and opportunities for both sides.\n\nPlaying 11...Qe7 takes the poison out of white's planned knight transfer, since after the moves 12. Ng5 h6 13. Nge4 Nxe4 14. Nxe4 c5 black seems to be fine. However, after 11...Qe7, white can continue 12. e4 e5 13. Bg5 and white seems to retain some advantage.\n\nA very radical approach by black is to play 11...Rc8, with a clear threat of placing the rook on the same file as the white queen. If white now plays 12. b4 to \"prevent\" black from pushing the c-pawn, black may simply respond with 12...c5!? (12...a5 is the computer preference), and after 13. bxc5 Bxf3 14. cxd6 Nd5 the game is wide open with massive tactical complications and opportunities for both sides.\n\nPlaying 11. Rd1 is a possibility, but it looks like black can neutralize white's play after 11...b4 12. Na4 c5 13. dxc5 Rc8 and the tactics seem to work in black's favor.\n\nWhite can immediately push 11.e4, and black must respond with the thematic 11...e5. Play often continues 12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nxe5 Bxe5 14. h3 with some slight advantage for white.\n\nWhite can begin the thematic knight transfer immediately with 11. Ng5. In such positions, black often has the tactical idea of Bxh2+ Kxh2 Ng4+ at his disposal, but in this precise variation it does not seem to provide anything for black. After 11...h6 12. Nge4 Be7 the position seems very equal, though. \n\nInstead of preparing the e3-e4 push to free his dark-squared bishop, white can also play 7. b3 to support the pawn on c4 and develop the bishop on the long diagonal in anticipation of future opening of the center. Play might continue 7...0-0 8. Be2 after which black has several viable continuations at his disposal.\n\nAnother increasingly common gambit line used in the Anti-Meran is the sharp 7.g4. Popularized by Alexander Shabalov and Alexey Shirov, the gambit destabilizes the center for Black and has been successful for several grandmasters, including Kasparov, who won the first game of his 2003 match against the computer chess program Deep Junior with it.\n\nIf black simply takes the pawn with 7...Nxg4, white will respond with 8. Rg1. Black now has a number of playable continuations, including Qf6, Nxh2, f5, h5 and Nh6, and with precise play black should be fine.\n\nAn alternative to taking the pawn is to simply stop it by playing 7...h6. White will continue with 8. Rg1 anyhow, but black has a number of playable responses.\n\nAnother popular response is to play 7...dxc4, but after 8. Bxc4 it seems that white will retain a slight advantage. Play might continue, for example, with 8...e5 9. g5 Nd5 10. Ne4\n\nThe Anti-Meran Gambit (\"ECO\" code D44) arises after 5.Bg5. White refuses to shut in the dark-squared bishop, instead developing it to an active square where it pins the black knight. The downsides of this choice are that it does not help developing White's kingside, and the pawn of c4 remains unprotected. In some cases, such as the Cambridge Springs Defence (see below), Black aims to benefit from the slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain. \n\nMain Black replies are (in order of frequency in high-level games): 5...h6 (immediately questioning the white bishop's intentions, leading to Moscow/Anti-Moscow variations), 5...Nbd7 (transposing to the Cambridge Springs Defence), 5...dxc4 (triggering the ultra-sharp Botvinnik variation) or 5...Be7 (transposing to the Orthodox Defense of the Queen's Gambit Declined).\n\nThe Moscow Variation 5... h6 6. Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character from the Botvinnik or Anti-Moscow variations. Black has the bishop pair, which gives him good long-term chances, but must avoid prematurely opening the position in the face of White's superior development and central control, as his position is initially solid but passive. Alexei Dreev, for example, has played this line successfully as Black. \n\nPlay might continue like this: 7. e3 Nd7 8. Bd3 dxc4 (white was threatening to play e3-e4-e5) 9. Bxc4 g6 (9...Bd6 is also possible) 10. 0-0 Bg7 and now there are various ways to continue the game for both sides. Black has the bishop pair and no immediate structural weaknesses, but his pieces are still a bit undeveloped, especially the light-squared bishop. White might continue with a queenside expansion, for example 11. b4 0-0 12. a4 with a lively game to follow. An alternative approach is one introduced in a game Carlsen-Karjakin (2009), where white continued with the thematic 11. e4 e5 12. d5 Nb6 13. Bb3 Bg4. This allows Black to inflict doubled pawns for White, but it seems that White is able to get a lot of play against Black's weak c-pawn. The game continued: 14. Rc1 0-0 15. h3 Bxf3 16. Qxf3 Qxf3 17. gxf3 Rfd8 18. Rfd1 Bf6 19. dxc6 bxc6 20. Rxd8+ Rxd8 21. Nd1 and White seems to have a slight advantage. \n\nIn order to avoid the continuations above, Black can also play 7... g6 instead. This makes White's typical plan of e3-e4-e5 a bit less attractive (an example line could be: 8. Bd3 Bg7 9. e4 0-0 10. 0-0 Qd8 11. e5 dxc4 12. Bxc4 c5 challenging White's center). One alternative approach was introduced in a game Kramnik-Topalov (2014 candidates), where the game continued 8. Bd3 Bg7 9. 0-0 0-0 10. Ne5. This could be a strong square for the knight, since Black cannot really challenge it with a move f7-f6, given the weaknesses of the kingside pawns. Game continued 10...c5 11. cxd5 cxd4 12. exd4 exd5 13. Re1 Be6 14. Bb5 restricting the black knight and good position for White. \n\nInstead of the more calm and positional 6, Bxf6, white has the option of retreating the bishop with 6. Bh4. This allows black to capture and keep the c4-pawn, but in return offers white a lot of active play against black's weakened pawn structure and vulnerable king. The game typically continues 6...dxc4 7. e4 (note: 7. a4 to prevent black's b5 does not work, see below) g5 8. Bg3 b5 and black has been able to defend the pawn on c4, but his position is full of weaknesses for white to attack. The Anti-Moscow variation leads to very complicated game, similar to Botvinnink variation in many ways.\n\nNote: In such positions White often considers pushing a2-a4 to prevent Black from defending the c4-pawn with b5. In this particular case, 7. a4 is a mistake. First, Black can play 7...b5 anyway, with the idea that 8. axb5 cxb5 9. Nxb5 Qb6 10. Na3 Qxb2 is very good for Black (there are some other variations, including taking Bxf6 at some point, but Black is better in any case). Second, Black can play 7...Bb4, followed up by b5 and Black is a pawn up and it is difficult to believe White has enough compensation.\n\nWhite has a number of typical plans to attack the black position all over the board. On the kingside, White can consider the move h2-h4, possibly further weakening Black's kingside pawn structure. In the center, White often plays Ne5 and opens up the d1-h5 -diagonal for his queen and bishop, as well as looks for opportunities to break through with d4-d5. It is worth mentioning that pushing the e-pawn to e5 is often not a good idea, since it blocks the white minor pieces. On the queenside, White often plays moves like a2-a4 and b2-b3 to undermine the black pawn structure. All of this is combined with the fact that black king has no strong shelter to hide, so a constant threat of mating attacks hangs in the air.\n\nWhite typically continues 9. Be2, and Black responds with 9...Bb7. This is an important prophylactic move by Black, as White is constantly threatening to push d4-d5 to break through in the center. White now has the option of playing either 10. h4 or 10. 0-0. A typical line after the former is 10. h4 g4 11. Ne5 h5 12. 0-0 Nbd7, 13. Qc2 Nxe5 14. Bxe5 Bg7 with various possible continuations and possibly still a slight advantage for White. The latter often leads to wild complications after 10. 0-0 Nbd7 11. Ne5 Bg7, and now White can choose between two very different continuations. First one is 12. Nxd7, which typically continues 12...Nxd7 13. Bd6 a6 14. a4 e5 and so on. The second one, first seen in 2008 in a game between Topalov and Kramnik, is the flashy 12. Nxf7 (a full piece sacrifice), which leads to a wild attack after 12...Kxf7 13. e5 Nd5 14. Ne4 Ke7 15. Nd6 Qb6 16. Bg4 and White has a great position, strong knight on d6, control over the center and the light squares, and pressure against the weak e6 pawn. Although Black might be objectively able to survive and even convert his material advantage to a win, the complications are huge and whoever is better prepared to deal with the position has certainly the upper hand in practical games. \n\nThe Botvinnik variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. The opening was introduced by Mikhail Botvinnik in the 1945 USSR vs USA radio match vs Arnold Denker. Today, Alex Yermolinsky has an excellent record with the white pieces and Alexei Shirov has been Black's chief proponent in this variation. Although this variation bears Botvinnik's name, he was not the first person known to have played it—Klaus Junge is credited as the actual inventor. Black makes the thematic pawn capture 5...dxc4 immediately. White takes control of the center with 6.e4 as Black defends his extra pawn with 6...b5. The main line of the Botvinnik now continues 7. e5 h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Nxg5 hxg5 (9...Nd5 is sometimes played, and after 10. Nxf7 Qxh4 11. Nxh8 Bb4 12. Rc1 White is objectively much better, but the position is incredibly complex to play in practice for both sides) 10. Bxg5 Nbd7 (10...Be7 11. exf6 Bxf6 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. g3 should be favorable for White). White will regain his piece with interest, emerging with an extra pawn, but Black will soon complete his development, gaining great dynamic compensation, whereas White's task is rather more difficult. White will fianchetto his king bishop and castle kingside, while Black will play c5, Qb6, castle queenside, and can carry out an attack in the center or on either flank, leading to complex play. \n\nThe main continuation is 11. g3, aiming to quickly take control of the long diagonal. White can also play 11. exf6, but after 11...Bb7 12. g3 c5 13. d5 White has given Black some additional options compared to the main move, such as Nb6, Ne5, Qc7 or Bh6, which was not necessary. The 11. g3 move order does, however, open up the possibility of 11...Rg8, and play might continue 12. h4 Rxg5 13. hxg5 Nd5 14. g6 fxg6 15. Qg4 Qe7 16. Bg2 with a slight advantage for White. The main continuation is 11...Bb7 12. Bg2 Qb6 13. exf6 0-0-0 14. 0-0 c5 15. d5 b4 and we have reached one of the key positions of the Botvinnik variation. White now has two main continuations: 16. Na4 and 16. Rb1. \n\nThe most challenging continuation is 16. Na4, where Black has two main replies. The first one, although not the best one, is 16...Qa6, leading to another crazy and forcing continuation: 17. a3 Bxd5 18. Bxd5 Ne5 19. axb4 Rxd5 20. Qe2 cxb4 21. Nc3. The second one and probably the better one, is 16...Qb5, after which play might continue with multiple forcing moves 17. a3 Nb8 18. axb4 cxb4 19. Qg4 Bxd5 20. Rfc1 Nc6 21. Bxd5 Rxd5 22. Rxc4 Rxg5 23. Qd4 Kb8 24. Rxc6 Rxg3+ 25. fxg3 Qxc6 26. Rd1 Qc7 and so on. \n\nWith this somewhat odd-looking move White actually prevents Black from capturing the c3-knight (16...bxc3 17. bxc3 Qa6 18. Rxb7 followed up by 19. dxe6 would be completely winning for White). Black would respond 16...Qa6 and play typically continues in a completely bizarre Botvinnik fashion: 17. dxe6 Bxg2 18. e7 Bxf1 and now either 19. Kxf1 or 19. Qd5 and so on. These positions are highly dynamic and favor first and foremost the better prepared player, although objectively speaking White might have a slight advantage. \n\nBlack breaks the pin on the h4–d8 diagonal and forms a pin of his own on the c3-knight (exploiting the absence of the White's queen bishop from the <dfn>queenside</dfn>). If Black later plays dxc4, there may be threats against the g5-bishop.\n\nBreaking the pin with 5...Be7 transposes to the lines of Orthodox Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined. This move is, however, less challenging for white, at least judging by the fact that white scores more than 70% in top-level games. An example continuation is 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Qc2 0-0 8. Rd1 and white has a comfortable position.\n\nAlthough more than 90% of games continue with either 5. Bg5 or 5. e3, there are some sidelines that are worth a quick look.\n\nThe move 5. Qb3 is an alternative way of protecting the c-pawn. If Black continues with the typical 5...Nbd7, White can play 6. Bg5 and this is supposed to lead to a favorable version of a Queen's Gambit Declined. If Black plays 5...dxc4 instead, White will recapture with 6. Qxc4 (see below).\n\nThe move 5. Qd3 is often combined with the idea of pushing e2-e4 in the near future. If Black continues in a typical Semi-Slav fashion with 5...Nbd7, then White can immediately play 6. e4, and after 6...dxe4 7. Nxe4 Nxe4 8. Qxe4 Bb4+ 9. Bd2 Bxd2+ 10. Nxd2 the game is pretty much even. White also has the option of playing 6. g3, leading to some sort of Catalan setup. If Black plays 5...dxc4 instead, White will recapture with 6. Qxc4 (see below).\n\nAfter either queen move, Black can continue in Semi-Slav style by capturing the white pawn with 5...dxc4. Play will continue 6. Qxc4 b5, and now White can retreat his queen back to either b3 or d3. After 7. Qb3, the game might continue 7...Nbd7 8. Bg5 Be7 9. e3 with equal opportunities. The move 7. Qd3 is an alternative, and Black's best reply is considered to be 7...a6 8. e4 c5 and Black is supposed to be fine after either 9. dxc5 or 9. e5. \n\nBy playing 5. g3, White makes a claim that he's ready to play the Catalan, with the black pawn a bit passively on c6. This practically forces Black to take the c-pawn with 5...dxc4. White will continue 6. Bg2 (6. a4 c5 is supposed to be good for Black), and Black has now two main choices. First, he can play 6...b5, and the game might continue in Catalan style with 7. Ne5 a6 8. a4 (8. Nxc6 Qb6 is fine for black) Bb7 and so on. Second, he can play 6...Nbd7 preventing white's Ne5, which might lead to 7. 0-0 Be7 8. e4 0-0.\n\nDeveloping the bishop to f4 might seem reasonable at first, but in this particular opening it is not the correct approach by White. After 5. Bf4 Black responds thematically 5...dxc4 (anything else is good for White), and is ready to defend the c-pawn with the standard push b7-b5. White's best attempt might be to continue 6. a4, but Black now has the move 6...Nd5 (since the knight is not pinned by the white bishop as it would be in the standard Bg5 lines). White's best continuation is probably 7. Bg5, underlining the fact that this is where the bishop should have gone in the first place. After 7...Be7 8. Bxe7 Qxe7 Black is probably slightly better. If White plays 6. e4 as he would in a Botvinnik variation with the bishop on g5, Black simply responds 6...b5 and this must be a much better version of the Botvinnik for Black since White lacks the usual counterplay with e4-e5 against the pinned knight. Finally, the same logic applies for 6. e3 b5, and white cannot claim having enough dynamic compensation for the pawn.\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

From 2006 to 2015, MUFI had a board of four members, consisting of the three founding members and Andreas Stötzner (Leipzig). Currently the board consists of Tarrin Wills, Copenhagen (Chair), Alex Speed Kjeldsen, Copenhagen (Deputy chair), Odd Einar Haugen, Bergen and Beeke Stegmann, Iceland.\n\nIn medieval texts, many special ligatures, scribal abbreviations, and letter forms existed, which are no longer a part of the Latin alphabet. As few of these characters are encoded in Unicode, ligatures have to be broken up into separate letters when digitized. Since few fonts support medieval ligatures or alternative letter forms, it is difficult to transmit them reliably in digital formats.\n\nTo prevent the possibility of corruption of the source texts, the eventual goal of the MUFI is to create a consensus on which characters to encode, and then present a completed proposal to the Unicode. In the meantime, a part of the Private Use Area has been assigned for encoding, so these characters can be placed in typefaces for testing and to speed up the later transition to the final encodings (if the project is accepted). This was originally based upon work done by the TITUS project, which also deals with Greek, Cyrillic, Georgian, Arabic and Devanagari characters, As of Unicode 5.1, this proposal has been made, covering 152 characters, and most of these (89 in all) have been encoded in the Latin Extended-D block. Others are in the Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement (26 chars.), Latin Extended Additional (10 chars.), Supplemental Punctuation (15 chars.) and Ancient Symbols (12 chars.).\n\n, Junicode (GPL) is the first typeface to cover all of MUFI 4.0, also in its italic face. Prior to MUFI 4.0, there were some 39 code point conflicts with Junicode.\n\nThere are three typefaces that are confirmed to cover all of MUFI 3.0. These are Cardo, Andron Scriptor Web and Palemonas MUFI. Only the last one comes in four faces (regular, italic, bold and both).\n\nLeedsUni supports all of MUFI 2.0. Caudex, which is available at Google Fonts for embedding, claims to support most of MUFI 3.0, but is not listed on the MUFI homepage.\nAlphabetum has an almost complete coverage of MUFI 2.0 and some coverage of version 3.0, in addition to a complete coverage of MUFI 1.0. \n\nTITUS Cyberbit covers all of MUFI 1.0 and includes some additional characters at different places, as it predates the MUFI project.\n\nThere is a project to make available MUFI characters, including version 4.0 ones, in LaTeX.\n\nThe MUFI set includes standardized characters from many areas in the Basic Multilingual Plane and includes named character references (\"entities\") for use in SGML and XML, especially in TEI formats such as Menota. It also specifies many characters that are not encoded in Unicode, yet, in the Private Use Area which is designated for such use. When MUFI PUA characters have been accepted for encoding they are removed from the PUA in subsequent versions. As of version 4.0 there are the following PUA assignments, organized into several sub-areas.\n\nSimilar initiatives have been founded for Early Cyrillic Symbols (\"Cyrillic Font Initiative\", CYFI) and others. They are coordinated in the Linguistic Corporate Use Area (LINCUA). UNZ is a set compatible with MUFI, but it is not a true subset since it contains PUA additions of its own. It is intended for blackletter fonts, their typographic ligatures in particular.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1967714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967714", "title": "Vacuum aspiration", "text": "Vacuum aspiration\n\nVacuum or suction aspiration uses aspiration to remove uterine contents through the cervix. It may be used as a method of induced abortion, a therapeutic procedure used after miscarriage, or a procedure to obtain a sample for endometrial biopsy. The rate of infection is lower than any other surgical abortion procedure at 0.5%.\n\nSome sources may use the terms \"dilation and evacuation\" or \"suction\" \"dilation and curettage\" to refer to vacuum aspiration, although those terms are normally used to refer to distinct procedures.\n\nVacuuming as a means of removing the uterine contents, rather than the previous use of a hard metal curette, was pioneered in 1958 by Drs Wu Yuantai and Wu Xianzhen in China, but their paper was only translated into English on the fiftieth anniversary of the study that \"ultimately led to the technique becoming the world’s most common and safest obstetric procedure\".\n\nIn Canada, the method was pioneered and improved on by Henry Morgentaler, achieving a complication rate of 0.48% and no deaths in over 5,000 cases. He was the first doctor in North America to use the technique, which he trained other doctors to use.\n\nDorothea Kerslake introduced the method into the United Kingdom in 1967 and published a study in the United States that further spread the technique.\n\nHarvey Karman in the United States refined the technique in the early 1970s with the development of the Karman cannula, a soft, flexible cannula that avoided the need for initial cervical dilatation and so reduced the risks of puncturing the uterus.\n\nVacuum aspiration may be used as a method of induced abortion, as a therapeutic procedure after miscarriage, to aid in menstrual regulation, and to obtain a sample for endometrial biopsy. It is also used to terminate molar pregnancy.\n\nWhen used as a miscarriage treatment or an abortion method, vacuum aspiration may be used alone or with cervical dilation anytime in the first trimester (up to 12 weeks gestational age). For more advanced pregnancies, vacuum aspiration may be used as one step in a dilation and evacuation procedure. Vacuum aspiration is the procedure used for almost all first-trimester abortions in many countries.\n\nVacuum aspiration is an outpatient procedure that generally involves a clinic visit of several hours. The procedure itself typically takes less than 15 minutes. Suction is created with either an electric pump (electric vacuum aspiration or EVA) or a manual pump (manual vacuum aspiration or MVA). A hand-held 25cc or 50cc syringe can function as a manual pump. Both methods use the same level of suction, and so can be considered equivalent in terms of effectiveness and safety.\n\nThe clinician may first use a local anesthetic to numb the cervix. Then, the clinician may use instruments called \"dilators\" to open the cervix, or sometimes medically induce dilation with drugs. Finally, a sterile cannula is inserted into the uterus and attached via tubing to the pump. The pump creates a vacuum which empties uterine contents.\n\nAfter a procedure for abortion or miscarriage treatment, the tissue removed from the uterus is examined for completeness. Expected contents include the embryo or fetus, as well as the decidua, chorionic villi, amniotic fluid, amniotic membrane and other tissue.\n\nPost-treatment care includes brief observation in a recovery area and a follow-up appointment approximately two weeks later. These would tend to include tests for infection in case any biological material was not properly removed.\n\nAdditional medications used in vacuum aspiration include NSAID analgesics that may be started already the day before the procedure, as well as misoprostol the day before for cervical ripening.\n\nDilation and curettage (D&C), also known as \"sharp curettage\", was once the standard of care in situations requiring uterine evacuation. However, vacuum aspiration has a number of advantages over D&C and has largely replaced D&C in many settings.\n\nVacuum aspiration may be used earlier in pregnancy than dilation and curettage (D&C). Manual vacuum aspiration is the only surgical abortion procedure available earlier than the 6th week of pregnancy. Vacuum aspiration has lower rates of complications when compared to D&C.\n\nVacuum aspiration - especially manual vacuum aspiration - is significantly cheaper than D&C. The equipment needed for vacuum aspiration costs less than a curette set. While D&C is generally provided only by physicians, vacuum aspiration may be performed by advanced practice clinicians such as physician assistants and midwives.\n\nManual vacuum aspiration does not require electricity and so can be provided in locations that have unreliable electrical service or none at all. Manual vacuum aspiration also has the advantage of being quiet, without the noise of an electric vacuum pump.\n\nWhen used for uterine evacuation, vacuum aspiration is 98% effective in removing all uterine contents. Retained products of conception require a second aspiration procedure. This is more common when the procedure is performed very early in pregnancy, before 6 weeks gestational age.\n\nOther complications occur at a rate of less than 1 per 100 procedures and include excessive blood loss, infection, injury to the cervix or uterus, including perforation, and uterine adhesions.\n"}

He made his professional wrestling debut under the ring name GQ Gorgeous as one half of the tag team Erotic Experience with Pat Day at a live event in Middletown, New York on September 21, 1996, where they lost to The Dudleys (Buh Buh Ray and Spike). Erotic Experience made a few appearances at ECW live events for the next few months as enhancement talents against more established wrestlers. Chetti's first win was against fellow House of Hardcore student Roadkill on November 22 and November 23.\n\nChetti changed his ring name to Chris Van de Lay and made his televised debut on the January 30, 1997 episode of \"Hardcore TV\" against Mikey Whipwreck in a losing effort. He soon began using his given name Chris Chetti in a match against The Full Blooded Italians member Little Guido at \"Winter Blowout\". Chetti soon established himself as a fan favorite and began feuding with the F.B.I., primarily against Little Guido, whom he defeated for the first time at CyberSlam. At Hostile City Showdown, Chetti teamed with Tracy Smothers to take on F.B.I. members Little Guido and Tommy Rich, during which Smothers turned on Chetti to join Full Blooded Italians. Chetti continued his rivalry with FBI over the next few months. He received several title shots against Shane Douglas for the World Television Championship at \"Buffalo Invasion\" and Wrestlepalooza but failed to win the title on both occasions.\n\nChetti formed a tag team with Jerry Lynn as the two defeated FBI in a tag team match at Hostile City Showdown on January 31, 1998. Chetti and Lynn won a rematch against FBI at Living Dangerously, where Chetti made his pay-per-view debut. Chetti feuded with FBI throughout the rest of 1998. At UltraClash, Chetti teamed with J.T. Smith and Tommy Rogers to defeat Little Guido, Tommy Rich and Tracy Smothers in an Italian Vendetta six-man tag team match.\n\nChetti's first major match in 1999 was a win against Steve Corino at House Party. He soon formed a tag team with Nova. The team of Chetti and Nova had their first feud with Rod Price and Skull Von Krush, whom they defeated at CyberSlam. Chetti and Nova then exchanged wins with Danny Doring and Roadkill at Hostile City Showdown and Heat Wave. At Anarchy Rulz, Nova and Chris Chetti fought Simon Diamond and DeVito to a no contest after interference from ECW wrestlers. At the 2000 Guilty as Charged pay-per-view, Chetti substituted for an injured Jazz as Nova and Kid Kash's tag team partner against the team of Danny Doring, Roadkill and Simon Diamond in a losing effort. Chetti and Nova defeated the team of Jado and Gedo at Living Dangerously. Following the win, they entered the World Tag Team Championship picture as they challenged the tag team champions The Impact Players (Lance Storm and Justin Credible) for the title on the April 24 episode of \"Hardcore TV\" in a losing effort. The following week, on \"Hardcore TV\", Chetti defeated Credible in a match, which earned Chetti and Nova, another title shot at Impact Players on the April 14 episode of \"ECW on TNN\", which they lost.\n\nNova and Chetti then continued their success in the tag team division by defeating The New Dangerous Alliance (C.W. Anderson and Bill Wiles) at Wrestlepalooza. At Hardcore Heaven, Chetti and Nova defeated Da Baldies (Angel and Tony DeVito) and the team of Danny Doring and Roadkill in a three-way dance. At Heat Wave, Chetti and Nova defeated Da Baldies in a tag team match. On the August 6 episode of \"Hardcore TV\", Chetti received his first opportunity for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, challenging Justin Credible for the title in a losing effort.\n\nOn the September 3 episode of \"Hardcore TV\", Chetti and Nova participated in a tournament for the vacant ECW World Tag Team Championship, where they lost to Team Me (Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger) in the quarter-final. The following week, on \"Hardcore TV\", Chetti and Nova competed against Team Me and Danny Doring and Roadkill in a three-way dance, during which Chetti turned on Nova by hitting him with a chair and causing him to get eliminated, thus turning into a villain for the first time in his ECW career. This disbanded their team and Chetti cut promos in which he berated Nova and held him responsible for Chetti's downfall in ECW and Chetti aligned himself with Lou E. Dangerously. The two former partners began a rivalry against each other, which culminated in a loser leaves town match between the two at November to Remember, which Nova won. This turned out to be Chetti's final ECW match. Chetti returned to ECW at the company's final pay-per-view, Guilty as Charged on January 7, 2001, where he jumped into Nova's match against Chris Hamrick as the special guest referee to favour Hamrick until Spike Dudley made the save for Nova.\n\nAfter leaving ECW, Chetti participated in several independent promotions, such as Midwest Championship Wrestling, USA Pro Wrestling and Phoenix Championship Wrestling. During his short stay with the aforementioned promotions, Chetti had rivalries with wrestlers such as Joey Matthews, Nova and Balls Mahoney. Nevertheless, little activity in the promotions and a lack of a final contract carried Chetti to a constant change of home promotions, until October 2002 when he signed a contract with Xtreme Pro Wrestling.\n\nOn October 5, 2002, Chetti debuted in Xtreme Pro Wrestling at the event Fallout, which was their second show on The East Coast. He defeated Chris Hamrick. During the next months, he failed to win a match, losing to opponents including Shark Boy, Psicosis, and Super Crazy.\n\nOn November 23, 2002, Chetti proclaimed himself the new ECW FTW Heavyweight Champion, only to lose the title on July 16, 2003 against Danny Doring.\n\nBetween September 2003 and June 2005, Chetti remained inactive for unknown reasons. In his return match, he was defeated by Devon Storm, but during the month of September 2005, he obtained two victories over Danny Doring. His last public appearance was as a spectator at One Night Stand 2005. After sustaining a back injury, Chetti went into retirement.\n\nIn February 2013 it was announced that Chetti would be coming out of retirement to team with Nova at Pro Wrestling Syndicate's April 5 event against Hurricane Helms and Starman. Chetti and Nova were victorious at PWS Supercard Night 2 in what was billed as their last appearance as a tag team.

{"id": "1967733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967733", "title": "Social behavior", "text": "Social behavior\n\nSocial behavior is behavior among two or more organisms within the same species, and encompasses any behavior in which one member affects the other. This is due to an interaction among those members. Social behavior can be seen as similar to an exchange of goods, with the expectation that when you give, you will receive the same. This behavior can be effected by both the qualities of the individual and the environmental (situational) factors. Therefore, social behavior arises as a result of an interaction between the two—the organism and its environment. This means that, in regards to humans, social behavior can be determined by both the individual characteristics of the person, and the situation they are in.\n\nA major aspect of social behavior is communication, which is the basis for survival and reproduction. Social behavior is said to be determined by two different processes, that can either work together or oppose one another. The dual-systems model of reflective and impulsive determinants of social behavior came out of the realization that behavior cannot just be determined by one single factor. Instead, behavior can arise by those consciously behaving (where there is an awareness and intent), or by pure impulse. These factors that determine behavior can work in different situations and moments, and can even oppose one another. While at times one can behave with a specific goal in mind, other times they can behave without rational control, and driven by impulse instead.\n\nThere are also distinctions between different types of social behavior, such as mundane versus defensive social behavior. Mundane social behavior is a result of interactions in day-to-day life, and are behaviors learned as one is exposed to those different situations. On the other hand, defensive behavior arises out of impulse, when one is faced with conflicting desires.\n\nSocial behavior constantly changes as one continues to grow and develop, reaching different stages of life. The development of behavior is deeply tied with the biological and cognitive changes one is experiencing at any given time. This creates general patterns of social behavior development in humans. Just as social behavior is influenced by both the situation and an individual's characteristics, the development of behavior is due to the combination of the two as well—the temperament of the child along with the settings they are exposed to.\n\nCulture (parents and individuals that influence socialization in children) play a large role in the development of a child's social behavior, as the parents or caregivers are typically those who decide the settings and situations that the child is exposed to. These various settings the child is placed in (for example, the playground and classroom) form habits of interaction and behavior insomuch as the child being exposed to certain settings more frequently than others. What takes particular precedence in the influence of the setting are the people that the child must interact with—their age, sex, and at times culture.\n\nEmotions also play a large role in the development of social behavior, as they are intertwined with the way an individual behaves. Through social interactions, emotion is understood through various verbal and nonverbal displays, and thus plays a large role in communication. Many of the processes that occur in the brain and underlay emotion often greatly correlate with the processes that are needed for social behavior as well. A major aspect of interaction is understanding how the other person thinks and feels, and being able to detect emotional states becomes necessary for individuals to effectively interact with one another and behave socially.\n\nAs the child continues to gain social information, their behavior develops accordingly. One must learn how to behave according to the interactions and people relevant to a certain setting, and therefore begin to intuitively know the appropriate form of social interaction depending on the situation. Therefore, behavior is constantly changing as required, and maturity brings this on. A child must learn to balance their own desires with those of the people they interact with, and this ability to correctly respond to contextual cues and understand the intentions and desires of another person improves with age. That being said, the individual characteristics of the child (their temperament) is important to understanding how the individual learns social behaviors and cues given to them, and this learnability is not consistent across all children.\n\nWhen studying patterns of biological development across the human lifespan, there are certain patterns that are well-maintained across humans. These patterns can often correspond with social development, and biological changes lead to respective changes in interactions.\n\nIn pre and post-natal infancy, the behavior of the infant is correlated with that of the caregiver. In infancy, there is already a development of the awareness of a stranger, in which case the individual is able to identify and distinguish between people.\n\nCome childhood, the individual begins to attend more to their peers, and communication begins to take a verbal form. One also begins to classify themselves on the basis of their gender and other qualities salient about themselves, like race and age.\n\nWhen the child reaches school age, one typically becomes more aware of the structure of society in regards to gender, and how their own gender plays a role in this. They become more and more reliant on verbal forms of communication, and more likely to form groups and become aware of their own role within the group.\n\nBy puberty, general relations among same and opposite sex individuals are much more salient, and individuals begin to behave according to the norms of these situations. With increasing awareness of their sex and stereotypes that go along with it, the individual begins to choose how much they align with these stereotypes, and behaves either according to those stereotypes or not. This is also the time that individuals more often form sexual pairs.\n\nOnce the individual reaches childrearing age, one must begin to undergo changes within the own behavior in accordance to major life-changes of a developing family. The potential new child requires the parent to modify their behavior to accommodate a new member of the family.\n\nCome senescence and retirement, behavior is more stable as the individual has often established their social circle (whatever it may be) and is more committed to their social structure.\n\nWith the advent of the field social cognitive neuroscience came interest in studying social behavior's correlates within the brain, to see what is happening beneath the surface as organisms act in a social manner. Although there is debate on which particular regions of the brain are responsible for social behavior, some have claimed that the paracingulate cortex is activated when one person is thinking about the motives or aims of another, a means of understanding the social world and behaving accordingly. The medial prefrontal lobe has also been seen to have activation during social cognition Research has discovered through studies on rhesus monkeys that the amygdala, a region known for expressing fear, was activated specifically when the monkeys were faced with a social situation they had never been in before. This region of the brain was shown to be sensitive to the fear that comes with a novel social situation, inhibiting social interaction.\n\nAnother form of studying the brain regions that may be responsible for social behavior has been through looking at patients with brain injuries who have an impairment in social behavior. Lesions in the prefrontal cortex that occurred in adulthood can effect the functioning of social behavior. When these lesions or a dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex occur in infancy/early on in life, the development of proper moral and social behavior is effected and thus atypical.\n\nAlong with neural correlates, research has investigated what happens within the body (and potentially modulates) social behavior. Vasopressin is a posterior pituitary hormone that is seen to potentially play a role in affiliation for young rats. Along with young rats, vasopressin has also been associated with paternal behavior in prairie voles. Efforts have been made to connect animal research to humans, and found that vasopressin \"may\" play a role in the social responses of males in human research.\n\nOxytocin has also been seen to be correlated with positive social behavior, and elevated levels have been shown to potentially help improve social behavior that may have been suppressed due to stress. Thus, targeting levels of oxytocin may play a role in interventions of disorders that deal with atypical social behavior.\n\nAlong with vasopressin, serotonin has also been inspected in relation to social behavior in humans. It was found to be associated with human feelings of social connection, and we see a drop in serotonin when one is socially isolated or has feelings of social isolation. Serotonin has also been associated with social confidence.\n\nPositive affect (emotion) has been seen to have a large impact on social behavior, particularly by inducing more helping behavior, cooperation, and sociability. Studies have shown that even subtly inducing positive affect within individuals caused greater social behavior and helping. This phenomenon, however, is not one-directional. Just as positive affect can influence social behavior, social behavior can have an influence on positive affect.\n\nSocial behavior has typically been seen as a changing of behaviors relevant to the situation at hand, acting appropriately with the setting one is in. However, with the advent of electronic media, people began to find themselves in situations they may have not been exposed to in everyday life. Novel situations and information presented through electronic media has formed interactions that are completely new to people. While people typically behaved in line with their setting in face-to-face interaction, the lines have become blurred when it comes to electronic media. This has led to a cascade of results, as gender norms started to merge, and people were coming in contact with information they had never been exposed to through face-to-face interaction. A political leader could no longer tailor a speech to just one audience, for their speech would be translated and heard by anyone through the media. People can no longer play drastically different roles when put in different situations, because the situations overlap more as information is more readily available. Communication flows more quickly and fluidly through media, causing behavior to merge accordingly.\n\nMedia has also been shown to have an impact on promoting different types of social behavior, such as prosocial and aggressive behavior. For example, violence shown through the media has been seen to lead to more aggressive behavior in its viewers. Research has also been done investigating how media portraying positive social acts, prosocial behavior, could lead to more helping behavior in its viewers. The general learning model was established to study how this process of translating media into behavior works, and why. This model suggests a link between positive media with prosocial behavior and violent media with aggressive behavior, and posits that this is mediated by the characteristics of the individual watching along with the situation they are in. This model also presents the notion that when one is exposed to the same type of media for long periods of time, this could even lead to changes within their personality traits, as they are forming different sets of knowledge and may be behaving accordingly.\n\nIn various studies looking specifically at how video games with prosocial content effect behavior, it was shown that exposure influenced subsequent helping behavior in the video-game player. The processes that underlay this effect point to prosocial thoughts being more readily available after playing a video game related to this, and thus the person playing the game is more likely to behave accordingly. These effects were not only found with video games, but also with music, as people listening to songs involving aggression and violence in the lyrics were more likely to act in an aggressive manner. Likewise, people listening to songs related to prosocial acts (relative to a song with neutral lyrics) were shown to express greater helping behaviors and more empathy afterwards. When these songs were played at restaurants, it even led to an increase in tips given (relative to those who heard neutral lyrics).\n\n\"See article\": Aggression\n\nAggression is an important social behavior that can have both negative consequences (in a social interaction) and adaptive consequences (adaptive in humans and other primates for survival). There are many differences in aggressive behavior, and a lot of these differences are sex-difference based.\n\n\"See articles:\" Conversation and Language\n\nAlthough most animals can communicate nonverbally, humans have the ability to communicate with \"both\" verbal and nonverbal behavior. Verbal behavior is the content one's spoken word. Verbal and nonverbal behavior intersect in what is known as coverbal behavior, which is nonverbal behavior that contribute to the meaning of verbal speech (i.e. hand gestures used to emphasize the importance of what someone is saying). Although the spoken words convey meaning in and of themselves, one cannot dismiss the coverbal behaviors that accompany the words, as they place great emphasis on the thought and importance contributing to the verbal speech. Therefore, the verbal behaviors and gestures that accompany it work together to make up a conversation. Although many have posited this idea that nonverbal behavior accompanying speech serves an important role in communication, it is important to note that not all researchers agree. However, in most literature on gestures, we see that unlike body language, gestures can accompany speech in ways that bring inner thoughts to life (often thoughts unable to be expressed verbally). Gestures (coverbal behaviors) and speech occur simultaneously, and develop along the same trajectory within children as well.\n\n\"See main article:\" Nonverbal communication\n\nBehaviors that include any change in facial expression or body movement constitute the meaning of nonverbal behavior. Communicative nonverbal behavior include facial and body expressions that are intentionally meant to convey a message to those who are meant to receive it. Nonverbal behavior can serve a specific purpose (i.e. to convey a message), or can be more of an impulse/reflex. Paul Ekman, an influential psychologist, investigated both verbal and nonverbal behavior (and their role in communication) a great deal, emphasizing how difficult it is to empirically test such behaviors. Nonverbal cues can serve the function of conveying a message, thought, or emotion both to the person viewing the behavior and the person sending these cues.\n\nA number of forms of mental disorder affect social behavior. Social anxiety disorder is a phobic disorder characterized by a fear of being judged by others, which manifests itself as a fear of people in general. Due to this pervasive fear of embarrassing oneself in front of others, it causes those affected to avoid interactions with other people. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder mainly identified by its symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Hyperactivity-Impulsivity may lead to hampered social interactions, as one who displays these symptoms may be socially intrusive, unable to maintain personal space, and talk over others. The majority of children that display symptoms of ADHD also have problems with their social behavior. Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the functioning of social interaction and communication. People who fall on the autism spectrum scale may have difficulties in understanding social cues and the emotional states of others. \n\nLearning disabilities are often defined as a specific deficit in \"academic achievement\"; however, research has shown that with a learning disability can come social skill deficits as well.\n\n"}

{"id": "1967744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967744", "title": "Dilation and evacuation", "text": "Dilation and evacuation\n\nDilation and evacuation (D&E) is the dilation of the cervix and surgical evacuation of the uterus (potentially including the fetus, placenta and other tissue) after the first trimester of pregnancy. It is a method of abortion as well as a common procedure used after miscarriage to remove all pregnancy tissue.\n\nIn various health care centers it may be called by different names:\n\nD&E normally refers to a specific second trimester procedure. However, some sources use the term D&E to refer more generally to any procedure that involves the processes of dilation and evacuation, which includes the first trimester procedures of manual and electric vacuum aspiration. Intact Dilation and Extraction (D&X) is a different procedural variation on D&E.\n\nDilation and evacuation (D&E) is one of the methods available to completely remove the fetus and all of the placental tissue in the uterus after the first trimester of pregnancy. A D&E may be performed for a surgical abortion, or for surgical management of a miscarriage.\n\nInduced abortion after the first trimester of pregnancy is rare. Approximately 630,000 abortions were performed in the US in 2015, the most recent year for which data are available. Fewer than 10% of all abortions in the United States are performed after 13 weeks of gestation, and just over 1% are performed after 21 weeks gestation. In the United States, 95-99% of abortions after the first trimester of pregnancy are performed by surgical abortion via dilation and evacuation.\n\nPeople who do not have access to affordable abortion care in their area or who face legal restrictions to obtaining a wanted abortion may wait longer to get an abortion after they make the decision to terminate their pregnancy. When an abortion is delayed, a D&E may be necessary.\n\nDilation and evacuation can be offered for management of second trimester miscarriage if skilled providers are available. Some women choose D&E over labor induction for a second trimester loss because it can be a scheduled surgical procedure, offering predictability over labor induction, or because they find it emotionally easier than undergoing labor and delivery. Both methods offer the option of fetal and placental testing. Although pregnancy loss is emotionally distressing, there are rarely medical complications associated with a short (< 1 week) delay to management.\n\nPrior to the procedure, cervical preparation with osmotic dilators or medications is recommended in order to reduce risk of complications such as cervical laceration and to facilitate cervical dilation during the procedure. Although there is no consensus as to which method of cervical preparation is superior in terms of safety and technical ease of the procedure, one particular concern is reducing the risk of preterm birth. Concerns within the medical community have advised against or at least asked for further research concerning the safety of performing the dilation of the cervix on the same day as the surgery for some or all second trimester pregnancies. The concern is that performing the dilation too soon before the surgery could increase the risk of preterm birth should the woman ever carry a subsequent pregnancy to term.\n\nMost patients will be provided NSAIDs for pain management. Local anesthetics, such as lidocaine, are frequently injected by the cervix to reduce pain during the procedure. IV sedation may also be used. General anesthesia may be used depending on individual circumstances, however it is not preferred as it adds significant anesthesia risks to the procedure.\n\nImmediately prior to the procedure, antibiotics are usually administered to prevent infection.\n\nA speculum is placed in the vagina to allow visualization of the cervix. If osmotic dilators were placed prior to the procedure, these are removed.\n\nThe cervix may be further dilated with rigid dilator instruments (as opposed to osmotic dilators). Sufficient cervical dilation decreases the risk of morbidity, including cervical injury and uterine perforation. Uterine contents are removed using a cannula to apply aspiration, followed by forceps. Tissue inspection ensures removal of the fetus in its entirety. The procedure may be performed under ultrasound guidance to aid in visualizing uterine anatomy and to assess if all tissue has been removed at the completion of the procedure.\n\nThe procedure usually takes less than half an hour.\n\nMost D&E's are performed in the outpatient setting, and can be safely sent home same day after a period of observed recovery, ranging from 45 minutes to several hours. Generally, the woman may return to work the following day. The type of anesthesia given also influences the appropriate amount of recovery time before discharge. There is rarely a need for narcotic pain medications afterwards, and NSAIDs are recommended for home pain management. Recovery from the procedure is typically fast and uncomplicated.\n\nSome women may experience lactation after a second-trimester loss or termination of pregnancy. At this time, medications to suppress lactation are not proven to be effective. \n\nIf the fetus is removed intact, the procedure is referred to as intact dilation and extraction by the American Medical Association, and referred to as \"intact dilation and evacuation\" by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).\n\nD&E is a safe procedure when performed by experienced practitioners. The rate of mortality following legal in the US is 0.62 legal induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported legal abortions. The strongest risk factor for mortality following abortion is increasing gestational age.\n\nRisks of D&E include bleeding, infection, uterine perforation, and damage to surrounding organs or tissues . Hemorrhage occurs following less than 1% of all surgical abortions. Infection rates following second trimester abortion have been reported to be 0.1-4%. The risk of infection is decreased by the use of antibiotics. Rare risks of D&E include uterine perforation, retained products of conception, and rare risk of hysterectomy.\n\nThere is no evidence that surgical abortion causes in increase in infertility or adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies.\n\nComplication rates after D&E are similar to or lower than those of labor induction (medical abortion) after 13 weeks, though few studies exist comparing the two approaches. . . In certain clinical scenarios--severe anemia, for example-- D&E may be preferred over labor induction.\n\nProposals to limit abortion access sometimes target specific procedures such as D&E, though this also restricts access for non-abortion patients, such as those with pregnancy loss. \n\n"}

These would eventually lead to the formation of the UK Special Boat Service.\n\nCourtney was a bank clerk in Leeds, England, before he became a professional white hunter and gold prospector in East Africa. Upon his return to England he wrote an account of his experiences, a book entitled Claws of Africa, Experiences of a Professional Big-game Hunter (published in 1934 by George G. Harrap & Co.) He was also a sergeant in the Palestinian Police Force.\n\nWhen World War II began, he travelled from Africa (where he was big-game hunting) to England to join the Army as a \"commando folding kayaker\". When his ideas were rebuffed, he joined the King's Royal Rifle Corps as a Rifleman. Soon promoted to Corporal, he was commissioned in November 1939.\n\nCourtney became an Army Commando recruit in mid-1940, and was sent to the Combined Training Centre in Scotland. He was unsuccessful in his initial attempts to convince Admiral of the Fleet Roger Keyes and later Admiral Theodore Hallett, commander of the Combined Training Centre, that his idea of a folding kayak brigade would be effective. He decided to infiltrate , a Landing Ship, Infantry anchored in the River Clyde. Courtney paddled to the ship, climbed aboard undetected, wrote his initials on the door to the captain's cabin, and stole a deck gun cover. He presented the soaking cover to a group of high-ranking Royal Navy officers meeting at a nearby Inveraray hotel. He was promoted to Captain, and given command of twelve men, the first Special Boat Section.\n\nCourtney's brother Gruff (G.B. Courtney) later commanded a second section of the SBS. The units carried out several raids during the early years of the war, especially in the Mediterranean, which validated Courtney's idea of mounting small-scale attacks from the sea. Gruff himself took part in Operation Flagpole (World War II). However, heavy losses led to its personnel being amalgamated in 1943 into the new Special Boat Squadron, led by George Jellicoe. Roger Courtney lost his command, became a locust control officer and died of pneumonia in Hargeisa, Somaliland aged 46.\n\n"}

She is also known for her appearances in \"The Sopranos\" as a \"Bada Bing Girl\".\n\nAdamo grew up in New York City, where she worked as a child and adult model for Ford Models. Before deciding to become a professional wrestler, Adamo held a series of other jobs, including tending bar, working as a donut stuffer for Country Donuts, working as a booker for a modeling agency, working as a fitting model, performing as an oil wrestler at the strip clubs Billy Dean's and Goldfingers, and working as a booker for go go bars.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Adamo decided to become a professional wrestler. She was trained as a professional wrestler by The Fabulous Moolah in South Carolina and by Johnny Rodz in New York City. She debuted in 1999 under the ring name \"Elektra\".\n\nElektra appeared on the April 5, 1999 edition of WWF Raw is War, playing one of the Godfather's \"hos\" during his match with WWF Intercontinental Champion Goldust.\n\nElektra debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in October 1999, with Cyrus the Virus presenting her to Danny Doring as a replacement for Miss Congeniality. She went on to act as a valet for Doring and his tag team partner, Roadkill, interfering in their matches and fighting with opposing valets such as Francine. Elektra became known for her ability to flex her pectoralis major muscles, which she would often do while delivering promos.\n\nAt Living Dangerously 2000 on March 12, 2000, Elektra turned on Doring and Roadkill, costing them a match against Lou E. Dangerously's New Dangerous Alliance (C.W. Anderson and Bill Wiles) by unbalancing Roadkill while he stood on the top rope. Later that night, Elektra delivered a promo in which she revealed that she had joined the New Dangerous Alliance. Elektra was subsequently nicknamed the \"Director of Covert Operations\" of the New Dangerous Alliance. At Hardcore Heaven 2000 on May 14, the New Dangerous Alliance came to the ring with Elektra wearing a Mike Awesome T-shirt (Awesome had abruptly left ECW for World Championship Wrestling the prior month and was an unpopular figure with ECW fans as a result). After Lou E.

On the second weekly TNA pay-per-view, which aired on June 26, 2002, Elektra faced Alexis Laree, Erin Bray, Francine, Miss Joni, Miss Sasha, Shannon and Taylor Vaughn in the lingerie battle royal. The final two women left in the match were Elektra and Vaughn, with Vaughn eliminating Elektra to be crowned \"Miss TNA\". This was Elektra's final appearance in TNA.\n\nSince retiring from professional wrestling in 2002, Elektra has worked as a booker for the Satin Dolls strip club in Lodi, New Jersey.\n\nDuring the 2000s, Elektra made uncredited appearances as an extra in multiple episodes of the television series \"The Sopranos\" as a stripper in the \"Bada Bing\" strip club, scenes for which were filmed in Satin Dolls. Elektra and fellow \"Bada Bing\" strippers Justine Noelle, Kelly Madison Kole, Luiza Liccini, Marie Athanasiou, Nadine Marcelletti, Rosie Ciavolino and Sonia Ortega appeared in a photo spread in the August 2001 issue of \"Playboy\" magazine.

English\n\nJames Warren English (October 28, 1837February 15, 1925) was an American politician, bank president, and a staff officer during the American Civil War. He was a postbellum mayor of Atlanta, Georgia, from 1881 until 1883.\n\nEnglish was born in Orleans Parish, Louisiana. His father died when he was 12 and his mother two years later. At the age of 15, he became an apprentice carriage-maker and worked at it industriously for four years while attending night school, when he moved to Griffin, Georgia. He married Emily Alexander and raised a family.\n\nHe enlisted in the Confederate States Army on April 20, 1861, and served in Virginia, rising to the rank of captain. On the night of April 7, 1865, in the company of Colonel Heman H. Perry, assistant adjutant general of Moxley Sorrel's brigade, English received the first written communication from Grant to Lee about a surrender, which happened soon after at Appomattox Court House.\n\nFollowing his parole, English arrived in Atlanta on May 14, 1865, where he later became a banker. On December 1, 1880, he defeated developer H. I. Kimball to become mayor, taking office in January. He served as president of the American Trust and Banking Company (later rechartered as the Fourth National Bank) for thirty years. He also served twenty-four years on the board of directors of the Central of Georgia Railway Company. He was one of the incorporators of the 1883 Fulton County Street Railroad, which would later become famous for its Nine-Mile Circle route to what is now Virginia-Highland.\n\nFrom 1871 until his death, he resided on Cone Street between Walton and Poplar in the Fairlie-Poplar district. The home was torn down soon after he died; it was one of the last single-family homes in downtown Atlanta. Atlanta's English Avenue was named for J.W. English, Junior. James W. English, Sr., was one of the directors of the 1887 Piedmont Exposition.\n\nEnglish was one of Atlanta's most prominent citizens in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was an ardent promoter of a New South, based on industry rather than on cotton. He quickly achieved success in business and politics. He served as a city council member, school board member, the police commissioner, the mayor of Atlanta, a bank president, and owner of several industrial enterprises.\n\nWhile he was not descended from the antebellum era aristocracy and had never owned a slave before emancipation, by 1897 \"his enterprises controlled 1,206 of Georgia's 2,881 convict laborers, engaged in brick making, cutting cross ties, lumbering, railroad construction, and turpentining.\" His \"great personal wealth was inextricably linked to the enslavement of thousands of men.\"\n\nEnglish was most closely identified with the Chattahoochee Brick Company, which manufactured many of the bricks used to construct Atlanta's streets and some of its oldest neighborhoods. Although its methods were nearly identical to those used centuries before, it achieved high levels of productivity and vast profits by subjecting the convict laborers it leased from the city to brutal discipline and cruel deprivation. The Chattahoochee Brick Company was \"the biggest and arguably most abusive buyer of forced laborers in Georgia.\"\nBefore a legislative commission in 1908, former guards as well as workers reported that at the brickyard prisoners \"were forced to work under unbearable circumstances, fed rotting and rancid food, housed in barracks rife with insects, driven with whips into the hottest and most intolerable areas of the plant, and continually required to work at a constant run in the heat of the ovens.\" English countered with a denial that he or any member of his family had ever directed \"any act of cruelty\" against any convict. In fact, he claimed, he had ordered his manager of operations to ensure that \"workers were well fed, well shod, well clothed, and well cared for….\" Although one former guard estimated that 200 to 300 laborers were flogged each month, English angrily protested, \"If a warden in charge of those convicts ever committed an act of cruelty to them…and it had come to my knowledge, I would have had him indicted and prosecuted.\" Another witness testified that if English had come within a quarter mile of the plant, he would have heard the screams of men being beaten. English conceded that the work at the brickyard was so brutal that \"not a class of [free] white labor in Georgia… could stand it a week.\" \n\nEnglish insisted he only used convict labor to do \"work that a white man cannot and will not perform.\" He also employed convicts at a large sawmill, the Iron Belt Railroad and Mining Company, and the Durham Coal and Coke Company, which in 1908 owned leases on 430 convicts. Its operations included some particularly dangerous mine shafts, sections of which were filled waist-high with water. Workers were not provided with adequate timbers for bracing and cave-ins were frequent. Even when materials were provided, they often neglected to use them since they feared, if they took time to protect themselves, they would not complete their daily task and consequently be whipped by bosses who would sometimes embed their lashes with sand to increase the severity of the punishment.\n\nEnglish routinely violated the law by buying and selling the leases on convict laborers and thereby transferring them as if they were slaves. For example, in 1883 he purchased half of John T. Milner's Coalburg mine company and, \"in an overtly illegal aspect of the transaction, a lot of one hundred black convicts.\" A witness before the legislative commission reported, \"On Sunday afternoons, white men frequently met in the yard of the English brick factory to swap or buy black men, little changed from the slave markets of a half century earlier.\"\n\n\n"}

It is located by the Vistula River in Lesser Poland, near Sandomierz. It is first mentioned in historical documents from around 1148. In 1205 the Battle of Zawichost was fought nearby. In 1241, 1259 and 1287 the town was ravaged by Mongol raids. Granted town rights before 1255, in the late Middle Ages it was one of the most important urban centers of Lesser Poland.\n\nZawichost is located in Lesser Poland, near the picturesque Lesser Polish Gorge of the Vistula. The town lies on left (western) bank of the Vistula, 17 kilometers northwest of Sandomierz. It does not have a bridge over the river, a ferry is used instead.\n\nThe town was first mentioned in 1148. At that time it was the seat of a castellan, and a market center, located near the Vistula crossing. In 1205, the Battle of Zawichost was fought nearby, in which Roman the Great of Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia was defeated by Lesser Poland’s army of Leszek I the White, and Mazovian army of Konrad I of Masovia. It is not known when Zawichost was granted town rights, most probably it happened before 1255. In 1257, prince Bolesław V the Chaste gave the town together with 25 nearby villages to the Order of Poor Ladies. In the 14th century, Zawichost became a royal town and the seat of a starosta. King Kazimierz Wielki built a castle here, which guarded the Vistula crossing.\n\nLike other towns in Leser Poland, Zawichost prospered in the 15th and 16th centuries. At that time, it was located along a merchant route from Kraków to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and profited from taxes on goods transported on the Vistula. In 1564 the town had a number of artisans, a town hall and 126 houses. Good times ended during the Deluge. Zawichost was ransacked and destroyed first by the Swedes (1655), and then by the Transilvanians of George II Rákóczi. The invaders burned the castle, which remained in ruins until 1813, when during a flood its walls collapsed into the Vistula. In 1666 Zawichost experienced a great fire and then a plague, in which most residents died. After all these misfortunes, the town never recovered. Furthermore, after the Partitions of Poland Zawichost was located near Russian - Austrian border, which hampered its development.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, the town of \"Starostów\" (later known as \"Prosperów\") was established near Zawichost. Most of its inhabitants were Jewish, and in 1820, Prosperów merged with Zawichost. Since then the division between the \"Polish town\", and the \"Jewish town\" was established. In 1827, Zawichost had 281 houses (most of them wooden) and 2,320 inhabitants. In 1888 it lost its town rights and was reduced to the status of a village, to regain town privileges in 1926. During World War II, German occupiers opened a ghetto in Zawichost, with 5,000 Jews. Most of them were murdered in October 1942 at Bełżec death camp. In 1944, fierce fighting between the Wehrmacht and the Red Army took place in Zawichost, in which most of the town was destroyed.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

He was also an officer in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.\n\nHillyer was born in Athens, Georgia, one of eight children of Judge Junius Hillyer, a United States Congressman and solicitor of the U.S. Treasury, and Jane Selina Watkins. He graduated from Mercer University in July 1854, \"securing honors in all branches of study\". He then studied law under the supervision of his father, Judge Hillyer, in Monroe, Georgia and in 1855 was admitted to the state bar. For the first two years of his legal career he practiced with his father, then set up a partnership with the Hon. Hope Hull until the start of the Civil War. \n\nAt the age of 21, Hillyer ran for a seat in the state legislature, and was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1856. He was sworn in the following January and served one two-year term. Hillyer then served as Clerk of the Georgia House of Representatives from 1859-1860. In 1860 he was selected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois, where he supported the nomination of Howell Cobb for President.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War, Hillyer raised a Walton County company known as the \"Hillyer Rifles\" in the late spring of 1861. The men were mustered into the Confederate Army on June 13, with Hillyer elected as the captain of what became Company C of the 9th Georgia Volunteer Infantry. He and the regiment were sent by train to Virginia and assigned to the newly created brigade of George \"Tige\" Anderson in the newly organized Army of Northern Virginia. Hillyer saw extensive fighting at Fredericksburg (briefly commanding the regiment) and Gettysburg, where he fought at the famed \"Wheatfield\" on July 2, 1863. The 9th Georgia lost half of its 340 men in the fight, and Hillyer's company suffered considerable losses. With all the senior officers wounded or killed, Hillyer assumed command of the regiment for the rest of the Gettysburg Campaign, and wrote the official report of the 9th Georgia's service in the battle. Union General Joseph Hooker remarked that Confederate Captain Hillyer was \"a most able, efficient & gallant officer\". \n\nHillyer resigned his captain's commission in November 1863 to become an auditor for the Western & Atlantic Railroad at the request of Governor Joseph E. Brown, who preferred a military man for the role as the railroad was the main supply route for General Joseph E. Johnston's Confederate army. Early in 1864, Hillyer organized the State Road Battalion (consisting mainly of railroad men) and he was placed in command of the defenses of the railroad with the rank of major. Seeing action against cavalry raiders during the Atlanta Campaign, Hillyer performed well, but the railroad eventually fell to the Union Army. He and his remaining men surrendered to Federal officers on May 10, 1865.\n\nAfter the war, Hillyer set a law practice in Atlanta with his brother, Henry. The two worked together for a number of years before George eventually joined the law firm of Hillyer, Alexander & Lambdin. \n\nIn June 1867, at the age of 32, Hillyer married Ellen Emily Cooley, and together they undertook to raise a family, eventually having 8 children (three of whom died in infancy).\n\nStarting in 1870, he served four years as a Democrat in the Georgia Senate, representing the 35th District, which included Fulton, Clayton, and Cobb counties. He served as the Georgia delegate to the United States Centennial Commission that planned and organized the country's Centennial celebrations and the International Exhibition of 1876. He was appointed to the Fulton County Superior Court by Governor Alfred H. Colquitt, serving from 1877-1883.\n\nIn 1885 Hillyer served one term as mayor of Atlanta, during which time he became an expert on municipal water services, publishing several related articles and serving on the Atlanta Water Commission for many years. Hillyer played an active role in the establishment of the Atlanta University System to provide higher education to the freed slaves. He was on the board of trustees for Spelman Baptist Seminary, as well as Vice-Chairman for the Georgia Railroad Commission.\n\nHe died at the age of 92 and was buried in Atlanta's Oakland Cemetery.\n\n\"My Gettysburg Battle Experiences\" (edited by Gregory A.

Social relations derived from individual agency form the basis of social structure and the basic object for analysis by social scientists. Fundamental inquiries into the nature of social relations feature in the work of sociologists such as Max Weber in his theory of social action. Social relationships are a special case of social relations that can exist without any communication taking place between the actors involved. \n\nCategorizing social interactions enables observational and other social research, such as Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft (lit. \"community and society\"), collective consciousness, etc. However different schools and theories of sociology and other social sciences dispute the methods used for such investigations.\n\nAccording to Piotr Sztompka, forms of relation and interaction in sociology and anthropology may be described as follows: first and most basic are animal-like behaviors, i.e. various physical movements of the body. Then there are actions – movements with a meaning and purpose. Then there are social behaviors, or social actions, which address (directly or indirectly) other people, which solicit a response from another agent. Next are social contacts, a pair of social actions, which form the beginning of social interactions. Social interactions in turn form the basis of social relations. Symbols define social relationships. Without symbols, our social life would be no more sophisticated than that of animals. For example, without symbols people would have no aunts or uncles, employers or teachers-or even brothers and sisters. In sum, symbolic integrations analyze how social life depends on the ways people define themselves and others. They study face-to-face interaction, examining how people make sense out of life, how they determine their relationships.\n\nThis sociological hierarchy is illustrated in the table below:\n\n\n\n"}

As such he was one of the longest serving bishops of the Church of England.\n\nCrew was the son of John Crew, 1st Baron Crew and a grandson of Thomas Crewe, Speaker of the House of Commons. He was educated at Lincoln College, Oxford; ordained deacon and priest on the same day in Lent 1665; and appointed Rector of the college in 1668. He became dean and precentor of Chichester on 29 April 1669, Clerk of the Closet to Charles II shortly afterwards (holding that post until the Glorious Revolution in December 1688).\n\nHe was elected Bishop of Oxford in April 1671 and Bishop of Durham on 18 August 1674. He owed his rapid promotions to the Duke of York (later James VII & II), whose favour he had gained by secretly encouraging the duke's interest in the Roman Catholic Church. Crew baptised the Duke's daughter Princess Catherine in 1675 and was made a Privy Counsellor on 26 April 1676 He was present at the crucial Privy Council meeting in October 1678 where Titus Oates first revealed his great fabrication, the Popish Plot.\n\nAfter the accession of James II, Crew was also appointed Dean of the Chapel Royal on 28 December 1685, staying in post until 1688. He was part of the ecclesiastical commission of 1686, which suspended Henry Compton, Bishop of London (for refusing to suspend John Sharp, then rector of St Giles's-in-the-Fields, whose anti-papal writings had rendered him obnoxious to the king) and Crew shared the administration of the see of London with Thomas Sprat, Bishop of Rochester. On the decline of King James's power, Crew dissociated himself from the court, and made a bid for the favour of William III's new government by voting for the motion that James had abdicated. He was excepted from the general pardon of 1690, but afterwards was allowed to retain his see.\n\nHis tenure as Bishop of Durham saw the first two new parishes to be erected in England since the Reformation. These were at Stockton-on-Tees in 1712 and Sunderland. The Church of the Holy Trinity in Sunderland, now redundant, was the base for responsible local government in the growing port town for the first time since the Borough of Sunderland, created by the Bishops of Durham, was crushed by Oliver Cromwell in the English Civil War.\n\nFrom 1681 to 1688 Crew lived at 43 King Street, Covent Garden. He died in 1721. Crew had married twice: firstly to Penelope Frowde on 21 December 1691; then, after Penelope's death in 1699, secondly to Dorothy Forster on 23 July 1700. Dorothy died in 1715. In 1697, Crew had succeeded his brother Thomas as the 3rd Baron Crew, but had no children and thus the barony became extinct upon his death.\n\nHe left large estates to be devoted to charitable ends, and his benefaction to Lincoln College and to Oxford University is commemorated in the annual Creweian Oration.\n\nHis memory is also perpetuated in The Lord Crewe Arms Hotel at Blanchland, whose community Crew rebuilt. Crew bought the village in 1708 and on his death in 1721 it passed to his trust, which remains the landlord.\n\nCrew also furnished the chapel of Steane Park, Northamptonshire, of which he was owner (having inherited the Steane estate with the Crew barony).\nMuch vilified by the Whig school of historians, Crewe's contributions are now more fully appreciated.\nSamuel Pepys thought well of him, praising in particular his grave and decent manner of preaching:\n\n"}

In October 2017, Schwarzenegger confirmed a rumor that, knowing the script was \"really bad\", he had publicly faked interest in starring for producers to lure Stallone.\n\nThe film brought in $28.4 million in the US and over $42.2 million internationally for a total of $70.6 million worldwide.\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nThe film has an 8% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \"Thoroughly witless and thuddingly unfunny, \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot\" gives its mismatched stars very little to work with - and as a result, they really don't work.\" Rita Kempley of \"The Washington Post\" called it \"\" but stated that \"the concept is actually better for Stallone than the premises of his earlier awful romps, \"Rhinestone\" and \"Oscar.\"\" Clifford Terry wrote in the \"Chicago Tribune\" that the film \"plays like an extended sitcom-perhaps four episodes of \"She's the Sheriff\"\" and also that \"About two-thirds into \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot,\" Sylvester Stallone actually delivers the title line. That's how numbingly awful this is. Give it half a star for being in focus.\" Michael Wilmington of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that the film seemed like Stallone's response to Schwarzenegger's turn to comedies like \"Kindergarten Cop\" and added, \"This is another 'high-concept' marketing hook job—a slick, slow-witted, shiny, 100% predictable movie—and the scriptwriters ... don't have anything richer on their minds than the usual feisty mother-son gags.\"\n\nBoth Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert disliked the film and both gave it a thumbs down in their onscreen review of the film. Ebert said it was \"one of the worst movies he'd ever seen\"; in his newspaper review (in which he awarded half of one star out of four), Ebert labeled it as \"one of those movies so dimwitted, so utterly lacking in even the smallest morsel of redeeming value, that you stare at the screen in stunned disbelief. It is moronic beyond comprehension, an exercise in desperation during which even Sylvester Stallone, a repository of self-confidence, seems to be disheartened.\" Siskel gave the film zero stars out of four and stated that \"if the script of this picture were submitted to \"The Golden Girls\" television show staff it would be summarily dismissed as too flimsy for a half-hour sitcom. There is not one laugh nor surprising moment to be found, starting with the scene where Stallone and Getty happen upon a jumper atop a building and Getty manages to bring the man down safely using a bullhorn.\"\n\nSylvester Stallone has stated that \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot\" was the worst film he had ever starred in. He told Ain't It Cool News that it was \"maybe one of the worst films in the entire solar system, including alien productions we’ve never seen\", that \"a flatworm could write a better script\", and \"in some countries – China, I believe – running [the movie] once a week on government television has lowered the birth rate to zero. If they ran it twice a week, I believe in twenty years China would be extinct.\"\n\nIt was the recipient of three Golden Raspberry Awards: Stallone as Worst Actor, Getty as Worst Supporting Actress, and the film earned Worst Screenplay.\n\nThe film was mentioned when Stallone hosted an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1997; in one particular skit Stallone comes across someone in a terrible car accident (Norm Macdonald) who does not like any of his work and ridicules his films. As he lies dying, he mutters something quietly that only Stallone can hear, and when a passerby (Will Ferrell) asks what he said, Stallone is reluctant to say it until he is grilled some more, at which point he virulently yells \"He said \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot\"...SUCKED!\"\n\nThe title of \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Stop! Or My Dog Will Shoot\" is a reference to the film. That episode involves the Simpsons' dog joining the Springfield Police Force after saving Homer from a corn maze.\n\n"}

This is described by the 'law of Bergonié and Tribondeau', formulated in 1906: X-rays are more effective on cells which have a greater reproductive activity.\n\nFrom their observations, they concluded that quickly dividing tumor cells are generally more sensitive than the majority of body cells. This is not always true. Tumor cells can be hypoxic and therefore less sensitive to X-rays because most of their effects are mediated by the free radicals produced by ionizing oxygen.\n\nIt has meanwhile been shown that the most sensitive cells are those that are undifferentiated, well nourished, dividing quickly and highly active metabolically. Amongst the body cells, the most sensitive are spermatogonia and erythroblasts, epidermal stem cells, gastrointestinal stem cells. The least sensitive are nerve cells and muscle fibers.\n\nVery sensitive cells are also oocytes and lymphocytes, although they are resting cells and do not meet the criteria described above. The reasons for their sensitivity are not clear.\n\nThere also appears to be a genetic basis for the varied vulnerability of cells to ionizing radiation. This has been demonstrated across several cancer types and in normal tissues.\n\nThe damage to the cell can be \"lethal\" (the cell dies) or \"sublethal\" (the cell can repair itself). Cell damage can ultimately lead to health effects which can be classified as either Tissue Reactions or Stochastic Effects according to the International Commission on Radiological Protection.\n\nTissue reactions have a threshold of irradiation under which they do not appear and above which they typically appear. Fractionation of dose, dose rate, the application of antioxidants and other factors may affect the precise threshold at which a tissue reaction occurs. Tissue reactions include skin reactions (epilation, erythema, moist desquamation), cataracts, circulatory disease, and other conditions.\n\nStochastic effects do not have a threshold of irradiation, are coincidental, and cannot be avoided. They can be divided into somatic and genetic effects. Among the somatic effects, secondary cancer is the most important. It develops because radiation causes DNA mutations directly and indirectly. Direct effects are those caused by ionizing particles and rays themselves, while the indirect effects are those that are caused by free radicals, generated especially in water radiolysis and oxygen radiolysis. The genetic effects confer the predisposition of radiosensitivity to the offspring. The process is not well understood yet.\n\nFor decades, the main cellular target for radiation induced damage was thought to be the DNA molecule. This view has been challenged by data indicating that in order to increase survival, the cells must protect their proteins, which in turn repair the damage in the DNA. An important part of protection of proteins (but not DNA) against the detrimental effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are the main mechanism of radiation toxicity, is played by non-enzymatic complexes of manganese ions and small organic metabolites. These complexes were shown to protect the proteins from oxidation \"in vitro\" and also increased radiation survival in mice. An application of the synthetically reconstituted protective mixture with manganese was shown to preserve the immunogenicity of viral and bacterial epitopes at radiation doses far above those necessary to kill the microorganisms, thus opening a possibility for a quick whole-organism vaccine production. The intracellular manganese content and the nature of complexes it forms (both measurable by electron paramagnetic resonance) were shown to correlate with radiosensitivity in bacteria, archaea, fungi and human cells. An association was also found between total cellular manganese contents and their variation, and clinically-inferred radioresponsiveness in different tumor cells, a finding that may be useful for more precise radiodosages and improved treatment of cancer patients.\n\n"}

The selenographic coordinates of the center of this feature are .\n\nThe valley floor is a flat, lava-flooded surface that is bisected by a slender, broken, cleft-like rille. The center rille is a challenging target for telescope observation from the Earth and described as, \"notoriously hard to spot.\" The rille itself is longer than the valley proper, at 196.65 km ± 10.98 km, and has a width of 0.58 km ± 0.09 km and depth of 77.69 m ± 28.07 m.\n\nThe sides of the valley rise from the floor to the surrounding highland terrain, a blocky, irregular surface. The southern face of the valley is straighter than the northern side, which is slightly bowed and uneven. The more rugged edges of the valley lie at the narrow west-southwest end that cuts through the mountain range.\n\nMost likely this valley is a graben that was subsequently flooded with magma from Mare Imbrium and Mare Frigoris. However, the valley could have been formed by stress fractures due to expansion of the mantle or contraction after solidification of regolith. It is not dissimilar to other linear features radiating from Mare Imbrium, and the impact event which created the Imbrium basin may have also led to the stresses creating Vallis Alpes. Lava flooding and thermal or tensional stress fractures are two causes of graben formation.\n\nThis valley was discovered in 1727 by Francesco Bianchini. Its name was confirmed by the International Astronomical Union in 1961.\n"}

A Union Army General, he played a key role in the American Civil War, during which he revolutionized U.S. military transportation, particularly the use of railroads.\n\nHaupt (whose first name was sometimes spelled Hermann) was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 26, 1817, the son of Jacob and Anna Margaretta Wiall Haupt. Jacob, a merchant, died when Herman was 12 years old, leaving Anna to support three sons and two daughters. Herman worked part-time to pay his school tuition, then in 1831 was appointed to the United States Military Academy at the age of 14 by President Andrew Jackson. He graduated in 1835 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Infantry that July.\n\nOn August 30, 1838, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, he married Ann Cecelia (Celia) Keller, with whom he would have seven sons and four daughters. In the 1870 census, Louis, Herman, Charles, Frank and Alex were living at home with their parents in Philadelphia's Ward 10, as were their sisters Mary and Ella.\n\nHaupt resigned his commission on September 30, 1835, to accept a job under Henry R Campbell as Assistant Engineer engaged in the surveys of the Allentown road and of the Norristown & Valley Railroad, which opened in 1835 and 15 years later merged into the Chester Valley railroad.\n\nAt 19, he was appointed Assistant Engineer in the state service and located the line from Gettysburg to the Potomac across the South Mountain which is now a part of the Western Maryland.\n\nIn 1839, Haupt designed and patented a novel bridge construction technique known as the Haupt Truss. Two of his Haupt truss bridges still stand in Altoona and Ardmore, Pennsylvania, both from 1854.\n\nFrom 1840 to 1847, Haupt was a professor of mathematics and engineering at Pennsylvania College. He drew the attention of J. Edgar Thomson who became chief engineer of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Haupt returned to the railroad business in 1847, accepting a position as construction engineer on the Pennsylvania Railroad, and then becoming its general superintendent from 1849 to 1851. Haupt and Thomson designed the Horseshoe Curve (now a National Historic Landmark) which enabled the Pennsylvania Railroad to cross the Allegheny Mountains and reach Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nFrom 1851 until 1853, Haupt was the chief engineer of the Southern Railroad of Mississippi, then became the Pennsylvania Railroad's chief engineer until 1856; in the latter position he completed the Mountain Division with the Allegheny Tunnel, opening the line through to Pittsburgh. He was the chief engineer on the five-mile (8 km) Hoosac Tunnel project through the Berkshires in Western Massachusetts from 1856 to 1861.\n\nIn the spring of 1862, a year after the start of the Civil War, the U.S. War Department organized a new bureau responsible for constructing and operating military railroads in the United States. On April 27, Haupt was appointed chief of the bureau by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, as a colonel and aide-de-camp to major general Irvin McDowell, then in command of the defenses of Washington, D.C. Haupt repaired and fortified war-damaged railroad lines in the vicinity of Washington, armed and trained railroad staff, and improved telegraph communications along the railroad lines. Among his most challenging assignments was restoring the strategic Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad line, including the Potomac Creek Bridge, after its partial destruction by Confederate forces. Despite an inexperienced workforce and other serious impediments, Haupt had the line back in use in under two weeks. President Abraham Lincoln was impressed with Haupt's work there. In a visit on May 28, 1862, he observed: \"That man Haupt has built a bridge four hundred feet long and one hundred feet high, across Potomac Creek, on which loaded trains are passing every hour, and upon my word, gentlemen, there is nothing in it but cornstalks and beanpoles.\"\nHaupt was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on September 5, 1862, but he officially refused the appointment, explaining that he would be happy to serve without official rank or pay, but he did not want to limit his freedom to work in private business (and he privately bridled at the protocols and discipline of Army service). He worked with Gen. Daniel McCallum, a fellow railroad man and later became good friends with John H. Devereux (the Superintendent of the United States Military Railroad at Alexandria, Virginia and later General Superintendent of the Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad). However, he chafed dealing with other Union army commanders. He also preferred civilian crews, including many of former slaves (\"contraband negroes\") to soldiers. His Construction Corps had 300 men divided into 10 man squads by June 1862, and was later enlarged to include bridge-builders, then construction of freight cars, barracks, wharves, warehouses, etc. and extended to Tennessee and accompanied Sherman's thrust through Georgia. Haupt also experimented with bridge demolition using torpedoes (inserted in holes drilled in trusses) and also discussed in a November 1862 report various methods of destroying locomotives (firing a cannon ball through the boiler was irreparable; locomotives with fireboxes drained then fired could be repaired). He also tested a lightweight 2-clamp \"rail-twister\" for use in raids behind enemy lines.\n\nOffered promotion again in early autumn 1863, Haupt hinged his acceptance on three conditions: that a central Bureau of U.S. Military Railroads be established to inspect, direct, and receive reports concerning construction and operation of all military railroads; difficulties with commanding generals be avoided through consultation and cooperation within their departments; the chief of the bureau should be free to move wherever his personal presence was necessary or to attend to whatever public or private business required his attention. The War Department declined to accept such terms. Haupt's appointment was eventually rescinded on September 5, 1863, and he left the service on September 14. During that year as a general, however, he made an enormous impact on the Union war effort. The Civil War was one of the first wars in which large-scale railroad transportation was used to move and supply armies rapidly over long distances. Haupt assisted the Union Army of Virginia and Army of the Potomac in the Northern Virginia Campaign, the Maryland Campaign, and was particularly effective in supporting the Gettysburg Campaign, conducted in an area he knew well from his youth. His hastily organized trains kept the Union Army well supplied, and he organized the returning trains to carry thousands of Union wounded to hospitals. After the Battle of Gettysburg, Haupt boarded one of his trains and arrived at the White House on July 6, 1863, becoming the first to inform President Lincoln that General Robert E. Lee's defeated Confederate army was not being pursued vigorously by Union Major General George G. Meade.\nDuring his service, Haupt developed and implemented \"general principles of railroad supply operation\" and \"also detailed methods of construction and destruction of railroad equipment\". His two main principles were that the military should never interfere with the efficient running of the railroad and that rolling stock should be emptied and returned promptly to enable their re-use as transport.\n\nAfter his war service, Haupt returned to railroad, bridge, pipeline, and tunnel construction. He worked with the Richmond and Danville Railroad then was the general manager of Piedmont Air-Line Railway (from Richmond, Virginia, to Atlanta, Georgia), 1872 to 1876; Tide Water Pipe Line Company, 1875- ; general manager of the transcontinental Northern Pacific Railroad, 1881 to 1885; president of the Dakota and Great Southern Railroad, 1885 to 1886.\n\nHaupt became wealthy from investments in railroads, mining, and Pennsylvania real estate, but eventually lost most of his fortune, in part due to political complications involving the completion of the Hoosac Tunnel. He and his wife purchased a small resort hotel at Mountain Lake in Giles County, Virginia. He invented a drilling machine that won the highest prize of the Royal Polytechnic Society of Great Britain and was the first to prove the practicability of transporting oil in pipes.\n\nHaupt also authored several papers and books: \"Hints on Bridge Building\" (1840), \"The General Theory of Bridge Construction\" (1851), \"Plan for the Improvement of the Ohio River\" (1855), \"Military Briges\" (1864) and \"Reminiscences\" (1901).\n\nHaupt died of a heart attack at age 88 in Jersey City, New Jersey, stricken while traveling on the Pennsylvania Railroad in a Pullman car named \"Irma\" on a journey from New York to Philadelphia. He is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. His son Lewis M. Haupt was a noted civil engineer and professor.\n\nHaupt is a character in the alternate history novels \"\" and \"Grant Comes East\" by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen.\n\nHe also appears in the TV miniseries \"The Blue and the Gray\" by Walter Brooke.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a type of sieve where up to half of all residue classes of numbers are removed, as opposed to small sieves such as the Selberg sieve wherein only a few residue classes are removed. The method has been further heightened by the larger sieve which removes arbitrarily many residue classes.\n\nIts name comes from its original application: given a set formula_1 such that the elements of \"S\" are forbidden to lie in a set \"A\" ⊂ Z/\"p\" Z modulo every prime \"p\", how large can \"S\" be? Here \"A\" is thought of as being large, i.e., at least as large as a constant times \"p\"; if this is not the case, we speak of a \"small sieve\".\n\nThe early history of the large sieve traces back to work of Yu. B. Linnik, in 1941, working on the problem of the least quadratic non-residue. Subsequently Alfréd Rényi worked on it, using probability methods. It was only two decades later, after quite a number of contributions by others, that the large sieve was formulated in a way that was more definitive. This happened in the early 1960s, in independent work of Klaus Roth and Enrico Bombieri. It is also around that time that the connection with the duality principle became better understood. In the mid-1960s, the Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem was proved as a major application of large sieves using estimations of mean values of Dirichlet characters. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of the key ingredients and estimates were simplified by Patrick X. Gallagher.\n\nLarge-sieve methods have been developed enough that they are applicable to small-sieve situations as well. Something is commonly seen as related to the large sieve not necessarily in terms of whether it is related to the kind of situation outlined above, but, rather, if it involves one of the two methods of proof traditionally used to yield a large-sieve result:\n\nIf a set \"S\" is ill-distributed modulo \"p\" (by virtue, for example, of being excluded from the congruence classes \"A\") then the Fourier coefficients formula_2 of the characteristic function \"f\" of the set \"S\" mod \"p\" are in average large. These coefficients can be lifted to values formula_3 of the Fourier transform formula_4 of the characteristic function \"f\" of the set \"S\" (i.e., \n\nBy bounding derivatives, we can see that formula_6 must be large, on average, for all \"x\" near rational numbers of the form \"a\"/\"p\". \"Large\" here means \"a relatively large constant times |\"S\"|\". Since \n\nwe get a contradiction with the Plancherel identity \n\nunless |\"S\"| is small. (In practice, to optimise bounds, people nowadays modify the Plancherel identity into an equality rather than bound derivatives as above.)\n\nOne can prove a strong large-sieve result easily by noting the following basic fact from functional analysis: the norm of a linear operator (i.e., \n\nwhere \"A\" is an operator from a linear space \"V\" to a linear space \"W\") equals the norm of its adjoint i.e., \n\nThis principle itself has come to acquire the name \"large sieve\" in some of the mathematical literature.\n\nIt is also possible to derive the large sieve from majorants in the style of Selberg (see Selberg, \"Collected Works\", vol II, Lectures on sieves).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1967894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967894", "title": "Mediana", "text": "Mediana\n\nMediana is an important archeological site from the late Roman period, located in the eastern suburb of the Serbian city of Niš. It represents a luxurious residence with a highly organised economy. Excavations have revealed a villa with peristyle, thermae, granary and water tower. The residence dates to the reign of Constantine the Great 306 to 337. Although Roman artifacts can be found scattered all over the area of present-day Niš, Mediana represents the best-preserved part of Roman Naissus. In 1979, Mediana was added to the Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance list, protected by the Republic of Serbia.\n\nConstantine the Great (280–337) was born and raised in Naissus. He erected a majestic residence in one of the luxurious suburbs of ancient Naissus, where he often resided and attended to state affairs. Historical records testify it was in Naissus that he passed several laws – in 315, 319, 324, and 334.\n\nAfter Constantine's death in 337, the imperial residence in Mediana was used by several other emperors, either as a place of rest on their long journeys or during preparations for war. Thus, Constantine's sons, Constantius II and Constans, stayed in Naissus in the winter of 340, for they signed an edict there. Later on, Constans used it as a temporary residence. According to the Hieronimus' Chronicles, after Vetranio, commander of the Danubian army, had been proclaimed emperor in Sirmium, he surrendered the insignia of imperial power to Constantius II in Naissus, doubtless at the imperial villa, in 350. \n\nJulian the Apostate unexpectedly spent some time in Naissus on his expedition against Constantius II, at the end of 361. During his two-month stay, Julian wrote from Naissus long epistles to the Senate, to Athens, Corinth and other Greek towns, explaining his policy and seeking support. Valentinian's stay in Naissus in 364 is attested by several imperial edicts. \n\nAccording to Olympiodorus of Thebes, Naissus was the native town of another Roman emperor – Constantius III, husband of Galla Placidia, father of Valentinian III.\n\nIn 364 AD, Imperial Villa Mediana was the site where emperors Valentinian and Valens met and divided the Roman Empire and ruled as co-emperors\n\nThe residence was abandoned after the city of Naissus was devastated by Attila's hordes in 442.\n\nThe residence was erected on flat terrain, on an area which covers over 400,000 square metres, on a high bank, some distance from the river, at the foot of the hills which frame the Nišava Valley, near a thermal water source. There was a street in the east-west direction which passed on the south side of the villa with peristyle and the granary located 150 metres from it. From this street it was possible to approach these buildings. The central area was occupied by the villa with its open peristyle, nymphaeum and thermae; to the west of the villa was the granary, and somewhat to the north a spacious building with octagonal and circular rooms. To the south of the villa are the remains of several villas and functional service structures. What strikes the eye is that the luxurious buildings of solid material with columns, decorated with marble facing, mosaics and frescoes, are concentrated mainly around the central villa and its peristyle, while the economic buildings are located to the west of the granary towards Naissus.\n\nThe villa occupies the central position in Mediana. The villa comprises an area of about 6.000 m² (98,6 x 63 m) and included thermae on the west side and a smaller nymphaeum on the east side. The longitudinal axis of the villa is in the north-south direction. The whole northern part was heated. The villa was luxuriously decorated, to which testify the marble columns, basis and capitals of different sizes, reliefs on pilaster capitals and parapet slabs, the remains of wall covering of expensive, multicoloured marble, frescoes, etc. The mosaic floors that covered the whole of the peristyle porch (450 m²) and the audience room have been well preserved. The porch mosaics are geometrical. Figural mosaics are at the entrance of the audience room. The middle part of the audience hall is covered with a broad rectangular field with a geometric pattern, done in the manner of the finest artist. The central part of this structure is a hexagon (3,2 m on the side) with a fountain in the middle, also in the form of hexagon. The lead pipe, used to supply water, can be seen in the middle of the fountain. Smaller spaces surround the hexagon; one of their sides is the polygon of the hexagon. The floor of the nymphaeum is covered with mosaic. The wide outer frame of the hexagon is covered with alternating stylized lotus flowers, and is underlined on the inner side, by a triple border. The lateral spaces about the hexagon are also decorated by mosaic.\n\nThermae are situated northwest of the villa and were probably connected to it. The entrance to the bath is from the south side. The thermae of Mediana were probably used by the owners of the villa, who could reach them directly from their rooms. The corridor on the way to the baths is decorated by floor mosaics, with geometric patterns of the same quality as the mosaics in the peristyle. The vestibule and apodyterium are covered by brick and the middle room is partly covered with brick and partly with mosaic made here of larger white marble tessarae.\n\nThe Granary (\"horreum\") is located about 150 metres west of the villa. This is a spacious rectangular building (91 x 27 m), with the longitudinal axis oriented east-west. Along the west wall there were basins 1.40 m deep, which served for storing liquids, (olive oil and wine).\n\nA water tower (\"castellum aquae\") was ordinarily found at the end of each Roman aqueduct. Water was supplied from this reservoir to the wells and fountains, basins, thermae and maybe the irrigation canals. Its longitudinal axis is oriented north-south. There is a 10-meter height differential between the water tower site and the valley in which the Mediana buildings are located, providing a head for the fountains.\n\nTwo Early Christian churches have been excavated, both built simultaneously sometime after 378.\nThe first church was unearthed in 2000, when a monogram of Jesus was found. Only 8 metres south of the first, a second church was excavated in 2007, among the findings was a bronze ring with a cross. The findings are evidence of Mediana being a highly Christian community.\n\nAs of July 2019 the site is closed for visitors with information it is under construction works but without a re-opening date indicated.\n\n\n"}

C.\" Penney Jr. (September 16, 1875 – February 12, 1971) was an American businessman and entrepreneur who founded the J. C. Penney stores in 1902.\n\nJ.C. Penney was born on September 16, 1875, on a farm outside of Hamilton, Caldwell County, Missouri. He was the seventh of twelve children, only six of whom lived to adulthood, born to James Cash Penney, Sr. and Mary Frances (born Paxton) Penney. Penney's father was a Baptist preacher and farmer whose strict discipline included making his son pay for his own clothing once he reached his late pre-teens.\n\nAfter graduation from Hamilton High School, Penney intended to attend college with the hopes of becoming a lawyer. However, his father's untimely death forced a change in plans, and Penney was forced to take a job as a store clerk to help support the family. Penney's health problems caused him to venture west to Longmont, Colorado.\n\nIn 1898, James Cash Penney began working for a small chain of stores in the western United States called the Golden Rule stores. In 1902, owners Guy Johnson and Thomas Callahan, impressed by his work ethic and salesmanship, offered him one-third partnership in a new store he would open. Penney invested $2,000 and moved to Kemmerer, Wyoming, to open a store there. He participated in opening two more stores, and when Callahan and Johnson dissolved their partnership in 1907 he purchased full interest in all three stores.\n\nBy 1912, there were 34 stores in the Rocky Mountain States. In 1913, he moved the company to the Kearns Building in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. The company was incorporated under the new name, J. C. Penney Company. In 1916, he began to expand the chain east of the Mississippi and during the 1920s, the Penney company expanded nationwide, with 120 stores in 1920 (mostly still in the west). By 1924, Penney reported income of more than $1 million annually. The number of stores reached 1,400 by 1929. The large income allowed him to be heavily involved in many philanthropic causes during the 1920s. By 1921 he had a home (Belle Isle) on Biscayne Bay in Miami. Penney and partner Ralph W. Gwinn had invested heavily in Florida real estate including in Clay County. Some of this land became Penney Farms. This was also the start of Foremost Dairy Products Inc. Penney later recruited Paul E. Reinhold to run the dairy. Most of this work was halted when the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression left Penney in financial ruin.\n\nAfter the crash, Penney lost virtually all of his personal wealth and borrowed against his life insurance policies to help the company meet its payroll. The financial setbacks took a toll on his health, and he checked himself into the Battle Creek Sanitarium for treatment. After hearing the hymn \"God Will Take Care of You\" (written by Civilla Durfee Martin) being sung at a service in the hospital's chapel, he became a born-again Christian.\n\nEven after relinquishing daily operating management of the company, Penney continued his active involvement in managing the company and its stores. In 1940, during a visit to a store in Des Moines, Iowa, he trained a young Sam Walton on how to wrap packages with a minimal amount of paper and ribbon. He remained chairman of the board until 1946, and after that, as honorary chairman until his death in 1971. Until the end of his life, he continued to go to his offices. He also subscribed to what was called \"Blue Laws\". His stores were closed on Sunday so employees could attend church.\n\nPenney was married three times. His first marriage, to Bertha Alva Hess (1869–1910) in 1899, produced two sons before her death from pneumonia:\n\n\nAfter Bertha's death in 1910, he married Mary Hortense Kimball (d. 1923) in July 1919. Mary gave birth to their son before her death of unspecified medical issues:\n\n\nIn 1926, Penney married Caroline Marie Autenrieth (1895–1992). She was badly hurt in 1928 when she fell from a horse at their estate in White Plains. They had two daughters:\n\n\nPenney lived in New York City at 888 Park Avenue, though he spent the winters in Palm Springs, California. On December 26, 1970, Penney fell and fractured his hip. Just a few weeks later, he suffered a heart attack and never fully recovered. He died on February 12, 1971. The Reverend Dr. Norman Vincent Peale delivered the eulogy at the funeral. Penney was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City, not far from that of fellow retail entrepreneur, F. W. Woolworth. His estate was valued at approximately $35 million.\n\nPenney was a Freemason most of his adult life, being initiated into Wasatch Lodge No. 1 Free and Accepted Masons of Utah, on April 18, 1911. A member of both the Scottish and York Rites, Penney was coroneted a 33rd Degree on October 16, 1945, and received the Gold Distinguished Service Award by the General Grand Chapter, Royal Arch Masons, in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1958. He typically wore a large ring showing his Masonic degree.\n\nPenney was a member of two professional collegiate fraternities: Alpha Gamma Rho for agriculture and Alpha Kappa Psi for business.\n\nPenney was involved with the founding of the University of Miami and served on its Board of Trustees from 1926 to 1930.\n\nAt the end of the Great Depression, Penney teamed with Thomas J. Watson, President and Founder of IBM, Arthur Godfrey, the radio and TV personality; and Norman Vincent Peale, a minister, inspirational speaker, and author of The Power of Positive Thinking, to help Henry Simler, an executive with the Remington Rand company. form the first board of 40Plus, an organization that helps unemployed managers and executives.\n\nPenney founded the James C. Penney Foundation in 1954. The foundation was restructured in 1999 as the Penney Family Fund, and is no longer affiliated with J.C. Penney Co., Inc., or its corporate giving program. Today, the fund is part of the Common Counsel Foundation, an Oakland, California, consortium of family philanthropic foundations and individual donors. The Penney Family Fund endows organizations in Oregon, California, and Washington State that work to advance human rights, community social, political, economic empowerment, government accountability, and environmental sustainability.\n\nIn 1960 Penney teamed up with the University of Missouri to establish the Penney-Missouri Awards to recognize excellence in Women's Page journalism, hoping to improve the sections where his stores most often advertised.\n\n\n\n"}

The company was the prototype for other local illuminating companies that were established in the United States during the 1880s.\nOn September 4, 1882, Edison's first central station, the Pearl Street Station, opened at 257 Pearl Street in Manhattan. The station was the first commercial power plant in the United States, and was the world's first cogeneration plant. The plant burned down on January 2 1890. Only 1 dynamo (or generator) survived, and is currently displayed at the Henry Ford Museum. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers designated it as a milestone in 2011.\nIn November 1882, the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Shamokin, Pennsylvania was established. In 1883, it became only the second three-wire electrical station in the world. The first was Edison's plant in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, which opened on July 4, 1883. The opening ceremony was attended by Edison himself. Even today, Edison's presence is remembered throughout the town, with the Edison Hotel and a monument just outside Sunbury. On October 1, 1883, the Brockton Edison Electric Illuminating Company Power Station, another three-wire plant, opened in Brockton, Massachusetts and was capable of supplying about 1600 lamps. The Brockton station is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\nOn November 17, 1883, the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania was founded. This was the first isolated electrical plant in the world, meaning that the entirety of Mount Carmel was powered by electricity. 38 arc lamps and 50 incandescent light bulbs were erected in the downtown business district. Edison also opened plants in Fall River, Massachusetts (1883), Cumberland, Maryland (1884), Tamaqua, Pennsylvania (1885), and Boston (1886).\nThe Edison Illuminating Company was purchased by Consolidated Gas in 1901. In 1936, with electricity sales far outpacing gas sales, the company changed its name to Consolidated Edison. Today, Con Ed is a multi-billion dollar company that provides power to around 3.3 million people.\nIn 1891, Henry Ford became an engineer with the Edison Illuminating Company, and was promoted to Chief Engineer in 1893. He left the company on August 15, 1899 to focus on automobile manufacturing. James Hood Wright was a board member of the company.\n"}

{"id": "1967910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967910", "title": "AMD CrossFire", "text": "AMD CrossFire\n\nAMD CrossFire (also known as CrossFireX) is a brand name for the multi-GPU technology by Advanced Micro Devices, originally developed by ATI Technologies. The technology allows up to four GPUs to be used in a single computer to improve graphics performance.\n\nAssociated technology used in mobile computers with external graphics cards, such as in laptops or notebooks, is called AMD Hybrid Graphics.\n\nThe CrossFire brand name was retired by AMD in September 2017, however the company continues to develop and support the technology for DirectX 11 applications.\n\nCrossFire was first made available to the public on September 27, 2005. The system required a CrossFire-compliant motherboard with a pair of ATI Radeon PCI Express (PCIe) graphics cards. Radeon x800s, x850s, x1800s and x1900s came in a regular edition, and a \"CrossFire Edition\" which has \"master\" capability built into the hardware. \"Master\" capability is a term used for 5 extra image compositing chips, which combine the output of both cards. One had to buy a Master card, and pair it with a regular card from the same series. The Master card shipped with a proprietary DVI Y-dongle, which plugged into the primary DVI ports on both cards, and into the monitor cable. This dongle serves as the main link between both cards, sending incomplete images between them, and complete images to the monitor. Low-end Radeon x1300 and x1600 cards have no \"CrossFire Edition\" but are enabled via software, with communication forwarded via the standard PCI Express slots on the motherboard. ATI currently has not created the infrastructure to allow FireGL cards to be set up in a CrossFire configuration. The \"slave\" graphics card needed to be from the same family as the \"master\".\n\nAn example of a limitation in regard to a Master-card configuration would be the first-generation CrossFire implementation in the Radeon X850 XT . Because it used a compositing chip from Silicon Image (SiI 163B TMDS), the maximum resolution on an X850 CrossFire setup was limited to 1600×1200 at 60 Hz, or 1920×1440 at 52 Hz. This was considered a problem for CRT owners wishing to use CrossFire to play games at high resolutions, or owners of Widescreen LCD monitors. As many people found a 60 Hz refresh rate with a CRT to strain one's eyes, the practical resolution limit became 1280×1024, which did not push CrossFire enough to justify the cost. The next generation of CrossFire, as employed by the X1800 Master cards, used two sets of compositing chips and a custom double density dual-link DVI Y-dongle to double the bandwidth between cards, raising the maximum resolution and refresh rate to far higher levels.\n\nWhen used with ATI's \"CrossFire Xpress 3200\" motherboard chipset, the \"master\" card is no longer required for every \"CrossFire Ready\" card (with the exception of the Radeon X1900 series). With the CrossFire Xpress 3200, two normal cards can be run in a Crossfire setup, using the PCI Express bus for communications. This is similar to X1300 CrossFire, which also uses PCI Express, except that the Xpress 3200 had been built for low-latency and high-speed communication between graphics cards. While performance was impacted, this move was viewed as an overall improvement in market strategy, because Crossfire Master cards were expensive, in high demand, and largely unavailable at the retail level.\n\nAlthough the CrossFire Xpress 3200 chipset is indeed capable of CrossFire through the PCI Express bus for every Radeon series below the X1900s, the driver accommodations for this CrossFire method have not yet materialized for the X1800 series. ATI has said that future revisions of the Catalyst driver suite will contain what is required for X1800 dongleless CrossFire, but has not yet mentioned a specific date.\n\nWith the release of the Radeon X1950 Pro (RV570 GPU), ATI has completely revised CrossFire's connection infrastructure to further eliminate the need for past Y-dongle/Master card and slave card configurations for CrossFire to operate. ATI's CrossFire connector (CrossFire Bridge Interconnect, or CFBI link) is now a ribbon-like connector attached to the top of each graphics adapter, similar to nVidia's SLI bridges, but different in physical and logical natures. As such, Master Cards no longer exist, and are not required for maximum performance. Two dongles can be used per card; these were put to full use with the release of CrossFireX. Radeon HD 2900 and HD 3000 series cards use the same ribbon connectors, but the HD 3800 series of cards only require one ribbon connector, to facilitate CrossFireX. Unlike older series of Radeon cards, different HD 3800 series cards can be combined in CrossFireX, each with separate clock control.\n\nSince the release of the codenamed \"Spider\" desktop platform from AMD on November 19, 2007, the CrossFire setup has been updated with support for a maximum of four video cards with the 790FX chipset; the CrossFire branding was then changed to \"ATI CrossFireX\". The setup, which, according to internal testing by AMD, will bring at least 3.2x performance increase in several games and applications which required massive graphics capabilities of the computer system, is targeted to the enthusiast market.\n\nA later development to the CrossFire infrastructure includes a dual GPUs with on-board PCI Express bridge that was released in early 2008, the Radeon HD 3870 X2 and later in Radeon HD 4870 X2 graphics cards, featuring only one CrossFire connector for dual card, four GPU scalability. When using two GPUs on board the same system, the HDMI ports on the GPUs cannot both work at the same time.\n\nAn earlier CrossFireX and chipset compatibility chart is shown here:\nThe latest compatibility charts, as of April 2014, shows AMD 890, 990 and A75 chipsets—and many Intel chipsets including Z68 and X79 chipsets—as being compatible with CrossFireX; they also show which GPU cards may be paired with an external bridge (HD 7750, HD 5750, HD 4350, HD 4550, HD 4650, HD 4670 cards may be paired without an external bridge, though the charts also indicate that some models manufactured by other than AMD may still require the bridge).\n\nThe Radeon R9 290 and R9 290X graphics cards (released on October 24, 2013 and based on Graphics Core Next 1.1 \"Volcanic Islands\") as well as GPUs using newer versions of GCN no longer have bridging ports. Instead, they use \"XDMA\" to open a direct channel of communication between the multiple GPUs in a system, operating over the same PCI Express bus which is used by AMD Radeon graphics cards.\n\nPCI Express 3.0 lanes provide up to 17.5 times higher bandwidth (15.754 GB/s for a ×16 slot) when compared to current external bridges (900 MB/s), rendering the use of a CrossFire bridge unnecessary. Thus, XDMA was selected for greater GPU interconnection bandwidth demands generated by AMD Eyefinity, and more recently by 4K resolution monitors. Bandwidth of the data channel opened by XDMA is fully dynamic, scaling itself together with the demands of the game being played, as well as adapting to advanced user settings such as vertical synchronization (vsync).\n\nAdditionally, some newer cards are capable of pairing with 7000-series cards based on the Graphics Core Next 1.0 \"Southern Islands\" architecture. For example, an R9-280X card can be used in a CrossFireX setup together with a HD 7970 card, largely due to them being the same product at different clock rates.\n\nGPUOpen offers some MIT-licensed source-code for DirectGMA stuff with multiple AMD GPUs in conjunction with Direct3D 11, OpenGL and OpenCL: https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/DirectGMA_P2P\n\nThere is also a \"hybrid\" mode of CrossFireX that combines on-board graphics using the AMD northbridge architecture with select graphic cards, for increased performance. The current generation is called Hybrid CrossFireX and is available for motherboards with integrated AMD chipsets in the 7 and 8 series GPUs, referred to as Hybrid CrossFireX.\n\nThis combination results in power-savings when simple or 2D graphics are used and performance increases of 25% to over 200% in 3D graphics over using a non CrossFire option. As of March 2012, it appears that this is now called \"AMD Radeon Dual Graphics\" and means using A-series Fusion APUs together with video cards.\n\nIn some cases CrossFire doesn't improve 3D performance – in some extreme cases, it can lower the framerate due to the particulars of an application's coding. This is also true for Nvidia's SLI, as the problem is inherent in multi-GPU systems. This is often witnessed when running an application at low resolutions.\n\nWhen using CrossFire with AFR, the subjective framerate can often be lower than the framerate reported by benchmarking applications, and may even be poorer than the frame rate of its single-GPU equivalent. This phenomenon is known as micro stuttering and also applies to SLI since it is inherent to multi-GPU configurations. AMD CrossFireX, and NVIDIA SLI setups both require bridges, and a power supply unit (PSU) capable of supplying enough power to the GPUs. 6 pin (75 watt 3+3, becoming rare now), 8 pin (150 watt 4+4), and 16 pin (300 watt 8+8) power plugs are all common in today's graphics cards.\n\nCrossFire can be implemented with GPU cards of the same generation, and manufacture (this is compared to Nvidia's SLI, which generally only works if all cards have the same GPU, and brand). This allows buyers who have varying budgets over time to purchase different cards and still get the benefits of increased performance. With the latest generation cards, they will only crossfire with other cards in their sub series. For example, GPU in the same series can be crossfired with each other. So a 5800 series GPU (e.g. a 5830) can run together with another 5800 series GPU (e.g. 5870). However, GPUs not in the same hundred series cannot be crossfired successfully (e.g. a 5770 cannot run with a 5870). The only exception is that the HD 7870 XT cards can be used with a HD 7900 series GPU (e.g., a 7950) in a crossfire configuration because they feature the same GPU.\n\nAMD CrossFire, and SLI configurations can run many monitors of varying size and resolutions. Both SLI , and CrossFire setups only allow up to four 8K (7680x4320) monitors, or eight 4K monitors (3840x2160). Each monitor requires its own dedicated graphics card (except for 4K, and standard HD), in that case up to two monitors can be on one dedicated graphics card.\n\nMajor downside of CrossFire is that it works only in fullscreen mode, requiring extrinsic support for software or games when run in borderless/windowed mode.\n\nThe first generation CrossFire implementations (the Radeon X800 to X1900 series) require an external y-cable/dongle to operate in CrossFire mode due to the PCI Express bus not being able to provide enough bandwidth to run CrossFire without losing a significant amount of performance.\n\n\n"}

A veteran Green Lantern, he has served in many Corps campaigns over the years. During the Crisis on Infinite Earths he protects multiple sectors, but found the experience depressing. After this, he went to Earth looking for company amongst his fellow Green Lanterns. He served with the contingent of Green Lanterns assigned to Earth and became good friends with Ch'p of H'lven. For a time Salaak lived in the future, filling the identity of Pol Manning as Hal Jordan had before him. While in the future, Salaak was married to a human woman.\n\nSalaak returns to the present day to warn about the destruction of the Corps. He was too late to stop the execution of Sinestro. The Central Power Battery on Oa ends up destroyed, and with it, Salaak's ring is made inoperable. He finds transport to H'lven where he reunites with Ch'p, one of the few Lanterns whose ring still functioned.

The Book tells of the adventures of multiple Green Lanterns throughout the history of the universe.\n\nSalaak reinforces the squadron of Lanterns sent to save Mogo from Ranx the Sentient City and other Sinestro Corps members (Sinestro having returned from the dead). He has expressed displeasure at the fact that the Guardians have rewritten the Book of Oa to allow lethal force against members of the Sinestro Corps, but is still committed to serve.\n\nHe survived the \"Sinestro Corps War\" without major injuries, and he continues to hold on to his position as keeper of the Book of Oa. He is kept out of the loop in some instances by the Guardians who neglected to tell him their plans to create the Alpha Lanterns. He is seen getting into an argument with Guy Gardner over a bar he wishes to open. Salaak quickly disapproves, which leads Guy to use his ring to make a miniaturized version of Salaak mocking him for \"hanging out with midgets\".\n\nSalaak is seen in \"Final Crisis\" #5 as part of the trial of Hal Jordan.\n\nDuring the \"Blackest Night\", Oa comes under siege from the Black Lantern Corps. With the Guardians missing, Salaak takes command of the Green Lantern Corps as Clarissi and thus the next in succession after the Guardians, preventing the Alpha Lanterns' attempt to take control. As his first command decision, Salaak decrees that all fallen Lantern rings be sent to Mogo, so as not to endanger any new recruits.\n\nAfter the \"War of the Green Lanterns\", Salaak went along with the Guardians' orders to prepare a space for Krona in the Green Lantern memorial hall despite the other Corps members' anger at such a decision, despite Salaak claiming that the Guardians want to remember the good that Krona did in helping to found the Corps rather than the evil he committed later, with the other Corps members denouncing him for his blind loyalty.\n\nWhen Kyle Rayner is briefly turned into a ring magnet, Salaak attempts to remove Kyle's Green Lantern ring on the Guardians' orders. Kyle's ring resists Salaak's attempt at removal as Kyle protests the decision and what they did to Ganthet. Later, Salaak assigns the Green Lantern B'dg to find Hal Jordan on Earth and discovers that the green rings are being delayed under the authorization of the Guardians to which he also secretly informs Kilowog of these events. Concerned at recent events, Salaak begins to spy on the Guardians, learning of their plans for the Third Army. He is subsequently caught and locked away despite his protests that their plans are wrong. After the unemotional Guardians are killed off by Sinestro, Salaak is freed from his imprisonment by Kilowog and Guy Gardner, who explain to him the events regarding the villainous First Lantern. Later, Salaak helps Guy search for his old arch-enemy, Xar. Guy slays Xar on Earth.\n\nAs with most Lanterns, Salakk is lost in the dying universe proceeding this one. He is fortunate to be one of the few Lanterns on the thriving, living Lantern world Mogo, which has become a center of activity in what is left of said universe.\n\nThe Corps have returned, damaged and with many casualties, to their proper place and time. Salakk has returned to active duty, such as assisting against the brainwashing menace Starro.\n\n\n\nSalaak makes a cameo appearance in the live-action \"Green Lantern\" film.\n\n\nSalaak is featured in the \"Smallville Season 11\" digital comic based on the TV series.\n\n"}

His music uses a combination of conventional instruments and new, unusual, and structurally modified instruments. Partly due to his studies of non-Western music, much of Denyer's music is microtonal.\n\nDenyer was a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral and later studied at the Guildhall in London. In 1966 he co-founded, and was director of, the Society of Hermes, an arts club for new music, painting, poetry and theatre in Shepherds Bush, London. He formed and directed Mouth of Hermes. a professional instrumental ensemble devoted to new and experimental forms of music. He toured widely with the ensemble in Europe, Scandinavia and the U.K. in the years up to 1974, presenting new compositions. During this time he was Lecturer in Composition and 20th Century Studies at Hornsey College of Art. This early period culminated in his being a featured composer/performer at the Festival d’Orleans, France, in 1973.\n\nDenyer left the UK for a time in 1974 to begin what he calls his \"musical travels\", and to undertake his first attempts at ethnomusicological fieldwork (in west Asia and the Kulu Valley in north India). In the summer of 1974 he was a Visiting lecturer at the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, India. Between 1974 and 1977 he was a PhD student in Ethnomusicology at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. Thereafter he was Research Fellow in African Music at the Institute of African Studies, University of Nairobi, Kenya, and then Lecturer in Ethnomusicology at Kenyatta University College in Nairobi. The impact of these studies on his subsequent musical output is profound, but Denyer has never been interested in hybridization or \"crossover\". Upon his return to England in 1981 he began teaching at Dartington College of Arts in Devon, where he was a Professor of Composition until the college merged with University College Falmouth in 2010. Together with James Fulkerson co-founded the Barton Workshop in Amsterdam in 1990 to perform American experimental music and his own compositions; his recordings of the solo piano music and ensemble works of Morton Feldman, Galina Ustvolskaya, Christian Wolff, John Cage, Jerry Hunt, James Tenney, Alvin Lucier and others have met with wide acclaim.\n\nDenyer's music has remained resolutely independent of musical fashion. An early interest in melody in the 1970s has remained a feature of his work (as seen perhaps in its most extreme form in his works for shakuhachi, collected on the 2007 CD \"Music for shakuhachi\" [see Discography]). His music shows an extraordinary ear for timbre, and for novel combinations of acoustic sounds. The first of his large-scale works, \"A Monkey's Paw\" (premiered at Darmstadt in 1990; see Discography) displays this clearly. More recently an interest in extremely quiet sounds has characterised several works, including \"Prison Song\", \"Faint Traces\" and \"Tentative Thoughts, Silenced Voices\" (collectively forming his \"Prison Trilogy\" (1999–2003)).\n\nThough not a shakuhachi player himself, Denyer has collaborated with Yoshikazu Iwamoto to write pieces for the instrument, including:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1967935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967935", "title": "Mark Felt", "text": "Mark Felt\n\nWilliam Mark Felt Sr. (August 17, 1913 – December 18, 2008) was an American law enforcement officer who worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from 1942 to 1973 and was known for his role in the Watergate scandal. Felt was an FBI special agent who eventually rose to the position of Associate Director, the Bureau's second-highest-ranking post. Felt worked in several FBI field offices prior to his promotion to the Bureau's headquarters. In 1980 he was convicted of having violated the civil rights of people thought to be associated with members of the Weather Underground, by ordering FBI agents to break into their homes and search the premises as part of an attempt to prevent bombings. He was ordered to pay a fine, but was pardoned by President Ronald Reagan during his appeal.\n\nIn 2005, at age 91, Felt revealed that during his tenure as associate director of the FBI he had been the notorious anonymous source known as \"Deep Throat\" who provided \"The Washington Post\" reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with critical information about the Watergate scandal, which ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974. Though Felt's identity as Deep Throat was suspected, including by Nixon himself, it had generally remained a secret for 30 years. Felt finally acknowledged that he was Deep Throat after being persuaded by his daughter to reveal his identity before his death.\n\nFelt published two memoirs: \"The FBI Pyramid\" in 1979 (updated in 2006), and \"A G-Man's Life\", written with John O'Connor, in 2006. In 2012 the FBI released Felt's personnel file, covering the period from 1941 to 1978. It also released files pertaining to an extortion threat made against Felt in 1956.\n\nBorn on August 17, 1913, in Twin Falls, Idaho, Felt was the son of Rose R. Dygert and Mark Earl Felt, a carpenter and building contractor. His paternal grandfather was a Free Will Baptist minister. His maternal grandparents were born in Canada and Scotland. Through his maternal grandfather, Felt was descended from Revolutionary War general Nicholas Herkimer of New York.\n\nAfter graduating from Twin Falls High School in 1931, Felt attended the University of Idaho in Moscow. He was a member and president of the Gamma Gamma chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1935.\n\nFelt then went to Washington, D.C., to work in the office of Democratic U.S. Senator James P. Pope. In 1938, Felt married Audrey Robinson of Gooding, Idaho, whom he had known when they were students at the University of Idaho. She had come to Washington to work at the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Their wedding was officiated by the chaplain of the United States House of Representatives, the Rev. Sheara Montgomery. Audrey died in 1984; she and Felt had two children, Joan and Mark.\n\nFelt stayed on with Pope's successor in the Senate, David Worth Clark (D-Idaho). He attended the George Washington University Law School at night, earning his law degree in 1940, and was admitted to the District of Columbia Bar in 1941.\n\nUpon graduation, Felt took a position at the Federal Trade Commission but did not enjoy his work. His workload was very light, and he was assigned to investigate whether a toilet paper brand, called \"Red Cross\", was misleading consumers into thinking it was endorsed by the American Red Cross. Felt wrote in his memoir:\nMy research, which required days of travel and hundreds of interviews, produced two definite conclusions:\n\n1. Most people \"did\" use toilet tissue.\n\n2. Most people \"did not\" appreciate being asked about it.\n\nThat was when I started looking for other employment.\n\nHe applied for a job with the FBI in November 1941 and was accepted. His first day at the Bureau was January 26, 1942.\n\nFBI Director J. Edgar Hoover often moved Bureau agents around so they would have wide experience in the field. This was typical of other agencies and corporations of the time. Felt observed that Hoover \"wanted every agent to get into any field office at any time. Since he [Hoover] had never been transferred and did not have a family, he had no idea of the financial and personal hardship involved.\"\n\nAfter completing 16 weeks of training at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and FBI Headquarters in Washington, Felt was assigned to Texas, spending three months each in the field offices in Houston and San Antonio. He returned to FBI Headquarters, where he was assigned to the Espionage Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division, tracking down spies and saboteurs during World War II. He worked on the Major Case Desk. His most notable work was on the \"Peasant\" case. Helmut Goldschmidt, operating under the codename \"Peasant\", was a German agent in custody in England. Under Felt's direction, his German masters were led to believe that \"Peasant\" had made his way to the United States, and thus were fed disinformation on Allied plans.\n\nThe Espionage Section was abolished in May 1945 after V-E Day. After the war, Felt was assigned to the Seattle field office. After two years of general work, he spent two years as a firearms instructor and was promoted from agent to supervisor. Upon passage of the Atomic Energy Act and the creation of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the Seattle office became responsible for completing background checks of workers at the Hanford plutonium plant near Richland, Washington. Felt oversaw those investigations. In 1954 Felt returned briefly to Washington as an inspector's aide. Two months later, he was sent to New Orleans as Assistant Special Agent-in-Charge of the field office. When he was transferred to Los Angeles fifteen months later, he held the same rank there.\n\nIn 1956, Felt was transferred to Salt Lake City and promoted to Special Agent-in-Charge. The Salt Lake City office included Nevada within its purview, and Felt oversaw some of the Bureau's earliest investigations into organized crime, assessing the mob's operations in the Reno and Las Vegas casinos. (It was Hoover's, and therefore the Bureau's, official position at the time that there was no such thing as the Mob.) In February 1958, Felt was assigned to Kansas City, Missouri (which he dubbed \"the Siberia of field offices\" in his memoir), where he directed further investigations of organized crime. By this time, Hoover had come to believe in organized crime, in the wake of the famous Apalachin, New York, conclave of underworld bosses in November 1957.\n\nFelt returned to Washington, D.C., in September 1962. As assistant to the bureau's assistant director in charge of the Training Division, Felt helped oversee the FBI Academy. In November 1964, he was promoted to an Assistant Director of the Bureau, as Chief Inspector of the Bureau and Head of the Inspection Division. This division oversaw compliance with Bureau regulations and conducted internal investigations.\n\nOn July 1, 1971, Felt was promoted by Hoover to Deputy Associate Director, assisting Associate Director Clyde Tolson. Hoover's right-hand man for decades, Tolson was in failing health and unable to carry out his duties. Richard Gid Powers wrote that Hoover installed Felt to rein in William C. Sullivan's domestic spying operations, as Sullivan had been engaged in secret unofficial work for the White House. In his memoir, Felt quoted Hoover as having said, \"I need someone who can control Sullivan. I think you know he has been getting out of hand.\" In his book, \"The Bureau\", Ronald Kessler said that Felt \"managed to please Hoover by being tactful with him and tough on agents\". Curt Gentry described Felt as \"the director's latest fair-haired boy\", who had \"no inherent power\" in his new post, the real number three being John P. Mohr.\n\nAmong the criminal groups that the FBI investigated in the early 1970s was the Weather Underground. Their case was dismissed by the court because it concluded that the FBI had conducted illegal activities, including unauthorized wiretaps, break-ins, and mail interceptions. The lead federal prosecutor on the case, William C. Ibershof, claims that Felt and Attorney General John Mitchell initiated these illegal activities that tainted the investigation.\n\nHoover died in his sleep and was found on the morning of May 2, 1972. Tolson was nominally in charge until the next day, when Nixon appointed L. Patrick Gray III as Acting FBI Director. Tolson submitted his resignation, which Gray accepted. Felt succeeded to Tolson's post as Associate Director, the number-two job in the Bureau. Felt served as an honorary pallbearer at Hoover's funeral.\nOn the day of Hoover's death, Hoover's secretary for five decades, Helen Gandy, began destroying his files. She turned over twelve boxes of the \"Official/Confidential\" files to Felt on May 4, 1972. These contained 167 files and 17,750 pages, many of them containing derogatory information about individuals whom Hoover had investigated. He used this information as power over them. Felt stored the files in his office.\n\nThe existence of such files had long been rumored. Gray told the press that afternoon that \"there are no dossiers or secret files. There are just general files and I took steps to preserve their integrity.\" Felt earlier that day had told Gray, \"Mr. Gray, the Bureau doesn't have any secret files\", and later accompanied Gray to Hoover's office. They found Gandy boxing up papers. Felt said Gray \"looked casually at an open file drawer and approved her work\", though Gray would later deny he looked at anything. Gandy retained Hoover's \"Personal File\" and destroyed it.\n\nWhen Felt was called to testify in 1975 by the U.S. House about the destruction of Hoover's papers, he said, \"There's no serious problems if we lose some papers. I don't see anything wrong and I still don't.\" At the same hearing, Gandy claimed that she had destroyed Hoover's personal files only after receiving Gray's approval. In a letter submitted to the committee in rebuttal of Gandy's testimony, Gray vehemently denied ever giving such permission. Both Gandy's testimony and Gray's letter were included in the committee's final report.\n\nIn his memoir, Felt expressed mixed feelings about Gray. He was the first person appointed as head of the FBI who had no experience in the agency, but he had experience in the Navy. While noting Gray did work hard, Felt was critical of how often he was away from FBI headquarters. Gray lived in Stonington, Connecticut, and commuted to Washington. He also visited all of the Bureau's field offices except Honolulu. His frequent absences led to the nickname \"Three-Day Gray\". These absences, combined with Gray's hospitalization and recuperation from November 20, 1972, to January 2, 1973, meant that Felt was effectively in charge for much of his final year at the Bureau. Bob Woodward wrote \"Gray got to be director of the FBI and Felt did the work.\" Felt wrote in his memoir:\n\nThe record amply demonstrates that President Nixon made Pat Gray the Acting Director of the FBI because he wanted a politician in J. Edgar Hoover's position who would convert the Bureau into an adjunct of the White House machine.\n\nGray's defenders would later argue that Gray had practiced a management style that was different from that of Hoover. Gray's program of field office visits was something that Hoover had not done since his early years as director; some believed that Gray's visits helped raise the morale of the field agents. Gray's leadership style seemed to continue what he had learned in the US Navy, in which the executive officer concentrates on the basic operation of the ship, while the captain concentrates on its position and heading. Felt believed Gray's methods were an unnecessary distraction from the work of the FBI and showed a lack of leadership. He believed that he was not the only career manager at the FBI who disapproved of Gray's methods, particularly among those who had served under Hoover.\n\nAs Associate Director, Felt saw everything compiled on Watergate before it was given to Gray. The Agent in Charge, Charles Nuzum, sent his findings to Investigative Division Head Robert Gebhardt, who passed the information on to Felt. From the day of the break-in, June 17, 1972, until the FBI investigation was mostly completed in June 1973, Felt was the key control point for FBI information. He had been among the first to learn of the investigation, being informed the morning of June 17. Ronald Kessler, who spoke to former Bureau agents, reported that throughout the investigation, they \"were amazed to see material in Woodward and Bernstein's stories lifted almost verbatim from their reports of interviews a few days or weeks earlier\".\n\nBob Woodward first describes his source, nicknamed \"Deep Throat\", in \"All the President's Men\", as a \"source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP (the Committee to Re-elect the President, Nixon's 1972 campaign organization), as well as at the White House\". In the book, Deep Throat is described as an \"incurable gossip\" who was \"in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch\", a man \"whose fight had been worn out in too many battles\". Woodward had known the source before Watergate and had discussed politics and government with him.\n\nIn 2005 Woodward wrote that he first met Felt at the White House in 1969 or 1970. Woodward was working as an aide to Admiral Thomas Hinman Moorer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was delivering papers to the White House Situation Room. In his book \"The Secret Man\", Woodward described Felt as a \"tall man with perfectly combed gray hair ... distinguished looking\" with a \"studied air of confidence, even what might be called a command presence\". They stayed in touch and spoke on the telephone several times. When Woodward started working at the \"Washington Post\", he phoned Felt on several occasions to ask for information for articles in the paper. Felt's information, taken on a promise that Woodward would never reveal its origin, was a source for a few stories, notably for an article on May 18, 1972, about Arthur Bremer, who shot George Wallace.\n\nWhen the Watergate story broke, Woodward called on Felt. Felt told Woodward on June 19 that E. Howard Hunt, who had ties to Nixon, was involved: the telephone number of his White House office had been listed in the address book of one of the burglars. Initially, Woodward's source was known at the \"Post\" as \"My Friend\". \"Post\" editor Howard Simons tagged him as \"Deep Throat\", after the widely known porno film \"Deep Throat\". According to Woodward, Simons thought of the term because Felt had been providing information on a deep background basis.\n\nWhen Felt revealed his role in 2005, it was noted that \"My Friend\" has the same initial letters as \"Mark Felt\". Woodward's notes from interviewing Felt were marked \"M.F.\", which Woodward says was \"not very good tradecraft\".\n\nWoodward explained that when he wanted to meet Deep Throat, he would move a flowerpot with a red flag on his apartment balcony; he lived at number 617, Webster House, 1718 P Street, Northwest. On occasions when Deep Throat wanted a meeting, he would circle the page number on page twenty of Woodward's copy of \"The New York Times\" (delivered to his building) and draw clock hands to signal the hour.\n\nAdrian Havill questioned these claims in his 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein. He said Woodward's balcony faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street. Woodward said that the courtyard had been bricked in since he lived there. Havill also said \"The Times\" was not delivered in copies marked by apartment, but Woodward and a former neighbor disputed this claim.\n\nWoodward said:\n\nDays after the break-in, Nixon and White House chief of staff H. R. Haldeman talked about putting pressure on the FBI to slow down the investigation. The District of Columbia police had called in the FBI because they found the burglars had wiretapping equipment. Wiretapping is a crime investigated by the FBI. Haldeman told President Nixon on June 23, 1972, that Felt would \"want to cooperate because he's ambitious\". These tapes were not declassified and revealed for some time.\n\nHaldeman later initially suspected lower-level FBI agents, including Angelo Lano, of speaking to the \"Post\". But in a taped conversation on October 19, 1972, Haldeman told the president that sources had said that Felt was speaking to the press.\n\nYou can't say anything about this because it will screw up our source and there's a real concern. Mitchell is the only one who knows about this and he feels strongly that we better not do anything because ... if we move on him, he'll go out and unload everything. He knows everything that's to be known in the FBI. He has access to absolutely everything.\n\nHaldeman also said that he had spoken to White House counsel John W. Dean about punishing Felt, but Dean said Felt had committed no crime and could not be prosecuted.\n\nWhen Acting FBI Director Gray returned from his sick leave in January 1973, he confronted Felt about being the source for Woodward and Bernstein. Gray said he had defended Felt to Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst: \"You know, Mark, Dick Kleindienst told me I ought to get rid of you. He says White House staff members are concerned that you are the FBI source of leaks to Woodward and Bernstein\". Felt replied, \"Pat, I haven't leaked anything to anybody.\" Gray told Felt:\n\nI told Kleindienst that you've worked with me in a very competent manner and I'm convinced that you are completely loyal. I told him I was not going to move you out. Kleindienst told me, \"Pat, I love you for that.\"\n\nOn February 17, 1973, Nixon nominated Gray as Hoover's permanent replacement as Director. Until then, Gray had been in limbo as Acting Director. In another taped conversation on February 28, Nixon spoke to Dean about Felt's acting as an informant, and mentioned that he had never met him. Gray was forced to resign on April 27, after it was revealed that he had destroyed a file that had been in the White House safe of E. Howard Hunt. Gray recommended Felt as his successor.\n\nThe day Gray resigned, Kleindienst spoke to Nixon, urging him to appoint Felt as head of the FBI. Nixon instead appointed William Ruckelshaus as Acting Director. Stanley Kutler reported that Nixon said, \"I don't want him. I can't have him. I just talked to Bill Ruckelshaus and Bill is a Mr. Clean and I want a fellow in there that is not part of the old guard and that is not part of that infighting in there.\" On another White House tape, from May 11, 1973, Nixon and White House Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig, spoke of Felt leaking material to \"The New York Times\". Nixon said, \"he's a bad guy, you see.\" He said that William Sullivan had told him of Felt's ambition to be Director of the Bureau.\n\nFelt called his relationship with Ruckelshaus \"stormy\". In his memoir, Felt describes Ruckelshaus as a \"security guard sent to see that the FBI did nothing which would displease Mr. Nixon\".\n\nIn mid-1973 \"The New York Times\" published a series of articles about wiretaps that had been ordered by Hoover during his tenure at the FBI. Ruckelshaus believed that the information must have come from someone at the FBI.\n\nIn June 1973 Ruckelshaus received a call from someone claiming to be a \"New York Times\" reporter, telling him that Felt was the source of this information. On June 21, Ruckelshaus met privately with Felt and accused him of leaking information to \"The New York Times\", a charge that Felt adamantly denied. Ruckelshaus told Felt to \"sleep on it\" and let him know the next day what he wanted to do. Felt resigned from the Bureau the next day, June 22, 1973, ending his thirty-one year career.\n\nIn a 2013 interview, Ruckelshaus noted the possibility that the original caller was a hoax. He said that he considered Felt's resignation \"an admission of guilt\" anyway.\n\nRuckelshaus, who had served only as Acting Director, was replaced several weeks later by Clarence M. Kelley, who had been nominated by Nixon as FBI Director and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nIn the early 1970s Felt had supervised Operation COINTELPRO, initiated by Hoover in the 1950s. This period of FBI history has generated great controversy for its abuses of private citizens' rights. The FBI was spying on, infiltrating, and disrupting the Civil Rights Movement, Anti-War Movement, Black Panthers, and other New Left groups. By 1972 Felt was heading the investigation into the Weather Underground, which had planted bombs at the Capitol, the Pentagon, and the State Department building. Felt, along with Edward S. Miller, authorized FBI agents to break into homes secretly in 1972 and 1973, without a search warrant, on nine separate occasions. These kinds of FBI operations were known as \"black bag jobs\". The break-ins occurred at five addresses in New York and New Jersey, at the homes of relatives and acquaintances of Weather Underground members. They did not contribute to the capture of any fugitives. The use of \"black bag jobs\" by the FBI was declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in the \"Plamondon\" case, 407 U.S. 297 (1972).\n\nThe Church Committee of Congress revealed the FBI's illegal activities, and many agents were investigated. In 1976 Felt publicly stated he had ordered break-ins, and recommended against punishment of individual agents who had carried out orders. Felt also stated that Patrick Gray had also authorized the break-ins, but Gray denied this. Felt said on the CBS television program \"Face the Nation\" he would probably be a \"scapegoat\" for the Bureau's work. \"I think this is justified and I'd do it again tomorrow,\" he said on the program. While admitting the break-ins were \"extralegal\", he justified them as protecting the \"greater good\". Felt said:\n\nTo not take action against these people and know of a bombing in advance would simply be to stick your fingers in your ears and protect your eardrums when the explosion went off and then start the investigation.\n\nGriffin B. Bell, the Attorney General in the Jimmy Carter administration, directed investigation of these cases. On April 10, 1978, a federal grand jury charged Felt, Miller, and Gray with conspiracy to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by searching their homes without warrants.\n\nThe indictment charged violations of Title 18, Section 241 of the United States Code and stated Felt and the others:\n\nDid unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with each other to injure and oppress citizens of the United States who were relatives and acquaintances of the Weatherman fugitives, in the free exercise and enjoyments of certain rights and privileges secured to them by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America.\n\nFelt told his biographer Ronald Kessler: I was shocked that I was indicted. You would be too, if you did what you thought was in the best interests of the country and someone on technical grounds indicted you.\n\nFelt, Gray, and Miller were arraigned in Washington, DC on April 20. Seven hundred current and former FBI agents were outside the courthouse applauding the \"Washington Three\", as Felt referred to himself and his colleagues in his memoir. Gray's case did not go to trial and was dropped by the government for lack of evidence on December 11, 1980.\n\nFelt and Miller attempted to plea bargain with the government, willing to agree to a misdemeanor guilty plea to conducting searches without warrants—a violation of . The government rejected the offer in 1979. After eight postponements, the case against Felt and Miller went to trial in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 18, 1980. On October 29, former President Richard M. Nixon appeared as a rebuttal witness for the defense. He testified that in authorizing the Bureau to conduct break-ins to gather foreign intelligence information \"he was acting on precedents established by a number of Presidential directives dating to 1939.\" It was Nixon's first courtroom appearance since his resignation in 1974. Nixon also contributed money to Felt's defense fund, since Felt's legal expenses were running over $600,000 by then. Also testifying were former Attorneys General Mitchell, Kleindienst, Herbert Brownell Jr., Nicholas Katzenbach, and Ramsey Clark, all of whom said warrantless searches in national security matters were commonplace and understood not to be illegal. Mitchell and Kleindienst denied they had authorized any of the break-ins at issue in the trial. (The Bureau used a national security justification for the searches because it alleged the Weather Underground was in the employ of Cuba.)\n\nThe jury returned guilty verdicts on November 6, 1980, two days after the presidential election. The charge carried a maximum sentence of ten years in prison and a $10,000 fine; on December 15, Judge William Bryant fined Felt $5,000 and Miller $3,500, but imposed no jail time for either. Writing an OpEd piece in \"The New York Times\" a week after the conviction, attorney Roy Cohn claimed that Felt and Miller were being used as scapegoats by the Carter administration and it was an unfair prosecution. Cohn wrote the break-ins were the \"final dirty trick\" of the Nixon administration, and there had been no \"personal motive\" to their actions. \"The New York Times\" praised the convictions, saying \"the case has established that zeal is no excuse for violating the Constitution.\"\n\nFelt and Miller appealed their verdicts.\n\nIn a phone call on January 30, 1981, Edwin Meese encouraged President Ronald Reagan to issue a pardon. After further encouragement from Felt's former colleagues, President Reagan pardoned Felt and Miller. The pardon was signed on March 26, but due to the assassination attempt on March 30, was not announced to the public until April 15, 1981.\n\nIn the pardon, Reagan wrote:\n\nNixon sent Felt and Miller bottles of champagne with the note \"Justice ultimately prevails.\" \"The New York Times\" disapproved in an editorial, saying that the United States \"deserved better than a gratuitous revision of the record by the President\". Felt and Miller said they would seek repayment of their legal fees from the government.\n\nThe prosecutor at the trial, John W. Nields Jr., said, \"I would warrant that whoever is responsible for the pardons did not read the record of the trial and did not know the facts of the case.\" Nields also complained that the White House did not consult with the prosecutors in the case, which was contrary to the usual practice when a pardon was under consideration.\n\nFelt said,\n\nI feel very excited and just so pleased that I can hardly contain myself. I am most grateful to the President. I don't know how I'm ever going to be able to thank him. It's just like having a heavy burden lifted off your back. This case has been dragging on for five years.\n\nAt a press conference the day of the announcement, Miller said, \"I certainly owe the Gipper one.\" Carter Attorney General Griffin Bell said he did not object to the pardons, as the convictions had upheld constitutional principles.\n\nDespite their pardons, Felt and Miller won permission from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to appeal their convictions so as to remove it from their record and to prevent it from being used in civil suits by victims of the break-ins they had ordered. Ultimately, the court restored Felt's law license in 1982, based on Reagan's pardon. In June 1982, Felt and Miller testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee's security and terrorism subcommittee. They said that the restrictions placed on the FBI by Attorney General Edward H. Levi were threatening the country's safety.\n\nHis daughter Joan graduated from high school in Kansas City during his assignment there and attended the University of Kansas for two years before transferring to Stanford in California to study drama. When she was an undergraduate, Felt finally settled in Alexandria, Virginia, when he took his post at the FBI Academy.\n\nPrior to the Watergate scandal, Felt had become estranged from Joan. They had been close during her childhood, but after she graduated from Stanford, she had gone to Chile under a Fulbright scholarship to continue her studies. While there, she became friends with Marxist revolutionary Andrés Pascal Allende, nephew of future president Salvador Allende. When she returned home, her political views had shifted to the extreme left, putting her in conflict with her conservative father.\n\nShe earned her master's degree in Spanish at Stanford, and then joined a hippie community in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Felt and his wife went to visit her once and were appalled at her counterculture lifestyle and use of drugs; he was reminded of members of the militant Weather Underground that the FBI had been prosecuting. Joan's friends were equally shocked that her father was an FBI agent. Following their visit, Joan cut off most contact with her parents. As a result, and combined with the fact that she did not follow the news, she was unaware of her father's legal problems that arose from the Watergate scandal.\n\nOver the years, the stress of following her husband's career as well as from the separation from her daughter, combined with Felt's prosecution had taken their toll on Audrey. During Felt's time in Seattle in 1954, Audrey suffered a nervous breakdown. She developed a dependency on alcohol and had been taking antidepressants for years. She had also been hospitalized several times for various ailments. When Felt was put on trial in 1980, she attended the first day, but did not return because she was unable to bear it. In 1984 she committed suicide using Felt's revolver. Felt and his son Mark Jr., an officer in the United States Air Force, decided to keep this a secret and told Joan that her mother had died of a heart attack. Joan did not learn the truth about her mother until 2001.\n\nMeanwhile, Joan had become an adherent of Adi Da, who had founded a new religious movement in San Francisco called Adidam, and she was living in Santa Rosa. She had borne three sonsLudi (later Will), Rob, and Nick, the latter two from another Adidam devotee whom she never marriedbut her parents had only met Ludi during their visit in 1974. After Audrey's death, Felt began making yearly visits to see Joan and his grandsons, and they also came to visit him and his new girlfriend, who lived in the same apartment complex.\n\nIn 1990 Felt permanently moved to Santa Rosa, leaving behind his entire life in Alexandria. He bought a house where he lived with Joan, and took care of the boys while she worked, teaching at Sonoma State University and Santa Rosa Junior College. He suffered a stroke before 1999, as reported by Kessler in his book \"The Bureau.\" According to Kessler's book, in the summer of 1999, Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the Santa Rosa home and took Felt to lunch.\n\nJoan, who was caring for her father, told Kessler that her father had greeted Woodward like an old friend. Their meeting appeared to be more of a celebration than an interview. \"Woodward just showed up at the door and said he was in the area,\" Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler's book, which was published in 2002. \"He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away. He walked to the house. He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine.\"\n\nFelt published his memoir \"The FBI Pyramid: From the Inside\" in 1979. It was co-written with Hoover biographer Ralph de Toledano, though the latter's name appears only in the copyright notice. Toledano in 2005 wrote that the volume was \"largely written by me since his original manuscript read like \"The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table\"\". Toledano said: Felt swore to me that he was not Deep Throat, and that he had never leaked information to the Woodward-Bernstein team or anyone else. The book was published and bombed.\n\nIn his memoir, Felt strongly defended Hoover and his tenure as Director; he condemned the criticisms of the Bureau made in the 1970s by the Church Committee and civil libertarians. He also denounced the treatment of Bureau agents as criminals and said the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act of 1974 served only to interfere with government work and helped criminals. (He opens the book with the sentence, \"The Bill of Rights is not a suicide pact\", Justice Robert H. Jackson's comment in his dissent to \"Terminiello v. City of Chicago\", 337 U.S. 1 (1949)).\n\n\"Library Journal\" wrote in its review that \"at one time Felt was assumed to be Watergate's 'Deep Throat'; in this interesting but hardly sensational memoir, he makes it clear that that honor, if honor it be, lies elsewhere.\" \"The New York Times Book Review\" was highly critical of the book, saying Felt \"seeks to perpetuate a view of Hoover and the FBI that is no longer seriously peddled even on the backs of cereal boxes\". It said the book contained \"a disturbing number of factual errors\". Curt Gentry said that Felt was \"the keeper of the Hoover flame\".\n\nKessler said in his book that the measures Woodward took to conceal his meeting with Felt lent \"credence\" to the notion that Felt was Deep Throat. Woodward confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat in 2005. \"There are plenty of people claiming they knew Deep Throat was actually former FBI man Mark Felt ... On May 3, 2002, PAGE SIX reported that Ronald Kessler, author of \"The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI\", says that all the evidence points to former top FBI official W. Mark Felt.\"\n\nThe identity of Deep Throat was debated for more than three decades, and Felt was frequently mentioned as a possibility. An October 1990 \"Washingtonian\" magazine article about \"Washington secrets\" listed the 15 most prominent Deep Throat candidates, including Felt.\n\nJack Limpert published evidence as early as 1974 that Felt was the informant. On June 25 of that year, a few weeks after \"All the President's Men\" was published, \"The Wall Street Journal\" ran an editorial, \"If You Drink Scotch, Smoke, Read, Maybe You're Deep Throat.\" It began \"W. Mark Felt says he isn't now, nor has he ever been Deep Throat.\" The \"Journal\" quoted Felt saying the character was a \"composite\" and \"I'm just not that kind of person.\" In 1975 George V. Higgins wrote: \"Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a \"Washington Post\" alias borrowed from a dirty movie.\" During a grand jury investigation in 1976, Felt was called to testify. The prosecutor, J. Stanley Pottinger, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, discovered that Felt was \"Deep Throat\", but the secrecy of the proceedings protected the information from being public.\n\nIn 1992 James Mann, who had been a reporter at \"The Washington Post\" in 1972 and worked with Woodward, wrote a piece for \"The Atlantic Monthly\", saying the source had to have been within the FBI. He noted Felt as a possibility, but said he could not confirm this.\n\nAlexander P. Butterfield, the White House aide best known for revealing Nixon's taping system, told the \"Hartford Courant\" in 1995, \"I think it was a guy named Mark Felt.\" In July 1999, Felt was identified as Deep Throat by the \"Hartford Courant\", citing Chase Culeman-Beckman, a nineteen-year-old from Port Chester, New York. Culeman-Beckman said Jacob Bernstein, the son of Carl Bernstein and Nora Ephron, had told him the name at summer camp in 1988, and that Jacob claimed he had been told by his father. Felt said to the \"Courant\", \"No, it's not me. I would have done better. I would have been more effective. Deep Throat didn't exactly bring the White House crashing down, did he?\" Bernstein said his son didn't know. \"Bob and I have been wise enough never to tell our wives, and we've certainly never told our children.\" (Bernstein reiterated on June 2, 2005, on the \"Today Show\" that his wife had never known.)\n\nLeonard Garment, President Nixon's former law partner who became White House counsel after John W. Dean's resignation, ruled Felt out as Deep Throat in his 2000 book \"In Search of Deep Throat\". Garment wrote:\n\nThe Felt theory was a strong one ... Felt had a personal motive for acting. After the death of J. Edgar Hoover ... Felt thought he was a leading candidate to succeed Hoover ... The characteristics were a good fit. The trouble with Felt's candidacy was that Deep Throat in \"All the President's Men\" simply did not sound to me like a career FBI man.\n\nGarment said the information leaked to Woodward was inside White House information to which Felt would not have had access. \"Felt did not fit.\" (Once the secret was revealed, it was noted Felt did have access to such information because the Bureau's agents were interviewing high-ranking White House officials.)\n\nIn 2002 the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" profiled Felt. Noting his denial in \"The FBI Pyramid\", the paper wrote:\n\nCuriously, his son—American Airlines pilot Mark Felt—now says that shouldn't be read as a definitive denial, and that he plans to answer the question once-and-for-all in a second memoir. The excerpt of the working draft obtained by the \"Chronicle\" has Felt still denying he's Throat but providing a rationale for why Throat did the right thing.\n\nIn February 2005 reports surfaced that Woodward had prepared Deep Throat's obituary because he was near death. Chief Justice William Rehnquist was battling cancer at the time (he would die in September 2005), and there was speculation that Rehnquist might have been Deep Throat. Rehnquist was Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel, from 1969 to 1971, and then served on the Supreme Court until his death in 2005.\n\n\"Vanity Fair\" magazine revealed that Felt was Deep Throat on May 31, 2005, when it published an article (eventually appearing in the July issue of the magazine) on its website by John D. O'Connor, an attorney acting on Felt's behalf. Felt said, \"I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat.\" After the \"Vanity Fair\" story broke, Benjamin C. Bradlee, the editor of the \"Washington Post\" during Watergate, confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat. According to the \"Vanity Fair\" article, Felt was persuaded to come out by his family. They hoped to capitalize on the book deals and other lucrative opportunities which Felt would be offered in order to help pay for his grandchildren's education. His family was unaware that he was Deep Throat for many years. Although Felt was suffering from dementia and had previously denied he was Deep Throat, both Woodward and Bernstein confirmed the attorney’s claim. Felt's family realized the truth after his retirement, when they became aware of his close friendship with Bob Woodward.\n\nNixon's Chief Counsel Charles Colson, who served prison time for his actions in the Nixon White House, said Felt had violated \"his oath to keep this nation's secrets\". A \"Los Angeles Times\" editorial argued that this argument was specious, \"as if there's no difference between nuclear strategy and rounding up hush money to silence your hired burglars\". Ralph de Toledano, who co-wrote Felt's 1979 memoir, said Mark Felt Jr. had approached him in 2004 to buy Toledano's half of the copyright. Toledano agreed to sell but was never paid. He attempted to rescind the deal, threatening legal action. A few days before the \"Vanity Fair\" article was released, Toledano finally received a check.\n\nHe later said: \"I had been gloriously and illegally deceived, and Deep Throat was, in characteristic style, back in business—which given his history of betrayal, was par for the course.\"\n\nAfter the revelation, publishers were interested in signing Felt to a book deal. Weeks later, PublicAffairs Books announced that it signed a deal with Felt. Its CEO was a \"Washington Post\" reporter and editor during the Watergate era. The new book was to include material from Felt's 1979 memoir, plus an update. The new volume was scheduled for publication in early 2006. Felt sold the movie rights to his story to Universal Pictures for development by Tom Hanks's production company, Playtone. The book and movie deals were valued at US$1 million. A film based on those rights, \"\", in which Felt is portrayed by Liam Neeson, was released in 2017.\n\nIn mid-2005 Woodward published an account of his contacts with Felt, \"The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat\" ().\n\nPublic response to Felt and his actions has varied widely since these revelations. In the immediate aftermath, Felt's family called him an \"American hero\", suggesting that he leaked information for moral or patriotic reasons. G. Gordon Liddy, who was convicted of burglary in the Watergate scandal, said Felt should have gone to the grand jury rather than leak.\n\nSpeculation about Felt's motives for leaking has also varied widely. Some suggested that it was revenge for Nixon's choosing Gray over Felt to replace Hoover as FBI Director. Others suggest Felt acted out of institutional loyalty to the FBI.\n\nPolitical scientist George Friedman argued:\n\nThe \"Washington Post\" created a morality play about an out-of-control government brought to heel by two young, enterprising journalists and a courageous newspaper. That simply wasn't what happened. Instead, it was about the FBI using \"The Washington Post\" to leak information to destroy the president, and \"The Washington Post\" willingly serving as the conduit for that information while withholding an essential dimension of the story by concealing Deep Throat's identity.\n\nIn his 2012 book \"Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat\", Max Holland argued that Felt leaked the information in an attempt to become head of the FBI. Holland said that Felt wanted to create the perception that Gray \"could not control the FBI\". This could result in Nixon's firing Gray, leaving Felt as the obvious choice to run the agency. Holland said this plan (if it was one) backfired as Nixon and his team found out that Felt was the leaker.\n\nFelt died at home, in his sleep, on December 18, 2008. He was 95 years old and his death was attributed to heart failure.\n\n\n"}

He was a patriot leader during the American Revolution and represented New York in the Continental Congress.\n\nWisner was born around 1720 in Florida, New York and was a resident of Orange County. He built and operated a gristmill in Goshen and became one of the town's leading citizens.\n\nHis family originally came to America because his grandfather Johannes Weasner migrated to New York in 1710 along with other Swiss veterans of the English Army who fought under Marlborough in the War of the Spanish Succession.\n\nOrange County first elected him as a representative to Province of New York Assembly in 1759 and returned him for eleven consecutive years. In 1768 he became a judge in the county's court of common pleas. When New York created a revolutionary government in 1775, Wisner was sent to the New York Provincial Congress. That body, in turn, named him as a delegate to the Continental Congress where he served through 1776. Wisner was in Congress when the Declaration of Independence adopted, but the New York delegation was not authorized to declare independence, and so Wisner could not take part in the voting. The claim made years later that Wisner was the only member of the New York delegation to vote in favor of independence seems to be without foundation; he did not vote because he could not vote. After the New York delegation was finally authorized to support the Declaration, a signing ceremony took place in August 1776, but Wisner was not present in Congress to sign.\n\nWhile in Congress, Wisner learned that one of the Continental Army's difficulties was obtaining powder and shot. When he returned home he built three gunpowder mills in Orange and Ulster Counties. At their height he was shipping 1,000 pounds of gunpowder each week to Washington's army. He later financed the erection of cannon and defensive works overlooking the Hudson River, that blocked the British ability to use the river in the Highlands Region. \n\nIn late 1776 Wisner, along with Gilbert Livingston of Poughkeepsie, sounded the Hudson River and, as part of a Secret Committee, recommended the placement of what became known as the Great Chain which stretched from the current location of West Point to Constitution Island. This chain was part of a series of Hudson River Chains designed to thwart British naval movements on the Hudson \n\nIn 1777, serving again in the provincial congress, Wisner was a member of the committee that drafted the first constitution for the state of New York. Under that constitution, Wisner was a member of the state senate from 1777 until 1782. After the war he remained active in civic affairs.\n\nIn 1784, he founded an Academy in Goshen, and was one of the regents of the University of the State of New York from 1784 to 1787. In 1788, Wisner was a delegate to the state convention called to ratify the U.S. Constitution. He was one of those who opposed ratification, fearing that the strong central government would eventually infringe on state and individual rights.\n\nWisner died at home in Goshen in 1790. He was buried in the Old Wallkill Cemetery in Wallkill, New York.\n\nWisner married Sarah Norton in 1739. His son Gabriel, born 1754, died in 1779 in the Battle of Minisink. He married Elizabeth Waters and had three children. His daughter, Sarah Wisner (1745–1810), married Major Moses Phillips (a descendant of the Rev, George Phillips, the Winthrop family through Elizabeth Fones, and Thomas Cornell (settler)), with whom he made gunpowder for George Washington.\n\nMoses Wisner, a collateral descendant, was the 12th Governor of Michigan.\n\nCharles F. Brush, inventor and commercializer of the arc lamp and founder of a predecessor firm of General Electric, is a great great-grandson.\n"}
{"id": "1967967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967967", "title": "Department of Defense Architecture Framework", "text": "Department of Defense Architecture Framework\n\nThe Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) is an architecture framework for the United States Department of Defense (DoD) that provides visualization infrastructure for specific stakeholders concerns through viewpoints organized by various views. These views are artifacts for visualizing, understanding, and assimilating the broad scope and complexities of an architecture description through tabular, structural, behavioral, ontological, pictorial, temporal, graphical, probabilistic, or alternative conceptual means. The current release is DoDAF 2.02.\n\nThis Architecture Framework is especially suited to large systems with complex integration and interoperability challenges, and it is apparently unique in its employment of \"operational views\". These views offer overview and details aimed to specific stakeholders within their domain and in interaction with other domains in which the system will operate.\n\nThe DoDAF provides a foundational framework for developing and representing architecture descriptions that ensure a common denominator for understanding, comparing, and integrating architectures across organizational, joint, and multinational boundaries. It establishes data element definitions, rules, and relationships and a baseline set of products for consistent development of systems, integrated, or federated architectures. These architecture descriptions may include families of systems (FoS), systems of systems (SoS), and net-centric capabilities for interoperating and interacting in the non-combat environment.\n\nDoD Components are expected to conform to DoDAF to the maximum extent possible in development of architectures within the Department. Conformance ensures that reuse of information, architecture artifacts, models, and viewpoints can be shared with common understanding. All major U.S. DoD weapons and information technology system acquisitions are required to develop and document an enterprise architecture (EA) using the views prescribed in the DoDAF. While it is clearly aimed at military systems, DoDAF has broad applicability across the private, public and voluntary sectors around the world, and represents one of a large number of systems architecture frameworks.\n\n\nThe first version of the development DoDAF was developed in the 1990s under the name C4ISR Architecture Framework. In the same period the reference model TAFIM, which was initiated in 1986, was further developed. The first C4ISR Architecture Framework v1.0, released 7 June 1996, was created in response to the passage of the Clinger-Cohen Act. It addressed the 1995 Deputy Secretary of Defense directive that a DoD-wide effort be undertaken to define and develop a better means and process for ensuring that C4ISR capabilities were interoperable and met the needs of the warfighter. Continued development effort resulted in December 1997 in the second version, C4ISR Architecture Framework v2.0.\n\nIn August 2003 the DoDAF v1.0 was released, which restructured the C4ISR Framework v2.0 to offer guidance, product descriptions, and supplementary information in two volumes and a Desk Book. It broadened the applicability of architecture tenets and practices to all Mission Areas rather than just the C4ISR community. This document addressed usage, integrated architectures, DoD and Federal policies, value of architectures, architecture measures, DoD decision support processes, development techniques, analytical techniques, and the CADM v1.01, and moved towards a repository-based approach by placing emphasis on architecture data elements that comprise architecture products. In February 2004 the documentation of Version 1.0 was released with volume \"I: Definitions and Guidelines\", \"II: Product Descriptions\" and a \"Deskbook\". In April 2007 the Version 1.5 was released with a documentation of \"Definitions and Guidelines\", \"Product Descriptions\" and \"Architecture Data Description\".\n\nOn May 28, 2009 DoDAF v2.0 was approved by the Department of Defense. The current version is DoDAF 2.02 \nDoDAF V2.0 is published on a public website.\n\nOther derivative frameworks based on DoDAF include the NATO Architecture Framework (NAF) and Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework. Like other EA approaches, for example The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), DoDAF is organized around a shared repository to hold work products. The repository is defined by the common database schema Core Architecture Data Model 2.0 and the DoD Architecture Registry System (DARS). A key feature of DoDAF is interoperability, which is organized as a series of levels, called Levels of Information System Interoperability (LISI). The developing system must not only meet its internal data needs but also those of the operational framework into which it is set.\n\nSee the diagram for a depiction of the Capabilities Emphasis, as tied in with mission/course of action, threads, activities, and architectures. \nThe DoD has moved toward a focus on the delivery of capabilities, which are the reason for creating the system/service.\nThe Capability Models describe capability taxonomy and capability evolution. \nA capability thread would equate to the specific activities, rules, and systems that are linked to that particular capability.\n\nThe concept of capability, as defined by its Meta-model Data Group allows one to answer questions such as:\nThe Mission or Course of Action is described by a Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and is organized by Capabilities.\n\nThe DoDAF V1.5 defines a set of products, a view model, that act as mechanisms for visualizing, understanding, and assimilating the broad scope and complexities of an architecture description through graphic, tabular, or textual means. These products are organized under four views:\nEach view depicts certain perspectives of an architecture as described below. Only a subset of the full DoDAF viewset is usually created for each system development. The figure represents the information that links the operational view, systems and services view, and technical standards view. The three views and their interrelationships – driven by common architecture data elements – provide the basis for\nderiving measures such as interoperability or performance, and for measuring the impact of the values of these metrics on operational mission and task effectiveness.\n\nAll view (AV) products provide overarching descriptions of the entire architecture and define the scope and context of the architecture. The DoDAF V1.5 AV products are defined as:\n\nOperational View (OV) products provide descriptions of the tasks and activities, operational elements, and information exchanges required to accomplish DoD missions. The OV provides textual and graphical representations of operational nodes and elements, assigned tasks and activities, and information flows between nodes. It defines the type of information exchanged, the frequency of exchanges, the tasks and activities supported by these exchanges and the nature of the exchanges. The DoDAF V1.5 OV products are defined as:\n\nSystems and services view (SV) is a set of graphical and textual products that describe systems and services and interconnections providing for, or supporting, DoD functions. SV products focus on specific physical systems with specific physical (geographical) locations. The relationship between architecture data elements across the SV to the OV can be exemplified as systems are procured and fielded to support organizations and their operations. The DoDAF V1.5 SV products are:\n\nTechnical standards view (TV) products define technical standards, implementation conventions, business rules and criteria that govern the architecture. The DoDAF V1.5 TV products are as follows:\n\nIn DoDAF V2.0, architectural viewpoints are composed of data that has been organized to facilitate understanding. To align with ISO Standards, where appropriate, the terminology has changed from Views to Viewpoint (e.g., the Operational View is now the Operational Viewpoint).\n\n\nThe architectures for DoDAF V1.0 and DoDAF V1.5 may continue to be used. When appropriate (usually indicated by policy or by the decision-maker), DoDAF V1.0 and V1.5 architectures will need to update their architecture. When pre-DoDAF V2.0 architecture is compared with DoDAF V2.0 architecture, concept differences (such as Node) must be defined or explained for the newer architecture. In regard to DoDAF V1.5 products, they have been transformed into parts of the DoDAF V2.0 models. In most cases, the DoDAF V2.0 Meta-model supports the DoDAF V1.5 data concepts, with one notable exception: Node. Node is a complex, logical concept that is represented with more concrete concepts.\n\n\n\n\nNote, see Logical data model for discussion of the relationship of these three DIV data models, with comparison of the Conceptual, Logical & Physical Data Models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DODAF 2.0 Architects Guide repeated DOD Instruction 4630.8 definition of an integrated architecture as \"An architecture consisting of multiple views facilitating integration and promoting interoperability across capabilities and among integrated architectures.\" For the purposes of architecture development, the term integrated means that data required in more than one of the architectural models is commonly defined and understood across those models. Integrated architectures are a property or design principle for architectures at all levels: Capability,Component, Solution, and Enterprise (in the context of the DoD Enterprise Architecture (EA) being a federation [of] architectures). In simpler terms, integration is seen in the connection from items common among architecture products, where items shown in one architecture product (such as sites used or systems interfaced or services provided) should have the identical number, name, and meaning appear in related architecture product views.\"\n\nThere are many different approaches for creating an integrated architecture using DoDAF and for determining which products are required. The approach depends on the requirements and the expected results; i.e., what the resulting architecture will be used for.\nAs one example, the DoDAF v1.0 listed the following products as the \"minimum set of products required to satisfy the definition of an OV, SV and TV.\" One note: while the DoDAF does not list the OV-1 artifact as a core product, its development is strongly encouraged. The sequence of the artifacts listed below gives a suggested order in which the artifacts could be developed. The actual sequence of view generation and their potential customization is a function of the application domain and the specific needs of the effort.\n\nOne concern about the DoDAF is how well these products meet actual stakeholder concerns for any given system of interest. One can view DoDAF products, or at least the 3 views, as ANSI/IEEE 1471-2000 or ISO/IEC 42010 \"viewpoints\". But to build an architecture description that corresponds to ANSI/IEEE 1471-2000 or ISO/IEC 42010, it is necessary to clearly identify the stakeholders and their concerns that map to each selected DoDAF product. Otherwise there is the risk of producing products with no customers.\n\nThe figure \"DoDAF V1.5 Products Matrix\" shows how the DoD Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6212.01E specifies which DoDAF V1.5 products are required for each type of analysis, in the context of the Net-Ready Key Performance Parameter (NR-KPP):\n\nRepresentations for the DoDAF products may be drawn from many diagramming techniques including:\nThere is a UPDM (Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF) effort within the OMG to standardize the representation of DoDAF products when UML is used.\n\nDoDAF generically describes in the representation of the artifacts to be generated, but allows considerable flexibility regarding the specific formats and modeling techniques. The DoDAF deskbook provides examples in using traditional systems engineering and data engineering techniques, and secondly, UML format. DoDAF proclaims latitude in work product format, without professing one diagramming technique over another.\n\nIn addition to graphical representation, there is typically a requirement to provide metadata to the Defense Information Technology Portfolio Repository (DITPR) or other architectural repositories.\n\nDoDAF has a meta-model underpinning the framework, defining the types of modelling elements that can be used in each view and the relationships between them. DoDAF versions 1.0 thru 1.5 used the CADM meta-model, which was defined in IDEF1X (then later in UML) with an XML Schema derived from the resulting relational database. From version 2.0, DoDAF has adopted the IDEAS Group foundation ontology as the basis for its new meta-model. This new meta-model is called \"DM2\"; an acronym for \"DoDAF Meta-Model\". Each of these three levels of the DM2 is important to a particular viewer of Departmental processes:\n\nThe purposes of the DM2 are:\n\nThe DM2 defines architectural data elements and enables the integration and federation of Architectural Descriptions. It establishes a basis for semantic (i.e., understanding) consistency within and across Architectural Descriptions. In this manner, the DM2 supports the exchange and reuse of architectural information among JCAs, Components, and Federal and Coalition partners, thus facilitating the understanding and implementation of interoperability of processes and systems. As the DM2 matures to meet the ongoing data requirements of process owners, decision makers, architects, and new technologies, it will evolve to a resource that more completely supports the requirements for architectural data, published in a consistently understandable way, and will enable greater ease for discovering, sharing, and reusing architectural data across organizational boundaries.\n\nTo facilitate the use of information at the data layer, the DoDAF describes a set of models for visualizing data through graphic, tabular, or textual means. These views relate to stakeholder requirements for producing an Architectural Description.\n\nThe UPDM (Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF) is an OMG initiative to standardize UML and SysML usage for USA and UK defense architecture frameworks. In addition, the multi-national IDEAS Group, which is supported by Australia, Canada, Sweden, UK, USA, with NATO observers, has launched an initiative to develop a formal ontology for enterprise architectures.\n\nThe efficacy of DoDAF at the U.S. Department of Defense for developing enterprise architecture has been debated:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1967979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967979", "title": "Jorge Semprún", "text": "Jorge Semprún\n\nJorge Semprún Maura (; 10 December 1923 – 7 June 2011) was a Spanish writer and politician who lived in France most of his life and wrote primarily in French. From 1953 to 1962, during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, Semprún lived clandestinely in Spain working as an organizer for the exiled Communist Party of Spain, but was expelled from the party in 1964. After the death of Franco and change to a democratic government, he served as Minister of Culture in Spain's socialist government from 1988 to 1991. He was a screenwriter for two successive films by the Greek director Costa-Gavras, \"Z\" (1969) and \"The Confession\" (1970), which dealt with the theme of persecution by governments. For his work on the films \"The War Is Over\" (1966) and \"Z\" (1969) Semprún was nominated for the Academy Award. In 1996, he became the first non-French author elected to the \"Académie Goncourt\", which awards an annual literary prize.\n\nJorge Semprún Maura was born in 1923 in Madrid. His mother was Susana Maura Gamazo, the youngest daughter of Antonio Maura, who served several times as prime minister of Spain. His father, José María Semprún Gurrea (1893–1966), was a liberal politician and served as a diplomat for the Republic of Spain during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nIn the wake of the military uprising led by General Franco in July 1936, the Semprún family moved to France, and then to The Hague where his father was a diplomat, representing the Republic of Spain in the Netherlands. After the Netherlands officially recognized the Franco government in the beginning of 1939, the family returned to France as refugees. Jorge Semprún enrolled there at the Lycée Henri IV and later the Sorbonne.\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation of France, the young Semprún joined the \"Francs-Tireurs et Partisans – Main-d'Œuvre Immigrée\" (FTP-MOI), a Resistance organization made up mostly of immigrants. After joining the Spanish Communist Party in 1942 in France, Semprún was reassigned to the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP), the Communist armed Resistance. In 1943 he was arrested by the Gestapo and deported to Buchenwald concentration camp for his role in the Resistance. He deals with the experiences in two books: \"Le grand voyage\" (1963) treats the journey to Buchenwald, and \"Quel beau dimanche!\" (1980) his camp experiences.\n\nIn 1945 Semprún returned to France and became an active member of the exiled Communist Party of Spain (PCE). From 1953 to 1962, he was an important organizer of the PCE's clandestine activities in Spain, using the pseudonym of Federico Sánchez. He entered the party's executive committee in 1956. In 1964 he was expelled from the party because of \"differences regarding the party line\", and from then on he concentrated on his writing career.\n\nSemprún wrote many novels, plays, and screenplays, for which he received several nominations, including an Academy Award in 1970, and awards, including the 1997 Jerusalem Prize. He was a screenwriter for two successive films by the Greek director Costa-Gavras, dealing with the theme of persecution by governments, \"Z\" (1969) and \"The Confession\" (1970). For his work on \"Z\", he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay but did not win.\n\nHe was a member of the jury at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. In 1988 he was appointed Minister of Culture in Felipe González's second government, despite being neither an elected MP nor a member of the Socialist Party (PSOE). He resigned the post three years later after publishing an article openly criticising the vice-president, Alfonso Guerra, and his brother Juan Guerra.\n\nIn 1996, Semprún became the first non-French author to be elected to the \"Académie Goncourt\", which awards an annual prize for literature written in French. In 2002, he was awarded the inaugural Ovid Prize in recognition of his entire body of work, which focuses on \"tolerance and freedom of expression\".\n\nJorge Semprún served as the honorary chairman of the Spanish branch of Action Against Hunger. He lived in Paris.\n\nSemprún married the actress Loleh Bellon in 1949. Their son, Jaime Semprún (1947–2010), was also a writer. Later Semprún married the French film editor Colette Leloup in 1958. They had five children: Dominique Semprún, Ricardo Semprún, Lourdes Semprún, Juan Semprún and Pablo Semprún. He is the brother of the writer Carlos Semprún (1926-2009).\n\nSemprún wrote primarily in French and alludes to French authors as much as to Spanish ones. Most of his books are fictionalized accounts of his deportation to Buchenwald. His writing is non-linear and achronological. The narrative setting shifts back and forth in time, exploring the past and future in relation to key events. With each recounting, events take on different meanings. Semprún's works are self-reflexive. His narrators explore how events live on in memory and means of communicating the events of the concentration camp to readers who cannot fathom that experience. His more recent work in this vein also includes reflections on the meaning of Europe and of being European, as informed by this period of history, including how Buchenwald was reopened by Soviet forces as Special Camp No. 2 of the NKVD, and then largely razed and planted over by East Germany to hide the mass graves from this second dark episode.\n\nSemprún's writing in Spanish deals with Spanish subject matter, and includes two volumes of memoirs: \"Autobiografía de Federico Sánchez\", about his clandestine work in and later exclusion from the Spanish Communist Party (1953–64), and \"Federico Sánchez se despide de ustedes\", which deals with his term of service as Minister of Culture in the second Socialist government of Felipe González (1988–91). A novel in Spanish, \"Veinte años y un día\", is set in 1956 and deals with recent history in Spain.\n\nSemprún's first book, \"Le grand voyage\" (\"The Long Voyage\" in English; republished as \"The Cattle Truck\" in 2005 by Serif), was published in 1963 by Gallimard. It recounts Semprún's deportation and incarceration in Buchenwald in fictionalized form. A feature of the novel, and with Semprún's work in general, is its fractured chronology. The work recounts his train journey and arrival at the concentration camp. During the long trip, the narrator provides the reader with flashbacks to his experiences in the French Resistance and flash-forwards to life in the camp and after liberation. The novel won two literary prizes, the \"Prix Formentor\" and \"Prix littéraire de la Résistance\" (\"Literary Prize of the Resistance\").\n\nIn 1977, his \"Autobiografía de Federico Sánchez\" (\"Autobiography of Federico Sánchez\") won the Premio Planeta, the most highly remunerated literary prize in Spain. In spite of the pseudonymous title, the work is Semprún's least fictionalized volume of autobiography, recounting his life as a member of the central committee of the Spanish Communist Party (PCE), and his undercover activities in Spain between 1953 and 1964. The book shows a stark view of Communist organizations during the Cold War, and presents a very critical portrait of leading figures of the PCE, including Santiago Carrillo and Dolores Ibárruri.\n\n\"What a Beautiful Sunday\" (\"Quel beau dimanche!\"), his novel of life in Buchenwald and after liberation was published by Grasset in 1980. It purports to tell what it was like to live one day, hour by hour, in the concentration camp, but like Semprún's other novels, the narrator recounts events that precede and follow that day. In part, Semprún was inspired by \"A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\" by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and the work contains a criticism of Stalinism as well as fascism.\n\n\"Literature or Life\" was published by Gallimard in 1994. The French title, \"L'Ecriture ou la vie\", might be better translated as \"Writing or Life\". Semprún explores themes related to deportation, but the focus is on living with the memory of the experience and how to write about it. Semprún revisits scenes from previous works and gives rationales for his literary choices.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1967983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967983", "title": "Boss Hogg", "text": "Boss Hogg\n\nJefferson Davis \"J.D.\" Hogg, known as Boss Hogg, is a fictional character featured in the American television series \"The Dukes of Hazzard\". He was the greedy, unethical commissioner of Hazzard County. A stereotypical villainous glutton, Boss Hogg almost always wore an all-white suit with a white cowboy hat and regularly smoked cigars. His namesake is Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederate States of America. Boss Hogg is one of only two characters to appear in every episode of the TV series, the other being Uncle Jesse Duke. The role of Boss Hogg was played by Sorrell Booke, who performed frequently on radio, stage, and film prior to his role in \"The Dukes of Hazzard\".\n\n\"Boss\" Hogg was the sole commissioner of Hazzard County, Georgia, and thus held all executive and judicial powers therein. (In real life, Georgia is the only state which still allows this form of government, and in only nine of its 159 counties.) As the wealthiest man in the county, he would do \"almost\" anything to get his hands on more money, including executing many nefarious and criminal schemes. However, he does not tolerate anyone (even the Dukes, despite Hogg's constant rivalry with them) getting physically hurt in the process (showing that he does have \"some\" scruples), he also refuses to have anything to do with illegal drugs, regardless of money, making him one of the few TV villains with any such sense of personal ethics. Boss Hogg is described in one analysis as \"an ineffectual bad guy—hence amusing\".\n\nHogg owned most of Hazzard's property and businesses, either directly or by holding the mortgages over the land. His lust for money often drove him to participate in criminal activities—usually by enlisting the aid of associates—mainly his right-hand man and partner in crime, the dim-witted, bumbling Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane. Together, the two schemed to frame the Duke family for crimes they did not commit. Rosco's deputies, Enos Strate and Cletus Hogg (Boss's cousin), have also aided Boss Hogg, though Enos (and to a lesser extent, Cletus) were decidedly more reluctant to do so. According to Waylon Jennings's narration, he had a \"cradle to grave\" earning plan; in that if you were a Hazzard County resident, you were born at the local hospital (owned by Hogg), you lived in a house that he owned the deed to, worked at one of his businesses, and when you died, his casket company would make your pine box.\n\nBoss Hogg's greed only seemed to fuel his lust for more and more wealth. He was chauffeured around in the back of a Cadillac (though he drove himself around in later seasons), all-white in color to match his all-white suit. Other clothing (such as jogging suits, etc.) and much of his other accessories, and much of his own mansion home, were also decked out in white.\n\nBoss is forever angry at the Duke family, particularly Bo and Luke, for continually exposing and halting his various crooked schemes. Despite the Dukes coming to his rescue on occasion, Hogg forever seems to have an irrational dislike of the clan, particularly Bo and Luke, often accusing them of spying on him, robbing or planning to rob him, and other supposedly nefarious actions as he believes they are generally out to get him. Although this characteristic is present throughout the show's run, it is particularly evident in the earlier seasons. One episode has Uncle Jesse mentioning that he and Boss had known one another \"since we were kids\", and others mention that they had run moonshine together.\n\nJust like the exact specifications of the Duke Boys' probation rules, the extent of just what was and wasn't within Boss's powers often seemed to vary from episode to episode. However, this can be countermanded slightly, as Boss would often bend the law and make up rules to suit himself.\n\nEvery morning, Boss Hogg would drink coffee and eat raw liver (as seen in the pilot episode, \"One Armed Bandits\" and several later episodes). Method actor Sorrell Booke actually ate the raw liver.\n\nSorrell Booke was only slightly overweight at best. He wore padding under his suit to give Boss his familiar 62 inch waist.\n\nInitially the character was created as a corrupt, gruff nemesis for the Duke family to battle, but as the series evolved over its first and subsequent seasons, Hogg developed more into a comical money-grabbing villain, more intent on various get-rich-quick schemes and shady plots than ever knowingly causing anyone serious harm. With this evolution of the character, for which the foundations were set over the course of the first half-season, came the closer pairing of Hogg and bumbling Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best), and as the pair's comical ability together became apparent and a popular element of the series, Booke and Best were often given permission to ad-lib and improvise their scenes together.\n\nBy the time of the 1997 reunion movie, Booke had died, so rather than replace him with a new actor or similar character, Hogg's death was written into the script. He willed his empire to Rosco P. Coltrane, who continued to pursue zany schemes, many of which Boss came up with before his death.\n\nIn a typical episode of \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", Boss hires others to carry out his crimes, then diverts the blame onto the Dukes, usually the cousins Bo and Luke. Some of Hogg's favorite schemes include bank and armored car robbery, counterfeiting, fraud, and moonshine running. He especially enjoyed trying to trick Bo and Luke into violating their probation (for illegal transportation of moonshine) by running moonshine or crossing the county line.\n\nBoss reasons that by framing Bo and Luke, he will more easily acquire the Duke farm—the property he most covets, and for which he held the mortgage—for little to no cost. Usually, this is so he can develop the land (for profit, of course) in various ways. When the Dukes are not targeted, it is generally a friend of the Dukes—auto mechanic Cooter Davenport, postmistress Miz Emma Tisdale, county worker Emery Potter, general store owner Mr. Rhuebottom, and others—who find themselves on the wrong side of Hogg's schemes.\n\nIt is usually up to Bo and Luke to foil Boss's schemes, defeat his associates, and make things right. Though Boss's crimes should land him in prison, he usually winds up with little more than a slap on the wrist, such as donating his ill-gotten proceeds to charity or having to personally re-sow by hand a crop that he had destroyed. He often worms his way out of trouble by foisting the blame for his schemes onto associates. This has left him with a reputation for untrustworthiness and double-crossing in the criminal world and made many enemies who come back for revenge.\n\nBoss lusts for \"simoleons\", but has his limits; he refuses to risk anyone's life or safety for the sake of his schemes. More than once, he has sacrificed his potential earnings to save lives that would otherwise be imperiled by his greed (this is especially true in later seasons). His conscience has landed him into trouble with his former partners in the past. He stands by his word, but only if he \"spits and shakes\" on it. On several occasions, when Boss's disgruntled or devious associates attempted to exact revenge for Boss's betrayal, Bo and Luke almost always came to his rescue.\n\nBoss held various positions in the community including County Commissioner, Police Commissioner, Chief of the Volunteer Fire Department, Justice of the Peace and Bank President. All of these organizations seemed to suffer from his greed. It seems in some episodes that his position of County Commissioner is elected; Hogg was even once defeated for this office (by one vote, cast at the last minute), but Boss was back in charge in the following episode.\n\nBoss constantly looks for new, usually dishonest, methods to bring revenue into the county (and thereby, into his pocketbook). Some of the more memorable schemes involve Rosco setting up fake fire hydrants next to parked cars, using hair dryers as radar guns (to ticket people for speeding), and placing hidden stop signs or speed limit signs that mysteriously spring into view after an unsuspecting motorist drives by.\n\nBoss's traffic schemes have also resulted in country music and other performers \"working off\" their fines by performing at \"The Boar's Nest\". Famous singer victims include: Roy Orbison, Buck Owens, Mel Tillis, Dottie West, Tammy Wynette, Hoyt Axton, Johnny Paycheck and The Oak Ridge Boys twice, Loretta Lynn, and Mickey Gilley, whose performance he also tried to pirate.\n\nDespite Boss Hogg's unending desire to have Bo and Luke imprisoned for crimes they did not commit, his principal rival always remained their uncle, Jesse Duke. Jesse and J.D. had a feud dating back to their ridge-running days in the 1930s, which continued to simmer after Bo and Luke were indicted for moonshine-running and Jesse began protecting them from J.D.\n\nThough they rarely got along, Jesse and J.D. held a grudging respect for one another and enjoyed a \"friendship\" of sorts (Jesse once claimed he and Hogg were \"friends and enemies\"), as both would help each other when circumstances warranted. However, Jesse Duke was well aware of J.D.'s greedy nature, and the wizened Duke patriarch frequently warned his nephews and niece about Hogg's antics. When Uncle Jesse needed a favor of Boss Hogg, he would often say \"I've never asked you for anything\", and the question appeared new to the portly Hogg each time. Furthermore, whenever Jesse and J.D. do formally agree to something, it is always with a \"spit and shake\" of hands; in one episode, J.D. insists that without \"spit and shake\", any promises made by him are not binding. In one episode where Hogg becomes involved with some very serious criminals who threaten Jesse's life, he intervenes and desperately insists that they don't hurt him.\n\nDespite the fact that they constantly thwarted his plots, and while he often derided them even when they were helping him, Hogg was willing to swallow his pride when the Dukes offered him aid; while the Dukes have no love for Hogg, it is clear they are aware that Boss has never willingly put lives at risk. Hogg and the Dukes appear to almost enjoy their rivalry on some level, as Hogg could easily have foreclosed on the mortgage he holds on the Dukes' land long ago, yet never has; either Boss is honest enough to accept the Dukes' payments to keep their land in their possession, or he merely wants the satisfaction of removing them via one of his schemes. (Whether Hogg genuinely wants the Dukes out of the way or is simply harassing them for fun is never made clear.) The Dukes, for their part, thoroughly enjoy their clashes with Hogg when thwarting him despite the issues he causes. Despite this, they have never made any serious attempt to have him removed from his position via any of their friends who can cross the Hazzard county line and report on his corrupt actions, indicating that they are unwilling to see Hogg truly placed in legal trouble despite all the issues he causes for them. Whether this is out of respect for Hogg's strange friendship with their uncle Jesse or not was never revealed.\n\nBoss is married to Rosco's \"fat sister\", Lulu Coltrane Hogg, making Boss and Rosco brothers-in-law. In the first episode, \"One Armed Bandits\", and referenced again in some later episodes, Boss mentions that she had him give Rosco the role of Sheriff so that he would have a safe job. It is this \"debt\" that, in the earliest episodes at least, seems to have Rosco continually working for Boss in repayment.\n\nAs with several of the other characters, the version of Lulu seen in the early episodes is slightly different to the version portrayed later. In her lone first season appearance (\"Repo Men\"), she is played as spoiled (she is seen to be demanding that Boss buy her a Rolls Royce for her birthday). Her single second season appearances (in \"The Rustlers\") also shows her in a similar light. As the character progressed and appeared on a more regular basis in the series, the character softened, becoming a kind and more level-headed woman involved with several local charities and projects. Although in some earlier instances she didn't seem keen on the Dukes, she was more hospitable towards them, and by the later seasons was often seen to be on friendly terms with the family - particularly Jesse, with whom she would occasionally consort if she thought Boss was getting himself too deep into trouble. She and Daisy also seemed to hold a friendship as she hired Daisy into the Hazzard Equal Rights Society and in a later episode they were seen to be returning together from an out-of-town shopping trip.\n\nAlthough Boss frequently takes his wife for granted, Lulu has no patience for Boss's shady antics and is clearly the dominant personality in the relationship, even acting as her husband's Achilles' heel in his latest crooked scheme (and succeeding on occasion). At one point, she threatens to leave Boss and take half of his holdings; he quickly backs down. While apprehensive to trust her, and scheming behind her back at all times, Boss seems to genuinely love Lulu, frequently calling her such petnames, as \"Angel Food Cake\", \"Marshmallow\", and \"Sugarplum Puddin'.\"\n\nBoss also has an antithetical identical twin brother, Abraham Lincoln Hogg, who appeared in one episode of the show (the third season's \"Baa, Baa White Sheep\"). Also played by Booke, A.L Hogg is the opposite of J.D.—he was kind, honest, law-abiding, dressed in black, and drove a black Cadillac—and was friendly with the Dukes, particularly Uncle Jesse.\n\nBoss and Lulu are childless, but have at least two nephews: Hughie Hogg and Jamie Lee Hogg (Jonathan Frakes). Like their uncle, both Hughie and Jamie Lee are often up to no good: Hughie (who, like his uncle, wore an all-white three-piece suit, though he drove a Volkswagen Beetle, in stark contrast to Boss's Cadillac) is often more crooked than Boss Hogg and is seen in some episodes blackmailing and using wise tactics, while Jamie Lee is seen in only one episode (see below).\n\nIn the third-season episode \"The Late J.D. Hogg\", Boss is wrongly diagnosed with a fatal illness and adopts a nice, kind persona, only to revert to his usual crooked, mean self when he learns that he is not really about to die.\n\nIn \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" (Episode: #7.5 – original airdate: 19 October 1984), Boss Hogg suffered amnesia as a result of being hit on the head. When he awakened, he was a kind, caring, honest and fair man who intended to \"clean up Hazzard County of all corruption\". He did not like being referred to as \"Boss\" or even as \"J.D.\", instead identifying himself as \"Jefferson Davis Hogg with two G's\", or just \"Jefferson\" for short. Jefferson actually liked and appreciated the Dukes for the help they bring to Hazzard, and helped them whenever he could—until he received another bump on the head (many times, via Rosco) and turned back into the ruthless, corrupt Boss Hogg.\n\nBoss Hogg's car was a triple white 1970 Cadillac DeVille (1976 Cadillac Eldorado in the 2005 film) convertible, with large bull horns for a hood ornament, and in the movies sported pistol shaped door handles. He had a chauffeur named Alex, who drove the car in the first few seasons; in later years, Hogg became the car's principal driver and frequently challenged others by invoking his driving expertise from his days as a ridge-runner. Unlike other vehicles in the series, Boss Hogg's Cadillac is typically handled carefully and he was always blaming Cooter if even the smallest thing went wrong.\n\nSome of Boss Hogg's holdings (either directly or by mortgage) include:\n\n\n\nIn \"Moonrunners\"—the precursor film to the \"Dukes of Hazzard\"—the character that would go on to be developed into Boss Hogg, was named Jake Rainey (played by George Ellis). Like Boss Hogg, Jake was an old friend of Uncle Jessie, who had risen from running moonshine with Jessie in the old days to boss of the county. Jake also had the loyalty of Sheriff Rosco Coltrane, although this bond wasn't as close as it was in the TV series.\n\nBurt Reynolds played Boss Hogg in \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" (2005), the big-screen remake of the TV series. This version of Boss was far more serious and wily than his TV counterpart. Although it was indicated that this Boss Hogg enjoyed fine cuisine and had a slightly enlarged belly, he was not the overweight glutton of the television series.\n\nChris McDonald played Boss Hogg in \"\" (2007). Much like Reynolds' portrayal, Hogg was not overweight as his TV series version was, although he was decidedly taller (McDonald is 6'3\", nine inches taller than Booke was).\n\nBoss Hogg appears in the game \"\", voiced by Wayne Powers.\n\nBoss, voiced by Sorrell Booke himself, appeared in a cartoon titled simply \"The Dukes\". This cartoon lasted for two seasons, both in 1983 for a total of 20 episodes.\n\nHe has been described as a \"stereotypical corrupt public figure\" as well as a stereotypical \"Southerner\".\n"}

{"id": "1967989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967989", "title": "Islamic Society of North America", "text": "Islamic Society of North America\n\nThe Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), based in Plainfield, Indiana, USA, is a Muslim umbrella group. It has been described in the media as the largest Muslim organization in North America. ISNA holds an annual national convention which is generally regarded as the largest annual gathering of American Muslims to discuss their role in society, politics, public media, activism, educational institutions, etc.\n\nISNA traces its origins to a meeting of several Muslim student organizations in 1963, at which the Muslim Student Association of the U.S. & Canada (\"The MSA\") was formed in January 1963. ISNA regards the MSA's 1963 convention as its first one, held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Present-day ISNA was founded in 1982 through a joint effort of four organizations: The Muslim Students Association of the US and Canada (The MSA), Islamic Medical Association (IMA), the Association of Muslim Social Scientists (AMSS), and the Association of Muslim Scientists and Engineers (AMSE) - to create a community-oriented organization due to the changing nature of the growing Muslim community. Many of the leaders of these four founding organizations took leadership roles in the newly formed ISNA. In 1983, ISNA completed a $21 million ($ today) headquarters complex in suburban Indianapolis using funds raised in part from international sources. On August 30, 2013, Tahera Ahmad became the first woman to recite the Quran to open the ISNA convention, which she did at the 50th annual ISNA convention in front of a mixed-gender audience.\n\nISNA's goal is \"to be an exemplary and unifying Islamic organization in North America that contributes to the betterment of the Muslim community and society at large.\" ISNA is an association of Muslim organizations and individuals that provides a common platform for presenting Islam, supporting Muslim communities, developing educational, social and outreach programs and fostering good relations with other religious communities, and civic and service organizations.\n\nSince 1982, ISNA's structure has changed, with several organizations either becoming defunct, or simply leaving ISNA's umbrella. Currently, ISNA includes under its umbrella: Muslim Student Association (MSA), the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), Canadian Islamic Trust Foundation (CITF; NAIT's counterpart in Canada), Association of Muslim Scientists and Engineers (AMSE), Islamic Medical Association of North America (IMANA), and the Muslim Youth of North America (MYNA). Other organizations that either left ISNA or were disbanded include: Muslim Communities Association (MCA), Islamic Teaching Center (ITC), the Association of Muslim Social Scientists (AMSS), Islamic Media Foundation (IMF), and Foundation for International Development (FID), among others. Although each of the umbrella groups under ISNA has a seat in the ISNA Board of Directors, ISNA itself has no reciprocal seat or say in the leadership of the lower umbrella groups.\n\nISNA provides various services for Muslim immigrants and Muslim communities in North America. It used to publish information about Islam to be distributed with the intention of informing Muslims and non-Muslims about various issues in the religion, however this role was filled by a separate, unaffiliated organization, the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA). They provide a forum for discussing aging and mortality as well as domestic violence. ISNA-Canada, a separately-run but loosely affiliated Canadian non-profit entity, also certifies food service and consumer products companies as \"Halal\", and issues Islamic marriage certificates to couples with a marriage license who have performed the religious ceremony.\n\nAlthough only a small percentage of mosques are official members, mosque membership in ISNA is an important step for many small communities trying to grow. ISNA also offers individual membership on an annual basis and lifetime basis for sustaining donors.\n\nISNA holds an annual national convention, typically on the Labor Day weekend in early September, which is generally regarded as the largest annual gathering of American Muslims in the United States. In the last few years, it has been held most frequently in Chicago, Illinois. The convention features Islamic lectures, discussions, debates, nasheeds, and Muslim comedy. A notable comedian who has repeatedly performed at ISNA is Azhar Usman. In 2012, the ISNA Convention was held in Washington, D.C. Deputy U.S. Attorney General, Thomas Perez, addressed the 2012 Convention, and other prominent representatives of the White House have attended in the past, including Valerie Jarrett, President Obama's Senior Advisor for Engagement and International Affairs in 2009 and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2016.\n\n\"Islamic Horizons\" is ISNA's bi-monthly publication of ISNA, featuring news from within the Muslim community around the nation, as well as articles addressing topics relevant to Muslim Americans.\n\nISNA-Canada, an independent, Canadian-incorporated organization, is the operator and owner of the Islamic Society of North America Elementary School in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe ISNA is led by the ISNA Executive Council with decisions ratified by a Board of Directors (Majlis Ash-Shura). A prominent former president of the ISNA Executive Council was Mohamed Magid, whose term ended in 2014. The ISNA Secretary General is Hazem Bata. Azhar Azeez is the current president. Former ISNA Secretary General Dr. Sayyid Syeed is the National Director for the Office of Interfaith & Community Alliances for ISNA.\n\nISNA invited Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, to speak before its 44th annual meeting (2007). Reform Judaism is the largest Jewish denomination in the US. Yoffie denounced \"opportunists\" who demonise Islam, and called for an end to racial profiling and legal discrimination against Muslim Americans. Yoffie drew frequent applause, and a standing ovation. David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee, criticized Yoffie.\n\nISNA also invited Rick Warren to address the 2009 annual ISNA convention. Rabbis, evangelical and Catholic leaders were also present.\n\nISNA has participated in interfaith dialogue with the U.S. Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.\n\nIn 2016, ISNA and the American Jewish Committee formed the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council to address rising bigotry against Jews and Muslims in the United States.\n\nFormer US Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) said that the Islamic Society of North America is \"accused of ties to Islamic extremists\", and investigative journalist Steven Emerson accused ISNA of ties to terrorism, and argued that ISNA is not as moderate as some \"would like to believe\". Others such as Rabbi Marc Schneier, president and founder of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, argue ISNA and other Islamic groups are too often condemned because of \"extreme outliers\".\n\nISNA was one of a number of Muslim groups investigated by US law enforcement for possible terrorist connections. Its tax records were requested in December 2003 by the Senate Finance Committee. However, the committee's investigation concluded in November 2005 having found no evidence of ties to terrorists. Committee chairman Charles Grassley said, \"We did not find anything alarming enough that required additional follow-up beyond what law enforcement is already doing.\"\n\nIn the 2007 Holy Land Foundation terrorist financing case, the United States Department of Justice named ISNA, along with Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), as an unindicted co-conspirator and one of a number of \"entities who are and/or were members of the US Muslim Brotherhood.\" ISNA, along with NAIT and CAIR, filed motions seeking to be removed from the UCC listing, and the District Judge found that the government had violated the organizations' rights by listing them as Unindicted Co-Conspirators. Judge Solis, as affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, held that the government should not have listed CAIR and ISNA, but that \"the government has produced ample evidence to establish the associations of CAIR, ISNA, NAIT, with the Islamic Association for Palestine, and with Hamas\".\n\nAn audit of the separately run but loosely-affiliated ISNA Canada, from 2007–2009, found that only a quarter of the funds donated to the organization went to help the poor. Charity donations were mostly spent on the administration of the center or misdirected to private businesses. On September 21, 2013, the Canada Revenue Agency revoked the registration of ISNA Development Foundation, a defunct-charity that operated out of ISNA Canada's headquarters, due to the disbursement of funds to private businesses, including an organization linked to the Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist group. ISNA Canada was not affected by this move, and still has its charitable status, as can be found on the Canada Revenue Agency's website.\nIn his testimony before the US Senate in October 2003, Dr. Michael Waller told Senators, that \"The Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) refers Muslim clerics to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. The Islamic Society of North America is an influential front for the promotion of the Wahhabi political, ideological and theological infrastructure in the United States and Canada.\" Claiming that ISNA has connections to 50 to 79 percent of mosques on the North American continent, he accused the organization of \"dominating Islam in North America.\"\n\nSimilarly, Stephen Schwartz described ISNA in Senate hearing testimony as \"maintain[ing] open and close relations with the Saudi government\".\n\nA speaker at the 2009 national convention, Warith Deen Umar, a New York imam, asserted that the Holocaust happened to the Jews \"because they were serially disobedient to Allah.\" He went on to allege that a group of Jews close to President Barack Obama \"control the world\". ISNA condemned the comments.\n\nAt the July 2017 annual convention of ISNA, representatives from \"Muslims for Progressive Values\" and Human Rights Campaign (LGBT rights groups) were asked to shut down their booth and leave, given \"that the convention was a religious, private, and family-oriented event.\"\n\n\n"}

She was one of a group of five women who were the first to be admitted to study at Newnham College as part of Cambridge University.\n\nPaley was born in the village of Ufford, near Stamford, Lincolnshire, second daughter of the Reverend Thomas Paley and his wife Judith . Her father was Rector of Ufford and a former Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge. She was a great-granddaughter of the theologian and philosopher William Paley.\n\nShe was educated at home, excelling in languages: in 1871, after performing well in entrance exams, she earned a scholarship to become one of the first five students at the recently founded Newnham College in Cambridge. She took the Moral Sciences Tripos in 1874, and was classed between a first and second-class, though as a woman she was debarred from graduation. Paley sat the exam with Amy Bulley. They were some of the first women to take tripos examinations and they sat the exams in Marion and Benjamin Hall Kennedy's drawing room. Paley described Professor Kennedy as excitable, but he would sometimes doze whilst invigilating. The only evidence she was given of her work was a confidential letter from her examiners. Women sitting the tripos examination was a milestone for Cambridge University and the importance can be gauged by the people involved. The people who delivered Paley and Bulley's papers were Alfred Marshall, Henry Sidgwick, John Venn and Sedley Taylor. She was to pass with honours but this did not entitle her to an official degree. Cambridge was to resist recognising its own women graduates; a restriction that was, later, to be supported by her future husband.\n\nIn 1875 she was the 25 year old economics lecturer at Newnham College. Marshall had established herself financially as she was the first women lecturer at Cambridge University. She was stylish and known for wearing clothes made from the fashionable prints designed by the Pre-Raphaelites.\n\nIn 1876, she became engaged to Alfred Marshall who had been her economics tutor, and was at that time a strong supporter in higher education for women. In 1878 they moved to found the teaching of economics at University College, Bristol. Mary was one of the first women lecturers, although her salary was taken from her husband's pay as a Professor. In 1883 she followed him to Oxford, before the couple returned to Cambridge in 1885 where they built and moved into Balliol Croft (renamed Marshall House in 1991) on Madingley Road. Mary lectured on economics, and she was asked to develop a book from her Cambridge lectures. Mary and Alfred wrote \"The Economics of Industry\" together, published in 1879. Alfred disliked the book, however, and it eventually went out of print, even though there was moderate demand for it. Alfred had also changed his mind about women students at Cambridge. He wrote pamphlets and letters objecting to a mixed university, and in 1897 a university law was passed preventing women from being given a Cambridge degree. \n\nThere is no record of her publicly disagreeing with her husband's support for the university's discrimination against women. She taught at Newnham and Girton until 1916 and the university did recognise its own would be women graduates, with a formal decree, until over 30 years after she retired.\n\nMary was a friend of Newnham's principal Eleanor Sidgwick. In 1890 Marshall became a member of the Ladies Dining Society several of whom were associated with Newnham College. The society was started by Louise Creighton and Kathleen Lyttelton; other members of the society included Eleanor Sidgwick, the classicist Margaret Verrall, Newnham lecturers Mary Ward and Ellen Wordsworth Darwin, the mental health campaigner Ida Darwin, Baroness Eliza von Hügel, and the US socialites Caroline Jebb and Maud Darwin.\n\nHer husband Alfred became increasingly obstructive to the cause of women's education, believing that women had nothing useful to say. When Cambridge began to consider giving women degrees, he decided to object to the idea despite the views of friends and colleagues. Mary was nevertheless devoted to her husband, and an important unofficial collaborator in his own economic writings. Alfred's major theoretical work was \"Principles of Economics\"; he is mentioned as the only author, but Mary may have done quite as much work as he did on the book.\n\nAccording to James and Julianne Cicarelli, who wrote a book entitled \"Distinguished Women Economists\", she was listed by John Maynard Keynes in his \"Essays on Biography\". The Cicarellis say that “Keynes held her in the highest regard and considered her an intellectual and thinker every bit as significant to the historical development of economics as her husband or any of the other economist about whom he wrote.”\n\nAfter her husband died in 1924, Mary became Honorary Librarian of The Marshall Library of Economics at Cambridge, to which she donated her husband's collection of articles and books on economics. She continued to live in Balliol Croft until her death in 1944. She died in Cambridge on 19 March 1944 at the age of 93. Her ashes were scattered in the garden. Her husband is buried in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground.\n\nMary Marshall's reminiscences were published posthumously as \"What I Remember\" (1947).\n\nMary Marshall took Cambridge University’s final exams, which no woman had ever done before. She passed with honours, although unofficially because for many years women were not permitted Cambridge or Oxford degrees. In 1875 Mary became Cambridge’s first woman lecturer, teaching economics at Newnham College, supposedly being adored by her students.\n\nShortly after in 1879 Alfred and her both wrote \"The Economics of Industry\". This book was very popular with economics students of the time, but the publishing of the book was short lived. This was because her husband Alfred wrote the far more successful, \"The Principles of Economy\" in 1890, and then saw no reason to publish their other work anymore seeing it as inferior. Though she never expressed her feelings about Alfred doing this it obviously had an effect on her because she never again published a book of her own, she just aided Alfred in his writing from this point on. Due to this it is difficult to tell the true scale of Mary Marshall's work on economics.\n\nIn 1924, after Alfred's death, she used her own money to help to establish the Marshall Library of Economics at Cambridge. She worked there as a librarian until her doctors ordered her to stop, which she did reluctantly.\n\n"}

In 1971, a number of South Asian MSA members who had been involved in Islamic movements in their home countries developed an Islamic study circle (\"halaqa\"), in Montreal which became the predecessor of ICNA. The \"Sisters Wing\", its women's group, was established in 1979.\n\nIt is smaller and more conservative than the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), holding separate sessions at its national conventions for women. In 2002 it allowed a woman to address its annual convention for the first time. Its headquarters are in Jamaica, New York, and includes classrooms, a reading room, and a small mosque, and it has offices in Detroit, Michigan, and Oakville, Ontario.\n\nAccording to ICNA, its goal \"shall be to seek the pleasure of Allah through the struggle of \"Iqamat-ud-Deen\" establishment of the Islamic system of life as spelled out in the \"Qur'an\" and the \"Sunnah\" of Muhammad.\"\n\nICNA seeks to promote Islam and the Islamic way of life in the United States. They are active on the issues of War in Afghanistan and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Initially ICNA was composed of Muslim Americans of Indo-Pakistani descent who had split from ISNA.\n\nAccording to Hossein Nasr, ICNA has been influenced by the ideals of Abul A'la Maududi of Pakistan, and is structured similar to the Jamaat-e-Islami, which Mawdudi founded. However, it is a separate entity from Jamaat-e-Islami. John Esposito wrote in 2004 that it had links to \"Jamaat-e-Islami\".\n\nICNA strongly condemned the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt and immediately called for punishment to the fullest extext of the law for anyone who engages in terrorism. In 2011, ICNA welcomed President Barack Obama's counter-terrorism initiatives.\n\nThe \"Message International\" (formerly \"\"Tahreek\"\"), begun in 1989, is ICNA's bi-monthly publication.\n\nIts major \"Dawah\" activities include a toll-free number for non-Muslims (1-877-WhyIslam), and \"dawah\": field trips, distribution of Islamic literature, through mosques, by mail, through media, in prisons, campus support, flyers online, and through email. WhyIslam.org is an ICNA program.\n\nWhen the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy broke, ICNA condemned the depiction of any prophet, from Adam to Moses to Jesus to Mohammed.\n\nAs of 2002, a dozen mosques were affiliated with ICNA.\n\nICNA's annual convention is one of the largest gatherings of American Muslims in the United States, drawing thousands of people. The 33rd annual convention, co-sponsored by the Muslim American Society, was held at the Renaissance Waverly Atlanta Hotel in Georgia. The 2007 ICNA-MAS convention, the 32nd annual convention, was reportedly attended by over 13,000 people. The 38th Annual ICNA-MAS Convention, which was themed \"Islam: The Pursuit of Happiness\", was attended by a record 18,000 people at the Hartford Convention Center.\n\nThe conventions have been held in Baltimore since 2014 during Memorial Day Weekend. However, in 2017 it will be held during April due to Ramadan starting in the last week of May. \nICNA has participated in interfaith dialogue with the U.S. Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.\n\nIn January 2017, Javaid Siddiqi was elected ICNA president.\n\nWhy Islam?, headquartered in Somerset, New Jersey, is a community outreach project of the ICNA, with the objective of providing information about Islam, and debunking what it describes as popular misconceptions. Why Islam? was established in 2000. The project seeks to provide information about Islam, by dispelling popular stereotypes and common misconceptions about Islam and Muslims through various services and outreach activities. In an effort to promote peaceful co-existence and remove hatred in society through encouraging understanding, Why Islam? offers opportunities for dialogue and answers to people’s queries about Islam.\n\nIn July 2002 Anwar al-Awlaki, believed to be a senior talent recruiter and motivator for al-Qaeda who had contact with three of the 9/11 hijackers, the Fort Hood shooter, and the Christmas Day bombing suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, spoke at a joint ICNA/MAS convention in Baltimore with Siraj Wahhaj. ICNA says that until 2007, many American Muslims enthusiastically listened to lectures by al-Awlaki. It also says that at that time al-Awlaki was \"level headed\". After evidence was brought against al-Awlaki in 2010, the ICNA Shariah Council strongly denounced al-Awlaki's views, actions, and connections to terrorism, repudiating his ideology as a \"call of hate\" and called upon American Muslims to reject al-Awlaki's views.\n\nAccording to Yehudit Barsky, an expert on terrorism at the American Jewish Committee, the Islamic Circle of North America, \"is composed of members of Jamaat e-Islami, a Pakistani Islamic radical organization similar to the Muslim Brotherhood that helped to establish the Taliban\".\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) accused the ICNA of inviting extremist and anti-Semitic speakers to its conferences that serve as platforms for extremist views. ICNA responded to ADL's allegations by saying that its conferences have always been held under the objective of rejecting extremism. ICNA's statement also supported the defense of human rights for Jewish and Israeli people, but demanded the defense of human rights for Palestinians as well.\n\n"}

She is a Green Lantern successor of the supervillain Sinestro and predecessor of Sinestro's daughter Soranik Natu.\n\nKatma Tui first appeared in DC Comics' \"Green Lantern\" vol. 2 #30 (July 1964), and was created by writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane.\n\nKatma Tui hails from the planet Korugar, in the area of space designated Sector 1417 by the Guardians of the Universe, the extraterrestrials from the planet Oa who oversee and administer the Green Lantern Corps. Korugar was also the home planet of the renegade former Green Lantern Sinestro, who used his Green Lantern powers to enslave his planet, and rule over them as a tyrant, unbeknownst to his Guardian superiors. Tui eventually leads a rebellion against Sinestro, and even testifies against him before the Guardians. Sinestro is imprisoned in the antimatter universe, on the planet Qward. Green Lantern Tomar-Re nominates Tui as Sinestro's replacement as Green Lantern of Sector 1417, and Tui accepts. The people of Korugar, however, came to view the Green Lantern symbol as one of oppression and pain, and saw Tui as a monster for joining them. Tui is now known among her people as “Katma Tui the Lost”, as seen in \"\" #1 (November 2005).\n\nIn her first mission, which occurred during her probationary period as a Lantern, Tui and Korugaran scientist Imi Kann destroy a giant space amoeba creature that threatens Korugar. Tui and Kann fell in love, and Tui decides to leave the Corps. Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern of Earth, uses a ruse in order to persuade her not to.\n\nTui went on to become an exemplary Green Lantern on a number of adventures, including a prison breakout on the Guardians’ prison planet, her struggle against the telepathic influence of the alien Ffa’rzz the Mocker and her kidnapping by a group of terrorists who mistook her for Hal Jordan's love Carol Ferris. She is involved in the war against Krona, Nekron, the Weaponers of Qward, and the Anti-Green Lantern Corps. Tui successfully recruits Rot Lop Fan who has no concept of 'color', being sightless. Tui helps defeat the extra-dimensional entity known as Maaldor, who had cut off the Lanterns from the Main Battery on Oa that powered them. She is involved with the seminal event known as \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" and many subsequent conflicts with Sinestro.\n\nWhen Hal Jordan resigns from the Corps for Carol Ferris, Tui is infuriated, given that Jordan had persuaded her to give up Imi Kann for the Corps. When John Stewart initially turns down the offer of replacing Jordan as Green Lantern of Earth, Tui, projecting her anger towards Jordan upon Stewart, dismisses him as a coward, which provokes Stewart into changing his mind. Tui would eventually train Stewart and work closely with him on a number of missions. The two soon fall in love, and with the blessings of the Guardians they marry. During the first Green Lantern Corps story arc at the Citadel on Earth, Tui works with a large contingent of Lanterns who find themselves based in California. This grouping includes Kilowog, Ch'p and Arisia.\n\nKatma Tui is slain by the villain Star Sapphire. Katma, at the time unpowered, is sliced to death while in her kitchen. Star Sapphire did this simply to make a point to Hal Jordan.\n\nDuring the \"\" series, John Stewart becomes involved with a new society, various alien citizens placed together on one planet by an ex-Guardian, who had gone insane from loneliness. His efforts elevate him to become the first mortal Guardian of the Universe, known as The Master Builder. As his reward for this new level of awareness, John is reunited with his late wife, Katma Tui. However, tragedy strikes once again and Hal Jordan, possessed by Parallax, destroys both the Guardians and the Central Power Battery, robbing John of his newfound powers and his resurrected wife.\n\nThe Blue Lantern Saint Walker uses his blue power ring to calm John Stewart's rage from Red Lantern. By reading his psyche, the ring is able to discern that creating an image of Katma Tui would best serve this purpose. After being surrounded in an illusion of flying with his late-wife for several moments, Stewart emerges with the belief that he would be able to see Katma again.\n\nIn the \"Blackest Night\" crossover, black power rings are sent throughout the universe reanimating the bodies of the deceased. Katma Tui's name is among the first to be called out by a black ring, and she is shown reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps. Katma travels on the planet Xanshi to see John and tries to weaken John by claiming that he caused the planet's destruction. However, John, spurred on by Star Sapphire Fatality's words, says that he was not the cause of it all and successfully fights off the Black Lanterns. Black Lantern Katma is then destroyed by the combined efforts of John and Fatality. The two join their lights together to destroy the black ring, rendering Katma's corpse inert.\n\nSubsequently, in \"DC Rebirth\", when Hal Jordan is transported into the Emerald Space, where fallen Green Lantern officers go after being killed on duty, he meets Katma Tui. She asks about John Stewart, with Hal revealing that John still misses her.\n\nIn the \"\", she was part of the Lantern team sent to restrain the Green Lantern Batman.\n\n\n"}

Over 75% of the population of Puńsk is Lithuanian. It lies in the northeastern part of Poland, only from the border with Lithuania.\n\nPuńsk has belonged to Poland since 1920. With Lithuanian Culture House, Lithuanian high school and print house, Puńsk is the main centre of the Lithuanian minority in Poland. According to the census of 2011, it had a population of 1,336.\n\nThe oldest traces of human being in Puńsk territory date back to about 10 000 years BC. In the early medieval ages it was inhabited by Yatvingians and Sudovians. They did not have a country or a language that could have been written. In the 13th century, the Teutonic Knights exterminated them and only few of them survived. Nowadays only some castle hills (e.g. in Szurpiły), mounds (e.g. in Eglinė), cemeteries (e.g. in Szwajcaria), names of some villages (e.g. Zervynai, Krosna) and archaeological excavations remind us about their existence.\n\nLater on Sudovia became overgrown with forests. Lithuanian Grand Dukes hunted there. In the early 15th century the people from Merkinė and Punia started to colonize this territory again. They gave the name Punia to the lake, so the village was called Puńsk after it. It was one of the first settlements in this territory. At the same time the other ones were created, such us: Beržninkai (now Berżniki), Seinai (now Sejny) or Kreivėnai (now Krejwiany).\n\nIn 1597, the forester of Sejwy, Stanisław Zaliwski built the church in Puńsk, and the parish has been established here. Later on the chancellery of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania published the document of the king Sigismund the Old. It was written in it that the parish priest in Puńsk can be only a person who speaks Lithuanian. In 1647, the king Władysław IV Waza approved the civic rights of Puńsk according to the Magdeburg rights and gave it the coat of arms with St Peter’s image. At that time the parish of Puńsk belonged to the Diocese of Vilnius, and later (from 1795) to the bishopric of Wigry. There was a school and a hospital by the church.\n\nIn 1795, there lived 583 people in Puńsk and in 1827 more – 748. But in 1852 Puńsk lost its civic rights. In 1881, there lived 1,200 people in the whole parish. Then the parish of Puńsk was divided into three separate units: in Smolany, Becejły and Puńsk. In 1910, there were 74 villages with 7,044 people that belonged to the parish of Puńsk.\n\nFrom the 15th century until 1795, this land called Sudovia belonged to the Great Duchy of Lithuania. From 1815 it belonged to the zone of Russian authority. People of Puńsk area suffered from the tsar’s repressions. There were secret schools. The forbidden, illegal Lithuanian press and books were secretly transferred across the German-Russian border by the book-hawkers (knygnešiai). Povilas Matulevičius was the most famous book-hawker in the region.\n\nAfter World War I there were fights for Sudovia, namely the Suvalkai Region, between Lithuania and Poland, a part of the Polish-Lithuanian War.\n\nSimilar to the situation in other areas disputed by Poland and Lithuania, including the contested Vilnius region (polish name: Wileńszczyzna), a referendum which would determine which country the inhabitants of Puńsk wanted to belong to was not held. In April 1919 Puńsk and its territory became a part of Poland. A new border was established which has remained unchanged until now. Through 8 decades the language situation has changed to the advantage of Polish. As part of Poland, new local regulations were introduced by the government, and Lithuanians were repressed by them. During the interwar period, there were several active societies, for example St. Casimir's Society dealt with the matters of church, Rytas maintained schools, and Talka was a co-operative society. The vast majority of commerce and business belonged to Jews. They made up the greater part of Puńsk inhabitants at that time. Some extant old houses, the building of synagogue and a big cemetery nearby Puńsk remind of their former presence.\n\nAnti-Semitism was rampant, and many of the Jewish residents fled Polish rule. One such family was Rafalin. David Rafalin, a graduate of the Slobodka Yeshiva, became a rabbi in Cuba in 1929, then in 1933, he moved to Mexico, where he was a rabbi for 46 years. In 1931, most of the Jewish section of Puńsk was destroyed by a fire. In Yad Vashem's Central Database of Shoah (Holocaust) Victims, more than six dozen Jewish inhabitants of Puńsk are listed as being murdered during World War II. Some were killed in the town itself, while others were deported to camps and ghettos in Poland and neighboring Lithuania.\n\nDuring World War II, Lithuania belonged to the zone of the Soviet Union authority and Sudovia belonged to Germany. Later on the northern part of Sudovia was bought by Moscow for 7.5 million dollars. During World War II this territory was occupied by the Germans and incorporated into Eastern Prussia. The invaders started to introduce a new order. It was decided to make a clean sweep of undesirable people in Suwałki area. The unsuitable ones for germanization were killed and the favourable ones had been left to become assimilated. It was also decided to colonize this area and populate it with Germans, and resettle many indigenous Lithuanians to Lithuania, which was at those days occupied by the Russians. Germans did not want the territory formerly inhabited by Yatvingians, which was incorporated into Eastern Prussia, to be settled by the Lithuanians. According to the agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union on 10 January 1941, about 70% of people were expelled from the territory. Most of them returned home when the political situation changed.\n\nAfter World War II the territory of Puńsk became again a part of Poland, and remains so.\n\nWhen after war regime diminished Lithuanian social and cultural life in this region became more active again. In 1956, there was established LVKD (The Social and Cultural Association of Lithuanians). Its task was to weld Lithuanians who were scattered not only in Sudowia but all over Poland. Lithuanian schools and cultural centre were established. The ensembles of the Lithuanian Culture Centre in Puńsk perform in Poland and abroad. These are: choreographic ensemble Jotva (established in 1951), folk band Klumpė (1956), choir Dzūkija (1957) and barn theatre group. The important role in propagation of national awareness is played by the Publishing House and its periodical \"Aušra\". In 1993, LLB (Lithuanian Society in Poland) was established. One year later its offshoot - Lithuanian Youth Society was created. These organizations connect all of Lithuanians and represent their interests in and out of country.\n\nIn 1994, Poland and Lithuania signed an agreement about friendship and neighbourly cooperation. New possibilities have appeared in order to communicate with Poland.\n\n"}

Although part of the dominions of the Sultanate of Zanzibar, it was controlled by Britain in the late 19th century; it grew out of British commercial interests in the area in the 1880s and remained a protectorate until 1920 when it became the colony of Kenya, save for an independent country coastal strip that became the Kenya protectorate.\n\nEuropean missionaries began settling in the area from Mombasa to Mount Kilimanjaro in the 1840s, nominally under the protection of the Sultanate of Zanzibar. In 1886, the British government encouraged William Mackinnon, who already had an agreement with the Sultan and whose shipping company traded extensively in the African Great Lakes, to establish British influence in the region. He formed a British East Africa Association which led to the Imperial British East Africa Company being chartered in 1888 and given the original grant to administer the dependency. It administered about of coastline stretching from the River Jubba via Mombasa to German East Africa which were leased from the Sultan. The British \"sphere of influence\", agreed at the Berlin Conference of 1885, extended up the coast and inland across the future Kenya. Mombasa was the administrative centre at this time.\n\nHowever, the company began to fail, and on 1 July 1895, the British government proclaimed a protectorate, the administration being transferred to the Foreign Office. In 1902 administration was again transferred to the Colonial Office. In 1897 Lord Delamere, the pioneer of white settlement, arrived in the Kenya highlands, which was then part of the Protectorate. Lord Delamere was impressed by the agricultural possibilities of the area. In 1902, the boundaries of the Protectorate were extended to include what was previously the Eastern Province of Uganda. Also, in 1902, the East Africa Syndicate received a grant of to promote white settlement in the Highlands. Lord Delamere now commenced extensive farming operations, and in 1905, when a large number of new settlers arrived from England and South Africa, the Protectorate was transferred from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. The capital was shifted from Mombasa to Nairobi in 1905. A regular Government and Legislature were constituted by Order in Council in 1906. This constituted the administrator a governor and provided for legislative and executive councils. Lieutenant Colonel J. Hayes Sadler was the first governor and commander in chief. There were occasional troubles with local tribes but the country was opened up by the Government and the colonists with little bloodshed. After the First World War, more farmers arrived from England and South Africa, and by 1919 the European population was estimated at 9,000 settlers.\n\nOn 23 July 1920, the inland areas of the Protectorate were annexed as British dominions by Order in Council. That part of the former Protectorate was thereby constituted as the Colony of Kenya. The remaining coastal strip (with the exception of Witu), remained a Protectorate under an agreement with the Sultan of Zanzibar. That coastal strip, remaining under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Zanzibar, was constituted as the Protectorate of Kenya in 1920.\n\nAfter 1896, immigrants from India came to the area as moneylenders, traders, and artisans. Racial segregation was normalised, with the Europeans assigning the Highlands to themselves. Other restrictions included commercial and residential segregation in the towns, and restrictions on Indian immigration. Nevertheless, the Indians rapidly grew to outnumber the Europeans by more than two to one by 1919. India was a crown colony whose citizens enjoyed certain privileges but it was unclear whether the Ishmael Indians in the African Great Lakes were to be recognised as citizens of the British Empire or as a subject race.\n\nIn April 1902, the first application for land in British East Africa was made by the East Africa Syndicate – a company in which financiers belonging to the British South Africa Company were interested – which sought a grant of , and this was followed by other applications for considerable areas, including a large Jewish settlement. In 1902, a British soldier in East Africa described what happened in a single village:Every soul was either shot or bayoneted... We burned all the huts and razed the banana plantations to the ground.In April 1903, Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the American scout and then a Director of the East African Syndicate, sent an expedition consisting of John Weston Brooke, John Charles Blick, Mr. Bittlebank and Mr. Brown, to assess the mineral wealth of the region. The party, known as the \"Four B.'s\", travelled from Nairobi via Mount Elgon northwards to the western shores of Lake Rudolph, experiencing plenty of privations from want of water, and of the danger from encounters with the Maasai. With the arrival in 1903 of hundreds of prospective settlers, chiefly from South Africa, questions were raised concerning the preservation for the Maasai of their rights of pasturage, and the decision was made to entertain no more applications for large areas of land.\n\nIn the process of carrying out this policy of colonisation a dispute arose between Sir Charles Eliot, Commissioner of British East Africa, and Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secretary. The East Africa Syndicate had applied for and been pledged the lease of of land. Lansdowne, believing himself bound by the pledges, decided the applications should be approved. In a separate matter, two South African applicants who were each attempting to lease were declined by Lansdowne, and he refused Eliot permission to conclude the transactions. In view of this Eliot resigned his post, giving his reason in a public telegram to the Prime Minister, dated Mombasa, 21 June 1904, stating: \"Lord Lansdowne ordered me to refuse grants of land to certain private persons while giving a monopoly of land on unduly advantageous terms to the East Africa Syndicate. I have refused to execute these instructions, which I consider unjust and impolitic.\" Sir Donald William Stewart, the chief commissioner of Ashanti (Ghana), was announced as Sir Charles' successor on the day the telegram was sent.\n\nIn 1914 the British government banned cannabis (\"bhang\") in the Protectorate.\n\nThe territory had its own mail system during the 1890s.\n\n\n\n"}

He most often appears in Marvel's \"X-Men\" related comic books. He is a prominent United States Senator who began his career on an anti-mutant platform and tended to be an antagonist to the X-Men team. But towards the later days of his career, he began to change his views on mutants as a whole.\n\nThe character was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne and makes his first appearance in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #135 (July 1980).\n\nSenator Robert Kelly was first seen at a social gathering hosted by the Hellfire Club, where an illusion projected by the mutant villain Mastermind caused him to believe he had witnessed the X-Man Cyclops firing randomly into a crowd. He was the primary backer of the Mutant Control Act and Project Wideawake, a government program aimed at creating updated Sentinel robots that would help track down and, if necessary, detain or kill violent mutants.\n\nHe played a central role in the \"Days of Future Past\" storyline. The entire plot revolved around the X-Men stopping Mystique and her Brotherhood of Mutants from assassinating Senator Kelly and thus inadvertently causing a dystopian future where mutants and other heroes were hunted down by the Sentinels and nearly totally eliminated.\n\nSenator Kelly was later married to Sharon, a former maid who worked in the Hellfire Club. Kelly, in a meeting with Sebastian Shaw, was shocked when his wife walked in wearing her old, servant garb as a bit of fun. She was genuinely apologetic, saying she would not have done such a thing if it hadn't been just him and Shaw. Sharon has killed the next issue, in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #247 (August 1989), shot by the mutant-hunting robot known as Master Mold during a battle between Master Mold and Rogue. This further incited Robert's stance against mutantkind.\n\nKelly remained an active anti-mutant activist in the comics through the 1990s but slowly became more open-minded and tolerant towards the mutant population, promising the X-Men he would work for the rights of mutants during the early 2000s. After his life was saved by the mutant Pyro in an attack (this was when Pyro was infected with the Legacy Virus) from his old teammate Post, Kelly vowed to reconsider his standing on mutants and work towards improving human/mutant relations. Despite being guarded by the X-Man Cable, he was not long afterward assassinated at a college rally (where he was speaking at the time) by the anti-mutant activist Alan Lewis who felt that Senator Kelly betrayed their anti-mutant cause. He died in Cable's arms after Cable had been too occupied helping Jean Grey save Charles Xavier on the astral plane to realize the danger to Kelly before it was too late. With his dying breaths, he pleaded for Nathan not to give up on his dream. His failure to protect the reformed Senator Kelly, coupled with his devastating loss of Moira MacTaggert who was murdered by Mystique, led Cable to leave the X-Men not long afterward.\n\nA prison for mutant criminals called the Box was also known as the Robert Kelly Correction Facility where it was named in honor of him.\n\nThe name of the character was chosen by Chris Claremont, in honor of his Bard College professor, the poet Robert Kelly. The latter has confirmed the connection between the two names in interviews among his students.\n\nIn the \"Age of Apocalypse\", Robert Kelly was an activist for mutant-human peace who is eventually elected President of the United States. He named Magneto as Director of Mutant Affairs and enlisted the aid of the X-Men in the reconstruction of the broken country.\n\nIn the \"X-Men Noir\" reality, Robert Kelly was a Republican Senator of New York who strongly defended the controversial U.S. extraterritorial prison Genosha Bay. Kelly believed through eugenics that it is necessary for containing criminals who are more exceptionally dangerous and from \"infecting\" the public with their criminal ways. However, in reality, Kelly's true purpose of keeping Genosha Bay was because it was the proving grounds in recruiting the next generation of ideal soldiers and government operatives.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Wars\" storyline, a version of Robert Kelly existed as the appointed Baron of the Battleworld domain known as Westchester. Robert Kelly survived an assassination attempt by the Shadow King whom possessed Cassandra Nova (revealed to be a clone of Charles Xavier, created by Apocalypse) and despite being a merely \"human\" and remaining publicly favorable to the X-Men, Baron Kelly was secretly one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse along with Bastion, Mystique, and Exodus. He was last seen meeting with Apocalypse to plan the future for Westchester.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Delta Xi Phi is one of the founding members of the National Multicultural Greek Council (NMGC).\n\nDelta Xi Phi is based on five pillars: the Advancement of Women through Higher Education, Community Service, Increasing Multicultural Awareness, Sisterhood, and Friendship.\n\nDelta Xi Phi sorority was founded on April 20, 1994 on the University of Illinois at Urbana – Champaign (UIUC) campus, by fifteen young women. They recognized a need for an organization that appreciated the different cultures present on their college campuses. Multicultural awareness, as well as community service, the empowerment of women in higher education, friendship and sisterhood were also important aspects of Delta Xi Phi.\n\nIn the spring of 1992, two different groups of women who were seeking to establish a new sorority at UIUC learned of each other's intentions. The two groups organized a meeting where they discussed their goals and aspirations. They surprisingly overlapped and so these women unanimously decided to work together toward their common goal and the two groups merged. They decided to temporarily call themselves \"Women for the Advancement of a Multicultural Society\" (WAMS). Several sororities on other college campuses were contacted with the intention of establishing a chapter at the University of Illinois campus. However, none of those had everything that was wanted by WAMS.\n\nFinally, on April 20, 1993, after almost a year of searching for a sorority and much frustration, the women of WAMS made a decision to stop looking for other sororities and to commence their quest of founding their own. Three women from WAMS were designated pledge educators and helped the other twelve women's dream of founding a sorority become a reality. They went through a year-long pledging process during which they developed a strong bond of sisterhood.\n\nThe foundation of their sorority began with meetings where they discussed and voted upon its letters, colors, mascot, flower, and stone. On April 20, 1994 the members of WAMS were no longer just the women of WAMS; they were to be forever known as the founding mothers of Delta Xi Phi Multicultural Sorority. On February 6, 1998, Delta Xi Phi Sorority became an incorporated entity.\n\nThe following is a list of the fifteen original founders known as \"Diamantes\".\n\n\nOver the years, DXP has grown with six chapters and 17 associate chapters from coast to coast.\n\n(*) Inactive\n\nDelta Xi Phi's official interest groups are known as \"WAMS\" – Women for the Advancement of a Multicultural Society.\n\n"}

It originally aired as an \"ABC Movie of the Week\" on January 23, 1974.\n\nSam Farragut is a sociopathic business executive in Southern California who forces a team of advertising agency employees, Warren Summerfield, Paul McIlvain, Terry Maxon to embark on a dangerous dirtbike trip to the Baja California desert in order to compete for his business.\n\nWarren Summerfield is a suicidal middle-aged ad executive who has been fired from the agency; the straightlaced Paul McIlvain is inattentive to his wife, and brash art designer, Maxon, feels suddenly trapped after his girlfriend announces she is pregnant. There are numerous long sequences of motorcycle riding on desert backroads.\n\nSummerfield has been having an affair with McIlvian's wife. He has not told his wife that he was fired and is simply serving out his tenure at the agency while looking for a new position. His wife is actually aware of the affair.\n\nFarragut convinces the ad men to make the motorcycle journey on the pretext of looking for a location to shoot a commercial.

They had four children who lived to adulthood: Isa Garteray Urquhart Glenn (18741951), a novelist and contemporary of Ellen Glasgow; Garrard Glenn (18781949), noted attorney in New York City and subsequently professor of law at The University of Virginia; Helen Mildred Lewis Glenn (18851971), who married Theodore Gordon Ellyson of Richmond, Virginia, the first Naval aviator; and William Louis Glenn (1887–1950), an attorney in New York City.\n\nGlenn practiced law in Atlanta, served as Atlanta's mayor, and died less than a decade later. Money from his estate was used to develop the Glenn Building at Spring St and Marietta which was commissioned by the George Fuller Company to coincide with the Spring Street Viaduct which they were building at the time.

It gained particular notoriety for a mob attack and murder of an innocent man, Alain de Moneys, at the time of the Franco-Prussian War, in mid-August 1870.\n\nOn 16 August 1870, France was losing the war against Prussia. Within three weeks, Emperor Napoleon III would be captured by the enemy and his regime overthrown by a self-proclaimed Government for National Defence.\n\nRural France, which had largely been faithful to Napoleon I and welcomed his nephew, was tense. Many rural residents were illiterate and depended upon news of the war from educated, often noble residents, which they resented.\n\nDuring a fair at Hautefaye, matters turned ugly when an aristocratic cousin of a young nobleman named Alain de Monéys reported the war was not going well. Many villagers had been drinking and received the news poorly. They attacked the cousin, the Vicomte Camille Maillard Lafaye, son of the mayor of the nearby town of Beaussac. Frightened, the viscount and his party fled. In an alcohol-fueled patriotic fervor, villagers wielding pitchforks and cudgels turned their attention on young Alain.\n\nThey accused him of being a Prussian plant, a spy, and of financing Prussia in the war against France. They claimed he betrayed the emperor and nation. Both claims were in fact false, as Monéys was not a Republican and his patriotism was spotless, but a crowd gathered around him. The parish priest tried to calm the mob by offering drinks to divert their attention but, however well-meaning the effort may have been, it probably helped get the crowd even more intoxicated than they already were and more dangerous. The mayor, unable to show leadership in the face of drunken excitement, reportedly said \"Eat him if you want\".\n\nFor two hours, the mob tortured and battered Alain de Monéys. They nailed horseshoes to his feet and burst one of his eyeballs. The crowd finally burnt him in the village square (or a nearby lake bed), likely while still alive. It is alleged that those who took part in the killing collected fat dripping from his burning body onto bread, eating the resulting \"tartines\". (The last statement has not been proved historical).\n\nSome 600 festival attendees were implicated in the affair. On 19 August 1870, gendarmes arrested fifty people ranging in age from age 14 through 60.\n\nOn 18 September 1870, twenty-one defendants were informed of charges against them.\n\nDuring 13–21 December 1870, perpetrators were brought to trial in the town of Périgueux. Nineteen were convicted, four sentenced to death. Judge Brochon, from the Bourdeaux Court of Appeals, presided over the Dordogne Criminal Court in this instance. Altogether, four individuals were judged to have primary culpability and sentenced to death, while another received a sentence of life imprisonment. Others received sentences ranging from six to eight years imprisonment with hard labour for their role in the atrocity. Another group was sentenced to a single year of imprisonment. One teenager, then aged fourteen years of age, was sentenced to six years in a reformatory, while a small child was acquitted.\n\nOn 6 February 1871, the four participants judged most complicit for the murder of Monéys were guillotined in the Hautefaye village square.\n\nIn 1953, Lavaud Noemie, the last direct witness of the Hautefaye Affair, died at 92 years of age.\n\nOn 16 August 1970, a century after the tragedy and at the initiative of one of the villagers, the Hautefaye church held a \"Mass of forgiveness\" in the presence of descendants of the family of Alain of Monéys and those of his killers.\n\nJean Teule has since written an historical novel on the subject, \"Eat Him if You Like\" (2009: English Translation: 2011).\n\n\n"}

It is produced by WNYC in New York City. \"OTM\" is first broadcast on Friday evening over WNYC's FM service and is syndicated nationwide to more than 400 other public radio outlets. The program is available by audio stream, MP3 download, and podcast. OTM also publishes a weekly newsletter featuring news on current and past projects as well as relevant links from around the web.\n\nAs defined by co-host Garfield, \"On the Media\" covers \"...anything that reaches a large audience—either electronically or otherwise... Plus, throw into that anything that covers First Amendment issues; anything that has to do with freedom of speech, privacy, is also in our portfolio\". The show explores how the media are changing, and their effects on America and the world. Many stories are centered on events of the previous week and how they were covered in the news. These often consist of interviews with reporters about the dilemmas they face in covering controversial issues.\n\nStories regularly cover such subjects as the use of video news releases, net neutrality, digital broadcast flags, media consolidation, censorship, freedom of the press, the influence of 24-hour cable news television coverage, media oppression, and how the media are changing with technology.\n\nThe show also addresses questions about how the media is influenced or spun by politicians, corporations, and interest groups with the intent to shape public opinion. This includes an \"OTM\" feature that covers the media's use of terminologies that may engender biased points of view, and the use of hot-button issues and code words, such as \"Michael Moore\", \"torture\", \"evangelical\", and \"islamofascist\".\n\nThe show also runs a series entitled \"Breaking News Consumer's Handbook\", which offers lists of advice on how to properly report or react to different types of recent events in the news.\n\n\"On the Media\" first aired February 7, 1993 on WNYC as a local call-in show, first hosted by Brian Lehrer and later, by Alex S. Jones. During its first episodes it was called \"Inside Media\", but the title was changed to avoid confusion with a same-named trade publication. In 1997 the show went national in a magazine-style format, hosted by WNYC host Brian Lehrer. During this period, this show was hampered by Lehrer being stretched thin, due to commitments from his own daily show, inexperienced producers, and the lack of an editor. \n\nIn late 2000, Gladstone was brought in by WNYC's director of programming to rethink and relaunch the show. The newly formatted \"OTM\" debuted in January 2001, co-hosted by Gladstone and Bob Garfield. \n\nMore than 400 public radio stations currently broadcast the show weekly. Formerly distributed nationally by NPR, WNYC began distributing the show in-house in 2015.\n\n\"On the Media\" won a 2004 Peabody Award for excellence. The judges wrote that \"\"On the Media\" reminds us that the messenger is always part of the message and must be examined as such\". In addition, the show has won Edward R. Murrow Awards for feature reporting and investigative reporting, the National Press Club's Arthur Rowse Award for Press Criticism, and the Bart Richards Award for Media Criticism in both 2012 and 2013. In 2016, \"On the Media\" was awarded the Silver Gavel for its episode \"Bench Press\". In 2017, producer Meara Sharma was awarded a Gracie Award for her production of the episode \"Kidnapped\", a special hour on how people around the world get news from Syria.\n\n"}

It is situated about 250 yards to the south of junction 6 of the inner ring road. The station is on the Birmingham loop of the West Coast Main Line (WCML), and is at the centre of a junction where the lines to Nuneaton, and to Leamington converge.\n\nCoventry station has regular services between London Euston and Birmingham New Street on the WCML. Other services are extended to/from Wolverhampton, Shrewsbury, Preston, Glasgow and Edinburgh Waverley. There are also long distance CrossCountry services to Manchester to the north, and Oxford and Bournemouth to the south. Local services also operate between Coventry-Nuneaton, Northampton and Leamington Spa.\n\nThe station has the PlusBus scheme where train and bus tickets can be bought together at a saving.\n\nThe original station was built in 1838 as part of the London and Birmingham Railway and could be entered from Warwick Road, where two flights of stairs took the passengers down to the platform. Within two years it had been replaced, with a new larger station, a few hundred feet nearer to Rugby, this time, accessed via Eaton Road. In the late 19th century the Coventry tram network extended to the station at Eaton Road. The original station remained in service as the station masters offices, until the station was redeveloped in the early 1960s by the London Midland Region of British Railways.\n\nThe new 1840 station saw a significant number of modifications and extensions over the years, there was an engine shed, water column and turntable, in its later days an inclined walkway from the platform directly to Warwick Road for summer excursions, and a parcel depot formed from old carriages. However, the station was constrained by bridges at either end of the station, Stoney Road Bridge to the south, and Warwick Road bridge to the north. The bridges effectively restricted the station to two lines, and prevented the platforms from being extended.\n\nIn the early 1960s both bridges were widened, and the old station finally demolished and re-built, this time with room for four platforms instead of two. At the time it was demolished in 1960, some parts of the old station were 120 years old. The station comprises a two-storey height booking hall with reinforced concrete frame, linked across an adjoining platform by a bridge to an island platform and a single sided platform. It was built to the designs of W R Headley, Regional Architect of the London Midland Region of British Railways and Derrick Shorten, the project architect. It was formally reopened on 1 May 1962. In 1995 it became a Grade II listed building.\n\nThe new station featured a new parcel depot, used to manage the large number of mail order catalogue packages coming into Coventry at the time. The depot was serviced by its own platforms from the Rugby end. The depot has now been replaced by a multi-storey car park, although some of the platforms and an electrification gantry remain.\n\nA £91 million redevelopment of the station is proposed to commence in 2019. From the mid-2020s Coventry station is also planned to be served by the Coventry Very Light Rail system.\n\nThe London and Birmingham Railway opened a small motive power depot at the west end of the station in 1838. This was replaced by a larger depot in the fork between the Leamington and Rugby lines, in 1866. This was enlarged in 1897 and rebuilt in 1957 but closed 17 November 1958 and was demolished. Locomotives were then serviced at the former Great Western Railway depot at Leamington Spa.\n\nThe station is served by Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry and West Midlands Trains. In the past, it has also been served by Silverlink, but these routes were transferred to Central Trains in 2004. Central Trains and Virgin CrossCountry services were respectively transferred to London Midland and CrossCountry in 2007.\n\nThere is a small yard at the Birmingham end of the station, in front of the shopping centre that was once part of Coventry's yard, that is used by London Midland for the stabling of electric traction units, no heavy work is carried out at Coventry as that is done at either Soho TMD (for Class 323s) or Northampton Siemens depot (Class 350s). All diesel units are stabled at Tyseley TMD where they are cleaned, maintained and refuelled. These units are only used on the local service to Nuneaton.\n\nUntil 2004, Coventry had a direct service to Nottingham via Leicester, but this was discontinued because Network Rail took away the ability for trains coming from Coventry to cross to the Leicester line at Nuneaton.\n\n, the off-peak day time service pattern is: \n\nIn addition to the usual ticket office, the station has a travel centre for information, tickets for advance travel, ferry services, for rail passes, and other services.\n"}

He attended the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens, where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society and earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1861 in engineering.\n\nAt the beginning of the Civil War Hemphill joined the Confederate Army, rising to the rank of colonel. He suffered a serious head wound at the Battle of Gettysburg. After the war, he moved to Atlanta in 1867, to teach. Within one year, Hemphill accepted an offer from Carey Wentworth Styles, to become the business manager and co-owner in a new joint venture with Styles and James Anderson. They had just purchased a small newspaper, the \"Atlanta Daily Opinion\" which they renamed. \"The Constitution\" was first published under that name on June 16, 1868. Styles quickly fell into financial difficulty, when he was unable to sell his interests in a struggling Albany, Georgia newspaper, \"The Albany News\". With his inability to raise capital, Styles could not pay for his purchase of \"The Constitution\". His ownership in the newspaper was assumed by Anderson and Hemphill. Hemphill, who became Anderson's son-in-law in the subsequent six months was placed in full charge of the Atlanta publication. Hemphill continued in his position as business manager of the paper until 1901. Hemphill's business acumen helped get the fledgling newspaper on sound financial footing. In active competition with other Atlanta newspapers, Hemphill hired special trains (one engine and car) to deliver newspapers to the Macon marketplace. In 1870 Anderson sold his one half interest in the paper to Col. E. Y. Clarke. In 1876 Clarke sold his half interest in the paper to Evan Howell. Howell's family would come to own \"The Atlanta Constitution\" from 1902 to 1950. \n\nIn 1883, Hemphill was one of a group of investors who incorporated the Fulton County Street Railroad (horse cars), which was later electrified, and became famous for its Nine-Mile Circle route to what is now Virginia-Highland.\n\nHemphill was first elected to the position of (Atlanta) city councilman-at-large in 1887, the same year he began an unsuccessful banking career. The next few years he served as president of the board of education and in 1889 added alderman duties.\n\nWhile still in control of the Constitution in 1890 he defeated a Black mayoral candidate known now only as \"McKinley\", by 1,773 votes, and took office the next year.\n\nDuring his tenure the first building of what became Grady Memorial Hospital was built and a fresh-water pumping station was established on the Chattahoochee River replacing the need for various wells and cisterns (for fires). Part of the purchased for the associated reservoir included a newly built street named in his honorHemphill Ave.\n\nAfter leaving office, Hemphill read about the Cotton Palace in Waco, Texas, and suggested that Atlanta could stimulate growth by hosting what would become the Cotton States and International Exposition of 1895. He later served as vice president and director of the Exposition.\n\nHemphill died suddenly on August 17, 1902, from injuries sustained in a fall. He is buried at Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta.\n\n"}

It is regionally popular, specifically in Maryland, the Mid-Atlantic States, the Southern States, and parts of New England and the Gulf Coast.\n\nOld Bay Seasoning is named after the Old Bay Line, a passenger ship line that plied the waters of the Chesapeake Bay from Baltimore to Norfolk, Virginia, in the early 1900s. In 1939, a Jewish-German immigrant named Gustav Brunn started the Baltimore Spice Company. There, in his new company on Market Place in downtown Baltimore, and having fled the Bavarian town of Bastheim, Germany in 1937 at the outset of the second World War with only a small spice grinder, Brunn created what would later become known to the world as Old Bay seasoning. He produced the \"Delicious Brand Shrimp and Crab Seasoning\", as he first named it, to service the needs and tastes of the nearby seafood market. A catchier name was later suggested and Old Bay seasoning was born.\n\nFor many years, the Baltimore Spice Company produced Old Bay until the legal rights to the seasoning brand were purchased by McCormick & Co in 1990 and the rights to the Baltimore Spice Company itself were purchased by the Fuchs Group, a German spice company. McCormick continued to offer Old Bay in the classic yellow can. Gustav Brunn had worked for McCormick for a short time before starting his own spice business.\n\nMcCormick has a number of other products under the Old Bay banner, including seasoning packets for crab cakes, salmon patties and tuna, tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, and seafood batter mix. They also make other seasoning blends that mix Old Bay seasoning with garlic, lemon, brown sugar, herbs and blackened seasonings. McCormick has offered a lower-sodium version of Old Bay Seasoning.\n\nIn 2017, McCormick changed the packaging from metal cans to plastic containers in an effort to reduce the packaging costs.\n\nThe seasoning is chiefly used to season crab and shrimp. It is also used in various clam chowder and oyster stew recipes. The seasoning is also used as a topping on popcorn, salads, eggs, fried chicken, french fries, tater tots, corn on the cob, boiled peanuts, dips, chipped beef, baked potatoes, potato salad, potato chips, and guacamole. Several movie theaters in the Chesapeake region offer it in the condiment section.\n\nPotato chip manufacturer Utz created the original \"Crab Chip\" based on a similar mix of spices. The popular potato chip variety was later copied and marketed by Herr's Snacks (however, Herr's uses Old Bay seasoning and it is sold as \"Herr's Old Bay Chips\"). Lay's introduced its own Old Bay-seasoned \"Chesapeake Bay Crab Spice\" flavored chips in 2018.\n\nEarly in its history, the Subway sandwich shop used Old Bay when mixing their seafood and crab salad. Many local Subway shops still have Old Bay for use on sandwiches.\n\nOld Bay is also occasionally used around the Chesapeake Bay region as an ingredient in Bloody Marys, and even in places as far south as The Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Florida. Some bars in the Baltimore region also often sell what is known as a 'Crabby Bo', which is National Bohemian beer where the lip of the glass or mug that is being used is moistened and dipped into a container of Old Bay seasoning. In 2014, the Maryland-based brewery Flying Dog created an Old Bay-inspired summer ale named Dead Rise to celebrate the seasoning's 75th anniversary.\n\n"}

McKiernan\n\nDennis Lester McKiernan (born April 4, 1932) is an American writer best known for his high fantasy \"The Iron Tower\". His genres include high fantasy (set in various fictitious worlds), science fiction, horror fiction, and crime fiction. His primary setting, Mithgar, was originally used to re-tell the plot points of J R R Tolkien's Middle Earth books, although the characters usually have different names.\n\nMcKiernan was born in Moberly, Missouri, where he lived until he served the U.S. Air Force for four years, stationed within US territory during the Korean War. After military service, he attended the University of Missouri and received a BS in electrical engineering in 1958 and an MS in the same field from Duke University in 1964. He worked as an engineer at AT&T, initially at Western Electric but soon at Bell Laboratories, from 1958 until 1989. In 1989, after early retirement from engineering, McKiernan began writing on a full-time basis.\n\nIn 1977, while riding his motorcycle, McKiernan was hit by a car that had crossed the center-line, and he was confined to a bed, first in traction and then in a hip spica cast, for many months. During his recuperation, he began a sequel to J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". The publisher Doubleday showed an interest in his work and tried to obtain authorization from Tolkien's estate but was denied. Doubleday then asked McKiernan to rewrite his story, placing the characters in a different fictitious world, and also to write a prequel supporting it. The prequel, of necessity, resembles \"The Lord of the Rings\"; the decision of Doubleday to issue the work as a trilogy increased that resemblance; and some critics have seen McKiernan as simply imitating Tolkien's epic work. McKiernan has subsequently developed stories in the series that followed along a story line different from those that plausibly could have been taken by Tolkien.\n\nMcKiernan's Faery Series expands tales drawn from Andrew Lang's Fairy Books, additionally tying the selected tales together with a larger plot.\n\nMcKiernan currently lives in Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). WYPX-TV's offices are located on Charles Boulevard in Guilderland, and its transmitter is located in the Helderberg Escarpment in New Scotland. The station also serves as the \"de facto\" Ion outlet for the Mohawk Valley (including Utica).\n\nThe station signed on the air in 1987 as an independent station under the call letters WOCD. It was owned by Amsterdam Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Coit Services of San Francisco, and was leased to Christian Community Television (CCT) of Schenectady, New York. CCT faced financial troubles from the outset and they soon fell behind on their payments, so Amsterdam Broadcasting reassumed control of the station. The station went dormant in 1989, but in 1991, Coit struck a deal to sell the station to Tennessee TV executive Wade Griffith for $1.8 million. Griffith would have relaunched the station as WNSI, but the deal fell through, and WOCD was sold to Cornerstone Television, a religious broadcaster, for $375,000 in 1992. The second incarnation of WOCD had problems getting cable carriage in much of the market which combined with the looming conversion to digital television led the station to be sold again.\n\nIn 1997, Paxson Communications bought WOCD from Cornerstone, moved the station's offices from Scotia, New York to Guilderland, and made the station an outlet for the Infomall Television Network (inTV). The call sign was changed to WYPX on January 13, 1998; however, the new calls confused some people as there was a radio station with a similar call sign in the Albany market. WYPX became a charter station for the Pax TV network when it launched on August 31, 1998. WYPX also added a secondary affiliation with UPN on October 5, 1998, airing the network's programming in late night hours following Pax's primetime programming. WVBG-LP (channel 25), a low-power station in Albany, also joined UPN as a primary affiliate the same day; the affiliation deal with WYPX was made before the network agreed to affiliate with WVBG (as Albany had no UPN affiliate at the time, though area cable systems imported WSBK-TV from Boston). WYPX retained its secondary UPN affiliation despite WVBG's affiliation; however, UPN programming disappeared from channel 55 in 1999.\n\nIn 2001, WYPX entered into a joint sales agreement with Hubbard Broadcasting, owner of NBC affiliate WNYT (channel 13); under this arrangement, WNYT sold advertising time on WYPX, while WYPX aired replays of WNYT's news and public affairs programming. Paxson terminated all joint sales agreements involving its stations in June 2005 as part of its relaunch of Pax TV as i: Independent Television.\n\nWYPX-DT signed on the air on UHF channel 50 and broadcasts at 450 kW from the same transmitter site in early 2005. WYPX-TV requested permission from the FCC to shut down their analog signal on channel 55 so that the bandwidth could be used for Qualcomm's MediaFLO service. Qualcomm had made deals with other stations on channel 55, including WLNY of Riverhead, New York, to shut down analog so that they could launch their new multimedia offering on April 12, 2007. It was granted permission by the FCC to shut down its analog broadcast, surrender its analog license, and operate as a digital-only station on channel 50 on September 6, 2007. The station shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 55, on September 28, 2007. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 50. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 55, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\n"}

Grant and Rachel Ward. The title is a pun and can be literally taken as \"How to Get a \"Head\" in Advertising\".\n\nThe film is a farce about a mentally unstable advertising executive, Denis Dimbleby Bagley (played by Grant), who suffers a nervous breakdown while making an advert for pimple cream. Ward plays his long-suffering but sympathetic wife. Richard Wilson plays John Bristol, Bagley's boss.\n\nBagley has a crisis of conscience about the ethics of advertising, which leads to mania. He then develops a boil on his right shoulder that comes to life with a face and voice. The voice of the boil, although uncredited, is that of Bruce Robinson. The boil takes a cynical and unscrupulous view of the advertising profession in contrast to Bagley's new-found ethical concerns. Eventually, Bagley decides to have the boil removed in hospital but moments before he is taken into the operating room, the boil quickly grows into a replica of Bagley's head (only with a moustache) and covers Bagley's original head, asking doctors to lance it, which is done since nobody has noticed the switch from left to right nor the new moustache. Bagley, now with the boil head, moustache, and personality (the movie's third personification from Grant after the stressed executive and the raving lunatic) returns home to celebrate his wedding anniversary, with the original head merely resembling a boil on his left shoulder. The \"boil\" eventually withers but doesn't die, yet Bagley resumes his advertising career rejuvenated and ruthless, although without his wife, who decides to leave his new cruel persona.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 60% based on reviews from 15 critics.\n\nIn an interview with Jimmy Kimmel in 2019, Richard E. Grant said that Jim Carrey called him a genius for his work in the film.\n\n"}
{"id": "1968113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968113", "title": "Qemant people", "text": "Qemant people\n\nThe Qemant () are a small ethnic group in Northwestern Ethiopia (Gondar). They are related to the Agaw people in Ethiopia. The Qemant people traditionally practiced an early Hebraic religion, however most members of the Qemant are followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Despite their historic relationship, they should not be confused with the Beta Israel.\n\nThe ethnicity's population is reported to be 172,000, according to the 1994 national census; the latest available national census, the one performed in 2007, does not list them as a separate group. However, only 1,625 people still speak Qimant, and it is considered endangered, as most children speak Amharic; likewise, adherence to the traditional religion has dropped substantially, as most of the population has converted to Christianity. Converts often consider themselves to have become Amhara. Historically, there was a constant effort to assimilate the Qemant people to the Amhara people. This resulted in the alarming decrease of the number of people who speak the Qemant language. In the 2007 Ethiopian Census, the Qemant people were not counted as a separate ethnic group. This is one of the most extreme examples of the efforts to assimilate the Qemant to the Amhara, and thus deny the ethnic identity of the Qemant people.\n\nThe Qemant live along an axis stretching from Ayikel in Chilga woreda to Kirakir and north to Lake Tana in the woredas of Lay Armachiho. Most remaining speakers of the language are near Ayikel, about west of Gondar. They are mainly farmers.\n\nThe Qemant are divided into two patrilineal moieties, the Keber and the Yetanti; the Keber is higher in rank. A traditional Qemant can only marry a member of the other moiety, so, while the moieties are exogamous, Qemant society as a whole is endogamous.\n\nThe Qemant traditionally practiced a religion which is often described as \"Hebraic\" . According to the American anthropologist Frederic C. Gamst, their \"Hebraism is an ancient form and unaffected by Hebraic change of the past two millennia\". A recent sociolinguistic survey notes that the Qemant religion is in a very precarious situation since very few people still adhere to it due to rapid assimilation. According to this study, the ratio of those who follow the Qemant religion vs. those who are baptized and converted to Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity is about 1% vs. 99%.\n\nTheir religious observances include a literal reading of the 11th chapter of Leviticus (\"see Kashrut\"). As with mainstream Judaism, even permitted animals can only be consumed if they are properly slaughtered (\"see Shechita\"). Their practices include continued animal sacrifices, and the tending of sacred groves (called \"degegna\").\nWorship is conducted outdoors, usually at a site near a sacred tree (called \"qole\"), wrapped in variously-colored strips of cloth. This appears to be a survival of a biblical tradition:\nand\nHowever, due to their dislike to being observed by the increasingly pervasive Christians, they eventually constructed a prayer-hall at Chelga.\nThe Sabbath is observed on Saturday, when it is forbidden to light a fire. The extent as to which they observe other prohibitions often found in Judaism is unclear.\n\nThe Qemant call their Deity \"Adara\" (God) or \"Yeadara\" (My God) or \"Mezgana\", which might to be a proper name. He is described as omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, and anthropomorphic. He is approachable directly or through \"qedus\" which are angels or culture heroes.\n\nThe highest political and religious leader among the Qemant is their High Priest, called the \"Wember\" (also transliterated \"Womber\" and \"Wambar\"), an Amharic term meaning \"seat.\" There were formerly two superior wambars, at Karkar and at Chelga, with the first being senior, and a varying number of subordinate wambars in other parts of Qemantland. All wambars are chosen from certain lineages in the Keber moiety. The last wambar of Karkar died in 1955, and since then the only wambar has been Mulunah Marsha, Wambar of Chelga (born 1935). Each wambar chose (from the Keber moiety) one or more delegates with the title of \"afaliq\" to represent him in judicial matters. These men traveled the countryside, settling disputes, seeing that the laws were obeyed, and punishing wrongdoing, usually with a fine. Each wambar also chose two stewards with different titles, one from each moiety, who served different elements of the sacred meals.\n\nThere are two orders of priesthood, the \"kamazana\", the higher, of the Keber moiety, and the \"abayegariya\", the lower, of the Yetanti moiety. Each Qemant locality has at least one of each; they must work together to conduct the traditional sacrifices and other religious ceremonies. When offering a sacrifice, the abayegaria holds the legs of the victim and the kamazana wields the knife. The priests also have a subordinate judicial function.\n\nThe origins of the Qemant are unknown due to lack of a written history.\n\nAccording to the early 19th century missionary Samuel Gobat, their Amharic-speaking neighbors considered the Qemant \"boudas\", or sorcerers, along with \"the Falashas or Jews (Beta Israel), most Mussulamns (Muslims), and some Christians.\" Gobat knew little more about this \"small Pagan people inhabiting the mountains in the vicinity of Gondar.\"\n\n\n\n) \"The Qemant.

{"id": "1968115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968115", "title": "Proposition 2½", "text": "Proposition 2½\n\nProposition 2½ () is a Massachusetts statute that limits property tax assessments and, secondarily, automobile excise tax levies by Massachusetts municipalities. The name of the initiative refers to the 2.5% ceiling on total property taxes annually as well as the 2.5% limit on property tax increases. It was passed by ballot measure, specifically called an initiative petition within Massachusetts state law for any form of referendum voting, in 1980 and went into effect in 1982. The effort to enact the proposition was led by the anti-tax group Citizens for Limited Taxation. It is similar to other \"tax revolt\" measures passed around the same time in other parts of the United States. This particular proposition followed the movements of states such as California.\n\nProposition 2½ appeared with five other initiatives presented to Massachusetts voters on November 4, 1980. It was question 2 on the ballot, \"Limiting local taxes (Proposition 2 1/2)\".\nSource:\n\nUnder Proposition 2½, a municipality is subject to two property tax limits:\n\nThese limits refer to the entire amount of the annual tax levy raised by a municipality. The property taxes are the sum of: (a) residential real property; (b) commercial real property; (c) industrial real property; and (d) business-owned personal property. In practice, it usually limits the tax bills of individual taxpayers, but only as an indirect result.\n\nA side effect of Proposition 2½ is that municipality income will decline in real terms whenever inflation rises above 2.5%. Historically inflation has been above 2.5% for a significant majority of the years since 1980 (22 out of the 28 years to date), thus resulting in a real decline in local tax rates and local spending ability.\n\nAn exception allows the citizens of each municipality to override the 2½ restriction to address specific needs of the community thus giving the citizens direct control over their taxation.\n\nThe property tax levy is the revenue a community can raise through real and personal property taxes. It is the largest source of revenue for most cities and towns. Proposition 2½ puts constraints on the amount of the levy raised by the city and how much it can be increased each year. It had two types of levy limits. The first of the two stated that a community cannot levy more than 2.5 percent of the total full and fair cash value of all taxable real and personal property. The full and fair cash value limit is known as the levy ceiling. The second type stated that it can only increase a certain amount from year to year. This is known as the levy limit. The levy limit will always be below or equal to the levy ceiling. The limits for each community is calculated by the Department of Revenue.\n\nThe excise tax for automobiles registered in Massachusetts was also lowered by Proposition 2½. Previously, this tax was levied at a rate of $66.00 per $1,000 of car valuation (6.6%). Proposition 2½ lowered this rate to $25.00 per $1,000 of car valuation, resulting in a 2½ per cent excise tax rate, but can still increase 264%, to the previous 6.6% tax rate if a Proposition 2½ operational override (see below) is approved by ballot in a community during a general (or special referendum) election.\n\nProposition 2½ excludes four cases from the limitation on tax levy increases:\n\n\nAnd three types of exclusions granted by the majority those voting in a municipal referendum:\n\n\nMunicipalities may exceed or reduce the limits with the prior approval of the majority those voting in a municipal referendum to:\n\nThe proposition originally required a two-thirds majority for passage of overrides, but the state legislature changed this to a simple majority in 1981.\n\nA professional survey firm conducted half-hour phone interviews in 58 randomly selected cities in Massachusetts where 1,561 household heads answer questions about Proposition 2½. The results of the interview concluded that the people of Massachusetts thought that Proposition 2½ would lead to a more responsible government, more efficiency in local government, and more voter control over schools. The people also thought that public sector jobs would become riskier. Some feared for the loss of their jobs or the decline in quality of them. Another thing people expected were effects on clusters of services. The peoples' household services were feared to be changed greatly. The people of Massachusetts desired spending and taxing by state government, local government, and local public schools more than other places to spend tax dollars. Many people expected Proposition 2½ to lead to welfare reductions. Finally, analysis of the survey shows that voters who expected welfare to be cut back were more likely to support Proposition 2½.\n\nFollowing the mandating of actual revenue reductions within the first couple of years, the effects and results of Proposition 2½ were limited. The lack of significant changes was due in part to the state government increasing general purpose aid to municipalities, which helped them to stay away from budget shortfalls. Effective property tax rates declining and an increase in community taxes were a result of various factors including a 64% increase in real estate aid to municipalities between 1981 and 1988, declining school expenses, and a region wide real estate boom. Reduced revenues in the 1980s caused the state to reduce local aid, which fell 12% in 1990, along with over 30% between 1989–1992. Over time, Proposition 2½ would have become more binding due to the fact that it is operated in nominal terms, meaning that the rules it follows do not change in response to prices, costs, or spending.\n\n, municipalities had requested, via referendum, 4,449 overrides of Proposition 2½, of which 1,798 passed; 16 underrides were requested, of which nine passed.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the only member of the genus \"Stigmochelys\", although in the past it was commonly placed in \"Geochelone\". This tortoise is a grazing species that favors semi-arid, thorny to grassland habitats. In both very hot and very cold weather they may dwell in abandoned fox, jackal, or aardvark holes. Leopard tortoises do not dig other than to make nests in which to lay eggs. Given its propensity for grassland habitats, it grazes extensively upon mixed grasses. It also favors succulents and thistles.\n\nThe phylogenic placement of the leopard tortoise has been subject to several revisions. Different authors have placed it in \"Geochelone\" (1957), \"Stigmochelys\" (2001), \"Centrochelys\" (2002), and \"Psammobates\" (2006). More recently, consensus appears to have settled on \"Stigmochelys\", a monotypic genus. There has been considerable debate about the existence of two subspecies but recent work does not support this distinction.\n\"Stigmochelys\" is a combination of Greek words: \"stigma\" meaning \"mark\" or \"point\"* and \"chelone\" meaning \"tortoise\". The specific name \"pardalis\" is from the Latin word \"pardus\" meaning \"leopard\" and refers to the leopard-like spots on the tortoise's shell.\n\nThe leopard tortoise is the fourth largest species of tortoise in the world, with typical adults reaching and weighing . Adults tend to be larger in the northern and southern ends of their range, where typical specimens weigh up to and an exceptionally large tortoise may reach and weigh .\n\nThe carapace is high and domed with steep, almost vertical sides. Juveniles and young adults are attractively marked with black blotches, spots or even dashes and stripes on a yellow background. In mature adults the markings tend to fade to a nondescript brown or grey. The head and limbs are uniformly colored yellow, tan, or brown.\n\nWidely distributed across the arid and savanna regions of eastern and southern Africa, extending from South Sudan and Somalia, across East Africa to South Africa and Namibia. The species is generally absent from the humid forest regions of Central Africa. Over this range, the leopard tortoise occupies the most varied habitats of any African tortoise including grasslands, thorn-scrub, mesic brushland, and savannas. They can be found at altitudes ranging from sea level to .\n\nLeopard tortoises are herbivorous; their diet consists of a wide variety of plants including forbs, thistles, grasses, and succulents. They will sometimes gnaw on bones or even hyena feces to obtain calcium, necessary for bone development and their eggshells. Seeds will pass undigested through the gut, so the leopard tortoise plays a significant role in seed dispersal. Normally active during the day, they are less active during hot weather or during the dry season.\n\nA very long-lived animal, the leopard tortoise reaches sexual maturity between the ages of 12 and 15 years. During the mating season, males will fight over females, ramming and butting their competitors. They will trail after females for quite some distance, often ramming them into submission. When mating, the male makes grunting vocalizations. Nesting occurs between May and October when the female digs a hole and lays a clutch of 5 to 30 eggs. As many as 5–7 clutches may be laid in a single season. Incubation will take 8–15 months depending on temperature. There are numerous predators of the eggs and hatchlings including monitor lizards, snakes, jackals and crows. Adults have few natural predators but lions and hyenas have occasionally been reported preying on them.\n\nThe leopard tortoise is a widespread species and remains common throughout most of its range. Human activities, including agricultural burning, consumption, and especially commercial exploitation in the pet trade, are potential threats but have not yet caused significant population declines. They are increasingly being bred in captivity for the pet trade. For example, most tortoises exported from Kenya and Tanzania originate in captive breeding programs, alleviating collection from the wild.\n\nThe leopard tortoise has been listed in Appendix II of CITES since 1975 and in 2000, the United States banned their import because of the risk posed by heartwater, an infectious disease carried by tortoise ticks that could seriously impact the US livestock industry.\n\n\n\n"}

He received an honorary Doctorate from the University in 1999.\n\nHarris started his career at CNN's world headquarters in Atlanta in the early 1980s as an unpaid intern while completing his degree. Following graduation in 1983, Harris started as an entry-level video journalist and later moved up to assistant director of the satellite department as an operator and coordinator. In that position, he oversaw and negotiated international and domestic satellite services used to cover new events, including the Persian Gulf War and President Ronald Reagan and President George H.W. Bush's international trips and summits.\n\nHarris auditioned for an anchor position during summer 1991; a few months later he was given a full-time anchor post. Harris received numerous awards at CNN, including several Emmy Awards for his coverage of the 2000 presidential election, the Oklahoma City bombing and the September 11th attacks. However, as competition increased from Fox News, and CNN veterans such as Natalie Allen and Lou Waters were pink-slipped in favor of Paula Zahn and Aaron Brown, Harris felt less comfortable. His last position held at CNN was co-anchor of \"CNN Live Today\" with Daryn Kagan.\n\nIn July 2003, Harris signed a deal with the Washington, D.C. ABC affiliate WJLA-TV to anchor that station’s 5 o'clock and 11 o’clock newscasts. He started his new post on October 28. In 2006, Harris received the 2006 local Emmy award for Best Anchor. On September 2, 2016, WJLA declined to renew his contract and his tenure at the station ended in October of that year.\n\nIn 2013, Harris was profiled for surviving two brushes with death, due to necrotizing pancreatitis.\n\nIn April 2017, NBC owned-and-operated station WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. announced that Leon Harris would join its news team on April 21. He currently co-anchors News 4 at 4 alongside Pat Lawson-Muse and reports for News 4 at 11.\n\nHarris currently lives in Avenel, Potomac, Maryland with his wife Dawn, a nurse at a local hospital.

Sloan, at the age of twelve. In 1855 he attended Georgia Military Institute in Marietta. He read law in Sandersville, and briefly practiced law in Atlanta before the outbreak of war.\n\nIn 1861, he joined the infantry, enlisting in Georgia's First Regiment. Within 2 years, Howell was promoted to first lieutenant. He fought under Stonewall Jackson in Virginia, and then was sent west, where he fought in the Battle of Chickamauga and the Atlanta Campaign, in which he defended the city as a captain of artillery. He ended the war in Hardee's Corps as captain of Howell's Battery, Georgia Light Artillery.\n\nUpon his return, he farmed for two years, clearing and selling lumber on his father's land near Atlanta. Then for a year he was a reporter, then city editor, of Atlanta's \"Daily Intelligencer\". In 1869 he returned to practicing law and served in a number of political positions including member of city council, member of the state Senate, and solicitor-general of the Atlanta circuit. One of his law clients was \"The Constitution\" where he learned E.Y. Clarke was willing to sell his one half interest in the paper. In 1876 Howell purchased the 50% interest in \"The Atlanta Constitution\" and became its editor-in-chief. For the next 25 years, the paper was owned by Howell and the managing partner, William Hemphill. Both Hemphill, and later Howell, would go on to serve as Mayor of Atlanta. \n\nWith Richard Peters, Samuel M. Inman, Lemuel Grant, and James W. English, he purchased the buildings on the site of the International Cotton Exposition of 1881 and made it the Exposition Cotton Mills, which were successful for many years.\n\nWhile editor of the \"Constitution\" in 1895, he sent out transcripts of Booker T. Washington's \"separate as the fingers\" speech across the country.\n\nHe served on the Atlanta city council numerous times and served as mayor shortly before his death at age 66.

It takes a novelistic approach, focusing on characters and the daily issues that they face.\n\nÅsne Seierstad entered Afghanistan two weeks after the September 11 attacks and followed the Northern Alliance into Kabul where she spent three months. Disguising herself by wearing a burka, she lived with a bookseller and his family in Kabul which provided her with a unique opportunity to describe life as ordinary Afghan citizens saw it.\n\nAs well as giving a historical account of events in Afghanistan as democracy is established, Seierstad focuses on the conditions of Afghan women who still live very much under the domination of men—Afghan traditions allow for polygamy and arranged marriage. She also addresses the conflict between westernization and traditional Islam, and gives an accessible account of Afghanistan's complex recent history under the rule of the USSR, the Taliban and coalition-supported democracy.\n\nFollowing global critical acclaim, many of the book's descriptions were contested by Rais, whose second wife Suraia sued the author in Norway for defamation.\n\nOn July 24, 2010, Seierstad was found guilty of defamation and “negligent journalistic practices and ordered to pay damages to Suraia Rais, wife of Shah Muhammad Rais”.\n\nSeierstad won an appeal which overturned the previous ruling and cleared the author and her publisher, Cappelen Damm, of invading the privacy of the Rais family, and concluded that the facts of the book were accurate.\n\nDuring a trip to Scandinavia in November 2005, Rais declared he was seeking asylum in either Norway or Sweden, as a political refugee. He felt things revealed about him in Seierstad's book had made life for him and his family unsafe in Afghanistan, where bootleg versions of the book had been published in Persian.\n\nRais has published his own version of the story, \"Once Upon a Time There Was a Bookseller in Kabull\" which has been translated into English and several other languages.\n\n"}
{"id": "1968146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968146", "title": "Roseanne Roseannadanna", "text": "Roseanne Roseannadanna\n\nRoseanne Roseannadanna is one of several recurring characters created and portrayed by Gilda Radner on \"Weekend Update\" in the early seasons of \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"SNL\"). She was the segment's consumer affairs reporter who, like an earlier Radner character Emily Litella, editorialized on current issues, only to go off-topic before being interrupted by the anchor. Unlike Litella's meek and apologetic character, Roseannadanna was brash and tactless. The character was based on Rose Ann Scamardella, a former anchorwoman on WABC-TV's \"Eyewitness News\" in New York City. The character also appeared later in Radner's live one-woman shows.\n\nRoseannadanna's \"Saturday Night Live\" commentary followed a strict formula. She usually read a letter from Richard Feder of Fort Lee, New Jersey, although she once read a letter from his wife, \"Mrs.\" Richard Feder. The letter would include a series of questions, usually about a current social issue, to which Roseannadanna made derogatory comments about New Jersey before moving on to respond to the question. The name Richard Feder was an in-joke; it was the name of an actual resident of Fort Lee who also happened to be the brother-in-law of \"SNL\" writer and segment co-creator Alan Zweibel. The “character” Feder moved to Mount St. Helens, Washington, while the real Feder moved to West Nyack, New York, but later moved back to New Jersey, settling in Hamburg.\n\nWhile answering the questions, Roseannadanna invariably digressed, launching into lengthy anecdotes, frequently having to do with an encounter with celebrities (Bo Derek, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Princess Grace, Gloria Vanderbilt, etc.) which had no relevance to the topic at hand. Invariably, the story led to Roseannadanna going into graphic detail about bodily functions or personal hygiene. The concept was that the celebrities had told her the graphic stories and she was simply relating them to the audience. She also provided response to these stories, which was the rhetorical question and catch phrase: \"What are ya tryin' to do, make me sick?!\"\n\nEventually, Weekend Update co-anchor Jane Curtin would interrupt, saying, \"Roseanne, you're making \"me\" sick.\" Curtin would then ask Roseannadanna what her comments had to do with the question. Radner would reply: \"Well, Jane, it just goes to show you, it's always something — if it’s not one thing, it's another.\"\n\nRoseannadanna's comments wrapped up with the sharing of a piece of advice passed along by a family member, most often her father, but sometimes her \"Nana Roseannadanna\". In one episode, she mentioned her aunt \"Pollyanna Roseannadanna\", while in others, her \"musically happening cousin Carlos Santana Roseannadanna\", her religious aunt \"Hosanna Roseannadanna\", and her singing cousin \"Lola Falana Roseannadanna\". In the final episode in which the character appeared, she mentioned her fashion designer aunt, \"Murjani Roseannadanni\".\n\nRadner's character had a tendency to refer to herself by her full name whenever possible: \"Mr. Feder, I know what you're talkin' about, because, I, \"Roseanne Roseannadanna\", once had the same thing happen to me.\" She often exaggerated her tribulations, saying: \"I thought I was gonna die!\"\n\nFor example, she narrated a story about eating a hamburger in a restaurant and feeling something hard in it. She spat it out and found it was white and looked like a toenail, and she said: \"I thought I was gonna die. I mean, what was a toenail doing in my hamburger?\". Then she went to the restroom and, on the way, she saw Princess Lee Radziwill whom she described as the: \"classy lady that no one knows where she's the princess of.\" However, what the Princess didn't know was that she had a tiny piece of toilet paper hanging off her shoe, and she was walking around and the toilet paper hadn't fallen off. \"I thought I was gonna be sick. So I said to her, 'Hey Princess Lee — what are ya tryin' to do, make me sick?'. Jane Curtin then asked her what this had to do with anything, and Roseannadanna replied: \"Well it just goes to show you, it's always something, you either got a toenail in your hamburger or toilet paper clinging to your shoe.\"\n\nIn Radner's off-Broadway one-woman show, she included a sketch where Roseanadanna is invited to give the commencement speech at Columbia University. After disclosing that she had not been the first choice for the commencement speech, and that the university only called her after Geraldo Rivera pulled out because he \"had a boil that needed to be lanced\", she attempts to prepare the new graduates for the hard road ahead by describing a job interview she once had with CBS, in which Walter Cronkite mistakenly thought that she'd \"passed gas\" and consequently kicked her out of his office.\n\nRoseannadanna was later credited as \"co-author\" of Radner's book \"Roseanne Roseannadanna's Hey Get Back to Work\". In the last year of her life, Radner released a memoir of her experience with ovarian cancer, entitled \"It's Always Something\". Radner also recorded the memoir as an audio book, imitating Roseannadanna and some of her other \"SNL\" characters when describing parts of her life.\n\n\nThe character also appeared in Radner's 1979 one-woman-show, \"Gilda Live.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1968154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968154", "title": "Image dissector", "text": "Image dissector\n\nAn image dissector, also called a dissector tube, is a video camera tube in which photocathode emissions create an \"electron image\" which is then scanned to produce an electrical signal representing the visual image. The term may apply specifically to a dissector tube employing magnetic fields to keep the electron image in focus, and an electron multiplier to scan the electrons. Dissectors were used only briefly in television systems before being replaced by the much more sensitive iconoscope during the 1930s.\n\nAn image dissector focuses a visual image onto a layer of photosensitive material, such as caesium oxide, which emits negatively charged \"photoelectrons\" proportional to the intensity of the light striking the material. Electrostatic deflecting plates or magnetic fields then periodically manipulate the resulting electron image horizontally and vertically before an electron multiplier, or a small aperture leading to a positively charged detector, or anode, in the case of the earliest dissector tubes. The electron multiplier or aperture permits only those electrons emanating from a very small area of the electron image, representing a similarly small area of the visual image. The entire image is scanned several times per second to produce an electrical signal suitably representative of a moving visual image.\n\nBecause the dissector does not store charge, it is useful for viewing the inside of furnaces and monitoring welding systems as it does not suffer from the \"flare\" normal picture tubes experience when looking at intense lights.\n\nIn April 1925, German professor Max Dieckmann and his student Rudolf Hell applied for a patent for a device named Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television). A patent was issued in October 1927, and their experiments were announced in the magazines \"Discovery\" and \"Popular Radio\", but they failed to reduce it to practice. In 1951, Hell claimed that he had made a tube but could not get it to function, since at the time there was an insufficient knowledge of electron optics, the manipulation of an electron beam by electric or magnetic fields.\n\nAmerican television pioneer Philo T. Farnsworth invented the first functional image dissector in 1927, submitting a patent application on January 7, 1927. On September 7 of that year, the image dissector successfully transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at Farnsworth's laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press, the first such successful demonstration of a fully electronic television system.\n\nIn 1929 Farnsworth eliminated a motor generator from the system, so it then had no mechanical parts. Further developments that year included improvements in image clarity and an increase in the number of lines of resolution, such that it exceeded that of the mechanical television systems. Also in 1929, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma (\"Pem\") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).\n\nSince the electrons emitted within an image dissector are collected by the electron multiplier or anode only during the very brief time an area of the \"electron image\" is exposed, the bulk of the electrons are lost. Thus the earliest image dissectors were very inefficient, and extremely bright illumination was required for it to be used effectively. Farnsworth addressed this problem with the invention of an \"electron multiplier\" (not to be confused with contemporary electron multipliers), a device that increased the number of electrons in a circuit by generating \"secondary emissions\" of electrons from a pair of opposed surfaces, thus amplifying the electrical signal.\n\nFarnsworth applied for a patent for his \"electron multiplier\" on March 3, 1930 and demonstrated its application in 1931. Farnsworth continued to improve the device, which would come to be called a \"multipactor\", such that it reportedly could amplify a signal to the 60th power or better, and showed great promise in other fields of electronics. A significant problem with the multipactor, however, was that it wore out at an unsatisfactorily rapid rate.\n\nOn August 25, 1934, Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of a complete, all-electronic television system, which included his image dissector, at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn April 1933, Farnsworth submitted a patent application entitled \"Image Dissector\", but which actually detailed a cathode ray tube (CRT) camera tube.\n\nBy late 1930s, dissectors were replaced by more efficient iconoscopes.\n\n\n"}

He batted and threw left-handed.\n\nRandy Myers grew up in Vancouver, Washington. His father was an auto mechanic and a machinist. He is a graduate of Evergreen High School and Clark College. Myers was drafted in the first round (ninth overall) of the 1982 amateur draft.\n\nMyers began his Major League career with the New York Mets in 1985 under the management of Davey Johnson, and was a member of the Mets 1986 World Series-winning team (although he did not appear on the Mets' postseason roster then, he was given a belated World Series ring nine years later in 1995). Myers became a closer in 1988 as he platooned with Roger McDowell after Jesse Orosco left for the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nMyers was traded to the Reds in 1990 for closer John Franco, and became one of the league's elite closers and the most successful member of the Nasty Boys trio, which also included Rob Dibble and Norm Charlton, while being selected as an All-Star in 1990. In 1990 Myers won his second World Series ring as the Reds swept the Oakland Athletics. In 1991, the Reds experimented with Myers as a starter, a move that proved highly unsuccessful as he posted a record of 6 wins and 13 losses.\n\nIn 1992, Myers became the closer for the Padres. After only one season in San Diego, Myers was a Cub in 1993 where he posted his best statistical season with a then National League record 53 saves. In a September 28, 1995 game vs. the Astros, Myers was attacked by a fan at Wrigley Field after giving up a home run. In 1994 and 1995, Myers earned his second and third All-Star selections. After the 1995 season, Myers became a member of the Orioles where he had two more solid seasons, highlighted by an All-Star selection in 1997, when he saved 45 games. Myers had 28 saves for the Blue Jays in his final season, 1998, before being traded back to the Padres after being claimed on waivers. Though he was under contract for both 1999 and 2000, he did not pitch in the Major Leagues after 1998.\n\nIn a 14-year Major League career, Myers compiled a 3.19 ERA, 347 saves, 44 wins, 63 losses and struck out 884 batters in 884.2 innings. As of the end of the 2019 Major League Baseball season, Myers ranks 12th all-time in saves, and is a member of the 300 save club.\n\nIn 2000, Myers earned a salary of US$6,916,667.00 while unable to pitch due to a damaged shoulder. Most of his 1999 and 2000 seasons were spent receiving treatment after undergoing rotator cuff surgery in 1999; his injury resulted in a legal dispute between the Padres and their insurance carrier after the carrier denied an $8 million claim due to Myers' inability to play.\n\nThe Padres' 1998 waiver claim of Myers is considered one of the biggest blunders in the history of the waiver wire. The Padres did not want Myers, mostly because of the $12 million and two additional years remaining on his contract as well as the fact that they already had an established closer in Trevor Hoffman, but placed a waiver claim in order to prevent him from going to the rival Atlanta Braves. They expected the Blue Jays to rescind their waiver claim, but the Blue Jays instead allowed the waiver claim to go through, leaving them responsible for the rest of his contract.\n\nIn October 1990, Myers was featured on the 18-ounce box of Wheaties breakfast cereal along with fellow Cincinnati Reds 1990 World Series champions Eric Davis, José Rijo, Barry Larkin, Chris Sabo, and Hal Morris.\n\nFor many years during his pro baseball career he assisted in coaching the women's basketball team at his alma mater, Clark Community College. He is widely involved in charities in Vancouver through his Randy Myers Foundation. He also has a lifelong involvement in martial arts.\n\nClark College did not field a baseball team after the 1992 season, but by 2011, thanks in large part of Myers' efforts fundraising and spearheading the program's revival, Clark again started playing baseball in 2011.\n\n\n"}

When he demands Martha's necklace, Thomas moves to protect his wife and Chill panics and shoots him; he then kills Martha when she screams for help (in later versions up to the 1970s, Martha dies from a heart attack brought on from the shock of seeing her husband murdered). Chill runs away when Bruce begins crying and calling for help — but not before the boy memorizes his features. In at least three versions of the \"Batman\" mythos, the Waynes' killer is never identified.\n\nBatman's origin story is first established in a sequence of panels in \"Detective Comics\" #33 (November 1939) that is later reproduced in the comic book \"Batman\" #1 (Spring 1940), but the mugger is not given a name until \"Batman\" #47 (June–July 1948). In that issue, Batman discovers that Joe Chill, the small-time crime boss he is investigating, is none other than the man who killed his parents. Batman confronts him with the knowledge that Chill killed Thomas and Martha Wayne. Chill, believing there is no way Batman could know this, accuses him of bluffing, but Batman reveals his secret identity quoting \"I know because I am the son of the man you murdered! I am Bruce Wayne!!\" Terrified, Chill flees and seeks protection from his henchmen. Once his henchmen learn that Chill's actions led to the hated Batman's existence, however, they turn on their boss and gun him down before suddenly realizing how priceless his knowledge of Batman's true identity is. Before the dying Chill has a chance to reveal Batman's identity, the Dark Knight intervenes and knocks out the goons. Chill expires in Batman's arms, acknowledging that the Dark Knight got his revenge after all. Len Wein and John Byrne add a one-panel coda in their retelling of this scene in the first issue of \"The Untold Legend of the Batman\". Batman stands over Chill's body and says \"No, Chill -- The Batman didn't finish you... It was Bruce Wayne!\"\n\nIn \"Detective Comics\" #235 (1956), Batman learns that Chill was not a mere mugger, but actually a hitman who murdered the Waynes on orders from a mob boss named Lew Moxon. Batman also deduced that was why he himself was left unharmed by Chill: so he would unwittingly support Moxon's alibi that he had nothing to do with a robbery that was really a planned murder.\n\nIn \"The Brave and the Bold\" #79 (Sep. 1968), Joe Chill is revealed to have a brother named Max who is also a criminal. Max Chill is suspected of having murdered Boston Brand (AKA Deadman), though the suspicion proves erroneous. Max is killed when a stack of slot machines falls onto him.\n\nIn \"Batman\" #208 (Jan./Feb. 1969), it is revealed that both Joe and Max had changed their name to Chill from Chilton and that their mother was the housekeeper to Bruce Wayne's uncle Philip Wayne, who became Bruce's primary guardian after his parents' deaths. As he was often away on business, Mrs. Chilton played the primary parental role in the boy's life. As an adult, Bruce continues to visit the elderly woman, whom he still calls \"Mom Chilton\". He is unaware of her connection with Joe and Max Chill. For her part, Mrs. Chilton knows Bruce is secretly Batman and is proud of him. She is also aware that her sons died fighting him, and she still mourns their deaths. (Perhaps because they were both domestic servants, Alfred, the adult Bruce's butler, was secretly aware of Mrs. Chilton's connection, but he kept that information from Bruce. He once mused that \"in her own way, that dear woman more than made up for her son's heinous crime\".)\n\nIn the 1987 storyline \"\", Chill played a key role. Several Gotham City crime bosses pool their resources to deal with a lethal vigilante called the Reaper, and Chill, an experienced button man, is hired to take him out. When Batman proposes an alliance with the bosses, they agree that he and Chill will work together — something Batman finds repugnant, but which he nevertheless justifies to himself as necessary to tackle the Reaper. He vows to kill Chill afterwards. Chill is also secretly commissioned to kill Batman after the Reaper has been disposed of. During a major confrontation, the crime bosses are all killed in a shootout at a warehouse, in which the Reaper seemingly also perishes. Chill reasons that he has no reason to fulfill his contract, but Batman takes him to \"Crime Alley\", the scene of his parents' murder. There he confronts Chill and reveals his identity. Batman has Chill at gunpoint, but the Reaper then appears and guns Chill down. It is left ambiguous as to whether or not Batman would have actually pulled the trigger.\n\nIn the 1991 sequel to \"Year Two\", \"Batman: Full Circle\", Chill's son, Joe Chill, Jr. assumes the identity of the Reaper in order to seek revenge for his father's death. He attempts to drive Batman insane by using hallucinogenic drugs in conjunction with a faked video of the Waynes' murder to trigger Batman's survivor's guilt over his parents' death and thus break his will. After the intervention of Robin, Batman frees himself from the drug-induced haze. After the new Reaper is defeated, Batman learns to let go of his hatred of Chill.\n\nIn \"Detective Comics\" #678, a \"Zero Hour\" crossover story, Batman finds himself in an alternate timeline where, instead of his parents, he was killed by a mugger. Investigating the crime, he discovers that Chill, at least in this timeline, did not commit the murder. Once he returns to his own timeline, Bruce Wayne is plagued with doubt. He wonders if there's a possibility that he never actually caught or confronted his parents' killer. He also wonders if that makes any difference regarding his crimefighting career. Ultimately, he concludes that it does not.\n\nIn 2006, \"Infinite Crisis\" #6 reestablished that Chill was responsible for shooting Thomas and Martha Wayne, and that he was later arrested on that same night for their murder.\n\nIn the 2008 Grant Morrison story \"Joe Chill in Hell\" (featured in \"Batman\" #673), Chill is reinterpreted as a mid-level crime boss who builds the Land, Sea, and Air Transport company from the ground up (most likely through illegal means). He blames his crimes, including murdering the Waynes, on class warfare that forced him to do things he wouldn't have otherwise. In this story, Batman has visited and frightened Chill every night for a month. Chill is living as a shut-in, but his guards never see or catch Batman during the visits. On his final visit, Batman gives Chill the gun he used to kill the Waynes, with a single bullet loaded in it. Chill finally realizes who Batman is and fears what his fellow gangsters might do if they found out he was responsible for creating him. It is implied that he uses his gun to commit suicide. Considering the issue consists of Bruce's flashbacks and hallucinations from an experiment he undergoes during his early career, however, it is left ambiguous whether the events of the story are real.\n\nIn 2009's \"Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?\" by Neil Gaiman, Joe Chill is seen as the bartender attending Batman's funeral (the funeral itself being a near death experience). Batman, who is observing the event as well as Catwoman, note that Joe Chill should be dead. Chill notes that he was there at the birth of Batman and it is only fitting he should be there to witness the end.\n\nIn The New 52, the 2011 reboot of DC Comics' primary continuity, an 18-year-old Bruce Wayne tracks Chill down and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know who hired him to kill his parents. Chill responds that he just wanted Martha Wayne's pearls so he could buy alcohol and that he didn't even know who the Waynes were until the next day. Enraged that Chill killed his parents for no good reason, Bruce prepares to kill him, but relents at the last minute when he realizes that his father would not have wanted that. After sparing Chill's life, Bruce Wayne leaves Gotham City and begins training to fight crime, vowing that he will make sure what Chill did never happens to anyone else.\n\nIn Frank Miller's 1986 limited series \"\", Bruce Wayne finally resolves his feelings towards Chill (who is not named). While about to be mugged by street punks, Bruce initially fantasizes that the two amateur criminals are both Joe Chill, so he can take out his rage on them. They leave him alone, however, after realizing he would have fought them : \"Look at him. He's into it. No fun when they're into it\". Bruce realizes that Chill had not killed his parents for killing's sake, as the two punks wanted to do to him, and thus was not truly evil. \"All he wanted was money\", he thinks to himself. \"He was sick and guilty over what he did. I was naïve enough to think him the lowest sort of man\".\n\nIn the comics featuring the Crime Syndicate of America, it is revealed that on the Syndicate's alternate Earth, Joe Chill was a friend of Dr. Thomas Wayne. One night, a police officer wants to bring the elder Wayne in for questioning. When he refuses, the police officer suddenly opens fire. This Earth's version of Bruce Wayne and Martha Wayne are killed. Chill comes out of an alleyway to discover the dead bodies and the Waynes' younger son Thomas Wayne Jr., leaves with him, blaming his father for his mother and brother's deaths, and seeing Chill as the only father figure he has left.\n\nIn the alternate universe of \"Flashpoint\", Joe Chill shoots and kills the young Bruce Wayne, and Thomas Wayne seeks to kill him to avenge his son. He locates Chill and attempts to inject him with a drug, but instead beats him to death in a vengeful fury. Afterwards, Thomas puts Chill's gun in a trophy display in the Batcave.\n\nJoe Chill is featured in many Elseworld titles, including \"\", \"Citizen Wayne\", \"\", \"\", \"Batman of Arkham\", \"\", and \"Dark Knight Dynasty\".\n\nJoe Chill is featured in the comic book continuation of the television series \"Smallville\", albeit with no connection to Batman. Instead, he worked as an Intergang contact before being killed by Mr. Freeze.\n\nJoe Chill appears in \"The Batman Adventures\" #17, which is set in the continuity of \"\" and its DCAU spinoffs. In a story by Ty Templeton entitled \"Fear Itself\", Chill is shown to have spent his whole life as a career criminal since the night he murdered Bruce's parents. The story begins with Chill being released from prison after finishing a sentence for an unrelated crime, and it is apparent that he has been living in fear since that fateful night. Chill is convinced that Bruce Wayne, now one of the most powerful men on the planet, is biding his time to exact revenge. Chill's paranoia is so severe that he begins to see Bruce's face everywhere around him, even on other people. His paranoia goes into overdrive when he discovers that the retired police detective who originally worked on the Wayne case has finally discovered evidence that he was the killer. Chill tracks the detective to his apartment and attempts to silence him, but Batman intervenes, unaware of who Chill is. In a brief scuffle Chill manages to unmask Batman, revealing the visage of Bruce Wayne. Terrified, Chill falls off a balcony, and Batman jumps after him in an attempt to save his life. Batman nearly catches Chill, who pushes him away in terror and falls to his death. Batman is left at the end of the story wondering who the mysterious man was and why he would rather die than accept his help.\n\nIn \"Batman Beyond Unlimited\" set in the DC Animated Universe, Chill is revealed to have a brother. Chill's grandnephew eventually has a child of his own, Jake. In the continuity, Jake Chill is a former security guard at Wayne-Powers, working under Derek Powers' \"Quiet Squad\". Having killed Warren McGinnis under Mr. Fixx's orders, Jake repeats his great-granduncle's history with the Waynes and indirectly creates another Batman. Though no one discovers his involvement with McGinnis' murder, Jake Chill is wracked with guilt and decides to become a vigilante to redeem his family's sins. Jake takes the name Vigilante, modified the uniform he got from his former employer as his costume, and works with Batman to stop a riot led by the Jokerz. He is eventually killed in the \"Mark of the Phantasm\" storyline, where he suffers a seizure after being injected with Joker Toxin and inhaling the Phantasm's fear gas. Though Terry lashed out at Jake after discovering Jake killed his father, he ultimately respected Jake as a hero and regretted that he died the way he did.\n\nIn Andrew Vachss' novel \"\", Chill (who is never seen) is revealed to have killed Bruce Wayne's parents on the orders of an international ring of pedophiles. They wanted to silence Bruce's mother Martha, who was investigating their network of sexual slavery and child pornography.\n\nOn the alternate world of Earth-Two as part of \"The New 52\", Joe Chill is a hired assassin who shoots Thomas and Martha Wayne. Chill is later killed when Thomas Wayne (who had survived the shooting) crushes his skull in retaliation for Martha's death.\n\nIn the prequel comic to \"\", Joe Chill is the right-hand man of crime lord Lew Moxon. When Batman corners them during a meeting with the other crimelords, he kills Lew Moxon and drinks Joe Chill's blood. Upon becoming a vampire, Joe Chill later kills Lew Moxon's wife Angela. Batman avenges her death by killing Chill with an axe.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The building houses the bicameral state legislature and the office of the governor. Located in Sacramento, the Neoclassical structure was completed between 1861 and 1874 at the west end of Capitol Park, which is framed by L Street to the north, N Street to the south, 10th Street to the west, and 15th Street to the east.\n\nThe structure was completed between 1861 and 1874. The Capitol and grounds were listed on the office of the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and listed as a California Historical Landmark in 1974, with a re-dedication on January 9, 1982, to commemorate the close of the bicentennial restoration project. The building had undergone a major renovation, known as the California State Capitol Restoration, from 1975 until 1982 to restore the Capitol to its former beauty and to retrofit the structure for earthquake safety. Although not generally considered earthquake country, Sacramento was hit by two earthquakes within days of each other in 1892 which damaged the Capitol.\n\nThe building is based on the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. The west facade ends in projecting bays, and a portico projects from the center of the building. At the base of the portico, seven granite archways brace and support the porch above. Eight fluted Corinthian columns line the portico. A cornice supports the pediment above depicting Minerva surrounded by Education, Justice, Industry and Mining.\n\nAbove the flat roof with balustrade are two drums supporting a dome. The first drum consists of a colonnade of Corinthian columns; the second, Corinthian pilasters. Large arched windows line the drum walls. The dome is high, and supports a lantern with a smaller dome capped with a gold-leafed orbed finial.\n\nThe California Senate chamber seats its forty members in a large chamber room decorated in red, which is a reference to the British House of Lords, also the upper house of a bicameral legislature. The chamber is entered through a second floor corridor. From the coffered ceiling hangs an electric reproduction of the original gas chandelier. A hand-carved dais caps off a recessed bay framed by Corinthian columns.\n\nThe Latin phrase \"\"Senatoris est civitatis libertatem tueri\"\" [\"It is the duty of the Senator to guard the civil liberties of the Commonwealth\"] lines the cornice. A portrait of George Washington by Jane Stuart, the daughter of Gilbert Stuart, is on the wall above. The State Seal hangs above.\n\nStatues of the Roman goddess Minerva once overlooked both chambers. Today, Minerva, sculpted by Michael H. Casey, appears only in the senate chambers.\n\nGilded Corinthian columns support the gallery above, and dark red curtains that can be drawn for privacy are tied back along the columns. High arched windows run along the bottom below rectangular pane windows. Behind the rostrum, there are two chairs with red velvet cushions, reserved for the president \"pro tempore\" of the senate and the speaker of the assembly, but are never used.\n\nThe California Assembly chamber is located at the opposite end of the building. Its green tones are based on those of the British House of Commons, the lower house. The dais rests along a wall shaped like an \"E\", with the central projection housing the rostrum. Along the cornice appears a quotation from Abraham Lincoln in Latin: \"Legislatorum est justas leges condere\" (\"It is the duty of legislators to establish just laws\"). Almost every decorating element is identical to the Senate Chamber.\n\nThe capitol's grounds are known as Capitol Park, an area of 10 undivided city blocks running from 10th to 16th and from L to N Streets. The entire Capitol Park area is included in the National Register historic district listing. The park is managed by the California State Capitol Museum.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1968182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968182", "title": "Benzoin condensation", "text": "Benzoin condensation\n\nThe benzoin condensation is an addition reaction involving two aldehydes. The reaction generally occurs between aromatic aldehydes or glyoxals. The reaction produces an acyloin. In the classic application benzaldehyde is converted to benzoin. \n\nThe benzoin condensation was first reported in 1832 by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich Wöhler during their research on bitter almond oil. The catalytic version of the reaction involving cyanide was developed by Nikolay Zinin in the late 1830s,\n\nThe reaction is catalyzed by nucleophiles such as a cyanide or an N-heterocyclic carbene (usually thiazolium salts). The reaction mechanism was proposed in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth.\nIn the first step in this reaction, the cyanide anion (as sodium cyanide) reacts with the aldehyde in a nucleophilic addition. Rearrangement of the intermediate results in polarity reversal of the carbonyl group, which then adds to the second carbonyl group in a second nucleophilic addition. Proton transfer and elimination of the cyanide ion affords benzoin as the product. This is a reversible reaction, which means that the distribution of products is determined by the relative thermodynamic stability of the products and starting material.\n\nIn this reaction, one aldehyde donates a proton and one aldehyde accepts a proton. Some aldehydes can only donate protons, such as 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde whereas benzaldehyde is both a proton acceptor and donor. In this way it is possible to synthesise mixed benzoins, i.e. products with different groups on each half of the product. However, care should be taken to match a proton donating aldehyde with a proton accepting aldehyde to avoid undesired homo-dimerization.\n\nThe reaction can be extended to aliphatic aldehydes with base catalysis in the presence of thiazolium salts; the reaction mechanism is essentially the same... These compounds are important in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. The analogous 1,4-addition of an aldehyde to an enone is called the Stetter reaction.\n\nIn biochemistry, the coenzyme thiamine is responsible for biosynthesis of acyloin-like compounds utilizing the benzoin addition. This coenzyme also contains a thiazolium moiety, which on deprotonation becomes a nucleophilic carbene.\n\nThe asymmetric version of this reaction has been performed by utilizing chiral thiazolium and triazolium salts. Triazolium salts were found to give greater enantiomeric excess than thiazolium salts. An example is shown below.\n\nSince the products of the reaction are thermodynamically controlled, the Retro Benzoin Addition can be synthetically useful. If a benzoin or acyloin can be synthesized by another method, then they can be converted into the component ketones using cyanide or thiazolium catalysts. The reaction mechanism is the same as above, but it occurs in the reverse direction. This can allow the access of ketones otherwise difficult to produce.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1968183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968183", "title": "Kawanishi K-200", "text": "Kawanishi K-200\n\nThe Kawanishi K-200 was a concept for a turbojet-powered flying boat proposed in Japan late in World War II. With Japan in a critical state, the K-200 never reached the drawing board. There is very little data on the K-200 and contemporary illustrations of the K-200 are based on speculation.\n\nDrawing on the company's E11K1 and K-60 designs, the K-200 was to use six turbojets. The suggestion that the K-200 was intended to replace other long-range heavy flying boats in Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) service and that the K-200 was also proposed as the delivery platform to carry a Japanese nuclear weapon to the United States are not supported with evidence.\n\nThe IJN may have asked Kawanishi to consider a turbojet powered flying boat or it may have been a company initiative. Support for the latter comes from the IJN's request for the Kawanishi H11K Soku and the K-60, both large flying boats, and thus the suggestion may have been put forth.\n\nFor such a large flying boat, the K-200 likely would have been powered by the Ne-330 turbojet. This was the last turbojet design in progress before the war ended and which had the highest thrust rating at 1,300 kg of thrust. However, the Ne-330 consumed 1.95 kg of fuel per kg of thrust and six Ne-330 engines would have resulted in the K-200 needing to devote a large portion of its weight for fuel. A consequence of this would be a rather short operational range, inferior to the main IJN flying boat, the Kawanishi H8K \"Emily\", even through the speed would have been faster. This shorter range would have made the K-200 a poor candidate as an aircraft capable of reaching the U.S. to deliver an atomic weapon.\n\nThe engines were mounted on top of the wing, three per wing. This position would minimize water ingestion by the engines.\n\nIt is likely that the K-200 sported a weapon fit similar to the H8K. This would have consisted of a Type 99 20mm cannon in a tail turret and in a turret on the top of the fuselage, forward of the wings. Blisters on the forward port sides of the hull would have carried either the Type 99 or the Type 92 7.7mm machine-gun. Another cannon was located in the nose. The K-200 may have also been capable of carrying torpedoes, depth charges, or bombs.\n\nAs a note, one such illustration of the K-200 looks much like the Russian Beriev R-1.\n\nThe war ended before plans for the K-200 could be completed.\n"}
{"id": "1968190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968190", "title": "Chambertin", "text": "Chambertin\n\nChambertin is an \"Appellation d'origine contrôlée\" (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for red wine in the Côte de Nuits subregion of Burgundy, with Pinot noir as the main grape variety. Chambertin is located within the commune of Gevrey-Chambertin, and it is situated approximately in the centre of a group of nine Grand Cru vineyards all having \"Chambertin\" as part of their name. The other eight vineyards, which all are separate AOCs, have hyphenated names where Chambertin appears together with something else, such as Chapelle-Chambertin. Chambertin itself is situated above (to the west of) the Route des Grands Crus. It borders on Chambertin-Clos de Bèze in the north, Griotte-Chambertin and Charmes-Chambertin in the east (across the road) and the Latricières-Chambertin in the south. The AOC was created in 1937.\n\nOf the surrounding vineyards, wines from Chambertin-Clos de Bèze may also be sold under the Chambertin AOC. However, Chambertin-Clos de Bèze has a very good reputation on its own, so this is not widely practiced. The other seven \"hyphenated Chambertin\" Grand Cru vineyards do not have this right to use the Chambertin AOC.\n\nAs with most of Burgundy's vineyards, both Chambertin and Clos de Bèze have had numerous owners, twenty-three and eighteen respectively. Unfortunately, quality varies from producer to producer and, although Chambertin has been called \"King of Wines,\" less accomplished winemakers do not always produce wines that fully live up to that reputation. The quality of wines from Clos de Bèze is considered higher and more consistent than those from Chambertin. The best wines from these two vineyards are quite powerful. They have concentrated fruit flavors, intense, rich, perfumed aromas, and long aging capabilities.\n\nThe Clos de Bèze vineyard was initially cleared and planted back in the 7th century by monks from the Abbey of Bèze, which owned the land. Legend has it that it was not until the 12th century that Chambertin itself was planted by a Monsieur Bertin, who felt that he could also make good wines if he grew the same grape varieties as his famous next-door neighbor. His vineyard was called Champ de Bertin (\"Bertin's field\") and later shortened to Chambertin.\n\nIn 1702, Claude Jobert acquired both vineyards uniting both Chambertin and Clos de Bèze.\n\nThe Chambertin wines were one of Napoleon's favorites and it is said that he insisted that they be available to him even during his various military campaigns. According to Hazlitt, Chambertin was the only wine Napoleon drank during his reign as Emperor, \"and he seldom drank it pure.\"\n\nChambertin is the brief focus of a joke featured in the 1951 film \"Love Nest\" which costarred Marilyn Monroe in a supporting lead, though she is not present in the scene where the vintage is explicitly mentioned. The scene is set in a nightclub restaurant where \"elderly Casanova\" Charley Patterson (Frank Fay) is once again attempting to swindle money from one of the many widowed dowagers he regularly courts. After they place their orders the waiter asks the couple if they would care for champagne with their dinner to which Charley declares nonchalantly; \"Champagne is for peasants\". The waiter then suggests Chambertin and adds that Charley has \"excellent taste.\" Charley's date, oblivious and entranced, remarks that she does \"admire a man who knows how to order...\"\n\nIn 2008, of vineyard surface was in production for Chambertin AOC, and 437 hectoliter of wine was produced under the Chambertin designation, corresponding to slightly less than 60,000 bottles.\n\nThe main grape variety for Chambertin is Pinot noir. The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes, but this is practically never used for any Burgundy Grand Cru vineyard. The allowed base yield is 35 hectoliter per hectare, a minimum planting density of 9,000 vines per hectare is required as well as a minimum grape maturity of 11.5 per cent potential alcohol.\n\nOf the producers in Chambertin, the wines of Domaine Armand Rousseau generally command the highest prices. Rousseau owns in Chambertin, as well as a total of in four of the other \"Chambertin\" Grands Crus.\n\nOther vineyard owners with more than in Chambertin are Domaine Jean-Louis Trapet, Domaine Rossignol-Trapet and Camus Père et Fils. Between and 1 ha each is held by Louis Latour, Domaine Jacques Prieur and Domaine Leroy.\n\nTogether, the nine \"Chambertin\" Grand Cru vineyards of Gevrey-Chambertin form a continuous area which roughly forms a rectangle by in size, situated just south of the town of Gevrey-Chambertin itself. In three of the vineyards, the producers are free to choose between two Grand Cru appellations.\n\nIn general, Chambertin and Chambertin-Clos de Bèze is seen as one notch above the other seven Grands Crus in quality. This is also reflected in a small difference in the allowed yield, where Chambertin and Chambertin-Clos de Bèze are restricted to a base yield of 35 hl/ha, while the other seven are allowed 37 hl/ha.\n\n"}
{"id": "1968193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968193", "title": "DC-UK", "text": "DC-UK\n\nDC-UK was a Dreamcast video game magazine published by Future plc in the United Kingdom. Its first issue was published in August 1999 and it ran until 2001. The magazine was launched by ex-\"Edge\" deputy editor Caspar Field, who edited the first seven issues. After his departure to launch the children's Dreamcast magazine, \"Mr Dreamcast\", associate editor Keith Stuart took over until issue 19. At this point, then-deputy editor Lee Hart took over for the single issue that remained.\n\nAt launch, \"DC-UK\" changed the prevailing Future plc games magazine running order of the time, which went news - previews - features - reviews - tips - letters, by rearranging some of the major sections. This resulted in a running order of reviews - news - features - previews - tips - letters. The magazine also offered some additional content, such as interviews with game developers and attempts at unusual features, such as creating cocktails themed around famous Sega characters. Following Field's departure, \"DC-UK\" reverted to the standard Future plc format, which was used until the magazine's closure. The upbeat feel of the magazine, however, continued throughout every issue, and prior to being revised the title was nominated for the 1999 InDin Magazine of the Year award.\n\nSales of \"DC-UK\", particularly during the early months of its existence, were strong – often coming close to those of the \"Official Dreamcast Magazine (UK)\" despite the latter selling with a cover-mounted disc featuring demo versions of games. \"DC-UK\" had in fact started life as Future Publishing's pitch for the rights to the UK Dreamcast magazine license. However, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE), from which Future held the rights to the \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\", objected, leading Future to withdraw its bid for the Dreamcast deal.\n\nIn March 2000 Future published the first issue of the short-lived \"DC-UK\" spin-off title \"DC-TIPS\". Both \"DC-TIPS\" and \"DC-UK\"'s sales began to suffer during early 2000 as British public interest in Dreamcast declined during the run-up to PlayStation 2's November 2000 arrival in Europe.\n\nDuring the magazine's run it was supported by a website at dc-uk.co.uk. This closed on 8 March 2001,\nshortly after the magazine's last issue had gone on sale, with the message 'Goodbye folks!'.\n\n\"DC-TIPS\" was a magazine dedicated to game guides and tips for the Dreamcast and each issue was on average 128 pages long, for the price of £3.99. The magazine was launched as a companion to \"DC-UK\" and the two magazines were offered to readers in a special combination subscription. Issue #1 was published in March 2000, 7 months after \"parent\" magazine. The magazine was cancelled before issue #4 went to press, with most of the latest issue completed. Some of the commissioned work for future issues included \"\" and \"\".\n\nThe magazine was launched by Will Groves who was editor for the lifetime of the magazine. Richard Owen joined as the full-time staff writer halfway through the creation of the first issue. In charge of art was Brad Merrett and the designer was Efrain Mendoza. Contributors to the magazine included Dean Mortlock, Nadine Pittam, Daniel Glenfield, Sally Meddings and Jon Billington.\n\nThe colour orange was prevalent throughout the magazine, complimenting DC-UK's prevalent blue. It is worth noting that the Dreamcast logo in Europe was blue, and in the US and Japan it was orange. This made orange an obvious choice for DC-TIPS given that the design was so closely tied to its parent DC-UK.\n\nAlthough its run of magazines was short, \"DC-TIPS\" covered a relatively large number of games throughout its pages.

In 1903, he married Edna Belle Cheshire, daughter of Napoleon Cheshire (after whom Cheshire Bridge Road is named). He served as councilman of Atlanta's Ninth Ward.\n\nHe was twice elected mayor of Atlanta (both times defeating James L.

{"id": "1968196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968196", "title": "Poi (performance art)", "text": "Poi (performance art)\n\nPoi refers to both a style of performing art and the equipment used for engaging in poi performance. As a performance art, poi involves swinging tethered weights through a variety of rhythmical and geometric patterns. Poi artists may also sing or dance while swinging their poi. Poi can be made from various materials with different handles, weights, and effects (such as fire).\n\nPoi originated with the Māori people of New Zealand, where it is still practiced today. Poi has also gained a following in many other countries. The expansion of poi culture has led to a significant evolution of the styles practiced, the tools used, and the definition of the word \"poi.\"\n\nIn the Māori language, \"poi\" can mean the physical objects used by the dancers, the choreography itself, or the accompanying music. In Māori culture, poi performance is usually practiced by women. Some legends indicate that it was first used by men to develop wrist flexibility for the use of hand weapons such as the club-like patu, mere, and kotiate, but recent academic study has found no evidence to confirm this story.\n\nMāori poi come in two forms: short, with strings equal to the length of the fingertips to the wrist; and long, with strings equal to the distance from fingertips to shoulder. A performance includes storytelling and singing in conjunction with choreographed poi routines and is often presented alongside other disciplines, such as \"waiata a ringa\", haka and \"titi torea\" (included in kapa haka performances). Poi feature in the 1980s hit song \"Poi E\".\n\nOriginally, poi were most commonly made from harakeke (New Zealand flax, \"Phormium tenax\") and raupō (\"Typha orientalis\"). Makers stripped and scraped flax to provide the muka (inner flax fibre), which was twisted into two strands to make the taura (cord) as well as the aho (ties). A large knot was tied at one end of the cord, around which the core was formed from the pithy middle of the raupō stem. Dampened strips of raupō stems were then wrapped around the ball and tied off around the cord, forming the covering . The other end of the cord was often decorated with a mukamuka, a tassel made from muka formed around a smaller knot. Occasionally, smaller tassels called poi piu were affixed to the base of the poi ball. Construction and design varied widely depending on regional, tribal, and personal preferences.\n\nAnother variety of poi is poi tāniko. In this construction, the outer shell was made of finely woven muka using a pattern based on a fishing net; these poi sometimes included strands that were dyed yellow to form a diamond pattern known as Te Karu ō te Atua (the Eye of God).\n\nIn the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, a cottage industry developed from the manufacture of raupō poi for sale to tourists, especially in the Rotorua area. Tourist-friendly variations included miniature poi that could be worn in buttonholes and as earrings.\n\nTraditional raupō poi are less likely to be used by modern poi artists since traditional materials wear quickly with frequent use. Also, flax and raupō are becoming increasingly difficult to find as the wetlands where they are naturally found have been drained or made into conservation reserves (although traditional harvesting is, generally, allowed by law).\n\nToday, most performance poi are made from durable and readily available modern materials. Cores are often made of foam or crumpled paper, while skins consist of plastic or loomed fabrics, such as tulle. Tassels are usually made of wool.\n\nModern poi coexists with traditional Maori poi and enjoys a broader, worldwide audience.\n\nTraditional Maori poi is generally performed in group choreography at cultural events, with vocal and musical accompaniment. By contrast, modern poi is generally performed by individuals, without singing and with less structured choreography. The tools and styles used are more varied. Many people first encounter poi in the form of fire spinning, but fire spinning is just one form of this highly varied art.\n\nModern poi borrows significantly from other physical arts, including various schools of dance and many object manipulation arts. Poi is practiced around the world and can often be seen at large festivals like Burning Man, European Juggling Convention.\n\nUnlike many physical arts, learning poi does not usually involve formal education. Most spinners learn from each other or teach themselves using DVDs or online resources. A strong sense of community and self-teaching are key elements of modern poi.\n\nBeginners often learn using a simple pair of practice poi, which are typically constructed from soft materials such as socks or stockings that are weighted with soft household objects such as bean bags, juggling balls, balloons filled with legumes, or small toys. Simple poi can also be constructed from tennis balls and lengths of rope.\n\nMore advanced practice poi models can include swivels (for orbital-type tricks), weighted handles (for tosses), or incorporate contact stage balls to enable the spinner to execute contact poi moves (i.e., rolls and fishtails).\n\nPerformers often use poi with bright, contrasting colors to enhance aesthetics and emphasize patterns. Some performance poi also incorporate tails or streamers for visual effect.\n\nPoi can be performed in the dark to dramatic effect when spinners use poi containing a light source, such as UV-sensitive materials, LED lights, or chemical glow sticks. Glowstringing, or using glowsticks swung from shoelaces, is popular at festivals and raves. It is also noted that while poi focuses on the manipulation of the head (the other side of the cord/chain from where you are holding), glowstringing focuses on the manipulation of the cord.\n\nMeteor were cross-adapted from poi and from a Chinese martial arts weapon called the meteor hammer. The meteor is often constructed similar to poi, or can actually be made using poi. The meteor, however, also incorporates an additional short chain, rope, or bar in the center. This format means that most poi skills will translate to meteor, plus some staff, rope dart and chain whip skills as well.\n\nFire poi use wicks made from kevlar or Technora or another flame resistant material for the weighted ends. The wicks are soaked in fuel, set on fire, and then spun for dramatic effect.\n\nA scientific study conducted by Kate Riegle van West at the University of Auckland showed significant improvements in grip strength, balance, and attention after one month of poi practice. She and others in various countries are working with poi as a therapeutic intervention and helping organisations implement poi wellbeing programmes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1968197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968197", "title": "Zhang Lu (Han dynasty)", "text": "Zhang Lu (Han dynasty)\n\nZhang Lu () (died 216), courtesy name Gongqi, was a government official, warlord and religious leader who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He was the third leader of the Celestial Masters, a Taoist religious group. He controlled a state in the Hanzhong region, which he had named Hanning () until 215, when he surrendered to Cao Cao, whom he would serve until his death one year later.\n\nUpon the death of his father, Zhang Heng (), Zhang Lu inherited control of the Celestial Masters religious group, and therefore became its third leader (the first was Zhang Lu's grandfather Zhang Daoling). The religion enjoyed its greatest popularity in Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), but when Zhang Lu took control of the group, it was being challenged in the area by a shamanistic religion led by Zhang Xiu (, no family relation to Zhang Lu).\n\nAgainst this background, both Zhang Lu and Zhang Xiu were abruptly ordered by Liu Yan to go together to attack Su Gu (), the Han-appointed administrator of Hanzhong Commandery and take over his territory. However, having his own designs, Zhang Lu killed Zhang Xiu and took command of his troops and religious followers before he went off for the campaign against Hanzhong. He successfully managed to defeat Su Gu, and upon taking control of Hanzhong, renamed the region Hanning (), ruling it by the principles of his religion. It is worth noting that although he nominally followed the orders of Liu Yan, when Liu Zhang succeeded him many years later, Zhang Lu refused to follow Liu Zhang's orders. As a result, Liu Zhang ordered the execution of Zhang Lu's mother, younger brothers and many other family members.\n\nIt is said that Zhang Lu's rule over his territory was for its time very humane and civilised. Roads were built throughout the territory with rest stops and foods provided free of charge. The taxes and donations taken from the people were not to be used for amusement, but instead for the support of the common people. In addition, under his leadership was a powerful army and strong defences such that neither Cao Cao nor Li Jue could easily defeat him. The Han central government recognised Zhang Lu's authority over Hanzhong Commandery and appointed him as General of the Household Who Guards Civilians () and the Administrator of Hanning (). According to the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\", Zhang Lu received a jeweled seal from the common people of his realm, which was a sign from Heaven that he was to become a king. Many of his subordinates urged him to declare himself king, but his adviser Yan Pu () warned that to do so would bring disaster. Zhang Lu heeded Yan Pu's advice.\n\nIn 211, Zhong Yao suggested to the warlord Cao Cao, who was the \"de facto\" head of the Han central government, to launch an invasion of Hanzhong Commandery. Cao Cao heeded his advice and mobilised his forces. However, the warlords Ma Chao and Han Sui, who were based in the Guanzhong region in between Cao Cao's territories and Hanzhong Commandery, thought that Cao Cao wanted to attack them so they started a revolt against the Han central government, leading to the Battle of Tong Pass and subsequent battles. Although Cao Cao's forces emerged victorious against the Guanzhong warlords, they were in no condition to continue attacking Hanzhong Commandery so they retreated. Ma Chao escaped to Hanzhong Commandery after his defeat and pledged allegiance to Zhang Lu, who considered marrying his daughter to him. However, a subordinate of Zhang Lu's, Yang Bo (), said, \"A man like that, who has no love for even his parents (referring to the execution of Ma Teng caused by Ma Chao's rebellion), cannot love another.\" and the marriage proposal was scrapped. Ma Chao then borrowed soldiers from Zhang Lu and attempted to regain some of his lost territory from Cao Cao, but was ultimately unsuccessful. His failures caused the relationship between the two to sour. When Liu Bei's forces had surrounded Liu Zhang, Ma Chao chose this time to leave Hanzhong Commandery with his own followers and join Liu Bei. Ma Chao's subordinate Pang De, however, remained in Zhang Lu's service.\n\nIn 215, Cao Cao again launched a campaign to conquer Hanzhong Commandery. Initially, Zhang Lu had no hope of standing against Cao Cao's armies, and planned to surrender. His younger brother Zhang Wei (), however, insisted on fighting and lead his army against the invading forces. He was soon killed in battle, and again Zhang Lu considered surrendering. His adviser Yan Pu, told him that surrendering so easily, they would have no position to negotiate from. Instead, Zhang Lu retreated to his fortress at Bazhong (). When leaving his capital, he did not destroy his wealth and treasures, nor attempt to take them with him, instead leaving them behind saying \"These things belong to the country, not to me.\" Cao Cao was greatly impressed by this, and sent a messenger to Zhang Lu asking him to surrender. Yan Pu's plan was successful, as Zhang Lu and his forces were warmly welcomed by Cao Cao. Cao Cao appointed Zhang Lu as General who Guards the South () and enfeoffed his five sons as marquises. Zhang Lu also married his daughter to Cao Yu, one of Cao Cao's sons. When Cao Cao turned Ma Chao's son Ma Qiu () over to Zhang Lu, Zhang Lu personally killed Ma Qiu – most likely as revenge against Ma Chao's desertion.\n\nZhang Lu died in 216 and was honoured with the posthumous title \"Marquis Yuan\" () by the Han imperial court. His sons continued to lead the Five Pecks of Rice religion, which later evolved into the Taoist religion known as Zhengyi Dao.\n\nIn the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", Zhang Lu is portrayed as strongly craving the title of King of Hanning, and attempting to aggressively expand his territory. In the novel, he attempts to invade Liu Zhang's Yi Province, only to be stopped. When Ma Chao left his service, he sent a servant Yang Bo () along to spy on him. However, when Ma Chao joined Liu Bei, he killed Yang Bo.\n\n\n"}

He began his career as a documentary director and television comedy writer before transitioning into features in the early 1980s. His best-known credits include the 1984 film adaptation of George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" starring John Hurt and Richard Burton (in his final role), the Shakespeare adaptation \"The Merchant of Venice,\" the true crime drama \"White Mischief,\" and the 1994 Italian-language comedy drama \",\" for which he won the BAFTA Awards for Best Direction and Best Film Not in the English Language, and earned Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nRadford was born on 24 February 1946, in New Delhi, India, to a British father and an Austrian Jewish mother. He was educated at Bedford School before attending Worcester College, Oxford. After teaching for a few years, he went to the National Film and Television School, becoming a student there in its inaugural year.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1982, Radford worked as a documentary film maker, mostly on projects for the BBC, covering subjects such as Scottish islanders on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides who believe in the literal truth of the Bible: \"The Last Stronghold of the Pure Gospel\"; the soprano Isobel Buchanan: \"La Belle Isobel\"; the singer songwriter Van Morrison: \"Van Morrison in Ireland\"; and the self-explanatory \"The Making of The Pirates of Penzance\". On the last two of these Radford worked with the cinematographer Roger Deakins, who would later shoot two of Radford's feature films; \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" and \"White Mischief\". Another notable early work was \"Another Time, Another Place\" (1983), a feature film set in Scotland during World War II and centered on a love story between a local woman and an Italian POW.\n\nRadford came to international attention with \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", his adaptation of George Orwell's novel \"1984\", starring John Hurt as Winston Smith, and in which Richard Burton gave his final film performance. The film was made in the time and place (London, April–June 1984) at which the book was set.\n\nRadford's next film, released in 1987, was \"White Mischief\", a period drama set in Kenya during the 1940s. Radford again wrote the screenplay, an adaptation of the novel by James Fox also called \"White Mischief\".\n\nMichael Radford is most widely known as the writer and director of the 1994 film \"\", which Radford adapted from the novel \"Ardiente Paciencia\" by Antonio Skármeta. The massive international success of the film (for many years it was the largest grossing non-English language film ever made) led to international acclaim for Radford and the star of the film Massimo Troisi. Tragically Troisi died, aged 41, the day after the filming of \"Il Postino\" was completed. The film won many international film awards including the 'Best Film Not In The English Language' BAFTA for Radford, who was also nominated for the Best Director and Adapted Screenplay Academy Awards.\n\nIn 2000, Radford's film \"Dancing at the Blue Iguana\" was released. In a departure from his more usual development technique, namely adapting novels, this film was largely improvised, although Radford shared the screenwriting credit with David Linter.\n\nIn 2004, Radford directed \"The Merchant of Venice\" (2004). He adapted the William Shakespeare play (see: Shakespearean comedies), and the film stars Al Pacino as Shylock and Jeremy Irons as Antonio. In 2007, he reunited Demi Moore and Michael Caine (who had already been together in 1984 for \"Blame it on Rio\") in \"Flawless\", a diamond heist story set in 1960. His most recent film is \"Elsa & Fred\" (2014), a romantic comedy starring Shirley MacLaine and Christopher Plummer.\n\nRadford directed his first play in 2000, a West End production of \"The Seven Year Itch\". This was an adaptation of Billy Wilder's 1955 film starring Marilyn Monroe.\n\nRadford has a son Felix (born 1991) from his first marriage to Iseult Teran. He also has a daughter Amaryllis (born 2005), and a son Linus (born 2010), with his current wife Emma Tweed.\n\nIn addition to English (his first language), he speaks fluent Spanish, French, Italian, and some Mandarin.\n\nIn September 2013, he took part in the Clipper Round the World Sailing Race, in which he raced one of 12 identical 70 foot racing yachts from London to Rio.\n"}

Co-written by Glitter and Mike Leander, the song is in two parts: Part 1 is a vocal track reflecting on the history of the genre, and Part 2 is a mostly instrumental piece. Both parts were popular in Britain, and the single went to No. 2 on the British charts. In concert, Glitter merged both into one performance. \n\n\"Rock and Roll\" is Glitter's only top 10 hit in the U.S. It was also in North America that the \"Part 2\" became popularly associated with sports, as a number of professional teams began to play the song during games to invigorate the audience. Since Glitter's convictions for child sex offences, the song's continued use has been controversial.\n\nIn the UK, \"Rock and Roll\" was one of over 25 hit singles for Glitter. In the US, the instrumental version (Part 2) attracted most of the attention; it hit No. 7 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The running time of the US mono 45, which is mixed different from the LP, is 3:10 whilst it is 2:58 on the US LP. In France, \"Part 1\" was the successful side, peaking at number one.\n\nIn North America, \"Part 2\" became popularly associated with sports, as a number of professional teams adopted the song for use during games, primarily to signify scores and victories, or to otherwise invigorate the crowd. It is often referred to as \"The 'Hey' Song,\" as the only intelligible word in Part 2 is the exclamation of \"Hey,\" punctuating the end of several instrumental phrases and repeated three times at the song's chorus. At sporting events, fans often insert their own \"Hey,\" or sometimes other chanted syllables.\nIt was played first in a sport setting in 1974 at games for the Kalamazoo Wings of the high-minor International Hockey League by Kevin O'Brien, the team's public relations and marketing director. When he went to work for the NHL's Colorado Rockies in 1976, he brought the song with him. After the Rockies moved to New Jersey as the New Jersey Devils in 1982, the Denver Nuggets and Denver Broncos picked up the tradition and were the first NBA and NFL teams to play the song during games.\n\nIn 1999, Glitter was convicted of downloading child pornography in England, and in 2006 of child sexual abuse charges in Vietnam. After the second conviction was upheld in court, the NFL asked teams to stop playing the song. Glitter was dismayed by this result as he is a fan of the San Diego Chargers and had choreographed some of the team's cheerleading cadences in 1989. The NFL allowed a cover version of the song by the Tube Tops 2000 to be played, but in 2012, the NFL instructed teams to \"avoid\" the song following negative reaction from British media to the New England Patriots' use of the song. The New Jersey Devils replaced the song in 2013, with the team stating that it wished to create a more positive in-arena atmosphere (alluding to a chant of \"Hey, you suck!\", done in time to the song by fans). In 2014, \"Billboard\" reported that the song was slowly falling out of favour due to both the controversies, and teams electing to replace it with newer songs.\n\n\"Rock and Roll Part 2\" was used for \"Sudden Death\", both in a trailer and the actual film. In the latter, the song can be heard from the Civic Arena's audio system whenever the Pittsburgh Penguins score a goal, much like what happened in real games at the time. \n\nIt is on the soundtrack of the 1997 comedy-drama \"The Full Monty\".

The AOC was created in 1936. It is shared between the two communes of Chambolle-Musigny (where the main part is located) and Morey-Saint-Denis in the Côte-d'Or département. Bonnes Mares is located a little to the north of the Chambolle-Musigny village, and borders the Route des Grands Crus in the east and the Grand Cru vineyard Clos de Tart in the north.\n\nIn 2008, of vineyard surface was in production within the AOC, and 522 hectoliter of wine was produced, corresponding to 70,000 bottles.\n\nThe origin of the vineyard's name is unknown, although it is known to have been used since the High Medieval period, and at least three different hypotheses exist. The most commonly prevailing assumption is that it may come from the \"bonnes mères\" (\"good mothers\"), nuns of the Cistercian order at Notre-Dame de Tart. A second hypothesis holds that it originates in the verb \"marer\", to cultivate, which would give a translation of \"good vintage\". The third hypothesis, favored by the Drouhin family, is based on the myth of a winegrower who is said to have unearthed in this vineyard a sculpture representing three goddesses of fecundity, the \"bonnes mères\".\n\nThe main grape variety for Bonnes Mares is Pinot Noir. The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes, but this is practically never used for any Burgundy Grand Cru vineyard. The allowed base yield is 35 hectoliter per hectare, a minimum planting density of 9,000 vines per hectare is required as well as a minimum grape maturity of 11.5 per cent potential alcohol.\n\nThe style of Bonnes Mares wine is in general full-bodied and tannic. A difference in soil types over the length of the vineyard is often reflected in the style of wines, which can be either more in the style of Morey-Saint-Denis wine or in the style of Chambolle-Musigny wine, meaning lighter and more elegant.\n\n"}

According to the Drutsk Gospel, the town was built around one of the oldest Christian churches in White Ruthenia erected in 1001.\n\nIn the 12th century and 13th century it was a centre of the early medieval Principality of Druck, ruled by the dukes of the Polatsk branch of the Rurikid dynasty. Since the 13th century there is only limited information about the town available in the chronicles.\n\nIn 1524 Drutsk has been burned down by Russians in a war and started to lose its political importance. Exact time and reasons of the town's decline are unknown. Historians estimate the period of decline to between the 15th and 17th centuries.\n\nArchaeological researches state that Drutsk has been an important military fortress for some period of time. Until the mid 17th century it had a castle. Both the castle and the town have been destroyed and rebuilt for several times.\n\nAccording to the German ambassador of the 17th century Johann Georg Korb, in the 16th century Drutsk was a large city that had about two hundred churches but that was then entirely destroyed in a war. Therefore Korb compared the city with Troy.\n\nThe town is also the name-sake of the Drucki-Lubecki and Druckoy-Sokolinski noble families and the name-sake for their coat of arms, the Druck Coat of Arms. The most famous member of those families is Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki.\n\n"}
