{"id": "2146448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146448", "title": "Pauldron", "text": "Pauldron\n\nA pauldron (sometimes spelled \"pouldron\" or \"powldron\") is a component of plate armor that evolved from spaulders in the 15th century. As with spaulders, pauldrons cover the shoulder area. Pauldrons tend to be larger than spaulders, covering the armpit, and sometimes parts of the back and chest. A pauldron typically consists of a single large dome-shaped piece to cover the shoulder (the \"cop\") with multiple lames attached to it, to defend the arm and upper shoulder. On some suits of armour, especially those of Italian design, the pauldrons would usually be asymmetrical, with one pauldron covering less (for mobility) and sporting a cut-away to make room for a lance rest.\n\nThe pauldron of a knight was also important in jousts. While the most points in a jousting competition were scored by unhorsing the opponent or striking the lance, points could also be scored if a lance was to hit the enemy pauldron, albeit for lesser points than a true strike. Many pauldron styles made use of a lance rest to assist in the joust, allowing the knight an area to ready the lance for stronger blows. The pauldron would typically be cut shorter to allow for this rest, without restricting the arm mobility or the protection of the rider. Typically only the right pauldron would support this cut-away, as this was the lance arm of the knights contending in a joust.\n\nTypical tournament armor for jousting would be padded with cloth to minimize injury from an opponent's lance and prevent the metal of the pauldron from scraping against the breastplate. This protective cloth padding would extend about half an inch from the rolled edge of the armor, and it was secured in place with rivets along the entire edge. In battle, this cloth protection could not be too thick, else the knight would have no arm mobility. However, in a safer tournament setting, mobility was less important compared to safety, thus leading to heavier padding. In fact, knights in this era could be padded to the point where they look \"more wide than tall\", as compared with contemporary depictions of jousting armor.\n\nPlate pauldrons tend to be found as a common armor type in many fantasy or science fiction worlds. This can be done for in-world reasons such as denoting a character's rank or culture, or merely due to aesthetic reasons by the artist. A well-known example of this is in the \"Star Wars\" universe, where colors of the pauldrons may denote a clone or stormtrooper's rank or role. An orange-colored pauldron is used to identify a stormtrooper officer, compared to the plain white of the regular forces. Additionally, a White pauldron denotes a sergeant or similar-ranked soldier. The pauldron in The Mandalorian's first episode is the first upgrade made to the Mandalorian's armor in the series and a legacy of Boba Fett's original armor. Another more aesthetic example would be the space marines from the \"Warhammer 40,000\" universe, famous for their strong builds and oversized armor. These massive armor pieces it seems would be used both for deflection of enemy fire and housing important components to the exoskeleton as a whole.\n"}

{"id": "2146451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146451", "title": "Jet Moto 3", "text": "Jet Moto 3\n\nJet Moto 3 was released exclusively for the PlayStation video game console on August 31, 1999. It was the first and only \"Jet Moto\" title released by developer Locomotive Games and publisher 989 Sports. It has been released only in North America. It was released on the PlayStation Network on February 21, 2008 but was removed shortly thereafter for undisclosed reasons.\n\nThe game received moderately positive reviews, averaging 75.75% at video game aggregate site GameRankings. Reviewers generally praised the game's visuals, considering them an improvement over the previous installments. \"Jet Moto 3\" would be the last title to date in the \"Jet Moto series\". Two additional sequels, \"Jet Moto 2124\" and \"\" were cancelled during development.\n\nGameplay in \"Jet Moto 3\" differs from that of a traditional racing game with cars or motorcycles. Players instead control hoverbikes which sit close to the ground and can be ridden over land and water. Most of the courses in the game are designed to take advantage of this ability. Characters are split into teams, and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew and Doritos, similar to real-life sponsored racing.\n\nTen characters are available from the beginning of the game with two more unlockable. This \"Jet Moto\" is notable for the inclusion of new stunt tracks. The objective of these tracks is to perform stunts to gain higher points and to collect coins scattered throughout the track. Another notable inclusion is the \"hop\" button, which is used to boost your player above the ground to avoid obstacles.\n\nThe physics of the jet moto bikes were also changed, with the bikes reaching much higher speed than the two previous games. Weather was also introduced into the series, with jet moto riders racing in the rain and in other weathered environments. Track themes vary greatly, with tracks taking places in volcanic islands, catacombs, the heights of Machu Pichu, and a thick Sequoia forest.\n\n\"Jet Moto 3\" would be the first and only released \"Jet Moto\" title by developer Pacific Coast Power & Light and publisher 989 Sports. SingleTrac had been purchased by GT Interactive, and the original developers had no interest in doing a third \"Jet Moto\" title. According to former 989 Sports president Kelly Flock, Pacific Coast Power & Light was \"nearby and cheap\" and was headed by Don Traeger, who had formerly worked on the Road Rash series, so the decision was made to use that studio for development.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, the game supported the DualShock Controller. The previous game only supported the Dual Analog controller with Rumble feedback. The \"Jet Moto 3\" graphics engine and developer toolkit were built from the ground up by lead programmer Ming Lee. Lee was challenged to increase the framerate and graphic quality of the game. To do so he decomposed the opcodes of the PlayStation's graphics processor and rewrote some of the PlayStation's library calls. This in essence allowed Lee to access the PlayStation hardware as he saw fit, allowing him to optimize his code specifically to his hardware calls. In doing so, however, the developers broke compatibility with first generation PlayStation consoles, something that was not caught until after the game was released. Fellow programmer Matt Gaston focused his energies on AI, physics and user interface programming.\n\nWith programming optimizations in place, developers were able to use the additional power to add weather effects previously unheard of. Lee noted in an interview with PlayStation Museum that rain particles \"actually streak in 3D according to your camera speed\", noting that other games used a 2D effect on the game's HUD to produce the effect of rain. Colored fog was also shown in one level, something that the PlayStation console could not do natively, and had only previously been seen in one game, Spyro the Dragon. Real time lighting was also added to the game. \"Jet Moto 3\" would also use CGI cutscenes for the game's introduction, a first for the \"Jet Moto\" series. It was released on the PlayStation Network on February 21, 2008 but was removed shortly thereafter for undisclosed reasons.\n\n\"Jet Moto 3\" was fairly well received, averaging 75.75% at gaming aggregate site GameRankings. It ranked tenth in the top ten racing titles for June 2000 according to the NPD Group, however sales did not continue to hold strong.\n\nDoug Trueman reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"In a season with relatively new worthwhile PlayStation racing games, \"Jet Moto 3\" proves to be fast, furious racing fun.\"\n\nReviewers were mixed on the opinion of the game's visuals. Game Revolution called the graphics \"a vast improvement over the grainy, somewhat choppy visuals of Jet Moto and Jet Moto 2.\" IGN also praised the \"Jet Moto 3\"s visuals, citing a vastly improved framerate and draw distance than \"Jet Moto\" and \"Jet Moto 2\". GameSpot, however felt the graphical details were poor, citing that the game's environments were \"nice and pretty unless you get too close.\" The CGI cutscenes were also panned by GameSpot, calling it \"frightful\" and stating \"none of the characters look even fractionally human.\"\n\nGame Informer praised the new stunt tracks, stating that they \"will capture hours of your playtime.\" Electric Playground spoke highly of the game's soundtrack, stating that the varied types of music fit each track's location and environment. They further praised \"Jet Moto 3\" as superior to the other titles, calling the first two games \"notoriously bug-ridden.\" The \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\" said the opposite, giving the game 3/10, while the previous game received 8/10.\n\n\"Jet Moto 3\" would be the last game in the series to be released publicly. 989 Studios and Pacific Coast Power & Light were also working on a fourth \"Jet Moto\" title, dubbed \"Jet Moto 2124\" for the PlayStation, however the game was cancelled when \"Jet Moto 3\" showed poor sales. \"Jet Moto 2124\" was to be set over a century after the first three games. \"\", developed by RedZone Interactive, was also cancelled. \"SOLAR\" would have been the first title in the series to appear on the PlayStation 2.\n"}
{"id": "2146454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146454", "title": "Media preservation", "text": "Media preservation\n\nPreservation of documents, pictures, recordings, digital content, etc., is a major aspect of archival science. It is also an important consideration for people who are creating time capsules, family history, historical documents, scrapbooks and family trees. Common storage media are not permanent, and there are few reliable methods of preserving documents and pictures for the future.\n\nColor negatives and ordinary color prints may fade away to nothing in a relatively short period if not stored and handled properly. This happens even if the negatives and prints are kept in the dark, because ambient light is not the determining factor, but heat and humidity are. The color degradation is the result of the dyes used in the color processes. Because color processing results in a less stable image than traditional black-and-white processing, black-and-white pictures from the 1920s are more likely to survive long-term than color films and photographs from after the middle 20th century.\n\nBlack-and-white photographic films using silver halide emulsions are the only film types that have proven to last for archival storage. The determining factors for longevity include the film base type, proper processing (develop, stop, fix and wash) and proper storage. Early films used a Cellulose nitrate base which was prone to decomposition and highly flammable. Nitrate film was replaced with acetate-base films. These Cellulose acetate films were later discovered to outgass acids (also referred to as vinegar syndrome). Acetate films were replaced in the early 1980s by polyester film base materials which have been determined to be more stable than film stocks with a nitrate or acetate base.\n\nColor prints made on most inkjet printers look very good at first but they have a very short lifespan, measured in months rather than in years. Even prints from commercial photo labs will start to fade in a matter of years if not processed properly and stored in cool, dry environments.\n\nWith documents for which the media are not so critical as what the documents contain, the information in documents can be copied by using photocopiers and image scanners. Books and manuscripts can also have their information saved without destruction by using a book scanner.\n\nWhere the medium itself needs to be preserved, for example if a document is a crayon sketch by a famous artist on paper, a complex process of preservation may be used. Depending on the condition and importance of the item this can include gluing the media onto more stable media, or protective enclosing of the media. Polyester sleeves, acid-free folders, and pH buffered document boxes are common supportive protective enclosures whose selection must match the media's chemical and physical properties. Other considerations in preserving paper/books are:\n\nAlthough there are many websites that allow the upload of photographs and videos, digital preservation for the long-term is still an issue. There is a lack of confidence that such websites are capable of storing data for long periods of time (ex. 50 years) without data degradation or loss.\n\nWrite-once optical media, such as CD-Rs and DVD-Rs, contain an organic dye that distinguishes data reading from data writing based on the dye's transparency along the disk. Conventional CDs and DVDs have finite shelf-life due to natural degradation of the dye; the newer M-DISC uses different technology to produce DVDs with a claimed lifespan of up to 1000 years. The National Archives and Records Administration lists published life expectancies to be 10 or 25 years or more for normal CDs and DVDs and conservative life expectancies to be between 2 and 5 years. Storage environments, such as temperature and humidity, as well as handling conditions such as frequency of media use and compatibility between the recorder and media, affect media shelf-life. Improvements in media storage and migrations to new recording technologies can make certain formats obsolete within their respective lifespan. Technologists have pointed to internet streaming media, where services such as video-on-demand have contributed to the 33 percent decline in DVD sales the past 5 years, as a challenge for digital preservation.\n\nMagnetic media such as audio and video tape and floppy disks also have limited life spans.\n\nAudio and video tapes require specific care and handling to ensure that the recorded information will be preserved. For information that must be preserved indefinitely, periodic transcription from old media to new ones is necessary, not only because the media are unstable but also because the recording technology may become obsolete.\n\nMagnetic media also deteriorates naturally with typical shelf lives between 10 and 20 years. Magnetic tape can degrade from binder hydrolysis or magnetic remanence decay. Binder hydrolysis, also known as sticky-shed syndrome, refers to the breakdown of binder, or glue, that holds the magnetic particles to the polyester base of the tape. Tapes which have been stored in hot, humid conditions are particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon and may suffer from accelerated degradation. Severe binder can cause the magnetic material to fall off or sheds from the base, leaving a pile of dust and clear backing. Archivists can bake the tape, which evaporates water molecules on the tape, to temporarily restore the binder before making a copy.\n\nMagnetic tape can also be destabilized by magnetic remanence decay, which refers to the weakening of the tape's magnetization over time. This weakens the affect tape's readability, leading to reduced sound clarity and volume or picture hue and contrast. Baking the tape will not restore magnetization. Archivists might instead digitally encode a copy of the tape, preserving its content as a digital data file.\n\nMedia at risk include recorded media such as master audio recordings of symphonies and videotape recordings of the news gathered over the last 40 years. Threats to media that must be considered when archiving important record media include accidental erasure, physical loss due to disasters such as fires and floods, and media degradation.\n\nAlong with the actual media being degraded over the years, the machines that are available to play back or reproduce the audio sources are becoming archaic themselves. Manufacturers and their support (parts, technical updates) for their machines have disappeared throughout the years. Even if the medium is vaulted and archived correctly, the mechanical properties of the machines have deteriorated to the point that they could do more harm than good to the tape being played.\n\nMany major film studios are now backing up their libraries by converting them to electronic media files, such as .AIFF or .WAV-based files via digital audio workstations. That way, even if the digital platform manufacturer goes out of business or no longer supports their product, the files can still be played on any common computer.\n\nThere is a detailed process that must take place previous to the final archival product now that a digital solution is in place. Sample rates and their conversion and reference speed are both critical in this process.\n\nIn floppy disks, the lubricants inside the plastic jackets of many older floppies promote the decay of the magnetic medium. Also, the alignment of the magnetic particles of the disk substrate may gradually degrade, leading to a loss of formatting and data. Early laser disk media were prone to degradation as the layers of the disk substrate were bonded with an adhesive that was vulnerable to decay and would crumble over time. This would lead the different layers of the disk to peel apart, damaging the pitted data surface and rendering the disk unreadable.\n\n"}
{"id": "2146458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146458", "title": "The King of Fighters '95", "text": "The King of Fighters '95\n\nThe game features a similar cast to \"KOF '94\" with the exception of the USA Team, which was replaced by the Rival Team. The plot features a new King of Fighters tournament once again promoted by the criminal Rugal Bernstein, who wants to take revenge against Kyo Kusanagi, who defeated him in last year's tournament. The game also introduces a sub-boss character, Saisyu Kusanagi, who is the father of Kyo. \"KOF '95\" also introduces the fighter Iori Yagami, who becomes Kyo's rival in the series.\n\nOne of the main focuses in the creation of \"The King of Fighters '95\" was the introduction of the Rivals Team, most notably Iori, who became one of the favorite characters from the staff. The game has received mixed reviews from various video games publications. Most writers have complained about the response from controls and long loading times from the PlayStation port. However, the introduction from the enhanced version of Rugal, Omega Rugal, as well as the differences between all the characters have been noted to be one of the best parts from the game.\n\nThe gameplay and rules are mostly unchanged from \"The King of Fighters '94\". The main addition is the introduction of the Team Edit feature, allowing the player to create a custom team from any of the game's twenty-four characters in addition to the pre-defined teams in the game. Through the main play mode, players must defeat all of the teams from the game in order to fight the bosses: the brainwashed Saisyu Kusanagi, followed by a stronger Rugal Bernstein.\n\n\"The King of Fighters '95\" marks the beginning of a story arc that later became known as the \"Orochi Saga\". However, the only elements from the Orochi Saga known in this game is the introduction of Kyo's rival, Iori Yagami, and Rugal's use of the Orochi power.\n\nRugal Bernstein, thought to have perished in an explosion in the previous game, had in fact survived and sent out invitations to the teams from the previous game signed simply ‘R'. Only one of the previous teams failed to attend the new tournament: the American Sports Team, now replaced by the \"Rival Team\" consisting of Iori Yagami, Billy Kane (from \"\"), and Eiji Kisaragi (from \"Art of Fighting 2\"). Saisyu Kusanagi, Kyo's father, appears as a fighter for the first time (having made a non-playable cameo in \"KOF '94\") as a computer-controlled sub-boss character. After defeating Saisyu in the arcade mode, it is revealed that Saisyu was being brainwashed and that Rugal will fight once again as a boss character, but as an enhanced version named \"Omega Rugal\".\n\nThe \"KOF '95\" project began with the concept of introducing Iori Yagami as Kyo Kusanagi's rival. As such, developers gave him traits to expand that relationship such as similar abilities and ancient rivalry between both of their clans. During the initial location tests to determine the popularity of the game, Iori was the character who stood out most, also becoming a favorite of the developers. The creation of the Rival Team was one of the things developers worked the hardest, focusing in their moves and lines. The character of Eiji Kisaragi was originally from \"Art of Fighting 2\" and the staff had to adjust most of his moves to balance him with the other characters. Following this game, several \"Art of Fighting\" characters were removed from each sequel with developers saying it was \"thanks to KOF jinx.\" The sub-boss character, Saisyu Kusanagi, was never meant to appear in the game as the staff wanted to make so that he died in \"The King of Fighters '94\" during one of the cut-scenes from the Hero Team. However, Saisyu was added at the last moment to the game, becoming the sub-boss character. \"Fatal Fury\" boss character Geese Howard was meant to be playable in the game; various considerations at the time, however, led developers to abandon this plan.\n\n\"The King of Fighters '95\" was one of the first titles from SNK to be ported to the Sony PlayStation system. Chad Okada, a former member from SNK, mentioned it was one of his first works. He commented that he had to improve its marketability to the North American market. As a result, he added new options to the game that were not present in the original Japanese version such as selection from stages and improve the grammar and spelling, which was one of the biggest issues from the Neo Geo version.\n\nThe original Japanese arcade version was released on July 25, 1995 and it was ported to the Neo Geo and Neo-Geo CD later that year. A port of the Neo Geo release was added to Wii's Virtual Console service on April 26, 2010. It is slightly edited, however; the blood is removed and Mai lacks her signature bounce, both in her fighting stance and win animation. Both of these aspects can be activated with a code, however.\n\nIn 1996, the game was ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The PlayStation version was published on August 31, 1996 in North America and the PAL region by Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.. It featured a remixed soundtrack which took advantage of the Redbook audio format. The Saturn version (which required a ROM cartridge that came packaged with the game disc) was also released in Europe by Sega. The bundled ROM cartridge contains the majority of the character animations. It was the first video game to use a CD-ROM and a ROM cartridge in tandem. The PlayStation version appeared in Europe ahead of the Saturn version due to a timed exclusivity deal between SNK and Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. The \"Playstation the Best\" version was also re-released on March 28, 1997. It was also compiled in \"The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga\" in 2008 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii.\n\nA Game Boy game based on \"The King of Fighters '95\" (\"Nettō The King of Fighters '95\" in Japan) was published by Takara in Japan and by Nintendo in North America. It featured compatibility with the Super Game Boy, as well as introducing Nakoruru from the \"Samurai Shodown\" series as a secret character.\n\nThe game received a variety of licensed media released in Japan in 1994–1995:\n\n\"The King of Fighters '95\" was awarded Best Neo-Geo Game of 1995 by \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" in 1996. During its release week, the Sega Saturn port of the game sold 135,214 copies in Japan. As of 2004, the game remained with 257,294 copies sold.\n\nThe four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" declared the Neo Geo AES version a solid improvement over the previous \"King of Fighters\", particularly applauding the addition of the team edit feature. Major Mike of \"GamePro\" agreed that this was the game's best feature, but also expressed approval for the replacement of the U.S. team with the new \"Rival\" team and the control modifications. He did criticize that the game \"didn't improve '94's graphics, it just added to them\", but concluded \"King of Fighters '95\" to be \"one of the best brawlers out there\". A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" was unimpressed, however, remarking that \"The idea behind fighting as a three-person team ... adds an interesting flare to the game, but the final result is still a one-on-one fighting game with nothing much new to offer the seasoned fighter.\"\n\nReviewing the Neo Geo CD version, \"Maximum\" deemed that \"SNK remain masters of the sprite-based one-on-one fighting genre, leaving all competitors way behind with \"King of Fighters '95\".\" They elaborated that the team combat makes for greater variety than the average fighting game, the team edit feature greatly increases the game's enjoyability and longevity, the unusually high difficulty of executing combos makes pulling them off more satisfying, and the animations are greatly improved from \"The King of Fighters '94\".\n\nThe PlayStation version, however, was much less well received, as reviewers stated it has poor design in comparison to other fighting games from the same year. IGN criticized that the characters are not very responsive to controls and \"even though these are difficult hurdles to jump, they're not impossible\". However, they noted it to be a likeable game, saying it has \"that 2D anime look that everyone loves\". A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" said that the PlayStation version compounded the game's lack of fresh and original gameplay with long load times. Jeff Gerstmann from \"GameSpot\" also criticized the long loading times from the PlayStation version as well as how frequent they are since every round requires loading time. Game Revolution noted the game to be very entertaining but still not as good as other fighting games from the year it was released in North America. They criticized that the fighting system is very similar to other SNK games such as \"Fatal Fury\" and \"Art of Fighting\". However, Scary Larry defended the PlayStation version in \"GamePro\", saying it \"plays well, looks good, and sounds the same as the arcade version. You could do worse.\" 1UP.com praised the introduction of Omega Rugal, noting him to be \"one of the most stylish boss designs in fighting history\", although players could hate him due to how difficult it is to defeat him.\n\nRich Leadbetter of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" stated that the Saturn port is nearly arcade perfect, the ROM cartridge enabling it to recreate the look of the arcade version with only brief load times. He found the level of skill and technique involved in the game to be both its strongest point and the main limiting factor on its appeal: \"SNK fans swear blind that \"King of Fighters\" is far superior to \"Street Fighter Alpha\" (and its sequel) simply because the element of skill required is that much tougher - making the rewards that much sweeter. The majority of us are unlikely to reach that pinnacle of skill ... but the fact is that if you're good enough, it remains one of the greatest fighting games of all time.\" He added that while \"The King of Fighters '96\" was already out for the Saturn in Japan, the two installments are different enough from each other that it is worth getting both.\n\nIGN commented that the characters' designs and abilities are very similar to the ones from \"Street Fighter Alpha\". Jeff Gerstmann complained that the characters have unattractive moves as well and over pixelated sprites. 1UP.com praised SNK's characters designs and the addition of the team edit option, making the game a good competition for \"Street Fighter Alpha\". However, Game Revolution liked the large number of playable characters and the several options featured in the game such as the team fights and special moves.\n\nGame designer Masahiro Sakurai regarded the game as one of his favorite competitive experiences when being young. However, after realizing he had been defeating rookies, Sakurai decided that fighting games should also be accessible to newcomers.\n\n"}
{"id": "2146459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146459", "title": "Apple Interactive Television Box", "text": "Apple Interactive Television Box\n\nThe Apple Interactive Television Box (AITB) is a television set-top box developed by Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) in partnership with a number of global telecommunications firms, including British Telecom and Belgacom. Prototypes of the unit were deployed at large test markets in parts of the United States and Europe in 1994 and 1995, but the product was canceled shortly thereafter, and was never mass-produced or marketed.\n\nThe AITB was designed as an interface between a consumer and an interactive television service. The unit's remote control would allow a user to choose what content would be shown on a connected television, and to seek with fast forward and rewind. In this regard it is similar to a modern satellite receiver or TiVo unit. The box would only pass along the user's choices to a central content server for streaming instead of issuing content itself. There were also plans for game shows, educational material for children, and other forms of content made possible by the interactive qualities of the device.\n\nEarly conceptual prototypes have an unfinished feel. Near-completion units have a high production quality, the internal components often lack prototype indicators, and some units have FCC approval stickers. These facts, along with a full online manual suggest the product was very near completion before being canceled.\n\nBecause the machine was designed to be part of a subscription data service, the AITB units are mostly inoperable. The ROM contains only what is required to continue booting from an external hard drive or from its Ethernet connection. Many of the prototypes do not appear to even attempt to boot. This is likely dependent on changes in the ROM. The ROM itself contains parts of a downsized Mac OS 7.1 enabling it to establish a network connection to the media servers provided by Oracle. The Oracle Media Server (OMS) initially ran on hardware produced by Larry Ellison's nCube Systems company, but was later also made available by Oracle on SGI, Alpha, Sun, SCO, Netware, Windows NT, and AIX systems. These servers also provided the parts of the OS not implemented in ROM of the AITB via the OMS Boot Service. Therefore, an AITB must establish a network connection successfully in order to finish the boot process. There have been cases of users entering in a command key combination, to get the AITB to boot off of a preinstalled System 7.1 on an external SCSI hard drive, using a PowerBook SCSI adapter (not a SCSI Disk Mode-enabled adapter, but one just for external hard drives).\n\nIn July 2016, images were published on a video game forum that appear to show a Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge designed to work with the British Telecom variant of the AITB. The cartridge is labeled \"BT GameCart\" and includes an 8-pin serial connector designed to connect to the Apple System/Peripheral 8 port on the rear of the box. A BT promotional film for the service trial discusses a way users could download and play Nintendo video games via the system.\n\nThe Apple Interactive Television Box is based upon the Macintosh Quadra 605 or LC 475. Because the box was never marketed, not all specifications have been stated by Apple. It supports MPEG-2 Transport containing ISO11172 (MPEG-1) bit streams, Apple Desktop Bus, RF in and out, S-Video out, RCA audiovideo out, RJ-45 connector for either E1 data stream on PAL devices or T1 data stream on NTSC devices, serial port, and HDI-30 SCSI. Apple intended to offer the AITB with a matching black ADB mouse, keyboard, Apple 300e CD-ROM drive, StyleWriter printer, and one of several styles of remote controls.\n\nThe hard drive contains parts of a regular North American Mac OS 7.1.1 with Finder, several sockets for network connection protocols, and customized MPEG1 decoding components for the QuickTime Player software.\n\nA few units contain a special boot ROM which allows the device to boot locally from a SCSI hard drive that has the OS and applications contained within the box; these devices were used primarily by developers inside Apple and Oracle, and for limited demonstration purposes. In normal network use, content and program code was served to the box by Oracle OMS over the network to implement the box's interactivity.\n\nA few hundred to a few thousand units were deployed at Disneyland California hotels and provided in room shopping and park navigation. Approximately 2500 units were installed and used in consumer homes in England during the second interactive television trial conducted by British Telecom and Oracle, which was in Ipswich, UK. The set-top applications were developed using Oracle's Oracle Media Objects (OMO) product, which is somewhat similar to HyperCard, but was enhanced significantly to operate in a network-based interactive TV environment.\n\n\n"}

Instead of charging the Power Gauge, the Power Gauge is now filled whenever the player strikes the opponent or by performing Special Moves. The player can stock up to three Power Gauges. The player can use one stock of the Power Gauge to perform a Super Special Move or enter a \"MAX\" mode, in which the players defensive and offensive strength are increased. Performing a Super Special Move while in MAX mode will make the player perform a more powerful Super Special Move.\n\nExtra mode is based on the first two games in the series, \"KOF '94\" and \"KOF '95\". Like in those games, the player fills the Power Gauge by charging it or defending against the opponents attacks. After the gauge is filled, the player enters MAX mode and like in Advanced, their character's offense and defense will increase. The player can only perform Super Special Moves in MAX mode or when the life gauge is near empty and flashing red. When the player performs a Super move in MAX mode while the life gauge is flashing red, then the Super move will be even more powerful. The Emergency Roll maneuver from \"KOF '96\" used in Advanced mode is replaced by the side-step from \"KOF '94\" and \"KOF '95\".\n\nDespite the events at the end of the previous game, the KOF tournament was a huge commercial success and sparked a worldwide fighting craze. Within a few months of the tournament ending, various large corporations had held smaller KOF tournament qualifiers and constructed special KOF stadiums around the world, building the excitement up for the next tournament. News of the tournament spread through every form of media and fans and new fighters from across the globe come to watch the preliminary matches.\n\nAll of the characters from the previous game return, with the exception of the Boss Team (which was disbanded after its first appearance), Kasumi Todoh (who went off to search for her father), and Mature and Vice (who were killed by Iori Yagami after he was possessed by the Riot of Blood at the conclusion of the previous game).\n\nChizuru Kagura, the sub-boss in the previous game, takes Kasumis place in the Women Fighters Team, while Geese Howard's underling Billy Kane, who previously participated in \"The King of Fighters '95\" tournament, returns to join forces with female agent Blue Mary and wanted felon Ryuji Yamazaki (both from \"Fatal Fury 3\") to form the unlikely \"'97 Special Team\". Iori returns as a Team Edit character along with Shingo Yabuki, a high school student who patterns his fighting style after his idol and reluctant mentor Kyo Kusanagi. An alternative version of Kyo with his pre-\"KOF '96\" moveset also appears as a hidden character.\n\nIori and Leona will fight as mid-boss characters in the Riot of the Blood curse depending of which characters the player is using. A team of all new characters also appears in the form of the \"New Faces Team\", consisting of bandmates Yashiro Nanakase, Shermie, and Chris. The New Face Team will be revealed to be the last three servants from Orochi during the Arcade Mode. Additionally, they fight as sub-boss characters having enhanced abilities than their common forms. Once they are beaten, Orochi will possess Chris' body to fight as the final boss character.\n\nIn order to decide who would become the members of the '97 Special Team, three polls were conducted by the video game journals \"Weekly Famitsu\", \"Gamest\" and \"Neo Geo Freak\", in which readers voted who was the character they wanted to see in the team. The Neo Geo Freak's winner was Billy Kane and Famitsu's winner was Ryuji Yamazaki. Blue Mary was first in the Gamest poll, barely beating Duck King from the \"Fatal Fury\" series who was second in the poll via a few mere votes. Additionally, the three journals created a team, which players can view an image of them after beating the game in the Japanese version. The special team created by the Neo Geo Freak's staff was a team of fire wielders: Billy, Kyo Kusanagi, and Mai Shiranui. The Gamest's team created was composed of Terry Bogard, Blue Mary and Joe Higashi, while Famitsu created a team composed of Chang Koehan, Choi Bounge and Ryuji Yamazaki. Although Blue Mary already had two designs in the \"Fatal Fury\" series at this point (her original \"Fatal Fury 3\" design and her \"Real Bout Special\" design), her designer wanted to use her \"Fatal Fury 3\" design as he liked it more. In order to have all of the eight servants from Orochi confirmed by this game, Yamazaki was chosen to be the new member as the staff noted him to be a good villain and liked that he was similar to a snake (as the ancient Orochi was a giant snake). In order to adapt him to \"KOF\", the game planner had to provide new moves to Yamazaki. The new moves were initially noted to be failures, but designers later thought of them as successful.\n\nThe New Faces Team was created to offset the remaining top three characters. Their members were developed to be the Hero Team's counterparts; Chris manipulates fire like Kyo, Shermie uses lightning like Benimaru Nikaido and Yashiro Nanakase is a giant man like Goro Daimon. The plot element of Chris acting as Orochi's new body was developed since initial stages of production, but the staff had already thought of using other ideas. At the inception of production, the plan was for Chris to use the \"Flame of Darkness (Black Flame),\" but due to difficulties of seeing the black flame in the screen it was changed to the purple ones. The final boss character, Orochi, was first meant to be \"a buck-naked Chris\" fighting with a shining energy ball. However, it was opted to his current design after developers made a survey in which there were only two votes in favor of the first design. His design codename was \"Chief\", but several people were against of giving him the name of \"Orochi\".\n\nIori Yagami in his Orochi form was originally meant to be the final boss of the game after the player beats the New Faces Team in their Orochi forms. However, it was later decided to make Orochi Iori the mid-boss with Orochi becoming the final boss and the New Faces Team as the sub-bosses. Series flagship director, Toyohisa Tanabe, states that the staff was initially reluctant to add this version of Iori to the series' roster — worried about fans' reactions — but did so to add more impact to the Orochi Saga's climax. He was particularly pleased to see surprised reactions from female fans to this form during KOF '97's location testing. After deciding Iori as the mid-boss character, developers also were focused in adding Leona as an alternative mid-boss character if players were already using Iori in the game. As such, several advertisements were added such as televisions broadcasts, sent to be given as a message to the player about a \"fork in the game\" to give hints about Orochi Leona.\n\nIn \"The King of Fighters '96\", several moves from Kyo were changed in order to adapt him to the new game system. However, the original moveset was still popular between gamers and as such, an alternative version from Kyo was added to \"KOF '97\". The introduction of this version was noted to be \"a hit\" with gamers. The staff kept adding new alternative versions of other characters to the sequels. This later led to the creation of the Kyo clones (Kyo-1 and Kyo-2) from \"The King of Fighters '99\".\n\n\"The King of Fighters '97\" was first released in Japanese arcades on July 28, 1997. It was ported to the Neo Geo and Neo-Geo CD on September 25, 1997 and October 30, 1997, respectively. A PlayStation version was also released on May 28, 1998. The Sega Saturn version was published on March 26, 1998 and it requires the same 1MB RAM cartridge utilized by the previous game. A \"Saturn Best Collection\" was released on October 1, 1998, adding a new cover and a lower price. It was also compiled in \"The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga\" in 2008 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii. During its release week, the Sega Saturn port of the game sold 94,327 copies in Japan. As of 2004, the sales went to 156,717. The PlayStation port sold 160,124 units.\n\n"}

It is the fifth game in \"The King of Fighters\" series. It was advertised by SNK as a \"special edition\" of the series, as it featured most of the characters who appeared in the previous games (from \"KOF '94\" to \"'97\").\n\n\"KOF '98\" was ported to the Neo-Geo CD in 1998 and for the PlayStation in Japan in 1999. A Dreamcast version titled The King of Fighters: Dream Match 1999 was released in 1999, which featured much of the background remade in 3D. The game was also remade for the PlayStation 2 as The King of Fighters '98: Ultimate Match, which expanded the number of playable characters.\n\n\"KOF '98\" has been commonly praised by several video game publications as the best \"KOF\" from the series due to its graphics and gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay does not differ much from the previous game, \"KOF '97\". Like in \"KOF '97\", the player has a choice between two playing styles: Advance and Extra, with a few slight modifications to Advanced mode (unlike in \"KOF '97\", the character will resume to normal if the player performs a Super Special Move in MAX state). This time when one character loses a round, the losing team is given a handicap in its favor. In Advanced mode, this means that the players stock capacity for Power Gauges is increased by one. In Extra mode, the time it takes to charge ones power gauge to maximum level is shortened, and the maximum remaining health requirement for a MAX Super Special Move is increased.\n\nAll the regular characters from the previous game return, along with several characters from preceding installments such as Vice and Mature (Iori's teammates from \"KOF '96\"), the American Sports Team (Heavy D!, Lucky Glauber, and Brian Battler) from \"KOF '94\", and the Old Men Team (or Veteran Fighters Team) composed of Heidern, Takuma Sakazaki, and Saisyu Kusanagi, all characters whose last appearances were in \"KOF '95\". Rugal Bernstein from \"KOF '94\" also returns as a Team Edit character, with his alter-ego Omega Rugal (the cyborg version of Rugal from \"KOF '95\") serving as the game's final boss in the Single Player Mode. Shingo Yabuki (who originally appeared in \"KOF '97\") continues as a Team Edit character, but also appears as a mid-boss character during the Arcade Mode. Additionally, the characters of Kyo Kusanagi, Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi, Ryo Sakazaki, Yuri Sakazaki and Robert Garcia are playable with movesets from previous titles of \"KOF\", while the alternate ones of Mai Shiranui and Billy Kane are based on their moveset from \"\".\n\nIn \"The King of Fighters '96\", several moves from Kyo Kusanagi were changed in order to adapt him to the new game system. However, the original moveset was still popular between gamers and as such, an alternative version of Kyo was added to \"The King of Fighters '97\". The introduction of this version was noted to be \"a hit\" within gamers, the staff kept adding new alternative versions of other characters in \"KOF '98\". Since this game did not have a storyline, the SNK staff decided to return Rugal Bernstein as the boss character noting that \"he's the only character who truly represents the ultimate \"KOF\" boss.\" Additionally, some of his special moves were redesigned, which the staff found to have made him the strongest version of Rugal as well as one of their favorites.\n\n\"KOF '98\" was originally released for arcades on July 23, 1998. It was ported to the Neo Geo AES on September 23, 1998, the Neo-Geo CD on December 23, 1998 and the PlayStation on March 25, 1999. The PlayStation version was published in North America and the PAL region by Agetec, becoming the first PlayStation installment in the series to be released outside Japan since \"The King of Fighters '95\". The original game is also included in \"The King of Fighters Collection: Orochi Saga\" compilation released in North America and the PAL region for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii (the game was not included in the Japanese \"Orochi Hen\" compilation). The game was later re-released for iOS and Android.\n\nA Dreamcast version was also released on June 24, 1999 under the title \"The King of Fighters: Dream Match 1999\", reflecting the year the version was released. This game was released in North America on September 30, 1999. It featured remade 3D backdrops and ran at 60 frames per second.\n\n\"KOF '98\" was remade under the title of \"The King of Fighters '98: Ultimate Match\" released in 2008, ten years after the original games release. It was released in Japan as an arcade game for the Taito Type X hardware on March 2008. The PlayStation 2 port released on June 26, and was also published on the \"NeoGeo Online Collection The Best\" on June 18, 2008. The game was released in North America by Ignition Entertainment on March 3, 2009. In the European Union it was released on June 10, 2009. A version for the IGS PolyGame Master 2 arcade hardware was also released in 2009, which was called The King of Fighters '98: Ultimate Match Hero.\n\n\"Ultimate Match\" includes additional characters not featured in the original version of the game, such as Eiji Kisaragi from \"KOF '95\", along with Kasumi Todoh and the Boss Team (composed of Geese Howard, Wolfgang Krauser, and Mr. Big) from \"KOF '96\", as well as the boss characters Goenitz and Orochi, essentially including all the characters featured in the \"KOF\" series prior to \"KOF '98\". New moves were added to the USA Sports Team to improve their playability, and EX versions of certain characters not featured in the original version were added, including King with her \"Art of Fighting 2\" moveset, and Ryuji Yamazaki, Blue Mary and Geese Howard with their \"Real Bout Fatal Fury 2\" moveset. The Orochi versions of Leona and Iori Yagami are also playable, and both also appear as mid-bosses in the Arcade Mode. New stages were added to the game such as China and Hong Kong to show appreciation for \"KOF\"'s high popularity in such regions; it is also the only fighting game to feature an accurate representation of Saudi Arabia in one stage, as the country was a major market for the NEO GEO line in the early 1990s. A third fighting style is also introduced in addition to Advance and Extra, dubbed \"Ultimate\" mode. Ultimate mode is a customizable style that allows the player to choose between features from Advance or Extra mode, such as which kind of Power Gauge to use. It also includes a 'Neo Geo' mode, which is a direct port of the original Neo Geo console version.\n\nA mobile game based on \"Ultimate Match\", called \"The King of Fighters '98UM OL\", was released by Chinese company Ourpalm for the iOS and Android platforms on July 9, 2016.\n\nA Microsoft Windows port was released on Steam on December 16, 2014, and on GOG.com on June 1, 2018.\n\nDuring its release week, the Dreamcast port of the game sold 58,354 copies in Japan. As of 2004, the sales increased to 104,049. \"Famitsu\" magazine scored the Dreamcast port of \"KOF '98\" a 30 out of 40, and GameRankings gave it a 71% based on a total of 18 reviews.\n\nVarious reviewers from video game publications have commented on \"KOF '98\". While reviewing the compilation \"The King of Fighters: The Orochi Saga\", Matt Edwards from Eurogamer noted \"KOF '98\" to be the most enjoyable game from the collection as well as the most famous game from the series \"that really made people stand up and take an interest in the series. We'd disagree in favor of some of the later games, but for its time \"KOF '98\" was reasonably well balanced for a 2D fighter. And there's no denying it was a blast.\" The game also received praise by 1UP.com writer Richard Li who found it to be the most balanced game from the \"KOF\" series due to the fact it improved the game mechanics from the previous titles. Jeremy Dunham from IGN gave the game an 8.4, praising, apart from the gameplay and characters, the graphics, the music as well as the backgrounds design added for the Dreamcast version. However, he was disappointed with the lack of story in the game, noting the ones from previous games to be very entertaining. GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann found it to be one of the best 2D fighting games, noting that although new players may find it hard to play due to the difficulty in executing various special moves and how difficult the opponent AI is. Although Andy Chien from Gaming Age found that the Dreamcast port of the game was well done since it does not have the disadvantages that it had in other consoles, he noted it \"could have been a lot better.\" He also found that the game had a bug when he tried to perform a special move from Mai Shiranui, which unlike the other ports, is very inconsistent.\n\nTom Russo reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"Not bad, but with so many other high-quality fighters available, this one only makes sense for players nostalgic for old NeoGeo fighting games.\"\n\nGameRankings gave \"Ultimate Match\" a 77% based on 14 reviews for the PlayStation 2 version and 74% based on 5 reviews for the Xbox 360 version. Metacritic gave it a 73 out of 100 for both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 versions based on 11 reviews and 4 reviews respectively. Various publications for video games and other media have commented on \"Ultimate Match\" with IGN writer Ryan Clements giving it a 7.8, saying that probably this game should only be recommended to fans of \"The King of Fighters\" due to how old its graphics are as well as the little balance it has with 60 characters being playable. James Mielke from 1UP.com complained on how the game is very similar to \"KOF '98\", but found the controls to be comfortable and intuitive for any fans of 2D fighting games. However, Heath Hooker from GameZone found that the gameplay and sound from the game make up for the graphics even though there is not much difference between \"KOF '98\" and \"KOF '98: Ultimate Match\". In 2013, \"KOF '98 Ultimate Match\" was ranked as the 15th best arcade game of the 1990s by \"Complex\", who also called it \"possibly the greatest SNK fighting game of them all,\" and included it on their list of 25 best 2D fighting games of all time in 2013.\n\nIn 2017, the Chinese mobile game \"King of Fighters '98UM OL\" grossed () in Japan.\n\n"}

Construction difficulties delayed westward progress, until American financier Jay Gould acquired an interest in the railroad in 1879. The T&P never reached San Diego; instead it met the Southern Pacific at Sierra Blanca, Texas, in 1881.\n\nThe Missouri Pacific Railroad, also controlled by Gould, leased the T&P from 1881 to 1885 and continued a cooperative relationship with the T&P after the lease ended. Missouri Pacific gained majority ownership of the Texas and Pacific Railway's stock in 1928 but allowed it to continue operation as a separate entity until they were eventually merged on October 15, 1976. On January 8, 1980, the Missouri Pacific Railroad was purchased by the Union Pacific Railroad. Because of lawsuits filed by competing railroads, the merger was not approved until September 13, 1982. However, due to outstanding bonds of the Missouri Pacific, the actual merger with the Union Pacific Railroad took place on January 1, 1997.\n\nSeveral reminders of the Texas and Pacific remain to this day, mainly two towering buildings which help define the southern side of Fort Worth's skyline—the original station and office tower (pictured below) and a warehouse located immediately to the west. In 2001, the passenger platforms at the T&P station were put into use for the first time in decades as the westernmost terminus for the Trinity Railway Express, a commuter rail line connecting Fort Worth and Dallas. The warehouse still exists but there are plans to renovate it. The passenger terminal and corporate offices have been converted into luxury condominiums.\nMajor named passenger trains of the Texas and Pacific (route sections between St. Louis and Texarkana were operated by Missouri Pacific):\n\n\n\"T&P\" includes its subsidiary roads (A&S, D&PS, T-NM etc.); operated route-miles totalled 2259 at the end of 1929 (after C&NE, PVS and TSL had become subsidiaries) and 2033 at the end of 1960.\n\nThe Texas and Pacific was unable to finance construction to San Diego, and as a result the Southern Pacific was able to build from California to Sierra Blanca, Texas. In doing so, Southern Pacific used land designated for, and surveyed by Texas and Pacific, in its rail line from Yuma, Arizona, to El Paso, Texas. This resulted in lawsuits, which were settled with agreements to share tracks, and to cooperate in the building of new tracks. Most of the features advantageous to Texas and Pacific were later disallowed by legislation.\n\nUnder the influence of General Buell the TPRR was originally to be gauge, but this was overturned when the state legislature passed a law requiring gauge.\n\nFrom 1873 to 1881 the Texas and Pacific built a total of 972 miles (1,560 km) of track; as a result it was entitled to land grants totalling 12,441,600 acres (50,349 km²). T&P, however, received land only for the construction of track east of Fort Worth. This meant the firm received only 5,173,120 acres (20,935 km²). The State of Texas did not award the additional area because, it said, the construction had not been completed within the time required by the firm's charter. The then state Attorney General Charles A. Culberson filed suit to recover 301,893 acres (1,222 km²) on the grounds that \"the road had been granted land partly on sidetracks and partly on land not subject to location.\" The state ultimately recovered 256,046 acres (1,036 km²) giving a net grant to the T&P of 4,917,074 acres (19,899 km²), or 7,683 square miles. By comparison, the state of Connecticut is 5,543 square miles (14,356 km²).\n\nThe Texas Pacific Land Trust (NYSE: TPL) was created in 1888 in the wake of the bankruptcy of the T&P in order to provide an efficient and orderly way to sell the railway's land, receiving at the time in excess of 3.5 million acres (14,000 km²). As of 31 December 2006 the Trust was still the largest private land owner in the state of Texas, owning the surface estate of 966,392 acres (3,911 km²) spread across 20 counties in the western part of the state. The Trust also generates income from oil & gas royalties through its 1/128 non-participating royalty interest under 85,414 acres (346 km²) and 1/16 non-participating royalty interest under 386,988 acres (1,566 km²).\n\n\n"}

It is the sixth installment in \"The King of Fighters\" series, introducing a new story arc known as the \"NESTS Chronicles\" which is centered around a young man named K', who is formerly associated with a mysterious yet threatening organization known only as NESTS. The game introduces several changes to the established \"KOF\" format, most notably an assisting character labeled \"Striker\". The game was ported to the Neo-Geo CD and the PlayStation. Dreamcast and Microsoft Windows versions were also released under the title whose stages were remodeled into 3D.\n\nSNK had originally planned to remove main characters Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, who had previously appeared in earlier installments of the series, from \"The King of Fighters '99\", but they ended up as hidden characters instead. The popularity of Kyo's previous incarnations resulted in him being given \"clones\" that wear his original clothes and perform his moves. SNK had difficulty balancing the age of the characters and teams. The Neo Geo and Dreamcast versions are both included in \"The Kings of Fighters NESTS Hen\" compilation released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan as well as other ports.\n\nCritical response to \"The King of Fighters '99\" has generally been positive because of its fighting system and its use of Strikers. The Dreamcast porting of the game has had a more favorable reception than the PlayStation version thanks to its loading times and graphics. The Nintendo Switch porting has garnered a similar response, with reviewers finding it modern and praising its gameplay. While the game has sold well, overall sales have been less than those of the series' previous game because of poor sales of the console versions.\n\nInstead of the three-character teams from earlier \"The King of Fighters\" (\"KOF\") games, each team now has four members. Before a match, the player chooses three of the characters to use in the fights. The fourth member becomes the Striker the player summons during battle to help their character by performing one of their Special Moves against the opponent. A Striker can be summoned only a limited number of times during a single match. This is determined by the number of \"Strike Bombs\" at the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe selectable fighting styles, Advanced and Extra, from \"The King of Fighters '98\" have been removed. Instead, the game has a single playing style modeled after the Advanced mode from the previous game, where the player fills their power gauge by attacking the opponent or performing special moves. This time, there are two powered-up states the player can choose during battle depending on the button combination used. Counter Mode increases the player's offensive strength and allows them unlimited use of their character's Super Special Move. There is also a combo that transitions from a Special Move into a Super Special Move by using a \"Super Cancellation Attack\" or a \"Moving Attack\". The other powered-up mode is Armor Mode, which increases the character's defensive strength, allowing them to take more damage from the opponent; however, the player cannot use Super Special Moves in Armor Mode.\n\nDepending on the player's performance, a score is given when the fight is finished. Should a high score be reached, the arcade mode will offer the player an extra fight following the final boss.\n\nThe Dreamcast version had different stages and a few new selectable Striker characters. The new Strikers had consisted of Kyo Kusanagi (in a different outfit), Athena Asamiya (in her school outfit), Goro Daimon, Billy Kane, Ryuji Yamazaki, Chizuru Kagura, Syo Kirishima, Alfred Airhawk, Vanessa, Seth, Fiolina Germi, and Gai Tendo. As well, the game can be connected to the Neo Geo Pocket Color game \"\". Points won in \"Battle de Paradise\" can be transferred to \"The King of Fighters '99: Evolution\" to speed up the leveling process for the Extra Strikers.\n\nTwo years have passed since the last King of Fighters tournament. Nobody has seen Kyo Kusanagi or Iori Yagami since they defeated the evil being Orochi at the climax of the 1997 tournament. Invitations are sent to many characters inviting them to a new tournament, which this time around is more of a secretive affair and away from the public eye than the ones in both '96 and '97, with each team now having an additional member. However, the tournament's host remains unknown.\n\nThe increased number of characters per team, and the story element of the missing Kyo and Iori, lead to a reshuffling of the character roster. K' is introduced as the game's new protagonist with his partner, Maxima, who joins forces with Kyo's former teammates Benimaru Nikaido and Shingo Yabuki to form the new Hero Team. Takuma Sakazaki rejoins the Art of Fighting Team as its fourth member. Mai Shiranui finally becomes an official member of the Fatal Fury Team for the first time in the series. King joins forces with Blue Mary (formerly a member of the \"'97 Special Team\") to form the new Women Fighters Team with Kasumi Todoh (last seen in \"KOF '96\") and Li Xiangfei (from \"\"). The three returning teams also gain a new member: Whip for the Ikari Warriors Team, Bao for the Psycho Soldier Team, and Jhun Hoon for the Korea Justice Team. The game also introduces two clones of Kyo Kusanagi, Kyo-1 and Kyo-2, as Team Edit characters based on previous playable incarnations of the character. The real Kyo also returns with his rival, Iori, but they are only secret playable characters.\n\nThe game's antagonist is Krizalid, an agent from the mysterious organization NESTS who uses the data he obtained from his enemies to activate an army of Kyo clones that NESTS themselves had created after the fight against Orochi. He is faced in two states: first he appears with a special coat that analyzes an opponent's data. Once he's defeated, he burns away his coat and increases his strength while having stronger moves. After Krizalid's defeat, his superior kills him via falling debris while other members of NESTS attack K' and Maxima, who are revealed to be former NESTS agents and that the duo succeed in defeating their enemies before making their escape from the collapsing location of their battle against Krizalid. It's also revealed that K' is a test subject designed to replicate Kyo's techniques.\n\nWith the introduction of a new lead character, K', SNK had originally planned to remove main characters Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, who had previously appeared in earlier installments of the series, from \"The King of Fighters '99\". Instead, they ended up as unlockable hidden characters after fans responded negatively to their removal at location tests. Kyo was redesigned for this game, but the developers still liked his school uniform. As a result, based on the practice of adding earlier versions of various characters to games, the staff created the Kyo clones that featured him with classic movesets: Kyo-1 uses Kyo's movesets from the first two games, while Kyo-2 uses his movesets from \"KOF '96\" and \"KOF '97\". To contrast with the previous series' protagonist, Kyo, K' was designed to be the \"dark hero\". The staff wanted to create a Robo Army Team. This idea was abandoned, but they later created a tribute to it in \"The King of Fighters 2000\" by introducing Rocky, a character from \"Robo Army\", as a Striker for Maxima. The character Whip was originally meant to appear in \"KOF '96\", but due to Leona Heidern's introduction in that game, the staff decided to wait until \"KOF '99\".\n\nLike the earlier games the artwork was done by Shinkiro. The large number of young characters appearing in the game represented a problem for the developers; as a result, the staff introduced older characters such as Seth and Vanessa (who appeared only in the Dreamcast version as Strikers and would not officially debut until the following game) to balance the game. Bao was added to reduce the average age of the Psycho Soldiers Team from 42 to 34. The boss character, Krizalid, was designed \"with a straight, stylish appearance and earnest strength\"; however, the designer in charge mentioned he \"overdid it\". Due to the large number of unused graphics accumulated on the Neo Geo version, some of Krizalid's graphics were removed. With the release of the Dreamcast porting, the staff could add Krizalid's graphics because of the console's capacity. Vanessa was meant to be a playable character, but due to time constraints, she was only a Striker in the Dreamcast porting.\n\n\"KOF '99\" was originally released for the Neo Geo arcade on July 22, 1999. A porting to the Neo Geo and Neo-Geo CD consoles was released on September 23, 1999, and December 2, 1999, respectively. The PlayStation porting was published on March 23, 2000, in Japan, and on April 22, 2001, in North America. In Japan, it was later republished for the \"PlayStation SNK Best Collection\" on March 29, 2001, and once again on July 25, 2002. The North American port was the subject of censorship and blood was omitted. Whip's firearm is edited out of the game's American arcade release, but is uncensored in home release versions. After being released on Wii Virtual Console between 2012 and 2013, the game was released as a part of the ACA Neo Geo range on the Nintendo Switch eShop on May 25, 2017, adding an online mode.\n\nThe game was remade for the Dreamcast as \"The King of Fighters '99: Evolution\". It was published in Japan on March 30, 2000, and reprinted on October 25, 2001, with the \"SNK Best\" logo. In North America, Agetec published it on May 10, 2001. In this port, players can change the audio to listen to arranged tracks of the soundtrack. The game was released during the PlayStation 2's launch and the Dreamcast's ending, and it did not achieve very good sales. On its release week, the Dreamcast porting sold 41,387 units, later reaching 67,833 in Japan in 2000. The PlayStation port sold 96,484. Two CD soundtracks and a drama CD were also released.\n\nThe Neo Geo and Dreamcast versions are included in the compilation \"The Kings of Fighters NESTS Hen\" released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan. The game was also made available for the PlayStation 4 but only in Japan by Hamster Corporation.\n\n\"The King of Fighters '99\" was very popular after its release. In \"GameSpot\"s article \"The History of SNK\", \"KOF '99: Evolution\" was described as one of the best fighting games on the Dreamcast with \"\". Various video game publications have commented on the game. While the fighting system has been well-received, critics have expressed mixed feelings about the Striker system.\n\nA \"Gaming Age\" writer viewed the sequel's changes as a step in the right direction despite finding assisting characters useless. He said that SNK had created proper balances such as making Kyo Kusanagi less overpowered than in previous games. The inclusion of K', the new lead, has been well-received because of his distinct fighting style. \"IGN\"s Anthony Chau commented that although \"people are probably tired of 2D fighting games, saying that they all play the same\", he found \"KOF '99: Evolution\" to be very distinct. He found the new gameplay very entertaining despite knowing that some \"\"KOF\" purists hate the Striker system\". A \"GameSpot\" reviewer described the Striker system as \"clearly derived from the tag system from Capcom's Marvel fighting games\". They complained there were popular characters who only appeared as Strikers, and wished they were fully playable. \"GamePro\" criticized the game because the Strikers' new gameplay \"simply [does not] fit in the King of Fighters series\" and \"is more of a novelty than a game mode\".\n\nThere were mixed responses to the ported versions. German magazine \"Video Games\" praised the Neo Geo porting, giving it a score of 80%. There have also been multiple comparisons between the Dreamcast porting and the PlayStation porting, with the Dreamcast version being regarded as better. The use of 3D backgrounds in all versions has been praised. A \"GamePro\" writer felt that the Neo Geo's quality was not handled well by the PlayStation, resulting in issues with the graphics and long loading times. Nevertheless, he found the additional material to be pleasing for series' fans. Andrew Seyoon Park of \"GameSpot\" found the PlayStation porting very good considering the console's limitations. Despite this, he complained about the animation and the voices, and found the reduced number of characters from \"KOF '98\" disappointing. He felt that the boss Krizalid is very hard to beat. \"HardcoreGaming\" noted that while the Dreamcast port of the game was superior based on its graphics and loading times, the PlayStation version was still worth playing. Both \"Uvejuegos\" stated that while the game did not have a major update of its characters, except Kyo Kusanagi's redesign, it still managed to maintain its quality due to its fighting system. The new lead, K', and the final boss, Krizalid, were described as entertaining. \"Gaming Age\" felt the graphic update was more noticeable than the \"Uvejuegos\" did but was critical of Krizalid. \"Gaming Age\" found him so difficult to defeat they characterized the previous bosses— Rugal Bernstein and Orochi—as easy by comparison. \"GameSpot\" agreed, feeling that the boss fight removed the entertainment value from the game due to its difficult challenge.\n\nGreg Orlando reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"This \"King of Fighters\" should consider abdicating the throne.\"\n\nThe game's Nintendo Switch porting received positive responses with critics saying its gameplay and graphics were ahead of their time. \"Nintendo Life\" praised the varied cast and the new gameplay mechanics but did not find it as appealing as its predecessor. \"GameSpew\" felt the porting's mechanics, and multiple options prevented the game from being dated. The combat was described as fast enough to appeal to gamers. \"Bonus Stage\" found the graphics appealing and praised SNK's focus on giving the game a storyline, despite it being an arcade fighting game. In retrospect, \"1UP.com\" said that while players were bothered by Kyo and Iori's exclusion from teams, and by the Striker system, K's inclusion was one of SNK's best decisions due to his fighting style.\n\nThe series' writer, Akihiko Ureshino, wrote a novelization of the game titled \"Beyond the \"K\"\". It was released in November 1999 by ASCII. SNK also released a sequel titled \"The King of Fighters 2000\" a year after \"KOF '99\"s release for multiple consoles. In the spin-off game \"The Rhythm of Fighters\", Kyo's character theme, \"Tears\", was used for the game to work as a rhythm game.\n\n"}

Cape Matapan is the southernmost point of mainland Greece, and the second southernmost point in mainland Europe. It separates the Messenian Gulf in the west from the Laconian Gulf in the east.\n\nCape Taenarum in classical antiquity was the site of the city of Taenarum, (Ancient Greek: Ταίναρον) now in ruins. In ancient Greek mythology the eponymous c\"tistes -\" the founder-hero of the city - was Taenarus, (Ταίναρος) who was credited with establishing the city's important temple of Poseidon.\n\nGreeks used the proverb Tainarian evil (), meaning a great and unlawful evil affecting suppliants, for the Spartans killed the Helots who had fled into Tainaron.\n\nCape Matapan has been an important place for thousands of years. Near Taenarum, there is a cave that Greek legends claimed was the home of Hades, the god of the dead. The ancient Spartans built several temples there, dedicated to various gods. On the hill situated above the cave, lie the remnants of an ancient temple dedicated to the sea god Poseidon (Νεκρομαντεῖον Ποσειδῶνος). Under the Byzantine Empire, the temple was converted into a Christian church, and Christian rites are conducted there to this day. Cape Matapan was once the place where mercenaries waited to be employed.\n\nAt Cape Matapan, the \"Titanic\"'s would-be rescue ship, the SS \"Californian\", was torpedoed and sunk by German forces on 9 November 1915. In March 1941, a major naval battle, the Battle of Cape Matapan, occurred off the coast of Cape Matapan, between the Royal Navy and the Italian Regia Marina, in which the British emerged victorious in a one-sided encounter. The encounter's main result was to drastically reduce future Italian naval activity in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nMore recently a lighthouse was constructed, but it is now in disuse.\nAs the southernmost point of mainland Greece, the cape is on the migration route of birds headed to Africa.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2146476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146476", "title": "ManKind Project", "text": "ManKind Project\n\nManKind Project (MKP) is a global network of nonprofit organizations focused on modern male initiation, self-awareness, and personal growth.\n\nThe ManKind Project has 12 regions: Australia, Belgium, Canada, French Speaking Europe, New Zealand, Nordic (Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland), South Africa, Switzerland, Germany, The United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States. There are also 7 developing regions: Costa Rica, Mexico, The Netherlands, China, Singapore, India, Central Africa (Cameroon, DRC) and Israel.\n\nMKP has its origins in the mythopoetic men's movement of the early 1980s, drawing heavily on the works of Robert Bly, Robert L. Moore, and Douglas Gillette. In 1984, Rich Tosi, a former Marine Corps officer; Bill Kauth, a social worker, therapist, and author; and university professor Ron Hering, Ph.D. (Curriculum Studies); created an experiential weekend for men called the \"Wildman Weekend\" (later renamed \"The New Warrior Training\"). As the popularity of the training grew, they formed a New Warrior Network organization, which would later become The Mankind Project.\n\nMKP states:\n\nMKP states that those who undertake this journey pass through three phases characteristic to virtually all historic forms of male initiation: descent, ordeal and return. Participants surrender all electronic devices (cell phones, watches, laptops, etc.), weapons (guns, knives, etc.) and jewelry for the weekend. This was explained as way of removing the \"noise of a man's life\", separating the man \"from what he is comfortable with,\" and ensuring the safety of all participants.\n\nParticipants agree to confidentiality of the NWTA processes, to create an experience \"uncluttered by expectation\" for the next man and to protect the privacy of all participants. MKP encourages participants to freely discuss what they learned about themselves with anyone.\n\nTraining courses usually involve 20 to 32 participants, and some 30 to 45 staff. The course usually takes place at a retreat center, over a 48-hour period, with a one-to-one ratio of staff to participants.\n\nResearchers reported on data from 100 men, whom they interviewed and administered a battery of questionnaires, before the men participated in a New Warrior Training Adventure during 1997-1999. The same men completed a set of follow-up questionnaires 18 months after they had completed the NWTA. The men endorsed changes such as \"... [becoming more] assertive and clear with others about what I want or need\" and \"... accept[ing] total responsibility for all aspects of my life\". The study findings also indicated that the men had more social support and experienced more life satisfaction 18 months after the NWTA.\n\nThe authors acknowledge limitations to their research, since they did not have a comparison or control group, which results in various \"threats to internal validity\" mentioned by the researchers, primarily \"history\", \"maturation\", and \"selection bias\".\n\nA second study accumulated data from 45 trainings held between 2006-2009, indicated that the psychological well-being of participants, as well as other indicators, improved after the initial weekend of participation in an NWTA. Many of the initial changes endured across a 2-year follow-up period.\n\nMKP co-founder Bill Kauth's 1992 book \"A Circle of Men: The Original Manual for Men's Support Groups\" details how groups of men can assemble to help one another emotionally and psychologically. Men who have completed the NWTA are encouraged to consider joining such a group. An optional \"Integration Group\" training is offered shortly after each NWTA; a fee is charged for this training (fees vary by community and format). Some training courses are part of a small integration group on their own with qualified leaders, other training courses take place over an entire weekend and can cost between $100 and $250 depending on lodging, location, and number of men attending.\n\nThe \"I-Group\" is for participants to engage in ongoing personal work and to apply the principles learned on the NWTA to their lives. I-Groups are available to all men who complete the NWTA, and sometimes to men who want to explore the Mankind Project. Many I-Groups meet one evening per week. A typical I-Group meeting includes conversation and sharing in a series of \"rounds\" that allow each man to be heard.\n\nIn both the New Warrior weekend and the follow-up groups, Mankind Project \"... focuses on men's emotional well-being, drawing on elements like Carl Jung's theories of the psyche, nonviolent communication, breath work, Native American customs, and good old-fashioned male bonding\".\n\nA study conducted in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area collected retrospective survey data from members of 45 I-groups that met between 1990 and 1998. At the end of the study period (1998), 23 groups were active and 22 had disbanded. Groups were active for 4.5 years (median), and the median length of individual participation was 26.2 months (2.2 years). Each group consisted of about six men. Survey participants rated their groups as moderately effective.\n\nMKP is affiliated with several similar training programs:\n\n\nMy Morning Jacket frontman (vocals, guitar) Jim James, told Pitchfork magazine:\n\nThere's this group called ManKind Project, they lead retreats to try and help men feel more OK with all the different sides of being a man. I went on one of those retreats because I was so intrigued. It was fucking amazing. The experience was about taking accountability for yourself and your actions ...\n\nActor Wentworth Miller, in an address to the Human Rights Campaign during an event in 2013, describes his involvement with MKP as vital to his coming out process, and his introduction to being part of an accepting community. In his letter rejecting an invitation to the Festival of Festivals, Saint Petersburg on grounds that he as a gay man could not support the event while Russian law prohibits homosexuality, Miller signed as a member of the ManKind Project as well as member of the HRC and GLAAD.\n\nActor Eka Darville told the New York Times that MKP helped him become a better father, commenting, \"There is no way I could have done that without a brotherhood telling me all the bull I was projecting onto my wife . ... \"\n\nFrederick Marx, a film director, writer, and producer (Hoop Dreams, Journey from Zanskar) talks openly about his involvement with MKP, and has made documentary films involving the organization, e.g., \"The Tatanka Alliance\" about a \"Hunka\" ceremony to consecrate an alliance between the ManKind Project USA and the Pine Ridge Oglala Lakota elders community.\n\nA 2007 \"Houston Press\" article detailed criticisms of the ManKind Project. Anthropology associate professor Norris G. Lang said that some of the groups' exercises that he attended were \"fairly traumatic\" and were \"dangerous territory for an unprofessional\"; and Anti-cult advocate Rick Alan Ross said that The ManKind Project appears to use coercive mind-control tactics, such as limiting participants' sleep and diet, cutting them off from the outside world, forcing members to keep secrets, and using intimidation. The ManKind Project responded stating that their organization does not exhibit characteristics of a cult as commonly defined, such as having \"a single charismatic leader\" and \"separation from the outside world.\"\n\nA 2007 wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of Texan Michael Scinto charged that MKP was responsible for his suicide. The parents said that he had struggled with alcohol and cocaine addiction in the past. Scinto was a 29-year-old adult who had been sober for a year and a half prior to his attending MKP's \"New Warrior Training Adventure\" in July 2005. Two days after Scinto returned from the NWTA retreat, he sought psychiatric help at Ben Taub Hospital. He subsequently resumed drinking and taking drugs, and he then committed suicide. The parties settled in 2008. The terms of the settlement were not publicly disclosed, although a copy of the court documents were posted online by Warren Throckmorton, and aspects of the settlement were reported in the press.\n"}

{"id": "2146495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146495", "title": "Karnal bunt", "text": "Karnal bunt\n\nKarnal bunt (also known as partial bunt) is a fungal disease of wheat, durum wheat, and triticale. The smut fungus Tilletia indica, a basidiomycete, invades the kernels and obtains nutrients from the endosperm, leaving behind waste products with a disagreeable odor that makes bunted kernels too unpalatable for use in flour or pasta. While Karnal bunt generally does not lead to devastating crop losses, it has the potential to dramatically decrease yield and poses additional economic concerns through quarantines which limit the export of suspected infectious wheat products from certain areas, including the U.S. Several chemical control methods exist for Karnal bunt of wheat, but much work remains to be done in identifying resistant host varieties.\n\nKarnal bunt attacks durum wheat, rye, and triticale, a hybrid of wheat and rye. Despite its preference for a common crop, Karnal bunt can be extremely difficult to diagnose in the field for many reasons. First, not all kernels on a plant head will be infected, and thus infected plants are not as readily identifiable. This distribution is the reason for Karnal bunt's being referred to as partial bunt. Another factor which makes Karnal bunt difficult to readily diagnose in the field is the fact that most infected kernels do not show symptoms prior to maturity.\n\nThe disease produces dark color and a fishy smell on infected kernels. Usually only the germ end of the kernel will show symptoms, but occasionally the entire kernel may appear diseased. The darkening of the kernel is a result of the kernel tissue being converted in a teliospore mass by the fungus. Another symptom is referred to as the \"canoe symptom\" as in the process of replacing the healthy kernel with teliospores, the disease tends to hollow out host kernels, resulting in a canoe shape. While the dark teliospores of the fungus may be diagnostic, diagnosis of Karnal bunt poses the added difficulty of differentiating between Karnal bunt from other infections which also result in the aforementioned symptoms, such as black point, common bunt, and dwarf bunt.\n\nThe disease is primarily spread through contaminated seed or farm equipment, although it may also be carried short distances by the wind, especially following the burning of wheat fields. Evidence of the importance of airborne dispersal of \"Tilletia indica\" was demonstrated by Halasz et al. in 2014 when they discovered a strong correlation between teliospore concentration in the air above a wheat crop and the subsequent number of infected wheat kernels. The researchers concluded that this airborne spread of teliospores could also result in post-harvest disease development. The fungal spores can then remain viable for several years, germinating when weather conditions become favorable for development. Once the spores germinate, they infect the wheat flowers and develop large masses of spores on the embryo end of the kernels (the entire kernel is not usually affected).\n\nIn preferred weather conditions, a teliospore which has successfully attached to a susceptible host will germinate to produce what is known as a promycelium. At the apex of this structure, then, can be found 65–180 primary sporidia. Secondary sporidia can then either bud from the primary sporidia or from the fungal threads of the mycelium itself. These secondary sporidia are responsible for infecting young host plants through the ovary wall in the flowering stage. Secondary sporidia accomplish this by penetrating the epidermis of host glumes via germ tubes. Sporidia are then able to enter the maturing kernels and leave vast numbers of teliospores where healthy kernel tissue used to be. During harvest teliospores fall from the kernels to the soil from which point they may be carried elsewhere by wind or tools, thereby restarting the disease cycle.\n\nKarnal bunt is named after Karnal, India, where the disease was first discovered on a wheat crop in 1931. Since then, the disease has been reported in all major wheat-growing states of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mexico, and certain areas of the Southwestern United States such as New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Texas.\n\nKarnal bunt pathogenesis is heavily dependent on weather conditions. Relative humidity over 70% favors teliospore development. Furthermore, daytime temperatures in the range of 18–24 °C, and soil temperatures in the range of 17–21 °C also increase the severity of Karnal bunt.\n\nControl of \"Tilletia indica\" has proven challenging for many reasons. First, since teliospores do not infect kernels systematically, chemical control via seed treatments has not been a viable solution. Several other methods, such as delaying planting so as to avoid the weather conditions which favor teliospore germination, have been proven to be effective to some extent, but also pose the risk of reducing yield. Other cultural controls such as crop-rotation may be practical as the planting of non-host species for several years may reduce the number of teliospores in given field significantly.\n\nChemical control methods also hold promise for controlling Karnal bunt of wheat. In a 1986 study, Smilanick et al. were able to eradicate over 80% of \"Tilletia indica\" infection in wheat following two foliar applications of the fungicide propiconozole. The researchers had the same success using four foliar applications of the fungicides mancozeb or copper hydroxide. These chemical treatments were most effective when applied to host foliage 72 hours post-infection, but were not effective at all when applied to host seeds.\n\nIn 2009 researchers investigated the \"Muscodor albus\" fungus as a biocontrol agent for Karnal bunt of wheat. While biofumigation with this fungus was effective in reducing the capacity of other species of Tellitia to cause disease, this method was ineffective against the dormant teliospores of Tellitia indica. In a similar effort, researchers tested a variety of plant extracts in the hopes of finding a non-chemical control method of Karnal bunt of wheat. The researchers found extract of Acalypha indica and Lantana camara, when sprayed on wheat leaves, to reduce the number of infected plants by 65%.\n\nAs is likely the case for any plant disease, host resistance is the most practical and desired control method. Researchers analyzed the HD29 cultivar of \"Triticum aestivum\", or common wheat, in order to explore the possibility of control via host resistance. Researchers identified three genes coding for resistance to the Ni8 isolate of the disease, and two coding for resistance to the Ni7 isolate. The two genes coding for Ni7 resistance also code for Ni8 resistance, meaning that it may be possible to identify a common gene which may confer resistance to \"T. indica.\"\n\nKarnal bunt accounts for yield losses of approximately 0.5% annually, which is negligible. Some fields of particularly susceptible wheat cultivars in India, however, have suffered losses of up to 40% in the past, but such events are rare. Significant economic losses in wheat crops occur due to quarantine and other export restrictions placed on infected areas. Furthermore, Karnal bunt of wheat poses no threat to human life in the United States as regulations deem wheat containing more than 3% bunted kernels unfit for human consumption and these crops are instead used in animal feed.\n\nAppearance of the disease in the United States in early 1996 resulted in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) implementing an emergency quarantine, inspection, and certification program for wheat moving out of the infested areas, along with regulations on sanitizing machinery and storage facilities. Many foreign countries have a zero tolerance for karnal bunt in import shipments. As one of the world's top exporters of wheat, such restrictions negatively impact the U.S. economy.\n\n"}

A version for the Game.com was also planned, with Tiger Electronics as the developer, though Tiger producer Allen Richardson admitted that the game would be difficult to do on the Game.com due to the 16 megabit size of the cartridges.\n\n\"Madden NFL 98\" was positively received, with the overwhelming majority of critics agreeing that the new \"liquid AI\" had eliminated the longstanding \"Madden NFL\" series problem of \"money plays\" that could be used to successfully run the ball in any situation, making the game more challenging and the final scores more comparable to those of real football games. Kraig Kujawa of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" called it \"the smartest football game I've played\", and Gary Cutlack of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" said the new AI \"Makes the game a lot harder, but a well earned victory is much more satisfying, don't you think?\" \"Next Generation\" dissented with the majority, contending that while the AI was improved from the previous installment of the series, they had managed to find some \"money plays\". However, other aspects of the game were widely praised as well, particularly the lively audio commentary, realistic animations, and wide selection of options. Several reviewers made particular mention of the new \"fantasy draft\" option.\n\nBy far the largest source of criticism was the use of sprite-based rather than polygon-based players. While full polygonal football video games were unexplored territory (the first fully polygonal football game, \"NFL GameDay 98\", was released the same month as \"Madden NFL 98\", and \"GameSpot\" acknowledged that polygonal graphics are a much greater drain on processing power in football games than other genres, due to the large number of players), most critics felt that the \"Madden\" series, as the leader in the football genre, should have advanced into it by this time. \"Next Generation\" in particular felt that the \"Madden\" series had unequivocally been dethroned by its failure to beat \"NFL GameDay\" to fully polygonal graphics, concluding that \"despite some problems, at least the gameplay is solid – a distinct improvement over last year. However, it's too little too late, and stacked against the jaw-dropping \"GameDay\", good is no longer good enough.\" \"GameSpot\" countered that \"Although some might scoff at \"Madden 98\" not using polygons like its chief competitor \"GameDay 98\", these player sprites are well animated and detailed.\", and pointed out several impressive graphical features accomplished with the sprites. Arguing that the excellent gameplay and AI outweigh the graphical shortcomings, Kujawa deemed \"Madden NFL 98\" \"the best PlayStation football game\", while his co-reviewer Dean Hager, like \"Next Generation\", held that \"GameDay 98\" had edged it out with its polygonal players.\n\nWhile most reviewers did not compare versions, \"GamePro\" noted that the Saturn version has greater pixelation than the PlayStation version and uses an antiquated \"gliding sprites\" method of animation. Despite this, the Saturn's much smaller library of football games (Sega's only answer to Sony's \"NFL GameDay\" was the critically panned \"NFL '97\") left critics with few reservations about declaring the Saturn version of \"Madden NFL '98\" the best football game on the system.\n\nIn the same issue in which they reviewed the Saturn version (and just a month after reviewing the PlayStation version), \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" ranked the Saturn and PlayStation versions as the 19th best console video game of all time, saying that the AI was the best of any football game yet.\n"}
{"id": "2146505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146505", "title": "The Corporate Machine", "text": "The Corporate Machine\n\nThe Corporate Machine (known in Europe as Business Tycoon) is a business simulation computer game from Stardock in which the goal is to create a corporation in one of four industries (automobiles, aircraft, computers, or soft drinks) and eventually dominate rival companies. To win the player must dominate the chosen market (getting 55% to 65% of the market share depending on the number of opponents). The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon, which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur, all developed by Stardock.\n\nWhen starting a game, the player picks a company specialty. Three specialties are available: marketing, labor and research. Each specialty doubles productivity in that area. After picking a specialty, the start screen allows choice of how many opponents to be faced, the difficulty of the game, what map will be used (both real and fictional maps are available), starting funds, and what industry is to be competed in.\n\nThe game is started at the home site (which is randomly chosen on the map) and with one sales executive. To introduce and sell the product to other regions, the region must be investigated. This process can take from 3 to 10 weeks depending on how far they are from the sites. After an area is explored, the player will know the market leader, if opponents have sites or units there, if the region has a resource, as well as statistics like what the targeted area desires in a product, their concerns with price, and how rich the region is.\n\nThe sales executives increase market penetration (the percentage of stores carrying the product) in their regions and all regions up to two spaces away from each executive. The sales executive can be moved around the map freely by plane; however, while in transit he will not grant any penetration benefit. To gain more sales executives the profit must be increased to a certain level by the end of a year. This gets harder later on as the amount to gain a new executive increases. It is also possible to get them through the use of Direct Action Cards.\n\nThese places are the player's base of operations. Manufacturing, research, and marketing buildings can be built and upgraded. Additional sites can be purchased but they become progressively more expensive. On the player's first site there will be a sales office and a garage, but every site after will only have a sales office and everything else has to be built. Other buildings include an intelligence facility, which will generate and display information in the form of graphs. Company stores can be built at any site to decrease employee expenses (and therefore lower employee cost).\n\nTo get better performance a training center will increase employee efficiency. Employee happiness becomes a factor as well, as an unhappy employee's performance will suffer, so a recreation center will boost morale. If market leadership is lost in an area where a site is, the employees' morale will drop sharply. Marketing, manufacturing, and researching buildings can be accessed in order to make adjustments to the multiple operations within the company. Sales buildings act similarly to sales executives that cannot be moved from region to region.\n\nWhen a marketing building is built, it will be possible to hire and fire marketers. Marketing associates can be used to create marketing campaigns. As campaigns are created, marketing associate availability drops and the player is forced to build more marketing buildings in order to have more campaigns. These buildings can be upgraded to have more employees and to have more powerful marketing campaigns. Positive campaigns will boost the qualities of the player's product, or negative marketing campaigns to decrease the appeal of an opponents product. For media, there are advertisements to print, and radio and television campaigns. Marketing campaigns can be moved from region to region similarly to a sales executive.\n\nStarting with a simple garage, the player can upgrade to factories. Larger factories, and hire of additional employees, increase efficiency. Employees can be hired or fired as demand rises or falls. The production screen is where the price of the product is set. If the product is better compared to other companies then an overcharge can be made. The price should not be raised too far as demand will drop quickly if there are different companies in the same area and market leadership could be lost.\n\nThis is where scientists develop new technologies to upgrade the product. The bigger the research building, the more scientists can be hired. Four projects can be queued so the player does not have to constantly have to come back to the screen and choose new technologies. Different projects also give different bonuses, such as decreasing the cost to manufacture or increase the appeal to consumers.\n\nDifferent regions may or may not have a resource in them. There are five resource types: Labor, Government, Intelligence, Marketing, and Underworld. Every year that a region is controlled that has a resource is one resource point. Having resource points allows the play of direct action cards.\n\nThe game is started with two cards and an additional card is received every year. Direct action cards cost resources, and may have a monetary cost in addition. Cards have effects such as receiving money from the government, a research boon, revealing large blocks of regions, twisting the desires of consumers, physical destruction of competitors assets, cutting costs through illegal activities, and publicity boosts. The direct action card system has been likened to the card game .\n\nThe Corporate Machine's popularity has decreased over the years since the game was first introduced. Recently a fan of the game (known as Money) has tried to reunite the TCM community by creating a forum, tutorials, help, and support.\n\nThe problem that the community is facing is that Stardock's TCM server (which allows users to play online) is down often, disabling internet play.\n\nThe community is considering creating a new, more reliable server on which to play (see external links).\n\nThe game received \"favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n"}

Its signal is relayed across Arizona on a network of 13 translator stations.\n\nKAET was launched on January 30, 1961, as an affiliate for National Educational Television. Its programming originally consisted of educational programming directed at students attending ASU but its focus eventually widened along with that of PBS. In the mid-1990s, when the Phoenix market was undergoing a significant realignment of network affiliations, KAET was one of two major English-language stations (the other being KPNX) that did not change. In June 1999, KAET was issued a permit to construct digital television facilities on UHF channel 29.

In 2006, the station relaunched as \"Eight, Arizona PBS\" (stylized as \"ei8ht\" in logos). When spoken, the moniker was similar to Five in the United Kingdom. This brand was dropped in 2015 in favor of simply \"Arizona PBS.\"\n\nDue to the effects from the late-2000s recession, fundraising efforts at KAET have consistently fallen behind projections, resulting in two major rounds of layoffs. The first round came in late October 2008, when the station, having missed its fundraising targets by hundreds of thousands of dollars, had to lay off six workers. The second round of layoffs came in April 2009, when 13 workers were laid off.\n\nThe financial crisis also delayed KAET's move to its new headquarters in downtown Phoenix; they moved there by late 2009.\n\nKAET produces several of its programs in-house, such as its current events program, \"Horizon\", its Hispanic-focused current events counterpart, \"Horizonte\", and its \"Arizona Collection\" documentaries about the people, places and history of the state.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba on three occasions: from 1915 to 1920, 1922 to 1936, and 1941 to 1945.\n\nSigfusson was born to an Icelandic family living in Nordfjordur, Iceland. He was educated at home and came to Canada in 1887 to work as a farmer and rancher. He married Gudrun Arnason, daughter of Arnor Arnason, of Chicago, in January 1908. They had seven children: Arthur F. Sigfusson, E. Maria Sigfusson, Svein O. Sigfusson, Skuli A. Sigfusson, Sigurdur Jon (Siggi) Sigfusson, Olaf Sigfusson(McMahon), Thomas Sigfusson. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election.\n\nAs Liberal, he lost the constituency of St. George to Conservative Edmund L. Taylor by 101 votes.\n\nThe Conservative government of Rodmond Roblin was forced to resign amid scandal in early 1915. Sigfusson ran again in that year's provincial election, and defeated his Conservative opponent Paul Reykdal by 460 votes. The Liberals won a landslide victory in this election, and Sigfusson served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's government.\n\nManitoba's political culture changed significantly between 1915 and 1920, after the Winnipeg General Strike and the rise of labour politics. Sigfusson lost his seat to Albert Kristjansson of the Labour Party in the 1920 provincial election, as the Liberals were reduced to a precarious minority government.\n\nThe Liberals were defeated in the 1922 provincial election. Despite the provincial trend against his party, however, Sigfusson was returned to the legislature via a convincing victory over Kristjansson, who had left the Labour Party to join the United Farmers of Manitoba. He was re-elected over both Reykdal and Kristjansson in the 1927 election.\n\nIn 1932, the Liberals joined with the Progressive Party of Manitoba to create a \"Liberal-Progressive\" alliance. Sigfusson was re-elected under this banner in the 1932 provincial election, defeating a Conservative opponent by 500 votes. He again served as a government backbencher, supporting the government of John Bracken.\n\nIn the 1936 provincial election, Sigfusson was upset by Salome Halldorson of the upstart Social Credit League. He ran again in the 1941 election, however, and defeated Halldorson by a significant margin.\n\nSigfusson retired from the legislature in 1945. He died in 1969, at age ninety-nine.\n"}
{"id": "2146535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146535", "title": "Garabogazköl", "text": "Garabogazköl\n\nThe Garabogazköl Aylagy or Kara-Bogaz-Gol (, black (or mighty) strait lake) is a shallow inundated depression in the northwestern corner of Turkmenistan. It forms a lagoon of the Caspian Sea with a surface area of about . It is separated from the Caspian Sea proper, which lies immediately to the west, by a narrow, rocky ridge having a very narrow opening in the rock through which the Caspian waters flow, cascading down into Garabogazköl, leading to the Turkmen language name of the bay, \"Mighty Strait Lake\". The water volume of the bay fluctuates seasonally with the Caspian Sea; at times it becomes a large bay of the Caspian Sea, while at other times its water level drops drastically.\n\nThe city of Garabogaz (formerly Bekdaş) lies on the ridge, about north of the channel between the main Caspian basin and the Garabogazköl lagoon. The town has a population of about 10,000.\n\nThe salinity of the bay is about 35%, compared to the Caspian Sea's 1.2%, and 3–4% for the bulk of the world's oceans. Because of the exceptionally high salinity, comparable to the Dead Sea, it has practically no marine vegetation. Large evaporite, mostly salt deposits accumulated at the south shore, were harvested by the local population since the 1920s, but in the 1930s manual collection stopped and the industry shifted northwest to its present center near Garabogaz. From the 1950s on, ground water was pumped from levels lower than the bay itself, yielding more valuable types of salts. In 1963 construction began at Garabogaz on a modern plant for increased production of salines all the year round and independently of natural evaporation. This plant was completed in 1973.\nIn March 1980, the barrier to the Caspian was blocked, due to concerns evaporation was accelerating a fall in Caspian Sea level, reducing water levels. The resulting \"salt bowl\" caused widespread problems of blowing salt, reportedly poisoning the soil and causing health problems for hundreds of kilometers downwind to the east. In 1984 the lake was completely dry. In June 1992, when Caspian Sea levels were rising again, the barrier was breached, allowing Caspian water to again refill Garabogazköl. The remnants of the breached dam can be seen in the satellite photo of the inlet, near the Caspian Sea entrance.\n\nThe bay is also the subject of the \"socialist-realist\" writer Konstantin Paustovsky's, 1932 book \"Kara-Bogaz\", which praised the development of the salt industry in the area by the Soviet government in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1935 the film director Aleksandr Razumny made a film \"Kara-bugaz\" (\"Кара-Бугаз\") based on Konstantin Paustovsky's book, with music by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov. The French communist and journalist Henri Barbusse was given a sneak preview of the almost-finished film, which he praised in an article in Izvestia. Unfortunately the film should have been shown first to Stalin, who became unhappy when he learned of its existence. As a consequence it was never generally released, although it received a screening in London in June 2010.\n\n"}

The cover features Tim Hardaway of the Miami Heat. The game was developed by EA Sports and released on November 30, 1997 for the PlayStation, October 31, 1997 for the PC and December 31, 1997 for the Sega Saturn. It was the final version of NBA Live released for the Super NES, Genesis and Sega Saturn.\n\nThe game introduced various innovations to the series, including the now standard feature of passing to any teammate with a single button press. The game also made various graphical improvements, with new player models and faces modeled after actual player photographs. The PC version introduced support for 3D acceleration, utilizing 3dfx's Glide API. The PlayStation, PC and Saturn versions have Ernie Johnson as studio announcer and TNT/TBS color analyst Verne Lundquist doing play-by-play commentary. However, the Saturn version does not include play-by-play commentary. \"NBA Live 98\" is followed by \"NBA Live 99\".\n\nThe game features rosters from the 1997–98 NBA season. New features include the \"Total Control\" system, that allows players to choose between a dunk or layup or pass to any teammate with the press of a button. \"Tight\" player moves allow players to spin, crossover, back down, ball fake and more on command. Player lock lets players always control a specified player on court.\n\nThough playing during the 1997–98 season, Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan is not featured in the game. (This was because Jordan was not part of the National Basketball Players Association and at the time the cost of licensing his individual name and likeness for video games was approximately $15 million a year, beyond the total budget of most video games.) Jordan is replaced by the fictional \"Roster Player\" in the Bulls lineup. However, Charles Barkley made his first appearance in Live 98 as a member of the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe motion capture of the game was done by NBA players Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, Larry Johnson, Joe Dumars and Christian Laettner.\n\nVarious new modes were introduced. A new GM Mode lets players choose franchises, draft players and play custom seasons. The game also features the Three-Point Shootout, which could be played using full or split screen. Four difficulty levels are available, including a new Superstar difficulty level, along with improved AI with smarter players and more accurate stats.\n\nWith the introduction of 3D players, courts, and jerseys came an opportunity to patch and update these aspects of the game. Programs such as the EA Graphics Editor allowed patchers to update almost every visual aspect of the game with ease. This greatly improved gameplay and sold more NBA live games than any before it.\n\n\"NBA Live 98\" was a runner-up for \"Computer Gaming World\"s 1997 \"Sports Game of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to \"Baseball Mogul\" and \"CART Precision Racing\" (tie). The editors called \"NBA Live 98\" \"the latest and best [...] in EA's awesome action-oriented\" series.\n\n"}
{"id": "2146546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146546", "title": "Need for Speed II", "text": "Need for Speed II\n\nNeed for Speed II is a racing video game released in 1997. It is a part of the \"Need for Speed\" series and is the second installment, following \"The Need for Speed\".\n\nLike its predecessor, \"Need for Speed II\" allows players to race exotic cars in country-themed tracks from North America, Europe, Asia and Australia, either against computer-controlled opponents or human opponents via a LAN, modem, serial connection, or in split screen. There are three distinct gameplay modes: Single Race mode in which a player simply chooses a car and a course and completes a single race. In this mode, the player can customize both the number and type of opponents as well as the number of laps to be completed. Tournament Mode in which the player must complete a series of races successfully to unlock a bonus car. The Knockout Mode consists of a series of 2-lap races with 8 opponents; the last-place finisher at the end of each race is eliminated from the competition.\n\nThe game features eight real life high-end sports cars and concept cars which the player can drive and race against. The \"Special Edition\" release of the game added four additional cars. In addition, the game features a \"showcase\" which provides photos, videos, and technical information about the cars as well as the history of each company and background of each car's development.\n\nThe game also features several new elements compared to the previous game in the form of customizable car paint and components of their car including gear ratios, tires, and spoilers.\n\n\"Need for Speed II\" was developed by EA Canada. The lead programmer for the game was Laurent Ancessi with Wei Shoong Teh and Brad Gour as senior programmers.\n\nEA abandoned the \"Road & Track\" license used with the original game in favor of licensing with each automobile manufacturer individually. To ensure the physics of fast car handling and performance were as accurate as possible, the programmers collaborated with the manufactures of each vehicle. The sound effects were created by installing microphones in various positions on each car and recording onto eight track digital tape while the car was driven. \n\nA version for the Panasonic M2 was in the works but it was never released due to the cancellation of the system.\n\n\"Need for Speed II\" was met with mixed reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation version 71.39% and 71/100 and the PC version 68.25%. Critics were universally impressed with the selection of expensive cars and the huge number of tracks. However, most found that other issues interfered with enjoyment of the game. IGN, for instance, remarked that \"All the right elements are there - cool cars, inventive tracks, decent control - but the execution has been seriously flawed by poor graphics and frame rate.\" The most commonly cited problem with the graphics was the high amount of pop-in, which \"Next Generation\" said \"is actually irritating enough to obfuscate what could be a good time.\" The Official PlayStation Magazine said the game had \"atrocious handling\" and that it soon got boring. Several critics noted, usually in the form of a complaint, that the game's handling requires players to frequently brake during turns.\n\nThere was considerable disagreement over the game's blend of realistic and arcade-style racing. In \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", Kraig Kujawa and Dean Hager's criticism of the game stemmed from its being easier to play and therefore less realistic than its predecessor. Kujawa added that the game \"has been given an arcade edge that simply doesn't fit. The cartoony-looking graphics are subpar, because they ruin the realistic feel of driving these real, exotic cars.\" \"GamePro\", however, stated the reverse, that the gameplay was too realistic to appeal to fans of arcade-style racing, and could only be recommended to players who enjoyed games like \"Formula 1\" and the original \"Need for Speed\". \"GameSpot\"s Glenn Rubenstein offered a third opinion, saying it provides a unique middle-ground between realism and arcade style by allowing players to drive real cars with realistic handling into exotic populated areas. He also praised the music and sound effects, and while acknowledging the issues with the graphics, he found them overall impressive, and concluded \"Need for Speed II\" to be \"the PlayStation's slickest racer yet\".\n\nThe PC version was slightly less well-received. An issue was that the game required a fast computer at the time, to display the graphics at the highest setting. A reviewer for Computer and Video Games didn't appreciate the combination of super realist cars being driven on fantasy tracks and thought that the crashes \"look and feel wrong\". Tasos Kaiafas of \"GameSpot\" liked the game but felt most of the roads were \"outrageous\" and that the cars would be unfamiliar to many. An Adrenaline Vault review described the game as a \"good overall driving experience\" with easy installation, realistic sound effects and both an excellent interface and music.\n\nA 2007 retrospective review in \"The Game Goldies\" praised the crisper graphics, smoother animation, rich colors and increased detail compared to the original.\n\nReleased on October 29, 1997 in the United States and February 2, 1998 in Japan and Europe, the special edition of \"Need for Speed II\" includes one extra race track, three extra cars, three bonus cars, a new driving style called \"Wild\", and 3dfx Glide hardware acceleration support.\n"}

Completing races earns the player credits which are used to buy new cars for new events and to upgrade old cars to make events a little easier. Completing races also unlocks the tracks for single race purposes, and completing Tournament events unlocks the Special Event events. Beating all events of Tournament or Special Events will unlock one of two secret cars to purchase; the player also gets a free sample at the same time.\n\nThe PC version is somewhat different, starting with having everything under a clear \"Career Mode\". All events are split into \"tiers\", a selection of 1 to 5 individual competitions. Usually, one of those competitions is a \"High Stakes\" race, where the player bets their current car.\n\nIn High Stakes, two racers bet their cars on a duel; the winner of the race keeps their car and gains the loser's. The player or players must own more than one car to participate in a High Stakes race.\n\nIn addition to the \"Classic\" mode, which plays similarly to the previous \"Hot Pursuit\", \"High Stakes\" introduces \"Getaway\" and \"Time Trap\" modes. In Getaway, the speeder must evade the police or the police must catch the speeder within the time limit. If the speeder has not been arrested when time is up, the player has the option to quit to the Race Results menu or to continue play for as long as possible. In Time Trap, the speeder must complete a race or the police must arrest all racers (ten in the PS version) within the time limit. The police can set up spike strips and road blocks, and even call for backup.\n\nIn the German market, \"Need for Speed: High Stakes\" PlayStation version received a \"Gold\" award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) by the end of July 1999, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\n\"Need for Speed: High Stakes\" received positive reviews from critics upon release, mostly for the new features such as vehicle damage, vehicle customization and the new career mode, as well as for its exciting police chases. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation version 84.38% and 86/100, and GameRankings gave the PC version 83.08%. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the PS version a score of 30 out of 40. In the UK, \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\" gave the same version eight out of ten'. However, \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\" also said that (like its previous installment) it could not compete with other racing titles such as \"Gran Turismo\" and \"\".\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"\"High Stakes\" has taken the impressive gains of \"Hot Pursuit\" and added more than enough new features and modes to attract series fans and newcomers alike. If you like fast cars – or just running from the cops – you'll love this game.\"\n\nBuck DeFore reviewed the PC version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"Greater than the sum of its parts, \"High Stakes\" has fun where it counts – in spades.\"\n\n\"High Stakes\" was named the best racing game of 1999 by CNET Gamecenter.

{"id": "2146551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146551", "title": "Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed", "text": "Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed\n\nNeed for Speed: Porsche Unleashed, released as Need for Speed: Porsche 2000 in Europe and Need for Speed: Porsche in Latin America, and Germany, is a racing video game released in 2000. It is the fifth installment in the \"Need for Speed\" series. Unlike other \"NFS\" titles, \"Porsche Unleashed\" centers on racing Porsche sports cars, with models ranging from 1950 to 2000. Unlike the previous four \"Need for Speed\" games, \"Porsche Unleashed\" was not released in Japan.\n\n\"Need for Speed: Porsche\" \"Unleashed\" gives the player the opportunity to race Porsche cars (including 3 race cars) throughout a range of tracks located in Europe. There are two career modes, an evolution mode, where the player starts with Porsche cars made in 1955, and ends with Porsche cars made in 2000, and factory driver mode, where the player goes through a series of events like slalom, stunts, and races, using Porsche cars preselected for each event. The player can customize their cars drawing from an in-depth catalog of different Porsche as well as aftermarket parts. Unlike previous games in the series, there are no pursuit modes. Some factory driver events include police cars, but the police cars only attempt to impede the players car during certain sprint events.\n\nThe factory driver mode introduces the first storyline in the Need For Speed series. The player's goal is to become a Porsche factory driver by completing a series of events. The game uses pop-up windows, each with an image of an existing Porsche factory team member, and text describing the next event, and also commenting on the player's progress. In some cases, a timed course such as a slalom notes the required time to pass, but also mentions the current team record, where beating the record is optional and the post event pop-up will note if the player set a new record or not. The events involve stunts, like doing two 180 degree spins (the first one leaves the players car driving backwards for a bit), slalom courses, delivery (time limited sprints with police that interfere with the player's car), normal sprint and circuit races.\n\nAn additional online-only conversion of \"Porsche Unleashed\", dubbed Need for Speed: Top Speed, was released in response to both the release of MacGillivray Freeman's 2002 IMAX film, \"Top Speed\", and the Porsche Cayenne. The game features three existing tracks from \"Porsche Unleashed\" and three Porsche vehicles: the 911 (996) Turbo, the 959 and the Cayenne Turbo.\n\nAccess to \"Need for Speed: Top Speed\" was bundled alongside the PC version of \"\".\n\nThe \"40 Jahre 911 Bundle\" was released on November 13, 2003 and was only available in Germany. It was a special 40th anniversary edition for the Porsche 911.\n\nThe CD box is packed in a unique metal box with the game itself patched to version 3.4. Also included is the official soundtrack of the game, although no additional game features were included.\n\n\"Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed\" received mixed to positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Microsoft Windows version 84.36%, the PlayStation version 74.50% and 78/100 and the Game Boy Advance version 59.25% and 62/100 In the UK, \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\" gave the PS version eight out of ten and liked its structure, but said that many of the 70 cars were indistinguishable, and criticised the lifespan. They described the handling as \"arcadey\", and warned people who didn't like Porsches to \"steer well clear\".\n\nDoug Trueman reviewed the PC version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"Though there's nothing wrong with it, there's little to separate \"Porsche Unleashed\" from the rest of the current pack of competent PC racers.\"\n\n\"PC Gamer US\" named \"Porsche Unleashed\" the best racing game of 2000.\n\nIn the United States, \"Porsche Unleashed\"s computer version sold 74,795 units by the end of 2000. This accounted for $2.58 million in revenue. Domestic sales rose to 340,000 copies, for revenues of $6.3 million, by August 2006. At the time, this led \"Edge\" to declare \"Porsche Unleashed\" the country's 52nd-best-selling computer game released since January 2000.\n\nIn the German market, \"Porsche Unleashed\" debuted at #4 on 's computer game sales rankings for March 2000. Securing fifth place the following month, it proceeded to remain in the top 20 through June, before dropping to 27th in July and 39th in August. Sales in the region totaled roughly 65,000 units by late 2000, a figure with which Electronic Arts was \"not dissatisfied\", according to \"PC Player\"s Udo Hoffman. However, he noted that the title had underperformed compared to its predecessors, and was part of a downturn in computer game sales that year.\n\n"}
{"id": "2146552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146552", "title": "V-Rally (video game)", "text": "V-Rally (video game)\n\nV-Rally is a racing video game developed by Infogrames Multimedia and released for the PlayStation console in 1997. The first game in the \"V-Rally\" series, it is based on the 1997 and 1998 World Rally Championship seasons, and features officially licensed cars and tracks inspired by real locations of rally events. Players drive rally cars through a series of stages spread over eight different locations, ranging from European countries like England, Spain or Sweden, to island countries such as Indonesia and New Zealand. As a simulation game, \"V-Rally\" places a strong emphasis on replicating the behavior physics of real cars and generally requires more practice than arcade-style racers.\n\nThe game was developed over the course of nearly two years by a team that would later be known as Eden Studios. Ex-rally world champion Ari Vatanen gave the developers insight on how the cars should handle collisions and drifts. Upon release, the game was critically and commercially successful in Europe, selling more than two million copies as of November 1998. However, the game was not very successful in North America. Critics generally praised its large number of tracks and challenging yet rewarding gameplay, but some criticized its overly-sensitive and difficult controls. After its release on the PlayStation console, \"V-Rally\" was ported to multiple platforms, including the Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, and Microsoft Windows. A sequel, \"V-Rally 2\", was released in 1999.\n\n\"V-Rally\" is a racing simulation game where players drive rally cars through a series of stages or tracks. The game places a strong emphasis on replicating the behavior physics of real cars and generally requires more practice than arcade-style racers. Aspects such as the weather conditions, the road surfaces, and the drive wheel configurations have a significant impact on the car handling. Weather conditions include rain and snow, while road surfaces range from asphalt to gravel or dirt. Races can take place at night or during the day. The game features both Kit Cars and World Rally Cars for players to choose from. Kit Cars are two-wheel drive and include cars such as the Peugeot 306 Maxi or Renault Maxi Megane, while World Rally Cars are four-wheel drive and include cars such as the Subaru Impreza WRC or Mitsubishi Lancer WRC. Before starting a race, players have the option to tweak their car setup with tighter suspensions, quicker gear ratios, understeer or oversteer sensitivity, and choice of manual or automatic transmission.\n\nThe game features three gameplay modes: Arcade, Championship, and Time Trial. In Arcade, players race against opponents controlled by the game's artificial intelligence in three series of stages. Each series must be completed in a linear fashion and its stages have multiple checkpoints that must be reached in a specified time. Players start with three credits and, if they lose a stage or fail to reach a checkpoint, they will lose one credit. If players run out of credits, the game will be over. However, players can get additional credits by winning individual stages. Championship is similar to Arcade, but stages have no checkpoints and players are awarded points based on the rank they finish courses. The game offers more than 40 stages spread over eight different locations, ranging from European countries like England, Spain or Sweden, to island countries such as Indonesia and New Zealand. Time Trial allows players to race on any stage and record the fastest lap time. All three modes support one or two players. If two players compete against each other, a split screen feature is used.\n\n\"V-Rally\" was developed for the PlayStation console by an Infogrames team based in Lyon, France. This team, composed of 20 full-time people, would later be known as Eden Studios. Because the PlayStation development kits did not cover the requirements needed for the game, the developers decided to create their own programming tools, including the game engine. The game's environments and cars are fully rendered in 3D, while the Gouraud shading method was used to give 3D objects a smoother surface. All the cars that are featured in the game were officially licensed, including their stickers. Former rally world champion Ari Vatanen gave the developers insight on how the cars should handle collisions and drifts. Vatanen noted that, although each car practically features the same control concepts, there are significant differences between two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive vehicles. The game supports the NeGcon controller by Namco, allowing players to steer their car around curves in an analog manner.\n\nOriginally, the game was intended to feature a level editor where players could create their own tracks by modifying variables such as road surface, road curves, and weather conditions. It would take the PlayStation between 30 and 60 seconds to render these tracks, which could be saved in a memory card. This option would allow players to update their game with additional tracks. Eventually, an editor would be included in the 1999 sequel \"V-Rally 2\". Although the game's tracks are fictitious, they were inspired by real locations of rally events, such as the Rally Costa Brava in Spain. With the use of the PlayStation Link Cable, a 4 player multiplayer mode was initially planned. Similarly, developers considered the possibility of adding a rear-view mirror to the HUD, but it was ultimately discarded due to the memory constraints of the PlayStation hardware. The game's hard rock score was recorded at the Moby Dick club in Madrid. The overall development of the game took almost two years to complete. The V in the game's title stands for \"Virtual\".\n\nBased on the 1997 World Rally Championship, \"V-Rally\" was first released in Europe in July 1997 as \"V-Rally: 97 Championship Edition\". In North America, the game was published by Electronic Arts and released on November 4, 1997 as \"Need for Speed: V-Rally\". Although the game has no connection to the \"Need for Speed\" series, it is presumed that the reason for the title change was to draw more attention to the American market, as rallying is much more popular in Europe than in America. Unlike the European version, the American version includes the Toyota Corolla WRC as a new car. A Platinum version that supports the DualShock controller and includes the Toyota Corolla WRC was released in Europe in 1998 as \"V-Rally: Championship Edition\".\n\nIn Europe, \"V-Rally\" received very positive reviews from critics, who compared it favorably to \"Sega Rally Championship\", praising its large number of tracks and challenging yet rewarding gameplay. \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" described \"V-Rally\" as \"a huge game, by far the most comprehensive racer on [the PlayStation] or any other platform since Psygnosis' \"F1\"\", while \"Edge\" credited it for adopting a different style from other PlayStation racing games such as \"Rage Racer\", a market the magazine considered overcrowded at the time. Editors of the French video game magazine \"Consoles +\" considered \"V-Rally\" the most effective rally simulation game they had ever played.\n\n\"Computer and Video Games\" editors felt that the simulation aspects give \"V-Rally\" a lot of depth, but remarked that the game is not as instantly accessible as \"Sega Rally\" and that its highly sensitive controls can frustrate some players. They also considered \"V-Rally\" a more attractive game due to its better-looking graphics, which were highlighted for their details and long draw distance. The replay value was seen as one of the game's strongest points, mainly because of the variety of tracks and weather conditions. The Spanish video game magazine \"HobbyConsolas\" noted the game's varied scenery, stating that each track offers unique challenges. Although the magazine said it can take some time to get used to the controls, the effort is ultimately rewarding due to the game's \"impressive\" sense of speed.\n\nIn North America, reviews were not as positive. \"GameSpot\" condemned the controls, saying that the cars \"spin out much, much too easily, and even with understeering turned all the way up in the options, the cars still tend to go wild.\" Although the website highlighted the game's \"impressive\" number of cars and tracks, especially when compared to most games of the time, it concluded that the game is not worth playing due to its \"shoddy control\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" editors agreed, describing the car physics and collision detection as wacky and unnatural. Other publications were more positive towards the game. \"Game Revolution\" enjoyed the fact that weather conditions impact the gameplay experience, stressing that \"once you understand that you actually need to use your brakes and concentrate on the race, the realism proves to be a great asset\", while \"IGN\" felt that the game was highly rewarding and fun, and that it is best experienced when played on higher difficulty settings.\n\nIn Europe, \"V-Rally\" was a commercial success, selling 15,000 copies during its first weekend of release. In the UK, the game was a bestseller for three months, and in August 1998, the game received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. As of November 1998, \"V-Rally\" had sold more than two million copies worldwide. It took home a \"Gold\" prize at the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, for revenues above €22 million in the European Union during 1998.\n\nAfter its release on the PlayStation console, \"V-Rally\" was ported to multiple platforms. An updated version based on the 1998 World Rally Championship, developed by Eden Studios and entitled \"V-Rally: Edition '99\", was released for the Nintendo 64 console in Europe on December 1998, and in North America in September 1999. Presented at the 1998 European Computer Trade Show and later at the 1999 Nintendo Space World show, the Nintendo 64 version features several improvements over the original, including a revised physics engine for better vehicle feel and control. Unlike the PlayStation version, the Nintendo 64 version fits in a 96-megabit cartridge, but does not feature any music during gameplay. The game generally received more positive reviews in Europe than in North America. Criticism was targeted at its late draw-in graphics and floaty car physics, but some critics highlighted the fact that the game includes more than 50 tracks. Because the North American version was released nearly one year later than the European version, \"IGN\" felt that Nintendo 64 standards improved significantly with racing games such as \"World Driver Championship\" or \"Beetle Adventure Racing\", and that the game would certainly have been judged differently one year earlier.\n\nA single-player, portable adaptation of the game was released for the original Game Boy in Europe in July 1998, featuring Mode 7-like graphics and the Arcade and Championship modes, with a total of four cars and ten tracks. An updated version of the Game Boy game was released for the Game Boy Color in Europe in April 1999 as \"V-Rally: Championship Edition\", and in North America in July 1999 as \"V-Rally: Edition '99\". Although the Game Boy Color version is not backward compatible with the Game Boy, it is essentially the same as the Game Boy version, but offers colorful graphics and 20 tracks. Both versions were developed by VD-dev. A Microsoft Windows version, entitled \"V-Rally: Multiplayer Championship Edition\", was released in Europe in June 1999. It is similar to the original PlayStation version, but features sharper textures and supports online play. Later, a Symbian version of the game developed by Ideaworks3D was released for mobile phones such as the Sony Ericsson P800 and P900.\n\n"}

{"id": "2146579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146579", "title": "Steve Hodge", "text": "Steve Hodge\n\nStephen Brian Hodge (born 25 October 1962) is an English retired footballer who played as a midfielder. He enjoyed a high-profile club and international career in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nPrior to the 2013–14 season Hodge was appointed Development Squad Coach at Notts County.\n\nOn 27 October 2013 Hodge was appointed caretaker manager, reverting to his position as Development Squad Coach on 6 November 2013 with the appointment of Shaun Derry as manager.\n\nHodge, a left-footed midfielder who was comfortable in a central or wide position, was born in Nottingham, England and joined his boyhood club Nottingham Forest as an apprentice in 1980 and made his debut against Ipswich Town on the final day of the 1981–82 season.\n\nA favourite of Forest's charismatic manager Brian Clough, Hodge became a first-team regular the following season as the club tried to build a new young team after the side which won two European Cups began to age and disintegrate. Hodge was a frequent goalscorer from midfield as Forest consolidated their League position were unable to push for trophies other than a semi-final in the UEFA Cup in 1984, where they lost in controversial circumstances to Anderlecht.\n\nIn the summer of 1985, Forest surprisingly accepted an offer of £450,000 from Aston Villa and Hodge – whose nickname was Harry – made his move from the East Midlands to the West Midlands.\n\nHowever, the move to Villa did work initially but really the team was in decline and once he had got England recognition it was perceived by the Villa fans that he was not committed to the Villa cause which was typified during a 4–1 home defeat by Norwich City where he his intended back pass to Kevin Poole was slotted in by a Norwich player – the boos ringing round the ground signalled the beginning of the end for his Villa career. Hodge signed for Tottenham in December 1986 for £650,000.\n\nThough he was only three caps into his international career by the time Robson announced his squad, Hodge was given a place on the plane to Mexico, coming on as a substitute in the first two group games against Portugal and Morocco, which England lost and drew respectively.\n\nMaking urgent changes for the final group game against Poland, Robson put Hodge in the side and he responded with an outstanding personal display within a crushing team performance. Hodge's superb left wing cross on the run gave Gary Lineker his second goal in a first half hat-trick which eased England's passage to the second round.\n\nThere they faced Paraguay, and it was a sliding, stretching Hodge who kept in an over-hit cross from Glenn Hoddle, by pushing the ball into the path of Lineker to tap home. Again England were 3–0 victors, with Argentina awaiting ominously in the last eight. Here Hodge would earn his own mildly dubious place in England's history – inadvertently setting up Maradona's 'Hand of God' goal – and a highly prized memento, Maradona's No. 10 shirt.\n\nHodge retained his place in the team as England began their qualification campaign for the 1988 European Championships with victories over Northern Ireland and Yugoslavia.\n\nTottenham manager David Pleat put Hodge wide on the left of a vibrant, attacking five-man midfield which also included England teammates Hoddle and Chris Waddle, Argentinian veteran Osvaldo Ardiles and hardworking ballwinner Paul Allen. Each were expected to contribute goals and assists behind one main centre forward, Clive Allen, and it worked. Hodge scored on his debut on Boxing Day 1986 in a 4–0 thrashing of West Ham United and scored three times more while creating plenty for others as Spurs chased three trophies.\n\nSadly for Hodge, his quest for domestic success eluded him again as Spurs were knocked out by fierce rivals Arsenal in the semi finals of the League Cup, tailed off in their First Division title charge and came third, and lost a thrilling FA Cup final at Wembley against Coventry City, following an outstanding 4–1 semi-final win over Watford in which Hodge scored twice.\n\nRobson recalled Hodge for the first game after the European Championships – a 1–0 win over Denmark at Wembley – as Hodge had been back on form after an astute Clough paid Spurs £550,000 to take him back to Nottingham Forest. Hodge was again cast aside internationally afterwards, but his club form improved dramatically and he found himself regularly called up by Robson as a result, though actual appearances were scarce.\n\nForest won the Full Members Cup in 1989 and then reached the League Cup final, with Hodge finally winning a major domestic medal. The 3–1 win over Luton Town at Wembley saw Hodge play a crucial part as it was he, making a foraging run from deep, who was brought down for the penalty which Nigel Clough converted, setting Forest on the road to victory. A week later, however, Hodge was one of the Forest players who had to cope with the horrors of the Hillsborough disaster during the opening minutes of their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Hodge played in the rescheduled game at Old Trafford, which Liverpool won 3–1.\n\nThe following season, Hodge played as Forest retained the League Cup with a 1–0 win over Oldham Athletic, having managed to force his way back into the England reckoning with a strong appearance as a substitute against Italy at Wembley, by which time England's place at the 1990 FIFA World Cup was secured. Hodge subsequently played in the final four warm-up matches before the tournament itself.\n\nTo his delight, Hodge then made the final squad but he then suffered an injury and, as a consequence, the ignominy of being the only outfield England player not to kick a ball during the tournament, even though England reached the semi-finals. He didn't even regain his fitness in time to get on the pitch for the third-place play-off game.\n\nRobson quit after the World Cup and Hodge was not selected initially by successor Graham Taylor. At the time he was struggling to hold down a regular place in the Forest midfield after the emergence of teenage Irish phenomenon Roy Keane to partner Garry Parker, who had become the first-choice central midfielder despite being the only one of the three never to play international football.\n\nTaylor brought Hodge back for a 2–0 win over Cameroon early in 1991 and he was then given his 24th cap in a 1–0 win against Turkey in İzmir in a qualifier for the 1992 European Championships. He had, however, lost his Forest place by then and was only named as a substitute by Clough for the 1991 FA Cup Final against his old club Tottenham Hotspur. Hodge came on as a second-half substitute but Spurs ran out 2–1 winners after extra time.\n\nIn the summer, Clough sold him to Leeds United for £900,000 – the highest transfer fee Hodge had commanded even though he was seemingly past his best and had seen his international career almost certainly brought to an end. He struggled to win a regular place at Elland Road, though played enough times in his first season to earn a First Division championship medal. That season he made 23 appearances and scored 7 goals; his goal tally included two braces in games against Sheffield United (won 4-3) and Southampton (drew 3-3) and the only goal in a 1-0 win over Liverpool.\n\nHe had a loan spell with Derby County.\n\nHe joined Queens Park Rangers for a nominal fee in 1994. Two seasons followed with Hodge playing just 15 times.\n\nNext he joined Watford. He played twice for them in the 1995–96 season.\n\nAn unsuccessful trial at Walsall came in the autumn of 1996, followed by a brief spell playing in Hong Kong. He signed for Division Three side Leyton Orient in March 1998, playing just once before finally retiring from playing at the end of the season.\n\nHaving gained an A coaching licence Hodge worked with Roy McFarland at Chesterfield.\n\nHe had brief roles at Notts County as development squad manager, and as caretaker manager of the first team.\n\nIn 2010 Hodge released an autobiography entitled, \"The Man With Maradona's Shirt\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The game received generally positive reviews, although some criticised its similarity to the original. \"Ridge Racer Revolution\" was followed by a sequel, \"Rage Racer\", in 1996.\n\nThe gameplay system remains unchanged from \"Ridge Racer\", the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; running out of time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like \"Ridge Racer 2\". The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. \"Ridge Racer Revolution\" supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. \"Ridge Racer Revolution\" adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available at the start of the game. \"Ridge Racer Revolution\" features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original \"Ridge Racer\"'s courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.\n\nLike the first \"Ridge Racer\", the player normally starts with four cars. The remaining eight are selectable on winning the mini game before the title screen (the mini game is \"Galaga '88\" instead of the original game's \"Galaxian\"). They are mostly unchanged; their names (certain cars are named after other Namco titles) and specifications are similar to the first game. After the player wins the first three circuits, reversed versions are unlocked, and Time Trial features an additional opponent driving a secret car. There are three secret cars; the '13th Racing' (from the first \"Ridge Racer\") of the Novice course, and the new '13th Racing Kid' (of the Intermediate course) and 'White Angel' (of the Expert course). These cars are unlocked upon winning the respective course's Time Trial race.\n\n\"Ridge Racer Revolution\" features two hidden modes; 'Drift Contest', where points are earned according to how well spins are performed on certain corners, and 'Pretty Racer' (also known as 'Buggy mode'), in which the cars size appears with deformed body sizes, similar to Choro-Q cars, which led to the arcade game \"Pocket Racer\". Mirrored tracks that function identically to the original game are accessible. Like the first game, a music CD can be inserted and listened to instead of the soundtrack. Unlike the first game, only the last course played is loaded into the PlayStation's memory; to switch, the game disc needs to be reinserted before loading.\n\n\"Ridge Racer Revolution\" was developed over eight months by a team of more than twenty people, most of whom joined just for \"Ridge Racer Revolution\". The biggest difficulties were the link-up mode, rear-view mirror, and running the game at high speeds. Each member had worked on other console games, and they commented that the graphics detail showed the improvements in skill and technique. The team wanted players to enjoy a more in-depth game than the original, so rather than develop a port of \"Ridge Racer 2\", as many features as possible were added. The early designs for the new courses were made in a 'free run' programme, and used to see how fast the cars went. The rear-view mirror was added primarily with the two player link-up mode in mind. The music was mostly taken from \"Ridge Racer 2\", and as a result, the sound was finished more quickly than the game. Soundtrack composition for \"Ridge Racer 2\" involved Shinji Hosoe, Nobuyoshi Sano, Ayako Saso, and Takayuki Aihara, although new tracks were composed by Hiroshi Okubo and Nobuhide Isayama. The team kept exploring the PlayStation's capabilities to solve the high speed problem, although were confident it was possible. The designer, Hiroyuki Onada, commented that designing an original course was a challenge, and director Kazumi Mizuno believed that graphics quality would be degraded with a split-screen multiplayer mode, so the team decided to focus on the PlayStation's link-up instead.\n\nThe game was a bestseller in the UK. The additional features and improvements over the original in particular were given high praise. \"Coming Soon Magazine\" praised its multiplayer mode, saying it \"will furnish many hours of competitive fun!\", and in their conclusion remarked that the game \"is an excellent racing game that will yield much excitement and challenges\". A reviewer from Absolute PlayStation concurred with this by praising its playability, its \"greatly\" improved artificial Intelligence, and the two-player link-up feature. Both of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s sports reviewers thought that \"Ridge Racer Revolution\" is better than the original, due to the cleaner graphics and improved handling on the cars, which it was believed makes them easier to control. David Hodgson of \"Maximum\" acknowledged the similarity to the original \"Ridge Racer\" but gave it a strong recommendation, arguing that removal of the slowdown and track updating of the original, the unlockables, and the two-player mode make it worth buying. His conclusion was that the game is \"an instantly playable arcade racer that oozes options and playability\".\n\nThe Electric Playground reviewer complimented the additions and improvements, including the \"much improved\" graphics and the scene changes, about which it was commented that it was a \"serious improvement\". It was commented that the colours are \"sharp and pretty\", and the link-up multiplayer mode was lauded, although the remixed music tracks were criticised because they \"pale greatly in comparison to the original tracks\". The new tracks were complimented as \"always challenging and fun to race\" by Gamezilla's Mark Skorupa, who also praised Free Run, saying it's a \"great way to learn the tracks\". Major Mike of \"GamePro\" believed the game surpassed the first and upheld the \"Ridge Racer\" tradition, and \"Computer and Video Games Magazine\" reviewer commented that the game is \"Everything Ridge Racer maniacs could have wanted from a sequel\".\n\nHugh Sterbakov of GameSpot was more critical. He called it \"a clone of the original\", and criticised the lack of split-screen multiplayer. Another critical reviewer was from \"Edge\"; he described the game as \"virtually indistinguishable\" from the first \"Ridge Racer\", and commented that \"Ridge Racer Revolution\" does not fulfil the expectations evoked by the original. It was also stated that it is simply a \"jazzed-up\" \"Ridge Racer 2\", and the visuals were criticised as \"antiquated\". Despite these criticisms, the handling was praised, and the gameplay was described as \"varied\". A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" contended that the original \"Ridge Racer\" was rushed in order to make it out for the PlayStation launch, and that whereas rival Sega had done an exceptional job of fixing their own launch day rush job with \"Virtua Fighter Remix\", \"Namco has simply released a disc with a new track, using the same flawed game engine\". He particularly felt that the price was much too high for what was essentially an expansion pack, and concluded that anyone who bought the game would be \"a half-step away from being conned\". Will Groves of the \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\" described the game as \"a poor sequel\", but liked the range of options provided. He described the game itself as \"great\", but further criticised it for not being fun, as he thought the feel is aggressive.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2146589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146589", "title": "Gorongosa National Park", "text": "Gorongosa National Park\n\nGorongosa National Park is at the southern end of the Great African Rift Valley in the heart of central Mozambique, Southeast Africa. The over park includes the valley floor and parts of surrounding plateaus. Rivers originating on nearby Mount Gorongosa () water the plain.\n\nSeasonal flooding and waterlogging of the valley, which is composed of a mosaic of different soil types, creates a variety of distinct ecosystems. Grasslands are dotted with patches of acacia trees, savannah, dry forest on sands and seasonally rain-filled pans and termite hill thickets. The plateaus contain miombo and montane forests and a spectacular rain forest at the base of a series of limestone gorges.\n\nThis combination of unique features at one time supported some of the densest wildlife populations in all of Africa, including charismatic carnivores, herbivores and over 500 bird species. But large mammal numbers were reduced by as much as 95% and ecosystems stressed during Mozambique's long civil conflict at the end of the 20th century.\n\nThe Carr Foundation/Gorongosa Restoration Project, a U.S. non-profit organization, has teamed with the Government of Mozambique to protect and restore the ecosystem of Gorongosa National Park and to develop an ecotourism industry to benefit local communities.\n\nThe first official act to protect the Gorongosa region, Portuguese Mozambique, came in 1920, when the Mozambique Company ordered 1,000 square km set aside as a hunting reserve for company administrators and their guests. Chartered by the government of Portugal, the Mozambique Company controlled all of central Mozambique between 1891 and 1940.\n\nIn 1935, Mr. Jose Henriques Coimbra was named warden and Jose Ferreira became the reserve's first guide. That same year the Mozambique Company enlarged the reserve to 3,200 square km to protect habitat for nyala and black rhino, both highly prized hunting trophies. By 1940 the reserve had become so popular that a new headquarters and tourist camp was built on the floodplain near the Mussicadzi River. Unfortunately, it had to be abandoned two years later due to heavy flooding in the rainy season. Lions then occupied the abandoned building and it became a popular tourist attraction for many years, known as Casa dos Leões (Lion House).\n\nAfter the Mozambique Company's charter ended, management of the reserve was transferred to the colonial government. Alfredo Rodriques was appointed Warden, replacing Jose Coimbra. Over the next 14 years Rodrigues initiated the first steps towards banning hunting and establishing a viable tourism business. In 1951 construction began on a new headquarters and other facilities at Chitengo camp, including a restaurant and bar. By the end of the 1950s more than 6,000 tourists were visiting annually and the colonial government had awarded the first tourism concession in the park. In 1955 the Veterinary and Animal Industry Services division of the colonial government assumed control of all wildlife management in Mozambique, including Gorongosa. Gorongosa was named a national park by the Government of Portugal in 1960.\n\nMany improvements to the new park's trails, roads and buildings ensued. Between 1963 and 1965 Chitengo camp was expanded to accommodate 100 overnight guests. By the late 1960s it had two swimming pools, a bar and nightclub, a restaurant serving 300-400 meals a day, a post office, a petrol station, a first-aid clinic, and a shop selling local handicrafts.\n\nThe late 1960s also saw the first comprehensive scientific studies of the Park, led by Armando Rosinha, Director of Gorongosa, and Kenneth Tinley, an Australian ecologist. In the first-ever aerial survey, Tinley and his team counted about 200 lions, 2,200 elephants, 14,000 African buffalo, 5,500 wildebeest, 3,000 zebras, 3,500 waterbuck, 2,000 impala, 3,500 hippos, and herds of eland, sable and hartebeest numbering more than five hundred. The great development of Gorongosa until 1975 was made by Armando Rosinha.\n\nTinley also discovered that many people and most of the wildlife living in and around the park depended on one river, the Vundudzi, which originated on the slopes of nearby Mount Gorongosa. Because the mountain was outside the park's boundaries, Tinley proposed expanding them to include it as a key element in a \"Greater Gorongosa Ecosystem\" of about 8,200 square kilometers. He and other scientists and conservationists had been disappointed in 1966 when the government reduced the park's area to 3,770 square kilometers.\n\nMeanwhile, Mozambique was in the midst of a war for independence launched in 1964 by the Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo). Fortunately the war had little impact on Gorongosa National Park until 1972, when a Portuguese company and members of the Provincial Volunteer Organization were stationed there to protect it. Even then, not much damage occurred, although some soldiers hunted illegally. In 1974, the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon overthrew the Estado Novo regime. When the new Portuguese authorities decided to abdicate power in their overseas territories, Mozambique became an independent republic. In 1976, a year after Mozambique won its independence from Portugal, aerial surveys of the Park and adjacent Zambezi River delta counted thousands of elephants in the region and a healthy population of lions, numbering in the hundreds. It was the largest lion population recorded in the greater Gorongosa region to date.\n\nIn 1977, the People's Republic of Mozambique, under the leadership of Samora Machel declared itself a Marxist-Leninist state. A rebel army known as RENAMO sprung up to oppose the new government. Threatened by FRELIMO's new one-party government in Mozambique, neighbouring Rhodesia and South Africa began arming and supplying RENAMO. Once Rhodesia became Zimbabwe in 1980, direct support for RENAMO came from South Africa with the intention of destabilizing Machel's government. Initially dismissed by Machel as a group of \"armed bandits\", RENAMO's war developed into a full-scale national threat by 1981. In December 1981 the Mozambican National Resistance (MNR, or RENAMO) fighters attacked the Chitengo campsite and kidnapped several staff, including two foreign scientists. The Mozambican Civil War lasted from 1977 to 1992.\n\nThe violence increased in and around the Park after that. In 1983 the park was shut down and abandoned. For the next nine years Gorongosa was the scene of frequent battles between opposing forces. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting and aerial bombing destroyed buildings and roads. The park's large mammals suffered huge losses. Both sides in the conflict slaughtered hundreds of elephants for their ivory, selling it to buy arms and supplies. Hungry soldiers shot many more thousands of zebras, wildebeest, African buffalo, and other ungulates. Lions and other large predators were gunned down for sport or died of starvation when their prey disappeared.\n\nA cease-fire agreement ended the civil war in 1992 but widespread hunting in the park continued for at least two more years. By that time many large mammal populations—including elephants, hippos, buffalo, zebras, and lions had been reduced by 95 percent. Surveys counted just 15 buffalo, 5 zebra, 6 lions, 100 hippos, 300 elephants and just a handful of wildebeest. The cheetahs, leopards, hyenas, wild dogs and rhinoceros were nearly extinct. However, the park's extensive birdlife emerged relatively unscathed.\nA preliminary effort to rebuild Gorongosa National Park's infrastructure and restore its wildlife began in 1994 when the African Development Bank (ADB) started work on a rehabilitation plan with assistance from the European Union and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fifty new staff were hired, most of them former soldiers. Baldeu Chande and Roberto Zolho, both employed by the Park before the Civil War, returned to take leadership positions. Chande was director of the emergency program and Zolho was wildlife coordinator and warden. Over a five-year period this ADB initiative reopened about 100 kilometers of roads and trails and trained guards to slow illegal hunting.\n\nIn 2004 the Government of Mozambique and the US-based Carr Foundation agreed to work together to rebuild the park's infrastructure, restore its wildlife populations and spur local economic development—opening an important new chapter in the park's history.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2007 the Carr Foundation invested more than $10 million in this effort. During that time the restoration project team completed a wildlife sanctuary and reintroduced African buffalo and wildebeest to the ecosystem. They also began the reconstruction of Chitengo Safari Camp.\n\nDue to the success of this initial three-year project, the Government of Mozambique and the Carr Foundation announced in 2008 that they had signed a 20-year agreement to restore and co-manage the park. Several thousand visitors now enter the park each year, most staying overnight at Chitengo Safari Camp. Some of these visitors go to see the progress being made in the restoration project, and many others are seeing the park for the first time.\n\nIn July 2010, the Government of Mozambique made public the decision to increase the area of the Gorongosa National Park and to incorporate Mount Gorongosa (above 700 m) making true an old desire that had been presented in the 60s by the then Park ecologist, Kenneth Tinley. The Government also announced the official establishment of a Park buffer zone of 3,300 square km.\n\nSince the beginning of the project, aerial surveys of wildlife have shown sharp increases in the number of large animals.\n\nIn the aftermath of Cyclone Idai, park rangers conducted rescue missions using their helicopter, boat, and tractor. According to Gorongosa Project president Gregory Carr, the park was \"right in the middle of the impacted area.\" Roughly half the park was flooded due to the cyclone, but impacts to wildlife were expected to be minimal as the animals would be able to migrate to higher ground. The protection of this area was cited as a reason that the impacts of the flood on the human population were less severe, as the protected wilderness area can moderate the flow of water.\n\nIn March 2018, a leopard was captured by camera after 14 years.\n\nThe Park is in a 4,000-square-km section of the Great African Rift Valley system. The Rift extends from Ethiopia to central Mozambique. Massive tectonic shifts began forming the Rift about 30 million years ago. Other warpings, uplifts, and sinkings of the Earth's crust over millennia shaped the plateaus on both sides and the mountain to the west. Mozambique's tropical savanna climate, with an annual cycle of wet and dry seasons, has added another factor to the complex equation: constant change in soil moisture that varies with elevation. The valley is located 21 km west of Mount Gorongosa at 14 m above sea level.\n\nGorongosa National Park protects a vast ecosystem defined and shaped by the rivers that flow into Lake Urema. The Nhandungue crosses the Barue Plateau on its way down to the valley. The Nhandue and Mucombeze come from the north. Mount Gorongosa contributes the Vunduzi. Several smaller rivers pour down off the Cheringoma Plateau. Together they comprise the Urema Catchment, an area of about 7,850 square km.\n\nLake Urema is located in the middle of the valley, about three-quarters of the way down from the Park's northern boundary. The Muaredzi River, flowing from the Cheringoma Plateau, deposits sediments near the outlet of the lake slowing its drainage. This \"plug\" causes the Urema River to greatly expand in the rainy season. Water that makes its way past this alluvial fan flows down the Urema River to the Pungue and into the Indian Ocean. In the flooded rainy season, water backs up into the valley and out onto the plains, covering as much as 200 square km in many years. During some dry seasons, the lake's waters shrink to as little as 10 square km. This constant expansion and retraction of the floodplains, amidst a patchwork of savanna, woodland, and thickets, creates a complex mosaic of smaller ecosystems that support a greater abundance and diversity of wildlife than anywhere else in the park.\n\nScientists have identified three main vegetation types supporting the Gorongosa ecosystem’s wealth of wildlife. Seventy-six percent is savanna — combinations of grasses and woody species that favour well-drained soils. Fourteen percent is woodlands — several kinds of forest and thickets. The rest is grasslands subjected to harsh seasonal conditions that prevent trees from growing. All three types are found throughout the system, with many different sub-types and varieties. Tree cover increased throughout the park in the decades following the Mozambican Civil War, likely due to the dramatic declines of large herbivores such as elephants during that period.\n\nMount Gorongosa has rainforests, montane grasslands, riverine forests along its rivers, and forests and savanna woodlands at lower elevations. Both plateaus are covered with a kind of closed-canopy savanna, widespread in southern Africa, called “miombo,” after the Swahili word for the dominant tree, a member of the genus \"Brachystegia\". About 20 percent of the valley’s grasslands are flooded much of the year.\n\nMore than 2,000 people live on Mount Gorongosa. In July 2010 the government of Mozambique and the Gorongosa Restoration Project (headed by the U.S.–based Carr Foundation) announced that Gorongosa Mountain would be added to the park bringing its total size to 4067 km. This designation has contributed to an ongoing conflict between long-term residents of the mountain and representatives of the park.\n\nGorongosa is home to a large diversity of animals and plants—some of which are found nowhere else in the world. This rich biodiversity creates a complex world where animals, plants and people interact. From the smallest insects to the largest mammals, each plays an important role in the Gorongosa ecosystem. The park includes termite mounds used as shade by bushbuck and kudu.\n\nMany of the park's large herbivore populations were greatly reduced by years of war and poaching. However, almost all naturally occurring species—including more than 400 kinds of birds and a wide variety of reptiles—have survived. With effective management and reintroductions of key species, wildlife populations will regain their natural numbers and help restore the park's ecological balance.\n\nIn 2018, 14 African wild dogs from South Africa were reintroduced to Gorongosa National Park. The wild dogs had become extirpated from the park during the 1977-1992 civil war.\n\n"}

Vehicles use one of two styles of powersliding depending on the make of car they select: Drift and Grip. Drift cars require players to tap the brake once while turning to break into a smooth powerslide while Grip cars requires players to alternate between brakes and gas while turning to powerslide.\n\nVehicles are earned by playing through the game's Grand Prix mode. Players select one of four teams; R.C Micro Mouse Mappy (France), Pac Racing Club (Japan), Racing Team Solvalou (Italy), and Dig Racing Team (United States), who each have varying difficulties, and one of four manufacturers; Age Solo (France), Lizard (United States), Assoluto (Italy), and Terrazi (Japan), which determines the style of car and powerslide type the player will use. In each race, the player must attempt to reach a qualifying position, with later stages requiring players to place in higher positions to qualify. Depending on the qualifying position in each race, players will be awarded a new vehicle, or an upgrade to their current one, based on their team and manufacturer, with better cars earned for reaching consistently higher positions (i.e. the best cars are earned by placing 1st in each match while the least impressive cars are earned by just clearing the minimum qualifying positions). There are a total of 320 vehicles earned by racing with every combination of team, manufacturer and qualifying position. If the players unlock all 320 cars, they will unlock an additional one modelled after Pac-Man, for a total of 321 vehicles.\n\nThe game also features Time Attack mode, in which players can attempt to get the fastest time on each course, and VS. Battle, a split-screen mode for two players (the first to appear in the home console series) and an undocumented PlayStation Link Cable mode, allowing four players to play simultaneously. Players can also create their own car decors and participate in Extra Trials against powerful prototype cars. The game is also compatible with the JogCon peripheral and the PocketStation device, which allows players to trade cars with friends.\n\nA peripheral, the JogCon, was released alongside the game, packaged in special editions. The device features a steering wheel type device in the middle of the controller to provide accurate control.\n\n\"R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 Direct Audio\" is the soundtrack to the game, released in 1999 by Namco. It was the second game soundtrack to be released in the \"Ridge Racer\" series and was composed in 1998 by the Namco Sound Team (Kohta Takahashi, Hiroshi Okubo, Asuka Sakai, Tetsukazu Nakanishi, and Koji Nakagawa). The new team was a change from the usual rave music theme that were supplied by Namco's old sound team, Sampling Masters, who worked on the first three installments: \"Ridge Racer\", \"Ridge Racer 2\", and \"Rave Racer\", although Okubo had previously worked on \"Ridge Racer Revolution\" and with Nakanishi on \"Rage Racer\". \"R4\" instead explored music styles encompassing funk, breakbeat, acid jazz, UK garage, progressive house, and neo-soul mixed with traditional Namco-styled synth melodies.\n\nThe track \"Ridge Racer (One More Win)\" features American singer Kimara Lovelace.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"when it comes to the crunch, there's no doubt that \"R4\" is the best arcade-style racer yet seen on PSX: it's fast, fun, and highly addictive.\"\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. \n\nJeff Gerstmann of \"GameSpot\" awarding it 8.7/10, saying \"If you've ever cared about any of the games in the Ridge Racer series, then R4 is definitely the racing game for you\".\n\nIt was a commercial success in Japan, the UK, and the United States.\n\n"}

He rages at the gullibility of humanity for believing such a hoax. He vows to never fall for such odd stories. Just then, a strange-looking creature made of a keg and wine bottles appears. The creature announces in a heavy accent that he is the Angel of the Odd — and that he is responsible for causing such strange events.\n\nThe man, unconvinced, drives the angel away and takes an alcohol-induced nap. Instead of a 20-minute nap, he wakes up two hours later, having missed an appointment to renew his fire insurance. Ironically, his house has caught fire and his only escape is out a window using a ladder the crowd below has provided for him. As he steps down, a hog brushes against the ladder, causing the narrator to fall and fracture his arm.\n\nLater, the narrator's attempts at wooing a rich woman to be his wife end in failure when she realizes he is wearing a wig which he must wear since the fire in his apartment singed off his hair. Then, he tries to woo another woman who also leaves him, scoffing at him for ignoring her as she passes. In reality, a particle had gotten into his eye, momentarily blinding him, just as she passed.\n\nFinally, the narrator decides his ill fortune is cause for him to end his life. He decides to commit suicide by drowning himself in a river after removing his clothes (\"for there is no reason why we cannot die as we were born\", he says). However, a crow runs off with \"the most indispensable portion\" of his clothes and the man chases after it. As he is running, he runs off a cliff. However, he grabs on to the long rope of a hot air balloon as it happens to be floating by. The Angel of the Odd reappears to him and makes him admit that the bizarre really can happen. The narrator agrees, but is unable to physically perform the pledge that the Angel of the Odd demands because of his fractured arm. The Angel then cuts the rope and the man falls down onto his newly-rebuilt house through the chimney and into the dining room. The man then realizes this was his punishment. \"Thus revenged himself the Angel of the Odd.\"\n\nThe introductory paragraph of the story alludes (by last name only) to several authors, particularly Glover and Wilkie. The story also refers to \"Curiosities of Literature\" by Rufus Wilmot Griswold and \"Isabel, or Sicily, a Pilgrimage\" by Henry Theodore Tuckerman.\n\nThe story is especially interesting as it was published only six months after Poe's own great hoax, \"The Balloon-Hoax\", which many believed to be true despite its elements of the odd.\n\nThe angel speaks with an unusual dialect, which Poe biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn said \"was not spoken anywhere on the globe\".\n\n\"The Angel of the Odd\" was first published in \"Columbian Magazine\" in October 1844. Its original full title was \"The Angel of the Odd: An Extravaganza\".\n\n"}

Around the beginning of its development, Taito released a conversion of their arcade game \"RayStorm\" for the PlayStation, whose 3D visuals caught the eye of several video game developers and lead to the release of several 3D shooting games for the console. Being rather impressed with its fast-paced action and polygonal graphics, Irem began to create a new \"R-Type\" game that could potentially rival the success of Taito's game. Lead by director Hiroya Kita, \"Delta\" was the team's first attempt at a 3D video game, which in early test versions proved problematic as many of their ideas were ineffective in 3D compared to the 2D gameplay that Irem had primarily focused on. Designer Koichi Kita recalls the 3D perspective being difficult to work with, notably with its level terrain as it made it difficult to determine the player's hitbox and often lead to the unintended destruction of their ship. Kita also claims the Force pod was a frustrating ordeal as the polygonal visuals made it look \"fake\" and unappealing.\n\nThe idea for multiple playable ships was one of the team's most requested features, as they felt it would add replayability. Originally the player had two different ships to choose from, with a third being added later on to make it more \"satisfying\" and worthwhile. The goal of the playable ships idea was for each of them to be distinctively different from one another without disrupting the core \"R-Type\" gameplay, to make it feel like the player was playing an entirely new game with each ship. The R-9 from the original \"R-Type\" was chosen at the very start, followed by an updated version named the R-X. The R-13 ship was made to appeal towards more \"hardcore\", skilled players, with the \"13\" added to make it feel more sinister, due to the number's connection with superstition. The \"blue\" weapon for the R-X was revised several times as the team was unable to decide on what kind of lasers the ships' tentacle-laced Force could shoot. Stage designs were first created with the R-9 in mind, then later altered slightly to accommodate for the two new ships.\n\nKita came up with the name \"R-Type Delta\" based on the fact three different ships were playable, which reminded him of the Greek symbol delta. Early planning documents for the game referred to it as \"R-Type EVE\", a titled named after the novel \"Parasite Eve\" and met with a mixture of confusion from the production team. Other members suggested titling it simply \"R-Type\" or \"R-Type IV\", which they argued would make the game unrecognizable had it not had either of those names. Kita created a questionnaire sheet with several possible names and sent it to other Irem employees, with \"Delta\" receiving the most votes. He also said the symbol represented the number 4, which alluded to it being the fourth mainline \"R-Type\" game. Towards the end of development, programmer Takayasu Itou added in the series' traditional \"Kid's Mode\" and \"Human Mode\" difficulties, with Kid's being the easiest and Human the hardest. The difficulty itself was made much harder than previous \"R-Type\" games as the team wanted the player to memorize stage patterns and learn from their mistakes, which they claimed made the game much more worthwhile to play.\n\n\"R-Type Delta\" received positive reviews from critics, who generally praised its addictive gameplay and detailed graphics. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" reviewer Che Chou described the game as \"the best \"R-Type\" [title] ever\", while Peter Bartholow of GameSpot commented, \"If there's one PlayStation shooter to own, \"R-Type Delta\" is that shooter.\" The game's graphics were highlighted for their diversity, colors, details, and complex polygon models, with GameSpot noting that each enemy offers unique explosions and attacks. The publication also praised the \"top-notch\" and dynamic soundtrack for giving the game \"a catchy fusion of rock and techno that changes with the game's surroundings.\"\n\nAlthough the gameplay was praised for being both hard and rewarding, some reviewers found it unnecessarily difficult and frustrating. GameSpot highlighted the game's different ships, stating that each offers a strategic use of their weapons and abilities. \"Edge\", however, noted the lack of innovation, concluding: \"\"Delta\"s central gameplay remains a product of the '80s. Your performance upon entering a new level depends largely on trial and error, and the game is as much a test of memory as it is joypad dexterity. As such, it's refreshing and frustrating at the same time [...] A fine shoot 'em up.\"\n\nTom Russo reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"Overall, a fantastic looking effort, but proof that the gameplay limits of this genre will soon relegate all 2D shooters to classic collections.\"\n"}
{"id": "2146622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146622", "title": "R-Types", "text": "R-Types\n\nKazumi Kujo, the chief producer for the series, suggested \"R-Types\" to Irem executives whilst in talks of a potential new \"R-Type\" game. Having fallen into heavy financial difficulties and being weary of the current console game market, Irem proposed that Kujo and staff create a collection of early \"R-Type\" games as a way to test the market if a sequel was suitable. Both games were reprogrammed from scratch via reverse-engineering the original hardware, as opposed to using software emulation. \"R-Types\" allowed Irem to familiarize themselves with the hardware of the PlayStation console.\n\n\"R-Types\" sold well, and gave Irem hope in a new \"R-Type\" game returning a profit. The game was praised by critics for its quality and extra content, although some argued that it could have benefited from additional games and that the difficulty of the two games could turn off potential players. It was re-released as a budget title in 2003, and as a digital download for the PlayStation Network in 2006.\n\n\"R-Types\" includes conversions of the arcade game \"R-Type\" (1987) and its direct sequel \"R-Type II\" (1989). In both games, the player controls a starship named the R-9 that must eradicate the Bydo, a powerful extraterrestrial race bent on the destruction of mankind. Gameplay involves shooting down enemies and avoiding collision with enemies, projectiles and obstacles. The R-9 can perform a charge shot by holding down the fire button, which when release will disperse a powerful blast that cuts through enemies. Destroying small \"POW Armor\" enemies will cause them to leave behind a power-up item, which will grant the player with one of several unique abilities when collected. The most notable of these is the \"Force\", an orange-colored pod that acts as a shield for the R-9 as well as being able to provide additional firepower. The Force can be attached to either the front or back of the R-9, and can also be launched forwards or backwards to fly freely. \"R-Type II\" adds a number of additional features and mechanics, including new weapon types and a new type of charge shot that creates a barrage of shots that home in on enemies.\n\nAlongside the ports of the first two games, \"R-Types\" includes several pieces of bonus content. The most notable of these is the \"R Museum\", an extensive gallery features models and information ships, characters, enemies and locations spanning the history of the \"R-Type\" series up to that point, as well as a history of the series and promotional artwork. A demo for the then-upcoming \"R-Type Delta\" can be played, which ends upon completion of the second level. Two FMV cutscenes can be unlocked by getting a certain score in \"R-Type\" and \"R-Type II\". High-scores are saved to a PlayStation memory card. Controls for the \"Delta\" demo and the arcade ports can be modified to the player's liking.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Japanese video game company Irem, known for several early arcade hits such as \"R-Type\" and \"Moon Patrol\", were suffering greatly from financial difficulties, attributed to a severe lack of major money-making hits compared to their golden years. Shortly after the release of \"\" for the SNES, Irem closed all of its video game production lines in 1994 to focus on restructuring itself and becoming more stable.\n\nAfter the company emerged as Irem Software Engineering in 1997, \"R-Type\" series chief producer Kazumi Kujo proposed a new R-Type game to executives. In an interview with \"Retro Gamer\" magazine, Kujo remembers Irem executives being very hesitant towards the idea, saying they felt the shoot’em up genre was a niche market. After several discussions, Irem proposed that Kujo and other employees create a compilation of early \"R-Type\" games as a way to test the market and see if a new sequel would be profitable. Kujo agreed, and got to work on what later became \"R-Types\". As opposed to using software emulation like other classic game compilations used, Irem instead reprogrammed both of the included games from scratch via reverse-engineering the original arcade boards. \"R-Types\" allowed Irem programmers to familiarize themselves with the internals of the PlayStation console, which became useful for later projects.\n\n\"R-Types\" was completed by early 1998, and was released in Japan on February 5. As a way to create bonds with international publishers, and to rake in additional much-needed profit, Irem worked with European publisher Virgin Interactive and the American branch of the Japanese ASCII Corporation to bring \"R-Types\" overseas. Virgin released the game in Europe in October 1998, while ASCII America released it in North America a year later in March 1999.\n\nOn October 21, 2001, Irem re-released \"R-Types\" in Japan as a budget title, published under the \"R's Best\" brand alongside \"R-Type Delta\". \"R-Types\" was digitally re-released for the PlayStation Network service on December 21, 2006 in Japan, later released on April 24, 2008 in Europe and North America; due to Sony's license with Irem expiring, this version of the game is no longer available for purchase.\n\nAccording to Kujo, \"R-Types\" sold well and gave Irem hope in a new \"R-Type\" sequel performing well financially in the market. Original copies have greatly risen in price over the years, and is seen as a collector's piece among \"R-Type\" fans.\n\nThe game received mostly positive reviews. \"Computer + Video Games\" said \"Although we've had some great shooting games recently, \"R-Types\" still stands out as one of the very best on the PlayStation.\" The quality of the collection itself has been mixed, with some saying it could have benefited from additional titles. \"GameSpot\" said that Irem should have included additional games to make the price point justified, such as \"Super R-Type\" and \"R-Type Leo\", which \"Famitsu\" agreed with. \"Official US PlayStation Magazine\" thought the game had a nice selection of bonus features, as did \"PSX Magazine\". \"GameSpot\" said the presentation was good, but felt outside the CG movies it was rather basic.\n\nThe included games, \"R-Type\" and \"R-Type II\", were liked by several. Many applauded the conversions for being arcade-perfect, and the best ways to play them. \"Official US PlayStation Magazine\" said their quality was the standout among the collection, saying that ports as well-done as these made it one of the best classic game collections released for the system. \"IGN\", \"GameSpot\" and \"PSX Magazine\" all stated that the games were fun to play and had an addictive quality to them - \"GameSpot\" in particular wrote that they offered plenty of gameplay time. Most publications agreed that the game's grand difficulty could put off players. \"GameSpot\" said: \"For gamers less enamored of the past, you'll definitely want to rent before you buy.\" \"CVG\" said that both games were just as fun as they were back in their heyday, saying it made for one of the best classic game collections released. They wrote: \"While it's easy to write off classic game compilations as a waste of time and money, the good ones give you the chance to play the very best examples of video gaming excellence. \"R-Types\" is one of these.\"\n\nIn 2007, \"IGN\" re-reviewed \"R-Types\" for its \"Retro Roundup\" segment of articles, describing it as \"a perfectly cool pairing of some very classic shooters\". They liked the collection for its graphics, precise controls and spot-on emulation quality, saying that it makes for one of the best PSone Classic releases yet. \"IGN\" also said that both \"R-Type\" and \"R-Type II\" hold up very well, making it a great recommendation for fans of the genre.\n\n"}

It is the only town on the coast mentioned in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax between Taenarus and Gythium. The Periplus speaks of its port; but, according to Pausanias, the town itself was distant 10 stadia from the sea, and 40 stadia from Gythium. In the time of Pausanias (2nd century) the town lay in a hollow between the three mountains, Asia, Ilium, and Cnacadium; but the old town stood on the summit of Mt. Asia. The name of Las signified the rock on which it originally stood. It is mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships in the \"Iliad\", and is said to have been destroyed by the Dioscuri, who hence derived the surname of Lapersae. There was also a mountain in Laconia called Lapersa.\n\nIn ancient times Las was a Spartan possession and in 218 BC the citizens of the city fought and routed a part of Philip V of Macedon's army. Las became part of the Union of Free Laconians in 195 BC when it separated from Sparta. The Spartans however recaptured the city in 189 BC. Sparta was then taken over by the Achaean League and Las gained its independence again. When the Romans took over most of Greece in 146 BC, Las and the other Free Laconian cities continued to be recognized as free cities. In Roman times, Las had a bath and a gymnasium.\n\nIn the later period it was a place of no importance. Livy speaks of it as \"vicus maritimus\", and Pausanias mentions the ruins of the city on Mt. Asia. Before the walls he saw a statue of Heracles, and a trophy erected over the Macedonians who were a part of Philip V of Macedon's army when he invaded Laconia; and among the ruins he noticed a statue of Athena Asia. The modern town was near a fountain called Galaco (Γαλακώ), from the milky colour of its water, and near it was a gymnasium, in which stood an ancient statue of Hermes. Besides the ruins of the old town on Mt. Asia, there were also buildings on the two other mountains mentioned above: on Mt. Ilium stood a temple of Dionysus, and on the summit a temple of Asclepius; and on Mt. Cnacadium a temple of Apollo Carneius. Las is spoken of by Polybius and Strabo under the name of Asine; and hence it has been supposed that some of the fugitives from Asine in Argolis may have settled at Las, and given their name to the town.\n\nThe site is not mentioned in Byzantine times until after the Frankish conquest of the Peloponnese, when Mani was given to John of Nully, who built a castle at Las sometime after 1218. This castle became known as Passavant or Passavas in Greek, a name probably related to the motto or war-cry \"Passe-Avant\", \"move forward\", or to one of the similar toponyms in northeastern France. Nully's Barony of Passavant comprised four knight's fiefs, but virtually nothing is known about it. It was apparently short-lived, with the castle itself falling to the Byzantines during their first offensives in the Peloponnese in ca. 1263. \n\nThe castle was in use once again during the second Byzantine domination. The castle of Passavas was occupied by the Ottomans for a short time when they took over the majority of the Peloponnese, in a failed attempt to keep control over the Maniots who refused to accept Ottoman rule. In 1601, a Spanish fleet led by Alonso de Contreras that was raiding in the area surprised the Ottoman garrison and sacked the city. It was regarrisoned in 1669, by the Ottoman general Kuesy Ali Pasha. The castle was captured again in 1684 by the Venetians and the Maniots. The Venetians carried off the cannons and destroyed the city so it would not be used again. When the leader of the Maniots was executed by the Ottomans, his mother led the men of Skoutari who dressed up as priests on Easter Sunday and were allowed entry to the castle. When they got in they took out their hidden weapons and not many of the 700 families inhabiting the castle escaped. The castle was abandoned after that and has not been inhabited since.\n\nLas stood upon the hill of Passavas (), which is now crowned by the ruins of a fortress of the middle ages, among which, however, William Martin Leake, who visited the site in the 19th century, noticed, at the southern end of the eastern wall, a piece of Hellenic wall, about 50 paces in length, and two-thirds of the height of the modern wall. It is formed of polygonal blocks of stone, some four feet long and three broad. The fountain Galaco is the stream Turkóvrysa, which rises between the hill of Passavas and the village of Kárvela, the latter being one mile and a half (2.5 km) west of Passavas.\n\nThe present castle on the site dates after the 13th century, perhaps even after the Middle Ages. It is of a quadrilateral shape, some 180 m long and 90 m wide. The castle originally featured large round towers on the northwestern, southeastern, and southwestern corners, but only the northwestern one survives. A square tower was located on the northeastern corner, the highest point of the castle; two other square towers were located in the middle of the northern and eastern walls. The wall surrounding the castle was not very tall—the \"chemin de ronde\" is barely 2 m higher than the castle's interior—and its north-eastern side is particularly feeble, as it was protected by its location on the top of the rocky hill. The entrance was probably in the south. Unidentified structures were built adjoining the walls on the interior, while during the later Ottoman occupation a mosque was built in the centre.\n\n"}

By extension, the term \"art song\" is used to refer to the collective genre of such songs (e.g., the \"art song repertoire\"). An art song is most often a musical setting of an independent poem or text, \"intended for the concert repertory\" \"as part of a recital or other relatively formal social occasion\". While many pieces of vocal music are easily recognized as art songs, others are more difficult to categorize. For example, a wordless vocalise written by a classical composer is sometimes considered an art song and sometimes not.\n\nOther factors help define art songs:\n\nArt songs have been composed in many languages, and are known by several names. The German tradition of art song composition is perhaps the most prominent one; it is known as \"Lieder\". In France, the term \"mélodie\" distinguishes art songs from other French vocal pieces referred to as chansons. The Spanish canción and the Italian canzone refer to songs generally and not specifically to art songs.\n\nThe composer's musical language and interpretation of the text often dictate the formal design of an art song. If all of the poem's verses are sung to the same music, the song is strophic. Arrangements of folk songs are often strophic, and \"there are exceptional cases in which the musical repetition provides dramatic irony for the changing text, or where an almost hypnotic monotony is desired.\" Several of the songs in Schubert's \"Die schöne Müllerin\" are good examples of this. If the vocal melody remains the same but the accompaniment changes under it for each verse, the piece is called a \"modified strophic\" song. In contrast, songs in which \"each section of the text receives fresh music\" are called through-composed. Most through-composed works have some repetition of musical material in them. Many art songs use some version of the ABA form (also known as \"song form\" or \"ternary form\"), with a beginning musical section, a contrasting middle section, and a return to the first section's music. In some cases, in the return to the first section's music, the composer may make minor changes.\n\nPerformance of art songs in recital requires special skills for both the singer and pianist. The degree of intimacy \"seldom equaled in other kinds of music\" requires that the two performers \"communicate to the audience the most subtle and evanescent emotions as expressed in the poem and music.\" The two performers must agree on all aspects of the performance to create a unified partnership, making art song performance one of the \"most sensitive type(s) of collaboration\". As well, the pianist must be able to closely match the mood and character expressed by the singer. Even though classical vocalists generally embark on successful performing careers as soloists by seeking out opera engagements, a number of today's most prominent singers have built their careers primarily by singing art songs, including Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Thomas Quasthoff, Ian Bostridge, Matthias Goerne, Wolfgang Holzmair, Susan Graham and Elly Ameling. Pianists, too, have specialized in playing art songs with great singers. Gerald Moore, Geoffrey Parsons, Graham Johnson, Dalton Baldwin, Hartmut Höll and Martin Katz are six such pianists who have specialized in accompanying art song performances. The piano parts in art songs can be so complex that the piano part is not really a subordinate accompaniment part; the pianist in challenging art songs is more of an equal partner with the solo singer. As such, some pianists who specialize in performing art song recitals with singers refer to themselves as \"collaborative pianists\", rather than as accompanists.\n\n\n\n19th century:\n20th century:\n\nIn Spanish:\nIn Portuguese (all Brazilian):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the second game in the main \"Spyro\" series following \"Spyro the Dragon\", and like its predecessor, received critical acclaim. A remastered version of the game was released as part of the \"Spyro Reignited Trilogy\" in 2018.\n\nPlayers control Spyro the Dragon as he fights against various enemies and obstacles using his flame breath, charge attack, and glide abilities. His health is indicated by the color of his dragonfly partner, Sparx, who can replenish his health by eating butterflies. Bottled butterflies will both completely restore Sparx's health and give Spyro an extra life. The game is split up into three main hub worlds containing portals to various realms. In order to progress through the first two hub worlds, the player must acquire a talisman from each realm, which is awarded for reaching the end of the level, before facing the boss of each world. Each level also contains a certain number of orbs, which can be earned by completing secondary tasks for particular NPCs, such as lighting a series of lamps or protecting characters from attacks. These orbs are required for opening some of the portals to certain levels, as well as progressing through the third hub world. Gems gathered throughout the game are required to pay fees Moneybags charges in order to progress through the game. As well as opening portals or granting access to certain areas, Moneybags also teaches Spyro three brand new abilities over the course of the game. Swimming lets Spyro dive underwater to reach submerged treasure and hidden tunnels, climbing lets Spyro climb up certain surfaces, and the headbash lets Spyro perform an overhead smashing attack which can break rocks and certain cages. In addition, each level has a power-up gate, activated after defeating a specific number of enemies in a level, which grants Spyro a temporary super-ability. The power-up can grant invulnerability or the abilities to fly, supercharge, super flame, breathe ice, or super jump to reach high up areas.\n\nThe only characters from the original game to return as main characters in this game are Spyro, the game's protagonist, and Sparx, his dragonfly sidekick. Sparx functions as the player's health meter, and assists the player in gathering gems. This game introduces new characters into the Spyro series, many of whom would appear in later games. Both Hunter and Moneybags make recurring appearances in the series, while Ripto would make more series appearances than any other antagonist, making him the key villain of the original series. The dragons of the previous installment have been replaced with an entirely new cast of characters, including fauns, satyrs, anthropomorphic animals, and robotic businessmen, among others.\n\nThe world of Avalar is divided into three realms: the Summer Forest, the Autumn Plains, and the Winter Tundra. In every realm, there is a castle that, during the course of the storyline, is captured by Ripto. Each realm features a number of different worlds, a speedway world, and a dungeon in which Ripto or his minions are hiding.\n\nSpyro the Dragon and his dragonfly partner Sparx, have enough with the continuous raining in Artisans and wondering when the sun will come out, they decide to take a vacation to Dragon Shores. Upon going through the portal, however, Spyro ends up in the fantasy realm of Avalar, having been summoned there by Elora the Faun, Hunter the Cheetah, and the Professor. They explain that whilst experimenting with a large portal device, they inadvertently summoned an iron-fisted angry warlock known as Ripto, along with his minions Crush and Gulp. Pleased to find himself in a world without dragons whom he views as pests, Ripto decided to conquer Avalar, prompting Elora and the others to summon a dragon to fight against him. Currently stranded in Avalar as a result of Ripto destroying the portal he came in through, Spyro agrees to help fight against him, gathering up talismans from the various realms of Avalar in order to confront and defeat Crush and Gulp. Ripto then manages to steal a power crystal, which was used to power the large portal device, which he uses to create a new scepter for himself (which Gulp had eaten the original scepter in the intro by mistake), but Spyro manages to defeat him as well. With peace returned to Avalar, Elora and the others fix the portal device, allowing Spyro to take his long-awaited vacation to Dragon Shores.\n\nThe game's epilogue, which is unlocked by completing the Skill Points list in the Guidebook, reveals what happened to various friends and enemies that Spyro encountered in Avalar, such as Spyro and Elora missing their chance to kiss, Crush being taught by the Professor how to spell, and a list of dummied enemies that didn't make it into the game. In the end, Spyro returns to the Dragon Realm, with Hunter joining him, setting the stage for the .\n\nThe sequel to \"Spyro the Dragon\" was tentatively titled \"Spyro the Dragon 2\" during its pre-production phase. The music for \"Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!\" was composed by Stewart Copeland and was engineered and co-produced by Jeff Seitz. The character Spyro is voiced by Tom Kenny, replacing Carlos Alazraqui from the first game, while additional voices are provided by Kenny, Gregg Berger, Melissa Disney, Milton James, Mary Linda Phillips and Marcelo Tubert. The game's sound effects were created by Mike Gollum, Harry Woolway and Ron Horwitz of Universal Sound Studios. The game was officially announced at 1999 E3 convention in Los Angeles, CA; it was later released in North America on November 2, 1999. Sony Computer Entertainment of America director of product development Ami Blaire stated, \"Spyro 2 isn't just another sequel. Players will surely be lured by Spyro's playful antics, but they'll experience gameplay that's more challenging and more fun then ever before.\"\n\nThe game became available for download on the European PlayStation Network on July 26, 2007, before its predecessor was released to the same market. Less than a week later, however, it was removed because the Colossus and Idol Springs levels failed to load. On April 17, 2008, it was released on the Japanese PlayStation Store. On May 7, 2009, a corrected version of the game became available for download from the North American PlayStation Store and was re-released on the European PlayStation Store on December 12, 2012. \"Spyro 2\", alongside its prequel and , received a remastered release with updated visuals on November 13, 2018 as part of the \"Spyro Reignited Trilogy\" compilation for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. This compilation retains the game's North American name, Ripto's Rage!, as opposed to the title used for the original European and Australian release, Gateway to Glimmer.\n\nChris Kramer reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"\"Spyro 2\" feels like a kids' title, but it has more meat to it than the first, and the cute graphics may make your girlfriend finally stop cooing over those damn Pokémon.\"\n\n\"Ripto's Rage\" received critical acclaim. With a score of 87% at GameRankings, based on an aggregate of 15 reviews. GameSpot's Joe Fielder gave the game an 8.6/10, saying that it \"injected a dose of soul and variety into a game that was already pretty fun to play\". IGN's Doug Perry gave it an 8.8/10, stating that it \"is a fun, and excellent platformer\".\n\n\"Ripto's Rage!\" received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n"}

The glass keys are made of either hard glass (plate glass) or soft glass (stained glass). The keys are resonated with either a single open top box or individual resonators for each key. Mallets used to play the marimba can be constructed using a compressed silicone ball (bouncy ball) attached to one end of a wooden or synthetic dowell. These mallets bring out the purest sound from glass marimba. Other types of mallets are used for different effects. The tuning system of a glass marimba can be whatever is desired. Glass marimbas are utilised by the Brazilian percussion ensemble, Uakti.\n\nGlass marimba can be constructed in a variety of ways.\nHow one resonates the keys governs the construction method and design.\nResonation can be accomplished using a single resonator which all the keys resonate into, such as an open top box, or individual resonators for each key which can be a tube, box, or sphere. Single box resonators can be constructed from wood, glass, or metal among a variety of materials. Individual resonators can be made from gourds, wood, bamboo, clay, glass, pvc, or metal, to name a few.\nThe keys also govern the design of the marimba due to the fact that the keys are supported at points called nodes and these dictate the shape of the marimba due to the graduated lengths of the keys and how one supports them. Also, the width of the keys, which can be graduated, determines the overall length.\n\nKeys can be made from plate glass or stained glass. \nWith stained glass, two pieces must be fused together in a kiln to obtain the necessary thickness of 1/4\" for the most common glass marimba tunings, though thinner and thicker keys can be used for low and high tunings. Tuning is accomplished most commonly by removing glass from the end of the key which causes the note to go up. Removing glass from the bottom of the key will cause the note to go down but is only feasible if one is using opaque glass for the keys.\n\nThe keys are best supported on a pad of open cell foam mounted to a thin piece of wood and encased in cloth.\n\nThe keys are attached with double sided clear tape. Silicone glue is also used.\n\nAn alternate method of attachment is to use posts between each key on one side and a single post going through a hole in the key on the other side. \n"}
{"id": "2146652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146652", "title": "Spyro: Year of the Dragon", "text": "Spyro: Year of the Dragon\n\nSpyro: Year of the Dragon is a 2000 platform game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. \"Year of the Dragon\" is the third installment in the \"Spyro\" series. The game was the last \"Spyro\" game Insomniac developed; their next title would be \"Ratchet & Clank\" for the PlayStation 2. It was released in North America and for PAL regions in October and November 2000, respectively, but unlike the other two games, it was not given a Japanese release.\n\nNamed after the animal of the Chinese zodiac, which was the symbol at the time of the game's release, \"Year of the Dragon\" follows the titular purple dragon Spyro as he travels to the \"Forgotten Worlds\" after 150 magical dragon eggs are stolen from the land of the dragons by an evil sorceress. Players travel across thirty different worlds gathering gems and eggs. \"Year of the Dragon\" introduced new characters and minigames to the series, as well as offering improved graphics and music.\n\nUpon release, the game sold more than two million units in the United States and received critical acclaim. Reviewers noted the game built on the successful formula of its predecessors by adding new activities and expansive environments. \"Year of the Dragon\" was followed by the multiplatform title \"\", and was later re-released under the Greatest Hits label, and remastered as part of the \"Spyro Reignited Trilogy\" in 2018.\n\n\"Year of the Dragon\" is portrayed primarily in the third person; its gameplay makes few deviations from that of its predecessors. The main objective of the game is to collect special dragon eggs which are scattered across 37 worlds. These eggs are hidden, or are given as rewards for completing certain tasks and levels. The worlds of \"Spyro\" are linked together by \"homeworlds\" or \"hubs\", large worlds which contain gateways to many other levels. To proceed to the next hub, the character must complete five worlds, gather a certain number of eggs, and defeat a boss. Players do not need to gather every egg to complete the main portion of the game or gain access to new levels; in fact, certain eggs can only be found by returning to the world at a later time. Gems are scattered across the worlds, hidden in crates and jars. These gems are used to bribe a bear named Moneybags to release captured \"critters\" and activate things which help Spyro progress through levels (Such as bridges). Gems, along with the number of eggs collected, count to the total completion percentage of the game.\n\nThe player controls the dragon Spyro for most of the game. Spyro's health is measured by his companion Sparx, a dragonfly who changes color and then disappears after taking progressively more damage. If the player does not have Sparx, then the next hit would cause the player to lose a life and restart at the last saved checkpoint. Consuming small wildlife known as \"fodder\" regenerates Sparx. Spyro has several abilities, including breathing fire, swimming and diving, gliding, and headbutting, which he can use to explore and combat a variety of enemies, most of which are rhinoceros-like creatures called Rhynocs. Some foes are only vulnerable to certain moves. Spyro can run into \"Powerup Gates\", which give him special abilities for a limited period.\n\n\"Year of the Dragon\" introduced playable characters other than Spyro, known as \"critters\", which are gradually unlocked as the player proceeds through the game. Critters can be found blocking the level they are played in until released from Moneybags. Subsequently, the player plays as the character in specially marked sections of levels. Each homeworld features one world which is played through entirely by a non-Spyro character. There are a total of seven playable characters, which all have their own special moves and abilities. Sheila the Kangaroo, for example, can double jump, while Sgt. Byrd is armed with rocket launchers and can fly indefinitely.\n\nBesides the primary quest to find dragon eggs, \"Year of the Dragon\" features an extensive set of minigames, which are split off from the levels into smaller zones. Some of the minigames were featured in \"\" and were subsequently expanded for \"Year of the Dragon\", while others are entirely new to the series. These minigames are played by Spyro or the other playable characters.\n\nThe game's protagonist Spyro the Dragon is assisted by additional characters throughout \"Year of the Dragon\". Sparx, Spyro's dragonfly sidekick, functions as the player's health meter and assists the player in gathering gems; Sparx is also a playable character in certain levels. Also aiding Spyro is Hunter the Cheetah, who teaches the player game mechanics and is a playable character at special racing levels. Four other playable characters are freed during the game; Sheila the kangaroo, Sgt. Byrd the penguin, Bentley the yeti, and Agent 9 the monkey. The main enemy is the Sorceress, the iron-fisted mean and bad-tempered queen of the Forgotten Worlds. Aiding her is Bianca the Rabbit, her apprentice who attempts to hinder Spyro on his mission, with almost no success.\n\nThe game opens with a celebration in the land of the dragons, where Spyro and his kin are celebrating the \"Year of the Dragon\", an event that occurs every twelve years when new dragon eggs are brought to the realm. During the celebration however, Bianca invades the Dragon Realms with an army of rhino-based creatures called Rhynocs and steals all of the Dragon eggs, bringing them back to the Sorceress, who spreads the eggs throughout several worlds. The worlds are split up into four home realms: Sunrise Spring, Midday Garden, Evening Lake, and Midnight Mountain. Spyro, Sparx, and Hunter are sent down a hole to find the thieves and recover the dragon eggs.\n\nWhile pursuing the thief, Spyro discovers a world once inhabited by the dragons, but long abandoned and forgotten. This world is under the iron-fisted reign of the Sorceress and her Rhynoc army. Spyro meets with Shiela the Kangaroo, Sergeant Byrd the Penguin, Bentley the Yeti, and Agent 9 the Monkey who help him on his quest. Shiela in particular tells how when the dragons left the realm, the world's magic began to dry up. Spyro travels through each world in the forgotten realm, acquiring aid from the local inhabitants and rescuing the dragon eggs. It is revealed that the Sorceress not only actually banished the dragons originally without realising they were the source of her kingdom's magic, but is seeking not the baby dragons themselves, but merely their wings to concoct a spell that can grant her immortality. Once Bianca learns about this, she turns against the Sorceress and decides to help Spyro defeat her. Spyro fights and defeats the Sorceress, but she survives the battle and waits for him, even though the game is considered \"beat\" at this point as evidented with the subsequent rolling credits. After he defeats her again and retrieves the last dragon egg, Spyro returns all of the baby dragons to the Dragon Realms. Along the journey to help Spyro recover the eggs, Hunter forms a crush on Bianca, and after Spyro's first battle with the Sorceress, they both start a love relationship, with Spyro and Sparx looking on in dismay.\nDevelopment of \"Spyro: Year of the Dragon\" spanned about ten and a half months, from November 1999 to September 2000; the development team was influenced by a host of other games, including \"Doom\" and \"Crash Bandicoot\". Among the new features touted before the game's release was \"Auto Challenge Tuning\", which Insomniac CEO Ted Price described as \"invented to even out the gameplay difficulty curve for players of different abilities\". The levels were made much larger than those in \"Spyro 2\", so that more areas for minigames could be added; to prevent player confusion on where to go next, these areas were designed to load separately from the main hubs. Price stated that the addition of critters was a way to make the game more enjoyable and varied, instead of just adding more moves for Spyro. The game was named \"Year of the Dragon\" simply because it was released during 2000, the year of the Dragon in the Chinese zodiac.\n\nIn previews, publications such as IGN and GameSpot noted that the graphics had been improved, and that there were many new characters and locations. The new minigames were previewed, and IGN pointed out that they offered enough complexity to back up the simple gameplay. In an interview with GameSpot, Ted Price stated that the emphasis for the title was on the new critters, but that Spyro would not be left behind in the story. \"Year of the Dragon\" also implemented crack protection, in addition to the copy protection previous games had contained. This helped prevent hackers from cracking the game until two months after release.\n\nDespite the positive response the game would go on to receive, \"Year of the Dragon\" was developer Insomniac Games' last \"Spyro\" title. In an interview, CEO Ted Price said that the company stopped producing the games because they could not do anything new with the character, and that after five years of development on a single series, the team wanted to do something different. Future \"Spyro\" games were produced by, among other developers, Digital Eclipse, Equinox Digital Entertainment, Eurocom, Krome Studios, Étranges Libellules, Tantalus Media, Vicarious Visions, and Toys for Bob.\n\nThe music for \"Year of the Dragon\" was composed and produced by Stewart Copeland, former drummer for the rock band The Police, with additional contributions by Ryan Beveridge. During the band's hiatus, Copeland composed several movie soundtracks, and composed the scores for the previous \"Spyro\" titles; Price stated that Copeland's offering for the third installment was his best work to date. In an interview, Copeland stated that his creative process for writing the music for the \"Spyro\" series always began by playing through the levels, trying to get a feel for each world's \"atmosphere\". Copeland noted the challenge of writing for games was to create music that would both be interesting to listen to and complemented the gameplay; his approach was to incorporate more complicated harmonies and basslines so that the music could seem fresh for players, even after repeated listening. He complimented the compact disc format of the PlayStation and its support for high quality audio; there were no technical constraints that stopped him from producing the sound he wanted. Copeland recorded entire orchestral scores for extra flourish when the visuals called for an expansive sound, but used more percussive and beat-driven melodies for \"high-energy\" moments in the game.\n\n\"Year of the Dragon\" was first released on October 24, 2000. It was critically acclaimed, with the game receiving an average score of 91/100 based on 15 reviews on Metacritic. According to GameRankings, \"Year of the Dragon\" is the 19th highest rated PlayStation game of all time. The game sold more than two million units in the United States. It received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. \"Year of the Dragon\" was remastered along with the first two \"Spyro\" games in the \"Spyro Reignited Trilogy\".\n\nGameSpot noted that while \"Year of the Dragon\" made no significant changes to the formula of its predecessors, the combination of new playable characters, more detailed graphics, and the wide variety of minigames made the game worth buying. IGN praised the game's appeal to all ages and the polished levels, as well as the successful multi-character focus. \"GamePro\" noted that the ability of the game to automatically drop the difficulty if players get stuck was an excellent feature. \"Next Generation Magazine\"s Kevin Rice provided one of the most positive reviews in which he stated the top-notch level design, intuitive controls and excellent graphics made the title the best \"Spyro\" game to date, and arguably the best PlayStation game overall. Publications like PSXExtreme thought the music helped bring atmosphere to the varied worlds, and Allgame enthused that \"Insomniac should be commended for realizing the importance of music in games; it seems to enhance the whole experience.\" Other points of praise were the voice acting and character development. \n\nSome reviewers critiqued that the camera could be annoying at times, particularly when it was unable to keep up with Spyro. Joseph Parazen of Game Revolution found the sound to be well done but nothing extraordinary, arguing that the background music and sound effects were both fairly generic, while the voice acting was better than usual. He also called the game's premise its only real flaw, as it was too unoriginal, but added that \"the story that unfolds as you actually play the game is flawlessly interwoven and quite entertaining\". Other publications cautioned that elements of the game might feel too much like those of its predecessors.\n"}

It is the third game in the \"Syphon Filter\" series.\n\nSecretary of State Vince Hadden brings in Gabriel Logan, Lian Xing, and Lawrence Mujari to testify in Congress about their relationship to the Agency. He believes all three to be guilty, and questions them after they assassinate Shi-Hao from a hotel in Japan. The three do not realize that Hadden is involved in the conspiracy, and is looking for scapegoats.\n\nGabe begins by describing the first Syphon Filter investigation. He and Lian went to Costa Rica to find missing Agent Ellis. When they arrive, the two see that Erich Rhoemer has ordered Ellis killed, but Gabe must continue his mission and identify what Rhoemer was doing at the drug plantation. Gabe chases Rhoemer onto an airplane despite his Agency superior Edward Benton denying him permission. Gabe did not know back then that Benton and the Agency controlled Rhoemer, who escaped from the plane.\n\nMujari testifies next, and tells Hadden how he once worked for a resistance during the Apartheid era in South Africa. At the Pugari Gold Mine, he discovered that mining slaves had caught a deadly plague and the mine owners were covering it up. Mujari retrieved samples and gave them to Teresa Lipan.\n\nWhen it's Lian's turn to testify, she details her first encounter with Gabe during the Soviet–Afghan War and her role in the Costa Rica operation. Meanwhile, Gabe goes to Ireland with MI-6 agent Maggie Powers in an effort to scuttle a shipment of Syphon Filter, denying possession to the consortium and the local IRA cell. On board the S.S. Lorelei, Gabe plants several explosives and finds a document that will point to a virus test site in Australia. He also looks for any information on the mysterious arms consortium that controls the Agency. Gabe uncovers a mole in MI-6, Nigel Cummings, who is aiding them. He kills Nigel and secures the last viral transport on the docks. The Lorelei is sunk with all hands.\n\nBack in Washington, D.C., Gabe talks about his first meeting with Benton during the Soviet-Afghan conflict. Benton claimed to be a CIA agent transporting weapons to Afghans rebelling against the Soviets, but when Gabe and Ellis escort the convoy, the Afghans attack them. Gabe gets into Kabul and meets Lian, who sets up the diversion. However, a tank gets in their way, so Gabe destroys it. He learns that Benton was supplying arms to the Soviets, and was really an Agency operative.\n\nAs Hadden questions Gabe, Lian teams up with Maggie to abduct Dr. Elsa Weissenger from the Australian test site. Elsa is ready to betray the conspirators since Aramov left her behind, and she has Lian assemble a vaccine for aborigines held captive by Commander Silvers. Silvers plans to kill the test subjects, so Lian kills him first. When she returns to Elsa, Lian finds her gone.\n\nHadden accuses Gabe of lying and corruption. He believes Gabe murdered Teresa, but Teresa surprises him by appearing herself. Agency operative Jason Chance had only injured her, not killed. She describes her first meeting with Gabe during her time as an officer with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. A group of NSA agents headed by Colonel Silvers were posing as FBI to eradicate a private militia that had recovered data from a government satellite. Gabe, as an Agency operative, saved her life, and helped her when she rescued the wife and son of the militia leader. She left the ATF and joined the Agency.\n\nTeresa faked her death to find the people behind the Agency. Her investigations into Aramov yielded a connection to Hadden himself. Before Gabe can apprehend him, Mara kills Hadden. She and several consortium terrorists take over the Senate building, but Gabe prevents her from detonating any explosives. He chases her onto a train full of hostages, and wounds her.\n\nIn a post-credits cutscene, Mara escapes despite being incarcerated. Gabe decides to find her, but for now the Syphon Filter crisis appears to be over with the death of Hadden. Gabe will become the new Agency director, and free it from corruption. Little does he know that an operation is ongoing near the S.S. Lorelei's wreck site. People are recovering the viral crates, and Mara is heard laughing, setting the stage for .\n\nThe game was originally slated for release on 25 September 2001. However, the fallout of the September 11 attacks forced Sony to postpone the release while modifying the marketing campaign. The game was released on 6 November. The game's original cover had Gabe and Lian in action inside a courtroom that had a U.S. flag in the background amidst a swirl of gas. The anthrax scare following the attacks resulted in the cover being changed to a simple one showing Gabe and Lian's faces, while the header line \"United States Federal Bureau of Investigation\" on the back cover was changed to \"Agency Mission Briefing\".\n\nTommy Layton reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"Graphically solid, slickly presented, and sporting a solid selection of mission types in a complex storyline, \"Syphon Filter 3\" is perhaps the last great PSX action title.\"\n\n\"Syphon Filter 3\" received mixed reviews. It received a score of 74.64% on GameRankings based on 28 reviews and 73/100 on Metacritic based on 19 reviews.\n\n"}

His siblings were the poet Oliver Bernard, and the photographer Bruce Bernard. He was a paternal cousin to the actor Stanley Holloway.\n\nBernard attended Pangbourne College for two years before his parents responded to the college's protest that he was \"psychologically unsuitable for public school life\".\n\nEven while at school, Bernard had begun to explore Soho and Fitzrovia with his brother Bruce. Seduced by the area's lurid glamour, he moved there at 16, supporting himself in a variety of jobs that were at odds with his middle-class background, including boxing booth attendant, building labourer, kitchen assistant and coal miner, but still managed to build a circle that embraced Dylan Thomas, Francis Bacon, John Minton, Nina Hamnett, Daniel Farson and the lowlife of bohemian London.\n\nIn his youth Bernard was considered extremely good-looking and supplemented his earnings with gifts and loans from wealthy older women. Some acquaintances suggested he did the same with older men but Bernard always vehemently denied this. Elizabeth Smart suggested that he try journalism and he started to write about his interest in horseracing in \"Queen\" magazine.\n\nBernard continued to submit writing to various papers. He became Racing Correspondent for satirical magazine \"Private Eye\", and even had work accepted by ex-employer \"Sporting Life\". He was given a column in \"The Spectator\" in 1975. His column, entitled \"Low Life\" was contrasted with the \"High Life\" column by wealthy socialite Taki Theodoracopulos, writing as \"Taki\". While Taki's column described a life of yachts, casinos, and grand hotels, Bernard's was described by Jonathan Meades as a \"suicide note in weekly instalments\" and principally chronicled his daily round of intoxication and dissipation in the Coach and Horses public house and its fateful consequences. This was mixed with anecdotes, many of which were repeated in the play \"Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell\", and ponderings on life. His lifestyle had an inevitable effect on his health and reliability, and the magazine often had to post the notice \"Jeffrey Bernard is unwell\" in place of his column.\n\nThough married four times (Anna Grice in 1952, Jackie Heard, Jill Wilsworth and Sue Gluck), he often remarked, only half in jest, that alcohol was \"the other woman\". Over time his drinking affected his health more seriously; he was hospitalised for detoxification, he suffered from pancreatitis and then diabetes. His right leg was amputated, three years before his death. Instead of the regular notice, \"The Spectator\" announced, \"Jeffrey Bernard has had his leg off\". He died at his home in Soho at age 65 of renal failure after refusing further treatment by dialysis.\n\n"}
{"id": "2146672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146672", "title": "Millbrae station", "text": "Millbrae station\n\nMillbrae station is an intermodal transit station serving Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Caltrain, located in Millbrae, California. The station is the terminal station for BART on the San Francisco Peninsula, served by two lines: The SFO–Millbrae line at all times and the Richmond–Daly City/Millbrae line on weekdays before 9 pm. It is served by all Caltrain service except for a small number of limited-stop trains. The station is also served by SamTrans bus service, Alliance and Caltrain shuttle buses, and other shuttles.\n\nRail service to the area began with 17 Mile House station, which opened in 1864 on land deeded by Darius Ogden Mills; it was renamed Millbrae the next year. The station was rebuilt in 1890 and 1907 after twice burning down. The 1907-built station was threatened with demolition in 1976, but was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. A modern intermodal terminal opened in 2002, connecting BART and Caltrain for the first time. The older station building was restored for use as a railway museum, which opened in 2004.\n\nMillbrae station has five tracks and three platforms at ground level, with a fare concourse on a mezzanine level above. The Caltrain tracks are on the west side of the station. The westernmost (southbound) track has a side platform; the northbound track uses half of an island platform shared with BART. South of the Millbrae Avenue bridge, the northbound track splits in two to form a triple-track section to allow passing trains. The northbound platform extends past the BART area as a side platform, and curves to serve the diverging track.\n\nBART has three tracks; the western track serves the east side of the northbound Caltrain platform (with faregates between the two systems), allowing a cross-platform connection between northbound service. The other two tracks serve an island platform. Because ridership at Millbrae is lower than expected, only the western track is used in regular service; the other two tracks are used for train storage.\n\nA 2,200-space parking garage (with direct access to the mezzanine), busway, and surface parking lots are located on the east side of the station. A smaller busway and parking lot for Caltrain are on the west side.\n\nThe BART platform at Millbrae has six sculptures partially embedded in concrete blocks, with each figure representing a different era in community history. Forty-two terrazzo benches installed at the station show scenes of local nature and history.\n\nIn 1862, after buying a section of Rancho Buri Buri from José de la Cruz Sánchez, Darius Ogden Mills deeded land to the under-construction San Francisco and San Jose Railroad in exchange for a station to allow guests to visit his estate. The line opened in October 1863; the adobe 17 Mile House station opened in 1864 and was renamed Millbrae the next year. The line was soon taken over by the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) for its Peninsula Commute service. The station burned in 1890.\n\nThe station burned again in 1906 and was replaced with a two-story colonnade-style depot of standard SP design the next year. It was located on the west side of the tracks just south of Millbrae Avenue. In 1976, preparing to discontinue the money-losing Peninsula Commute (which instead became publicly funded as Caltrain), the SP proposed to tear down the station. However, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Southern Pacific Depot on September 1, 1978 after efforts by the newly formed Millbrae Historical Society. In August 1980, the building was moved south to make room for a widening of Millbrae Avenue.\n\nAs part of the BART SFO Extension, a new intermodal terminal for BART, Caltrain, and Samtrans was built in Millbrae just north of Millbrae Avenue. BART service to the $70 million facility began on June 22, 2003. The station was initially served by the Pittsburg/Bay Point line, plus a shuttle service to San Francisco International Airport station (SFIA). The shuttle service was discontinued on February 9, 2004. The Richmond line began serving Millbrae at weekday peak hours, with the Pittsburg/Bay Point line providing service at other times.\n\nBART service to stations in San Mateo County is funded by SamTrans, rather than county tax revenues. As ridership stayed below expectations, SamTrans had to pay a larger-than-planned operating subsidy to BART. On September 12, 2005, in order to lower these subsidies, BART reduced service so that only the Dublin/Pleasanton line served SFIA and Millbrae stations. SamTrans and BART reached an agreement in February 2007 in which SamTrans would transfer control and financial responsibility of the SFO/Millbrae extension to BART, in return for BART receiving additional fixed funding from SamTrans and other sources.\n\nOn January 1, 2008, BART increased service to the San Mateo stations. Service to Millbrae station was provided by the Richmond line on weekdays, and the Dublin/Pleasanton line on weeknights and weekends. Direct service between SFIA and Millbrae was discontinued. On September 14, 2009, the Pittsburg/Bay Point line was extended to Millbrae on nights and weekends (with the Dublin/Pleasanton line cut back to Daly City station), restoring direct service at those times. On February 11, 2019, SFO–Millbrae line service resumed on weekdays and Sundays. The station continues to be served by the Richmond line on weekdays, with the Antioch line (formerly the Pittsburg/Bay Point line) serving both SFIA and Millbrae on weeknights and Saturdays. On February 10, 2020, the SFO–Millbrae line begna running during all operating hours, with the Antioch line operating only to SFIA.\n\nMillbrae station was expected to have some 16,500 daily BART boardings by 2017, but has consistently fallen well short of projections, with under 7,000 daily boardings by then. Millbrae is planned to be a California High-Speed Rail station. Senate Bill 1029, passed in 2012, provided funds to lengthen the Caltrain platforms for future high-speed rail trains.\n\nCaltrain no longer needed the historic station building after operations moved to the modern station. The Millbrae Historical Society negotiated with Caltrain to use the building as a museum in exchange for maintaining it. The Millbrae Train Museum opened in October 2004. In 2006, Pullman car \"Civic Center\", built in 1941 for the \"City of San Francisco\", was moved adjacent to the station and opened as an exhibit. The Society plans to acquire a locomotive and construct a section of track to run excursion service.\n\nMillbrae station is served by a number of bus routes and shuttles:\n\nA large busway is located on the east side of the station. It is used by the Burlingame-Bayside Shuttle, Foster City Shuttle, SamTrans routes 397 and 713, the Sierra Point Shuttle, and private shuttles serving Genentech's South San Francisco campus and various airport hotels. A smaller busway adjacent to the southbound Caltrain platform is used by the Burlingame-North Shuttle, Broadway Millbrae Shuttle, and SamTrans route SFO. SamTrans route ECR stops on El Camino Real to the west of the station.\n\n"}

{"id": "2146683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146683", "title": "Tomb Raider Chronicles", "text": "Tomb Raider Chronicles\n\nTomb Raider Chronicles is an action-adventure platform video game developed by Core Design and published in 2000 by Eidos Interactive for PlayStation, Microsoft Windows and Dreamcast. Following \"\", series protagonist Lara Croft is presumed dead, and a group of friends attend a memorial service at her home to recount tales of her earlier exploits. Gameplay follows Lara through linear levels, solving puzzles and fighting enemies. Some levels incorporate additional gameplay elements such as stealth.\n\nDespite the presumed death of Lara Croft in \"The Last Revelation\", Core Design was told by Eidos to continue the series; while a new team worked on \"\" for the PlayStation 2, a veteran team developed \"Chronicles\" based on concepts cut from \"The Last Revelation\". \"Chronicles\" received mixed reviews from critics, being cited as running out of ideas for the series on the original PlayStation engine, and is remembered as one of the weakest \"Tomb Raider\" games, and at 1.5 million copies is one of the worst-selling games in the series.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Tomb Raider Chronicles\" is closely tied to that of \"Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation\". Lara now can walk on a tightrope, grab and swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. Lara sports a new camouflage snow-suit and a black catsuit suitable for infiltration.\n\nThe crossbow and grenade launcher from \"Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation\" have not returned, but the MP5 submachine gun and Desert Eagle from \"Tomb Raider III\" are revived. New equipment consists of a TMX-Timex that Lara uses to track her statistics and grappling gun, which fires a grappling hook into perishable surfaces and produces a rope from which Lara can swing. It is used to latch on certain areas of the ceiling and swing across vaults. Only one vehicle (of sorts) appears: a high-tech diving suit designed to penetrate deep waters. The ability to save wherever one desires returns from \"The Last Revelation\" as does the combining system of puzzle items used to progress in the level. Lara also uses a crowbar and a torch to progress through the virtual world.\n\nSecrets in \"Tomb Raider Chronicles\" are represented by a golden rose (much like the dragons in \"Tomb Raider II\"). In total there are 36 scattered throughout the game and when the player has found every one of them, a new special features menu is unlocked from the Options screen.\n\nFollowing the events of \"\", Lara Croft is presumed dead, buried under the collapsed Great Pyramid of Giza. At Lara's home of Croft Manor, three former friends and associates—Lara's butler Winston, Father Patrick Dunstan and Charles Kane—reminisce over some of Lara's early exploits following a memorial service.\n\nThe first story follows Lara's quest through the catacombs of Rome in search of the Philosopher's stone. She is pursued by Larson Conway and Pierre DuPont, adversaries she would later encounter during the events of \"Tomb Raider\". The second story, recounted by Kane, sees Lara hunting the Spear of Destiny, lost on the ocean floor since World War II. Infiltrating Zapadnaya Litsa, she smuggles herself aboard a Russian Naval submarine commanded by Admiral Yarofev and his Mafia handler Sergei Mikhailov, who also seeks the Spear. Lara recovers the Spear, but she is ambushed by Mikhailov. The Spear's power is unleashed, killing Mikhailov, damaging the submarine and wounding Yarofev. Lara escapes the submarine, but Yarofev remains behind as the Spear destroys the submarine.\n\nThe third story, told by Dunstan, follows a teenage Lara when she secretly follows Dunstan to an island apparently haunted by demonic forces. Lara confronts several apparitions and monsters which inhabit the island, including a horse-riding humanoid demon called Vladimir Kaleta who was trapped in a prison of running water by the island's former monastic community. Dunstan is taken hostage by Kaleta, who forces Lara to block the river imprisoning him. Using a book discovered in the ruined monastery's library, Lara says Kaleta's demon name \"Verdelet\", taking control of him and banishing him from Earth. The fourth story, related by Winston, shows Lara infiltrating the corporate headquarters of her former mentor Werner Von Croy to retrieve the Iris, the pursuit of which first caused the schism between Lara and Von Croy.\n\nTheir stories completed, the three toast Lara. In parallel to these events, Von Croy digs through the rubble of the Great Pyramid in a desperate attempt to find her. He finally discovers Lara's backpack among the ruins of the Great Pyramid but no sign of her body: he declares \"We've found her!\", presuming that Lara is alive.\n\nCore Design, developers of \"Tomb Raider\" since its inception, had grown fatigued of the series after producing three games successively since completing the original game. The team had attempted killing off Lara in \"The Last Revelation\", but Eidos insisted that the series continue. Core Design split into two teams; one new team worked on \"\" for PlayStation 2, while a veteran team developed \"Chronicles\". Most of the team from \"The Last Revelation\" returned to create \"Chronicles\". Designer Andy Sandham, speaking in a 2016 retrospective on the Core Design \"Tomb Raider\" games, called \"Chronicles\" \"a load of old shit\", saying that the staff created the game to earn a living rather than having any passion for it. In a different interview, he called it the hardest \"Tomb Raider\" title he worked on.\n\nEach area was designed around a different gameplay theme; Rome emulated classic \"Tomb Raider\" platforming, Russia was focused on action and stealth elements, Ireland forced players to handle a version of Lara without weapons, and the fourth area brought more stealth elements and new elements such as a companion helping Lara remotely. Several level ideas were originally pitched for \"The Last Revelation\" before Jeremy Heath-Smith, the head of Core Design, insisted that the latter game focus on tomb-based environments. As with \"The Last Revelation\", a separate tutorial area based in Lara's home was removed to reduce the workload. Several gameplay elements were expanded and refined, including new moves including the tightrope walk and refining the inventory UI. For the PC version, Core Design released the level building tools as a level editor on a second disc. This was done as \"Chronicles\" would be the last game using that generation of technology, and they wanted to allow fans the freedom to create levels of their own.\n\n\"Chronicles\" continued the narrative from \"The Last Revelation\", continuing to assume that Lara was dead. Due to this style, the narrative structure broke away from the linear style used in earlier titles in favour of an anthology format, with four separate adventures loosely tied together by framing sequences. Sandham wrote the game's script after the game's level structure was finalised. There were several continuity errors in the Rome segment of \"Chronicles\" related its chronological placement and Pierre's death, attributed by Sandham to not referring to the original game's script beforehand. The use of flashbacks rather than a continuous contemporary narrative allowed Core Design to create very different levels without being tied together with an overarching story. It was also designed to close off the original era of \"Tomb Raider\"—including its technology and storyline—prior to the release of \"The Angel of Darkness\". The Irish levels were included by Sandham, who had a love of Irish folklore and was inspired by the cover art of \"The Black Island\", a book from \"The Adventures of Tintin\".\n\nThe music was composed by Peter Connelly, who returned from \"The Last Revelation\". As with other his other projects, Connelly used early level builds as inspiration for his compositions. Taking inspiration from the narrative's gloomy tone, \"Chronicles\" used a darker musical style while retaining established \"Tomb Raider\" musical motifs. The main theme is very short compared to earlier \"Tomb Raider\" games, but Connelly had wanted something \"epic\". Time constraints meant that \"Chronicles\" did not have a proper main theme, with the closest being an opening segment that was inspired by Connelly's original plans.\n\nIt received mixed reviews from critics, although some reviews for \"Tomb Raider Chronicles\" were highly positive. IGN were primarily mixed, rating it a 6.5/10 and saying \"Lara Croft's last adventure on PlayStation is also her very best. Still, it's just more of the same.\" They went on to add \"If you haven't liked any of the games or got tired of the series after the 2nd, 3rd or 4th games, then there's nothing here in Chronicles that will revitalise your passion for the series or get you to like it for the first time. \"Tomb Raider Chronicles\" is basically more of the same, so you probably know better than anyone else whether or not it's something that you'll like.\n\nGameSpot were mixed, claiming \"The main problem is that the \"Tomb Raider\" series hasn't grown with the times\". They were particularly complimentary of the graphics and said \"Regarding the PlayStation version specifically, the graphics look better than ever before. The environments in the first \"Tomb Raider\" were very sparse and bland, but over the years the developers have been able to squeeze more and more out of the PlayStation. For a game on an aging system, there's a surprising degree of detail in \"Tomb Raider Chronicles\" -without a significant sacrifice of level size.\" One particularly scathing review came from \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", who said \"It should be illegal for you to own money if you even considered buying this crap.\" While, \"GamePro\" awarded the game a score of 3.5/5, echoing the view that \"Tomb Raider\" was somewhat in need of an update, remarking \"Despite the improved graphics and imaginative story, \"Tomb Raider Chronicles\" has the same controls as previous \"Tomb Raider\" games, and they feel as antiquated as any relic Lara ever unearthed.\"\n\nDavid Chen reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"Got 'em all? Go ahead – you'll love it.\"\n\nRetrospective staff opinions of \"Chronicles\" have been mixed, with many staff feeling it was their worst \"Tomb Raider\" project at that time due to a lack of enthusiasm and franchise fatigue. In journalistic retrospectives, \"Chronicles\" has been ranked as the weakest 32-bit entries, and one of the worst \"Tomb Raider\" entries prior to the notoriously poor \"The Angel of Darkness\".\n\nIn their financial report in February 2001, Eidos included \"Chronicles\" among the successful titles published during the late 2000 period. The game has sold 1.5 million copies worldwide; this made \"Chronicles\" the worst-selling \"Tomb Raider\" game up to that point and the second worst-selling main title in the franchise.\n\n"}
{"id": "2146685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146685", "title": "Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation", "text": "Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation\n\nTomb Raider: The Last Revelation is the fourth instalment in the \"Tomb Raider\" video game series. It was developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive. It was released on PlayStation, Microsoft Windows and on the Dreamcast with exclusive graphical and sound enhancements. The game was a commercial success, selling 5 million copies worldwide, and was the last \"Tomb Raider\" game released on Sony PlayStation's \"Greatest Hits\".\n\nThis game features many new moves. Lara can now grab hold of ropes dangling from the ceiling and swing from them. These can be used to cross large gaps. She can climb up and down ropes and poles also. She can now shimmy around corners unlike in previous titles. Lara herself in this instalment has a smoother, more refined appearance. This is due to moving and flexible joints between meshes, creating a more realistic approach to the heroine.\nIn this game, Lara has the ability to return to previous levels, with some levels taking place in a non-linear order. She also has the option of taking different routes through some of the levels, each with their own set of challenges. Instead of the previously used \"item ring\", the inventory screen places the items into a line. There is also a compass in the lower left hand corner of the inventory screen, but it is only important to activate cheats or to help solve a puzzle in the Citadel level. Also, when in the inventory, some items will have the word \"combine\" in its menu. Selecting it will cause a second item line to appear. The player can then select an item to combine with it to form a new item. A new weapon, a large revolver, appears late in the game and is very powerful and effective at stopping enemies. When combined with the laser sight, which lights a red dot at the point where the bullet will strike, the player can use it to shoot specific small targets. The player can also attach the laser sight to a crossbow.\n\nThe story opens in Angkor Wat in 1984, when Lara Croft is 16. She and her mentor, Werner Von Croy, are exploring ancient ruins, searching for an ancient artefact called the Iris. They find it, but Lara finds inscriptions that warn of terrible retribution for any who disturb the artefact. Von Croy ignores the warnings and the temple begins to close. Lara is forced to run, leaving him trapped inside.\n\nIn 1999, Lara and a local guide are searching for the Tomb of Seth, hoping to find the Amulet of Horus, a charm in the shape of an ankh, set with a ruby. Upon removing it from a sarcophagus, she finds that the amulet is the key to sealing the dark god Seth away for eternity. Horus and his ally Semerkhet constructed the sarcophagus to hold Seth and that, by removing the amulet, Seth has been released. Her guide is revealed to be working for Von Croy, who is determined to take the amulet for himself. Lara quickly escapes after being chased by Von Croy's mercenaries.\n\nLara visits an old friend, Jean-Yves, who reveals to her the full magnitude of her mistake. He also reveals that the one place where she might find a way of reversing the damage is in the Tomb of Semerkhet, hidden in the ruins of Karnak. Lara goes there and, after fighting off Von Croy's mercenaries, finds the entrance and opens it with the amulet. Von Croy follows her, steals the amulet and seals Lara inside. After navigating various traps and strange enemies within the tomb, she finds inscriptions put there in case Seth was ever released. It tells of the Armour of Horus, used by the god in his battle with Seth. When an ancient astrological conjunction occurs (called the Millennial Constellation), and the armour, together with the amulet, is placed on Horus's statue within his temple under the Great Pyramid of Giza, the god can be summoned and imprison Seth once again.\n\nAfter escaping a monster in the Tomb (resulting in her guide being killed) and jumping aboard a train, she makes her way to Alexandria, where she once again meets Jean-Yves. He tells her that his excavations around Cleopatra's palaces have been interrupted by strange creatures frightening the workers away. Lara goes through the palaces and gains the armour. On returning to Jean-Yves, she finds that he has been kidnapped by Von Croy, with the price of his release being the armour.\n\nLara travels to a rendezvous in Cairo to find the city in chaos and the sky darkened by strange clouds. After battling her way through the streets, she finds a wounded Egyptian sergeant, who tells her of strange and diabolical creatures who have arisen and are guarding the ancient sites throughout the city. After carrying out several tasks for the sergeant, he drives a truck full of explosives into a massive, dragon-like creature guarding the way to an ancient citadel, giving his life so that Lara can continue. Lara finds Jean-Yves, who reveals that Von Croy has been possessed by Seth and is digging in ancient Crusader vaults for the Ceremonial Tablet, which contains Seth's binding spell. Lara, after traversing the citadel and avoiding resurrected crusader knights, finds Von Croy/Seth in an old tomb opened with the Amulet. Seth offers to \"grant [her] vigour as those around [her] fall\". Lara refuses and runs out of the tomb, pulling the Amulet away, trapping Von Croy/Seth inside.\n\nLara travels to Giza, where the forces of Seth have gathered to block the way to Horus, since the Millennial Constellation is in position. Lara, after fighting her way through those forces and climbing the Great Pyramid, finds her way down into the Temple of Horus and, fitting the armour and amulet to the statue, summons Horus. Horus partially completes his transfer, but Seth arrives and destroys the armour, though the amulet remains undamaged. Lara makes her way out, avoiding Seth's attacks until in the safe light of the constellation. She locks the doors into the temple with the amulet, trapping Seth inside forever. Making her way out, Lara sees Von Croy at the entrance. Unsure about whether he is free of Seth's influence, she is unwilling to take his arm as the temple begins to collapse around her. Von Croy tries to save her as she hangs from a ledge, but is forced to rush out, leaving Lara to her presumed death. Von Croy doffs his hat and lowers his head at the collapsed entrance as the game ends.\n\nDevelopment of the game began in 1998. The game uses an engine that was built specifically for this game due to the fact that a greater emphasis was put on the PC version which they did not want to be held back by the PlayStation version.\n\nWorking on the fourth \"Tomb Raider\" game in as many years, the development team was suffering from creative fatigue, and according to designer Andy Sandham, this was what led to the game ending with Lara Croft's death:\n\nThe development team began by reading books on ancient civilizations, then designed levels based on these, which Sandham then shaped into the plotline.\n\nVoice actress Jonell Elliot replaced Judith Gibbins as the voice of Lara Croft.\n\nThere are two PlayStation versions of the game, with minor differences. The first version requires going back to the title screen after death and only allows five saves per memory card. The second version allows the player to load a saved game immediately after death, and can save a maximum of seven games per official PlayStation memory card. The first version is the one available for download in the PlayStation Store.\n\n\"The Times\", in association with Core, designed a one-off special level to celebrate the finding of Tutankhamen's Tomb. Sir Peter Stothard, a British newspaper editor, is featured as a character briefly in the first scene of this expansion.\n\n\"The Last Revelation\" received generally favourable reviews from critics and was a bestseller for two months in the UK. \"Edge\" considered it the best \"Tomb Raider\" game since the original, stating that \"The Last Revelation\" is more involved than its predecessors because switch- and key-based puzzles were reduced in favour of \"individually programmed mysteries\" such as 20 Squares. IGN also gave the game a positive review, but did state that it \"feels like the gaming equivalent of dusting off old photos and staring at the faded pictures\". But even so, they did point out that \"\"Lara Croft\" is such an incredibly strong franchise by this point that critics could light it on fire in protest, and it would still sell into the millions on console and PC formats\".\n\nIn a mixed review, GameSpot concluded that \"The Last Revelation\" \"is an acceptable game based on its own merits, but, set against its own legacy, it is for all intents and purposes indistinguishable from those that have come before it. It reeks of a ready-to-go game engine and of a level designer going through the motions, with someone else coming up with a new move for Lara all the while\".\n\nStephen Frost reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"If this was the first sequel, we'd be impressed. As it is, we're barely satisfied.\"\n\nJeff Lundrigan reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"It was a borderline game to begin with. Avoid this version like the plague.\"\n\n\"The Last Revelation\"s computer version received a \"Silver\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. ELSPA gave the game's PlayStation release a \"Platinum\" certification, for sales of at least 300,000 copies in the region.\n"}
{"id": "2146686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146686", "title": "Pre-Romanesque art and architecture", "text": "Pre-Romanesque art and architecture\n\nPre-Romanesque art and architecture is the period in European art from either the emergence of the Merovingian kingdom in about 500 CE or from the Carolingian Renaissance in the late 8th century, to the beginning of the 11th century Romanesque period. The term is generally used in English only for architecture and monumental sculpture, but here all the arts of the period are briefly described.\n\nThe primary theme during this period is the introduction and absorption of classical Mediterranean and Early Christian forms with Germanic ones, which fostered innovative new forms. This in turn led to the rise of Romanesque art in the 11th century. In the outline of Medieval art it was preceded by what is commonly called the Migration Period art of the \"barbarian\" peoples: Hiberno-Saxon in the British Isles and predominantly Merovingian on the Continent.\n\nIn most of western Europe, the Roman architectural tradition survived the collapse of the empire. The Merovingians (Franks) continued to build large stone buildings like monastery churches and palaces.\n\nThe unification of the Frankish kingdom under Clovis I (465–511) and his successors, corresponded with the need for the building of churches, and especially monastery churches, as these were now the power-houses of the Merovingian church. Two hundred monasteries existed south of the Loire when St Columbanus, an Irish missionary, arrived in Europe in 585. Only 100 years later, by the end of the 7th century, over 400 flourished in the Merovingian kingdom alone. The building plans often continued the Roman basilica tradition.\n\nMany Merovingian plans have been reconstructed from archaeology. The description in Bishop Gregory of Tours' \"History of the Franks\" of the basilica of Saint-Martin, built at Tours by Saint Perpetuus (bishop 460–490) at the beginning of the period and at the time on the edge of Frankish territory, gives cause to regret the disappearance of this building, one of the most beautiful Merovingian churches, which he says had 120 marble columns, towers at the East end, and several mosaics: \"Saint-Martin displayed the vertical emphasis, and the combination of block-units forming a complex internal space and the correspondingly rich external silhouette, which were to be the hallmarks of the Romanesque\".\n\nThe Merovingian dynasty were replaced by the Carolingian dynasty in 752 CE, which led to Carolingian architecture from 780 to 900, and Ottonian architecture in the Holy Roman Empire from the mid-10th century until the mid-11th century. These successive Frankish dynasties were large contributors to Romanesque architecture.\nMerovingian, Carolingian and Ottonian\n\n\nOttonian and Holy Roman Empire\n\nCarolingian art is the roughly 120-year period from about 780 to 900, during Charlemagne's and his immediate heirs' rule, popularly known as the Carolingian Renaissance. Although brief, it was very influential; northern European kings promoted classical Mediterranean Roman art forms for the first time, while also creating innovative new forms such as naturalistic figure line drawings that would have lasting influence. Carolingian churches generally are basilican, like the Early Christian churches of Rome, and commonly incorporated westworks, which is arguably the precedent for the western facades of later medieval cathedrals. An original westwork survives today at the Abbey of Corvey, built in 885. After a rather chaotic interval following the Carolingian period, the new Ottonian dynasty revived Imperial art from about 950, building on and further developing Carolingian style in Ottonian art.\n\nGermanic pre-Romanesque art during the 120-year period from 936 to 1056 is commonly called Ottonian art after the three Saxon emperors named Otto (Otto I, Otto II, and Otto III) who ruled the Holy Roman Empire from 936 to 1001.\n\nAfter the decline of the Carolingian Empire, the Holy Roman Empire was re-established under the Saxon (Ottonian) dynasty. From this emerged a renewed faith in the idea of Empire and a reformed Church, creating a period of heightened cultural and artistic fervour. It was in this atmosphere that masterpieces were created that fused the traditions from which Ottonian artists derived their inspiration: models of Late Antique, Carolingian, and Byzantine origin.\n\nMuch Ottonian art reflected the dynasty's desire to establish visually a link to the Christian rulers of Late Antiquity, such as Constantine, Theoderich, and Justinian as well as to their Carolingian predecessors, particularly Charlemagne.\n\nOttonian monasteries produced some of the most magnificent medieval illuminated manuscripts. They were a major art form of the time, and monasteries received direct sponsorship from emperors and bishops, having the best in equipment and talent available.\n\nIn the 7th century the Croats, with other Slavs and Avars, came from Northern Europe to the region where they live today. The first Croatian churches were built as royal sanctuaries, and the influence of Roman art was strongest in Dalmatia where urbanization was thickest. Gradually that influence was neglected and certain simplifications and alterations of inherited forms, and even creation of original buildings, appeared.\n\nAll of them (a dozen large ones and hundreds of small ones) were built with roughly cut stone bounded with a thick layer of malter on the outside. Large churches are longitudinal with one or three naves like Church of Holy Salvation () at the spring of the river Cetina, built in the 9th century, along with the Church of Saint Cross in Nin. The largest and most complicated central based church from the 9th century is dedicated to Saint Donatus in Zadar.\n\nAltar rails and windows of those churches were highly decorated with transparent shallow string-like ornament that is called \"pleter\" (meaning to weed) because the strings were threaded and rethreaded through itself. Motifs of those reliefs were taken from Roman art; sometimes figures from the Bible appeared alongside this decoration, like \"relief in Holy Nedjeljica\" in Zadar, and then they were subdued by their pattern. This also happened to engravings in early Croatian script – Glagolitic. Soon, the Glagolitic writings were replaced with Latin on altar rails and architraves of old-Croatian churches.\n\nFrom the \"Crown Church of King Zvonimir\" (so called \"Hollow Church\" in Solin) comes the altar board with \"figure of Croatian King\" on the throne with Carolingian crown, servant by his side and subject bowed to the king.\n\nBy joining the Hungarian crown in the twelfth century, Croatia lost its full independence, but it did not lose its ties with the south and the west, and instead this ensured the beginning of a new era of Central European cultural influence.\n\nAnglo-Saxon art covers the period from the time of King Alfred (885), with the revival of English culture after the end of the Viking raids, to the early 12th century, when Romanesque art became the new movement. Prior to King Alfred there had been the Hiberno-Saxon culture, producing in Insular art the fusion of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic techniques and motifs, which had largely ceased in Ireland and Northern England with the Viking invasions. Anglo-Saxon art is mainly known today through illuminated manuscripts and metalwork.\n\nAfter the demise of the Carolingian Empire, France split into a number of feuding provinces, so that lacking any organized Imperial patronage, French art of the 10th and 11th centuries became localised around the large monasteries, and lacked the sophistication of a court-directed style.\n\nMultiple regional styles developed based on the chance availability of Carolingian manuscripts (as models to draw from), and the availability of itinerant artists. The monastery of Saint Bertin became an important centre under its abbot Odbert (986–1007) who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian forms. The nearby abbey of Saint Vaast created a number of works. In southwestern France at the monastery of Saint Martial in Limoges a number of manuscripts were produced around year 1000, as were produced in Albi, Figeac and Saint-Sever-de-Rustan in Gascony. In Paris there developed a style at the abbey of Saint Germain-des-Prés. In Normandy a new style developed from 975 onward.\n\nThe first form of Pre-Romanesque in Spain and Portugal was the Visigothic art, that brought the horse-shoe arches to the latter Moorish architecture and developed jewellery.\n\nAfter the Moorish occupation, Pre-Romanesque art was first reduced to the Kingdom of Asturias, the only Christian realm in the area at the time which reached high levels of artistic depuration. (See \"Asturian art\"). The Christians who lived in Moorish territory, the Mozarabs, created their own architectural and illumination style, Mozarabic art.\n\nThe best preserved Visigothic monument in Portugal is the Saint Frutuoso Chapel in Braga.\n\nSouthern Italy benefited from the presence and cross-fertilization of the Byzantines, the Arabs, and the Normans, while the north was mostly controlled first by the Carolingians. The Normans in Sicily chose to commission Byzantine workshops to decorate their churches such as Monreale and Cefalù Cathedrals where full iconographic programmes of mosaics have survived. Important frescos and illuminated manuscripts were produced.\n\n \n\n\n"}

After two seasons with Spanish club Tenerife, with whom he reached the UEFA Cup semi-finals in 1997, Andersson joined Göteborg, where he was the club's first choice goalkeeper until the 2008 season. There was some speculation that he would retire after the 2006 season, but Andersson himself stated in the official IFK magazine that he would continue for at least three more seasons.

The official title of \"Twisted Metal: Small Brawl\" was revealed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo on May 16, 2001. The game utilizes a physics engine based on what was used in \"Twisted Metal 2: World Tour\".\n\n\"Twisted Metal: Small Brawl\" received mixed reviews from critics. Trevor Rivers of GameSpot concluded that \"some will immediately be turned away by the graphics and others by the more childish design, but if your PlayStation is still kicking, you might want to check it out.\" \"Play Magazine\" speculated that \"this must be where Martha Stewart's evil siblings reside.\" The Badger of GameZone noted that the graphics felt \"very unfinished\" and the changes included in the game \"[lacked] any real depth\". \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" said that the game \"isn't a bad game by any means, but it feels like a definite step in the wrong direction.\" \"GamePro\" said that the gameplay was \"laboriously slow\" and that \"there's no real sense of speed.\" Mark Fujita of IGN remarked that the game's graphics, sound, gameplay and level design were all worse than previous \"Twisted Metal\" titles, criticizing the graphics as \"appalling\" and the menus as \"horrendous\". Kraig Kujawa of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" cited the \"plumber's ass that sticks out from underneath the sink in the kitchen level\" as the best feature in the game, while Shane Bettenhausen warned that \"series veterans won't be impressed\", and Christian Nutt dismissed the game as \"a slapdash, sloppy and unimaginative retrofit.\" Andy McNamara of \"Game Informer\" remarked that the game \"doesn't even live up to the first four PSX titles in the series.\"\n"}
{"id": "2146697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146697", "title": "Lake Jocassee", "text": "Lake Jocassee\n\nLake Jocassee is a , deep reservoir located in northwest South Carolina created by the state in partnership with Duke Power in 1973. The lake is commonly known for the clean and cold Appalachian mountain rivers that feed the lake to keep its waters cool and clear year-round. The Jocassee Dam, which forms the lake, is high and long. The lake is within Devils Fork State Park.\n\nAlthough most manmade structures were demolished before the creation of the lake, divers recently discovered the remains of a lodge which was left intact until the lake rose; it is now below 300 feet of water. Mount Carmel Baptist Church Cemetery was a setting for a scene in the film \"Deliverance\" (1972), starring Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight, produced before the lake was flooded. The site is now covered by 130 feet of water in the lake.\n\nA confluence of four rivers supplies Lake Jocassee's water. The farthest west of the rivers, the Whitewater River, flows southeast until it meets the northwest corner of Lake Jocassee. The Thompson River flows due south until it too reaches the lake in the northwest corner. The Horsepasture River feeds the lake from the northeast corner, along with the Toxaway River, which is directly east of the Horsepasture River.\n\nThe Jocassee Hydro Station, located in the southeast corner of Lake Jocassee, separates it from the beginning of Lake Keowee, also known as the Keowee River. Lake Keowee's furthest extent to the south brings it close to the city of Seneca, with the old mill town of Newry actually on it. Unlike Lake Jocassee, Keowee is heavily settled, primarily because most of the land adjacent to Lake Jocassee is owned by Duke Power and the State of South Carolina.\n\nA rare wildflower, the Oconee Bell (\"Shortia galacifolia\"), native to only a few counties in the Blue Ridge area, was discovered in the area in 1788 by French botanist André Michaux. The creation of Lake Jocassee is said to have caused the destruction of the heart of the species' range. More recently, biologists have documented the occurrence of a number of rare, threatened and endangered species. The Eastatoee Gorge Heritage Preserve was transferred from Duke Power Company to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources in 1979 due to the extremely diverse flora occurring there.\n\nWildlife management efforts in the Jocassee Gorges area began as early as the 1930s when the Chief Game Warden managed the stocking of trout from the Cleveland State Fish Hatchery, Table Rock State Hatchery, and the Walhalla National Fish Hatchery. This led to the investigation and improvement of fish populations in the area. People hiking, hunting, fishing, or nature watching benefit from the fish stocking and law enforcement of the Game Management Program (now WMA).\n\nThe name Jocassee comes from the legend of a Cherokee maiden. An Oconee tribe, the \"Brown Vipers\" led by Chief Attakulla, inhabited the west side of the Whitewater river, while a rival tribe, \"The Green Birds\", lived on the east. Legend says that a young Green Bird warrior, Nagoochee was not afraid to enter Brown Viper hunting grounds. On one occasion, he fell and broke his leg and was convinced he was going to die. Then he heard Jocassee, Attakulla's daughter, who brought him back to her father's lodge and nursed him back to health. Jocassee eventually fell in love with him, but in a later battle, Cheochee, Jocassee's brother, killed and brought Nagoochee's head back on his belt. Legend has it that Jocassee went into the water and did not sink but walked across the water to meet the ghost of Nagoochee. The name Jocassee means \"Place of the Lost One.\"\n\nThe Jocassee Gorges area was once home to the part of the Cherokee Nation; it now lies beneath the surface of the lake, near the Toxaway River. Nearby Keowee Town was a major hub in the Cherokee Path that connected Cherokee towns and villages throughout the area. Early 18th Century traders delivered as many as 200,000 deerskins annually to Charleston, South Carolina and local Indians became well supplied with European firearms, ammunition, tools and clothing as a result. However, mounting discord between Europeans and Cherokees led to war in 1759. In 1785, General Andrew Pickens hosted a large gathering of Indian chiefs leading to a treaty that gave all of the Jocassee gorges area, with the exception of northern Oconee County, to the United States; the Oconee mountains were not ceded until 1815. European settlers, mostly of Scottish and Irish descent, came from Virginia and Pennsylvania as well as from Charleston. Land grants in the Jocassee area go back to 1791.\n\nLake Jocassee was one of the filming locations for the 2012 movie \"The Hunger Games\".\n\nLake Jocassee holds state records for 5 species of fish, including three in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae). In 2001 a Redeye bass and a Smallmouth bass were caught. An Spotted bass was caught in 1996. The last two came from the salmon family (Salmonidae). A Brown trout was caught in 1987 and an Rainbow trout was caught in 1993.\n\nThe Jocassee Hydro Station, owned by Duke Power, in between Lake Jocassee and Lake Keowee, is a 610 megawatt pumped storage facility. Also, just off the Whitewater River, Bad Creek Hydroelectric Station is a 1,065 megawatt pumped-storage facility that started generating electricity in 1991 and is also owned by Duke Power. Both facilities provide jobs for the surrounding area.\n\n\n\n"}

The Maniots fought against a combined Egyptian and Ottoman army under the command of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt.\n\nOn March 17, 1821, the Maniots (residents of the central peninsula on the southern part of the Peloponnese) declared war on the Ottoman Empire, preceding the rest of Greece in joining the revolution by about a week. The various Greek forces won a quick string of victories. However, disputes broke out amongst the leaders and anarchy ensued. The Ottomans seized this chance and called for reinforcements from Egypt. The reinforcements came under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, the son of the leader of Egypt, Muhammad Ali. With the Greeks in disarray, Ibrahim ravaged the Peloponnese and after a four months siege he captured the city of Missolonghi in April. He then went back to the Peloponnese and turned his attention in June to Mani.\n\nIbrahim tried to enter Mani from the north-east near Almiro on June 21, 1826, but he was forced to stop at the fortifications at Vergas. His army of 7,000 men was held off by an army of 2,000 Maniots and 500 refugees from other parts of Greece. Despite Egyptian and Ottoman artillery, the outnumbered Maniots managed to hold off the Ottomans. Ibrahim sent 1,500 men to attempt a landing near Areopolis and go north to threaten the Maniot rear. This force was initially successful; however they were repelled with heavy losses. When the Egyptians at Vergas heard that Theodoros Kolokotronis was advancing on their rear they retreated.\n\nIn August, Ibrahim renewed the offensive and he sent a group of regular soldiers down the coast and they reached Kariopoli before they retreated. Ibrahim sent a force of 8,000 men down to Polytsaravo and on the way they destroyed a tower that was opposing them. When they reached Polytsaravo, they were faced by the Maniots in their forts. The Egyptians and the Ottomans were forced to retreat with significant losses. This was the last time Mani was invaded during the War for Independence, as Greece was liberated in 1828.\n\nThe Greek War of Independence had started on the March 17, 1821, when the Maniots declared war on the Ottoman Empire at Areopoli. On March 21, the Maniot army of 2,000 men under the command of Petros Mavromichalis which also included Theodoros Kolokotronis, marched from Areopolis and headed for Messenia. The next day, they reached Kalamata, which had an Ottoman garrison and they captured the city on March 23.\n\nThe rest of Greece joined the war when Bishop Germanos of Patras declared Greece in rebellion on March 25. At Kalamata, the Greeks established the Messenian Senate which governed affairs in the southern Peloponnese. Kolokotronis wanted to attack Tripoli but Petros Mavromichalis convinced him to attack the smaller towns first. Petrobey also sent letters to the courts of Europe telling them of the Greeks' plan. Petrobey finished off the letters by signing it with \"Petrobey Mavromichalis, Prince and Commander-in-Chief\". On April 28, the Maniot army joined Kolokotronis forces at Karytainia. From there they went to Tripoli and started to besiege the city. The city eventually fell on September 23, 1821 and was sacked by the Greeks.\n\nDue to the unrelenting losses and stories of Greek atrocities in Tripolis, the Sultan became desperate and in 1824 he called on his Viceroy in Egypt, Muhammad Ali, to aid him. Ali promised to aid him in return for cession of the island of Crete, Cyprus, as well as making his son Ibrahim Pasha, Pasha of the Peloponnese. After his offer was accepted, Ali sent his son in command of the expedition. Meanwhile, the Greeks were in disarray because of political rivalries which had caused a civil war. Kolokotronis was arrested, his son Panos was killed, and his nephew Nikitaras forced to flee.\n\nIbrahim used the confusion to land at Methoni in the Peloponnese. From Methoni, Ibrahim started pillaging the Peloponnese and taking many people as slaves. Ibrahim captured Tripolis but was stopped from capturing Nauplion by Kostantinos Mavromichalis and Dimitrios Ypsilantis. In retaliation, Ibrahim burnt down Argos before returning to Tripoli. Ibrahim decided to go with his army and join Reshid Pasha at Missolonghi in Central Greece. The Egyptians reached the city on December 12, 1825 and helped the Ottomans with the siege. On April 10, 1826, the city fell to the invaders and the city was sacked.\n\nIbrahim sent an envoy to Mani demanding its surrender or else he would pillage it. He received the Maniotic reply of:\n\nFrom the few Greeks of Mani and the rest of Greeks who live there to Ibrahim Pasha. We received your letter in which you try to frighten us saying that if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why we are waiting for you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign and wait for you.\n\nIbrahim, furious with the response, ordered an attack on northwestern Mani from Kalamata on June 23, 1826. Under his command was a force of 7,000 men, a mixture of infantry and cavalry. The invaders were forced to stop at the fortifications of the Maniots at Vergas near Almiro. Defending the walls were 2,000 Maniot soldiers and 500 Greek refugees.\n\nThe Egyptian artillery failed to breach the walls, so Ibrahim decided to launch two ships with cannons and have them bombard the Maniot defences from the sea. He also combined this attack with infantry assaults, however these failed as the invaders were driven back from the walls eight times. The attacks lasted for a few more days before the Egyptians and Ottomans were forced to retreat when news arrived that Kolokotronis was approaching their rear with 2,000 men. The Maniots chased the Egyptians up to Kalamata before withdrawing. Ibrahim lost 2,500 men at Vergas and the Greek losses are unknown.\n\nDuring the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim decided to attack the Maniots from the rear. His plan was to send a small fleet with a few soldiers to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis. The aim of this was to capture the unguarded Areopoli, which cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas and demoralize them as well. He would then be able to attack the Maniots from the rear and control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. Authors Peter Greenhalgh and Edward Eliopoulos describe this plan as \"excellent\".\n\nOn June 23, he sent a small fleet carrying 1,500 to land at the Bay of Diros and to capture Areopolis. Aid came from other villages. On June 26, the surviving Egyptians were rescued by Ibrahim's fleet from the beach and those who were not rescued had to swim to the ships or be killed by the Maniots. This battle cost Ibrahim 1,000 men and he was forced to retreat from Mani after being defeated at Vergas.\n\nAfter his retreat from Mani due to the defeats at Vergas and Diros Pasha renewed his offensive in August. Ibrahim's army was led by a Laconian from Bardounia named Bosinas who had assistance from the Egyptian fleet. On August 27, he reached Kariopoli in an attempt to take a safe path through the mountains. Before he reached the town of Polytsaravos, his army of 8,000 Egyptians was delayed by Theodoros Stathakos and his family of thirteen men who refused to let the invaders past their tower. Bosinas tried to negotiate with Stathakos. Stathakos, feigning surrender, told Bosinas to come and take his family's guns. As Bosinas came to retrieve the guns, the Stathakos family killed him. In retaliation, the Egyptians used their two cannons and blew up the tower.\n\nThe Egyptians then proceeded towards the town of Polytsaravos and reached it on August 28. Awaiting them there were 2,000 Maniots behind their fortifications. The Maniots had chosen Polytsaravos as their position of defence as it was on high ground and was surrounded by rocky slopes. This would have meant that the Egyptians could have been stopped before they arrived at the town. As part of their defence plan the villages sent all the women and children to the mountains before improving the fortifications. As the Egyptians arrived at the walls, the Maniots sallied out and caught the Egyptians by surprise. The Egyptians, suffering losses, withdrew from Mani and back into the Laconian plain. The Egyptians had lost 400 men during the battle and the Maniots only lost 9. This was the last invasion launched against Mani.\n\nEven though this campaign is overshadowed by other battles of the revolution, it was one of the most important. The Maniates stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha who had not been defeated this decisively before. The women who defeated the Egyptians at Diros have been given the name of 'The Amazons of Diros'. This was the last invasion of Mani as Ibrahim abandoned any ideas of conquering it. On the April 26, 1827 the Turkish navy bombarded Oitylo with over 1,700 cannonballs hitting the town.\n\nIn 1827, the combined fleets of France, England and Russia defeated the combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleet in the Battle of Navarino. In 1828, under the terms of the London Protocol, Greece became an independent state which was recognized by the Ottomans in 1829. When Ioannis Capodistrias was made president of Greece, he had Petrobey Mavromichalis imprisoned. The Mavromichalis' reacted by assassinating Capodistrias in Nauplion as he went to church. The Maniots continued causing trouble and defeated two Bavarian armies King Otto sent against them before they were subdued only after some of the leaders were bribed. This ended the Maniots' independence and they were forced to pay taxes.\n\n"}

It is the first of the entire series to not be released exclusively for a PlayStation console. Picking up not long after the events of \"\", the story centers on the appearance of Crunch Bandicoot, a genetically advanced bandicoot created by the main antagonist of the series, Doctor Neo Cortex, who is aided by a group of destructive masks known as the Elementals. Crash Bandicoot and his sister Coco must travel the world and gather special Crystals that will return the Elementals to a hibernated state, and defeat Crunch. \n\nCritical reception of the game was mixed, with many reviewers opining that the game recycled elements from its PlayStation predecessors with minimal innovation. The PlayStation 2 edition sold 1.56 million copies in North America, and the game qualified for various best-seller ranges, including the Platinum Range for PlayStation 2, Xbox Classics, and Player's Choice on GameCube. It was released as a launch title for the Xbox Originals line of downloadable original-Xbox games for the Xbox 360's Live Marketplace service in December 2007.\n\n\"The Wrath of Cortex\" is a platform game in which the player controls Crash and Coco Bandicoot, who must gather 25 Crystals and defeat the main antagonists of the story: Doctor Neo Cortex, his new superweapon Crunch Bandicoot and Crunch's power sources, the renegade Elementals. Much of the game takes place in a \"Virtual Reality (VR) Hub System\" created by Coco to help Crash gather the Crystals. The VR Hub System is split up into five \"VR Hubs\"; initially, only the first VR Hub is available. Each VR Hub has five teleportation portals to different levels. The goal in each level is to find and obtain the Crystal hidden in the area. In some levels, the Crystal will be located at the end of a level or must be earned by completing a specific challenge. Most levels contain a \"Bonus Platform\" that leads to a special bonus area, where the player must navigate through a maze and collect everything in sight. Once a bonus area is completed, it cannot be played again unless the level is replayed. After completing all five levels in a VR Hub, a sixth teleportation portal to a boss fight with Crunch will appear. By defeating the boss, the next VR Hub will become available for play. When all 25 Crystals are collected and Doctor Cortex and Crunch are defeated, the game is won.\n\nBesides Crystals, Gems and Colored Gems can be collected for extra accomplishment. Gems are rewarded to the player if all of the crates in a level are broken open or if a secret area is completed. Colored Gems are found in special levels and lead to hidden areas. \"Relics\" can be won by re-entering a level where the Crystal has already been retrieved. To obtain a Relic, the player must initiate the \"Time Trial\" mode and race through a level in the pre-designated time displayed before entering a level. To begin a Time Trial run, the player must enter a level and activate the floating stopwatch near the beginning of the level to activate the timer; if the stopwatch is not touched, the level can be played regularly. The player must then race through the level as quickly as possible. Scattered throughout the level are yellow crates with the numbers one, two, or three on them. When these crates are broken, the timer is frozen for the number of seconds designated by the box. As no lives are lost in the Time Trial mode, the level can be played through as often as the player desires. Sapphire, Gold and Platinum Relics can be won depending on how low the player's final time is. The first five Relics the player receives unlocks access to a secret level. Every five Relics thereafter open up another level in the Secret Warp Room. The levels in the Secret Warp Room must be won before the game can be fully completed.\n\nCrash and Coco Bandicoot start the game with five lives. Crash and Coco lose a life when they are struck by an enemy attack or suffer any other type of damage. More lives can be earned by collecting 100 \"Wumpa Fruits\" or break open a special crate to collect a life. Crash and Coco can be shielded from enemy attack by collecting an Aku Aku mask. Collecting three of these masks allows temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers. If Crash or Coco run out of lives, the game is over. However, the game can be continued by selecting \"Continue\" at the \"Game over\" screen.\n\nTen returning characters from previous \"Crash\" titles star in \"Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex\" along with five new characters. The protagonist of the game, Crash Bandicoot, is a genetically enhanced eastern barred bandicoot who must defeat the antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and his new superweapon. Coco Bandicoot, Crash's younger sister, is a highly intelligent computer expert with an interest in Hong Kong martial arts films. Aku Aku is an omnipotent witch doctor who guides and aids Crash and Coco in stopping the plans of Doctor Neo Cortex. Pura, Coco's pet tiger cub, serves a very minor role and appears only in the introduction of the game.\n\nThe main antagonist of the series, Doctor Neo Cortex, is a mad scientist who created Crash Bandicoot among other characters and now seeks Crash's elimination along with world domination. The controlling force behind Cortex's plots for conquering the world is Uka Uka, the twin brother of Aku Aku. Four recurring villains from the series serve minor roles in the game: Doctor N. Gin, Cortex's main assistant; Doctor Nefarious Tropy, a scientist who specialises in time travel; Tiny Tiger, a hulking and ferocious thylacine; and Dingodile, a dingo-crocodile hybrid armed with a flamethrower.\n\nFive new characters in the series make their appearance in \"The Wrath of Cortex\", of which the most important is Doctor Cortex's genetically enhanced superweapon Crunch Bandicoot, a bionic bandicoot created for the purpose of destroying Crash Bandicoot. Acting as Crunch's power source are the Elementals, a group of destructive masks who control the elements of Earth, Water, Fire and Air. The Elementals consist of Rok-Ko, a temperamental and rock-headed earthbending mask who controls earthquakes and landslides, Wa-Wa, a waterbending mask who controls thunderstorms and floods, Py-Ro, an easily perturbed firebending mask who controls volcano eruptions, and Lo-Lo, a joke-cracking airbending mask who controls tornadoes.\n\nOutraged by their \"track record for spreading evil\", Uka Uka orders Doctor Neo Cortex, Tiny Tiger, Dingodile, Dr. Nefarius Tropy and Dr. N. Gin to devise a plan to eliminate Crash Bandicoot. Cortex reluctantly comes forward with the announcement of a previously secret \"genetically enhanced superweapon of unbelievable strength\", but reveals that it is missing a power source. Uka Uka then suggests using the Elementals, a group of renegade masks who had elemental power over earth, water, fire, and air and were used to ravage the globe. The elements caused earthquakes, floods, and an Ice Age many centuries ago until they were imprisoned by The Ancients with the aid of special Crystals that put the masks in a state of hibernation. Cortex deduces that if they awaken the Elementals and harness their destructive power, they can bring his secret weapon to life and eliminate Crash Bandicoot forever.\n\nBack on Earth, the world is suddenly terrorised by severe natural disasters, leading Aku Aku to realize that Uka Uka has released the Elementals. Aku Aku returns to Crash and Coco Bandicoot and alerts them of the current situation, disclosing that the only way to stop the Elementals is to imprison them once more with the Crystals, which have been scattered across the Earth. Using Coco's new Virtual Reality Hub System, Crash and Coco travel the world and gather the Crystals, fending off attacks from Cortex's superweapon, Crunch Bandicoot, and the Elementals along the way. However, by the time the Crystals have been gathered and the Elementals have been put in their hibernation state, Crunch's elemental powers have reached maximum capacity, forcing Crash to battle Crunch at full power in Cortex's space station. Nevertheless, Crash defeats Crunch, which releases him from Cortex's control. Infuriated by this failure, Uka Uka attacks Cortex with a fireball, only to have it hit a vital part of the space station, which causes a chain reaction that results in the space station's self-destruction. Crash, Aku Aku, and Crunch escape and return to the Bandicoot home on Coco's space fighter ship, while Cortex and Uka Uka deploy an escape pod and end up landing somewhere in Antarctica, where Uka Uka furiously chases Cortex around a small ice floe.\n\n\"The Wrath of Cortex\" was originally intended to be designed by Mark Cerny, who had designed all the games in the series thus far, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game under Cerny's direction was to be a free-roaming title with puzzle elements that would see Crash travelling between different planets. In early 2000, when Universal approached Traveller's Tales to be the development team behind the game, they produced a 3-D rendered demo of Crash running through a volcanic level. Development of the game's engine began in mid-2000. It was originally titled \"Crash Bandicoot Worlds\".\nOn September 21, 2000, Universal Interactive Studios and Konami announced that they had entered an agreement that would enable Konami to publish a \"Crash Bandicoot\" game for next-generation game systems, with Universal Interactive handling the production of the games. The agreement served to break the \"Crash Bandicoot\" franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles and effectively made Crash Bandicoot a mascot character for Universal rather than Sony. After Universal fell out with Cerny and Sony, Traveller's Tales was forced to alter the game from a free-roaming title to a standard \"Crash\" title. Traveller's Tales had to begin development of the game from scratch and were given only twelve months to complete the game.\n\nThe character Crunch Bandicoot was designed by Craig Whittle of Traveller's Tales and Sean Krankel of Universal. The concept of battling mini-bosses within the game's levels was dropped to uphold the fast and frantic pace of the series' gameplay. Multiplayer capability was also considered before being dropped. An earlier draft of the story featured an alternate version of the game's climax and ending, which involved Crash battling Crunch in a mechanical robot suit. At the end of the fight, Crunch would destroy Crash's suit with a bolt of electricity. The resulting debris would render Cortex unconscious, destroy the remote control device controlling Crunch and start an electrical fire in the space station. As the Bandicoots escape to resume their beach-going vacation, the ruins of the space station would crash-land onto the island of Cortex's original settlement, conveniently allowing Cortex and Uka Uka to resume their world domination bids.\n\nThe majority of the characters and vehicles in the game were built and textured by Nicola Daly and animated by Jeremy Pardon. The main game systems and game code as a whole were coded by John Hodskinson. The game's music is composed by Andy Blythe and Marten Joustra of Swallow Studios. A rearranged version of the original \"Crash Bandicoot\" theme by Mutato Muzika's Josh Mancell also appears in the game. The game's sound effects were created by Ron Horwitz, Tom Jaeger, John Robinson, and Harry Woolway of Universal Sound Studios. The game's voice actors were cast and directed by Margaret Tang. Clancy Brown voices the dual role of Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka, while Mel Winkler provides the voice of Aku Aku. Crash and Coco Bandicoot are respectively voiced by Brendan O'Brien and Debi Derryberry. Corey Burton voices the returning villains Doctor N. Gin and Doctor Nefarious Tropy. Kevin Michael Richardson provides the voice of new character Crunch Bandicoot, while the Elementals, consisting of Rok-Ko, Wa-Wa, Py-Ro and Lo-Lo, are voiced by Thomas F. Wilson, R. Lee Ermey, Mark Hamill, and Jess Harnell respectively.\n\n\"The Wrath of Cortex\" was released onto the PlayStation 2 on October 29, 2001. The Xbox version of the game was announced by Universal Interactive on January 31, 2002, and features reduced loading times and improved graphics. On September 17, 2002, the game was released on the GameCube, initially in North America. Commercially, the PlayStation 2 version sold over 1.56 million units in North America, and around 170,000 copies in 2001 in Japan. The PlayStation 2 version also received a \"Double Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. As a result, the game was re-released for the Platinum Range on October 11, 2002, for the Sony Greatest Hits line-up on October 15, 2002, and for the Best line-up on October 17, 2002. The \"Greatest Hits\" version of the game features quicker load times than those of the original version. The Xbox version was re-released for the Xbox Classics line-up on April 11, 2003, and the GameCube version was re-released for the Player's Choice line-up in Europe on October 22, 2004.\n\n\"The Wrath of Cortex\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics from GameZone, GamePro, IGN, \"Game Informer\", \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", and \"Official Xbox Magazine\" felt it repeated the formula established by its predecessors. Louis Bedigian of GameZone wrote a positive review, saying that he spent a lot of time playing the game. Doug Perry of IGN described the game as \"decent-playing and pretty-looking\" although nothing special. \"Official US PlayStation Magazine\" felt that the previous game was much better. \"Game Informer\" criticized the load times, saying that they contribute to making it a below average game. Star Dingo of \"GamePro\" criticised the new management system. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" criticised the trial-and-error gameplay, describing it as \"cheating.\" \"Play Magazine\" noted that the music had improved, the bosses were more challenging, and it great replayable value. Hilary Goldstein felt that while \"Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex\" was \"a fun game\" its game balance and sound let it down.\n\nThe GameCube version rated the lowest among critics out of the 3 versions. Ben Kosmina of Nintendo World Report promised that \"gamers experiencing the wacky mascot for the first time may enjoy it.\" Michael Lafferty of GameZone described the game as \"safe, sterile and redundant.\" \"Nintendo Power\" praised the \"sheer variety\" of the gameplay. Kilo Watt of GamePro said that \"graphically, this version is slightly below the recent Xbox release but in line with the competent PlayStation 2 iteration.\" \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" agreed that \"\"Wrath\" on the GC is much more polished here than on the PS2,\" while \"Play Magazine\" denounced the GameCube version as \"a shell of the other two console versions\".\n\nJeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"Even with the relatively low bar of just offering more of the same, this still comes up kinda short.\"\n\n"}

Unlike previous games in the beat 'em up genre, Dynasty Warriors 2 allowed players the freedom to roam to any point within the limits of the current stage being played.\n\nThis game was the first to introduce Free Mode and Musou Mode to the series. The Free Mode allowed the player to replay any missions that they have already completed in Musou Mode. The Musou Mode is the character's main story, where you play as the officer until the kingdom you are fighting for has unified China. However, due to the small scale of the game at the time, many important battles were missing.

The airport is southwest of the intersection of Route 630 and U.S. Route 1 near Interstate 95, approximately south of Washington, D.C. and north of Richmond. It is owned and operated by the Stafford Regional Airport Authority, an independent body of representatives from Stafford and Prince William Counties and the City of Fredericksburg.\n\nAlthough most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, Stafford Regional Airport is assigned RMN by the FAA but has no designation from the IATA (which assigned RMN to Rumginae, Papua New Guinea).\n\nStafford Regional Airport covers an area of which contains one asphalt paved runway (15/33) measuring 5,000 x 100 ft (1,524 x 30 m).

{"id": "2146729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146729", "title": "Dynasty Warriors 3", "text": "Dynasty Warriors 3\n\n\"Dynasty Warriors 3\" was the first in the series to introduce a two player mode and numerous other improvements over \"Dynasty Warriors 2\". New stages, characters, weapons, attacks and music are introduced providing a completely new experience to a player that has played \"Dynasty Warriors 2\" before. The gameplay engine and the graphics engine have also been updated, providing higher quality environments, textures and general overall graphics. Only one expansion was released for the game, \"Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends\" and it was the first in the \"Xtreme Legends\" series.\n\nIn \"Dynasty Warriors 3\" the player takes control of an officer and must attempt to defeat the enemy commander. The player must make their way through the stage defeating soldiers and enemy officers while trying to keep their commander alive. As well as hundreds of soldiers in each stage, there are stage specific events to complete that can help the player's army and raise their morale. A higher morale means allied soldiers will attack more frequently and will be more likely to follow through with their combination attacks. To make this possible, officers and commanders have superhuman abilities and have the capability to kill hundreds of enemy soldiers per stage.\n\nThe main play mode of the game is Musou mode, the story mode of the \"Dynasty Warriors\" series. Each playable character of the three main nations have their own Musou mode which consists of a number of stages that resemble events in \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\". The Musou mode for each character is a linear story where the user cannot change how the story progresses. The story progression for Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Jian and officers from their respective kingdoms have the closest relation to the \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" story.\n\nInitially there are 15 available characters to play as, new and returning characters can be unlocked by performing special events during battle or simply meeting them during battle. Each playable character has their own unique weapon that can be upgraded and allows for a maximum of 4 levels of weapon. When the next level of weapon is obtained, its strength is greater than the level below it and adds one extra attack to the player's maximum number of attacks.\n\nItems are also hidden throughout stages and can also be obtained by defeating officers. There are three types of items in game, normal items, red items and weapons which can be equipped before the stage begins and will increase the player's statistics. Red items are specialised items than cause a special effect, such as starting the stage mounted on a horse or giving the player the ability to shoot fire arrows.\n\n\"Dynasty Warriors 3\" has an RPG element to it where the player can increase the attack, defence, life bar or Musou bar of the characters. This can be achieved by defeating enemy officers and gate captains who will drop items that will increase the aforementioned statistics. Although it is not necessary to collect these items, it is helpful to the player as in later stages as enemies grow in strength.\n\nThe two player mode (new to \"Dynasty Warriors 3\") allows players to either go head-to-head in one-on-one fights or play co-operatively in any of the stages. The screen is split horizontally with player one on top and the second below. In one-on-one fights the characters statistics are reduced to their default to allow for a fair battle, relying more on the player's skill rather than who has the stronger character. In co-operative play the characters retain their saved statistics, there are no alterations to the stage and the players gain the ability to perform a more powerful version of their Musou attack (\"Special Attack\"). If the players perform their Musou attack at the same time within range of each other, the attack gains a lightning element and deals extra damage to enemies that are hit.\n\n\"Dynasty Warriors 3\" is set across ancient China in the Three Kingdoms era. The game begins at the fall of the Han dynasty shortly after the death of the Emperor Ling when the leader of the Way of Peace, Zhang Jiao, led an uprising against the Empire.\n\nThe game features a strong mix of fact and fiction from Chinese history and often exaggerates characters and their personalities. For example, Lu Bu is portrayed as a virtually unbeatable, violent maniac. Most of the events and stages are reported to have occurred in the Three Kingdoms era during the struggle of power. The three kingdoms primarily involved, Shu, Wu and Wei, each sought power enough to overthrow the other two and unify China under their rule. Although the story in \"Dynasty Warriors\" is not perfect in the sense that it does not accurately follow the historical events, it has been changed to make the game more playable and less repetitive. For example, a number of the characters in the game died in the time frame that the game is set, but they still appear in later stages. The game features environments resembling that of ancient China and various items from the era such as fairy wine and dim sum.\n\nIt also touches on mysticism as some characters (Zhuge Liang, Sima Yi, Pang Tong) have either magical elements in their attacks or completely magical attacks.\n\nMany of the stages are recreations of notable battles present historically or from the novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", while original creations became more common with the newer installments.\n\n\"* Denotes new characters to the series\"<br>\n\"Bold denotes default characters\"\n\nThe characters in \"Dynasty Warriors 3\" are based around real and semi-fictional characters from \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" and that era, where some characters personalities and traits have been exaggerated and where some remain fairly true to the novel. Females of that era did not participate in any of the battles but there are a number of female playable characters in the game (Diao Chan, Xiao Qiao, Da Qiao, Zhen Ji, Sun Shang Xiang, Zhu Rong, Nu Wa). Zhu Rong and Nu Wa are exceptions as Zhu Rong was said to be the only female to have fought in that era and Nu Wa's character is fictional and based on ancient myth.\n\nThe game was highly anticipated after its release being announced because of its numerous new features and improvements of the last in the series. Afterwards, it was met with positive to average reception upon release; GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 77% and 78 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version, and 76% and 70 out of 100 for the Xbox version.\n\nIn just under four months, over 1 million copies of \"Dynasty Warriors 3\" had been sold in North America and Japan combined and made it the first of Koei's games to pass one million sales on a single platform and making it a platinum title. Not only that but it topped the sales charts for five consecutive weeks and, according to \"Famitsu\", it was ranked the 9th best selling game of 2001.\n\n\"Dynasty Warriors 3\" still retains a number of the bad features that were in the previous game such as fogging and low quality English voice actors. Although the English voices were poor (they have gained a cult-like status among fans of the series), the player has the choice to turn on Japanese voices and they are considered to be of a much higher quality. IGN strongly criticized the Xbox version over the sound, both music and the voice acting. Despite a number of negative points coming up throughout the review it scored 6.8/10 and the reviewer saw it had potential to become a very good game.\n\n\"Famitsu\" gave the PS2 version 34 out of 40. Chi Kong Lui of GameCritics.com looked past the sound and graphical flaws and concentrated more on the gameplay and setting, giving a high score of 9/10. He gave high praise to how much the game was based on the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms story and even went as far as saying \"All the costuming of the 3D models is ethnically authentic and beautifully lavished\" whereas a number of reviews described the graphical quality as being plain and blurry (Such as the said IGN review). It is also notable that the IGN review was based on the PS2 version, which has more fog and slowdown (especially in multi-player) when compared to the Xbox version, and those were his two heaviest faults of the game.\n\nOn March 6, 2003, Dynasty Warriors 3 received \"Animation Magazine\" \"Best Overall Game Animation\" award. This was Koei's first award for a Dynasty Warriors game.\n\nDynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends (真・三國無双2 猛将伝 (\"Shin Sangokumusou 2 Moushouden\") in Japan)) is the first Xtreme Legends installment by publisher Koei and developer Omega Force. This expansion to \"Dynasty Warriors 3\" was released on January 11, 2003 within the US and Europe.\n\n\"Xtreme Legends\" added several new features to \"Dynasty Warriors 3\", including new items and the ability to fully customize bodyguards. \"Xtreme Legends\" also included a Musou Mode for the playable characters who did not belong to either Wu, Wei, or Shu (Diao Chan, Lu Bu, Zhang Jiao, Dong Zhuo, Yuan Shao, Zhu Rong and Meng Huo). \"Xtreme Legends\" also allowed players to obtain a fifth-level weapon for each character and added two new difficulty levels: Beginner and Expert. (Otherwise referred to as \"Very Hard\" in game, respectively.)\n\nThe player can also import content from the DW3 disc while playing Xtreme Legends by using the \"Load Original\" option. If played by itself, DW3:XL only features its own scenarios and Musou modes. It can, however, copy data from a previously saved DW3 file on the memory card, but only if there's already a DW3 data before creating DW3:XL save data.\n\n\"Xtreme Legends\" was met with average reception upon release, as GameRankings gave it a score of 71%, while Metacritic gave it 72 out of 100. \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 33 out of 40.\n\n"}
{"id": "2146732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146732", "title": "Die Forelle", "text": "Die Forelle\n\n\"\" (German for \"The Trout\"), Op. 32, 550. is a lied, or song, composed in early 1817 for solo voice and piano with music by the Austrian composer Franz Schubert (1797–1828). Schubert chose to set the text of a poem by Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart, first published in the \"\" in 1783. The full poem tells the story of a trout being caught by a fisherman, but in its final stanza reveals its purpose as a moral piece warning young women to guard against young men. When Schubert set the poem to music, he removed the last verse, which contained the moral, changing the song's focus and enabling it to be sung by male or female singers. Schubert produced six subsequent copies of the work, all with minor variations.\n\nSchubert wrote \"\" in the single key of D-flat major with a varied (or modified) strophic form. The first two verses have the same structure but change for the final verse to give a musical impression of the trout being caught. In the Deutsch catalogue of Schubert's works it is number 550, or D. 550. The musicologist Marjorie Wing Hirsch describes its type in the Schubert lieder as a \"lyrical song with admixtures of dramatic traits\".\n\nThe song was popular with contemporary audiences, which led to Schubert being commissioned to write a piece of chamber music based on the song. This commission resulted in the \"Trout Quintet\" (D. 667), in which a set of variations of \"\" are present in the fourth movement.\n\nThe lyrics of the lied are from a poem by Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart. Opinion is divided on his abilities: \"The Musical Times\" considers him to be \"one of the feeblest poets\" whose work was used by Schubert, and comments that he \"was content with versifying pretty ideas\", while the singer and author Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau considered Schubart to be \"a very talented poet, musician and orator\". Schubart wrote \"\" in 1782, while imprisoned in the fortress of Hohenasperg; he was a prisoner there from 1777 to 1787 for insulting the mistress of Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg. The poem was published in the \"Schwäbischer Musenalmanach\" of 1783, consisting of four stanzas.\n\nThe Schubert scholar John Reed thought the poem to be \"sentimental\" and \"feeble\", with the final stanza of the poem consisting of a \"smug moral\" that \"pointedly advises young girls to be on their guard against young men with rods\". The academic Thomas Kramer observes that \"\" is \"somewhat unusual with its mock-naive pretense of being about a bona fide fish\", whereas he describes it as \"a sexual parable\". Fischer-Dieskau saw the poem as \"didactic ... with its Baroque moral\". Schubert did not set this final stanza, however, and instead concentrated on a person's observation of the trout and the reaction to its being caught by a fisherman.\n\nIn 1815 Schubert wrote a series of twenty songs based on the works of Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten (1758–1818). Among them was \"\" (D 229), written in July that year; John Reed sees the song as a forerunner to \"\", observing that \"\" and other similar songs, \"convey an intensity of feeling that belies their small scale\". From the following year to 1821 Schubert composed four songs using the poems of Schubart, \"\" (D518), \"\" (D342), \"\" (D550) and \"\" (D454). Although the first draft of \"\" was lost and the exact date of composition is unknown, the lied is known to have been written in early 1817, the same year he composed \"Der Tod und das Mädchen\" and \"An die Musik\".\n\nAfter Schubert completed the song, one of his friends, Johann Leopold Ebner, recounted that Schubert was told that \"\" unconsciously quoted Beethoven's \"Coriolan Overture\"; on hearing the comparison, Schubert decided to destroy the manuscript, but he was stopped by Ebner and others. On 9 December 1820 the song was published in a supplement to the \"Wiener Zeitung\", along with a number of others of Schubert's lieder. He received no payment for publishing his songs, but was provided with free publicity.\n\n\"\" is written for solo voice and piano in the key of D major. The song is written with a varied (or modified) strophic structure, meaning the \"verse music\" is generally the same, with one different verse. According to the American historian Mark Ringer, Schubert used a \"musical structure that reflects both the life cycle of the earth and the progress from innocence to experience\". Schubert directed the piece to be played \"Etwas lebhaft\", or at a \"somewhat lively\" pace.\n\nThe different verse is the third, and it demonstrates the \"admixture of dramatic traits\" in the lyrical song, which Fischer-Dieskau calls \"a classic example of the strophic song with \"Abgesang\" ... 'after-strain'.\" The \"after-strain\" comes at the final stanza; the composer and Schubert scholar Brian Newbould observed that for three-quarters of the song's final stanza, Schubert departed from the strophe to give a musical impression of the trout being caught, but returned to the strophe for the final couplet. The primary rhythmic figure in the piano accompaniment suggests the movement of the fish in the water. When the fisherman catches the trout, the vocal line changes from major to minor, the piano figuration becomes darker and the flowing phrases are \"broken by startled rests\". According to Mark Ringer, the melody evokes a \"folklike naïveté\" that \"delivers both delight and emotional power\".\n\nSchubart's poem takes the viewpoint of a male speaker, advising women to be careful of young men. By removing the stanza, Schubert removes the moral and creates uncertainty in the sex of the narrator.\n\nAfter completing his original in 1817, Schubert made six subsequent autographs. These differing versions were not necessarily an attempt to improve a work, with some later versions being written from memory with only minor variations; Newbould considers that Schubert's close replication was a \"feat of musicianship ... and a sign that Schubert spoke the language of music with the naturalness of conversation.\" The differences between the autographs are small: according to Reed, they \"are concerned ... with the tempo indication and the prelude – postlude.\" The first version, marked \"Mässig\", has no introduction, although \"the shape of the familiar introduction is already adumbrated in a seven-bar postlude\". The draft is undated, although is from 1817 and is kept in the Stadler, Ebner and Schindler collection in Lund. A second copy, written in May or June 1817, was for Franz Sales Kandler's album: this version was marked \"Nicht zu geschwind\" (not too fast).\n\nA third variation was written during the night of 21 February 1818. Schubert and Anselm Hüttenbrenner, a friend and fellow composer, had finished a few bottles of Hungarian wine when Anselm commented that his brother Josef was an aficionado of Schubert's work. Schubert completed a copy of \"\" that was \"somewhat messy\". The messiness was partly accounted for by Schubert's drunken state, but also explained by the accompanying note he wrote to Josef: \"Just as, in my haste, I was going to send the thing, I rather sleepily took up the ink-well and poured it calmly over it. What a disaster!\" The manuscript was held by the Hüttenbrenner family for a number of years and was photographed in 1870, before being lost. Schubert wrote a further version in 1820 for publication in the \"Wiener Zeitung\", and a final copy in October 1821 for publication in the \"Neue Ausgabe\". The final version has \"a five-bar piano prelude\" and is presently in the Gertrude Clarke Whittall Foundation Collection of the Library of Congress.\n\nIn 1819 Sylvester Baumgartner—a music patron and amateur cellist in Steyr—commissioned Schubert to write a piece of chamber music based on \"\"; Schubert then wrote a quintet for piano and strings in which he quoted the song in a set of variations in the fourth movement. The piece later became known as the \"Trout Quintet\" (D. 667). Franz Liszt transcribed and paraphrased \"\" in two versions for solo piano. The first was in 1844 as the sixth part of his composition \"Sechs Melodien von Franz Schubert\" (S 560); the second transcription was in 1846 (S 564).\n\nInformation regarding the contemporary reception to \"\" is scant. Reed relates that the song had \"immediate popularity\", and that Schubert composing the \"Trout Quintet\" was evidence that \"\" \"was already widely known\" by 1819. Newbould agrees, pointing out that the quintet was \"acknowledging the song's meteoric rise up early nineteenth-century Vienna's equivalent to the charts\". Fischer-Dieskau takes a longer-term view of the song's popularity, writing that \"the vividness of the imagery, with the alternate troubling and smoothing of the surface of the water along with the exuberance of the melody itself, account for the song's universal appeal\".\n\nNotes\nReferences\n"}

D. \"Jay\" Miller, and originally recorded by Kitty Wells. It was an answer song to the Hank Thompson hit \"The Wild Side of Life.\" \n\nThe song — which blamed unfaithful men for creating unfaithful women — became the first No. 1 \"Billboard\" country hit for a solo woman artist. In addition to helping establish Wells as country music's first major woman star, \"It Wasn't God...\" paved the way for other women artists, particularly Dolly Parton, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, and Tammy Wynette, and songs where women call out unfaithful men.\n\nIt was preserved by the National Recording Registry in 2007.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Wells had recorded on RCA Victor, but had little success there. By 1952, she was recording on Decca Records, and recorded \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\" at her first recording session.\n\nIn \"The Wild Side of Life,\" Thompson expresses regret his bride-to-be has left him for another man whom she met in a roadhouse, stating, \"I didn't know that God made honky tonk angels.\" That song and its appeal to people who \"thought the world was going to hell and that faithless women deserved a good deal of the blame...just begged for an answer from a woman\".\n\nThe rebuttal song, as it turned out, was written by Jay Miller, although it was Wells who made it a hit. In \"It Wasn't God...\" – which follows the same melody, but more uptempo – she cites the original song and counters that, for every woman who had been led astray, it was a man who led her there (often through his own infidelity). She also expresses frustration about how women are always made scapegoats for the man's faults in a given relationship.\n\nRefrain:\n\nWells' statement was a rather daring one to make in 1952, particularly in the conservative, male-dominated realm of country music; women's liberation and their sentiments in song were still more than 10 years away. There was plenty of resistance to the song and its statement: the NBC radio network banned the song for being \"suggestive,\" while Wells was prohibited from performing it on the Grand Ole Opry and NBC's \"Prince Albert\" radio program.\n\nYet Wells struck a chord with her fans, as \"It Wasn't God...\" went to number one for six weeks on \"Billboard magazine\"'s country charts. In topping the charts, Wells became the first woman to ever accomplish the feat, at least as a solo act; if all female singers are considered, then Margaret Whiting gets the honor (in a 1949 duet No. 1 with Jimmy Wakely called \"Slippin' Around\").\n\nWells was at first reluctant to record the song, but eventually agreed, if only to get the standard $125 session fee payment. Eventually, \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky-Tonk Angels\" outsold Thompson's \"The Wild Side of Life,\" and launched the then little-known Wells to stardom. Years later, Wells told an interviewer she was shocked over the song's success and endurance. \"Women never had hit records in those days. Very few of them even recorded. I couldn't believe it happened,\" she said.\n\nHistorian Charles Wolfe noted \"It Wasn't God...\" was one of the few notable exceptions to the rule of an answer song not enjoying the same success as the original.\n\n\"The Wild Side of Life\" and \"It Wasn't God ...\" are set to an apparently traditional tune used in the song \"Thrills That I Can't Forget\" recorded by Welby Toomey and Edgar Boaz in 1925, and more familiarly in the Carter Family's \"I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes\" recorded in February, 1929, as well as the Rev. Guy Smith's \"Great Speckled Bird\"—popularized in 1936 by Roy Acuff. In view of the common associations and Wells' 1959 \"Great Speckled Bird\" recording, the correspondence was hardly accidental.\n\nThe connection between these songs is noted in the David Allan Coe song \"If That Ain't Country\" that ends with the lyrics \"I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes/ Concerning a great speckled bird/ I didn't know God made honky-tonk angels/ and went back to the wild side of life.\"\n\nIn addition to Wells' vocals, husband Johnnie Wright played bass guitar and Jack Anglin played rhythm guitar. Paul Warren played fiddle and Shot Jackson played steel guitar, traits prevalent on many of Wells' biggest hits.\n\nSeveral cover versions of the song have been recorded, including the following:\n\nIn 1976, Marianne Faithful recorded a version of the song in her album Dreamin' My Dreams also later reissued as Faithless but it is named as Honky Tonk Angels in both recordings.

Over the time prior to production the car went through a number of improvements in performance, technology, updated styling exercises, as well as color changes. The car was displayed at international auto shows worldwide, and featured in many automotive publications. Between 1978 and 1987, Wiegert attempted to raise the money to start series of the car. In its lifetime, the car covered over in testing, more than any other concept car.

Also known as Mōko no Tora (蒙古の虎 \"Mongolian Tiger\"), he is attributed as a martial arts master by members of the Bujinkan organization. Hatsumi reports that Takamatsu traveled through Mongolia to China at the age of 21, teaching martial arts and fighting a number of life or death battles. He was married to Uno Tane. They adopted a girl named Yoshiko. His father (Takamatsu Gishin Yasaburo) owned a match-factory and received Dai-Ajari (Master) title in Kumano Shugendo (a type of Shingon Buddhism). His dojo was named \"Sakushin\" (Cultivating Spirit). His house was in front of Kashihara Shrine in Kashihara, Nara. Takamatsu died on 2 April 1972 of illness. His inheritor was Masaaki Hatsumi who founded the Bujinkan system and its art of Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu and Shoto Tanemura who founded the Genbukan Ninpo Bugei system.\n\nTakamatsu's claim to lineage in ninjutsu has been disputed by a few individuals. The 1963 version of the Bugei Ryūha Daijiten indicates of Takamatsu's Togakure-ryu: \"this genealogy refers to various written records and oral transmissions and there are many points/places where embellishments have been added and people appearing in the genealogy are also made older than they actually are. Thus the genealogy can be considered to be something that [Takamatsu's teacher Toda] Shinryūken newly arranged around the end of the Tokugawa shōgunate.\" The Iga-ryū Ninja Museum lists as the only legitimate inheritor of authentic ninjutsu as Jinichi Kawakami, although this is likely to be a biased opinion as Jinichi Kawakami is also the honorary director of the Iga-ryū Ninja Museum, a commercial enterprise and tourist attraction. In the words of martial arts author Donn Draeger: \"The late Fujita Seiko was the last of the living ninja, having served in assignments for the Imperial Government during the Taisho and Showa eras. Modern authorities such as T. Hatsumi are responsible for most research being done on ninjutsu.\"\n\n"}

Roosevelt. The organization was created to provide secure normal, secret, and emergency communications requirements in support of the President. The organization provided mobile radio, Teletype, telegraph, telephone and cryptographic aides in the White House and at \"Shangri-La\" (now known as Camp David). The organizational mission was to provide a premier communication system that would enable the President to lead the nation effectively.\n\nIn 1954, during the Eisenhower administration, the WHSD was reorganized under the Office of the Chief Signal Officer, Army Signal Corps as a Class II unit and renamed the White House Army Signal Agency (WHASA). In 1962, WHASA was discontinued by order of the United States Secretary of Defense under President John F. Kennedy. Its duties were transferred to the auspices of the Defense Communications Agency under the operational control of the White House Military Office, and reestablished as the White House Communications Agency.\n\nWHCA has played an unremarked, but significant role in many historical events, including: World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Panama and Guatemala, Operation Just Cause, Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. WHCA was also a key player in documenting the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the attempted assassinations of Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. Richard Nixon awarded the agency the Presidential Unit Citation in recognition of their performance during his 1972 visit to China.\n\nThe White House Communications Agency is composed of Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps personnel. The Agency evolved over the past 60 years from a small team of 32 personnel working out of the basement of the White House to a thousand-person self-supporting joint service command. Headquarters for WHCA is at Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling and consists of six staff elements and seven organizational units. WHCA also has supporting detachments in Washington, D.C. and various locations throughout the United States. WHCA is organized into functional areas, each with its own mission in support of the total WHCA mission of Presidential support.\n\nThe White House Communications Agency is a joint military unit. It has members from each branch of service: United States Air Force (USAF), United States Army (USA), United State Coast Guard (USCG), United States Marine Corps (USMC), United States Space Force (USSF) and the United States Navy (USN). They are stringently vetted before being admitted. After meritorious service of 365 days, typically, its uniformed service members are awarded the Presidential Service Badge.\n\nWHCA also maintains many civilian employees throughout the agency and satellite locations.\n\nAn agreement between Marine Corps Barracks, Washington, D.C., and the White House Communications Agency states that the barracks will supply WHCA with a platoon to provide security for the WHCA compound and for WHCA missions overseas.

His father died on 23 March 1933 after catching pneumonia from the effects of taking an overdose of morphine in a suicide attempt, and Scott-Ford changed his surname in an attempt to improve his social status. He was educated at the Royal Hospital School, Holbrook from 1933 to 1937, and then on turning 16, enlisted in the Royal Navy and joined the shore establishment HMS \"Impregnable\" in Devonport in December 1937.\n\nIn June 1939 Scott-Ford was serving on HMS \"Gloucester\" which had called at Dar-es-Salaam on a goodwill visit. He met and became infatuated by a German girl; the Security Service later came to believe that he may have told her secret naval codes. Later in 1940 his ship was stationed in Egypt and Scott-Ford became obsessed with a prostitute whom he often visited; he was discovered to have altered the book of his Post Office Savings account and sent to a court martial which convicted him. He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and dismissed from the service with ignominy but, after a successful appeal by his mother, the sentence was remitted to six months' imprisonment and an honourable discharge.\n\nRepatriated to Britain to serve his sentence, Scott-Ford was released in July 1941 and stayed briefly with his mother. They quarrelled over his mother's use of the allowance from his Royal Navy pay which he sent home, with Scott-Ford accusing his mother of using it to buy a fur coat. Shortly afterwards he joined the Merchant Navy. He was on board the SS \"Finland\", which arrived in Lisbon on 10 May 1942.\n\nSoon after his arrival in Lisbon, he was met in a bar by a man who told him that his name was Rithman and that he could get a letter to the girl he had known in Dar-es-Salaam. Rithman offered Scott-Ford 1,000 Portuguese escudos if he would confirm the rumour that all British ships had been ordered to be in port on 28 June. Scott-Ford undertook to try to find out and to meet again the following day. Although unable to find confirmation, Scott-Ford met with Rithman and a man who called himself Captain Henley and appeared to be Rithman's superior. Confessing to not having supplied the information wanted, the group nevertheless discussed issues such as the state of morale in Britain, public opinion of Winston Churchill, and the extent of air raid damage. Henley gave him a 1,000-escudo note and arranged another meeting a few days later.\n\nAt this meeting, Scott-Ford was driven around in a car to disorient him and then taken to a room where he was asked to obtain more information about the location of British minefields, the arrival of American servicemen in Britain, and up-to-date copies of \"Jane's Fighting Ships\" and \"Jane's All the World's Aircraft\". Henley asked Scott-Ford to sign a receipt for the 1,000 escudos, which Scott-Ford did, using his real name. His ship sailed the next day; all the crew were interrogated on arrival at Liverpool to ask if they had been approached by German agents. Scott-Ford stated that he had been approached but had not cooperated.\n\nThe \"Finland\" sailed for Lisbon again in July, arriving on 26 July. Scott-Ford again met up with the Germans, receiving another 500 escudos for expenses (again signing a receipt) although he had been unable to get the books which they had requested. The Germans threatened to give the receipts to the British Embassy. Scott-Ford did give details of the convoy he had sailed in and its protection, the location of an aircraft factory, and the training of troops for an invasion of Europe. At the end of the meeting, he was told to keep a record of the movement and speed of the convoy and given another 100 escudos. Another meeting was arranged, but Scott-Ford was unable to keep it as the \"Finland\" sailed for Manchester.\n\nOn arriving at Salford Docks on 18 August, Scott-Ford was again routinely asked about approach attempts from German intelligence, and this time described a man who had asked him about communism in Britain. The authorities had already had word from Lisbon that an agent codenamed 'RUTHERFORD' by the Germans had been talking and therefore arranged to see him again the next day. Scott-Ford admitted that he had received 1,600 escudos (about £18 in 1942) for information. He was taken into custody and sent to the 'London Reception Centre', where refugees were routinely screened for German agents. The notes which Scott-Ford had made about the convoy were found in a search of his quarters on the \"Finland\".\n\nIn order to keep Scott-Ford in custody, an order was issued under Defence Regulation 18B for him to be detained. He was sent to Camp 020, an interrogation centre based at Latchmere House on Ham Common in southwest London where he complied with the authorities, although he became increasingly alarmed as he began to understand the seriousness of his situation. Professor A. W. B. Simpson, a historian of detention without trial, has speculated that Scott-Ford was offered his life in return for additional information on the Germans' intelligence system, but had no more to give. \n\nScott-Ford was charged under the Treachery Act 1940, and after an \"in camera\" trial before Mr Justice Birkett, was convicted on 16 October. The only sentence on conviction under the Treachery Act was death; it was the first occasion on which Birkett had found himself pronouncing a death sentence. Interviewed in 1959 by John Freeman on \"Face to Face\", Birkett said that he \"had always rather dreaded it, but when the actual moment came, I did it without the slightest trace of emotion\".\n\nCamp 020 were asked for their recommendation on whether Scott-Ford should be reprieved. The commandant wrote that there were no reasons for a reprieve: \"Indeed, there may well be many who will agree that death by hanging is almost too good for a sailor who will encompass the death of thousands of his shipmates without qualm.\" Scott-Ford was hanged by Albert Pierrepoint at 9.00am on 3 November 1942 at Wandsworth Prison. \n\nThe details of his trial had been kept secret until Scott-Ford was dead. The next day's papers reported that he had betrayed his country for £18, and lost his life in consequence, as a warning to other Merchant Navy sailors who might have been approached.\n\n"}

Whether or not she married Umar is a controversial topic between Sunnis and Shia. She is given the epithet 'the Younger' to distinguish her from her older sister, Zaynab the Elder (Zaynab al-Kubra).\nShe was born around 6 AH as the fourth child of Ali and of Muhammad's daughter, Fatimah. Her siblings were Hasan, Husayn and Zaynab al-Kubra. Muhammad gave her the kunya 'Umm Kulthum' because she closely resembled his daughter, Umm Kulthum bint Muhammad, Zaynab's maternal aunt.\n\nAli wanted his daughters to marry his brother Ja'far's sons, but Umm Kulthum's hand in marriage was requested by the Caliph, who promised, \"No man on the face of the earth will treat her better than I will.\"\n\nAli protested that she had not yet reached puberty, but Umar commanded that she be presented to him. Ali gave his daughter a striped garment and instructed her: \"Take this to the Commander of the Faithful and tell him: 'My father says, \"If you like this garment, keep it; if you don't like it, return it.\"'\" When Umm Kulthum brought this message to Umar, she reported, \"He did not undo the garment nor look at anything except at me.\" He told her that he was pleased, and so Ali consented to the marriage. Umar gave his bride a dower of 40,000 \"dirhams\", and the marriage was consummated in November or December 638 (Dhu'l-Qaada 17 AH).\n\nThey had two children, Zayd and Ruqayya. Ruqayya later married Ibrahim, a son of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, by whom she had a daughter.\nOne story from their married life tells how Umm Kulthum sent a gift of perfume to the Empress of Byzantium. The Empress sent back a \"superb\" necklace for Umm Kulthum. Umar believed that his wife should not have conducted a private correspondence at the expense of the state postal service, so he reimbursed her for the cost of the perfume and placed the Empress’s necklace in the state treasury. Nevertheless, it was said that Umar treated Umm Kulthum \"with extreme honour and respect\" because she was Muhammad's granddaughter.\n\nHowever, Shiites are of the view this marriage with Umar did not happen at all.\n\nAfter Umar's death in 644, Umm Kulthum married her young cousin, Ja'far's son Awn, for a dower of 4,000 \"dirhams\". Her brother Hasan remarked that he had never seen such passionate love as Umm Kulthum's for Awn. However, Awn died after only a short time.\n\nAfter Awn's death, Ali married Umm Kulthum to Awn's brother Muhammad, again for 4,000 \"dirhams\". But Muhammad also died.\n\nAfter the death of her husband Muhammad, Umm Kulthum became one of the wives of Awn and Muhammad's eldest brother, Abdullah, who had divorced her sister Zaynab \"al-Kubra\".. With respect to divorce the book of Muhammad Al-Munajjid discloses that Zaynab died while married to him (Abdullah bin Jafar). Umm Kulthum remarked: \"I was not shy with <nowiki>[my mother-in-law]</nowiki> Asma bint Umays. Two of her sons died while married to me, but I did not fear this for the third.\"\n\nUmm Kulthum had no children by any of her three latter marriages.\n\nShe is reported to have been present at the Battle of Karbala, during which her earings were taken from her by an attacking soldier. Afterwards, Umm Kulthum is said to have given a eulogy condemning the people of Kufa for abandoning her brother Husayn, who was killed in the battle.\n\nUmm Kulthum and her son Zayd died at the same time, in Abdullah's lifetime.

{"id": "2146808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146808", "title": "Zaynab bint Ali", "text": "Zaynab bint Ali\n\nZaynab bint Ali (, '), also spelled Zainab, was the daughter of Ali ibn Abi Talib and Fatimah bint Muhammad. The Islamic Prophet Muhammad was her maternal grandfather, and thus she is a member of his Ahl al-Bayt. She is often revered not only for her characteristics and actions, but also for her membership in, and continuation of, the biological line of Muhammad. Like other members of her family, she is considered to be a figure of sacrifice, strength, and piety in both the Sunni and Shia sects of Islam. \n\nZaynab married ‘Abdullah ibn Ja‘far and had four sons and one daughter with him. When her brother, Husayn, fought against Yazid ibn Mu‘awiyah in 680 CE (AH 61), Zaynab accompanied him. She played an important role in protecting her nephew, ‘Ali ibn Al-Husayn, and because of this, she became known as the \"Heroine of Karbala\". Zaynab died in 681 CE, and her mosque is located in Damascus, Syria.\n\nZaynab was the third child of Ali ibn Abi Talib and his wife Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad. She was born in Medina in AH 5 (AD 626) on 5 Jumada al-Awwal (3 August Julian calendar). \n\nLike her two elder brothers, Hasan and Husayn ibn Ali, Zaynab was named by Muhammad. The name \"Zaynab\" means \"the adornment of her father\". Three of ‘Ali's daughters were in fact named Zaynab, so sometimes this Zaynab was referred to as \"Zaynab the Elder\". In appearance she resembled both her father and her grandfather. \n\nFatimah died in 632 when Zaynab was six years old. As per her mother's request, Zaynab took on somewhat of a maternal role to her brothers. As a result, the siblings developed an especially close relationship.\n\nWhen Zaynab came of age, she was married to her first cousin ‘Abdullah ibn Ja'far, a nephew of ‘Ali, in a simple ceremony. Although Zaynab's husband was a man of means, the couple is said to have lived a modest life. Much of their wealth was devoted to charity. He maintained a reputation for liberality and patronage in Medina, earning him the nickname “the Ocean of Generosity” (Bahr al jud in Arabic).\n\nThe marriage of Zaynab did not diminish her strong attachment to her family. Ali felt a great affection for his daughter and son-in-law, so much so that in 37 AH (657/65/8) when he became caliph and moved the capital from Medina to Kufa, Zaynab and Abdullah moved with him. Zaynab bore four sons – ‘Ali, Aun, Muhammad, and Abbas – and one daughter, Umm Kulthum.\n\nSome sources suggest that Zaynab held sessions to help other women study the Quran and learn more about Islam. According to one of her biographies, \"The Victory of Truth\", she started this practice in Medina and later continued it when she moved with her father and family to Kufa.\n\nSometime after the death of the Muawiyah I, Husayn went to Kufa by the invitation of the people of Kufa for him to claim the leadership of the Muslim community. Zaynab accompanied him, as did most of his household. By the time Husayn's army arrived, the people of Kufa had changed their minds and betrayed and did not join Husayn's army at the Battle of Karbala.\n\nIn many ways, Zaynab functioned as a model of defiance against oppression and other forms of injustice. When her nephew, Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin, was sentenced to death by the governor of Kufah (Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad), she threw herself over him in a protective embrace yelling \"By God, I will not let go of him. If you are going to kill him, you will have to kill me along with him.\" Moved by Zaynab's action, the captors spared Zayn al-Abidin's life. Because Zayn al-Abidin was the only one of Husayn's sons to survive the Battle of Karbala, this courageous action was pivotal in preserving the survival of an important part of Ali genetic line and thus the future Imams in Shia Islam.\n\nZaynab and the other survivors of Husayn's army, most of them women and children, were marched to Damascus, Yazid's capital, where they were held captive. Tradition says that Zaynab, already in anguish due to the death of her brother Husayn and her sons Aun and Muhammad, was forced to march unveiled. This was an extreme indignity to inflict on a high-ranking Muslim woman, the granddaughter of Muhammad.\n\nWhile captive in Damascus, Zaynab held the first \"majlis\", or lamentation assembly in the palace of Yazid to mourn the loss of her beloved brother Husayn.\n\nAnother illustration of Zaynab's pious defiance was when a Syrian in Yazid's court demanded that he be given one of the younger captive girls, Fatimah bint Husayn.* Zaynab countered by suggesting that Syrian man was not worthy and did not have that type of authority. When Yazid claimed he had the authority to decide either way, Zaynab issued a scathing retort, answering “You, a commander who has authority, are vilifying unjustly and oppress with your authority.\"\n\nThis comment is representative of a larger sermon attributed to Zaynab in which she condemns Yazid and many of his actions, specifically focusing on his treatment of the household of Muhammad. The sermon is very eloquent and is reminiscent of the work in the Quran's exegesis, Zaynab did with other women in Medina and Kufa. The full text of this sermon is linked in the external links section below.\nEventually, Yazid released his captives and allowed them to return to Medina. On the way back, the party stopped once again at Karbala to mourn the loss of Husayn and the others that died there.\n\nAt the first day of Safar, according to a narration of Turabi, when they arrived at Damascus, they and the heads of fallen ones were taken into Yazid's presence. The identity of each head and killed persons were explained to him. Then he paid attention to an objecting woman. Yazid asked: \"Who is this arrogant woman?\" The woman rose to answer and said: \"Why are you asking them [the women]? Ask me. I will tell you. I am the granddaughter of Muhammad. I am the daughter of Fatimah.\" People at the court were impressed and amazed by her. At this time, Zaynab gave her \"khutbah\" (, sermon).\n\nAccording to the narration of Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid, in Yazid's presence, a man with red skin asked Yazid to give one of the captured women as a bondwoman.\n\nThe exact date and place of her death are not clear but it is probable that she died in the year 62 AH (681/682) some six months after her return to Medina. Some sources state that she died of illness during a journey with her family from Medina to Syria, at a location known as \"Zaynabia\". Others suggest she was assassinated by Yazid's soldiers while being extradited from Egypt.\n\nThe anniversary of her death is said to be either the 11th or 21st of Jumada al-Thani, the 24th of Safar, or the 16th of Dhu al-Hijjah. Some suggest that her grave can be found within Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque in Sayyidah Zaynab, Syria. Alternatively, many Sunnis believe her grave can be found within Al-Sayeda Zainab Mosque, a different mosque that is located in Cairo. The Fatimid/Dawoodi Bohra support the claim that Zaynab is buried in Cairo. Their 52nd Dai, Mohammed Burhanuddin, made \"zarih\" (a cage-like structure surrounding the tomb) for the shrine in Cairo. The Fatimids and some others believe that the Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque in Damascus is actually the burial site of one of her sisters, Umm Kulthum bint Ali (perhaps caused by confusion between \"Sugra\" and \"Kubra\"). There is some historical evidence suggesting Zaynab lived in Cairo near the end of her life.\n\nFrom the first days of the month of Muharram up to the tenth day of Ashura, during the mourning custom which includes sermons, reviewing narrations of the Battle of Karbala, not only the death of people who were killed in Karbala is commemorated but also the role of women in battle particularly Zaynab as \"transmitter of Husayn ibn Ali's message\" is done in Shia towns.\n\nThe ritual of majlis, or lamentation assembly mourning the deaths of the Prophetic line, is still practiced as an integral part of Shia Islam.\n\nAccording to Rawand Osman, during the Battle of Karbala Zaynab is introduced as a woman who stood against cruelty, so this role has been practiced by women in the Iranian Revolution and also in the Lebanon in the last three decades.\n\nIn Iran, her birthday is recognized as Nurse's Day because she nursed children such as Husayn's son Ali among others but also because of her taking care of those wounded in the Battle of Karbala.\nAs Rawand Osman mentioned, Zaynab's caring for Ali, who was among the survivors, shows the unusual role her she took on which went against traditional behavior. In addition to this, the author noted her devotional and political role.\n\n\n"}

The first national tallgrass prairie ever designated in the U.S. and the largest conservation site in the Chicago Wilderness region, it is located on the site of the former Joliet Army Ammunition Plant between the towns of Elwood, Manhattan and Wilmington in northeastern Illinois. Since 2015, it has hosted a conservation herd of American bison to study their interaction with prairie restoration and conservation.\n\nThe tallgrass prairie reserve is in the central forest-grasslands transition ecoregion of the temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands biome.\n\nMidewin remains the only federal tallgrass prairie preserve east of the Mississippi River, where surviving areas of that habitat are extremely rare. With the adjacent Des Plaines Fish and Wildlife Area and a number of other state and county protected areas in the immediate area, Midewin forms the heart of a conservation macrosite totaling more than 40,000 acres of protected land.\n\nThe pre-European settlement vegetation map of Midewin shows most of the site was prairie prior to the arrival of European settlers. The northwestern corner of the site along Jackson Creek was forest. Another small, forested area existed in the extreme southwest corner of Midewin along the Kankakee River and Prairie Creek.\n\nSeveral not-for-profit conservation organizations have played active roles in the restoration of high-quality tallgrass prairie, dolomite prairie, sedge meadows, swales and related communities at Midewin. These include the Wetlands Initiative, Openlands, and the Illinois chapter of The Nature Conservancy and several other members of the Chicago Wilderness collaborative.\n\nThe name \"Midewin\" (, ) is a Potowatomi Native American word referring to the tribe's healers, who it was believed also kept the tribal society in balance. Research since the establishment of the park has found evidence of a pre-European–contact village (c. 1600) from the Oneota culture in a place on the site called Middle Creek.\n\nThe Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie was established by federal law in 1996. Major proponents of the prairie establishment and restoration included World War II flying ace William J. Cullerton.\n\nThe Illinois Land Conservation Act (Public Law 104-106) created the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, designated the transfer of of land in Illinois from the U.S. Army to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service.\n\nThe Illinois Land Conservation Act mandates that Midewin be managed to meet four primary objectives:\n\nThe first land transfer from the Army to the Forest Service took place on March 10, 1997, and included of land that was believed to be free from contamination. Subsequent land acquisitions place the current size of Midewin at about .\n\nIn 2015, the prairie approved the use of 1,200 acres to establish a conservation herd of American Bison. The 20-year plan will study the relationship between the historic large grazing animal, which almost became extinct, and prairie restoration and health. In October, a herd of 27 bison were introduced. Four bulls were transferred from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Fort Collins, Colorado, and 23 cows were obtained from a ranch in Gann Valley, in Buffalo County, South Dakota. This is the first U.S. Forest Service project of its kind. By late spring 2017, births had increased the size of the herd to around 50.\n\nAfter a period of ecological restoration, part of the prairie opened to visitors in 2004.\n\nToday, over of the reserve are open, with public trails for non-motorized recreation. The MNTP headquarters entrance and visitors center is located on Illinois Route 53, near the center of the preserve.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2146832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146832", "title": "Cephas Thompson", "text": "Cephas Thompson\n\nCephas Thompson (July 1, 1775 – November 6, 1856) was a successful, largely self-taught, early nineteenth-century itinerant portrait painter in the United States. He was born, died, and lived most of his life in Middleborough, Massachusetts, but traveled extensively down the Atlantic coast and lived far from home for months at a time while pursuing his career as a portraitist.\n\nThompson married Olive Leonard on March 18, 1802 (his full-length portrait of her survives in the Metropolitan Museum of Art). Their son, Cephas Giovanni Thompson, became a painter of portraits and landscape in his own right, and a friend of the author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Cephas and Olive's daughter Florantha married missionary Granville Sproat and, after spending time teaching at La Pointe, Wisconsin, moved to California during the gold rush. Florantha and Granville's daughter Elvira (Cephas Thompson's granddaughter) married James Hutchings, an early promoter of Yosemite National Park.\n\nAlthough Thompson lived most of his life in Middleborough, he produced portraits at several locations in southeastern New England. From 1800 to 1825 he made many seasonal trips to the south to paint in Baltimore, Alexandria, Norfolk, Charleston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Georgia. Between 1805 and 1821 Thompson also paid five extended visits to Bristol, Rhode Island, where he painted over 132 portraits of merchants, ship-owners, sea captains, and their wives and children. Approximately 65% of Thompson's Bristol sitters derived wealth from their head-of-households' participation in the African-Caribbean-Carolina slave-trade. In April 1817 Thompson advertised his presence in Providence, Rhode Island, where he intended to paint portraits \"in the Hall of Blake's Hotel\". Thompson may well have painted portraits in Providence during this visit; but none has yet been identified. At about age 50, Thompson retired from itinerant painting to reside year-round on his Middleborough farm.\n\nAmong Cephas Thompson's portrait subjects are John Marshall, Stephen Decatur, David Ramsay of South Carolina, John Howard Payne, Elizabeth Wirt, James DeWolf, and George Washington Parke Custis, who was his pupil. As Deborah Sisum has noted and Keith Arbour has extensively documented, the most important patrons of Thompson's early career were members of the DeWolf family of Bristol, Rhode Island. The largest collection of Thompson's work is in the Boston Athenæum, which also holds some of the artist's papers. Portraits by Thompson are also in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum, Linden Place Museum, the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society Museum, and the Newport Historical Society. The amateur historian George Decas, devoted chapters 16 and 17 of his biography of Col. Peter Peirce to Cephas Thompson.\n\nLocal historian James Blachowicz has shown that from about 1788 to 1805 Cephas Thompson engraved over 50 slate gravestones near his Middleborough home. One of these stones, for Robert Strobredge (d. 1790) in the Thompson Hill cemetery in Lakeville is signed “Cephas Tomson, sculpt.” Blachowicz suggests that Thompson may have taken up this distinct art because of a kinship connection with Middleborough attorney and state senator Isaac Thompson (1746–1819), whose own relations included at least 8 gravestone carvers. Isaac Thompson was Cephas's uncle-by-marriage, that is, Cephas's mother Deborah's sister Lucy Sturtevant's husband.

It was released for the Xbox on October 7, 2002. A sequel, \"\", was released for the Xbox in 2004.\n\nNaoto Ohshima's inspiration for Blinx came from the fairy tale character Puss in Boots. When Ohshima first drew Blinx, the feline originally had purple fur.\n\nAdvertised as \"The World's First 4D Action Game\", \"Blinx: The Time Sweeper\" is a third-person platform game, in which the player controls the titular character Blinx, an anthropomorphic cat, who is on a mission to prevent the end of Dimension B1Q64 and rescue its princess from the evil Tom-Tom Gang. Blinx is outfitted with the TS-1000 Vacuum Cleaner, with which he can exert control over time itself through five unique \"Time Controls\": slowing time down, speeding time up, recording a moment in time, reversing time, and stopping it entirely.\n\nBlinx works as a Time Sweeper at the Time Factory, a facility located outside of time itself that's dedicated to the creation, distribution and maintenance of the flow of time throughout the dimensions. Whenever Time Glitches are found in any part of a dimension, Time Sweepers like Blinx are dispatched to whatever dimension the glitches are in to locate and correct them before they solidify into Time Crystals. If left unchecked, the crystals will transform into Time Monsters, which will roam freely among whatever dimension they're in, disrupting time and distorting whatever they come into contact with. But, when the Tom-Tom Gang, a malevolent army of pigs, begin to steal and destroy countless Time Crystals in a dimension known by the codename \"B1Q64\", it becomes unstable to the extent that the Time Sweepers decide, for the safety of all other dimensions, to halt the supply of time to it, suspending it and its inhabitants indefinitely. But when Blinx spots Princess Lena, the monarch of Dimension B1Q64, being held hostage by the Tom-Tom Gang, he enters the dimension via the Time Sweepers' Time Portal moments before it closes to rescue her.\n\nGameSpy suggests that Blinx was proposed as a possible mascot for the Xbox system, rivaling Nintendo's Mario, Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog, and Sony's Crash Bandicoot (which later became a property of Activision), and since the main character of \"\" (Master Chief) was considered too violent (and also lacking in identity behind a visor), and the officials wanted a \"friendly, furry face\" to lead the sales among the younger clientele. Due to the game's unpopularity, it never achieved the suggested goal and Master Chief is unofficially seen as the mascot, though Blinx was in fact proposed as the mascot for the Xbox in Japan for a while.\n\nWhile already available via backwards compatibility on the Xbox 360, on April 10 2018, it was announced by Microsoft, backwards compatibility would be supported for \"Blinx: The Time Sweeper\" on Xbox One on April 17 2018. Physical discs will be playable on the system, while available on the Xbox Live Store as a digital download.\n\n\"Blinx\" was met with a mildly positive reception upon release, as GameRankings gave it a score of 73.09%, while Metacritic gave it 71 out of 100. GameSpy included the game in its \"Most Overrated Games Ever\" feature. Although the graphics were generally praised, the game's execution, notably the control method, was considered to have resulted in the game being too difficult. Saleswise, by 2003, 156,000 copies were sold. In 2003, \"Blinx\" also entered the Platinum Hits range (as part of the all-age Platinum Family Hits).\n\nGameSpot editor Greg Kasavin gave it a score of 6.3 out of 10, noting that players get a sense of relief from completing a level, rather than enjoyment or satisfaction. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave it 7.5/5.5/8: the second reviewer found the game to be tedious and repetitive, but the third believed that \"issues aside, the unique style and play mechanics make [it] stand out\". In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 31 out of 40.\n\n"}

Communities located nearby are Moccasin and La Grange. It is the sixth-largest reservoir in California.\nAlso referenced as Don Pedro Lake when the name is qualified, the first projects in 1923 are generally referred to as the Old Don Pedro Dam and reservoir, and the 1971 upgrades are the New Don Pedro Dam and reservoir. Don Pedro Reservoir takes its name from Don Pedros Bar. Pierre (\"Don Pedro\") Sainsevain was one of the first prospectors after the discovery of gold in 1848 that began the California Gold Rush.\n\nWhen full, the reservoir's shoreline is approximately . The reservoir submerges some of Tuolumne River bed, and has a surface area of about . The stored here comes from a watershed of over , and is used by the Modesto Irrigation District (MID) and the Turlock Irrigation District (TID) for the irrigation of several hundred square miles of San Joaquin Valley farm land.\n\nSome of the water is treated by the MID and used as drinking water in Modesto. The two irrigation districts and the BLM control the land above the high lake level.\n\nThe Don Pedro Recreation Area is operated in and around the lake by the Don Pedro Lake Recreation Agency. There are drive-in and boat-in campgrounds, houseboat areas, fishing, water skiing, and mountain biking and hiking trails.\n\nThere are three public boat ramps on the shoreline, in the Blue Oaks Area, Moccasin Point Area, and Fleming Meadows Area.\n\nWhile Don Pedro Reservoir is not part of the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, the project's tunnels cross under the upper end of the reservoir. The reservoir could easily be tied into the Hetch Hetchy Project in the future, and the efforts of the Restore Hetch Hetchy group to drain the reservoir in the Hetch Hetchy Valley depend largely on that possibility. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC), of which Hetch Hetchy Water and Power is a division, provided about 45% of the funds for construction of the 1971 New Don Pedro Dam and so has the right to store of water in the reservoir.

The rights of the MID and the TID are senior to those of SFPUC, however, so in dry years MID and TID can draw down the reservoir to meet their own needs before providing water to San Francisco's Hetch Hetchy Water and Power.\n\n\n"}

The intent is that when expressed in new variables, the problem may become simpler, or equivalent to a better understood problem.\n\nChange of variables is an operation that is related to substitution. However these are different operations, as can be seen when considering differentiation (chain rule) or integration (integration by substitution).\n\nA very simple example of a useful variable change can be seen in the problem of finding the roots of the sixth degree polynomial:\n\nSixth degree polynomial equations are generally impossible to solve in terms of radicals (see Abel–Ruffini theorem). This particular equation, however, may be written \n(this is a simple case of a polynomial decomposition). Thus the equation may be\nsimplified by defining a new variable \"u\" =\"x\". Substituting \"x\" by formula_3 into the polynomial gives\n\nwhich is just a quadratic equation with the two solutions:\n\nThe solutions in terms of the original variable are obtained by substituting \"x\" back in for \"u\", which gives\n\nThen, assuming that one is interested only in real solutions, the solutions of the original equation are\n\nConsider the system of equations\n\nwhere formula_10 and formula_11 are positive integers with formula_12. (Source: 1991 AIME)\n\nSolving this normally is not very difficult, but it may get a little tedious. However, we can rewrite the second equation as formula_13. Making the substitution formula_14 reduces the system to formula_15 Solving this gives formula_16 or formula_17 Back-substituting the first ordered pair gives us formula_18, which gives the solution formula_19 Back-substituting the second ordered pair gives us formula_20, which gives no solutions. Hence the solution that solves the system is formula_21.\n\nLet formula_22, formula_23 be smooth manifolds and let formula_24 be a formula_25-diffeomorphism between them, that is: formula_26 is a formula_27 times continuously differentiable, bijective map from formula_22 to formula_23 with formula_27 times continuously differentiable inverse from formula_23 to formula_22. Here formula_27 may be any natural number (or zero), formula_34 (smooth) or formula_35 (analytic).\n\nThe map formula_26 is called a \"regular coordinate transformation\" or \"regular variable substitution\", where \"regular\" refers to the formula_25-ness of formula_26. Usually one will write formula_39 to indicate the replacement of the variable formula_10 by the variable formula_11 by substituting the value of formula_26 in formula_11 for every occurrence of formula_10.\n\nSome systems can be more easily solved when switching to polar coordinates. Consider for example the equation\n\nThis may be a potential energy function for some physical problem. If one does not immediately see a solution, one might try the substitution\n\nNote that if formula_48 runs outside a formula_49-length interval, for example, formula_50, the map formula_26 is no longer bijective. Therefore, formula_26 should be limited to, for example formula_53. Notice how formula_54 is excluded, for formula_26 is not bijective in the origin (formula_48 can take any value, the point will be mapped to (0, 0)). Then, replacing all occurrences of the original variables by the new expressions prescribed by formula_26 and using the identity formula_58, we get\n\nNow the solutions can be readily found: formula_60, so formula_61 or formula_62. Applying the inverse of formula_26 shows that this is equivalent to formula_64 while formula_65. Indeed, we see that for formula_64 the function vanishes, except for the origin.\n\nNote that, had we allowed formula_54, the origin would also have been a solution, though it is not a solution to the original problem. Here the bijectivity of formula_26 is crucial. The function is always positive (for formula_69), hence the absolute values.\n\nThe chain rule is used to simplify complicated differentiation. For example, consider the problem of calculating the derivative\n\nWriting\n\nwe get\n\nDifficult integrals may often be evaluated by changing variables; this is enabled by the substitution rule and is analogous to the use of the chain rule above. Difficult integrals may also be solved by simplifying the integral using a change of variables given by the corresponding Jacobian matrix and determinant. Using the Jacobian determinant and the corresponding change of variable that it gives is the basis of coordinate systems such as polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems.\n\nVariable changes for differentiation and integration are taught in elementary calculus and the steps are rarely carried out in full.\n\nThe very broad use of variable changes is apparent when considering differential equations, where the independent variables may be changed using the chain rule or the dependent variables are changed resulting in some differentiation to be carried out. Exotic changes, such as the mingling of dependent and independent variables in point and contact transformations, can be very complicated but allow much freedom.\n\nVery often, a general form for a change is substituted into a problem and parameters picked along the way to best simplify the problem.\n\nProbably the simplest change is the scaling and shifting of variables, that is replacing them with new variables that are \"stretched\" and \"moved\" by constant amounts. This is very common in practical applications to get physical parameters out of problems. For an \"n\" order derivative, the change simply results in\n\nwhere\n\nThis may be shown readily through the chain rule and linearity of differentiation. This change is very common in practical applications to get physical parameters out of problems, for example, the boundary value problem\n\ndescribes parallel fluid flow between flat solid walls separated by a distance δ; μ is the viscosity and formula_77 the pressure gradient, both constants. By scaling the variables the problem becomes\n\nwhere\n\nScaling is useful for many reasons. It simplifies analysis both by reducing the number of parameters and by simply making the problem neater. Proper scaling may \"normalize\" variables, that is make them have a sensible unitless range such as 0 to 1. Finally, if a problem mandates numeric solution, the fewer the parameters the fewer the number of computations.\n\nConsider a system of equations\n\nfor a given function formula_81.\nThe mass can be eliminated by the (trivial) substitution formula_82.\nClearly this is a bijective map from formula_83 to formula_83. Under the substitution formula_85 the system becomes\n\nGiven a force field formula_87, Newton's equations of motion are\nLagrange examined how these equations of motion change under an arbitrary substitution of variables formula_89, formula_90\n\nHe found that the equations\nare equivalent to Newton's equations for the function formula_92,\nwhere \"T\" is the kinetic, and \"V\" the potential energy.\n\nIn fact, when the substitution is chosen well (exploiting for example symmetries and constraints of the system) these equations are much easier to solve than Newton's equations in Cartesian coordinates.\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Conservative representative from 1932 to 1945.\n\nKetchen was born to a Scottish family living in Sholopore, India. His father, Major James Ketchen, served in the Indian Army. The younger Ketchen was educated at Wellington College and Royal Military College, Sandhurst, England, and was commissioned into the British Army as a second-lieutenant in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, but resigned after a couple of years. He came to Canada in 1894, serving for a time with the North-West Mounted Police. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Ketchen volunteered for service with Lord Strathcona's Corps, a privately funded unit of Canadian soldiers, and was commissioned a lieutenant on 17 March 1900 as the corps embarked for South Africa. He later saw active service in World War I, commanding the Sixth Canadian Infantry Brigade in France from 1915 to 1918.\n\nKetchen was nearly dismissed after being used as a scapegoat for following orders from the British. The Battle of St-Eloi in April 1916. After British troops had taken a large crater near the ruins of the Belgian town of St Eloi, his brigade was ordered to hold the gain against German counter-attacks. Due to dreadful mismanagement of the Canadian forces by Ketchen and his divisional commander Richard Turner, German soldiers overran the crater, causing 1,400 Canadian casualties and retaking the land around the crater, negating the gains made at heavy cost just a few days before. General Sir Herbert Plumer, the commander of the Second Army who wasresponsible for the front, demanded Ketchen's immediate dismissal. When Turner claimed that if Ketchen was dismissed he would resign, the commander of the Canadian Corps, Lieutenant-General Alderson, sought Turner's dismissal as well. Both officers were supporters of Militia Minister Sir Sam Hughes, who made it clear in no uncertain terms to Commander in Chief, Sir Douglas Haig, that if Turner went then Haig could no longer rely on Canadian support. This led to the diplomatic compromise of Alderson being relieved of his command and replaced by Julian Byng, while Turner and Ketchen retained their commands.\n\nKetchen reached the rank of Major-General in the Canadian Army and retired on pension in 1929. From 1920 to 1923, he served as president of the Canadian Legion in Manitoba and was also president of the South Winnipeg Conservative Association. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1932 provincial election for the constituency of Winnipeg, which elected ten members by a single transferable ballot. Ketchen finished seventh on the first ballot, and was declared elected. Running for re-election in the 1936 election, he finished eighth on the first ballot and was declared elected on the sixteenth count. The Conservative Party was the primary opposition party in Manitoba during this period, and Ketchen sat with his party caucus on the opposition benches. In 1940, the Conservative Party joined with the Liberal-Progressive Party and other parties in a coalition government. Ketchen initially sat as a government backbencher, but soon became disillusioned with the coalition arrangement. In the 1941 provincial election, he ran as a dissident Conservative opposing the coalition. He finished sixth on the first count, and was again declared elected on the sixteenth. The coalition supporters won 50 of 55 seats in the legislature in the 1941 election. Ketchen appears to have served as Leader of the Opposition in the legislature from 1941 to 1943. The Conservative Party remained a part of the coalition throughout the 1940s. Ketchen did not run for re-election in 1945. He died in hospital in Winnipeg at the age of 87.\n\nHe married, in 1905, Margaret Elizabeth Robinson.\n"}

A 3.1 km trail runs from the park entrance up to the crater rim, and continues in a 7.2 km loop encircling the crater. The whole tour (gate-around the rim-gate) of 13.5 km takes about 4–5 hours allowing for necessary rest breaks - parts of the trail are heavily eroded and very steep. The gate elevation is around 2150 m and the peak at 2780 m but following the jagged rim involves substantially more than the 630 m vertical difference.\n\nA forest of small trees covers the crater floor, and small steam vents are found spaced around the walls of the crater. The mountain is home to various species of wildlife, notably plains zebra, giraffe, Thomson's gazelle, buffaloes and hartebeest.\n\nMount Longonot is 60 kilometres northwest of Nairobi and may be reached from there by a tarmac road.

The current summit cone was developed within the earlier caldera. This cone itself is capped by a 1.8 km crater. The Mountain has several parasitic cones and effusive lava eruptions occur on the flanks and within the caldera floor. Periodic geodetic activity recorded at Longonot in 2004–2006 demonstrated the presence of active magmatic systems beneath this volcano.\n\n, geothermal projects struggle to explore the potential.\n\nOn March 21, 2009 Bush Fires burned up the side of the mountain and descended into the crater, trapping wildlife and feeding on drought ravaged brush.\n\n\n"}

He was the oldest of the seven siblings who could sing, as the two oldest brothers, Virl and Tom, are hearing impaired. During much of the Osmonds' career, Alan, being the oldest of the group, was the band's behind-the-scenes leader, playing piano and guitar, co-writing many of their songs, co-producing most of their recordings and arranging the dance choreography (he nevertheless seldom sang anything more than backing vocals, in contrast to his younger brothers). He mostly stopped performing with the group after 2007, and what he has professed to be his final performance with them was October 13, 2018 at Neal Blaisdell Arena in Honolulu.\n\nFour of the Osmonds (Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay) were cast over a seven-year period on NBC's \"The Andy Williams Show\". They also appeared in nine episodes of the 1963-1964 ABC western television series, \"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters\", with Alan in the role of young Micah Kissel. The series starred then 12-year-old Kurt Russell on a wagon train headed to the American West.\n\nAfter a brief courtship with singer Karen Carpenter, Osmond married Suzanne Pinegar on July 16, 1974. He and Suzanne have eight sons, who perform as the Osmond Brothers Second Generation: Michael Alan (1975); Nathan George (1977); Douglas Kenneth (1978); David Levi (1979); Scott Merrill (1981); Jonathon Pinegar (1983); Alexander Thomas (1988); and Tyler James (1990). Alan, like all the Osmonds, is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; seven of his sons have served LDS missions, while the youngest son Tyler did not serve.\n\nIn 1987, Osmond was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disease which damages the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. His son, David Osmond, lead singer of the group Osmonds 2nd Generation, who was also diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2005, participated in the eighth season of \"American Idol\" on January 28, 2009 with a pass to Hollywood. However, due to laryngitis, he was not able to make it past Hollywood week. David also substitutes for his uncle Donny in stage shows with his aunt Marie, and his song \"We Are One\" was used as the theme song to the \"Glenn Beck Radio Program\" from 2016 to 2017.\n\nIn 2000, Alan Osmond received the Dorothy Corwin Spirit of Life Award from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. In his acceptance speech, he stated that he had done some time in the military reserve and that he had taken karate lessons from Chuck Norris, both of which reinforced the \"you can do it\" attitude that he learned from his father. His motto is, \"I may have MS, but MS does NOT have me!\" He currently runs the OneHeart Foundation and also works as a motivational speaker.\n\nAlan enlisted in the California Army National Guard in the late 1960’s. He served at Fort Ord in northern California as a 144th artillery unit clerk.\n\n"}
{"id": "2146898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146898", "title": "Sankethi dialect", "text": "Sankethi dialect\n\nSankethi (sometimes spelled Sanketi) is a South Dravidian language that is closely related to Tamil. It is sometimes considered a dialect of Kannada or Tamil, but there are considerable differences that make it unintelligible to speakers of both languages. It has strong lexical influences from Kannada (particularly in the colloquial language), as well as Sanskrit, Tamil and Tulu. It is most commonly spoken in Karnataka, India by the Sankethi people, who migrated from Sengottai in Tamilnadu.\n\nThe language is most often written in the Kannada script, though it could be written in Tamil as well. However, Sankethi (especially in the spoken form) has relatively higher frequencies of consonant clusters of more than two consonants and semivowels. This makes it difficult to write in the Kannada script, which would require multiple subscripted letters (ಒತ್ತಕ್ಷರ - ottakṣara). As a result, Sankethi is rarely found in printed or any written form, and has no standardized form. Three main dialects exist of the Sankethi language: Kaushika, Bettadpura and Lingadahalli, each associated with the three primary Sankethi communities located in Karnataka.\n\nSankethi phonology is very similar to Kannada and Tamil, with the classical Sanskrit aspirates and retroflex laterals characteristic of many Dravidian languages. Like a few other South Indian languages including Konkani, Marathi, and Saurashtra, the language has a few uncommon aspirates: [], [nʰ], and [ʃʰ], though both most often appear in their palatalized forms. Its presence is usually marked by the presence of long vowels, as well as syllable finally (where they are often palatalized in that position). See the table below for the range of Sankethi consonants.\n\nSankethi vowels are very similar to Tamil vowels:\n\nIn Sankethi, some nouns that end in ಒ (o) have a final nasal sound, which is not indicated with the anusvāra when written down. This is especially prevalent in the Lingadahalli dialect.\n\nBelow is a table comparing some basic words in Sankethi, Kannada, and Tamil. \nOne peculiar feature of Sankethi is its use of words and structures of both Sanskrit and Dravidian origin to form new words. A study by H.S. Ananthanarayana details a number of noun formation strategies in Sankethi.\n\n-ಮಯು - \"full of\" (ex. ಪೂವಮಯು - full of flowers)\n\nNouns \n\nSankethi grammar is fairly similar to those of most other Dravidian languages, with six cases: nominative (unmarked), accusative, instrumental-ablative, dative, genitive, and locative. The vocative is not fully functional case, and not all nouns have a separate form for it, and as such is not included in the traditional list. \n\nLike Tamil, there is clusivity distinction: ನಾಂಗ (nānga; exclusive) VS ನಾಂಬು (nāmbu/ inclusive), though the frequency usage varies. A good example of its usage is the Sankethi endonym for the language: ಎಂಗಡೆ ವಾರ್ಥೆ (eṃgaḍe vārthe), which implies that the language belongs to the speaker and the Sankethi community, so as to distinguish it from a shared language. \n\nBelow is a table of pronouns: \n\nPolite versions of \"he\" and \"she\" are ಇವ್ಹು/ಅವ್ಹು (ivhu/avhu) and ಇವ್ಹೆ/ಅವ್ಹೆ (ivhe/avhe). However, these are increasingly rare and replaced by ಇವ್ಹಾ/ಅವ್ಹಾ (ivhā/avhā), perhaps as an influence from Kannada. ತಾಂಗ is usually found only in religious contexts, and even then, \"nīnga\" is often preferred. ತಾಂಗ and \"ನೀಂಗ\" have the same inflections and verb conjugations. The use of ಇವ್ಹ್ಯ/ಅವ್ಹ್ಯ is increasingly rare, since the word was historically used to refer to people outside the Sankethi community. Eventually it acquired a more general, pejorative meaning of “those people (outsiders)”, and as such is rarely used. \n\nCase Declension\n\nThe declensional classes are similar to Kannada, marked by animate versus inanimate and weak (ಇ, ಈ, ಎ, ಏ, ಐ) versus strong vowel (ಅ, ಆ, ಉ, ಊ, ಒ, ಓ, ಔ, ಋ) endings. Gender only exists for human nouns, and is only relevant in the third person verb conjugations. Generally, the verb classes are delineated as 1st (animate strong vowel ending), 2nd (inanimate strong vowel ending), 3rd (animate weak vowel ending), and 4th (inanimate weak vowel ending).\n\nThough Sankethi vocabulary is not systematized, there are some general rules for taking nouns from Sanskrit, Tamil, Kannada, or Malayalam. \n\n\nSee the table below for case declensions. The nominative is the base form of a given noun, and as such is not included in the table below.\n\nVerbs\n\nVerbs in Sankethi have two kinds of verbs stems. There are verbs that end in ಉ/ಒ (u/o) and ಇ/ಎ (i/e). Generally speaking, they undergo the following changes during conjugation\n\n\nBelow are tables that show different tenses, given for the verb ಸಾಪಡು (to eat/drink):\n\n\"Non-Past Simple\"\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>In all tenses, the ನೀ form's final -್ಯ (-ya) becomes -ಎಯ (-eya) as a question, and the ನೀಂಗ form changes from -್ಯೊ (-yo) to -ಿಳ (-iḷa) as a question.\n\n\"Non-Past/Present Perfect\"\n\n\"Past\"\n\nThe past tense in Sankethi is complex due to stem rules inherited from Tamil. The past tense is also notable in that the ನೀಂಗ (nīnga) form is where Sankethi's uncommon aspirates are most visible. There a number of different kinds of past tense endings associated with certain verb endings. There are also a number of irregular verbs, with no necessarily discernible pattern.\n\nಪಣ್ಣು - -ಉ ending verbs\n\nಉಡು - -ಡು ending verbs without an stressed penultimate syllable (change to -ಟ್ಟ-)\n\nಸಾಪಡು - -ಡು ending verbs with an unstressed penultimate syllable\n\nಪಾರು \"-\" stressed long vowel as the penultimate syllable (change the final syllable to -ತು)\n\nಇಳಿ - -ಇ ending verbs\n\nಉಳು (uḷu to fall) (also ಅಳಿ, ನಡಿ)\n\nThis is a special pattern unique to ನಿಲ್ಲಿ (nilli) and -ಕ್ಯೊ (-kyo) ending verbs (ex. ತುಂಕ್ಯೊ - tuṃkyo)\n\nThe following verbs are irregular:\n\nಕುಡು (to give)\n\nಪುಡಿ (to carry)\n\nಚಿರಿ\"/\"ಉರಿ (to smile/peel) (add -ಚ- before adding endings)\n\nತೋಯಿ (to wash)\n\nವಯ್ಯಿ (to scold)\n\nಇರು (to be)\n\nವರು (to come)\n\nಪೋಹು (to go)\n\nಆಹು (to happen/become)\n\n\"Past Perfect/Past Progressive or Remote Past\"\n\nThe past progressive and past perfect in Sankethi are the same, and their meaning is distinguished only by context. For this reason, the conjugations below may be referred to jointly as the remote past.\n\n\"Future\"\n\nThis is a hypothetical construction for the future tense in Sankethi, though it functions more like a hypothetical (\"Shall I...?\"). C.T. Dathathreya reconstructs this set of conjugations by referring to Tamil and Kannada conjugations for the future tense. In a literary or poetic context, it would likely imply the future tense, and when appearing as an instruction, it has the jussive meaning of \"must do\" or the passive meaning \"will be done\". Dathathreya refers to this as the \"future indefinite\", suggesting a distant (hence very hypothetical) circumstance.\n\n\"Negation\"\n\nNegation is indicated by suffixing the appropriate ending, and similar to Kannada, there are separate forms for each tense. Again, the example verb is ಸಾಪಡು (sāpaḍu). Some Sankethi speakers negate with the ending -ಅಲ್ಲೆ (alle) and others with -ಅಲ್ಲ (alla). It varies with the generation of the speakers and their proximity to Tamil or Kannada communities. The negative future is a hypothetical construction based on C.T. Dathathreya's reconstruction.\n\nPresent: ಸಾಪಡಲ್ಲ (sāpaḍalla)\n\nPresent Progressive: ಸಾಪಡರಾಂಡಿಕ್ಕಲ್ಲ (sāpaḍarāṃḍikkalla)\n\nPast/Present Perfect: ಸಾಪಡಿಕ್ಕಲ್ಲ (sāpaḍikkalla)\n\nPast Progressive: ಸಾಪಡಾನ್ನಿಂದಲ್ಲ (sāpaḍānnindalla)\n\nFuture: ಸಪಡವಿಲ್ಲ (sāpaḍavilla)\n\n\"Imperative\"\n\n\"Prohibitive\"\n\n"}

Abortion is becoming a factor for disagreement and lawsuit between partners.\n\nRoman law allowed induced abortions but regulated it in consideration of the biological father. Emperor Septimius Severus ruled circa 211 AD that a woman who had an abortion without consent from her husband should face exile for having bereaved her husband of children.\n\nIn his speech \"Pro Cluentio\", delivered in 66 BC, Cicero refers to a case he had heard of in which a woman from Miletus was sentenced to death for having aborted her pregnancy, upon receiving bribes from those who stood to inherit her husband's estate if he produced no heir. Cicero said that in doing so she had \"destroyed the hope of the father, the memory of his name, the supply of his race, the heir of his family, a citizen intended for the use of the republic\".\n\nA 4th century BC Greek writer from Alexandria, Egypt, Sopater, quoted the lawyer Lysias, who had referred to a trial in Athens in which a man named Antigene accused his wife of having deprived him of a son by having an abortion.\n\nWhether a male has a legal right to advance his personal interest, whether it be toward abortion, fatherhood, or adoption, over that of the female, differs by region.\n\nIn 2011, it was reported that Indonesia, Malawi, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Equatorial Guinea, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Taiwan and Turkey all had laws which required that an abortion first be authorized by the woman's husband. However, in some countries, this stipulation could be bypassed or overridden if there is genuine concern for maternal health.\n\nSince \"Roe v. Wade\", some states in the United States have attempted to enact laws requiring spousal consent. All of these laws have been ruled unconstitutional, spousal consent in the 1976 decision \"Planned Parenthood v. Danforth\" and spousal awareness in the 1992 decision \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\n\nIn China the husband of a woman who had an abortion filed a lawsuit against her in 2002 under a law intended to grant sexual equality in terms of childbearing and contraceptive decisions. The law stated that a woman has no overriding priority over her spouse in deciding whether to have a child.\n\nA number of legal cases have arisen in the Western world in which men have tried to prevent women with whom they had been sexually active from obtaining an abortion, all of which failed:\n\n\nAbout men deciding to decline parenthood in the event of an unintended pregnancy and asking for a financial abortion:\n\n\nThose who support a man's right to intervene in a woman's reproductive decisions, argue that it is unreasonable that, after fertilisation has occurred, women are often given more options with regard to pregnancy and parenthood than men. Armin Brott has said of this, \"A woman can legally deprive a man of his right to become a parent or force him to become one against his will\".\n\nMen's rights and fathers' rights activists have argued that men should have veto power over their partners' decisions to abort. Similarly, philosopher George W. Harris has written that, if a man impregnates a woman with the explicit goal of having a child, in a manner that is mutually consensual, then it would be morally unacceptable for that woman to later have an abortion.\n\nThose who object to men having a right to direct involvement argue that because it is the woman's body carrying the unborn baby, her determination for or against abortion should be the only one. Marsha Garrison, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, stated that U.S. courts acknowledge \"that embryo is in the woman's body, it is within her and can't be separated from her, so it's not just her decision-making about whether to bear a child, it's about her body\".\n\nA 2002 United States Gallup special report mentions only 38% of the population being opposed to notifying the husband of a married woman for an abortion. In a 2003 Gallup poll, 72% of respondents were in favor of notification to the husband, with 26% opposed; of those polled, 79% of males and 67% of females responded in favor of notification inside married couples.\n\nBioethicist Jacob Appel has asked, “if one grants a man veto power over a woman’s choice to have an abortion in cases where he is willing to pay for the child, why not grant him the right to demand an abortion where he is unwilling to provide for the child?\"\n\nIn reference to cases in which men who do not desire to become fathers have been expected by the mother to pay child support, Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, in her 1998 article, \"The Male Abortion: The Putative Father's Right to Terminate His Interests in and Obligations to the Unborn Child,\" set forth the theory of the \"male abortion,\" in which she argues that men should be able to terminate their legal obligations to unwanted children.\n\nIt is also possible, rather than taking the stance that males should have the freedom to opt out of inherent responsibilities and rights, to take the stance that one must opt-in and agree to undertake those responsibilities to be compelled to follow them, and only through doing so, earn parental rights. This is what occurs during adoption.\n\n"}

The railway's trackage, the piers, and the generating station are owned by Nova Scotia Power, a subsidiary of Emera Inc.\n\nThe railway line was completed in 1895 by the Dominion Coal Company (DOMCO) between Sydney and Louisbourg. The trackage was organized as the Sydney and Louisburg Railway (S&L) in 1910.\n\nThe S&L, along with other assets of the corporate successor to DOMCO, Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO), were expropriated by the Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO) on March 30, 1968. DEVCO operated the railway as an unincorporated department of its Coal Division, however it was informally known as the Devco Railway. DEVCO built a coal preparation and coal wash plant and storage facility, along with new locomotive shops at Victoria Junction, a location midway between Sydney and the Lingan Generating Station near New Waterford.\n\nOn November 23, 2001, DEVCO closed its last underground coal mine, the Prince colliery, after the company failed to entice any private sector investors to purchase the mine. DEVCO was out of the coal mining business, however for a period of approximately 1 month, it was in the coal importation business, with trains operating from the international coaling piers to the storage facility and on to the Lingan Generating Station.\n\nThe federal government moved swiftly to sell off assets, transferring the mine properties and mineral rights back to the provincial Department of Natural Resources. DEVCO subsequently decommissioned the Victoria Junction coal wash plant and began to immediately prepare remediation of the mine sites.\n\nOn December 18, 2001 DEVCO sold all surface assets, including the international shipping piers, railway track, railway rights-of-way, locomotives and rolling stock, and a coal storage facility and locomotive shops at Victoria Junction to 510845 New Brunswick Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Emera, the holding company which owns Nova Scotia Power and operator of the Lingan Generating Station.\n\nEmera subsequently contracted the operation of its newly acquired DEVCO surface assets to Logistec Corporation. Logistec sub-contracted operation of the railway to the Société des chemins de fer du Québec (Quebec Railway Corporation), a Quebec-based railway holding company and short-line operating company. The new railway was called Sydney Coal Railway, although ownership of the track and other assets remains with Emera's subsidiary, 510845 New Brunswick Inc.\n\nDespite SCR having been created by SCFQ as an operating company in December 2001, the railway itself was actually legally chartered to 510845 N.B. Inc. until January 1, 2003, when the Sydney Coal Railway was formally recognized by the federal government.\n\nOn 3 November 2008 Logistec announced that it was purchasing the SCR from Quebec Railway Corporation.\n\nCurrent SCR operations consist of running coal imports which arrive at the international coaling piers on Sydney Harbour by bulk carrier from the United States and South America. Coal is unloaded from ships and stored at the pier, and is then loaded onto trains and delivered directly to the Lingan Generating Station. Typical trains consist of a pair of ex-DEVCO GMD GP38-2 locomotives and 21 ex-DEVCO Ortner 5 bay rapid discharge hopper cars. \n\nThe shop facility at Victoria Junction is still in use, but the wash plant and storage facilities are no longer used. SCR also maintains an interchange connection with the North American railway network at Sydney where it connects to the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway, with the latter operator possessing a connection with Canadian National at Truro; however, this connection is currently threatened as CBNS has discontinued service on the line from Sydney to St. Peter's Junction (near Port Hawkesbury), and will apply to abandon the line April 1, 2016.\n"}

In 1989, during the final week of the regular season, Michigan head coach Bill Frieder agreed to take the coaching job at Arizona State University beginning the next season. Frieder intended to coach Michigan through the end of the 1989 NCAA tournament. However, when he told athletic director Bo Schembechler of his intentions, Schembechler ordered Frieder to leave immediately and named Fisher as interim head coach. When announcing the promotion of Fisher, Schembechler famously said, \"I don't want someone from Arizona State coaching the Michigan team. A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan.\"\n\nInitially, Fisher was not expected to retain the position after the season. However, Fisher led the Wolverines to an improbable NCAA championship that season, thanks to a strong performance by forward Glen Rice. Schembechler hired him as the school's permanent head coach a week after the championship game. Michigan credits the 1988–89 regular season to Frieder and the NCAA tournament to Fisher. Because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the timing of Fisher's hiring, he is the only person to win the NCAA Men's Division I national championship without having ever experienced a loss as the team's head coach.\n\nThe next two seasons of the Fisher era were struggles. However, in 1991, Fisher signed one of the most talented incoming freshman classes of all time. High school stars Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Ray Jackson, Jimmy King, and Juwan Howard all signed with Fisher and Michigan, forming what became known as the \"Fab Five\". Together, they helped lead the Wolverines to the national title game in their freshman year, only to lose to Duke. As sophomores, they again reached the title game, this time losing to North Carolina. In that game, Webber was called for a technical foul with 11 seconds remaining in the game when he signaled for a timeout when the Wolverines had none left.\n\nAfter the title-game loss to the Tar Heels, Webber went pro; Rose and Howard followed after an elite eight loss to the eventual National Champion Arkansas Razorbacks. The Wolverines would not reach the same heights until 2013, although they reached the postseason each of the next five seasons and won the 1997 National Invitation Tournament.\n\nIn October 1997, Michigan fired Fisher as a result of an off-court scandal (\"see section below\").\n\nFisher was out of coaching for the 1997–98 season before taking a job as an assistant with the Sacramento Kings.\n\nIn 1999, Fisher took over as coach of a San Diego State program that had suffered losing records in 13 of the previous 14 years. In the season before he arrived, the Aztecs had won just four games, but within two seasons Fisher had brought the team up to a .500 record, and led them to a 21–12 record and an NCAA Tournament appearance in year three of his regime. He has since led them to seven other NCAA tourneys, and five appearances in the National Invitation Tournament.\n\nIn 1997, after it was revealed that Maurice Taylor had visited Ed Martin, a retired Ford electrician, the school launched an investigation. After the investigators questioned Fisher's role in arranging complimentary tickets for Martin, Fisher was fired a week before practice began for the 1997–98 season.\n\nLater, additional facts surfaced that further damaged the program's reputation. In 2002, an indictment unsealed in a Detroit federal court charged Ed Martin with running an illegal gambling operation and money laundering. Additionally, it claimed that Martin gave Webber $280,000 in illicit loans while Webber was in high school and college, with another $336,000 allegedly going to three other former Wolverine players – Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock. Martin ultimately pleaded guilty, but died in February 2003.\n\nAs a result of the revelations, Michigan imposed its own sanctions on the basketball program in 2002, vacating its two Final Four games from the 1992 NCAA Tournament and its standing as the tournament's runner-up. It also vacated the entire 1992–93 season, as well as every game from 1995–96 to 1998–99. Michigan also withdrew from postseason consideration for the 2002–03 season, and removed the banners hanging in Crisler Arena that commemorated their post-season appearances and removed references to the named players' records. The move came because the payments may have compromised the four players' amateur status. The NCAA accepted Michigan's sanctions, and additionally placed the school on probation until 2006. It also ordered Michigan to disassociate itself from the four players until 2013.\n\nThe discoveries did not impact Fisher's career with San Diego State (and no new allegations have occurred in conjunction with that program). Fisher denied any knowledge of the Martin misconduct. The NCAA ultimately faulted Fisher for allowing Martin access to his players (though his ties to Michigan dated to the Frieder era), but otherwise cleared him of wrongdoing.\n\nIn 1999, Fisher took over the basketball program at San Diego State University. The Aztecs had not been to the postseason since their NCAA appearance in 1984–1985.\n\nIn his third year, Fisher led the Aztecs to their first Mountain West Conference tournament title, and finished with a 21–12 record and continued the upward surge of the program. They returned to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since that same '84–85 team. During the 2002–2003 season (his fourth year), Steve Fisher's Aztecs returned to the post-season when they hosted an NIT First round match against UCSB. The Aztecs earned their first ever Division 1 post-season win. After two rebuilding seasons (2003–2004 and 2004–2005), the Aztecs returned to the NCAA Tournament in the 2005–2006 season; Steve Fisher's seventh season. That year the Aztecs began a present 10-year streak of consecutive 20+ win seasons while capturing their first ever Mountain West Conference Regular Season Championship, and winning their second ever Mountain West Conference Tournament Championship.\n\nIn 2009, the Aztecs earned a school-record 26 victories and reached the semifinals of the NIT. It was their third consecutive trip to the NIT, and fourth consecutive post-season appearance. In the 2009–2010 season, the Aztecs won another 20+ games, won the Mountain West Conference Tournament, and earned their third NCAA Tournament trip under Fisher. In 2010–2011, the Aztecs, ranked #25 in the pre-season AP poll and were ranked #4 late in the season, the highest ranking in school history. SDSU even received three first place votes in the Coaches' Poll at one point. They spent nearly the entire season in the top 10 and won their first NCAA Tournament game ever en route to the Sweet 16. SDSU set a school record in the 2010–11 season with 34 wins. They had 3 total losses, the first 2 against Sweet 16 team BYU (who they went on to beat in MWC Tournament Championship game) and their 3rd loss was to future NCAA Tournament winner UConn.\n\nOverall Fisher has guided SDSU to the NCAA Tournament in 2002, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 and the postseason NIT in 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2016 to go along with twelve 20-win seasons (eleven consecutive from 2005–present). Additionally, under Fisher, the Aztecs have won or shared six MWC regular season titles (2006 outright, 2011 shared with BYU, 2012 shared with New Mexico, 2014 outright, 2015 shared with Boise State, 2016 outright), and won four MWC tournaments (2002, 2006, 2010, 2011). Since the 2005–2006 season, Steve Fisher has led the Aztecs to eleven consecutive post-season appearances, including six consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances—the first time the Aztecs have done this as a Division I team.\n\nJust ten head coaches have won the NIT as well as the NCAA tournaments. The others are Nat Holman (who did it in the same year), John Calipari, Vadal Peterson, Nolan Richardson, Bobby Knight, Adolph Rupp, Joe B. Hall, Al McGuire, Dean Smith, and Jim Calhoun.\n\nSteve Fisher won his 300th game as Head Coach of the San Diego State Aztecs Men's Basketball Program on January 31, 2014 in a game against Colorado State University. \n\"It's not me, it's we…\", remarked Coach Fisher.\n\nOn October 29, 2015, SDSU dedicated the basketball court at Viejas Arena to Steve Fisher, naming it Steve Fisher Court.\n\nOn April 10, 2017, Fisher reportedly informed San Diego State University of his intent to retire, which was followed by a formal announcement the following day that confirmed his retirement.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>\"Fisher served as interim coach during the 1989 NCAA tournament after Bill Frieder resigned.

It is the fifth and final Bloody Roar game as well as the second game in the series to appear on the PlayStation 2 and the only game in the series to have received an M rating by ESRB due to the blood effects.\n\nLike the previous games in the series, characters can transform into beasts during battle, using the beast gauge, slightly increasing their power. Unlike the other games, however, the beast gauge acts as its own separate health meter.\n\nAfter the events of \"Bloody Roar 3\", Xion, who is possessed by the Unborn, an evil spirit, attacks the dragon temple, awakening the dragon. The dragon is a weapon of Gaia, the Earth's will, and is supposed to awaken in the presence of evil. However, if freed too long, it can inadvertently destroy the world itself. The dragon is successfully resealed by the temple's head miko at the cost of her life, leaving the late miko's sister, Mana, to watch over the seal in Ryoho, the temple's priest and the vessel of the dragon. Other than attacking the temple, Xion also stabs a woman named Nagi, imbuing her with his power as well as that of Gaia's, making her both his lifesaver and enemy.\n\nA year later, the dragon is about to break free again, causing disturbances among the zoanthropes triggering earthquakes. Each of the zoanthropes investigate and eventually find the source in the dragon temple. In some cases, Ryoho and Mana invite them to help strengthen the seal, while others come on their own accord. In most of the characters' endings, Mana manages to seal the dragon and Ryoho comes out alive. In Nagi's ending, in addition to sealing the dragon and saving Ryoho, she kills Xion and the Unborn.

He was a member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1929 to 1931, representing the electorate of Martin for the Australian Labor Party (1929-1931) and the splinter Lang Labor party (1931).\n\nEldridge was born in Kolkata, India. He educated at the Cootamundra, Marrickville and Fort Street schools in New South Wales and studied economics at the University of Sydney and social sciences and administration at the University of London. He became a public servant, and was assistant superintendent of the State Labour Bureau for many years; he also served as secretary of the British Empire League in Australia. Eldridge enlisted for service in World War I as a gunner in 1916, but was not deployed overseas until June 1918. Among his later public service roles was Executive Secretary of the New South Wales Commission for the British Empire Exhibition and Secretary of the New South Wales Commission for the New Zealand Exhibition; during the mid-1920s, he was an officer with the state Department of Labour and Industry. He founded the Social Science Service of Australia, was president of the New South Wales Pedestrians Association and patron of the League of New South Wales Wheelmen, and was a member of the Returned Soldiers' Association. An active member of the Labor Party, Eldridge wrote articles for Labor journals across a range of subjects, was an unsuccessful candidate for the Senate at the 1925 federal election and directed the party's radio campaign at the 1929 election.\n\nHe was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1929 federal election, when he unexpectedly won the seat of Martin amidst Labor's large victory that year. Eldridge was a prominent supporter of Premier of New South Wales Jack Lang and his \"Lang Plan\" for responding to the Great Depression, and was heavily involved in the bitter divisions leading to the Lang section of the 1931 Labor split. As the split progressed, he was seen as the Lang Labor federal deputy leader under Jack Beasley. Given that Martin was thought to be unwinnable for a second term, Eldridge sought to contest Barton, held by official Labor incumbent James Tully at the forthcoming federal election. On 25 November 1931, Eldridge moved for the vote that, when Eldridge and his Lang colleagues voted with the opposition, brought down the Scullin Labor government. Both Eldridge and Tully lost to a United Australia Party candidate at the resulting 1931 election.\n\nHe was a Commonwealth Arbitration Inspector from August 1940. Eldridge also made a series of unsuccessful attempts to re-enter politics over many years: he contested the state seat of Croydon at the 1932 state election for Lang's State Labor Party, recontested Barton for Lang Labor in 1934, and following Lang Labor's collapse unsuccessfully sought Labor preselection in his old seat of Martin in 1942 and for the Senate in 1945.\n\nHe died in 1954 at his daughter's residence in Rockdale, aged 82.\n"}

She is known for having married three companions of the Prophet: Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, Abu Bakr and Ali ibn Abi Talib.\n\nShe was apparently born in Mecca as the daughter of immigrants. Her father was Umays ibn Ma'ad from the Khath'am tribe, and her mother was Hind bint Awf from the Himyar tribe.\n\nHer full siblings were Salma bint Umais, wife of Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib, and Awn ibn Umais. Her maternal half-siblings included two of Muhammad's wives, Zaynab bint Khuzayma and Maymuna bint al-Harith, as well as Lubaba bint al-Harith, the wife of Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib, Al-Sa'ib ibn al-Harith, Qatn ibn al-Harith and the community treasurer Mahmiyah ibn Al-Jaz'.\n\nAsma and her sister Salma both converted to Islam \"after the Messenger of Allah had entered the house of al-Arqam\", i.e., between late 614 and early 616. She is notable for having been the wife of three of Muhammad's close companions.\n\nHer first husband was Ja'far ibn Abu Talib from the Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. In 616 she emigrated with him to Abyssinia, where she gave birth to three sons, Abdullah, Muhammad and Awn. Asma disliked Abyssinia and she later referred to \"fear\" and \"harm\" that she had suffered there while \"far away and banished,\" though she did not enlarge on the nature of these difficulties.\n\nThey returned to Medina in 628 at the time of the Muslim conquest of Khaybar.\n\nJa'far fought at the Battle of Mu'tah against Byzantium in September 629 and, along with Zayd ibn Harithah and `Abd Allah ibn Rawahah, was killed there.\n\nAsma narrated how she heard the news of her husband's death. \"The Prophet came to me. I had prepared forty \"mann\" of 'dip' [tanned forty skins] and kneaded the dough. I took my two sons and I washed their faces and put oil on them. The Messenger of God came to me and said, 'O Asma, where are the sons of Ja'far?' I brought them to him and he embraced them and smelt them, then his eyes welled up and he cried. I said, 'Why, Messenger of God, perhaps [you have news] about Ja'far.' He replied, 'Yes, he was killed today.' I stood up and screamed, and the women came to me. The Prophet began to say, 'O Asma, do not speak obscene words or beat your chest!'\" Her son Abdullah remembered: \"He said, 'O Asma, will you not rejoice? Indeed, God most high has made two wings for Ja'far, that he may fly with them in Paradise!'\" Then Muhammad told his daughter Fatimah, \"Prepare food for the family of Ja'far, for they are preoccupied today.\"\n\nAfter Ja'far's death Asma married Abu Bakr. She gave birth to his son Muhammad in 632 at al-Baydaa while on the way to The Farewell Pilgrimage. Abu Bakr planned to send Asma and their child back to Medina, but Muhammad told him to let her make the major ablution and then rededicate herself in offering the pilgrimage.\n\nThe dying Abu Bakr left instructions that Asma should wash his corpse and that she should not fast on that day. She only remembered this instruction towards sunset, when she called for water to drink so that she would not have technically disobeyed him. As it was a very cold day, it was agreed that she did not have to perform an ablution after washing the body.\n\nWhen Abu Bakr died, Umar allotted Asma a pension of 1,000 \"dirhams\".\nSoon afterwards, however, she married Ali, the brother of her first husband Ja'far, who brought up Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr as his own son. Asma bore Yahya and Awn to Ali.\n\nOne tradition tells of a squabble that broke out between Muhammad ibn Ja'far and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, each of them boasting that his own father had been better. Ali told Asma to settle the quarrel. She told the boys: \"Ja'far was the best young Arab, and Abu Bakr was the best old Arab.\" Ali said: \"That's a good answer. But you haven't said anything about me!\" Asma replied, \"Of the three, you are the least to choose.\"\n\nIt is believed that Asma's \"qabr\" (, grave) is at the \"Maqbarah al-Bāb aṣ-Ṣaghīr\" (, Cemetery of Bab as-Saghir) in Damascus, present-day Syria.\n\nAsma narrated \"ahadith\" from Muhammad. According to a report deemed authentic, she is considered one of the women of Paradise.\n\nThe following historians state that Asma was present at Fatima's wedding ceremony in 1 AH:\n\nThey depend on the narrations of: Abu Abbas Khawarazmi from Husayn ibn Ali, Sayid Jalal al-Din Abu al-Hamid Ibn Fakhr al-Musawi, and Dulabi from Imam Baqir and his father. This is a historical problem that has not yet been solved despite the various attempts made by Majlisi in \"Bihar al-Anwar\" vol. 10. It is also narrated that she was present during the marriage of Aisha.\n\nOne theory states that Asma Bint Umais had actually immigrated with her husband to Abyssinia, but repeatedly returned to Mecca and Medina. The distance between Jeddah and Abyssinia is limited to that of the width of the Red Sea, which is not very difficult for a journey. One narration makes a mention of Ja'far supporting this stance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2147002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147002", "title": "Francis Frith", "text": "Francis Frith\n\nFrancis Frith (also spelled Frances Frith, 7 October 1822 – 25 February 1898) was an English photographer of the Middle East and many towns in the United Kingdom.\n\nFrith was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, attending Quaker schools at Ackworth and Quaker Camp Hill in Birmingham (ca. 1828–1838), before he started in the cutlery business. He suffered a nervous breakdown in 1843, recuperating over the next two years. In 1850 he started a photographic studio in Liverpool, known as Frith & Hayward. A successful grocer, and later, printer, Frith fostered an interest in photography, becoming a founding member of the Liverpool Photographic Society in 1853. Frith sold his companies in 1855 in order to dedicate himself entirely to photography. He journeyed to the Middle East on three occasions, the first of which was a trip to Egypt in 1856 with very large cameras (16\" x 20\"). He used the collodion process, a major technical achievement in hot and dusty conditions.\n\nFrancis Frith Jr was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the second child and only son of Francis Frith Sr and his wife Alice, née Walker. He was born into a merchant Quaker family. He was originally apprenticed in the cutlery trade, but eventually became a grocer, supplying ships at Liverpool. He appears to have learned photography sometime in the 1850s, and in 1859 was one of the founding members of the Liverpool Photographic Society. \n\nFrith was one of the first of a new type of entrepreneurial photographer to establish himself as a retailer of scenic photographs on a large scale. During his travels he noted that tourists were the main consumers of the views of Italy, but armchair travellers bought scenes from other parts of the world in the hope of obtaining a true record, \"far beyond anything that is in the power of the most accomplished artist to transfer to his canvas.\" These words express the ambitious goal that Frith set for himself when he departed on his first trip to the Nile Valley in 1856 with his inventive friend Francis H. Wenham, who acted as lighting technician. \n\nHe also made two other trips before 1860, extending his photo-taking to Palestine and Syria. In addition to photography, he also kept a journal during his travels elaborating on the difficulties of the trip, commenting on the \"smothering little tent\" and the collodion fizzing - boiling up over the glass. Frith also noticed the compositional problems regarding the point of view from the camera. According to Frith, \"the difficulty of getting a view satisfactorily in the camera: foregrounds are especially perverse; distance too near or too far; the falling away of the ground; the intervention of some brick wall or other common object... Oh what pictures we would make if we could command our point of views.\" An image he took known as the \"Approach to Philae\" is just one example which elaborates his ability to find refreshing photographic solutions to these problems. (cited from \"A World History of Photography\")\n\nWhen not taking photographs in the Middle East, he was back in England, printing them and reproducing them in delightful illustrated books - including his \"Egypt and Palestine photographed described by Francis Frithm 1858-60\" and \"Egypt, Palestine and Sinai\" (1860) with text by Mrs Sophia Poole and Reginald Stuart Poole - both of which became very popular.\n\nWhen he had finished his travels in the Middle East in 1859, he opened the firm of Francis Frith & Co. in Reigate, Surrey, as the world's first specialist photographic publisher. In 1860, he married Mary Ann Rosling (sister of Alfred Rosling, the first treasurer of the Photographic Society) and embarked upon a colossal project—to photograph every town and village in the United Kingdom; in particular, notable historical or interesting sights. Initially he took the photographs himself, but as success came, he hired people to help him and set about establishing his postcard company, a firm that became one of the largest photographic studios in the world. Within a few years, over two thousand shops throughout the United Kingdom were selling his postcards.\nMany of his photographs were collected into published volumes. Initially these works were compiled by established publishing companies. However, by the 1860s, Firth realised that he could profit from publishing his own images and established the publishing company F. Frith & Co. \n\nSelect list of publications\n\nFrith was \"recorded\" as a Quaker minister in 1872 (at this time there only some 250 recorded ministers in England and Wales). He served on numerous committees, and frequently spoke in favour of pacifism and abstinence. He was an occasional contributor of philosophical and religious articles and poems to the Quaker journal, the \"Friends' Quarterly Examiner\".\n\nIn his sixties, Frith positioned himself at the extreme liberal wing of society. In 1884, he published (with William Pollard and William Turner) \"A Reasonable Faith\", a highly controversial pamphlet which challenged evangelical orthodoxy by questioning the factuality of the Bible. Although the liberal views expressed in \"A Reasonable Faith\" were quickly and vociferously attacked by leading evangelical Quakers, liberal theology rapidly gained support and within ten years became the majority view. Thus it was Francis Frith and his co-authors who began the liberalisation of the Quaker movement and paved the way for the philanthropic and educational reforms for which the movement is well known today.\n\nFrith married Mary Ann Rosling, and they had five children: Mary Alice, Eustace, Francis Edgar, Mabel and Cyril.\n\nFrith died at his villa in Cannes, France, on 25 February 1898, aged 75.\n\nHis family continued the firm, which was finally closed in 1971. Following closure of the business, Bill Jay, one of Britain's first photography historians, identified the archive as being nationally important, and \"at risk\". Jay managed to persuade McCann-Erikson the London advertising agency to approach their client Rothmans of Pall Mall on 14 December 1971 to purchase the archive to ensure its safety. Rothmans went ahead and acquired the archive within weeks.\n\nFrith was re-launched in 1975 as \"The Francis Frith Collection\" by John Buck, a Rothmans executive, with the intention of making the Frith photographs available to as wide an audience as possible.\n\nOn 25 August 1977, Buck bought the archive from Rothmans, and has run it as an independent business since that time – trading as The Francis Frith Collection. In 2016 the company completed a two-year project to scan the entire archive and now holds over 330,000 high resolution digital images. The company website enables visitors to browse all 330,000 Frith photographs, depicting some 7,000 cities, towns and villages.\n\nThe ten-part BBC series \"Britain's First Photo Album\", presented by John Sergeant, was first shown on BBC2 in March 2012 and takes a look at the history of Francis Frith's pioneering photographic work.\n\nA 320-page book also entitled \"Britain's First Photo Album\" has been published.\n\n\n- Rasch, Carsten: The photographic works of Francis Frith - Photographs of Egypt and the Holy Land, Hamburg 2014. \n"}

{"id": "2147009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147009", "title": "Sports and recreation in Bermuda", "text": "Sports and recreation in Bermuda\n\nA variety of sports are played in Bermuda, from those brought by British and International relations (namely Cricket, football, rugby football, and tennis), to those popularised nationally (such as sailing). Some sports and events have greater historical and cultural significance whilst others are played for entertainment or competition.\n\nMany sports popular today were formalised by British public schools and universities in the Nineteenth Century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the British empire, and team sports were a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as The Football Association (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players in 1885. They soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. The armed forces encouraged competitive and team sports for all ranks for the same reasons public schools did. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military personnel quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including cricket, football, Rugby football, golf, and even tennis and rowing (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic, and the officers soon switched to sail racing, founding the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.\n\nIn Bermuda, cricket and football (soccer) are the most popular sports. Cricket in particular now has a two-day (not including the weekend) holiday dedicated to it, called Cup Match. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark \"forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery\". The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the St. George's Garrison (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the Royal Naval Dockyard at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian). The whole of Bermuda ground to a complete halt for two days every summer to turn its attention to this cricket game. Venues of the game change yearly between both clubs. The popularity of the annual game was such that it caused continued absences from employment. As a direct result, the 2-day public holiday was first introduced in 1947 and has been in effect ever since. The two days (currently called Emancipation Day and Somers Day) feature a single Cricket match between teams from both ends of the island, a match has been played for over a century. The Island's national Cricket team has also competed internationally.\n\nFootball did not become popular with Bermudians 'til after the Second World War, though teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army Bermuda Garrison, and Royal Air Force units of Bermuda had competed annually for the Governor's Cup introduced by Major-General Sir George Mackworth Bullock in 1913. Although most of its members had never played football before joining the army, a combined team of the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA) and the Bermuda Militia Infantry (BMI) defeated to win the cup on 21 March, 1943, becoming the first team of a locally raised unit to do so, and the third British Army team to do so since 1926.\n\nBermuda holds the most golf courses per square mile in the world. The golf courses on the island are quite distinct as they are generally short, and their turf hard and sandy. The wind is also higher as unblocked gusts from the sea-facing side of a course can sometimes affect the accuracy of a golf swing. Bermuda's hilly terrain is apparent at some of the island's golf courses. Bermuda holds number of golf tournaments and events annually held by the Bermuda Golf Association. One of the most popular annual tournaments is the Bermuda Open. Bermudian Quinn Talbot, who lost an arm in a motorcycle crash in 1969, was both the United States National Amputee Golf Champion for five successive years and the British World One-Arm Golf Champion.\n\nBermuda being an island with a history of sailing and a number of sailing clubs, it is no surprise that sailing has been historically a popular sport. Namely, dinghy racing is seen as the main competitive sport. Unsurprisingly, most Bermudians swim, and Bermudians compete in swimming competitions in the Caribbean. Bermudians also enjoy non-competitive sports like diving and fishing. In 2017, Bermuda hosted the America's Cup being the 35th staging of the America's Cup yacht race. The challenger, Emirates Team New Zealand, won by a score of 7 to 1 over the defender, Oracle Team USA. It was held on the Great Sound in Bermuda from June 17 to June 26. The sporting event brought a major increase in jobs and tourism to the island.\n\nSquash has seen a surge in popularity since the squash world championships were held on the island in 2017. Additionally, junior squash has flourished on the island with many junior Bermudian squash players applying their trade overseas in top squash organisations. At the Caribbean Area Squash Championships, Bermuda tends to place well fending off countries such as Jamaica and Guyana that are many times the countries respective population size.\n\nIn Bermuda, Basketball is played competitively nationally and internationally. At the Caribbean Basketball Championship Bermuda beat countries with many times its population size. The country has access to multiple basketball facilities.\n\nGenerally, Bermudians match poorly in international competition due to their small population size, and mostly compete in individual events in international competition\nBermuda is often represented in the Olympic Games, though it has only won a single medal (in boxing). Bermuda also participates in the Americas' Cup Sailing Competitions with some success.\n\nOther popular sports include various equestrian forms including pony-cart racing and dressage, Futsal, rugby, squash and tennis. See rugby union in Bermuda. Motorsports are gaining in popularity, particularly after the construction of Bermuda Motorsports Park. Australian rules football is also gaining popularity and the island will host the Australian Rules Football Championships in April 2007, an international tournament featuring sides from Canada, the United States, Europe and the Bermuda Lions national team.\nBermuda Fitted Dinghy racing – in which a number of small punts outfitted with huge sails and a crew of six race each other and frequently sink – has been declining in popularity over the years.\nLacrosse grew in popularity on the island, but is now declining in popularity. In 2006 Bermuda was represented at the ILF world championships of lacrosse in Ontario, Canada. Bermuda is an affiliate nation of the International Lacrosse Federation.\nCompetitive Netball has grown popular within schools.\n\n"}

It is a sequel to \"\" and the second game in the \"Fatal Fury\" franchise. Its updated version, \"Fatal Fury Special\", was released in 1993.\n\n\"Fatal Fury 2\" was the second game in SNK's 100-Mega Shock series, offering improved graphics and gameplay over the original \"\". The play controls were modified, this time making full use of the Neo-Geo's four button configuration, by including four attack buttons (Light Punch, Light Kick, Strong Punch, and Strong Kick). The player can also dash back from the opponent to retreat by quickly tapping the lever backwards twice.\n\nThe two-plane battle system from the first \"Fatal Fury\" has been retained. This time, the player can move freely to the adjacent plane by pressing the Light Punch and Light Kick buttons simultaneously for the \"Plane Move\". The player can also perform a \"Power Attack\" that will knock the opponent to the other plane. When the opponent is on the other plane, the player can press either a punch button to jump towards the opponent with a \"Low Plane Move Attack\" or either a kick button for a \"High Plane Move Attack\". Certain stages have hazards in the background plane, such as electrified wires or a stampede of bulls, and thus the player cannot change planes but can knock the opponent to the other plane to cause extra damage.\n\nOther specialized techniques have been added as well. After the player guards an opponent's attack, they can follow it up with a special counterattack technique known as an \"Evasion Attack\". The player can also taunt the opponent by pressing the Strong Punch button from a distance. \"Fatal Fury 2\" also introduces the \"Desperation Move\" (or \"Fury\"), a powerful type of Special Move which causes massive damage that can only be used when the player's life gauge is at 25% and flashing red.\n\nThe single-player mode has the player facing against all eight characters (including a clone of the player's character), followed by four non-playable boss characters. After every fourth match, the player will participate in a bonus round for more points.\n\nAfter Geese Howard's death in the original \"Fatal Fury\", a mysterious nobleman becomes the sponsor of the new \"King of Fighters\" tournament. This time, the tournament is held worldwide with fighters around the globe competing. As the single-player mode progresses, the mysterious challenger begins defeating the participants from the first \"Fatal Fury\" game, searching for the man responsible for defeating Geese.\n\nThe character roster consists of eight selectable warriors: Terry, Andy and Joe from the original \"Fatal Fury\", plus five new playable newcomers. After defeating all eight playable characters in the single player tournament (including a clone of the player's character), the player faces four non-playable bosses.\n\nPlayable fighters:\n\nBosses:\n\nIn addition to the Neo-Geo AES and Neo-Geo CD home versions, a port of \"Fatal Fury 2\" was released for the Sharp X68000 in Japan in 1993, followed by versions for the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive, PC Engine CD, SNES and Game Boy in early 1994. The SNES and Genesis versions were published by Takara, while the X68000 version, released only in Japan, was published by Mahou Kabushikigaisha (Magical Company). All three versions allow the player to control the four boss characters via their own respective codes. The PC Engine version was published by Hudson Soft only in Japan and was one of the first games to require the Arcade Card add-on. To coincide with the Japanese release of the SNES version, Hori Electric released a special controller called the Fatal Fury 2 Commander which has the power and super power moves of all the game's playable characters programmed in so that they can be triggered with a single button.\n\nThe original Neo Geo version of the game was later included in 2006's \"Fatal Fury: Battle Archive Volume 1\" for the PlayStation 2 (with a choice between the original AES and CD soundtrack).

It is an updated version of \"Fatal Fury 2\", introducing several changes to the gameplay system while expanding the available character roster.\n\n\"Fatal Fury 2\" was generally very well received by Western game critics upon its release. \"GamePro\" review of the Neo Geo version praised the \"action-packed\" gameplay, \"\"Street Fighter\"-tough\" challenge, \"great\" character graphics and animation, \"slick scrolling\" backgrounds, and \"fantastic\" sound, concluding it to be an \"awesome sequel\" that \"ranks up there with the Numero Uno fighting game.\"\n\n\"GamePro\" also praised the Genesis version for its six-button controller support and character graphics. They regarded the music as dull but assessed that the game \"faithfully mimics the Neo Geo version and knocks \"Fatal Fury\" Genesis out of the ring.\" Reviewing the Genesis version, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" (\"EGM\") criticized the sound effects but gave the overall assessment that \"all the fighters, all the stages, and extra options not in the arcade (like a speed setting) make this another fine conversion of a Neo Geo title.\"\n\nReviewing the SNES version of the game, \"EGM\" called it \"one of the better fighting games ported to the SNES\" and awarded it Game of the Month. \"GamePro\" gave the SNES version a more mixed review, comparing it favorably with its predecessor, but stating that the graphics are inferior to the Neo Geo version, the audio is terrible, the controls are unreliable, and the gameplay is unbalanced. The magazine recommended that \"Fatal Fury\" fans instead hold out for the upcoming SNES port of \"Fatal Fury Special\", which they felt to be far superior judging by the pre-release version they had seen.\n\nIn a retrospective review, \"Maximum\" assessed that while still not as strong as \"Street Fighter II\", \"Fatal Fury 2\" was a dramatic improvement over the first game: \"the number of characters selectable had been extended to eight, and all of them received a full complement of moves and fought with a much greater fluidity than in \"Fatal Fury\".\" They also noted better background graphics and greater interaction with the scenery.

The number of Line Move Attacks have also increased; pressing the Light Punch or Light Kick button while the opponent is on an opposite line will perform a Low Line Jump Attack.\n\nThe single-player mode has the player fighting all of the playable characters, beginning with the eight regular characters from the previous game, as well as Tung and Duck, with the player given a choice in their first opponent.

It was later ported to Nintendo Switch on July 2017 by a Japanese game publisher HAMSTER.\n\nReviewing the Neo Geo version, \"GamePro\" praised the variety of characters, the addition of new moves for the older characters, the combos, the detailed graphics, and the humorous touches to the backgrounds, though they felt the ability to jump between the foreground and background tended to be an annoyance. All four reviewers for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" (\"EGM\") referred to it as \"one of the best tournament fighting games out there\" (with insignificant changes in wording between each reviewer). They praised the new characters, the improved backgrounds and animations, and the music, and gave it a score of 34 out of 40 (average 8.5 out of 10).\n\n\"GamePro\" gave the Game Gear version a rave review, stating that though it has fewer characters and vastly inferior graphics and sounds compared to the Neo Geo version, it \"is arguably the best handheld fighting game ever released\" due to the responsive action and the inclusion of \"extra elements you never thought you'd see in a handheld fighter\". The magazine particularly applauded the presence of a combo system and the numerous special moves.\n\nOn release, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored the Mega-CD version of the game a 21 out of 40. \"GamePro\" declared it \"yet another Neo Geo arcade game that's been poorly converted for a home system.\" Although they complimented the inclusion of all the characters, moves, and music of the arcade version, they felt that the removal of key animation frames and distinctive background elements would make the conversion a major disappointment to anyone used to the arcade game. The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" instead judged it to be an overall solid conversion, remarking that the sound effects are weak and garbled, but the music, play controls, and graphics all replicate the original with reasonable accuracy. They scored it 29.5 out of 40 (an average of 7.375 out of 10).\n\nAll four reviewers of \"EGM\" complained of the severe echo effect in the audio of the SNES version, and two of them said that some of the moves are hard to pull off. However, they commented that the graphics, while a step down from the Neo Geo version, are still relatively sharp, and judged it an overall good conversion. They scored it 29.5 out of 40 (an average of 7.375 out of 10). \"GamePro\" was less pleased with the conversion, and remarked that the graphics and controls are vastly inferior to those of the Neo Geo version. They also criticized the special moves which are activated when a character is near death as a \"cheesy way of evening things out between players of varying skill levels.\" A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" also gave it a negative review, though almost solely for its perceived lack of originality, commenting that \"sprite-based 2D fighting games are a dime a dozen, and in spite of the impressive Dolby Surround, all this one really has going it is sheer size: 15 characters ... and five special moves apiece, some of which are slick, but none of which you haven't pulled off it some other game of its ilk.\"\n\nJeff Gerstmann of GameSpot gave the Xbox Live Arcade release a 6.5 out of 10. He remarked that the game is emulated well, and approved of the fact that it emulates the Neo Geo home version rather than the arcade version. He stated that the game itself is good compared to other Neo Geo fighters of its time, but would probably not appeal to modern players who are not already familiar with the \"Fatal Fury\" franchise. In a 1996 retrospective review, \"Maximum\" commented that \"Fatal Fury Special\" \"tweaked the gameplay of \"Fatal Fury 2\" overly very superficially, and the main selling point lay with the number of combatants.\" However, they praised the more hectic pace of the game, and gave it 3 out of 5 stars. \n\n\n\n\n"}

She served as the president of the Iowa Equal Suffrage Association in 1913. She headed the Roadside Settlement House in Des Moines, Iowa. Dunlap was the first woman to ever serve on the Board of Education of Des Moines. She was a friend of Jane Addams and a supporter of the Women's Suffrage Movement.\n\nDunlap was born in 1872 to Mary and Samuel W. Dunlap. Growing up in Circleville, Ohio, she attended school in nearby Columbus. She graduated from Cincinnati Wesleyan College.\n\nDunlap earned an apprenticeship at the Kingsley Settlement House a year later. Following the apprenticeship, Dunlap went on to live in the Goodrich House in Cleveland, as well as the Hull House in Chicago. Dunlap found the widespread fame of the Hull House to be “…a stimulating, an absorbing, and a bewildering place in which to live and work.” However, she wished to work in a smaller city rather than staying in Chicago despite her love for Hull House. After Dunlap resigned her position at the Roadside Settlement House in September 1916, she headed the Neighborhood Guild House in Brooklyn, New York. Dunlap ultimately returned to the Roadside Settlement in 1918, where she maintained head resident until 1924.\n\nJane Addams referred Dunlap to the Roadside Settlement in Des Moines, and Dunlap accepted the position of head resident in 1904. Dunlap had been offered to go to another house in the east, however Addams believed she would have more autonomy in the western area. The settlement was located in a commercial neighborhood, causing a decrease in clientele to serve.\n\nThe settlement board voted to relocate the home to South Bottom near the Des Moines River. Dunlap oversaw the construction of this three-story brick building. The new home opened in 1906 and was regarded by Dunlap as one of her greatest achievements. As the Roadside house became open to the public, Dunlap established several programs including sewing and cooking classes, as well as manual training and literary clubs. Dunlap served as head resident of the Roadside Settlement House for two decades.\n\nIn 1912 Dunlap ran for the Des Moines school board. Her community involvement earned Dunlap the support of local women’s clubs who endorsed her candidacy and distributed her campaign advertisements in various local establishments. Dunlap won the election as the first woman to ever serve on the board. After three years of serving, Dunlap reported it was “the most unpleasant and most futile task” she had managed. Dunlap concluded the board was not ready for women and neglected to run for re-election after complaining none of the other male members would speak or listen to her opinions.\n\nDuring this same time period, Dunlap served as legislative chair of the Iowa Federation of Women’s Clubs. In 1913 Dunlap won the presidency of the Iowa Equal Suffrage Association. She held office for this position until 1916. During her three years of presidency, Dunlap took to the streets and visited 30 towns to hold educational open-air meetings. In 1916 Dunlap led a campaign in which an amendment to the state constitution was submitted to voters to allow women the right to vote.\n\nIn 1917 and 1918, Dunlap maintained the position of regional director of the girls division of the War Camp Community Service.\n\n"}

This was the first \"Madden\" title to pause the action and rotate the screen during punts, kickoffs and turnovers, rather than instantly reversing P.O.V. to the opposite side of the field, which could be disorienting to players. The field could also be rotated to view plays from any angle in instant replay.\n\nThis was also the first of the \"Madden\" games to have Super Bowl teams available for play without any special codes.\n\nDue to an error, the entire rosters for the New York Giants and New York Jets were reversed. For example, the quarterback for the Jets was #11 (Phil Simms of the Giants) while the quarterback for the Giants was #7 (Boomer Esiason of the Jets). This error affected at least the copies for SNES available during the Christmas shopping season of 1993.\n\nCertain versions of the game were labeled as \"Limited First Round Editions\".\n\nThe game was a bestseller in the US, and made number 15 in the UK.\n"}

This version of \"Madden NFL\" was also the first \"Madden\" to showcase no passing windows, though passing windows can be retained using the options menu.

Reviewing the Genesis version in \"GamePro\", Athletic Supporter noted that \"unlike its SNES counterpart, \"Madden '95\" on the Genesis doesn't \"always\" generate high-scoring games.\"[emphasis in original] Ben D. Rules, also of \"GamePro\", commented that the Game Boy version, while having unavoidable portable limitations such as tiny, unrecognizable sprites and mediocre sound effects, has a surprisingly strong selection of teams and stats and well-designed gameplay. He concluded \"While football on handhelds will probably never take off, this one's still a worthy effort.\" Fellow \"GamePro\" reviewer Tommy Glide similarly praised the Game Gear version as a worthy handheld effort which retains most of the options, teams, and plays of the home versions. However, he concluded that despite being \"the best football game available for the Game Gear\", it is not a worthwhile purchase due to the tiny, squint-inducing graphics and lack of multiplayer. In 2012, \"Madden NFL '95\" was listed on Time's All-TIME 100 greatest video games list.\n"}

The 28 pre-expansion teams are each represented by a classic era equivalent, which range from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players on those classic era teams are identified by their squad numbers only. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, do not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor do the All-Madden team. However, Carolina is attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-A-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hide the \"superteams\" with players named after the developers; these teams are accessed using unstated cheat codes.\n\n\"Madden '96\", developed by Visual Concepts, was originally planned to be the first NFL game on the PlayStation shortly after the console's launch in 1995. Features were to include customizable playbooks, penalties, weather conditions, and playing surfaces, and commentary from John Madden, Pat Summerall, James Brown, and Lesley Visser.ref></ref> But after several delays, the game was canceled because it did not meet EA's quality assurance standards. Visual Concepts would later go on to make the \"NFL 2K\" series of games.\n\nThe two sports reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the Genesis version scores of 9.5 and 9.0 out of 10, stating that \"EA listened to players and has come up with the best 16-bit football game ever made.\" They praised the \"hard as hell\" AI and the addition of speed bursts. A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" deemed it \"a definite improvement from last year's poor effort\", citing the more solid player graphics, faster play, and tougher AI. He further remarked that while Sega's \"Prime Time NFL\" was still the best football video game in single player, \"Madden NFL '96\" was the best two-player experience. He gave it four out of five stars. Slo Mo of \"GamePro\" found the AI a somewhat mixed blessing, remarking that \"The mean and nasty A.I. will answer the prayers of hardcore Madden players, but it will surely frustrate rookies and bandwagon fans.\" He also deemed the new Scouting Combine feature \"an excellent idea that could nonetheless use some tinkering.\" However, he praised the rendered character sprites, the widened camera views, and the new moves, and gave the game a recommendation. He judged the SNES version to be superior to the Genesis version due to its faster animation and inclusion of drills specific to each position, and called it \"the top-ranked SNES football cart\".\n\n\"GamePro\" panned the Game Boy version in a brief review, stating, \"This Madden features no NFL license, old lineups, and none of the improvements made to the '96 SNES version. The small sprites will cause eye strain, player control is difficult, and passes sound like bombs falling from the sky.\" They made many of the same criticisms of the Game Gear version, which they noted had better control but was still \"a below-average attempt to bring football into the handheld arena.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2147062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147062", "title": "Wildlife of Bermuda", "text": "Wildlife of Bermuda\n\nThe flora and fauna of Bermuda form part of a unique ecosystem due to Bermuda's isolation from the mainland of North America. The wide range of endemic species and the islands form a distinct ecoregion, the Bermuda subtropical conifer forests.\n\nLocated 900 km off the American East Coast, Bermuda is a crescent-shaped chain of 184 islands and islets that were once the rim of a volcano. The islands are slightly hilly rather than having steep cliffs, with the highest point being 79m. The coast has many bays and inlets, with sandy beaches especially on the south coasts. Bermuda has a semi-tropical climate, warmed by the Gulf Stream current. Bermuda is very densely populated. Twenty of the islands are inhabited.\n\nWildlife that could fly to the island or were carried there by winds and currents formed the species. There are no native mammals other than bats, and only two reptiles, but large numbers of birds, plants, and insects. Once on the island, organisms had to adapt to local conditions, such as the humid climate, lack of fresh water, frequent storms, and salt spray. The area of the islands shrank as water levels rose at the end of the Pleistocene epoch, and fewer species were able to survive in the reduced land-area. Nearly 8,000 different species of flora and fauna are known from the islands of Bermuda. The number is likely to be considerably higher if all microorganisms, cave-dwellers and deep-sea species were counted.\n\nToday the variety of species on Bermuda has been greatly increased by introductions, both deliberate and accidental. Many of these introduced species have posed a threat to the native flora and fauna because of competition and interference with habitat.\n\nOver 1000 species of vascular plant are found on the islands, the majority of which are introduced. Of the 165 native species, 17 are endemic.\n\nAt the time of the first human settlement by shipwrecked English sailors in 1593, Bermuda was dominated by forests of Bermuda cedar (\"Juniperus bermudiana\") with mangrove swamps on the coast. More deliberate settlement began after 1609, and colonists began clearing forests to use for building and shipmaking, and to develop agricultural cultivation. By the 1830s, the demands of the shipbuilding industry had denuded the forests, but these recovered in many areas.\n\nIn the 1940s the cedar forests were devastated by introduced scale insects, which killed roughly 8 million trees. Replanting using resistant trees has taken place since then, but the area covered by cedar is only 10% of what it used to be. Another important component of the original forest was Bermuda palmetto (\"Sabal bermudana\"), a small palm tree. It now grows in a few small patches, notably at Paget Marsh. Other trees and shrubs include Bermuda olivewood (\"Cassine laneana\") and Bermuda snowberry (\"Chiococca alba\"). The climate allows for the growth of other palms such as royal palm (\"Roystonea\" spp.) and coconut palm (\"Cocos nucifera\"), although the lack of very warm temperatures does not usually allow coconuts to fruit properly. Bermuda is the farthest north location in the Northern Hemisphere where coconut palms will grow naturally.\n\nRemnant patches of mangrove swamp can be found around the coast and at some inland sites, including Hungry Bay Nature Reserve and Mangrove Lake, Bermuda. These were important for moderating the effects of storms and providing transition habitats. Here black mangrove (\"Avicennia germinans\") and red mangrove (\"Rhizophora mangle\") are the northernmost mangroves in the Atlantic. The inland swamps are particularly interesting as mangroves thrive in salty water; in this case, the saltwater arrives through underground channels rather than the usual tidal wash of coastal mangrove swamps. Areas of peat marsh include Devonshire, Pembroke, and Paget marshes.\n\nBermuda has four endemic ferns: Bermuda maidenhair fern (\"Adiantum bellum\"), Bermuda Shield Fern (\"Thelypteris bermudiana\"), Bermuda cave fern (\"Ctenitis sloanei\") and Governor Laffan's fern (\"Diplazium laffanianum\"). The latter is extinct in the wild but is grown at Bermuda Botanical Gardens. The endemic flora of the island also include two mosses, ten lichens and forty fungi.\n\nAmong the many introduced species are the Casuarina (\"Casuarina equisetifolia\") and Suriname cherry (\"Eugenia uniflora\").\n\nBermudiana (\"Sisyrinchium bermudiana\")\nDarrell's fleabane (\"Erigeron darrellianus\")\nBermuda campylopus (moss) (\"Campylopus bermudianus\")\nBermuda bean (\"Phaseolus lignosus\")\nBermuda spike rush (\"Elecharis bermudiana\")\nBermuda trichostomum (moss) (\"Trichostomum bermudanum\")\nGovernor Laffan's fern (\"Diplazium laffanianum\")\n\nBermuda has no native amphibians. A species of toad, cane toad (\"Rhinella marina\"), and two species of frog, Antilles coqui (\"Eleutherodactylus johnstonei\"), and \"Eleutherodactylus gossei\" were introduced by humans and subsequently became naturalized. \"R. marina\" and \"E. johnstonei\" are common, but \"E. gossei\" is thought to have been recently extirpated.\n\nFour species of lizard and two species of turtle comprise Bermuda's non-marine reptilian fauna. Of the lizards, the Bermuda rock skink (\"Plestiodon longirostris\"), is the only endemic species. Once very common, the Bermuda skink is critically endangered. The Jamaican anole (\"Anolis grahami\") was deliberately introduced in 1905 from Jamaica and is now by far the most common lizard in Bermuda. The Leach's anole (\"Anolis leachii\") was accidentally introduced from Antigua about 1940 and is now common. The Barbados anole (\"Anolis extremus\") was accidentally introduced about 1940 and is rarely seen. The diamondback terrapin (\"Malaclemys terrapin\") is native to Bermuda. The red-eared slider (\"Trachemys scripta elegans\") was introduced as a pet, but has subsequently become invasive.\n\nAll mammals in Bermuda are human introductions, except for four species of migratory North American bats of the genus \"Lasiurus\": the hoary bat, eastern red bat, Seminole bat and silver-haired bat. Early accounts refer to wild or feral hogs, descendants of pigs left by the Spanish and Portuguese as feedstock for ships stopping at the islands for supplies. The house mouse, brown rat and black rat were accidentally introduced soon after the settlement of Bermuda, and feral cats have become common as another introduced species.\n\nOver 360 species of bird have been recorded on Bermuda. The majority of these are migrants or vagrants from North America or elsewhere. Only 24 species breed; 13 of these are thought to be native.\n\nOne endemic species is the Bermuda petrel or cahow (\"Pterodroma cahow\"), which was thought to have been extinct since the 1620s. Its ground-nesting habitats had been severely disrupted by introduced species and colonists had killed the birds for food. In 1951, researchers discovered 18 breeding pairs, and started a recovery program to preserve and protect the species.\n\nAn endemic subspecies is the Bermuda white-eyed vireo or chick-of-the-village (\"Vireo griseus bermudianus\"). The national bird of Bermuda is the white-tailed tropicbird or longtail, which is a summer migrant to Bermuda, its most northerly breeding site in the world. Other native birds include the eastern bluebird, grey catbird and perhaps the common ground dove. The common moorhen is the most common native waterbird; very small numbers of American coot and pied-billed grebe are breeding. Small numbers of common tern nest around the coast. The barn owl and mourning dove colonized the island during the 20th century, and the green heron has recently begun to breed.\n\nOf the introduced birds, the European starling, house sparrow, great kiskadee, rock dove, American crow and chicken are all very numerous and considered to be pests. Other introduced species include the mallard, northern cardinal, European goldfinch and small numbers of orange-cheeked and common waxbills. The yellow-crowned night heron was introduced in the 1970s to replace the extinct native heron.\n\nFossil remains of a variety of species have been found on the island, including a crane, an owl and the short-tailed albatross. Some of these became extinct as the islands' land-mass shrunk, while others were exterminated by early settlers. The Bermuda petrel was thought to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1951.\n\nAmong the many non-breeding migrants are a variety of shorebirds, herons and ducks. In spring many shearwaters can be seen of the South Shore. Over 30 species of New World warbler are seen each year, with the yellow-rumped warbler being the most abundant. The arrival of many species is dependent on weather conditions; low-pressure systems moving across from North America often bring many birds to the islands. Among the rare visitors recorded are the Siberian flycatcher from Asia and the fork-tailed flycatcher and tropical kingbird from South America.\n\nMore than 1100 kinds of insects and spiders are found on Bermuda, including 41 endemic insects and a possibly endemic spider. Eighteen species of butterfly have been seen; about six of these breed on the islands, including the large monarch and the very common Bermuda buckeye (\"Junonia coenia bergi\"). More than 200 moths have been recorded; one of the most conspicuous is \"Pseudosphinx tetrio\", which can reach in length.\n\nBermuda has lost a number of its endemic invertebrates, including the Bermuda cicada (\"Neotibicen bermudianus\"), which became extinct when the cedar forests disappeared. Some species feared extinct have been rediscovered, including a Bermuda land snail (\"Poecilozonties circumfirmatus\") and the Bermuda ant (\"Odontomachus insularis\").\n\nBermuda lies on the western edge of the Sargasso Sea, an area with high salinity, high temperature and few currents. Large quantities of seaweed of the genus \"Sargassum\" are present and there are high concentrations of plankton, but the area is less attractive to commercial fish species and seabirds.\n\nGreater diversity is present in the coral reefs which surround the island.\n\nA variety of whales, dolphins and porpoises have been recorded in the waters around Bermuda. The most common of these is the humpback whale, which passes the islands in April and May during its northward migration.\n\nBermuda was the first place in the Americas to pass conservation laws, protecting the Bermuda petrel in 1616 and the Bermuda cedar in 1622. It has a well-organised network of protected areas including Spittal Pond, marshes in Paget and Devonshire and Pembroke Parishes, Warwick Pond and the hills above Castle Harbour.\n\nOnly small areas of natural forest remain today; much was cleared since colonisation began in the 17th century, and recovered forest was lost in the 1940s due to insect infestation. The Bermuda petrel and Bermuda skink are highly endangered, and Bermuda cedar, Bermuda palmetto and Bermuda olivewood are all listed as threatened species. Some wild plants, including a spike rush, have disappeared. Introduced plants and animals have had adverse effects on the wildlife of the islands. The thriving tourist industry creates its own challenges to preserve the wildlife and habitat that attract visitors.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2147073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147073", "title": "Saving All My Love for You", "text": "Saving All My Love for You\n\n\"Saving All My Love for You\" is a song written by Michael Masser and Gerry Goffin with arrangement by Gene Page. It was originally a minor hit for Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. in 1978 on their album \"Marilyn & Billy\". A cover of the song was done by American singer Whitney Houston, for her debut, self-titled album, which was released on February 14, 1985, by Arista Records. The song was the second single from the album in the United States and third worldwide.\n\nThe song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who picked it as one of the album's highlights and praised her vocals on the song. Houston also earned her first Grammy Award with the song, on the category Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Commercially, the song topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, being her first number one on the charts; it also went to number one in both the UK and Ireland, and was her first major hit in the British Isles. In the United States, it was awarded a Gold certification from the RIAA in 1995.\n\n\"Saving All My Love for You\" was written by Michael Masser and Gerry Goffin during the 1970s and originally recorded with Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. on their LP \"Marilyn and Billy\" (1978). Years later, Masser saw Whitney for the first time when he went into New York City's Sweetwater club, an invitation made by Arista Records president Clive Davis, and she was singing one of his songs, \"The Greatest Love of All\". After her performance, the singer told Masser that the song was one of her favorites and later, Masser was chosen by Arista to produce some tracks for Houston's self-titled debut. After getting the right emotionally vulnerable-tailored take from Houston, the producer guaranteed her that it would become \"a woman's song\", meaning that women will feel a special affinity for the song.\n\nAfter the success of her previous single, \"You Give Good Love\", the label initially didn't think about releasing \"Saving All My Love for You\" as the next single. When Masser heard that another single besides the song was being considered for the next single, he made a friendly wager with Davis during one of Houston's performance at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles. He proposed that if all the women get on their feet when Houston sings \"Saving...\", then Davis would agree that it should be the next single. Ultimately, the song was released as the second single in the United States and third single worldwide.\n\n\"Saving All My Love for You\" is a soul and R&B song, composed in the key of A major, having a slowly tempo of 84 beats per minute. Houston's vocal range on the song span from the low-note of F#3 to the high-note of F#5. The song features a saxophone solo by Tom Scott and lyrically talks about a young woman preparing for the arrival of her married lover, with lyrics like, \"You've got your family, and they need you there/Though I've tried to resist, being last on your list/But no other man's gonna do/So I'm saving all my love for you.\" Dave Heaton of \"PopMatters\" wrote that Whitney sings some parts with bittersweet lightness (\"that’s just an old fantasy\") and other parts with urgent heaviness (\"tonight is the night\"), exactly right for carrying the feelings in the song.\n\nThe song also caused controversy due to its lyrics about having an affair with a married man. Houston's mother Cissy Houston didn't at all like the scenario described in the lyrics, claiming that the song's message would reflect badly on her daughter. However, Whitney herself confessed, \"I was going through a terrible love affair. He was married, and that will never work out for anybody. Never, no way.\"\n\n\"Saving All My Love for You\" received positive reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic picked the song as a highlight on the album, writing that the song \"burns slowly and seductively.\" Dave Heaton of \"PopMatters\" praised Whitney for \"singing as 'the other woman', ratcheting up the drama without overdoing it.\" Liam Lacey of \"The Globe and Mail\" wrote that 'Saving All My Love for You', 'Greatest Love Of All' and 'Hold Me In Your Arms' \"are some of the loveliest pop singing on vinyl since the glory days of Dionne Warwick.\" Sputnikmusic called it \"the sexiest, most romantic song on the record.\" Brad Wete of \"Vibe\" called it \"goliath\", writing that the song \"was a fresh serving of precocious talent compared to 1985's mildly flavored R&B bluffet.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" praised her vocal performance, writing that, \"it should mean a cinch Grammy nomination.\"\n\n\"Saving All My Love for You\" earned Whitney her first Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female in 1986. She also won the American Music Award for Favorite R&B/Soul Video for \"Saving All My Love for You\". The song also entered the list of her best songs. While listing her \"25 Best Songs\", editors from \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed the song at number 21, writing that, \"The stuff that's been piped into thousands of dentist offices, it was also her first No. 1 hit.\" BET placed the song at number 7 on their \"40 Best Whitney Houston Songs\", writing that, \"The song has it all: her breathy come-ons, her trademark epic high notes, her delicate runs.\" Kelley L. Carter of MTV also listed the track on their \"Whitney Houston's Top 10 Songs\", complimenting the singer for taking an already-recorded song and giving it new life.\"\n\n'On \"The New York Daily News\"'s \"The 100 Greatest Love Songs\", \"Saving All My Love for You\" was placed at number 79. The song was also on \"The Telegraph\",s \"The 50 Best Love Songs of the 80's\", with the authors wrote that, \"The song that launched Whitney, invented a newly minted variety of globe-storming soul diva\", picking the line, \"Though I try to resist, being last on your list/But no other man's gonna do/So I'm saving all my love for you,\" as \"killer\".\n\nReleased in 1985, Whitney's version of \"Saving All My Love for You\" entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 53, jumping to number 39 the following week (August 24), and reaching the Top 10 five weeks later. The single reached the number-one spot the week of October 26, 1985, and would become the first of seven record-setting consecutive number-one singles in the United States for Houston; a record that still holds. The single eventually spent fifteen weeks in the top forty. It also hit the top of the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It ranked number 5 on \"Billboard\" Year-end Top Black Singles chart.\n\nThe song also became a global hit, hitting number-one or the Top 10 in various countries around the world. In the United Kingdom, the song hit number-one on December 8, 1985, spending two weeks at the top. The single went on to become one of the top 25 best-selling singles of 1985 in the UK, and has since sold 740,000 copies. In 2012, Dan Lane of The Official Charts Company listed \"Houston’s Top 20 Biggest Selling Tracks In The UK To Date\" and \"Saving All My Love for You\" was placed at number 3, only losing to \"I Will Always Love You\" and \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\".\n\nIn New Zealand, the song debuted at number 45, on November 3, 1985. It kept on climbing in the following two weeks, until it peaked at number 6, before dropping to number 8. However, on December 8, 1985, the song reached a new peak of number 5. The song was also a success in Switzerland, peaking at number 5, while in France, the song charted two times in different years. Firstly, the song charted when it was originally released in 1986, debuting at number 50 and peaking at number 11, while in 2012 (after Whitney's death), the song peaked at number 39.\n\nThe music video was directed by Stuart Orme and was filmed in London, where Whitney was doing a promotional tour. The narrative for the music video follows the song's theme: Whitney's character is a recording artist who is emotionally involved with her married producer, played by Ricco Ross. By the finale, he has returned to his wife and family, leaving her (the \"other woman\") romantically out in the cold.\n\nAt the time of release, the adultery theme of the video for \"Saving All My Love for You\" generated much media controversy, which led Whitney to insist, \"I could never see myself in that position. I wouldn't just take whatever someone wants to give to me, especially if I am giving a lot to him but not getting that much back. I could never find myself in that situation, but someone else might. The video tells a story but it's by no means my story.\" Despite the controversy, the video won \"Favorite Soul/R&B Video\" on the American Music Awards of 1986.\n\nWhitney performed \"Saving All My Love for You\" in a number of places. Whitney performed the track for the 28th Annual Grammy Awards and later took home the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Award for the song. Her performance of the ballad at the GRAMMYs won her an Emmy for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program. She also performed the song on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" in 1985. The performance was considered one of her best live performances by Digital Spy and VH1. While Liam O'Brien of Digital Spy wrote, \"In this assured performance on Late Night With David Letterman, her vocal gymnastics left the host stunned,\" Mark Graham of \"VH1\" simply picked it as her third best live performance.\n\nShe also included the track in all of her concert tours: The Greatest Love World Tour (1986), Moment of Truth World Tour (1987–1988), Feels So Right Tour (1990), I'm Your Baby Tonight World Tour (1991), The Bodyguard World Tour (1993–1994), Pacific Rim Tour (1997), The European Tour (1998), My Love Is Your Love World Tour (1999), Soul Divas Tour (2004) and on her final tour, Nothing but Love World Tour (2009–2010). \"Saving All My Love for You\" was also added to the setlist of her first ever solo televised concert and DVD/video release, \"Welcome Home Heroes with Whitney Houston\" (1991) and on her second DVD/video, \"\" (1994).\n\n\n\n\n"}

It also oversaw the \"Kommandoamt der Allgemeine SS\" (General SS HQ). Hans Jüttner was promoted to the position of chief-of-staff of the SS-FHA and handled the day-to-day operations. When Himmler stepped down as SS-FHA chief in 1943, Jüttner took over as chief of the department till the end of the war.\n\nRecruiting members for the Waffen-SS was handled through the SS-HA and its chief, Gottlob Berger. This caused overlapping jurisdiction and friction between the two SS branches. Berger's SS-HA had a problematic relationship with the SS-FHA, which was responsible for organising, training and equipping the Waffen-SS. Jüttner's initial efforts at integrating the recruits from western Europe and Scandinavia were inadequate with insufficient emphasis on training and appointing officers and non-commissioned officers from the ranks of the new recruits. The SS-FHA also wanted the Waffen-SS to be a small elite corps, but Berger and Himmler knew that Adolf Hitler needed as many divisions as possible, even if that meant some Waffen-SS formations would be of lesser quality. During the war years, to meet the high casualty rates and expansion needs of the Waffen-SS, members of the \"Allgemeine SS\" and other personnel working for SS organisations were used for compulsory recruitment drives by the SS-HA to meet the manpower needs of the Waffen-SS.\n\nDepartmental Group A (\"Amtsgruppe A\") \nOrganisation, Personnel and Supply (\"Organisation, Personal, Versorgung\")\n\n\nDepartmental Group B (\"Amtsgruppe B\")\nTraining (\"Ausbildung\")\n\n\nDepartmental Group C (\"Amtsgruppe C\")\nInspection (\"Inspektionen\")<br>\n\nDepartmental Group D (\"Amtsgruppe D\")\nMedical Arm of the Waffen-SS (\"Sanitätswesen der Waffen-SS\")\n\n\n"}

He retired as the all-time leader in victories at the University of Illinois with 423 victories and New Mexico State with 289 victories. Overall Henson won 779 games, putting him in sixteenth place on the all-time list. Henson is also one of only four NCAA coaches to have amassed at least 200 total wins at two institutions. On February 17, 2015, Henson was selected as a member of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. In August 2015, prior to the reopening of the newly renovated State Farm Center at the University of Illinois, the hardwood floor was dedicated and renamed Lou Henson Court in his honor. The court at the Pan American Center at New Mexico State University is also named in his honor.\n\nBorn in Okay, Oklahoma, Henson graduated from Okay High School in 1951 and matriculated at Connors Junior College before transferring to New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (New Mexico A&M, now New Mexico State University). He lettered in basketball for the New Mexico A&M Aggies from 1953 to 1955 and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1955 and master's degree in 1956.\n\nHenson began his coaching career at Las Cruces High School in Las Cruces, New Mexico in 1956. After two years as junior varsity coach, Henson was head coach of the varsity team from 1958 to 1962 and won state championships in 1959, 1960, and 1961.\n\nHe started coaching in the college ranks in 1962 at Hardin-Simmons University. As a condition of taking the Hardin-Simmons job, Henson insisted that the team (and thus the school) be racially integrated, a condition to which the university agreed. In 1966, he took over at his alma mater, New Mexico State University. In his first season at NMSU, the Aggies rebounded from a 4–22 record in the prior season to finish 15–11 and went to the NCAA Tournament. In 1970, Henson would help lead the Aggies to the Final Four for the only time in the school's history. Henson and future NBA players Jimmy Collins, Sam Lacey, and Charlie Criss lost in the tournament semifinal to eventual champion UCLA, the third time in three years the Aggies lost to UCLA in the tournament. Henson coached at New Mexico State for nine seasons, with six trips to the NCAA Tournament and four twenty-win seasons.\n\nIn 1975, Henson moved to the University of Illinois to replace Gene Bartow, after Bartow left Illinois to replace John Wooden at UCLA. In 21 years at Illinois, Henson garnered 423 wins and 224 losses (.654 winning percentage), and with a record of 214 wins and 164 losses (.567) in Big Ten Conference games. The 214 wins in Big Ten games were the third highest total ever at the time of his retirement. His best Fighting Illini team was the 1988-89 unit, which won a then-school record 31 games and went to the Final Four. At Illinois, Henson coached many future NBA players, including Eddie Johnson, Derek Harper, Ken Norman, Nick Anderson, Kendall Gill, Kenny Battle, Marcus Liberty, Steve Bardo, and Kiwane Garris, and was known for his trademark Lou-Do.\n\nIn 1997, Henson returned to New Mexico State as interim head coach after Neil McCarthy was abruptly fired before the start of the season. Henson wanted to donate his time, but was told that state law didn't allow him to coach for free. He finally accepted a nominal salary of $1 per month. After a successful season, he was given his old job back on a permanent basis. His 1998–99 team won the Big West regular season and tournament titles—notably, the first time in Henson's career that he had won a conference tournament. He retired for good midway through the 2004–05 season due to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His second stint allowed him to regain his standing as New Mexico State's all-time winningest coach, passing McCarthy.\n\nIn July 2007, Henson announced that he was again undergoing chemotherapy for the same strain of lymphoma that he had battled four years previously. He was undergoing treatment in Champaign, Illinois, where he lives in the summer. In July 2015, Henson once again entered chemotherapy for \"bone marrow problems.\"\n\nHenson \"returned to coaching\" at age 82 as coach of the New Mexico House of Representatives team in a charity contest versus the New Mexico State Senate team on February 7, 2014.\n\n \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2147084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147084", "title": "General Glory", "text": "General Glory\n\nGeneral Glory is the name of two DC Comics characters. The persona is mostly used by writers as a parody of Marvel's Captain America with exaggerated \"patriotic values\" and a sidekick called Ernie (aka Ernie The Battling Boy), who was similar to Bucky. General Glory first appeared in \"Justice League International\" #46 as a 1940s style hero placed in a modern world, resulting in cultural differences and personality issues. Whereas Captain America is patriotic, heroic, and rational, General Glory is so blindly patriotic that it approaches the point of fault, unwilling and psychologically unable to believe that his country or international peacekeeping organizations have a dark side. He was introduced as a comic foil for the jingoistic Green Lantern corps member Guy Gardner in the early 1990s.\n\nJoseph Jones was a soldier in World War II who was granted superior abilities by Lady Liberty herself upon saying the words:\n\n\"\"Lady of Liberty, hear my plea —<br> For the land of the brave —<br> And home of the free!\"\"\nHe became a government agent, under the authority of an Agent Newkirk Sharp. Sharp arranged for \"General Glory\" comic books to be published, so that people would believe he was a fictional character. In England, his adventures were published in the pages of \"Tuppenny Fun\".\n\nDuring his many adventures in World War 2, General Glory worked with the original Beefeater, an English-based super hero. One mission saw him working with the time-travelling hero Booster Gold- who had come to 1943 looking for his missing adopted daughter- when a Nazi scientist was attempting to create a time machine, although Booster regarded Glory as mentally unbalanced at best.\n\nAs with Marvel Comics' Captain America, General Glory disappeared in an Arctic mission. Rather than be encased in ice, however, he returned to America with little memory of his past. He would later learn that Sharp had drugged him and given him a new identity.\n\nMany years later, he was outbid for a \"General Glory\" comic book by Guy Gardner. He persuaded Gardner to let him read the book by offering him the refund price of the bid. Reading the comic, Jones shouts out the magic words and became General Glory again. Shortly after this, he was arrested for treason by Ernest E. Earnest. It eventually transpired that Sharp had framed Glory to divert suspicion from himself. Ernie confronted him and was shot. Sharp was brought to justice by Glory and the Justice League, and General Glory became a member of the team. Maxwell Lord considered that a true Golden Age hero might be good for their image, and Glory thereafter assists the team from time to time. For example, Glory and the JLA defeat a revenge-crazed elderly Nazi that had been plaguing Jones with technologically advanced threats for some time; often chasing him out of the latest home Jones had created. Said Nazi is finally defeated in issue #50.\n\nIn this time period, Glory owns a dog named 'Liberty'; the pet is featured in a later \"Justice League Quarterly\" issue. The dog unintentionally helps save the JLA who were having miniaturization issues.\n\nGlory assists the League in saving Ice from demonic possession. At the same time he tries to help Maxwell Lord with his seeming drinking problem.\n\nDuring one of Jones's transformations into his elderly self, he suffered a cardiac episode and ended up in the hospital next to New York City policeman Donovan Wallace, who had become paralyzed risking his life to save a child from gangsters.\n\nBy this point, Jones was too weak to change into his alter ego, but he regaled Wallace with inspiring stories about his adventures as Glory (the stories paralleled thematic trends in superhero comics). Initially skeptical, Donovan eventually came to believe in the spirit of glory and he was able to tap into the same energies that once powered Jones. He manifested great strength and agility, wings and throwing razors. He left his hospital bed and crushed the gangs that had crippled him. When he returned to the hospital, Jones was in cardiac arrest. In order to keep his legacy alive, Jones bequeathed his powers to Donovan, whose full mobility was restored. As Donovan becomes the second General Glory, Jones passes away.\n\nWallace was known to be estranged from his wife and child, but in \"Justice Society of America\" vol. 3 #3 it is revealed that Wallace and everyone attending his wedding was dismembered during the ceremony by a Nazi-themed team called the Fourth Reich. This group's mission, backed up by the villain Vandal Savage, was to destroy the legacy of all American heroes whose identities were closely tied to America itself.\n\nDuring the \"52\" series, Martian Manhunter constructs a JLA memorial in the hills above Happy Harbor, a statue dedicated to each fallen JLA member, Glory included.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2147086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147086", "title": "Boris Shumyatsky", "text": "Boris Shumyatsky\n\nBoris Zakharovich Shumyatsky () (November 16, 1886 – July 29, 1938) was the \"de facto\" executive producer for the Soviet film monopoly from 1930 to 1937. He was executed as a traitor in 1938, following a \"purge\" of the Soviet film industry, and much information about him was expunged from the public record as a consequence.\n\nShumyatsky was born in Verkhneudinsk (now Ulan-Ude) in the vicinity of Lake Baikal in Russian Siberia. He appears to have been active in communist circles by 1903. He was a member of the Bolshevik committee in Krasnoyarsk during the 1905 revolution, and was arrested for his role in organising a rail strike. He escaped and by 1907 was working underground in Vladivostok. Arrested again, he was deported to the same region of Siberia where Joseph Stalin was in exile. Following the Russian Revolution he was a party functionary in Soviet Siberia, including a stint as premier of the Far Eastern Republic from November 1920 to April 1921. From 1923 to 1925, he represented Soviet interests in Iran, and after that was in charge of the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, and then a member of the Central Asian Bureau of the Party Central Committee back in Siberia.\n\nIn none of these capacities did he evidently have anything to do with film-making. Nonetheless, following a reorganization of the Soviet film industry he was selected by Stalin to become the head of Soyuzkino in December 1930. When Soyuzkino was dissolved and replaced by GUKF on February 11, 1933, he remained in charge and even with expanded powers over all matters of production, import/export, distribution and exhibition.\n\nHe took over the film industry at a time when it was going through major technological changes, and rapid expansion. The number of cinemas in the USSR almost quadrupled under his supervision, to around 30,000, and silent movies were supplanted by 'talkies'. The first Soviet film with a full sound track was released in October 1931. He was also expected to end import of foreign equipment, and blank film when Soviet factories were not well equipped to supply demand, and he had to contend with tightening censorship and Stalin's personal obsession with cinema, which made it expedient to show new films to Stalin before they went on release, and in many cases to submit scripts to Stalin before shooting began. \n\nAfter visiting Hollywood, he also conceived the idea of creating a similar centre for the film industry at a spot near Odessa, where the climate and geography were similar to those of Hollywood and thus more amenable to year-round film-making. This vision extended to the building of an entire film community, to be called Kinograd—a highly expensive proposition. The output of Soviet films certainly deteriorated in quantity under his supervision: only 35 new films were completed in 1933, compared with 148 in 1928; in 1935, of a planned 130 feature films, only 45 were completed; in 1936, only 46 of 165; in 1937— his final year— only 24 of 62. \n\nThis may have been because he was operating under impossible conditions. Alexander Barmine, who worked with Shumyatsky in Tehran, found him \"gifted with astounding energy, capable of working all day and all night, eager and uncompromising... the stuff of which leaders are made\" and believed that his job as head of the film industry was made impossible by the political demands made on him. By contrast, Jay Leyda, an American student who worked with Sergei Eisenstein, claimed that on the day Shumyatsky was eventually sacked \"all of Moscow's film makers gave parties\" to celebrate.\n\nLeyda's hostility to Shumyatsky resulted from what he saw as the systematic persecution of Eisenstein, who was prevented from completing a film for the entire time that Shumyatsky headed the film industry. Shumyatsky had a role in the suppression of Eisenstein's unfinished film \"Bezhin Meadow\" in 1937, though in the end it was Stalin's decision to ban it. On 18 March 1937 Shumyatsky delivered the opening speech at a three-day conference on cinema, which consisted mainly of an attack on Eisenstein, and on 28 March wrote a letter to Molotov denouncing seven people by name for conspiring to rescue the banned film and \"discredit me as the stifler of the 'brilliant work of S. Eisenstein'\". Four of those he named were arrested and shot. On 16 April, he sent Stalin a note suggesting that Eisenstein should never be allowed to make another film.\n\nShumyatsky was arrested on 8 January 1938. On the same day, \"Pravda\" carried an excoriating account of his record as the head of the cinema industry. He was accused of collaborating with saboteurs within the film industry. On 28 June 1938 he was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad. His reputation was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.\n\nRichard Taylor, \"Ideology as Mass Entertainment: Boris Shumyatsky and Soviet Cinema in the 1930s\", in Richard Taylor and Ian Christie, (eds.), \"Inside the Film Factory\", Routledge Ltd., 1991.\n"}

{"id": "2147092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147092", "title": "Bates numbering", "text": "Bates numbering\n\nBates numbering (also known as Bates stamping, Bates branding, Bates coding or Bates labeling) is used in the legal, medical, and business fields to place one or more of identifying numbers, date and time marks on images and documents as they are scanned or processed, for example, during the discovery stage of preparations for trial or identifying business receipts. Bates stamping can be used to mark and identify images with copyrights by putting a company name, logo and/or legal copyright on them. This process provides identification, protection, and automatic consecutive numbering of the images.\n\nThe Bates Automatic Numbering-Machine or Bates stamper is named after the late 19th century inventor Edwin G. Bates of New York City. He obtained several United States patents for the device from 1891 to 1901, and the patents were assigned to the Bates Manufacturing Company. The earliest patent claimed a \"new and useful improvement in Consecutive-Numbering Machines\", indicating that Bates was not the originator of the idea. Bates' objective was \"generally to increase the effectiveness, simplicity and compactness of machines of this general character\". Each time the machine was pressed down onto a sheet of paper, a rotating wheel was moved incrementally. The original machine described by Bates allowed numbering with a four-digit sequence, ranging from 0000 to 9999. For example, page 852 in a document set would be 0852. Courts and law firms quickly adopted this system.\n\nGeneral Binding Corporation (now General Binding LLC) acquired Bates Manufacturing Company in 1993.\n\nBates numbering is commonly used as an organizational method to label and identify legal documents. Nearly all American law firms use Bates stamps, though the use of manual hand-stamping is becoming increasingly rare because of the rise in electronic numbering — mostly in Portable Document Format (PDF) files rather than printed material. During the discovery phase of litigation, a large number of documents might require the use of unique identifiers for each page of each document for reference and retrieval. Bates numbering, named for the Bates Automatic Numbering-Machine, assigns an arbitrary unique identifier to each page. Such identification may be solely numeric or may contain a combination of letters and numbers (alphanumeric). There is no standard method for numbering documents, nor is there a standard type face used for such numbers.\n\nManual Bates stampers use a self-inking mechanism with four to seven numbered wheels. Some stampers allow for consecutive, repeat, duplicate, and triplicate numbering.\n\nSelf-adhesive labels printed with Bates numbers are common today, as is electronic discovery (eDiscovery) software that can electronically \"stamp\" documents stored as computer files by superimposing numbers onto them. \n\nBates numbering is neither universally used nor consistently applied; for example, The Bluebook does not reference it. But, consistent with The Bluebook, the first citation should make it very clear what is being referenced, such as (Bates Jones000001) or (Bates d123-002), and subsequent consecutive cites should follow the usual practice of \"Id.\" followed by the page number, such as (\"Id.\" 000017) or (\"Id.\" -017).\n\n"}
{"id": "2147096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147096", "title": "Tomás Carrasquilla", "text": "Tomás Carrasquilla\n\nTomás Carrasquilla Naranjo (1858 – 1940) was a Colombian writer who lived in the Antioquia region. He dedicated himself to very simple jobs: tailor, secretary of a judge, storekeeper in a mine, and worker of the Ministry of Public Works. He was an avid reader, and one of the most original Colombian literary writers, greatly influencing the younger generation of his time and later generations. Carrasquilla was little known in his time, according to Federico de Onís, a scholar of Carrasquilla's works. It was only after 1936, when he was already 68 years old, when he was awarded with the National Prize of Literature, that Carrasquilla got a national recognition. Tomás Carrasquilla Library Park is named in his honor.\n\nThe Colombian civil wars of the second part of the 19th century prevented young Carrasquilla from continuing his studies at the University of Antioquia. A committed intellectual, Carrasquilla organized tertulias—social gatherings to read books and discuss them—in his Medellín house. Many young writers and intellectuals of his time joined those tertulias; from that time he was called \"\"Maestro Tomás Carrasquilla\".\" Among Carrasquilla's admirers was Colombian philosopher Fernando González Ochoa.\n\nDe Onís argues that Carrasquilla's work passed unknown in Colombia and abroad at the time because he lived during two different periods of Latin American literature: Costumbrismo and Romanticism, that had representatives like José Asunción Silva in Colombia, and the coming of Modernism as a reaction against Costumbrismo. As many classify the work of Carrasquilla as Costumbrist, so De Onís classifies him.\n\nCarrasquilla's life straddled two centuries, becoming a link between two epochs in Colombia's history. When he was born in 1858, the country was called the Republic of New Granada, newly independent of Spain. In his work \"La Marqueza de Yolombó\", Carrasquilla described how the most simple people of the end of the 18th century saw the events that broke the Colombia's political dependence on Spain.\n\nHe was also a citizen of the once-called United States of Colombia (1863–1886), a time when the Paisa Region saw the colonization of the current coffee areas. He also saw the Colombian industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century, the Thousand Days War, and many other changes in his country.\n\nThe Colombian civil wars of the 19th century were the reason why Carrasquilla could not finish his studies of Law at the University of Antioquia.\n\nOne of those civil wars was reflected in his works \"Luterito\" and \"El Padre Casafús\" (in English, \"\"The Reverend Casafús\"\"). Those books were set in the context of the civil war of 1876, started by the Conservative partisans of Antioquia, Cauca and Tolima against the Liberal government of president Aquileo Parra, who intended to secularize the education. The story develops in the town of Cañasgordas, where a group of fighters prepare themselves to \"defend the Faith.\" In this case, Carrasquilla's work is an approach to the deepest feelings of people during historical events.\n\nCarrasquilla was born in Santo Domingo, an Andean town north-east of Medellín, on the Antioquean Mountain. He was the son of Isaza Carrasquilla and Ecilda Naranjo Moreno. His family owned some gold mines, and this allowed him to live well enough and dedicate himself to writing. One of his friends, also born in Santo Domingo, was the writer Francisco de Paula Rendón.\n\nAt the age of 15, he moved to Medellín to finish his secondary education at the University of Antioquia; he continued his study of law there. He had to abandon his law studies in 1877 because of the start of the civil war.\n\nHe returned to Santo Domingo, where he worked as a tailor and did some jobs in the municipality. Carlos Eugenio Restrepo invited him to the \"Café Literario\" (\"literary café\"), where he had to write a story in order to be admitted. He wrote \"Simón el Mago\" (\"\"Simon the Mage\"\"), one of his most popular stories. \"Simón\" was published in 1890, and brought to the cinema by Colombian director Víctor Gaviria in 1993.\n\nIn 1896, Carrasquilla traveled to Bogotá for the publication of his first novel, \"Frutos de Mi Tierra\" (\"\"Fruits of my Land\"\"), written to demonstrate that any subject can be the matter of a story, which was very well received by critics. On that trip, he came to know José Asunción Silva, to whom he would some years later dedicate the essay \"For the Poet.\"\n\nHe returned to Antioquia and had an accident, falling from a horse, which made him stay in Medellín for a time. When he returned to Santo Domingo, he dedicated himself to writing, until 1904, when he lost his fortune due to the Banco Popular bankruptcy. He then gained work as a storekeeper in a Sonsón gold mine until 1909.\n\nAfter Carrasquilla returned to Medellín, he had a very lively social and cultural life, associating with young intellectuals like Fernando González Ochoa, who became one of his best friend for the rest of his life. González was one of Carrasquilla's biggest admirers. Carrasquilla also knew also the cartoonist Ricardo Rendón, and the skeptic group \"Los Panidas\" (whom he supported, but never joined).\n\nIn 1914, Carrasquilla did some work for Colombia's oldest newspaper, El Espectador, when that publication was edited in Medellín. But soon thereafter, he moved to Bogotá, where he worked for the Ministry of Public Works until 1919.\n\nReturning to Medellín, he continued studying literature, and in 1928 published \"La Marqueza de Yolombó\" (\"\"The Marchioness of Yolombó\"\"), one of the best-known works of Colombian literature.\n\nThe writer stayed in Medellín when his health began to decay and he started to go blind. In 1934, surgery gave him back limited vision; his blindness was not an obstacle to his writing, however, as he began to dictate his works.\n\nIn 1935, Carrasquilla was decorated with the Cross of Boyacá, an award that gives the recipient the same privileges as the president or ex-president of Colombia.\n\nHe wrote \"Hace Tiempos\" (\"\"Long Time Ago\"\") by dictation between 1936 and 1937; that work won him the José María Vergara y Vergara National Prize of Literature and Science from the Colombian Academy of Language. This recognition gave him national fame, and attracted international critics, who admired his work and rescued his name from near-anonymity.\n\nIn December 1940, Tomás Carrasquilla died among a large group of friends and admirers, who called him \"\"Don\" Tomás\" or \"\"Maestro\" Tomás Carrasquilla.\"\n\nCarrasquilla is usually seen as a Costumbrist author, due to the cultural context of his world. The traditional details of the simple folk and the descriptions of scenery in his work are characteristic of Costumbrismo, which was developed in Spain and Latin America during the 19th century. The objective of the Costumbrist author is the description of the frame of the traditions of a people without any further comment to the respect and as a consequence of Romanticism.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, Modernism started to appear in Latin America and Spain. In Colombia, Modernism had authors, journalists, artists, and photographers like González, Greiff, Rendón, and Matiz. Modernism developed as a counter against Costumbrismo. According to Federico de Onís, Carrasquilla knew, and even shared, the new tendencies of Modernism; for example, he gave support to \"Los Panidas\", but kept his own style and originality.\n\nIn this sense, the classification of Carrasquilla as a Costumbrista is not exact. According to De Onís, Carrasquilla's work departs from the static Costumbrismo of the 19th century, that described through description of detail :\n\nFor Colombian journalist Carlos Uribe de los Ríos, Carrasquilla's classification as a Costumbrist author caused him a long marginalization within Colombian literature:\n\nIf there is one thing that proves that Carrasquilla was more than a Costumbrist, and that he used elements of realistic modernism in his work, it is his intellectual relationship and great friendship with the Fernando González Ochoa, the \"filósofo de Otraparte\" (\"Philosopher from somewhere else\"). 39 years apart in age, González knew Carrasquilla at the time he was founding \"Los Panidas\" with Rendón and De Greiff in Medellín .\n\nGonzález, another master of Colombian writing, said in one of his essays about the author in \"Hace Tiempos de Carrasquilla\":\n\nAlthough Carrasquilla's works were only widely available in the Paisa Region during his life, it does not mean that he was completely ignored elsewhere in Colombia and abroad. Especially since 1936, with the recognition of the National Prize of Literature and Science, his work attracted the attention of foreign literary critics, like the Chileans Arturo Torres Rioseco and Mariano Latorre. He kept up a good friendship, by correspondence, with writers like José Martí and Miguel de Unamuno.\n\nCarrasquilla's works are divided into novels, stories, essays, articles, and letters. In 1906, he confessed in a letter to a friend that he was writing because of his economic problems, being in bankruptcy, although all his life he enjoyed a well-off lifestyle and he never married. Some of the articles he wrote in El Espectador made some observers suggest that he was a journalist, but his contributions to that field were rather limited.\n\n\nCarrasquilla's articles and stories that appeared in different publications from Medellín at the beginning of the 20th century were gathered in two collections:\n\n\"La Marqueza de Yolombó\" (1926), a historical novel, is one of Carrasquilla's most popular novels. It describes the reconstruction of a Colombian town at the end of the 18th century, at the height of the movement for independence from Spain. The novel describes the social classes of the time, with the Spaniards and Spaniard Americans at the top, and the low social classes being blacks and mestizos. At the time, Yolombó was a strategic town among the gold mines of Antioquia.\n\n\"Simón El Mago\" was a story written in 1890 in which Carrasquilla ridiculed witchcraft. It also shows the relation between whites and blacks in Colombia at the end of the 19th century, and the mixture of beliefs among the mestizaje. In the story, Toñito, the youngest child at home, is cared by his \"nana\", Frutus, who used to talk to him about the art of witchcraft—something that made a great impression on the boy. The boy decided to have his own adventures using his \"nana\"'s informal lessons, and wound up in terrible trouble that his father arranged with a strong punishment.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by Tegna Inc., as part of a duopoly with Waterbury-licensed CW affiliate WCCT-TV (channel 20). The two stations share studios on Broad Street in downtown Hartford and transmitter facilities on Rattlesnake Mountain in Farmington, Connecticut. On cable, WTIC-TV is carried primarily on channel 6 throughout the market.\n\nA group led by Arnold Chase and his company, Arch Communications, was granted a construction permit for channel 61 in September 1983. Chase originally planned to call his new station WETG, in memory of Ella T. Grasso, the first woman to serve as governor of Connecticut, who died in 1981; these call letters were assigned on February 3, 1984. Grasso's son was a minority partner in Chase's group.\n\nHowever, changes in Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations during this time allowed separately-owned stations in the same market to obtain consent to share a call sign. Chase then asked his father, owner of WTIC radio (1080 AM and 96.5 FM) to allow Arch to use the historic WTIC-TV call letters. After securing consent, Arch applied for a waiver to use the call sign in June 1984; the call change took effect on August 4 (the WETG call letters were subsequently used by a station in Erie, Pennsylvania, now fellow Fox affiliate WFXP). The WTIC-TV call sign had last been used by what is now WFSB (channel 3) from 1957 to 1974. In memory of Grasso, WTIC showed clips during their nightly sign-off of Grasso at work while church bells played \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". A graphic at the end of the sequence mentioned that the station was dedicated in Grasso's memory.\n\nWTIC-TV began operation on September 17, 1984, with a special live broadcast of a gala event hosted by TV star Eddie Albert and longtime WTIC radio personality Bob Steele. On this date, the station became the first station in New England to broadcast a stereo audio signal. Former President Jimmy Carter was in attendance. Originally, it was a general entertainment independent station running cartoons, sitcoms, old movies, CBS shows pre-empted by WFSB, ABC shows pre-empted by WTNH (channel 8), NBC shows pre-empted by WVIT (channel 30), drama series, and sports in competition with the established independent station in the market, WTXX (channel 20, now CW-affiliated sister station WCCT-TV). During 1985 and 1986, the station invested in stronger programming.\n\nWTIC later became a charter Fox affiliate when the network launched on October 6, 1986. However, by 1987, Arch encountered financial problems and WTIC nearly filed for bankruptcy. Many syndication distributors went unpaid and responded by pulling their programming from channel 61. Extensive litigation followed as the contracts that were standard in the industry at that time stated that if a single payment was missed, no more programs would be provided, but the station was still required to pay the full amount due under the contract. As the litigation progressed, the shows were replaced by low-budget barter programming. Central to the litigation were allegations of illegal \"tie-in\" sales by program syndicators that artificially drove up the cost of programming to WTIC. The cases soon settled on terms favorable to Chase and WTIC. From the time it joined the network, WTIC-TV had served as the default Fox affiliate for the majority of the Springfield–Holyoke market in western Massachusetts, as that area had been one of the few television markets in the Eastern Time Zone without an affiliate of its own; Berkshire County was served by Albany affiliate WXXA-TV instead, as that county had been considered to be part of the Capital District region. This changed on March 31, 2008 when ABC affiliate WGGB-TV added Fox programming on its second digital subchannel.\nChase Broadcasting (owned by Arnold Chase's father's organization) acquired WTIC on October 2, 1987. Although the barter programming continued, the station began to realize some sustained success in part due to the early success of the Fox network and shows like \"21 Jump Street\" and \"Married...With Children\". A milestone was reached in 1992, when WTIC began to regularly beat WTXX in the ratings. That year, Chase agreed to sell its four television stations—WTIC-TV, WATL in Atlanta, KDVR in Denver, and WXIN in Indianapolis—to Renaissance Broadcasting, owner of WTXX. The sale did not include the WTIC radio stations, which Chase retained until 1996. To comply with prevailing FCC regulations, Renaissance sold WTXX to a Roman Catholic non-profit group, Counterpoint Communications; both deals were completed in March 1993. Renaissance tried to negotiate a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Counterpoint in which it would buy WTXX's entire broadcast day, except for overnights and an hour during the day in which WTXX was to run Catholic programming. During negotiations, which lasted from the time the sale became final until July 1993, Renaissance agreed to have WTXX run \"The Disney Afternoon\" from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. and some off network sitcoms from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. weekdays free of charge, as well as first run syndicated shows on weekends in this slot. However, Counterpoint wanted only a part-time arrangement, and negotiations ultimately fell through. Eventually, WTXX entered into a part-time LMA with WVIT (channel 30).\n\nAfter talks with Counterpoint fell through, Renaissance moved most of WTXX's stronger programming to WTIC, creating a stronger lineup for channel 61. Some programming (such as older sitcoms), however, was returned to their syndication distributors and wound up first on WTWS (channel 26, now Ion Television owned-and-operated station WHPX-TV) and then WTVU (channel 59, now MyNetworkTV affiliate WCTX). The cartoons that did not move to WTIC were sold to WVIT, which ultimately moved them back to WTXX.\n\nOn July 1, 1996, Chicago-based Tribune Broadcasting (then-owner of New York City superstation WPIX) announced that it would acquire Renaissance Communications for $1.13 billion. Two years later, WTIC-TV replaced WVIT as the LMA partner for WTXX (then a UPN affiliate, later with The WB, currently a CW affiliate). In 2001, Tribune bought WTXX outright. Both stations became sister properties of the \"Hartford Courant\" after Times Mirror merged with Tribune in 2000. As time went on, WTIC began dropping cartoons, movies, and older sitcoms in favor of more talk and reality shows. The weekday cartoons ended at the end of 2001 when Fox ended its weekday kids' block.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Tribune announced plans to spin off its publishing division into a separate company. Once the split was finalized in 2014, WTIC-TV and WCCT-TV remained with the Tribune Company (which retained all non-publishing assets, including the broadcasting, digital media and Media Services units), while its newspapers (including the \"Hartford Courant\") became part of the similarly named Tribune Publishing Company. Despite the split, the stations remained in the \"Courant\" building.\n\nOn October 19, 2015, the station announced that it would drop the \"Fox CT\" name and return to its previous \"Fox 61\" designation (which had been phased out in 2010). The decision came after viewers were asked which title they preferred and to share their feelings in a special social media campaign. Responses were overwhelmingly in favor of a return to the original branding, with many citing the nostalgia of the broadcast's original analog signal appearing on channel 61.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that it would acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. Three weeks after the FCC's July 18 vote to have the deal reviewed by an administrative law judge amid \"serious concerns\" about Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, on August 9, 2018, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, intending to seek other M&A opportunities. Tribune also filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Media Group—which has owned ABC affiliate WTNH and MyNetworkTV affiliate WCTX since January 2017—announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. As FCC regulations prohibit common ownership of more than two stations in the same media market, or two or more of the four highest-rated stations in the market, Nexstar was required to sell two of the stations (including one ranking among the top four in total-day viewership) to a separate, unrelated company to address the ownership conflict. On March 20, 2019, McLean, Virginia-based Tegna Inc. announced it would purchase WTIC and WCCT from Nexstar upon consummation of the merger, as part of the company's sale of nineteen Nexstar- and Tribune-operated stations to Tegna and the E. W. Scripps Company (the latter of which would acquire WPIX) in separate deals worth $1.32 billion; this made the WTIC/WCCT duopoly the first television properties in Connecticut and southern New England for Tegna. The sale was completed on September 19, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWTIC-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 61, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 31, using PSIP to display WTIC-TV's virtual channel as 61 on digital television receivers, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition,\n\nSince Fox began airing sports programming in 1994, WTIC has had to deal with issues regarding Major League Baseball and NFL coverage. Connecticut is split between the traditional home territories for Boston and New York City teams. The football issue is not typically as stark because the New York Giants and New England Patriots play in separate conferences, each with their own network television deals, so there is little overlap. However, it used to be a source of frustration during baseball season. On occasion, Fox will pick both the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox for its baseball broadcast windows. Usually, MLB limits Fox to a single game and does not allow any other station to broadcast baseball in that window (from 3:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., and since 2012, alternately from 7:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.), including the cable channels that usually air Yankees and Red Sox games, YES and NESN. This historically resulted in numerous complaints among Connecticut baseball fans when WTIC would only be able to broadcast either the Yankees or the Red Sox. The network has since relented, and now allows WCCT to broadcast the other game in the case of a Yankees/Red Sox conflict, as well as in the case of a Red Sox/Mets conflict. Beginning with the 2008 season to alleviate coverage issues, game broadcasts of the New York Mets from sister station WPIX have alternated between WTIC and WCCT.\n\nWTIC-TV presently broadcasts 56½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 9½ hours each weekday and 4½ hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output of any television station in the state of Connecticut.\n\nThe station broadcasts the \"Xfinity Sports Desk\" at 10:45 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday nights. WTIC also produces a weekly public affairs show, \"The Real Story\", which airs Sunday mornings at 10:00 a.m. Along with obtaining world and national news footage from Fox News, WTIC also receives news footage from CNN Newsource and the Associated Press.\n\nIn 1989, WTIC launched its news department with the debut of a nightly half-hour 10:00 p.m. newscast, which was the second in the market after a short-lived attempt on WHCT-TV (channel 18, now Univision affiliate WUVN) in 1969; original WTIC news anchor Pat Sheehan had previously served as the anchor for WHCT's program. The 10:00 p.m. newscast was joined in June 1995 by an in-depth news program at 10:30 p.m. similar in style to the original format of \"Nightline\" called \"Tonight in Connecticut\"; after two months of low ratings, \"Tonight in Connecticut\" was dropped in August 1995 in favor of a half-hour extension of the existing 10:00 p.m. newscast. In 1998, when WTIC replaced WVIT as WTXX's LMA partner, the WVIT-produced 10:00 p.m. broadcast was replaced with a simulcast of the first half-hour of channel 61's primetime newscast. On April 24, 2006, WTXX began to simulcast the entire hour of the program. That station did not have a separate news open for the nightly broadcasts; whenever Fox programming or sports delayed the news on WTIC, it was still aired on WTXX but under the name of \"News at Ten\". There was also a \"News at Ten\" logo bug in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen in place of the \"Fox 61 News\" bug. WTXX discontinued its simulcast of the 10:00 p.m. newscast in June 2010, shortly before changing its callsign to WCCT-TV; that station continues to show the newscast when it is preempted on WTIC.\n\nThe station launched a weekday morning newscast on March 3, 2008. The 7:00 a.m. hour competes with WCTX's morning show (which is produced by sister station WTNH), and airs for one hour. On August 4, 2009, the weekday morning newscast was expanded to 4½ hours and began airing from 4:30 a.m. - 9:00 a.m. During the 8:00 a.m. hour, the format of the program includes several interview segments focusing on entertainment, lifestyle and health. This hour is simulcast on WCCT; the station's simulcasts of portions of the morning newscast have been intermittent throughout the newscast's existence. Since launching the morning broadcast, WTIC-TV has entered into a weather department partnership with WTIC radio (1080 AM). The weather center now features meteorologists from the radio and television stations. Weather reports can also be heard on WTIC, WTIC-FM (96.5 FM), WRCH (100.5 FM), WZMX (93.7 FM), and WZBG (97.3 FM).\n\nOn September 8, 2008, WTIC debuted a weeknight 11:00 p.m. newscast. On September 21, the station launched a weekday midday newscast at 11:00 a.m. A weeknight 6:00 p.m. newscast was planned, but did not debut on that date. On August 23, 2010, WTIC launched an hour-long late afternoon newscast at 4:00 p.m. on weekdays.\n\nIn July 2009, news reporter Shelly Sindland filed both state and federal complaints alleging age and sex discrimination in the station's newsroom. Media websites also raised questions about the way the case was covered by the \"Hartford Courant\", which operates under the same management as WTIC.\n\nOn December 12, 2009, WTIC, WCCT (then WTXX) and the \"Hartford Courant\" moved into their new combined newsroom facilities in Downtown Hartford, and WTIC rebranded from \"Fox 61\" to \"Fox CT\" (a transition that was completed in July 2010). In addition, WTIC became the second station in the market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition, with WCCT's newscasts also making the transition. On January 22, 2011, WTIC launched weekend morning newscasts, airing for two hours from 7:00 a.m. - 9:00 a.m.; it is the third Tribune-owned station with a weekend morning newscast (now-independent station and Tribune flagship WGN-TV in Chicago and Fox affiliate WXIN in Indianapolis debuted weekend morning newscasts before WTIC, CW affiliate KTLA in Los Angeles launched a weekend morning newscast a few months later in April 2011). On September 26, 2011, WTIC expanded its weekday morning newscast to 5½ hours from 4:30 a.m. -10:00 a.m.; with the expansion, the 11:00 a.m. newscast was dropped from the schedule. On January 28, 2013, WTIC launched an hour-long 5:00 p.m. newscast. On September 9, 2013, WTIC expanded its weekday morning newscast to six hours with the addition of a half-hour, now starting at 4:00 a.m. At some point afterwards, the weekend morning news was also expanded, this time by an hour and it now airs from 6:00 a.m. -9:00 a.m.\n\n\n \n"}

Calvin Crest was established by the San Joaquin Presbytery of California in 1954.\n\nThe Miwok Indians were the first people to live in the area of the Calvin Crest grounds, during the warm months and moving to the foothills and valley during the winter.\n\nIn 1873 the California Lumber Company set up operations near here and built a flume which sent lumber to Madera. Completed in 1876, the flume was 53 miles (85 km) long. By 1907, 35 million board feet (82,000 m³) were shipped each year. Much of the timber industry was shut down with the Great Depression of the 1930s. Remnants of the industry can be seen in the old narrow gauge railroad ties and the stumps of the giant sequoia that were left behind.\n\nHills Speckerman, a German immigrant, homesteaded the Calvin Crest area. His first cabin was located by the current Maintenance parking lot where he planted the first apple trees, grew potatoes and bred pigs and dogs. After his cabin burned to the ground, he moved to the area known as Speckerman's Meadow. Following his death in 1909 at the approximate age of 90 years, the land reverted to the government for back taxes.\n\nJohn Nelder, a hermit living in the area among the giant sequoia, was visited by the naturalist, John Muir in what is now Nelder Grove which sits adjacent to Calvin Crest.\n\nA man named Darnold owned the property after Speckerman and he built the original Ranch House. Later, Dr. Clarence Wells homesteaded and then traded for an additional 300 acres (1.2 km²). Working as a physician to the lumber companies, Dr. Wells expanded the Ranch as well as enlarged the apple orchard and planted roses and other exotic plants.\n\nIn the early fifties, the San Joaquin Presbytery began looking for a property to purchase to establish a camping program. They had been renting the YMCA camp at Lake Sequoia. After some searching, they learned the property of Dr. Wells was for sale. The presbytery voted to purchase the 340 acres (1.4 km²) in December 1954 with the price tag of $86,000. The summer of 1955 brought the first campers to Calvin Crest. There were two one-week sessions where the campers slept on the ground in the apple orchard and swam in Bass Lake. There were 65 campers and the annual budget was $25.\n\nIn 1956, the first major building phase began when construction started on the Dining Hall and the swimming pool.\n\nCalvin Crest designs and hosts Christian camping programs throughout the summer season. Programs are designed for third grade students through recent high-school graduates, as well as family camping programs. Calvin Crest offers High School Camp, Junior High Camp, Sherwood Camp (Third- Fifth Graders), Outdoor Adventure, and AIM (Assistants in Mission). Each program is organized and run by the Calvin Crest Summer Staff.\n\nAmong several recreational activities, Calvin Crest offers: boating, hiking, swimming, fishing, rock climbing, arts and crafts, and a ropes course.\n\nFrom September to the late Spring, Calvin Crest hosts an Outdoor education program designed and taught by the Calvin Crest Outdoor Education staff. These programs are designed for fifth or sixth grade students.\n"}
{"id": "2147102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147102", "title": "Portastudio", "text": "Portastudio\n\nThe TASCAM Portastudio was the world's first four-track recorder based on a standard compact audio cassette tape. The term \"portastudio\" is exclusive to TASCAM, though it is generally used to describe all self-contained cassette-based multitrack recorders dedicated to music production. The Portastudio, and particularly its first iteration, the Teac 144, is credited with launching the home-recording wave, which allowed musicians to cheaply record and produce music at home, and is cited as one of the most significant innovations in music production technology.\n\nThe Teac 144 Portastudio made its debut in 1979, at the annual meeting of the Audio Engineering Society. It was followed by several other models by TASCAM, and eventually by several other manufacturers.\n\nFor the first time it enabled musicians to affordably record several instrumental and vocal parts on different tracks of the built-in four-track cassette recorder individually and later blend all the parts together, while transferring them to another standard, two-channel stereo tape deck (remix and mixdown) to form a stereo recording.\n\nThe Tascam Portastudio 244, introduced in 1982, improved upon the previous design with overall better sound quality and more features, including: dbx noise reduction, dual/concentric sweepable EQ's, and the ability to record on up to 4 tracks simultaneously. \n\nIn general, these machines were typically used by musicians to record demos, although they are still used today in lo-fi recording. The analog portastudios by TASCAM (a division of TEAC) and similar units by Fostex, Akai, Yamaha, Sansui, Marantz, Vestax, Vesta Fire, TOA, Audio-Technica, Peavey, and others generally recorded on high-bias cassette tapes. Most of the machines were four-track, but there were also six-track and eight-track units. Some newer digital models record to a hard disk, allowing for digital effects and up to 32 tracks of audio.\n\nThe Portastudio supported the bouncing of content between tracks, such as creating a mix of three tracks and recording the sum onto the fourth track. By carefully balancing the volume and equalization, this could be done multiple times to create very lush tracks, reminiscent of the complex four-track production of late-sixties Beatle compositions. A limitation was the introduction of tape hiss, which was a particular issue with early models. This was eliminated with more recent digital models.\n\nUnlike standard audio cassette machines that recorded a pair of stereo channels per side, the cassette-based Portastudios recorded four channels in one direction. If you played back a standard two-sided stereo cassette, the second two channels would play in reverse. One interesting (but unpublished) feature was that you could record a track in reverse by flipping the cassette, then flip it back and record additional material. Thanks to the speed control, it was also possible to create a classic flanging effect by recording one track, then recording a second copy of the same track while varying the pitch control, creating a sweeping sound at points where the two tracks converged.\n\nAn additional feature was support for external signal processing during recording and on final output.\n\n\n\n"}

Named in honour of Saint Edmund Campion, Campion College offers a Bachelor of Arts in the Liberal Arts and welcomed its first intake of students in February 2006. The founding president was bioethicist Father John Fleming, and the first graduation ceremony was held in December 2008.\n\nCampion offers a Bachelor of Arts in the Liberal Arts as its sole undergraduate degree. The key disciplines are history, literature, philosophy and theology. The program is structured (loosely) chronologically: with students studying the ancient world in first year, the Middle Ages and Enlightenment in second and finishing with modernity and postmodernity in the third and final year. Students may opt to complete a major in any of the four disciplines. Students are also required to complete two science subjects in their final year. They may also elect to study Latin and Greek above their normal study load. The focus of this course is the development of Western culture. The Campion program offers an integrated approach to study. Individual units are not taught in isolation, but as part of the broader framework of the development of Western culture.\n\nCampion College is classed as a Non-Self-Accrediting Institution. Its registration as an institution, and accreditation of courses, are completed through the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA). Accreditation is completed in accordance with the Australian Qualifications Framework. Approval was granted by NSW Department of Education & Training in April 2006 to enrol international students in the Bachelor of Arts. The college is also approved by the Australian Government as a Higher Education provider and as such, eligible students have access to FEE-HELP loans for tuition fees. The college plans to introduce postgraduate education through a Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma and a Master of Arts in the Liberal Arts. In 2011, the college had an external quality audit by the Australian Universities Quality Agency (AUQA), with commendations received in relation to the academic and quality culture that have been established.\n\nIn 2011, the college established the Centre for the Study of Western Tradition to encourage critical reflection and research on the history, literature, languages, philosophy and theology that characterise Western civilisation and culture, in order to raise the profile of these vital disciplines in Australian tertiary education. The Centre holds conferences and symposia relating to its central research themes.\n\nIn its first year of operation, the college's intake was 16 students. Since then, new enrollments have averaged 20–30 per year, for a total student body of around 80. A total of 78 students were enrolled in 2017. A total of 77 students were enrolled in 2018.\n\nCampion College publishes a quarterly newsletter, \"Campion's Brag\". The Campion College Student Association (CCSA) publishes a quarterly magazine called \"The Sextant\".\n\nThe college's campus and grounds had been a Marist Fathers seminary which was dedicated to, and at one time held relics of, Saint Peter Chanel. The campus houses a chapel, library, accommodation, lecture and tutorial rooms, kitchens, and student areas. In 2018, the college constructed two new residential houses on-site, providing accommodation for an additional 34 students.\n\n"}

His early education was acquired in the public schools and in printing offices at Albia, Iowa and Des Moines, Iowa. His first business establishment was a newspaper in Atlantic, Iowa, which he named the \"Telegraph\".\n\nIn 1873, he was elected as a Republican to a seat in the Iowa State Senate representing Adair, Cass, Adams and Union counties, and was re-elected in 1877, and (after a six-year absence) in 1885. In all, he served in the Iowa Senate from 1874 to 1880, and 1886 to 1888.\n\nIn 1890 Young moved to Des Moines and purchased a daily newspaper known as the \"Daily Iowa Capital\" or (after 1901) the \"Des Moines Capital\". In 1893, Young was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor of Iowa, losing to Frank D. Jackson. He served as a war correspondent during the Spanish–American War.\n\nWhen Iowa Senator Jonathan P. Dolliver died suddenly in October 1910, Young was appointed by Iowa Governor Beryl F. Carroll as Dolliver's immediate replacement. Soon after his appointment, his position was up for election in the 1911 Iowa General Assembly, where the Republicans held a large majority but were deeply divided among a long list of candidates for Young's seat. The inability of any candidate to receive the required majority of 76 legislators forced the General Assembly to re-vote each morning of the session. Young was the principal Republican opponent of Fort Dodge attorney William S. Kenyon until the 23rd ballot, when Young lost most of his support to other candidates. Kenyon was ultimately elected on the final day of the session on the 67th ballot. In all, Young served in the U.S. Senate from November 1910 to April 1911.\n\nAfter his Senate service, Young returned to Des Moines and his newspaper. He again became a war correspondent, travelling to southeastern Europe in 1913 to cover the Second Balkan War. In 1915, he again returned to Europe, this time to assess the early stages of World War I (before the United States' entry). During that trip he was detained in Innsbruck by Austria-Hungary, but was later released.\n\nAfter the United States declared war in 1917, he was appointed chairman of the Iowa State Council for Defense. As the Council's chairman, Young urged that \"disloyal\" persons should be impoverished and imprisoned, arguing that \"[a]ny man who has lived under the protection of our laws and has accumulated wealth and is now disloyal should be deprived of every dollar he possesses and he should be interned in a stockade until the end of the war and at that time his fate should be considered carefully.\" He also campaigned against the teaching of any foreign language in any public school or college, and for the imposition of English literacy tests for voting.\n\nIn recognition of his work in raising funds in Iowa for the children of Belgium, Young was made a Knight of the Order of Leopold II of Belgium. He continued to edit his newspaper until his death in Des Moines on November 15, 1926. He was interred there in Woodland Cemetery.\n\n"}

It was also used in sister publication \"R&R\", which listed the chart as Urban National Airplay. The chart is not the R&B/hip-hop subset of the Hot 100 Airplay chart, but rather uses a separate panel of R&B stations in urban and urban adult contemporary markets. It was the primary airplay component chart of the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart until the issue dated October 20, 2012, when Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs was revamped to include digital sales, streaming, and airplay from all radio formats. The Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart encompasses two separate airplay charts, both of which are based on radio spins rather than audience impressions: Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop and Adult R&B Airplay, which measure airplay on urban contemporary and urban adult contemporary stations respectively.\n\nThere are fifty positions on the chart, which is solely based on radio airplay. 77 R&B and hip-hop radio stations are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems. Songs are ranked by a calculation of the total number of spins per week with its audience impression, which is based upon exact times of airplay and each station's Arbitron listener data.\n\nSongs receiving the greatest growth will receive a \"bullet\", although there are tracks that will also get bullets if the loss in detections does not exceed the percentage of downtime from a monitored station. \"Airpower\" awards are issued to songs that appear on the top 20 of both the airplay and audience chart for the first time, while the \"greatest gainer\" award is given to song with the largest increase in detections. A song with six or more spins in its first week is awarded an \"airplay add\". If a song is tied for the most spins in the same week, the one with the biggest increase that previous week will rank higher, but if both songs show the same amount of spins regardless of detection the song that is being played at more stations is ranked higher. Songs that fall below the top 20 and have been on the chart after 26 weeks are removed and go to recurrent status.\n\n▪ 22 weeks: Miguel — \"Adorn\"\n\n▪ 18 weeks: Lil Wayne — \"Motivation\" (Kelly Rowland featuring Lil Wayne) (7 weeks) → \"I'm On One\" (DJ Khaled featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne) (11 weeks)\n\n▪ 20 weeks: Cardi B — \"Money\" (9 weeks) → \"Please Me\" Cardi B and Bruno Mars) (11 weeks)\n\n▪ 17 weeks: Alicia Keys — \"No One\" (10 weeks) → Like You'll Never See Me Again\" (7 weeks)\n\nSource:\n\n65, Drake\n\n47, Chris Brown\n\n47, Lil Wayne\n\n35, Jay-Z\n\n32, R.

Harding one month after the United States entered World War I, and was disbanded soon after the end of the war. It became a focal point of various political battles conducted in the name of loyalty and Americanism. \n\nIts original mission was to \"assist in working out the plan for conscription in Iowa and on other war measures as required from time to time by the government.\" Unlike its counterpart in Minnesota (the Minnesota Commission of Public Safety), the Council was officially an advisory body with no formally delegated powers. Governor Harding refused the Council's request that he convene a special session of the Iowa General Assembly to grant the Council legal standing and money to spend. \n\nIts history was short, but stormy. The \"Des Moines Daily News\" reported that \"[t]he meetings of the council were irregular, infrequent and always\nstar chamber proceedings. . . . From the beginning, dissension featured the meetings, and long before the close of the war one-half of the membership ceased to attend the sessions.\" One of the Council's members, \"Iowa Homestead\" editor James M. Pierce, accused his colleagues on the Council of conducting a \"reign of terror\" to drive the Nonpartisan League from Iowa.\n\nTo chair the Council, Governor Harding chose Lafayette Young, the editor and publisher of \"The Des Moines Capital.\" Young had been appointed as an interim U.S. Senator in November 1910 immediately upon the death of Senator Jonathan Dolliver, but was defeated by William Squire Kenyon in the special legislative election in the Iowa General Assembly the following April.\n\nAs the Council's chairman, Young urged that \"disloyal\" persons should be impoverished and imprisoned, arguing that \"[a]ny man who has lived under the protection of our laws and has accumulated wealth and is now disloyal should be deprived of every dollar he possesses and he should be interned in a stockade until the end of the war and at that time his fate should be considered carefully.\" He also campaigned against the teaching of any foreign language in any public school or college, and for the imposition of English literacy tests for voting.\n\nIn May 1917, the Council approved the official state flag of Iowa, designed by Dixie Cornell Gebhardt, so that Iowa regiments could have a flag of their own in addition to the American flag.\n\nThe Council disbanded in January 1919, two months after the end of the war.\n"}

He gave allegiance to Abu Bakr.\n\nAfter the Invasion of Banu Mustaliq 'Abdullāh ibn ‘Ubayy, who was referred to as the head of the \"Hypocrites\" (\"munāfiqūn\"), was furious for the challenge which the Muslims showed towards the hostile plans and intrigues woven behind closed doors, and swore \"the most honourable will expel the meanest out of Madinah,\" and added: \"They (the Muslims) have outnumbered and shared us our land. If you fatten your dog, it will eat you.\" Zayd ibn Arqam narrated this to the Prophet who then asked for Abdullāh ibn ‘Ubayy's presence. ibn ‘Ubayy swore oaths denying he had stated something like this and because of this he was let go. But later on the testimony of Zayd ibn Arqam was verified by the revelation of Surah Al-Munāfiqūn.\n\nThe event of Muhammad saying\"I leave you behind 2 things and if you follow them;you'll never go astray!The book of Allah & My family!\" When Zaid was older, he retold the hadith of the two weighty things, during the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate.

Zayd Bin Arqam, an old Companion of the Prophet present in the court, not aware of what had happened, recognized Al-Hussein’s face. Stricken by shock and grief, he shouted to Ibn Ziyad: “Remove your cane off this face! By God, how many times have I seen the Prophet kissing this face”, and he burst into tears. Ibn Ziyad was livid with rage. He retorted: “Ibn Ziyad (Ubaydallah) said, “May God make your eyes weep, for by God, if it were not for the fact that you are an old man, who has become silly and your mind has left you, I would cut off your head”.

{"id": "2147125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147125", "title": "Bennie Oosterbaan", "text": "Bennie Oosterbaan\n\nBenjamin Oosterbaan ( ; February 24, 1906 – October 25, 1990) was a three-time first team All-American football end for the Michigan Wolverines football team, two-time All-American basketball player for the basketball team, and an All-Big Ten Conference baseball player for the baseball team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest football players in Michigan history. He was selected by \"Sports Illustrated\" as the fourth greatest athlete in the history of the U.S. state of Michigan in 2003 and one of the eleven greatest college football players of the first century of the game (ending in 1968).\n\nDuring his collegiate athletic career he was a Big Ten batting champion in baseball, Big Ten scoring champion in basketball, and Big Ten touchdown leader in football. He was the first University of Michigan athlete to become a first-team All-American in basketball and the first three-time first-team football All-American. In high school, he had been an All-American basketball player, a state champion in track and field, and an All-state player in baseball and football. In addition to his All-American collegiate performances as an end, Oosterbaan threw three touchdown passes in the dedication game of Michigan Stadium.\n\nAfter his playing career ended, Oosterbaan spent several decades working for the University of Michigan Athletic Department until the 1970s. Oosterbaan served as the football, basketball, and baseball coach for the University. Oosterbaan's 1948 Michigan Wolverines football team won an Associated Press national championship, and his 1950 squad won the 1951 Rose Bowl. He later served as the director of athletic alumni relations.\n\nBorn in Muskegon, Michigan, Oosterbaan began his athletic career at Muskegon High School where he was selected by the \"Detroit News\" as an All-State end. In his junior year (1923), he led the Muskegon basketball team to a state championship and was named a High School All-American in basketball. He was also an All-State baseball player and state champion discus thrower. According to a \"Michigan Today\" article, he probably could have made the 1928 Summer Olympics team in the discus.\n\nAt Michigan, Bennie Oosterbaan earned nine letters—three apiece in football, basketball, and baseball. In its obituary of Oosterbaan, \"The Sporting News\" described him as a phenomenal student-athlete who in his senior year at Michigan \"was captain of the football team, led the Big Ten Conference in scoring in basketball and was the league's leading hitter in baseball, a sport he had not pursued while in high school.\"\n\nOosterbaan was both a scholar and an athlete. In 1928, he was awarded the Western Conference Medal of Honor for proficiency as a scholar-athlete. That season, he was captain, most valuable player, and an All-American in football; Big Ten scoring champion and All-American in basketball; and Big Ten batting average champion in what may be the most dominant three sport performance in any conference in a single year.\n\nAfter a year on the freshmen football team, he was invited to varsity tryouts. A star receiver and defensive end in a time when the forward pass was still evolving, Oosterbaan united with quarterback Benny Friedman as a passing combination. As a sophomore in 1925, Oosterbaan led the Big Ten with eight touchdowns. That year, the Wolverines outscored their opponents 227–3. The team shut out every team they faced, except a 3–2 defeat to Northwestern at Soldier Field late in the season. Oosterbaan's defensive play was outstanding as well, and he was key in shutting out the Fighting Illini and Red Grange 3–0 in 1925 a year after he scored four touchdowns in the first twelve minutes. Five players from the 1925 team were named All-Americans, including Benny Friedman and Oosterbaan. He was briefly kicked off of the team during the year by an assistant coach for lining up incorrectly before coach Fielding H. Yost brought him back.\n\nIn 1926, Friedman and Oosterbaan were both named All-Americans after leading the Wolverines to a 7–1 record and their second consecutive Big Ten Conference championship. That year, his 60-yard run with a recovered fumble helped Michigan to a 7–6 victory over Minnesota in the annual Little Brown Jug game. The Wolverines outscored their opponents, 191–38, and suffered their only loss to Navy, 10–0, in front of 80,000 fans at Baltimore Stadium.\n\nThe following year, Friedman had moved on to the NFL, and Oosterbaan was named the team's captain and Most Valuable Player. Oosterbaan was a skilled passer, once throwing for three touchdowns passes in the Michigan Stadium dedication game against rival Ohio State University on October 22, 1927. Oosterbaan was also selected as an All-American for the third consecutive season. He is one of only two players at Michigan ever to receive consensus All-American honors three times—Anthony Carter being the other. The Wolverines went 20–4 in Oosterbaan's career at Michigan.\n\nIn addition to football, Oosterbaan was an All-American basketball forward. He led the Big Ten Conference in scoring (178 points) in his senior year. He was named All-American in both 1927 and 1928 and was a member of Michigan's first back-to-back Western conference champions under E. J. Mather during the 1925–26 and 1926–27 seasons (the latter being Michigan's first outright champion and Oosterbaan's first basketball All-American selection). Oosterbaan was the first Michigan All-American in basketball. He twice recorded double-doubles in this low scoring era.\n\nOosterbaan was also an All-Conference baseball player who won the Big Ten batting title in 1927. He played both First baseman and pitcher.\n\nAfter graduating, Oosterbaan declined offers to play professional football and baseball. According to friend and player Ron Kramer, Oosterbaan grew up in the Dutch Reformed Church and did not sign a professional football or baseball contract \"because of his religious background and his mother. Dutch Reformed didn't play football on Sundays.\"\n\nInstead, Oosterbaan stayed on at the University of Michigan as an assistant coach for the football and basketball teams. He began as an assistant football coach immediately after graduating, and he remained an assistant coach of the football team for twenty years before succeeding Fritz Crisler. After serving 10 seasons as an assistant coach, he also became the head basketball coach in 1938 and served in that capacity until 1946. The basketball team had an 81–72 record while Oosterbaan was the head coach. Oosterbaan employed an uptempo style of play that differed from that of his predecessor Franklin Cappon. Oosterbaan was also head coach of the freshman baseball team.\nIn 1948, Oosterbaan took over as head coach of the football team at Michigan. Crisler named Oosterbaan as his successor after the 1948 Rose Bowl in which Michigan beat the USC Trojans by a score of 49–0. Crisler described Oosterbaan as \"the best offensive mind in college football.\" Oosterbaan led the Wolverines to an Associated Press (AP) national championship in his first season and won Coach of the Year honors. His 1950 team won the 1951 Rose Bowl after Oosterbaan obtained consent from the Conference to hold extra practices. His teams won Big Ten championships in each of his first three seasons but did not win another under his tenure. He coached at Michigan until 1958, compiling a 63–33–4 record. \n\nOosterbaan believed success was fleeting. He once was quoted in \"Time Magazine\" as saying, \"I'm on top now, and there is a lot of backslapping. But what of seasons to come? Let me lose the opener or a couple of other games next fall, and then watch how I'm blasted.\" As coach, he had a reputation as a mild-mannered man who aspired to live by the maxims of his own college football coach, Fielding Yost.\n\nOosterbaan had a mild-mannered coaching style. \"Poise\" was his favorite word when it came to inspiring his team. He coached without using a lot of yelling and screaming. Oosterbaan motivated his players without using sarcasm or losing his temper, and rarely used locker room pep talks.\n\nOosterbaan resigned as the head football coach in 1958. At the time, he said: \"The pressure finally got to me. Not the kind that comes from outside. Not from my bosses or the fans. I mean the pressure that builds up inside a head coach whether he wins or loses.\" After Oosterbaan quit as football coach he was succeeded by Bump Elliott. In 1959, Oosterbaan became Michigan's director of athletic alumni relations and held that position until he retired in 1972.\n\nOosterbaan died in 1990, having spent his entire career associated with the University of Michigan. As one of his obituaries noted, he \"went to Ann Arbor as a freshman in 1924—and never left.\" All-American Ron Kramer said of his former coach: \"Bennie Oosterbaan is the Michigan tradition. The man gave his whole life to Michigan.\" When he died he was the most recent Michigan football coach to have a team ranked #1 in the nation at the end of the season.\n\nOosterbaan's wife of 57 years, Delmas, had predeceased him a few months earlier on July 23. He was survived by his sister, Grace Hedner; his daughter, Anna Wilson; and two grandsons. Two of his brothers, Guy and Andy, died when Oosterbaan was a young man. Oosterbaan is no relation to John Paul Oosterbaan who was a member of the 1989 NCAA Championship basketball team. While at the University of Michigan he was a member of Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.\n\nDon Lund, Michigan's associate athletic director for alumni relations who also played basketball for Oosterbaan said: \"There's no question he was the greatest athlete we ever had here at Michigan.\" Ohio State Buckeyes football coach Woody Hayes once said of Oosterbaan: \"If he weren't from Michigan, I'd like to have my own son play for him.\"\n\nBennie Oosterbaan's jersey number 47 was the first Michigan football jersey number retired, and until 2011, it was one of only five numbers retired by the Michigan football program. In 2012, the Michigan Football Legends program led to the reissue of the No. 47 jersey to linebacker Jake Ryan, bearing a patch (pictured at right) honoring Oosterbaan. Each player to wear the jersey will also dress at a locker bearing a plaque with Oosterbaan's name and his time of tenure at Michigan.\n\nIn 1954, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He was a member of the fourth class of inductees into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1958. Oosterbaan was a member of the inaugural 1978 class of inductees into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. The Michigan football indoor practice facility was named Oosterbaan Field House. In 2000, he was selected to the Michigan All-Century team.\n\nAmerican sports-writer, Grantland Rice selected him and Don Hutson as the ends for the all-time All-American team of the first half of the 20th century. A poll of Michigan alumni and friends in 1979 selected Oosterbaan as Michigan's greatest all-time football player. In 1969, \"Sports Illustrated\" named him to the eleven-man All-Century team for the period 1869–1968.\n\nIn 1999, \"Sports Illustrated\" published a list of \"The 50 Greatest Sports Figures From Michigan\" (in all sports), and ranked Oosterbaan fourth on the list behind Joe Louis, Magic Johnson and Charlie Gehringer. He was the highest ranked football player, ahead of Michigan Wolverines Ron Kramer (#7), Fielding H. Yost (#9), Rick Leach (#22), Fritz Crisler (#31), and Harry Kipke (#40).\n\n\n"}

His mother was Um Ruman bint Amir ibn Uwaymir ibn Zuhal ibn Dahman and he was the full brother of Aisha. He and three other children of Abu Bakr namely Abdullah, Aisha and Asma were born sometime between 595 AD to 600 AD. It is said that he had a good sense of humour.\n\nUnlike the rest of his family, including his father Abu Bakr and sister Aisha, he did not convert to Islam until the Treaty of Hudaybiyah in 628 AD.\n\nFour generations of the family of Abdul-Rahman had the distinction of being the companions (sahaba) of the Prophet Muhammad namely Abdul-Rahman, his father Abu Bakr \"As-Siddiq\", his grandfather Uthman Abu Quhafa and his son Abu Atiq Muhammad. It was believed that no other family held this distinction.\n\nWhile still a non-Muslim, Abdul-Rahman fought from the side of Quraish in the Battles of Badr and Uhud.\n\nIn the Battle of Badr, he had an opportunity to kill his father, Abu Bakr, but he turned in another direction. Years later, after becoming Muslim, he told his father about it. Thereupon Abu Bakr replied: \"If I had had such an opportunity, I would not have spared \"you\".\"\n\nIn the Battle of Uhud before the fighting began, he came forward and threw down a challenge for a duel. Abu Bakr accepted the challenge, but Muhammad stopped him, saying, \"Sheathe your sword, and let us continue to profit by your wise counsels.\"\n\nAfter becoming a Muslim, Abdul-Rahman participated in all the battles fought by the Muslims and gained fame as a fierce warrior, especially in the Muslim conquest of Syria. He was one of the Mubarizun champions and fought duels in the battles for the Muslim army. The mubarizun unit of the Rashidun army was composed of elite warriors who were champion swordsmen, lancers and archers. In the battlefield his role was to undermine the morale of the enemy before the beginning of the battle by slaying their champions in duels.\n\nIn the Battle of Yamama he killed Muhakkam al-Yamama, the General commanding the forces of Musaylima.\n\nIn the Battle of Yarmouk, the Commander in chief of Byzantine force chose five selected warriors from Byzantine side, and they challenged the Muslims to duel. It was Abdul-Rahman who accepted the challenge. Scores of duels were fought on the plains of Yarmouk. Abdul-Rahman killed all of them one after the other.\n\nAt the Battle of Busra in Syria, he entered the city of Busra through a subterranean passage and then dashing towards the city gates opened them for the main Muslim army to enter.\n\nHe fought on the side of Ali ibn Abi Talib against his own sister Aisha bint Abi Bakr at the Battle of the Camel in 656 AD.\n\nAfter his death, he was buried in Mecca. .\n\nAbdul-Rahman is the ancestor of many Albakri Al-Siddiqi families: the Al Atiqi found in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq, and Siddiqui and Quraishi families in South and Central Asia. In the Horn of Africa, they are known as the Sheekhaal or Fiqi Umar family in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya.\n\n"}
{"id": "2147145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147145", "title": "Wiebo Ludwig", "text": "Wiebo Ludwig\n\nWiebo Arienes Ludwig (19 December 1941 – 9 April 2012) was the leader of a Christian community named Trickle Creek, just outside Hythe, Alberta, Canada. He was best known for his legal problems arising from his conflict with the oil and gas industry. He was convicted in R v Ludwig [2000] AJ v509 at 293 on several counts (see infra) for sabotaging oil and gas wells. From the early 1990s until the time that he died, Ludwig consistently accused the industry of poisoning his family and farm through their attempts to extract toxic sour gas from the Peace River region of Alberta.\n\nLudwig was born during World War II and emigrated to Canada with his family from Friesland in the northern part of the Netherlands shortly after the war. He had seven older siblings. The family maintained strong religious beliefs and most kept ties with the Dutch Reformed Church or held some form of Baptist beliefs. In his early life, Ludwig worked as a carpenter and as a drywaller. He later studied pastoral ministry at Iowa's Dordt College which is associated with the Christian Reformed Church. While studying at Dordt, Wiebo met his future wife, Mamie, with whom he later had eleven children. Ludwig completed his pastoral education at the Calvin Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nAfter Ludwig completed his pastoral education, his initial application for ordination was rejected, possibly because his leadership style was perceived as being too authoritarian. He successfully appealed the decision and went on to lead two churches in Goderich, Ontario. Ludwig's leadership of the churches was controversial. In 1985, he led a group (His wife, their kids with another married couple and their children.) of his supporters to settle in a remote farming community near Hythe, Alberta, approximately 500 km northwest of the provincial capital of Edmonton. The small farming community started with a quarter section (160 acres), eventually added another, and grew into a self-sustaining community. The property contains several dozen buildings, including a biodiesel refinery, a greenhouse, and a mill. After the addition of windmills and solar panels, the community became capable of generating its own power, and a large computer-controlled boiler generates heat for the community's houses. Ludwig named the community \"Trickle Creek\".\n\nIn 1985, there was only one sour gas well within a 2-mile radius of Trickle Creek; in the intervening 15 years, there were at least 10.\n\nIn the early 1990s, oil companies in northern Alberta began building sour gas wells on land they owned near Trickle Creek. Ludwig believed he had linked the flared hydrogen sulfide sour gas and leaks from the wells with stillbirths, deformations, and miscarriages that began to occur in the community at the time, and began to protest sour gas development near his community. He appealed to both levels (eg.) of government to regulate sour gas extraction near the community, but the government did not respond. Ludwig then produced a video titled \"Home Sour Home\" in order to gain broader attention. In an effort to gain the attention of the government he appeared at the government offices of Grande Prairie and poured sour crude oil on the lobby carpet. His appeals for government intervention were not successful.\n\nLatterly, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has acknowledged that\n\"hydrogen sulfide in the air is an irritant and a chemical asphyxiant that can alter both oxygen utilization and the (human) central nervous system\". In 2013, Enbridge won the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's permission to refuse delivery of any oil with hydrogen sulfide that exceeded 5 parts per million, half the maximum exposure recommended by federal regulators, finding levels as high as 1,200 parts per million in some crude oil shipments from Bakken formation crude oil.\n\nThere were hundreds of acts of vandalism against natural gas sites across northern Alberta in the 1990s. Many of these attacks were against AEC West, the main company operating near Trickle Creek. The company negotiated with Ludwig in an attempt to buy his farm; but, two days after these negotiations failed, two of its wells 30 km from the farm were destroyed by explosions. A few days after these explosions, Ludwig stated: \"If the oil companies run roughshod over your lives, you have to take defensive action against them, whatever is necessary... You can't just let them kill your children.\"\n\nIn 1998 the RCMP charged Ludwig for an attack on a Suncor well that occurred days after one of Ludwig's grandchildren was delivered stillborn. At a January 1999 bail hearing, the lawyer for Ludwig and another defendant revealed that RCMP officers had bombed an oil installation as part of a dirty tricks campaign during their investigation of acts against oil industry installations. The information was confirmed by crown prosecutors.\n\nIn April 2000 Ludwig was convicted and sentenced to 28 months in jail. He was convicted of five offenses, including blowing up one well, vandalizing another by pouring concrete into it, and counseling an undercover police officer to buy dynamite. In October 2000 he attempted to run for the leadership of the Alberta Social Credit Party, but was forced to withdraw from the leadership contest after a judge refused to waive the conditions of his bail. He served time at a minimum security prison in Grande Cache, and was eventually released after only 19 months. He maintained his innocence after being released.\n\nA teenage girl, Karman Willis, was killed in Trickle Creek in an incident that occurred in 1999 when \na pickup truck full of adolescents trespassed on the Trickle Creek farm. Some residents of the farm, who were camping in the path of the truck, feared for their safety, and an unidentified person shot at the truck.\nLudwig called 911, explaining to the operator that shots had been fired. The subsequent police investigation suggested that the bullet hit the bottom of the truck, then ricocheted up and hit Willis in the chest. A bullet also hit a second teen in the arm, but he survived. Police were never able to identify the shooter, and were not able to recover the weapon. No one was ever charged with the death, and local residents still refer to the exact nature of events that happened on the night of the shooting as \"a mystery\".\n\nOn 11 February 2000, 18 charges were laid against Ludwig and Boonstra. Of these charges, on 20 April Judge Sanderman found that Ludwig had\nand sentenced him to 28 months in jail. At the time in Canada, sentences of over 24 months required that time be spent in a Federal penitentiary. Boonstra was sentenced to 21 days.\n\nAfter being released from prison Ludwig largely faded from media attention. In 2002 journalist Andrew Nikiforuk wrote a book on Ludwig, \"Saboteurs: Wiebo Ludwig's War Against Big Oil\". In 2003 a made-for-TV movie was produced, \"Burn: The Robert Wraight Story\", which was based on the life of an informant who had cooperated with the RCMP to provide evidence supporting Ludwig's conviction.\n\nIn 2008, a series of letters threatening local gas companies was anonymously sent to the \"Dawson Creek Daily News and Coffee Talk Express\" in Chetwynd, B.C.. The letters threatened Encana to cease its operations near the small town of Tomslake, B.C., just south of Dawson Creek, and close to Trickle Creek. Following these letters local pipelines were hit by six explosions. Because these explosions were similar to other acts of vandalism which had occurred around Ludwig's farm, police suspected his involvement. Following the bombings Encana offered a reward of up to a million dollars for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the bomber. In September 2009 Ludwig wrote an open letter to the bomber(s) supporting their cause but encouraging them to stop their bombings.\n\nAfter forensics experts found Ludwig's DNA on two of the letters, Police arrested Ludwig in 2010 at a Super 8 Motel in Grande Prairie, where Ludwig had been invited on the pretext of helping with the investigation. After arresting Ludwig the RCMP then conducted a four-day search of Trickle Creek involving over a hundred RCMP officers. The RCMP found evidence which they believed was incriminating during the search, including potassium nitrate (an explosive chemical), 75 grams of marijuana, some chemistry books, handwritten notes which police believed detailed the location of hidden weapons, and notebooks full of information on Dawson Creek, the Canadian government, oil pipelines, and the oil and gas industry. Ludwig explained that the potassium nitrate was for toy rockets, that the marijuana was an anaesthetic, and that the chemistry texts were for homeschooling the community's children. A book on property terrorism was also found on Ludwig's nightstand, but Ludwig explained that it had been a gift. Ludwig was held in custody for a day. He was told that he would be charged with extortion, but was eventually released without being charged.\n\nLudwig was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 2011. He used an alternative medicine regimen that included injections of vitamin C and hydrogen peroxide. He also received conventional pain relievers and a stent in his throat enabling him to swallow. In the same year Ludwig was also the subject of a documentary, \"Wiebo's War\", which treated his life and conflict with the oil and gas industry sympathetically. In February 2012, Ludwig built his own coffin, and he did his final media interview with journalist Byron Christopher.\n\nLudwig died two months later, on April 9, in his log cabin. His last words were a request that his family not quarrel, and that they keep their faith. He was buried almost immediately in an above-ground crypt in a forest near his home. The funeral ceremony was private. The day after Ludwig died, RCMP officers asked his family if they could open Ludwig's coffin to take his body's fingerprints in order to verify his death, but Ludwig's family refused, calling the request \"'odd,' 'invasive' and 'a terrible disrespect and interference' with human remains\". RCMP officers explained that it is common for police to take fingerprints from a recently deceased person if that person has a criminal record, but third-party experts disputed this claim.\n\n\n"}

The plan was for the government to buy the wheat and then store it or export it at a loss. It was co-authored by Charles L. McNary (R-Oregon) and Gilbert N. Haugen (R-Iowa). Despite attempts in 1924, 1926, 1927, and 1931 to pass the bill, it was vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge, and not approved. It was supported by Secretary of Agriculture Henry Cantwell Wallace and Vice President Charles Dawes.\n\nAccording to the bill, a federal agency would be created to support and protect domestic farm prices by attempting to maintain price levels that existed before the First World War. By purchasing surpluses and selling them overseas, the federal government would take losses that would be paid for through fees against farm producers.\n\nThe war had created an atmosphere of high prices for agricultural products as European nations demand for exports surged. Farmers had enjoyed a period of prosperity as US farm production expanded rapidly to fill the gap left as European belligerents found themselves unable to produce enough food. When the war ended, supply increased rapidly as Europe's agricultural market rebounded.\n\nOverproduction led to plummeting prices which led to stagnant market conditions and living standards for farmers in the 1920s. Worse, hundreds of thousands of farmers had taken out mortgages and loans to buy new equipment and land to expand and were now unable to meet the financial burden. The cause was the collapse of land prices after the wartime bubble when farmers used high prices to buy up neighboring farms at high prices, saddling them with heavy debts. Farmers, however, blamed the decline of foreign markets and the effects of the protective tariff. They demanded relief as the agricultural depression grew steadily worse in the middle 1920s while the rest of the economy flourished. Instability in the agricultural marketplace in the mid-1920s kept the bill afloat, along with other plans for government-implemented price and wage controls in various industries.\n\nA plan suggested by George Peek and Hugh S. Johnson, of the Moline Plow Company, called for new tariffs to protect farmers from foreign producers and a federal program for price supports. Wallace and Henry C. Taylor, head of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, rallied behind the plan, which formed the basis for the bill introduced by McNary of Oregon and Representative Haugen of Iowa, both Republicans. The basic idea of the bill was an equalization fee. The government was to segregate the amounts required for domestic consumption from the exportable surplus. The former were to be sold at the higher domestic price (the world price plus the tariff), using the full advantage of the tariff rates on exportable farm products, and the latter at the world price. The difference between the higher domestic price and the world price received for the surplus was to be met by the farmers of each commodity in the form of a tax or equalization fee, which would be paid by American consumers in the form of higher food prices.\n\nThe legislation was before Congress from 1924 to 1928. It received powerful and united support from agricultural interests in 1927 and in 1928, respectively, when it passed both houses. Gleason (1958) shows that most leading businessmen opposed the bill on the grounds that it was contrary to economic law and would cost money and involve the government in business. Farmers were urged to reduce production, practice crop diversification, and support the cooperative movement. The plan was opposed also on the moral ground that it would destroy the farmer's self-reliance. \n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge listened to business and killed the bill twice with vigorous vetoes. Coolidge instead supported the alternative program of Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover and Agriculture Secretary William M. Jardine to modernize farming, by bringing in more electricity, more efficient equipment, better seeds and breeds, more rural education, and better business practices. Hoover advocated the creation of a Federal Farm Board, which was dedicated to restriction of crop production to domestic demand, behind a tariff wall, and he maintained that the farmer's ailments were because of defective distribution. Coolidge finally committed himself to a farm board plan for price stabilization by co-operatives. Rejecting the McNary–Haugen plan, so popular in Congress, the Hoover plan was adopted in 1929.\n\nAs president of Kansas State Agricultural College from 1918, Jardine developed a free-market program of education and co-operative marketing for Kansas farmers. His advice was increasingly sought in Washington and led in 1922 to the formation of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, meant to assist farm cooperatives. As Secretary of Agriculture after 1925, after the death of Wallace, Jardine made proposals that offered relief for farmers but preserved a free market, which led to Hoover's Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929, too far into the worsening farm crisis to succeed after the onset of the Great Depression.\n\nHenry Agard Wallace, the son of the elder Wallace, was furious over Coolidge's vetoes of the McNary–Haugen Bill and supported Alfred E. Smith against Hoover for the presidency in 1928. He was pleased by enactment of the Agricultural Marketing Act in the Hoover administration but cited its lack of provisions for checking overproduction, and he wrote hard-hitting editorials against the Hawley–Smoot Tariff, which passed in 1930. The younger Wallace established himself as the preeminent Farm Belt leader, wrote the major farm speech of the Franklin D. Roosevelt presidential campaign, and in 1933, he became Secretary of Agriculture in his father's footsteps.\n\nPorter (2000) follows the growth of activity among the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation (IFBF) membership and leadership on behalf of the legislation. It was the first farm organization to endorse the McNary–Haugen plan and also supported other groups working toward the plan's passage and paid the costs of sending its president, Charles E. Hearst, to Washington on extended lobbying trips. Though the legislation ultimately failed, twice in Congress and twice by presidential veto, the adoption of the idea by mainstream farm organizations laid the groundwork for farmer support of New Deal farm policy, where they applauded Roosevelt's appointment of Peek and Johnson, authors of the McNary–Haugen plan, as well as advocate Wallace Jr. to powerful positions, where they began large-scale subsidy programs.\n\n"}

Prior to those posts he served as Minister of War in 1923.\n\nCarmona was a republican and a freemason, and was a quick adherent to the proclamation of the Portuguese First Republic on 5 October 1910. He was, however, never a sympathizer of the democratic form of government and – as he would later confess in an interview to António Ferro – he only voted for the first time at the National Plebiscite of 1933. During the First Republic, he briefly served as War Minister in the government of António Ginestal Machado in 1923. Unlike the popular marshal Gomes da Costa, Carmona had not seen action in World War I.\n\nCarmona was very active in the 28th May coup d'état of 1926 that overthrew the First Republic. The first Council President, commandant José Mendes Cabeçadas, a democratic sympathizer supported by the last republican president, Bernardino Machado, was succeeded in June by Manuel de Oliveira Gomes da Costa. Carmona, who had been the Minister for Foreign Affairs between 3 June and 6 July, was the leader of the most conservative and authoritarian wing of the military regime, which considered the more moderate Gomes da Costa a liability. On 9 July, he led a countercoup together with general João José Sinel de Cordes, named himself President, and immediately assumed dictatorial powers. He was formally elected to the office in 1928, as the only candidate.\n\nIn 1928 Carmona appointed António de Oliveira Salazar as Minister of Finance. Impressed by Salazar's charisma and qualities, Carmona nominated Salazar as Prime Minister in 1932, and largely turned over control of the government to him.\n\nIn 1933, a new constitution officially established the \"Estado Novo\". On paper, the new document codified the dictatorial powers Carmona had exercised since 1928. However, in practice he was now little more than a figurehead; Salazar held the real power. On paper, the president's power to dismiss Salazar was the only check on his power. However, Carmona mostly allowed Salazar a free hand. He was reelected without opposition in 1935 and 1942 for seven-year terms. In 1935, he signed the law that forbade Freemasonry in Portugal reluctantly, due to his own Freemason past.\n\nAlthough the democratic opposition was allowed to contest elections after World War II, Carmona was not on friendly terms with it. When the opposition demanded that the elections be delayed in order to give them more time to organize, Carmona turned them down.\n\nHowever, there were widespread rumours that Carmona supported the failed military uprising in 1947, which was led by general José Marques Godinho to overthrow Salazar, under the condition that he would remain as President of the Republic. Probably to end these rumours, Carmona finally accepted the title of Marshal.\n\nIn 1949, Carmona, 79 years old, sought his fourth term as president. For the first time, he actually faced an opponent in General José Norton de Matos. However, after the regime refused to allow Matos to actually run a campaign, he pulled out of the race on 12 February, handing Carmona another term.\n\nCarmona died two years later, in 1951, after 24 years as the President of the Republic. He was buried in the Church of Santa Engrácia, National Pantheon, in Lisbon.\n\nHe was born to Alvaro Rosario Teixeira Carmona, a Portuguese Naval officer from Felgueiras, based in Brazil and part of the Portuguese Military Attache's staff in Brazil. In January 1914, Carmona married Maria do Carmo Ferreira da Silva (Chaves, 28 September 1878 – 13 March 1956), daughter of Germano da Silva and wife Engrácia de Jesus. With this marriage he legitimized their three children.\n\nHe is the grand-uncle of the former Mayor of Lisbon Carmona Rodrigues (2004–2007). He is also cousin of Brazilian President Augusto Tasso Fragoso.\n\n\nCarmona wrote a book of rules for the Cavalry School in 1913.\n\nThe town of Uíge, Angola, used to be called Carmona after him. It had that name until 1975, when the Portuguese Overseas Province of Angola became independent. He was also portrayed in the Angolan escudo banknote issue of 1972.\n"}

His narrative verse was highly popular in his lifetime.\n\nHe was born Thomas Robert Edward McInnes in Dresden, Ontario. He moved to New Westminster with his family in 1874, and grew up there. His father, Thomas Robert McInnes, served in the Senate of Canada from 1881 to 1897, and as Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia from 1897 until 1900.\n\nMacInnes was educated at University College, Toronto, graduating with a B.A. from the University of Toronto in 1887.\nHe studied law at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto, Ontario, and was called to the bar in 1893.\n\nMcInnes served as secretary to the Bering Sea Claims Commission in 1896 and 1897, and for part of 1897 was a member of the Yukon special police and customs force at Skagway. He acted as private secretary to his father, the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, from 1898 until 1900 (when the elder McInnes was dismissed from the office).\n\nHe was still spelling his surname \"McInnes\" as of 1916.\n\nMacInnes spent long periods in China, where he had business interests, between 1916 and 1927. One source says that he \"returned to Canada with a lifelong hatred of Communists and Chinese.\"\n\nMacInnes wrote a series of articles on his Chinese experiences, published in 1926 in the \"Vancouver Morning Star\" and \"Vancouver Province\", that became the basis of his 1927 book, \"Oriental Occupation of British Columbia\". According to more than one sources, the book proposes that British Columbia adopt apartheid-like policies in dealing with what MacInnes perceived to be an undesirable influx of Chinese immigrants. Another source, though, calls \"Oriental Occupation...\" \"a pamphlet,\" says that MacInnes had \"developed a sympathy for Orientals living in British Columbia,\" and says that the pamphlet reflects his \"views of British Columbia prejudice\" against Orientals.\n\nIn Vancouver, MacInnes joined the Canadian Union of Fascists. He became a leading activist in the fascist scene, founding the Nationalist League of Canada.\n\nMacInnes's poetry was popular in Canada in the first half of the 20th century. He wrote \"light, easy verse that dismissed smugness and respectability with unconcerned humour ... an amused detachment underlies his work, as though poetry were merely one form of expression, as good as any other.\" He believed \"that joy and delight, rather than the prevalent melancholic outpourings of the soul, were essential to poetry.\"\n\nMacInnes can be compared to Robert Service, not least in the fact of their popularity in Canada at the time. Like Service in his Yukon and war poems, MacInnes, \"was especially interested in examining man within a natural landscape, on the fringes of society.\" Also like Service, \"his rhythms are often forced and pedantic, his rhyme-schemes careless and rough.\"\n\nIn some ways MacInnes seems to have modeled his career on that of Service. His first published work, \"A Romance of the Lost\" (1908), is a long yarn in rhyme about the Klondike Gold Rush, in the manner of the poems in Service's 1907 breakthrough work, \"Songs of a Sourdough.\" In 1913 MacInnes released \"Rhymes of a Rounder,\" on the heels of Service's 1912 \"Rhymes of a Rolling Stone.\"\n\nUnlike Service, though, MacInnes \"was intrigued with elaborate poetic forms, such as the villanelle,\" and actually invented \"a five-line stanza of his own he called the ‘mirelle’.\"\n\nKatherine Hale, reviewing Macinnes's first book in \"The Mail and Empire\", pronounced that \"the best poem is 'The Damozel of Doom,' an eerie, dreamlike, passionate piece, suggested by the teaching of old Tao, who believed that there are regions where dead souls may be awakened by desires so strong that they are drawn outward again to Earth, where, through finer desires, they again pass into Paradise. Then 'the peace of a thousand years may be theirs in Limbo'... The coming of this desire, which shall ultimately free, or banish the soul to ages of 'utter vanishment' is depicted in 'The Damozel of Doom' – a poem worthy of the genius of Poe.\"\n\nJohn Garvin included three MacInnes poems, including \"The Damozel of Doom,\" in his 1916 anthology \"Canadian Poets,\" and wrote of MacInnes's poetry: \"Originality, constructive imagination, felicitous fancy, and delightful humour (if sometimes grim), combined with philosophic subtlety, much experience of life, and skilled artistry, are the outstanding qualities of this poet, so little known to Canadian readers, so worthy of their appreciation.\"\n\nIn a 1933 talk, on Canadian poets who had become known in the early 20th century, Charles G.D. Roberts said: \"Preeminent among these is Tom MacInnes, standing somewhat apart from the stream of our poetry, and tracing the inheritance of his very individual talent to François Villon and Edgar Allan Poe, with an occasional dash of Keats.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He finished his career with 114 wins, was a two-time All-Star, and helped the Mets win the World Series in .\n\nBorn in Honolulu, Hawaii, Fernandez was proud of his roots and wore uniform number 50 in honor of Hawaii being the 50th state. The theme song to \"Hawaii Five-O\" was often played before his starts at Shea Stadium during his days with the Mets.\n\nFernandez had an unorthodox pitching motion with a hesitation at the end, followed by a sudden slingshot sidearm delivery. This deceptive motion, coupled with an effective curveball and a rising fastball, made him a major strikeout threat throughout his career. Fernandez's strikeouts were often commemorated by Mets' fans in the upper deck putting up taped signs marked with the letter \"S\" for Sid.\n\nFernandez has the fourth-lowest ratio of hits allowed per innings pitched in Major League history, behind only Nolan Ryan, Clayton Kershaw, and Sandy Koufax.\n\nAccording to the Portuguese Heritage Foundation, Fernandez is believed to be of Portuguese descent. He attended St. Louis High School (briefly) and Kaiser High School in Honolulu and pitched a no-hitter in his first high school start. He led the Kaiser High School Cougars to a state championship in 1981 and was drafted out of high school at age 18 by the Los Angeles Dodgers, who chose him in the third round (73rd overall) of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft.\n\nOver 76 innings pitched with the Pioneer League's Lethbridge Dodgers, Fernandez struck out 128 batters, and posted a 5-1 record, with a 1.54 ERA his first professional season. After going 8-1 with a 1.91 ERA and 137 strikeouts for the class high A Vero Beach Dodgers in the first half of the season, Fernandez was promoted to the AAA Albuquerque Dukes, though he was less successful there, and was assigned to the AA San Antonio Dodgers for . At San Antonio, Fernandez went 13-4 with a 2.82 ERA and 209 strikeouts to become only the second pitcher ever to win the Texas League's pitching triple crown.\n\nFernandez was named the Texas League Pitcher of the Year, and received a September call-up to the Los Angeles Dodgers, making his major league debut on September 20 versus the Houston Astros, entering the game in the sixth inning, and allowing one earned run in three innings of work. He made his first Major League start in the last game of the season, losing to the San Francisco Giants.\n\nFernandez fought weight problems throughout his time in the Dodgers organization. He did not make the Dodgers' post-season roster, and following their loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1983 National League Championship Series, the Dodgers traded him and infielder Ross Jones to the New York Mets for Carlos Diaz and Bob Bailor.\n\nIn , Fernandez posted a record of 6-5 with a 2.56 ERA and 123 strikeouts with the Triple-A Tidewater Tides, earning a call-up to the Mets in mid-July. Fernandez earned his first Major League win in his first start with the Mets in a 13-3 victory against the Houston Astros at the Astrodome on July 16. For the season, he went 6-6 with a 3.50 ERA in 15 starts in the big leagues.\nFernandez split the season between Tidewater and the Mets. In 170 innings, Fernandez struck out 180 batters, while only allowing 108 hits for New York. Both ratios were the best in the Major Leagues, with second place in both categories going to teammate and Cy Young Award winner Dwight Gooden. Fernandez's average 5.71 hits allowed per nine innings was the second-best in National League history, behind only Carl Lundgren's mark of 5.65 in . Fernandez struggled with walks and wound up finishing the year with a record of 9-9. In seven of his nine losses, he gave up two earned runs or fewer. Despite having the third-best record in baseball at 98-64, the Mets placed second in their division and missed the postseason.\n\nFernandez finished with a career-best record of 16-6 in . A 12-2 start resulted in his first All-Star Game appearance and the first-ever appearance by a Hawaii native in the game. In his only inning of the All-Star Game, Fernandez walked the first two batters, but then struck out Brook Jacoby, Jim Rice, and Don Mattingly in succession to get out of the inning. During the regular season, Fernandez posted a 2.17 ERA at home and had a 5.03 in road games. Fernandez was one of four Mets pitchers to receive consideration for the 1986 Cy Young Award, marking the only Cy Young vote of his career. He finished seventh behind the Houston Astros' Mike Scott.\n\nThe Mets easily won the National League East with their record of 108-54. In Game 4 of the 1986 National League Championship Series, Fernandez went head to head with Scott with a chance to give Mets a 3-1 lead in the series. Fernandez gave up two home runs in the game, ultimately allowing three earned runs in six innings as the Astros prevailed by a 3-1 score. The Mets recovered to win the next two games and advance to the World Series.\n\nIn the World Series, Mets' manager Davey Johnson opted to go with a three-man rotation and use Fernandez out of the bullpen against the Boston Red Sox. Gooden struggled in Game 5, falling behind 4-0 in the game. Fernandez took over in the fifth inning and shut down the Red Sox for the next four innings, but Boston still came away with a 4-2 win to go up 3-2 in the series. After the Mets won the legendary Bill Buckner Game 6, the Red Sox took an early 3-0 lead in the decisive Game 7, forcing Mets' starter Ron Darling out of the game. Fernandez came in and retired seven batters in a row, including four strikeouts, to give New York some momentum. The Mets came back by scoring three runs in the sixth inning, three more in the seventh, and two in the eighth to get the 8-5 victory and claim their second World Series crown.\n\nIn , Fernandez once again started strong to earn another All-Star Game bid, but was only 3-3 during the second half of the season, missing three weeks in August due to a knee injury. For the second year in row, Fernandez fared much better at home by 9-3 with a 2.98 ERA at Shea, compared to 3-5 record and a 5.05 ERA on the road. Similar to 1985, the Mets had a better record than two division winners, but were unable to win the NL East, and thus missed the postseason.\n\nWith the 1988 National League Championship Series tied 2-2, Fernandez was tabbed to start Game 5 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He pitched well for the first three innings, but gave up three runs in the fourth inning, and then allowed a three-run homer to Kirk Gibson in the fifth as the Dodgers went on to get a 7-4 victory. Los Angeles ultimately won the series in seven games.\n\nFernandez started the season in the bullpen, but quickly worked his way back in the rotation. Heading into the All-Star break, he had a record of 7-2 with an ERA under 3.00. In his first game after the break, Fernandez struck out a career-high 16 batters in eight innings against the Atlanta Braves, but lost the game on a ninth-inning home run. The strikeout total is still the all-time Mets' record for a left-hander. Fernandez ended the season with record of 14-5, the best winning percentage in the National League, and was ranked in the top 10 in the league in ERA, strikeouts, hits allowed per nine innings, strikeouts per nine innings, and strikeout-to-walk ratio. He pitched well on the road by compiling a 7-3 record with a 2.91 ERA. Fernandez won his last three games, although the Mets came up short of the postseason by placing second in their division.\n\nIn , Fernandez finished the season with a record of 9-14, the worst of his career. He pitched well at home, going 8-5 with a 2.41 ERA, but was 1-9 with a 4.94 ERA on the road. \n\nFernandez broke his arm during spring training in . He returned in mid-July and then went down again with knee problems in early September.\n\nIn , Fernandez posted a team-leading 14 wins for the Mets, who finished in fifth place in their division for the second-straight year.\n\nAfter 1993, Fernandez never came close to his numbers with the Mets and never again played in the postseason. He was signed by the Baltimore Orioles for and managed to strike out 7.41 batters per nine innings in his only full season there before the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. But his 5.15 ERA was the worst of his career to that point and, despite again spending time on the disabled list, his 27 home runs allowed was second-worst in the Majors. He spent more time on the disabled list in . On June 29, Fernandez allowed three home runs in a game for the first time in his career in a 5-1 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, dropping his record to 0-4. He was released during the All-Star break.\n\nThree days after being released by the Orioles, Fernandez was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies. He showed flashes of brilliance — including a one-hit game over seven innings on July 26 — and went 6-1 for the Phils. He was named NL Pitcher of the Month in August by going 5-0. The resurgence earned Fernandez his only opening day start in but injuries ended his season in June and he again a free agent.\n\nOn September 28, 1996, Fernandez' father-in-law, Don Mike Gillis, was shot to death in Honolulu. Fernandez soon announced the dedication of his 1997 season to Gillis.

After just one start, he was back on the disabled list; after unsuccessful rehabilitation, Fernandez retired on August 1, 1997.\n\nFernandez allowed only 6.85 hits per nine innings for his career which is the fourth-best total in history behind only Nolan Ryan, Clayton Kershaw, and Sandy Koufax. Opponents batted only .209 against him.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Fernandez moved back to his native Hawaii. He was hired as an executive assistant to Mayor of Honolulu Jeremy Harris in an effort to find sponsors and users for sporting facilities on Hawaii's Oahu island.

In 2004, Fernandez served as a coach in a Hawaii high school baseball all-star game. .\n\nFernandez was selected by CNN Sports Illustrated as one of the 50 greatest sports figures in Hawai'i history.\n\nFernandez has also spent a lot of time golfing in celebrity matches and making other appearances since his retirement. He and his wife, Noelani, operate the Sid Fernandez Foundation, which awards four $5,000 college scholarships each year to seniors from the Fernandezes' alma mater, Kaiser High School.\n\nOn December 20, 2007, Fernandez's name appeared in the unsealed Kirk Radomski affidavit. The affidavit details Radomski receiving a $3,500 check from Fernandez dated February 2005, but the affidavit does not specify its purpose. Fernandez was one of only four baseball players listed in the affidavit who was not referred to in the Mitchell Report, the others being Rick Holifield, Pete Rose, Jr. and Ryan Schurman.\n\n"}
{"id": "2147190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147190", "title": "Bass saxophone", "text": "Bass saxophone\n\nThe bass saxophone is one of the largest members of the saxophone family—larger than the more commonly encountered baritone saxophone. It was the first type of saxophone exhibited to the public, when Adolphe Sax presented a bass saxophone in C at an exhibition in Brussels in 1841. The modern bass saxophone is a transposing instrument pitched in B, an octave below the tenor saxophone. The bass saxophone is not a commonly used instrument, but it is heard on some 1920s jazz recordings; in free jazz; in saxophone choirs; and occasionally in concert bands.\n\nThe instrument was first used in 1844, both by Hector Berlioz in an arrangement of his \"Chant sacre\", and by Georges Kastner in his opera \"Le Dernier Roi de Juda\". In the 1950s and 1960s it enjoyed a brief vogue in orchestrations for musical theater: Leonard Bernstein’s original score for \"West Side Story\" includes bass saxophone, as does Meredith Willson’s \"Music Man\" and Sandy Wilson’s \"The Boy Friend\". Australian composer Percy Grainger and American composer Warren Benson have championed the use of the instrument in their music for concert band.\n\nAlthough bass saxophones in C were made for orchestral use, modern instruments are in B. This puts them a perfect fourth below the baritone and an octave lower than the tenor. Music is written in treble clef, just as for the other saxophones, with the pitches sounding two octaves and a major second lower than written. As with most other members of the saxophone family, the lowest written note is the B below the staff—sounding as a concert A in the first octave (~ 51.9 Hz). German wind instrument maker Benedikt Eppelsheim has made bass saxophones to low A, similarly to the extension in the baritone saxophone. This sounds as a concert G in the first octave (~ 49 Hz).\n\nUntil the start of the 21st century, the largest existing member of the saxophone family was the rare contrabass, pitched in E, a perfect fifth lower than the bass. Inventor Adolphe Sax had a patent for a subcontrabass saxophone (or \"bourdon\" saxophone), but apparently never built a fully functioning instrument. In 1999, Benedikt Eppelsheim introduced the subcontrabass tubax, a modified saxophone pitched in B an octave below the bass saxophone.\n\nThe bass saxophone enjoyed some measure of popularity in jazz combos and dance bands between World War I and World War II, primarily providing bass lines, although players occasionally took melodic solos. Notable players of this era include Billy Fowler, Coleman Hawkins, Otto Hardwicke (of the Duke Ellington orchestra), Adrian Rollini (who was a pioneer bass sax solos in the 1920s into the 1930s), Min Leibrook, Spencer Clark, Charlie Ventura and Vern Brown of the Six Brown Brothers. The bass sax became more scarce in standard jazz band instrumentation during the mid-to-late 1920s. Sheet music of the period shows many bands photographed with a bass sax in their collection of instruments. It was sometimes played by the tuba or string bass player rather a member of the sax section.\n\nAmerican bandleader Boyd Raeburn (1913–1966), who led an avant-garde big band in the 1940s, was a sometime bass saxophonist. In Britain, the leader of the Oscar Rabin Band also played it. Harry Gold, a member of Rabin's band, played bass saxophone in his own band, \"Pieces of Eight\". American bandleader Stan Kenton's \"Mellophonium Orchestra\" (1960–1963) featured fourteen brass players and used a saxophone section of one alto, two tenors, baritone, and bass on Johnny Richards' compositions. Joel Kaye played baritone and bass saxophone in that band. The ensemble recorded several successful albums, winning two Grammys. The Lawrence Welk Band featured Bill Page soloing on bass sax on several broadcasts during the 1960s. Shorty Rogers's \"Swingin' Nutcracker\" (recorded for RCA Victor in 1960) featured a bass saxophone on four of the movements (played by Bill Hood).\n\nThe 1970s traditional jazz band The Memphis Nighthawks built their sound around diminutive bass saxophonist Dave Feinman. Some revivalist bass saxophonists performing today in the 1920s–1930s style are Vince Giordano and Bert Brandsma, leader of the Dixieland Crackerjacks. Jazz players using the instrument in a more contemporary style include Roscoe Mitchell, Anthony Braxton, Peter Brötzmann, J. D. Parran, Hamiet Bluiett, James Carter, Stefan Zeniuk, Michael Marcus (musician) Vinny Golia, Joseph Jarman, Brian Landrus, Urs Leimgruber, Tony Bevan, and Scott Robinson, although none of these players use it as their primary instrument.\n\nJan Garbarek plays a bass sax on the 1973 album Red Lanta.\n\nBass saxophonists in rock include:\n\nThe bass saxophone is sometimes used as an instrument in concert bands, typically in arrangements made before 1950. It is used most frequently in saxophone choirs, specifically those in the direct legacy of teacher-soloist Sigurd Rascher.\n\nIt is rarely used in orchestral music, though several examples exist. The earliest extant work to employ it is William Henry Fry's \"sacred symphony\" \"Hagar In the Wilderness\" (1853), which also calls for soprano saxophone and was written for Louis-Antoine Jullien's orchestra during its American tour. It was also used by Richard Strauss in his \"Sinfonia Domestica\", where included in the music are parts for four saxophones including a bass saxophone in C. Arnold Schoenberg wrote for the bass sax in his one-act opera \"Von Heute auf Morgen\", and Karlheinz Stockhausen includes a part for it in the saxophone section of \"Lucifer's Dance\", the third scene of \"Samstag aus Licht\".\n\n"}

After that, he moved to IFK Velen in 2003.\n\nAfter spending two years in the youth team, during the 2005 season Berg was promoted to the regular squad and played for IFK Göteborg in the Allsvenskan. During the time playing for IFK Göteborg, he played alongside his older brother Jonatan.\n\nBerg played for IFK Göteborg until the 2007 summer and put forth an attracting performance throughout his final season, as he maintained a high scoring efficiency throughout the league matches. Göteborg won the league that season and Berg received a standing ovation upon leaving the field after the 5–0 away victory over Kalmar FF where Berg scored, which was his last for the club because of his suspension for the game against Djurgårdens IF.\n\nAmong dedicated IFK Göteborg supporters, Berg is known as \"Svarte-Marcus\" (\"Black Marcus\") due to his many goals in the Göteborg youth and reserve teams, and later also senior team. The nickname is an homage to the legendary IFK Göteborg striker Filip \"\"Svarte-Filip\"\" Johansson.\n\nOn 10 August 2007, Dutch club FC Groningen signed Berg for a reported £2.5 million to replace the departing Ajax-bound Luis Suárez.\n\nBerg had a good debut season in the Netherlands. Although he was not the top scorer in the Eredivisie in 2007–08, he scored 18 goals for Groningen, helping the Dutch outfit to a seventh-place finish.\n\nIn the 2008–09 season, Groningen remained top of the Eredivisie table after five games played. Berg had a good display as well. He managed to score 13 goals in 15 matches. He also scored four goals in a December game against Roda JC.\n\nOn 17 July 2009, German Bundesliga side Hamburger SV confirmed that Berg had signed a five-year contract with the club. The official FC Groningen website mentioned it was a record fee paid for a Groningen player. \"Dagblad van het Noorden\", a Dutch newspaper, stated that Berg swapped clubs for €10.5 million. The contract also mentioned that a friendly match will be played between Groningen and Hamburg in the summer of 2010 or 2011 in the Euroborg, the main stadium of Groningen. Although initially the fee of €9.5 million was too high for Hamburg, Berg's desire of moving to the Bundesliga persuaded Groningen to complete the transfer. In his first Bundesliga game for Hamburg, playing at home against Borussia Dortmund, Berg scored his first goal for the club in the 72nd minute, just 182 seconds after coming off the bench, a record in the club's history. Despite the promising start, his debut season in the Bundesliga would not become a success, with Berg only scoring three additional goals in 30 appearances.\n\nOn 17 July 2010, PSV and Hamburger SV agreed to a loan deal, with the result that Berg played for PSV the 2010–11 season.\n\nAfter returning from his loan spell at PSV, Berg only made 13 appearances the 2011–12 Bundesliga due to injuries and continued lack of form, scoring once. On 9 November 2012, Hamburger SV athletic supervisor Frank Arnesen stated that the club had to sell five players to raise funds after having invested heavily in new players in the previous summer, including Dutch star Rafael van der Vaart; one of these five players was said to be Berg. After these news, Berg was linked with a return to his former club IFK Göteborg.\n\nOn 4 July 2013, it was revealed that Berg had travelled to Athens in order to sign with Panathinaikos. On 8 July 2013, Panathinaikos announced that Berg had signed a four-year contract with the club.

On the first derby of the year against PAOK, Berg scored Panathinaikos' goal and lost a penalty, as his team lost with a score of 2–1. On 2 March 2014, Berg was the MVP in the 3–0 away victory against Olympiacos with one goal and one assist for Danijel Pranjić. This was the biggest away victory in the history of the Eternal Rivals. The following week, he scored a hat-trick when Panathinaikos defeated Aris 4–1 at home.\n\nOn 26 April 2014, in the Greek Cup final against rivals PAOK, Berg scored a hat-trick to lead Panathinaikos to a 4–1 victory, who won the Greek Cup as they had done in 2010. On 11 January 2015, Berg scored his second hat-trick in a 5–0 home win against Ergotelis in the Superleague Greece. On 26 January 2015, he signed a one-year extension contract, until 2018.

Additionally, Marseille tried to complete a move for the Swedish striker on the deadline date, however, they were put off by Panathinaikos's price tag.\n\nOn 6 September 2015, Berg was left frustrated as he did not start in the line-up for the game against Russia. Sweden lost 1–0 at the hands of Russia with Berg making his appearance for only 30 minutes on the pitch as he started from the bench. Swedish press criticised this decision and Berg demanded first team football in the National Team after the final whistle.\"\"Ola Toivonen is a kind of a different player than me and this decision has been taken. But it's pretty clear that I want to play as I'm in a decent form,\"\" the Panathinaikos striker underlined straight after the game. On 7 November 2015, he scored the winning goal in the 10th day of the Greek Superleague match against Atromitos, It was his 50th goal with the club in all competitions.

On 18 September 2016, he was the scorer of two goals, helping the club to achieve a 4–0 home win against PAS Giannina. It was his first goals for the 2016–17 season. On 23 September 2016, Berg extended his three-year contract for an annual fee of €1.1 million and with a €10 million release clause.

He became the leading scorer of Superleague so far and named MVP of the march. On 11 March 2017, Panathinaikos striker scored his 24th goal into the season breaking his own record since he joined the Greens.

The 31-year-old international and captain of the Greens showed unprofessional behavior on home clash against PAOK (1–0), which was finally interrupted by referee Giorgos Kominis at 55', and will not perform at the four remaining matches.\n\nOn 20 June 2017, the Administration of Panathinaikos rejected the first offer of Al Ain FC (€2.5–3 million) about the purchase of experienced Swedish striker. The Greens are holding the 55% of the rights of 31-year-old international (his former team, Hamburger SV, have the other 35%), whose current contract expires in the summer of 2019, with a buy-out clause of €5.2 million, but the negotiations with the UAE club are expected to be continued, while Berg has already agreed to sign a two (plus one) years' season contract with Al Ain, with an annual salary of €3 million after taxes.\n\nOn 28 June 2017, however, Al Ain FC confirmed the move was finalised following lengthy negotiations with Panathinaikos, with the figure believed to be around €3 million. Berg, has agreed to a two-year contract, although there exists an option to renew. He replaces in the squad Saudi Arabia striker Nasser Al-Shamrani. A statement from Panathinaikos read: \"Unfortunately, Marcus Berg chose to leave Panathinaikos because he felt that at that time, close to the end of his career, he wanted to get a big financial benefit. There were some misunderstandings during the negotiations. We forget them, as Marcus has offered a lot to Panathinaikos. We wish him good luck in the step he chose and wait for him if he wishes to close his career in our club.\"\n\nOn 16 April 2018, following an incredible season in UAE Pro-League, Berg was twice on target as his club advanced to the last 16 stage of the AFC Champions League with an emphatic 4–1 rout of Qatar's Al Rayyan SC.

He was omitted from the team later in June of that year for the UEFA Euro 2008.\n\nBerg was called-up regularly during Sweden's 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign. He scored his first goal for the team on 10 June 2009 in the 4–0 home win over Malta. He was on the scoresheet also in the final matchday against Albania, netting the second in an eventual 4–1 home win, which was not enough to secure Sweden a place at the tournament. With 2 goals, he was Sweden's joint second top goalscorer along with Zlatan Ibrahimović and behind Olof Mellberg.\n\nBerg managed only two appearances at UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying, both of them as substitute, recording only 19 minutes on the field. He scored one goal, the last of the 6–0 home win over San Marino on 7 September 2010. Sweden finished Group E as runner-up which was enough for a place at final tournament, which Berg missed out.\n\nAt 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, Berg was part of the team only in the first Group C matches; he made only two appearances, both as replacement, netting only one time in the 2–0 home win over Kazakhstan on 11 September 2012.

Two years later, his first book, \"Jiving to Gyp\", a sequence of poems, was published. He performed his poetry on stage and TV to backing by Cliff Richard's original group, the Shadows, as well as Jimmy Page,{{cn|date=May 2019}} and featured in a 1960 TV documentary, \"Living for Kicks\", presented by Daniel Farson, which brought him to national attention and controversy through his remarks on teenage lifestyle, and as a spokesman of his generation. \n\nHe wrote two books in 1959 and 1961 about touring with Cliff Richard and The Shadows, republished in 2014 by Tomahawk Press as a rock and roll memoir. In June 1960, he travelled to Liverpool, England to perform a poetry reading at Liverpool University. As he usually read his poetry with backing from jazz musicians, Ellis searched among the locals for suitable musicians to accompany him and met the young group comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Stuart Sutcliffe. Ellis bonded with Lennon in particular, both sharing an enthusiasm for the American Beat poets, and spent the week at 3 Gambier Terrace with Lennon, Sutcliffe, et al. Lennon saw Ellis as \"the converging point of rock 'n' roll and literature\". Ellis said of the meeting, \"I was quite a star for them at that time because I had come up from London and that was a world they didn't really know about\". According to Lennon in the \"International Times\": \"The first dope, from a Benzedrine inhaler, was given to the Beatles (John, George, Paul and Stuart) by an English cover version of Allen Ginsberg — one Royston Ellis, known as 'beat poet' ... So, give the saint his due.\" Ellis also claimed that he suggested the re-spelling of Beetles to Beatles.\n\nIn 1961 his book survey of pop music at the dawn of the \"Swinging Sixties\", \"The Big Beat Scene\" was published. It was reprinted with additional comments in 2010 by Music Mentor Press. Ellis's novel, \"Myself For Fame\" (1964), about a fictional pop star, has a chapter set in Liverpool that seems to recount his experiences with The \"Beetles\" in 1960. Ellis is one of the people the song \"Paperback Writer\" was based on, quoting a comment he had made years earlier while in Liverpool, and was also present at a liaison between Lennon and \"Polythene Pam\" in Guernsey in 1963. In 1980, John Lennon said:That was me, remembering a little event with a woman in Jersey, and a man who was England's answer to Allen Ginsberg .. I met him when we were on tour and he took me back to his apartment and I had a girl and he had one he wanted me to meet. He said she dressed up in polythene, which she did. She didn't wear jack boots and kilts, I just sort of elaborated. Perverted sex in a polythene bag. Just looking for something to write about.\" \n\nAt 20, Ellis retired from the teenage beatnik and rock and roll scene and left England permanently for a life of travel that took him to East Berlin and Moscow, where he read his poetry on stage with the Russian poet Yevgeni Yevtushenko. Then, via Guernsey where he became a registered ferry boat engineer, he sailed to the Canary Islands, and acted as an Arab with Cliff Richard in the movie \"Wonderful Life\". He stayed in Las Palmas for three years, becoming the editor of the islands' English language newspaper, \"The Canary Islands Sun\", and wrote three novels.\n\nHe hiked around West Africa, then landed up in the British Virgin Islands before settling, in 1966, in Dominica where he wrote the best-selling \"Bondmaster\" series of historical novels as Richard Tresillian; as well as becoming President of the Dominica Cricket Association, a member of the MCC and of the Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control, and a Life Fellow of the Royal Commonwealth Society.\n\nIn 1979, after his hillside log cabin in Dominica was blown down by Hurricane David, he moved to Sri Lanka where he lives in a colonial cottage overlooking the Indian Ocean. \nThe author of over 60 published books (guides, novels, biographies and volumes of poetry) he also writes travel features for inflight, international and Sri Lankan magazines.

Written by frontman Chris Cornell, \"The Day I Tried to Live\" was released in 1994 as the second single from the band's fourth studio album, \"Superunknown\" (1994). The song peaked at number 13 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 25 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was included on Soundgarden's 1997 greatest hits album, \"A-Sides\".\n\n\"The Day I Tried to Live\" was written by frontman Chris Cornell. The tuning, as with many Soundgarden songs is unorthodox—E-E-B-B-B-B. The song has a dissonant atmosphere and is also notable for its changing time signatures. For much of the song, there is a cycle of one measure of 7/4, then two of 4/4. Guitarist Kim Thayil has said that Soundgarden usually did not consider the time signature of a song until after the band had written it, and said that the use of odd meters was \"a total accident.\"\n\nCornell on \"The Day I Tried to Live\":\nIt's about trying to step out of being patterned and closed off and reclusive, which I've always had a problem with. It's about attempting to be normal and just go out and be around other people and hang out. I have a tendency to sometimes be pretty closed off and not see people for long periods of time and not call anyone. It's actually, in a way, a hopeful song. Especially the lines \"One more time around/Might do it\", which is basically saying, 'I tried today to understand and belong and get along with other people, and I failed, but I'll probably try again tomorrow.' A lot of people misinterpreted that song as a suicide-note song. Taking the word \"live\" too literally. \"The Day I Tried to Live\" means more like the day I actually tried to open up myself and experience everything that's going on around me as opposed to blowing it all off and hiding in a cave.\n\n\"The Day I Tried to Live\" was released as a single in 1994, but was rather underpromoted when compared to \"Spoonman\" or \"Black Hole Sun\". The song peaked at number 13 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 25 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart. Outside the United States, the single was released in Spain and the United Kingdom. In Canada, \"The Day I Tried to Live\" charted on the Alternative Top 30 chart where it peaked at number 27 and stayed there for two weeks.\n\nThe music video for \"The Day I Tried to Live\" was directed by Matt Mahurin. The video features a man apparently dressed as a hospital patient floating around a bedroom and appearing alone and dazed in various city scenes. It also features the band performing the song in a boiler room. After the first chorus, the band members are shown with their instruments ablaze. The video was released in April 1994. The video is available on the CD-ROM \"Alive in the Superunknown\".\n\n\"The Day I Tried to Live\" was covered by Between the Buried and Me on the band's 2006 album \"The Anatomy Of\".\n\nAll songs written by Chris Cornell, except where noted:\n\n\n\n\nnote: etched vinyl + Superunknown stencil\n\n"}

Based in Waterloo, Iowa, the company was created by John Froelich and a group of Iowa businessmen in 1893, and was originally named the Waterloo Gasoline Traction Engine Company. In 1892, Froelich had invented the first practical gasoline-powered tractor, and the new company was given the opportunity to manufacture and sell the tractor Froelich designed. Unfortunately, the tractor was not successful commercially, and of the four tractors built by the company only two were purchased, and these were later returned to the company by unsatisfied customers. In 1895, the company was sold to John W. Miller and renamed the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company. Miller decided to stop producing tractors and instead focus on building plain gasoline engines.\nFollowing several years of research and development, the company once again began to manufacture tractors in 1911, but none would sell well until 1913, when twenty “Waterloo Boy” tractors were produced. In 1914 the company introduced the Model R Waterloo Boy. This tractor proved immensely popular, and over eight thousand were sold before the line was discontinued in 1923. The company also had great success with the Model N, which was introduced in late 1916. Despite the company's name, both the Model R and Model N burned kerosene for fuel. \n\nBy this time, several other companies had begun to build and sell tractors, but the Waterloo Boy was easily one of the most popular. In 1918, Deere & Company, a farm equipment company based in Moline, Illinois purchased the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company for $2,100,000. Deere & Company had been anxious to enter the growing tractor market, but its own initial designs had proved unsuccessful. Executives at Deere & Company decided to purchase the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Co. because field tests indicated that the Waterloo Boy tractor had the best performance. After the sale was completed, the company became known as the John Deere Tractor Company, but tractors produced by the company continued to be sold under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923, when the John Deere Model D was introduced.\n\n"}

Eisenhower on January 29th, 1955 to counteract the threat of an invasion of Formosa by the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The resolution gave the U.S. President the authority “to employ the Armed Forces of the United States as he deems necessary for the specific purpose of securing and protecting Formosa and the Pescadores against armed attack [by the Communists]”.\n\nThe resolution was formulated amid the Taiwan Strait Crisis (1954–1955), which was a brief period of armed conflict that involved incursions made by the Communist Party of China (CPC) on the islands in the Taiwan Strait inhabited by the Kuomintang (KMT) led Republic of China (ROC). A latent response by the United Nations Security Council regarding these developments prompted U.S. President Eisenhower to request the resolution in January of 1955.\n\nJuly 3rd 1884 marked the beginning of Sino-American relations when the Treaty of Wanghai, the first treaty signed between the United States and Qing China, established a peaceful relationship between the two nations. Formosa and its nearby islands remained under Qing rule until ceded in full sovereignty to Japan in the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki following the 1884-1885 Sino-Japanese War. Half a century later Japan was on the losing side of the Second World War, and the Cairo Declaration of 1943 established that jurisdiction over the islands would be returned to China should Japan surrender. Fighting as allies in the Pacific War, the United States formally acknowledged China’s right to all territories stolen from China by the Japanese, including Formosa. In a statement of neutrality given by U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson in January 1950, the U.S. Government declared it was “not going to get involved militarily in any way on the Island”.\n\nIn the early 1950s however, peaceful relations between the United States and the People’s Republic of China began to deteriorate. In the months succeeding the declaration of neutrality, the PRC seized all U.S. consular property in Beijing, signed the 1950 Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union, and began growing its forces at Chekiang and Fukien, opposite Formosa. These developments, along with the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, prompted the order of an American fleet to position itself in the Taiwan Strait to prevent a possible attack on Formosa by the PRC. The ROC had always been perceived by Western powers as China’s only legitimate government and had thus held it’s seat at the United Nations since the organization's establishment. Following the Communist Party of China’s victory in the Chinese Civil War, the official establishment of the PRC raised questions of who China’s legal representative at the UN should be, and the U.S. vote against a seat for the PRC at the UN further intensified Sino-American tensions. In the early- to mid-1950s, the United States launched a trade embargo and began a policy of isolation and containment towards the PRC.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1954, the Eisenhower administration increased its diplomatic, economic, and military aid to Taiwan, with economic aid valued at USD $527 million and military aid at USD $940 million. On September 3rd, 1954, the CPC began a heavy artillery bombing of the Chinese islands of Quemoy and Matsu, a smaller group of islands just off the mainland that ROC officials considered optimal for strategic positioning and reinvasion of the mainland. The PRC additionally held thirteen American prisoners and was threatening their execution, prompting further action by the Eisenhower administration. On December 2nd, 1954, the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty was signed between the U.S. and the ROC, in addition to other mutual security agreements in the Pacific.\n\nOn January 6th 1955, President Eisenhower submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratify the Mutual Defense Treaty between the U.S. and the ROC, which outlined that an armed attack in the West Pacific area directed against Formosa and the Pescadores territories.\n\nWhen the Communist Party of China's forces seized control of Inchaing Island, located 210 miles north of Taiwan in mid-January 1955, calls for U.S. military intervention intensified as the CPC's continued attacks towards Quemoy and Matsu, extending armed skirmishes between the two governments as far as mainland Chinese ports. These developments prompted action from President Eisenhower. On January 24th, Eisenhower requested permission from Congress to use military force to defend Taiwan. By the next day, January 25th of 1955, the House approved a resolution requested by President Eisenhower that authorized the president to defend Formosa (Taiwan) and the Pescadores Islands by a vote of 410-3 in the House of Representatives. On January 28th, 1955, the Senate approved the resolution. On the same day the U.S. Senate approved this resolution, the Formosa problem had finally gained the attention of the U.N. Security Council. However, due to the PRC's refusal to join the discussion, the issue was effectively dropped from the agenda of the U.N. Regardless, with the approval of the House and the Senate, President Eisenhower moved forward by signing the Resolution on January 29th, 1955. The U.S. officially adopted the Formosa Resolution, a purported mechanism to prevent another crisis in the Taiwan Strait, as was experienced in the First Taiwan Strait Crisis (1954–1955). The Resolution empowered President Eisenhower to fully defend Formosa by granting him the authority to employ U.S. armed forces in the Taiwan Strait. While the Resolution authorized the U.S. president to use force to defend Formosa, it did not explicitly express an overt support for the ROC's government. The Resolution was an attempt to prevent further military conflict between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China without explicitly siding with Formosa.\n\nThe Joint Resolution did not resolve the Taiwan Strait Crisis, nor did it alleviate the hostility between the PRC and the ROC. Instead, the Resolution broadened the scope of the Mutual Defense Treaty by extending U.S. commitments to defend from PRC incursions of the offshore islands, in addition to Taiwan.\n\nAs the crisis continued into early spring, U.S. officials warned publicly of the potential use of nuclear weapons when in March of 1955, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles called for stronger U.S. intervention. Tensions were temporarily alleviated in April 1955 when the PRC announced that they were prepared to negotiate on Taiwan and ceased bombardment of Quemoy and Matsu. In May the PRC officially halted its shelling and agreed to a negotiated truce. On September 12th, 1955, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consulted President Eisenhower, suggesting nuclear weapons should be used against the PRC if it launched a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. Making certain that Beijing was aware of this, the Eisenhower administration reached a temporary truce with the PRC until the conflict was revived when Taiwan began military reinforcement of the two islands. By 1957, the United States provided Taiwan with missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. When the second Quemoy crisis broke in 1958, which involved another deployment of U.S. air and naval forces, President Eisenhower threatened to use nuclear weapons once again.\n\nOver a decade after the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, the U.S. broke their relations with the ROC when the U.S. abrogated the mutual security pact and withdrew U.S. forces and military installations from Taiwan in January 1970.\n\nThe year 1971 marked the beginning of positive relations between the U.S. and the PRC. These positive relations formulated in Ping-Pong Diplomacy, when the Chinese ping-pong team invited members of the U.S. team to the People’s Republic of China on April 6, 1971. The U.S. players, as well as the Journalists accompanying them, were among the first Americans allowed to enter the PRC since 1949. In July of the same year, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made a secret trip to China. Following the secret trip, the United Nations began to recognize the PRC and endowed them the permanent Security Council seat, effectively removing the Republic of China who had held the seat since 1945.\n\nRelations between the People's Republic of China and the United States continued to improve when in February of 1972,  U.S. President Richard Nixon spent eight days in the PRC. During his visit, Nixon met with Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the PRC, and signed the Shanghai Communiqué with Premier Zhou Enlai. The communiqué set the stage for improved Sino-American relations by allowing People's Republic of China and the United States to discuss sensitive issues, particularly Taiwan. However, normalization of relations between the two countries made slow progress throughout the decade.\n\nBy 1979, U.S. President Jimmy Carter recognized the legitimacy of the People’s Republic of China. In doing so, the U.S. acknowledged mainland China's One China principle and severed their ties with Taiwan. However by April, Congress rekindled their relations with Taiwan with the approval of the Taiwan Relations Act, which allowed the continuation of commercial and cultural relations between the U.S. and Taiwan as well as requirement of the U.S. to provide Taiwan with defensive arms. The act also did not officially violate the One-China policy. The Carter Administration's approval of the act neutrally positioned the U.S. in the Taiwan Pacific strait as the act restored U.S. relations with Taiwan while maintaining its recognition of the People's Republic of China as the legitimate representative of China.\n\nIn the 1980s, the U.S. President Ronald Reagan and his administration issued the “Six Assurances” to Taiwan. The \"Six Assurances\" included pledges by the U.S. to honour the Taiwan Relations Act, to not intervene in ongoing disputes between Taiwan and China, and to not terminate arms sales to Taiwan. \n\nBy August 1982, the Reagan administration signed the third joint communiqué agreement with the PRC's government. The signing of this agreement effectively normalized relations between the U.S. and China, and reiterates the U.S.' allegiance to the One China policy. President Reagan had voiced support for stronger ties with Taiwan, however, due to fears of Soviet expansion in the Cold War era, President Reagan's administration was pressured to strengthen ties with China. As such, by June of 1984, President Reagan's administration permitted the sale of U.S. military equipment to Beijing. \n\nDespite the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1996, which involved Chinese missile tests in the waters near Taiwan, Taiwan held their first free presidential vote in 1996. These missile tests were meant to sway Taiwanese voters to vote against the pro-independence candidate, which was the Nationalist Party leader, Lee Teng-hui. Ultimately, Teng-hui won the election by a large margin in March 1996.\n\nBy the 2010s, the U.S. had recognized the PRC's China as the one and only China for decades. However, when Donald J. Trump won the U.S. presidential election in 2016, Trump broke the U.S. code of conduct towards China when he spoke with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in a telephone call. This rose questions over the U.S.' commitment to its One-China policy. President Trump attempted to alleviate these doubts during a call on February 9th, 2017 with China's paramount leader Xi Jinping, in which he restated he would honor the One China policy. Despite honoring this policy, the U.S. still maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan, including the provisions of defense aid.\n"}

King Jr. (born May 27, 1919, Meriden, Connecticut, died May 9, 2009 Cleveland, Ohio) was an attorney who served as a U.S. Prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials in 1946-47. Late in his career, he became a law professor and an activist, writer, and lecturer working on international law and war crimes; David M. Crane has described King as \"the George Washington of modern international law\".\n\nKing received his B.A. degree in 1941 from Yale College, and his LL.B. in 1943 from Yale Law School (1943). A heart murmur excluded him from military service during World War II. After practicing law for several years with the firm Milbank, Tweed & Hope, King became one of the United States prosecutors at the Nuremberg Trials, serving from 1946 to 1947. He was initially assigned to the prosecution of the German General Staff and the High Command, preparing cases against Walther von Brauchitsch, Heinz Guderian, and Erhard Milch for trial before Nuremberg Military Tribunals. Guderian was never tried, and von Brauchitsch died while awaiting trial. The Milch Trial convicted Milch on two of three counts, and he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. King also worked on the Ministries Case and the Justice Case.\n\nFollowing his service at Nuremberg, King had a long career as counsel for several corporations, including the TRW Corporation, from which he retired in 1981.\n\nIn the 1990s, King was a member of the American Bar Association Task Force on War Crimes in the former Yugoslavia. He subsequently influenced the charter of the International Criminal Court. When delegates from 131 nations established the criminal court in 1998, they did not initially include initiating wars of aggression as a war crime. With Whitney Harris and Benjamin Ferencz, two of the other prosecutors from Nuremberg, King traveled to the convention in Rome to successfully lobby for the court's jurisdiction over the instigators of such wars. Michael Scharf described their role in Rome: \"They used their moral authority; they were persistent, and ultimately the delegates included a reference to the crime of war of aggression in the court's statute.\"\n\nAs a part of preparing for the trial of Erhard Milch in 1946, King interviewed Albert Speer, one of the defendants who had been prosecuted at Nuremberg and convicted by the International Military Tribunal (the trial of the major war criminals). They later became friends. In 1997 King published a book with Bettina Elles, \"The Two Worlds of Albert Speer: Reflections of a Nuremberg Prosecutor\". King wrote there that, \"In a technological world, the magic concoction for evil consists of blind technocrats such as Speer led by an evil and aggressive leader such as Hitler.\"\n\nKing wrote more than 60 journal articles. From the mid-1980s until his death, King was a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, where he also served as the U.S. Director of the Canada-United States Law Institute.

In 1916 Johnson married and moved to Webb Jennings' plantation near Drew, Mississippi, close to the Dockery Plantation. There he met other musicians, including Charlie Patton and Willie Brown.\n\nBy 1920, Johnson was an itinerant musician based in Crystal Springs but traveling widely around the South, sometimes accompanied by Papa Charlie McCoy. In 1928, he made his first recordings, with McCoy, for Victor Records, including \"Canned Heat Blues\", in which he sang of drinking methanol from the cooking fuel Sterno. The song features the refrain \"canned heat, mama, sure, Lord, killing me.\" The blues group Canned Heat took their name from this song. Johnson's \"Big Road Blues\" inspired Canned Heat's song \"On the Road Again\". A significantly different version of the song appears as \"Canned Heat\" on the album \"Big Road Blues\" by K. C. Douglas.\n\nJohnson recorded two further sessions, for Victor in August 1928 and for Paramount Records in December 1929. He did not record again, mistakenly believing that he had signed away his right to record. Some suggest he had been intentionally given this misimpression by people at Paramount Records. This resulted in a legal settlement with the Mississippi Sheiks, who had used the melody of Johnson's \"Big Road Blues\" in their successful \"Stop and Listen\". Johnson was party to the copyright settlement but was too drunk at the time to understand what he had signed.\n\nJohnson's recordings established him as the premier Delta blues vocalist of his day, with a powerful voice that could go from a growl to a falsetto. He was an accomplished guitarist. He also performed tricks with his guitar, playing it between his legs and behind his head and throwing it in the air while playing.\n\nHis style influenced later blues singers, such as Robert Nighthawk and Howlin' Wolf (whose song \"I Asked for Water [She Brought Me Gasoline]\" was based on Johnson's \"Cool Drink of Water Blues\"), and the country singer Hank Williams. Johnson was a talented composer, blending fragments of folk poetry and personalized lyrics into set guitar accompaniments to craft striking blues compositions such as \"Maggie Campbell\".\n\nTo enhance his fame, Johnson cultivated a sinister persona. According to his brother LeDell, he claimed to have sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for his mastery of the guitar. This story was later also associated with Robert Johnson, to whom Tommy Johnson was unrelated.\n\nJohnson remained a popular performer in the Jackson area through the 1930s and 1940s, sometimes performing with Ishman Bracey. He influenced other performers, partly because he was willing to teach his style and his repertoire. His influence on local traditions is described by David Evans in the books \"Tommy Johnson\" (1971) and \"Big Road Blues: Tradition and Creativity in the Folk Blues\" (1982).\n\nJohnson died of a heart attack after playing at a local party in 1956. He is buried in the Warm Springs Methodist Church Cemetery, outside Crystal Springs, Mississippi. In April, 2000, Johnson family members gave permission for a headstone to be placed on Johnson's grave organized through the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund, a Mississippi nonprofit corporation active in historic African American cemetery preservation since 1989. Underwriting for the memorial was obtained through the support of blues musician Bonnie Raitt. The large granite memorial engraved with Johnson's portrait and including several of Johnson's best known songs, added at the family's request, was unveiled in October, 2001 in Crystal Springs, but was not placed on Johnson's actual grave for another 10 years however, because of a dispute between Johnson's family (led by his niece, Vera Johnson Collins), the owners of farm property encircling the cemetery, and the Copiah County Board of Supervisors over a deteriorated road that led to the burial site. The dispute was resolved in October 2012 thanks in large part to research work done by University of Mississippi researcher T.D.Moore. It was finally announced that the headstone would be erected on October 26 of that year. The headstone had been on public display in the Crystal Springs Public Library since being unveiled on October 20, 2001. On the night of Saturday, February 2, 2013, the headstone fell and was damaged. It is a matter of dispute whether it fell because it was inadequately secured or because it was pushed over or deliberately smashed.\n\nThe Tommy Johnson Blues Festival is held annually in Crystal Springs on the third weekend in October. The inaugural festival was held in Jackson and Crystal Springs in 2006.\n\nIn the film \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" (2000), a character named Tommy Johnson, played by Chris Thomas King, describes selling his soul to the devil to play guitar. The Tommy Johnson character in the film plays a number of songs originally recorded by the blues musician Skip James and accompanies the Soggy Bottom Boys, a band consisting of the film's three main protagonists plus Johnson, on \"Man of Constant Sorrow\".\n\nThe story of Johnson's selling his soul to the devil was first told by his brother, LaDell Johnson, and reported by David Evans in his 1971 biography of Johnson. This legend was subsequently attributed to the blues musician Robert Johnson.\n\nVictor Records, 1928, Memphis, Tennessee\n\nParamount Records, 1929, Grafton, Wisconsin\n\n"}

{"id": "2147274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147274", "title": "Supercritical fluid extraction", "text": "Supercritical fluid extraction\n\nSupercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is the process of separating one component (the extractant) from another (the matrix) using supercritical fluids as the extracting solvent. Extraction is usually from a solid matrix, but can also be from liquids. SFE can be used as a sample preparation step for analytical purposes, or on a larger scale to either strip unwanted material from a product (e.g. decaffeination) or collect a desired product (e.g. essential oils). These essential oils can include limonene and other straight solvents. Carbon dioxide (CO) is the most used supercritical fluid, sometimes modified by co-solvents such as ethanol or methanol. Extraction conditions for supercritical carbon dioxide are above the critical temperature of 31 °C and critical pressure of 74 bar. Addition of modifiers may slightly alter this. The discussion below will mainly refer to extraction with CO, except where specified.\n\nThe properties of the supercritical fluid can be altered by varying the pressure and temperature, allowing selective extraction. For example, volatile oils can be extracted from a plant with low pressures (100 bar), whereas liquid extraction would also remove lipids. Lipids can be removed using pure CO at higher pressures, and then phospholipids can be removed by adding ethanol to the solvent. The same principle can be used to extract polyphenols and unsaturated fatty acids separately from wine wastes.\n\nExtraction is a diffusion-based process, in which the solvent is required to diffuse into the matrix and the extracted material to diffuse out of the matrix into the solvent. Diffusivities are much faster in supercritical fluids than in liquids, and therefore extraction can occur faster. In addition, due to the lack of surface tension and negligible viscosities compared to liquids, the solvent can penetrate more into the matrix inaccessible to liquids. An extraction using an organic liquid may take several hours, whereas supercritical fluid extraction can be completed in 10 to 60 minutes.\n\nThe requirement for high pressures increases the cost compared to conventional liquid extraction, so SFE will only be used where there are significant advantages. Carbon dioxide itself is non-polar, and has somewhat limited dissolving power, so cannot always be used as a solvent on its own, particularly for polar solutes. The use of modifiers increases the range of materials which can be extracted. Food grade modifiers such as ethanol can often be used, and can also help in the collection of the extracted material, but reduces some of the benefits of using a solvent which is gaseous at room temperature.\n\nThe system must contain a pump for the CO, a pressure cell to contain the sample, a means of maintaining pressure in the system and a collecting vessel. The liquid is pumped to a heating zone, where it is heated to supercritical conditions. It then passes into the extraction vessel, where it rapidly diffuses into the solid matrix and dissolves the material to be extracted. The dissolved material is swept from the extraction cell into a separator at lower pressure, and the extracted material settles out. The CO can then be cooled, re-compressed and recycled, or discharged to atmosphere.\n\nCarbon dioxide () is usually pumped as a liquid, usually below 5 °C (41 °F) and a pressure of about 50 bar. The solvent is pumped as a liquid as it is then almost incompressible; if it were pumped as a supercritical fluid, much of the pump stroke would be \"used up\" in compressing the fluid, rather than pumping it. For small scale extractions (up to a few grams / minute), reciprocating pumps or syringe pumps are often used. For larger scale extractions, diaphragm pumps are most common. The pump heads will usually require cooling, and the CO will also be cooled before entering the pump.\n\nPressure vessels can range from simple tubing to more sophisticated purpose built vessels with quick release fittings. The pressure requirement is at least 74 bar, and most extractions are conducted at under 350 bar. However, sometimes higher pressures will be needed, such as extraction of vegetable oils, where pressures of 800 bar are sometimes required for complete miscibility of the two phases.\n\nThe vessel must be equipped with a means of heating. It can be placed inside an oven for small vessels, or an oil or electrically heated jacket for larger vessels. Care must be taken if rubber seals are used on the vessel, as the supercritical carbon dioxide may dissolve in the rubber, causing swelling, and the rubber will rupture on depressurization. \n\nThe pressure in the system must be maintained from the pump right through the pressure vessel. In smaller systems (up to about 10 mL / min) a simple restrictor can be used. This can be either a capillary tube cut to length, or a needle valve which can be adjusted to maintain pressure at different flow rates. In larger systems a back pressure regulator will be used, which maintains pressure upstream of the regulator by means of a spring, compressed air, or electronically driven valve. Whichever is used, heating must be supplied, as the adiabatic expansion of the CO results in significant cooling. This is problematic if water or other extracted material is present in the sample, as this may freeze in the restrictor or valve and cause blockages.\n\nThe supercritical solvent is passed into a vessel at lower pressure than the extraction vessel. The density, and hence dissolving power, of supercritical fluids varies sharply with pressure, and hence the solubility in the lower density CO is much lower, and the material precipitates for collection. It is possible to fractionate the dissolved material using a series of vessels at reducing pressure. The CO can be recycled or depressurized to atmospheric pressure and vented. For analytical SFE, the pressure is usually dropped to atmospheric, and the now gaseous carbon dioxide bubbled through a solvent to trap the precipitated components.\n\nThis is an important aspect. The fluid is cooled before pumping to maintain liquid conditions, then heated after pressurization. As the fluid is expanded into the separator, heat must be provided to prevent excessive cooling. For small scale extractions, such as for analytical purposes, it is usually sufficient to pre-heat the fluid in a length of tubing inside the oven containing the extraction cell. The restrictor can be electrically heated, or even heated with a hairdryer. For larger systems, the energy required during each stage of the process can be calculated using the thermodynamic properties of the supercritical fluid.\n\nThere are two essential steps to SFE, transport (by diffusion or otherwise) from with the solid particles to the surface, and dissolution in the supercritical fluid. Other factors, such as diffusion into the particle by the SF and reversible release such as desorption from an active site are sometimes significant, but not dealt with in detail here. Figure 2 shows the stages during extraction from a spherical particle where at the start of the extraction the level of extractant is equal across the whole sphere (Fig. 2a). As extraction commences, material is initially extracted from the edge of the sphere, and the concentration in the center is unchanged (Fig 2b). As the extraction progresses, the concentration in the center of the sphere drops as the extractant diffuses towards the edge of the sphere (Figure 2c).\n\nThe relative rates of diffusion and dissolution are illustrated by two extreme cases in Figure 3. Figure 3a shows a case where dissolution is fast relative to diffusion. The material is carried away from the edge faster than it can diffuse from the center, so the concentration at the edge drops to zero. The material is carried away as fast as it arrives at the surface, and the extraction is completely diffusion limited. Here the rate of extraction can be increased by increasing diffusion rate, for example raising the temperature, but not by increasing the flow rate of the solvent. Figure 3b shows a case where solubility is low relative to diffusion. The extractant is able to diffuse to the edge faster than it can be carried away by the solvent, and the concentration profile is flat. In this case, the extraction rate can be increased by increasing the rate of dissolution, for example by increasing flow rate of the solvent. \n\nThe extraction curve of % recovery against time can be used to elucidate the type of extraction occurring. Figure 4(a) shows a typical diffusion controlled curve. The extraction is initially rapid, until the concentration at the surface drops to zero, and the rate then becomes much slower. The % extracted eventually approaches 100%. Figure 4(b) shows a curve for a solubility limited extraction. The extraction rate is almost constant, and only flattens off towards the end of the extraction. Figure 4(c) shows a curve where there are significant matrix effects, where there is some sort of reversible interaction with the matrix, such as desorption from an active site. The recovery flattens off, and if the 100% value is not known, then it is hard to tell that extraction is less than complete.\n\nThe optimum will depend on the purpose of the extraction. For an analytical extraction to determine, say, antioxidant content of a polymer, then the essential factors are complete extraction in the shortest time. However, for production of an essential oil extract from a plant, then quantity of CO used will be a significant cost, and \"complete\" extraction not required, a yield of 70 - 80% perhaps being sufficient to provide economic returns. In another case, the selectivity may be more important, and a reduced rate of extraction will be preferable if it provides greater discrimination. Therefore, few comments can be made which are universally applicable. However, some general principles are outlined below.\n\nThis can be achieved by increasing the temperature, swelling the matrix, or reducing the particle size. Matrix swelling can sometimes be increased by increasing the pressure of the solvent, and by adding modifiers to the solvent. Some polymers and elastomers in particular are swelled dramatically by CO, with diffusion being increased by several orders of magnitude in some cases.\n\nGenerally, higher pressure will increase solubility. The effect of temperature is less certain, as close to the critical point, increasing the temperature causes decreases in density, and hence dissolving power. At pressures well above the critical pressure, solubility is likely to increase with temperature. Addition of low levels of modifiers (sometimes called entrainers), such as methanol and ethanol, can also significantly increase solubility, particularly of more polar compounds.\n\nThe flow rate of supercritical carbon dioxide should be measured in terms of mass flow rather than by volume because the density of the changes according to the temperature both before entering the pump heads and during compression. Coriolis flow meters are best used to achieve such flow confirmation. To maximize the rate of extraction, the flow rate should be high enough for the extraction to be completely diffusion limited (but this will be very wasteful of solvent). However, to minimize the amount of solvent used, the extraction should be completely solubility limited (which will take a very long time). Flow rate must therefore be determined depending on the competing factors of time and solvent costs, and also capital costs of pumps, heaters and heat exchangers. The optimum flow rate will probably be somewhere in the region where both solubility and diffusion are significant factors.\n\n\n"}

Five years later, in Chelsea, west London, the couple became next-door neighbours of Thomas Carlyle and Jane Welsh Carlyle, both of them notable writers. The Gilchrists' marriage, one of intellectual equals, was cut short when Alexander died of scarlet fever in 1861. Her daughter Beatrice had originally caught the disease and then her son, Percy, suffered it as his sister recovered. Her husband caught the disease from his son.\n\nShe was left with their four children: Percy, Beatrice, Herbert, and Grace. One of the reasons for the family's move to Philadelphia in 1876 was Beatrice's desire to attend medical school. Beatrice eventually became a physician in Edinburgh, but she killed herself shortly thereafter. Percy had a successful career developing a new and economic way of making steel and Herbert was a minor painter.\n\nAfter her husband's death in 1861, Anne completed his \"Life of Blake\" and was an active contributor to magazines.\n\nShe is perhaps best known for developing a deep attachment to Walt Whitman when she read \"Leaves of Grass\" in 1869, and for writing the first great criticism of that work, \"A Woman's Estimate of Walt Whitman\"; their correspondence was initiated through William Michael Rossetti. When she eventually travelled to Philadelphia, in 1876, she met Whitman and they formed a lasting friendship. She moved to New England in 1878, but returned to England the following year. In 1883, she published a biography of the writer Mary Lamb.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2147318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147318", "title": "Kong Yiji", "text": "Kong Yiji\n\nKong Yiji () is a short story by Lu Xun, the founder of modern Chinese literature. Originally published in April 1919 in the journal \"New Youth\" (新青年), it was later included in his first collection of short stories, \"A Call to Arms\" (吶喊). The story's narrator reminisces about Kong Yiji, an alcoholic failed scholar who frequented the tavern where the narrator worked when he was a boy. The story expresses Lu Xun's rejection of Classical Chinese in favour of the written vernacular Chinese which he helped pioneer. It is one of Lu Xun's best known and most analysed works.\n\nThe narrator reminisces about the time twenty years ago when he worked as a waiter in a tavern in Luzhen (魯鎮), a fictional town where many of Lu Xun's stories are set. Working class men wore short coats and drank standing at the counter, whereas the richer customers who wore long gowns sat and ate inside. Kong Yiji was the only customer who wore a long gown and stood. \n\nKong Yiji is a self-styled scholar who has failed to pass the xiucai examination but arrogantly fills his speech with muddled classical tags, refuses to perform menial work and steals to avoid starvation. He is treated with cruelty and contempt by the other customers, one of whom gave him the nickname \"Kong Yiji\" based on his real surname Kong and a meaningless sequence of characters from a children's elementary text. Although Kong Yiji is a thief, he makes a point of always settling his debts with the tavernkeeper. He tries to teach the narrator orthographic trivia, but the boy rejects him; when he ingratiates himself with the town's children, they laugh at him and cadge food. Later, Kong Yiji is caught stealing and beaten until his legs break. He drags himself to the tavern and orders some wine, after which he is not seen again and presumably dies as a result of his injuries. The tavernkeeper remembers Kong Yiji's unpaid bills for a while, but he is otherwise forgotten.\n\nWritten before the May Fourth Movement, this piece is the second Vernacular Chinese story written by Lu Xun after writing A Madman's Diary.\n\nSome people believe that Lu Xun wrote this story to express the unhappiness of the university students at that time. Others have suggested that Lu Xun wrote the story to explain the problems with China's feudal society, where people could waste their entire lives trying to pass meaningless examinations and where people were selfish and completely indifferent to the plight of others. Lu Xun rejected the traditional Chinese system of education geared towards the imperial examinations, and of the cruelty of Chinese society.\n\n"}

After distrustful farmers tried and failed to repeal the testing program, they gathered in numbers to block tests from taking place. Such confrontations sometimes led to violence. Subsequently, the Republican Governor Dan Turner of Iowa declared martial law and called out Iowa National Guard troops to restore peace and to assist in capturing the ringleaders Jake Lenker and Paul Moore.\n\nThe State of Iowa required the tests to reduce the frequency with which dairy cattle with tuberculosis would contaminate the milk supply and cause milk-drinking humans to contract the disease. An Iowa law passed in 1929 required all dairy and breeding cattle be tested by veterinarians. Any animal that showed signs of infection was to be destroyed. The owner was paid an indemnity. The program was financed by a property tax levy of up to 3 mills.\n\nThe adoption of the testing program unfortunately coincided with the Great Depression. Farmers already impoverished by low prices for their milk and beef viewed the testing program as another threat to their livelihood. They claimed that the test was unreliable and caused abortions in cattle. They also asserted that the test lowered the quality of milk and reduced a cow's milk output.\n\nIn February 1931, two years after the adoption of the testing law, an estimated one thousand farmers went by special train from Tipton, Iowa (in Cedar County, Iowa) to Iowa's Capitol in Des Moines. On arrival, they demanded that Iowa Legislature make the tests optional rather than mandatory. After the Legislature refused to act, farmers began to take things into their own hands.\n\nIn rural areas of southeast Iowa, veterinarians attempting to test cattle were increasingly met by large groups of farmers mobilized to obstruct the tests. They were subjected to minor levels of violence, such as thrown eggs or mud, and kicks from farm wives.\n\nIn areas where testing had been frustrated, Iowa officials responded by providing veterinarians with escorts from law officers. This came to a head on September 21, 1931 at the Jake Lenker farm south of Tipton. Two veterinarians convoyed by 65 officers appeared at the farm. Barring the way were 400 farmers. Violence flared. The following day, Iowa Governor Dan Turner declared martial law and sent 31 Iowa National Guard units to Tipton. The effect of this show of force was dramatic. As Iowa historian George Mills explained decades later, \"Objecting farmers gave in almost without exception to the show of force.\" When all of the tests were completed (often under armed guard), the conflict also ended.\n\nUltimately, Lenker and another leader of the revolt, Paul Moore, were arrested and convicted of criminal conspiracy, and sentenced to three-year terms in the Iowa State Pentitentiary in Fort Madison, Iowa. Each was paroled well before the end of his sentence.\nThe Iowa Cow War had ended by 1935 .\n"}

{"id": "2147346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147346", "title": "Dan W. Turner", "text": "Dan W. Turner\n\nDaniel Webster \"Dan\" Turner (March 17, 1877April 15, 1969) was an American Republican politician who served as the 25th Governor of Iowa from 1931 until 1933.\n\nDaniel Webster Turner, named after the famed antebellum senator and orator, was born on a farm near Corning, Iowa. As a boy, he did farm chores and clerked at the general store owned by his father, a civil war veteran. Graduating from the Corning Academy in 1898, he enlisted in the Army and served in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War. He boxed in the division championship fights and won, but suffered a broken nose that became a permanent facial feature. Returning from the war, he joined the National Guard and rose to the rank of major. In 1903, at age 26, he was elected to the Iowa Senate. His political activism and boxer’s nose led the press to dub him, “Fighting Dan Turner.”\n\nAs a representative of the progressive wing of the Republican Party during the era of “prairie populism,” when the Midwest was a font of radicalism, Turner advocated for many reforms. In a 1912 address to the Republican State Convention, he defended the anti-trust law and called for direct election of U. S. senators, income and corporate taxes as more equitable than property taxes, and an end to corrupt leadership, saying, “We must cleanse our party of complacent plutocrats and corpulent freebooters, masquerading as Republicans.” Elected to the Governorship in 1931, he attacked lobbyists in his inaugural address and demanded fair congressional districts, measures to promote child welfare, and establishing a state conservation commission:\n\n“The professional lobbyist . . . should be ejected from the presence of honest men . . . . He is not interested in the well being of the people we represent.”\n\n“Our streams are rapidly degenerating into open sewers, receiving the waste drainage of private industry and municipalities. We must terminate this practice.” \n\nIn a prelude to the Great Depression, the farming economy collapsed during the 1920s, with many related bank failures. Turner, as a \"Son of the Wild Jackass\" and one of four speakers at the Republican National Convention of 1928, urged the party to support farm relief. He traveled twice to Washington to unsuccessfully plead the same cause with President Hoover during the 1930s.\n\nTurner played a decisive role in the Iowa Cow War of 1931. To keep people from contracting bovine tuberculosis, a State law mandated testing of dairy cows and destroying diseased animals. Farmers across Iowa responded with suspicion and hostility. When some banded together near Tipton, Iowa to prevent the tests from taking place and violence broke out, Turner as governor restored peace by calling out the Iowa National Guard. This act earned him the enmity of many farmers and may have contributed to his re-election defeat in 1932 by Democrat Clyde L. Herring, though this was the year of the Roosevelt-led Democratic sweep, when Republicans were removed from office nationwide.\n\nReturning to the race for governor of Iowa in 1934, Turner was defeated a second time by Herring. He did not run for office again but remained active in politics. He supported fellow Republican Dwight Eisenhower in the presidential race of 1952, but turned against Eisenhower after a meeting with the President yielded disappointment on farm-related matters. In the election of 1956, he crossed party lines and supported Democrat Adlai Stevenson for president. Still advocating for farmers’ interests at age 78, he was active in founding the National Farmers Organization, recalling Thomas Jefferson when he cited the “yeoman farmer, who has been the bulwark of our nation.”\n\nAt the end of his life, remembering his part in the Spanish–American War, Turner was heard to say, “They gave us the Springfield rifle. I wish I had never learned to shoot it. They said we were fighting for liberty, but it was cruel, it was cruel.” He died in Corning at age 92 and is buried there in Walnut Grove Cemetery.\n\nSinger-songwriter Glen Phillips of Toad The Wet Sprocket is a great-great-nephew of Gov. Turner.\n"}

He is currently a NASCAR driver with occasional appearances for the Virginia Lottery at Martinsville Speedway, Richmond International Raceway, and Bristol Motor Speedway; in 2019, he drove the No. 93 Chevrolet Camaro in the NASCAR Xfinity Series for RSS Racing. He was also a pit reporter with Fox Sports 1 for Xfinity and NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series broadcasts.\n\nSadler began racing in go-karts alongside younger brother Elliott in their hometown of Emporia. He then began running late models in Virginia. In 1992, Sadler made his debut in the NASCAR Busch Series at Orange County Speedway. He started 19th but finished 25th after wrecking his No. 32 Oldsmobile. He ran four more races that season, with a best finish of 20th, at Dover International Speedway and Hickory Motor Speedway.\n\nSadler began running the Busch Series full-time in 1993. Driving the No. 25 Shell Oil-Virginia is for Lovers-sponsored Oldsmobile for Don Beverly, Sadler picked a win at Orange County, finished tenth in points, and was named NASCAR Busch Grand National Series Rookie of the Year. He followed that up with another win at Orange County and a fifth-place points finish the next season in 1994. After that year ended, Sadler teamed with his father, Herman, to run the No. 1 DeWalt Tools-sponsored Chevrolet. Although he did not win, Sadler had six Top 10 finishes and a thirteenth-place finish in the point standings. He won the pole at the 1996 Milwaukee Mile race, but he continued to drop and finished 15th place in points. He also made his debut in the Winston Cup Series, starting 30th and finishing 37th at the Miller 400 in the No. 26 Chevrolet owned by William Slate.\n\nIn 1997, his ride was purchased by Diamond Ridge Motorsports, which also owned Elliott's current ride. Sadler grabbed two more poles and had seven Top 10 finishes, finishing tenth in points. After a nearly identical season in 1998, Sadler was pushed out of the ride, while Elliott signed with Wood Brothers Racing in the Cup Series.\n\nIn 1999, Sadler signed to drive the No. 72 MGM Brakes-sponsored Chevy for Ron Parker. But a season-opening failure to qualify, at the NAPA Auto Parts 300, brought an end to the streak of 173 consecutive races for Sadler. After his release from the team following the MBNA Platinum 200, Sadler spent the rest of the season with BACE Motorsports' Bayer-Alka-Seltzer-sponsored entry, and then Innovative Motorsports. In 2000, Sadler signed to drive the No. 30 Little Trees-sponsored Chevy for Innovative, but often did not qualify for races, and was released after six events. After a brief stint of Innovative using interim drivers, Sadler returned to the team for the balance of the season, posting a seventh-place finish at Pikes Peak International Raceway.\n\nIn 2001, Sadler and his wife Angela formed their own team, Score Motorsports, and began running a limited schedule in the Winston Cup Series. Running cars purchased from Larry Hedrick Motorsports and with Virginia Lottery sponsoring, he ran three races, his best finish being a 27th at Dover. Sadler returned to the Busch Series in 2002, running a limited schedule in his own No. 02 as well as the No. 43 for the Curb Agajanian Performance Group. His best finish was a 21st at Richmond. Sadler also ran 10 Cup races that year, eight in his own No. 02 entry, and two races for Junie Donlavey.\n\nFor 2003, Sadler announced he would run the No. 54 Toys R Us-sponsored Chevy in the Busch Series for Team Bristol Motorsports. Ten races into the season, the team shut down following the Hardee's 250 due to financial difficulties. Sadler ended that Busch Season running three races on his own with Zapf Creations sponsoring. He also ran ten more Cup races in the No. 02 that season, with sponsors such as Dollar Tree, Go Team VA, and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Former NBA player Bryant Stith became a co-owner of Score in 2004, and with help from fan donations, Sadler was able to run 30 Busch races, the best finish being a twelfth at Milwaukee. He also ran 16 races in the Cup Series, and had a 23rd-place finish at Talladega Superspeedway, as well as fielding cars for Carl Long and Andy Belmont. As a team owner, Sadler was the last to compete in a Pontiac, which had pulled out of NASCAR after the 2003 season.\n\nDuring the lead-up to 2005, Sadler sold his Busch Series team and announced he was selling a large portion of his Cup team to Jeff Stec, owner of Peak Fitness, who would sponsor the new No. 66 car. Sadler continued to struggle despite the new ownership, and resigned from the ride midseason. He spent the balance of the year driving occasional races for Front Row Motorsports, and even returned to the No. 66 for one race in a sponsorship deal with Jerry Kilgore.\n\nIn 2006, Sadler ran seven races for MBA Racing, racing the No. 00 Aaron's Rent-sponsored Ford as a partnership with the Michael Waltrip Racing team. Sadler made one start at Martinsville Speedway in 2007 and 2008, driving Chevrolet Silverados for Andy Hillenburg. He ran three truck races for Hillenburg in 2010.\n\nSadler returned to the Busch Series (now Xfinity Series) for the first time in over five years in 2010, and raced at Richmond in the No. 09 car, sponsored by TNA Impact!, finishing six laps down, in 32nd position. He made two additional starts in Busch that season in the No. 27 Baker Curb Racing Ford, but failed to finish higher than 30th. He made six truck races for Hillenburg, and raced in the 2010 TUMS Fast Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway, driving for TRG Motorsports. It was his first start in four years in NASCAR Sprint Cup competition and the team cited his prior success at Martinsville as the best chance for TRG to remain in the Top 35; TRG entered Martinsville just fifteen points ahead of 35th and twenty points in front of the 36th place team. Sadler finished 26th and the TRG maintained its top-35 status, and he ran three additional Cup races for TRG in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Richard Childress Racing gave him a start in the No. 33 Sprint Cup car at Martinsville in the Goody's Fast Relief 500. Anderson's Maple Syrup sponsored the entry, and Sadler finished 31st at his home track. After sitting out in 2013, Sadler returned to racing late in 2014, driving the late season Nationwide Series short track races at Bristol and Richmond for Tri-Star Motorsports. He piloted the No. 19 Toyota Camry usually driven by Mike Bliss, with Bliss moving to the team's No. 10 entry for these events. The Virginia Lottery sponsored the ride for Sadler. His only starts in 2015 came for JGL Racing at Bristol and Richmond, with Virginia Lottery continuing to sponsor.\n\nAfter a five-year absence from the Cup Series, Sadler drove the No. 7 Chevy for Premium Motorsports at the 2017 First Data 500 at Martinsville Speedway; after starting the race last, he finished 34th.\n\nOn November 17, 2019, Sadler tweeted he had departed \"Fox NASCAR\".\n\nIn 2002 Sadler had a feud in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling with Ron Killings, and a number of appearances and matches as part of a cross promotion between TNA and NASCAR. TNA later sponsored Sadler's racing efforts.\n\nAs of March 27, 2009, he has been hosting an online web cast show entitled Hermie's Hotseat that can be seen on TNA's YouTube channel where Sadler does candid sit-down interviews with the performers and employees of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.\n\nHermie started the United Wrestling Federation, wrestling promotion in 2005. At first, the company worked with TNA Wrestling bringing house shows under the TNA/UWF moniker to areas like Detroit, Philadelphia, and other parts of the east coast. Hermie wrestled part-time in his promotion as well, teaming with Rhino, Jeff Hardy, Team 3D, and others.\n\nIn late 2006, the UWF ceased co-promoting with TNA and began independent operations in 2007, although they continue to use the six-sided ring that TNA utilized at the time. At a show in Richmond, Virginia on September 29, 2006, Hermie presented a $10,000 check to an autism foundation. On December 5, 2007 he signed with TNA as an announcer.\n\nIt was announced on April 21, 2014 that Sadler joined the board of directors for Jeff Jarrett's Global Force Wrestling.\n\nSadler graduated from the University of North Carolina and is an avid North Carolina Tar Heels sports fan. Married February 3, 1996, he and his wife Angie have three daughters -– Cora, Halie and Naomi. As of 2017, his daughter Cora is a cheerleader at the University of North Carolina. Sadler has publicly talked about his daughter Halie being on the autism spectrum.\n\n"}
{"id": "2147354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147354", "title": "Abismo Negro", "text": "Abismo Negro\n\nAndrés Alejandro Palomeque González (July 1, 1971 – March 22, 2009) was a Mexican luchador (Spanish for \"masked professional wrestler\"). He is best known for appearing under the stage name Abismo Negro, which is Spanish for \"Black Abyss\", in the Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) promotion. Before appearing under the ring name Abismo Negro, Palomeque worked for five years under the alias \"[the] Winners\" and before that also wrestled as the characters \"Alex Dinamo\", \"Pequeño Samurai\", and \"Furor\" for short periods. Palomeque owned and operated the \"Gimnasio Abismo Negro\", a wrestling school where individuals were trained to become professional wrestlers.\n\nIn his professional wrestling career, Palomeque worked for the two most prominent professional wrestling promotions in Mexico: Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and AAA. He also worked for the North American–based promotions the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) due to talent exchange programs between AAA and WWF in 1997 and TNA in 2004, as well as making appearances for the Michinoku Pro and Pro Wrestling Noah promotions in Japan.\n\nOn March 22, 2009, Palomeque was found dead in a river near El Rosario, Sinaloa; the official cause of death was listed as drowning. On the night before, a wrestler using the Abismo Negro outfit worked an AAA show pretending to be Palomeque; this incident caused the promoter to be barred from promoting shows for two years. Palomeque was inducted into the AAA Hall of Fame in June 2013.\n\nAndrés Alejandro Palomeque González was born July 1, 1971, in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico. Palomeque started to get interested in professional wrestling at the age of nine when his father, Juan Francisco Palomeque Torres, took him to his first wrestling event. Later the Palomeque Family moved to Poza Rica where a young Palomeque took up Pentathlon (long jump, high jump, 110 metres hurdles run, shot put, 1500 metres run) in school. He and his brother, César Palomeque, had an interest in Martial Arts and trained together for years. When Palomeque was thirteen years old he began working in a gymnasium where professional wrestlers were trained, initially he paid for the use of the gymnasium by cleaning it after hours. When the family moved back to the Tabasco region he began training under Don Nerio Soto, who worked under the ring name \"El Noruego\" (the Norwegian), and his brother Delio Soto to become a luchador, or professional wrestler. Professional wrestlers perform in a non-competitive sport based on simulated fighting with storylines written by creative teams and matches with predetermined results. Don Soto later recollects how he and his family took the young man in and made him part of their family, practically adopting him while he was enrolled in Soto's wrestling school and later as he worked on the local wrestling circuit. Palomeque made his professional wrestling debut in 1987, at the age of 16, under the ring name \"Alex Dinamo\".\n\nPalomeque received further training from famous Mexican wrestling coaches Diablo Velasco and Ray Mendoza before changing his character and ring name to \"Pequeño Samurai\"—a masked persona patterned after the Japanese Samurai tradition. In 1991, Palomeque began working for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL; Spanish for \"World Wrestling Council\"), the biggest wrestling promotion in Mexico at that time. In CMLL, he worked as Furor, another masked ring persona. While working as Furor, Palomeque won his first \"Luchas de apuestas\", or \"bet match\" when he defeated his mentor El Noruego in a match where Noruego's hair and Palomeque's mask was at stake.\n\nIn 1992 CMLL head writer Antonio Peña left the company to create his own wrestling promotion Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA; Spanish for \"Assistance, Consulting and Administration\") promotion; Palomeque was one of the many young wrestlers who left CMLL to work for the newly formed AAA. In AAA, his ring personal was changed and he became \"Winners\" (sometimes written Winner's), a fan favorite character (known as a \"Técnico\" in Lucha Libre) who wore a silver bodysuit and mask. Palomeques work as \"Winners\" earned him a match on the very first Triplemanía where he teamed with Super Caló and El Salsero to defeat the team of May Flowers, Rudy Reyna, and Baby Sharon in a Six Man Tag Team match. The following year at Triplemanía II-A he teamed up with Rey Misterio and Rey Misterio Jr. to defeat the team known as \"Los Destructores\" (Tony Arce, Vulcano, and Rocco Valente). In 1995, Winners participated in a Relevos Suicidas Tag Team match, in which the losing team members have a match of their own, with the loser of that encounter being forced to unmask. Winners team won the match, keeping him from having to defend his mask in a match. Eight days later at Triplemanía III-B, Winners' mask was on the line in a match against Marabunta; Winners defeated Marabunta in a \"Luchas de Apuestas\", Mask vs. Mask match. On June 30, 1995, at Triplemanía III-C, Winners participated in another \"mask vs. mask\" match, his third in three weeks. This time, Winners was not successful, as he lost to Super Caló and was forced to unmask. The loss of the mask did not hurt Winners' popularity, on the contrary it intensified as the hansome Palomeque became even more popular with the female fans. Despite losing his mask to Super Caló the two continued to work together as a team. On June 15, 1996, Winners and Caló teamed up with Rey Misterio Jr. and Oro Jr. to defeat the team of Perro Silva, Halloween, Kraken, and Mosco de la Merced at Triplemanía IV-B. A month later, Winners, Caló, La Parka and El Mexicano defeated Jerry Estrada, Fishman, Villano IV, and May Flowers in one of the featured matches of Triplemanía IV-C.\n\nIn January 1997, Palomeque's character was changed from that of the quintessential heroic ladies' man known as \"Winners\", to that of a cheating villain (referred to as a \"Rudo\") known as \"Abismo Negro\". Part of his new routine as Abismo Negro was a flamethrower display, created by using a lighter and an Aerosol spray can. Palomeque would regularly use this during his entrance and on occasion during a match as when he worked as \"Abismo Negro\" character. As part of his Rudo act Palomeque began using the \"Marinete\" — a wrestling move known as a Piledriver where he simulates driving the top of his opponents' head into the mat — the Marinete is \"banned\" Mexican wrestling, which means that it can lead to a disqualification if used during the match. The Marinete became such a signature move for the Abismo Negro character that he earned the nickname \"El Rey del Martinete\" (The King of the Piledriver). He made his debut as Abismo Negro on January 10, 1997, in an Eight Man Tag Team match. Shortly after his debut as Abismo Negro, he made his World Wrestling Federation (WWF) debut on the January 19, 1997, episode of the WWF Free For All pay-per-view event pre–show before the 1997 Royal Rumble. On the telecast, Negro teamed with Heavy Metal and Histeria in a losing effort against the team of Octagón, Blue Demon Jr., and Tinieblas Jr. in a six-man tag team match. This match was one of the early results of a working relationship between the WWF and AAA that had been created in late 1996. The relationship saw Negro make an appearance in January against Perro Aguayo Jr. and two appearances on the WWF's primary television program \"Monday Night Raw\" in March 1997. During his appearances in March, Negro was announced as being part of Los Vipers, a recently created alliance of wrestlers. After March, Negro did not make any more appearances for the WWF.\n\nIn AAA, Cibernético formed Los Vipers with Negro along with Psicosis (II), Mosco De La Merced, Maniaco and Histeria. Histeria was replaced a few weeks later by Histeria II. In 1998, Negro acquired a \"mascot\": a midget wrestler called Mini Abismo Negro. Abismo, Mini Abismo, and new Vipers member Electroshock were defeated by Octagón, his mascot Octagóncito, and Pentagón in a six-man tag team match at Triplemanía. Los Vipers engaged in several scripted rivalries with other AAA groups, such as the group of masked wrestlers dressed as clowns known as Los Payasos. They also had a long-running rivalry with Los Vatos Locos—consisting of Espiritu, Picudo, Nygma, May Flowers, and Silver Cat during the rivalry—over the Mexican National Atómicos Championship. Los Vipers won the Atómicos titles from Los Vatos on several occasions, but Negro was not part of the teams that won. Palomeque wrestling as Abismo Negro did capture a title of his own when he defeated Pentagón on May 19, 1998, to win the Mexican National Middleweight Championship, a title he held until January 1999.\n\nIn 1999, Los Vipers split into two factions, with Abismo Negro leading a splinter group called \"Los Vipers Extreme\" consisting of Electroshock, Pentagón, Shiima, El Cuervo and Mini Abismo Negro while Cibernético created a group called \"Los Vipers Primera Clase\" (First Class Vipers). After less than two months, the angle was dropped and Los Vipers reunited. Not long after Los Vipers reunited, Cibernético formed a group called Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was inspired by World Championship Wrestling's New World Order. Los Vipers became a subgroup within LLL, and Negro assumed leadership of Los Vipers. On May 2, 1999, Negro and Electroshock teamed up to defeat Perro Aguayo and Perro Aguayo Jr. to win the Mexican National Tag Team Championship. Los Vipers held the tag team title for four months before losing it to the team of Haytor and the Panther.\n\nIn 2000, Palomeque participated in a AAA tour of Japan and competed at Triplemanía VIII, where he was on the losing side of an eight-man tag team match main event; Negro teamed with Cibernetico, Shiima Nobunaga and Electro Shock against Octagón, Jushin Thunder Liger, Latin Lover and Cuije. While touring with AAA, Palomeuqe also made an appearance at Michinoku Pro's April 9 Sumo Hall card, where he defeated Oriental. On May 7, Abismo Negro and Electroshock regained the Mexican National Tag Team title by defeating Haytor and the Panther but only held on to the title for two months before losing it to Héctor Garza and Perro Aguayo Jr.\n\nNegro became one of the driving forces in LLL's feud with AAA owner Antonio Peña and his AAA loyalists. Over the years, Negro feuded with the top técnicos of AAA such as La Parka Jr., Octagón and Latin Lover. Negro's position as one of AAA's top workers was cemented on March 5, 2000, when he competed in AAA's annual Rey de Reyes tournament. In the opening round, he defeated Dos Caras, Killer and Psicosis II and in the finals, he defeated El Alebrije, Charly Manson and Cibernético to win the 2000 Rey de Reyes tournament. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead Los Vipers. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo (2000). When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerra de Titanes (2000), the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put on the back burner. In 2001, Negro almost won Rey de Reyes again, but La Parka Jr. defeated him in the finals. His string of losses continued at Triplemanía IX, where the LLL team of Abismo Negro, Cibernético, Electroshock and Mascara Maligna lost to Mascara Sagrada, El Alebrije, Octagón and La Parka Jr. when Negro was forced to submit.\n\nIn 2000 Abismo Negro won the hair of the Panther in \"Lucha del reves\" match, a contest where two masked wrestlers put their hair on the line instead of their mask. On September 7, 2001 Abismo Negro won another Lucha del reves match, defeating El Alebrije. In December 2002, Negro and Mini Abismo Negro made it to the finals of a tournament to crown the first ever AAA Mascot Tag Team Champions but lost to Mascara Sagrada and Mascarita Sagrada. Negro qualified for the Rey de Reyes (2003) final, but La Parka Jr. once again defeated him. In 2004, LLL was phased out in favor of a new super group known as \"La Legión Extranjera\" or the Foreign Legion in English, which meant that Los Vipers now regularly teamed with foreign wrestlers, especially NWA-TNA performers such as Abyss.\n\nIn 2004, TNA and AAA began a working relationship that saw TNA wrestlers work in Mexico and AAA wrestlers make several appearances on TNA's weekly pay-per-views. Managed by AAA owner Antonio Peña, Palomeque, working as Abismo Negro, along with Héctor Garza, Juventud Guerrera, Mr. Águila, and later Heavy Metal, worked for TNA as Team AAA in the TNA 2004 America's X Cup Tournament. The team made their debut on January 28, 2004, at TNA Weekly pay-per-view event #78, defeating the team of Eric Young, Shark Boy, Matt Stryker and Chad Collyer. In the following weeks, Negro and Team AAA won against Elix Skipper, the team of Jerry Lynn and Sonjay Dutt and finally all of Team USA in a 4 on 4 match to claim the Americas X Cup. Four weeks later Team AAA successfully defended the X Cup against Team Canada, as Abismo Negro and Juventud Guerrera defeated the team of Teddy Hart and Jack Evans to tie the score between the two teams, allowing for a final four-on-four elimination match that Team AAA won.\n\nAbismo Negro and the rest of Team AAA returned for the 2004 World X Cup Tournament where they now competed as \"Team Mexico\". Abismo Negro remained undefeated until April 7, 2004, when his team lost to James Mason and Jason Allgood in one of the first matches of the World X Cup Tournament. Later in the night, Team Mexico defeated Team UK to even the score. The World Cup saw Team Mexico lose to Team USA, Team Canada (Eric Young and Bobby Roode), and Team Japan (Ryuji Hijikata and Mitsu Hirai Jr.). Team Mexico tied in points with Team USA and Team Canada, which meant that a representative of each team met in an Ultimate X match to determine the winner of the tournament. Héctor Garza represented Mexico, but in the end Team USA's Chris Sabin won the match and the tournament.\n\nAfter the World X Cup tournament ended, Negro returned to AAA full-time taking full charge of Los Vipers. In early 2005, he was once again involved in the final match of that year's Rey de Reyes, but La Parka Jr. defeated him for the third time. AAA hinted at a possible técnico turn when Negro, along with Psicosis and Mini Psicosis, attacked Cibernético. The two faced off in a cage match, won by Cibernético, but they eventually reconciled their differences once more. At some point after 2005, Abismo Negro won the hair of Stuka Jr. in a Lucha del reves match. Despite rumors that he was jumping to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre, Negro remained in AAA and was sent on a tour with Pro Wrestling Noah in the spring of 2006. Later in the year, he finally turned técnico and began a sustained storyline with Cibernético and his group La Secta Cibernetica. The on again, off again storyline with Cibernético was put on hold when Cibernético suffered a severe knee injury in late 2006. At some point during 2006, Los Vipers left La Legión due to their \"Anti-Mexican\" philosophy and began fighting La Legión and La Legión's imported wrestlers. At Verano de Escandalo (2006), Negro, Charly Manson, Electroshock and Histeria lost to Team TNA (Homicide, Low Ki, Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles).\n\nIn late 2007, AAA created a ring persona for a new wrestler called Black Abyss; the gimmick featured the same mask and attire as Negro and used a similar wrestling style to Negro as well. Initially, it was believed that this was done because there were rumors of him jumping to CMLL or to cover several no-shows. In 2008, Negro's \"almost winning\" streak at Rey de Reyes continued as he lost in the final to El Zorro. Black Abyss made sure Negro did not win but interfering on Zorro's behalf during the match, furthering the storyline between the two. During the fall of 2008, AAA pushed the storyline further by having Black Abyss \"injure\" Negro with his own trademark move the \"Martinete\". Abismo Negro was scheduled to take part in Triplemanía XVI in a match where he would face Los Vipers (Psicosis, Histeria, Black Abyss and Mr. Niebla) in a cage match, but in the weeks leading up to the show Abismo Negro suffered an injury and the match had to be cancelled, AAA used the attack at Rey de Reyes as a storyline explanation of why the match did not take place. At the 2008 Guerra de Titanes, Negro returned to challenge Los Vipers' Revolution and specifically Black Abyss. Subsequently, the storyline between Negro and Black Abyss seemed to be building to a Luchas de Apuestas fight between the two, with their masks on the line. Both Abismo and Black Abyss were booked in the same four-way elimination match qualifier at the Rey de Reyes (2009) event. Negro was able to eliminate Black Abyss from the match but was in turn eliminated by Latin Lover. Black Abyss still competed under the Black Abyss name, still as a rudo, but seemingly only a couple times on TV since then. Black Abyss has stated his wishes to continue with the character to honor the memory of Abismo Negro, but AAA didn't shown a lot of interest in using it on TV. In October 2010 it was reported that Black Abyss had left AAA.\n\nOn September 27, 2011, AAA announced the start of a competition to find a new Abismo Negro. In the end no one was chosen to take over the Abismo Negro character.\n\nPalomeque was married to a woman named Martha for 15 years and the couple had four children, two girls and two boys. Palomeque's wife has been suffering from breast cancer for a number of years.\n\nHe often appeared on the morning television program \"Vida TV\", in full wrestling gear and persona, billed as Abismo Negro. He usually appeared as a kind of judge for talent contests on the show earning him the nickname \"Fiscal De Hierro de la Televisión\" (the Iron Judge of Television). Palomeque owned and operated \"Gimnasio Abismo Negro\" where he taught both professional wrestling and physical fitness. Graduates of Abismo Negro's wrestling school include Independent wrestling workers El Intocable, Extassis and Mini Cibernético as well as AAA workers Sexy Star and Aero Star. Abismo Negro is a playable character in AAA's first ever video game, \"AAA El Videojuego\". The Abismo Negro character was one of the first characters used to promote the game and show the quality of the graphic rendering.\n\nPalomeque was found dead on March 22, 2009. His body was found in a river near the town of El Rosario, Sinaloa. According to a bus driver who was transporting Palomeque and other passengers to Mexico City on Friday night March 20, Palomeque became agitated, panicked and demanded to be let off the bus despite it being 1:30 in the morning. A text message he sent to his wife after leaving the bus confirms that Palomeque found himself lost on the dark hillside. After receiving the text message, his wife contacted local wrestling promoter Vicente Martinez, who organized a search party. On the morning of March 22, Palomeque was found floating face down in the river. Afterwards, medical expert Jesús Enrique Castro López stated that such an anxiety attack could be steroid related, but Palomeque's alleged steroid abuse has not been confirmed. An autopsy was carried out on March 23, which determined that the cause of death was drowning, and no further investigation into the death is planned. A memorial was held in Mexico City on March 24 for friends and family of Palomeque, many of whom showed up without their masks on, to keep the focus of the event on Palomeque. His body was subsequently cremated, with the ashes taken to Villahermosa to be buried.\n\nOn Saturday March 21, while Palomeque was either lost in the hills or already dead, someone worked as Abismo Negro on an AAA show in Cancun. In the past, the wrestler known as Black Abyss had worked as Abismo Negro when Palomeque failed to show, but this time Black Abyss was not the man behind the mask, as he was on the opposing team that night. Following the discovery of Palomeque's body, the deception in Cancun received national coverage in Mexico and the local promoter responsible for the show, Renán Martínez, was suspended for two years by the Benito Júarez Boxing and Wrestling commission.\n\nOn October 26, 2009 AAA held the \"Torneo Abismo Negro\" in honor of Palomeque, the tournament was a 7-man gauntlet-style match and included a mix of five AAA veterans and two Abismo Negro students. The participants were Cuervo, Black Abyss, Gato Eveready, Kempo Dragon, Joe Lider, Extreme Tiger and Relámpago. Relámpago, Abismo Negro's last student to turn professional, won the match after 48 minutes. The event was not televised and did not become an annual event. During Triplemania XVII there was a moment of silence in memory of Abismo Negro, Antonio Peña and Mitsuharu Misawa (Misawa had died the night before).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2147371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147371", "title": "Johnny Sauter", "text": "Johnny Sauter\n\nJonathan Joseph \"Johnny\" Sauter (born May 1, 1978) is an American professional stock car racing driver currently competing full-time in the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series, driving the No. 13 Ford F-150 for ThorSport Racing. Sauter is the son of former NASCAR driver Jim Sauter, the brother of NASCAR drivers Tim Sauter and Jay Sauter, and the uncle of Travis Sauter. He is the 2016 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series champion.\n\nAfter graduating high school in 1996, Sauter began competing in various amateur series throughout Wisconsin and the Midwest. By the end of 1997, Sauter had collected three wins in the Sportsman Division at Dells Raceway Park and a win in the Late Model Division at the La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway. Sauter then joined the American Speed Association Series in 1998. By 2001, he was the ASA Series Champion.\n\nIn 2001, following Sauter's ASA Championship, Richard Childress Racing invited him to drive the No. 21 Rockwell Automation-sponsored Chevrolet in five Busch Series races. Sauter finished in the Top 15 in three of his five Busch starts, including a fifth-place finish in the AutoLite Fram 250 at Richmond, which was his first start in the series. \nIn 2002, Childress hired Sauter to run a full Busch Series schedule in the No. 2 AC Delco-sponsored Chevrolet. He notched five Top 10 finishes, including his first Busch Series win in the Tropicana Twister 300 at the Chicagoland Speedway, despite skipping one race. Sauter was involved in one of the biggest accidents in NASCAR history in the Aaron's 312 at Talladega, where 33 of 43 cars were involved, and 15 of them were taken out of the race. In 2003, Sauter drove for Childress Racing and the Curb Agajanian Performance Group in the Busch Series, piloting the No. 21 PayDay-sponsored Chevrolet and the No. 43 Channellock/Curb Records-sponsored Chevrolet. He captured 14 Top 10 finishes in 34 Busch Series starts, including a win at Richmond in the No. 43. Sauter finished the 2003 season eighth in the driver standings and, together with Kevin Harvick, led the No. 21 car to the owners' points championship. \n\nDuring the 2003 season, Sauter also made his Winston Cup debut, driving the No. 4 Kodak Easy Share-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix for five races with Morgan-McClure Motorsports. His best start in five races was a 23rd at Loudon, and he also missed a race at Kansas Speedway. He also ran three races in the Craftsman Truck Series for Fasscore Motorsports, and had a tenth-place run at Richmond. Childress hired Sauter to drive the No. 30 AOL-sponsored Chevrolet in Winston Cup full-time in 2004. After thirteen races, he was replaced by Dave Blaney, but later attempted two races in Childress' No. 33 car, but did not qualify for either of them. Towards the end of the season, he began running the No. 09 Miccosukee Gaming & Resorts-sponsored Dodge Intrepid for Phoenix Racing, and had a best finish of 29th. He also ran a full Busch schedule with Brewco Motorsports that season, driving the No. 27 Kleenex-sponsored Pontiac to an 18th-place points finish.\n\nSauter joined Phoenix full-time in 2005, with Yellow Transportation becoming the team's primary sponsor. He had 11 Top 10 finishes and a win at his home track at Milwaukee, and improved his position in points to twelfth for the year. However, Sauter was disqualified at Texas after his car failed a post-race inspection. Sauter and Phoenix also competed in ten Cup races, posting a ninth-place finish at Phoenix.\n\nAfter the 2005 season, Sauter and Yellow moved to the No. 00 Haas CNC Racing Chevrolet for the next season. He had one pole and nine top-tens, and tied his best finish of eighth in series points. He made one Cup start that season that year at the Coca-Cola 600, and finished 24th. He moved up to a new Cup team for a new team for Haas, the No. 70, in 2007. Driving with sponsorships from Yellow, Best Buy, Haas Automation, and Radioactive Energy Drink, Sauter had two Top 10s but finished 30th in points. He competed in six Busch races that year with Jay Robinson Racing, but could not finish higher than 23rd.\n\nSauter was dropped from the No. 70 after the season, and rejoined Phoenix Racing for the 2008 season, where he was released after five races. He has since spent time as a substitute driver for many teams, starting at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where he was unable to qualify the No. 21 McKee Foods-sponsored Ford. He soon returned to Haas to drive several races in their No. 70, with a best finish of 20th, as well as attempting several races for John Carter. After one-off starts for Fitz Motorsports and Bob Schact in the Nationwide Series, he drove for Curb Agajanian Performance Group and Derrike Cope Racing, but did not complete a race for either team. He also drove one Truck race at Martinsville for SS-Green Light Racing. Sauter returned to the trucks in 2009, replacing Shelby Howard in the No. 13 FunSand-sponsored truck for ThorSport Racing in association with Cary Agajanian. Sauter won his first ever Truck Series race at the Las Vegas, holding off teammate Matt Crafton for the win. Sauter beat Tayler Malsam in the NASCAR Rookie of the Year standings. For 2010, Sauter attempted the No. 35 Chevy for Tommy Baldwin Racing for 3 races and took over the No. 36 ride after Phoenix with little success. He also drove some late-season races for Prism Motorsports in the No. 66 Toyota. He picked up his second career truck win in 2010 at Kansas after a late race collision and save with Ron Hornaday Jr.\n\nSauter grabbed his 3rd career victory at Martinsville in 2011, battling Kyle Busch on the last lap. Despite winning the season-finale at the Ford 200, he lost the championship to Austin Dillon by 6 points.\n\nHe would win the 2012 WinStar World Casino 400K with a ThorSport Racing 1–2 finish alongside Matt Crafton.\n\nIn 2013, Sauter started the season with his first win at Daytona International Speedway in the NextEra Energy Resources 250. It was also Toyota's 100th Camping World Truck Series win. On April 6, Sauter won the Kroger 250 at Martinsville Speedway. It was only the second time in Truck Series history that someone has won back-to-back season opening wins since Mark Martin did it in 2006.\n\nWhile competing full-time in the Truck Series, Sauter raced several times in his home state of Wisconsin in 2015. He appeared at the Slinger Nationals at Slinger Super Speedway, won an ARCA Midwest Tour race at Madison International Speedway, the Larry Detjens Memorial Race at State Park Speedway, and set a new Super Late Model track record at an ARCA Midwest Tour race at Wisconsin International Raceway.\nOn October 15, 2015, Sauter announced that he would be joining GMS Racing for 2016. Sauter won in his debut with GMS at Daytona. In the Chase, Sauter won at Martinsville and Texas to advance to the championship 4. Sauter went on to win the championship at Homestead, finishing 3rd in the race. Sauter had a successful 2017 season, winning Dover in early June and had a couple stage wins and had been consistent all year long. He won his second race of the year at Chicagoland in September. Sauter won Texas and Phoenix, which advanced him to the final round at Homestead Miami. He finished 3rd in the race but Christopher Bell, who finished runner-up, took the championship and Johnny Sauter finished 2nd in the standings by just one point. Sauter opened up 2018 by winning the Daytona race for the third time in his career. He would subsequently win at Dover, Charlotte, Texas, Bristol, and Martinsville and finish 4th in points.\n\nIn May 2018, Sauter returned to the Nationwide (now Xfinity) Series at Dover; he drove the No. 23 GMS car in place of the suspended Spencer Gallagher. He ran the race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway as well in the summer, finishing 19th.\n\nOn January 9, 2019, GMS announced the team had parted ways with Sauter. He later rejoined ThorSport to drive the No. 13. Sauter won his first race of the season at Dover in May. At Iowa, Sauter was parked by NASCAR for wrecking Austin Hill under caution on lap 139 of 200. As a result of the incident, he was suspended for the following week's race at Gateway. Myatt Snider was announced to substitute for Sauter at Gateway. Sauter was eliminated from the playoffs at Las Vegas when he finished 29th after experiencing an engine failure that also plagued three other trucks. Ilmor, the manufacturer of the engines, took responsibility for the NT1 engines that suffered from severe detonation due to the combination of the high engine load condition combined with the extreme weather conditions in Las Vegas. Despite Ilmor's announcement, NASCAR denied ThorSport's request to reinstate Sauter and Grant Enfinger into the playoffs. At Talladega, Sauter appeared to have won the race, but was penalized and placed in 14th for blocking Riley Herbst below the yellow line on the final lap, effectively giving the win to Spencer Boyd.\n\nSauter enjoys flying, fishing, and playing the banjo in his free time. He is of the Catholic faith. \n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}
{"id": "2147375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147375", "title": "Parthenon Frieze", "text": "Parthenon Frieze\n\nThe Parthenon frieze is the high-relief pentelic marble sculpture created to adorn the upper part of the Parthenon’s naos. It was sculpted between c. 443 and 437 BC, most likely under the direction of Pheidias. Of the 160 meters (524 ft) of the original frieze, 128 meters (420 ft) survives—some 80 percent. The rest is known only from the drawings attributed to French artist Jacques Carrey in 1674, thirteen years before the Venetian bombardment that ruined the temple.\n\nAt present, the majority of the frieze is at the British Museum in London (forming the major part of the Elgin Marbles); the largest proportion of the rest is at the Acropolis Museum in Athens, and the remainder of fragments shared between six other institutions. Casts of the frieze may be found in the Beazley archive at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, at the Spurlock Museum in Urbana, in the Skulpturhalle at Basel and elsewhere.\n\nPlutarch’s \"Life of Pericles\", 13.4–9, informs us “the man who directed all the projects and was overseer [episkopos] for him [Pericles] was Phidias... Almost everything was under his supervision, and, as we have said, he was in charge, owing to his friendship with Perikles, of all the other artists”. The description was not \"architekton\", the term usually given to the creative influence behind a building project, rather \"episkopos\". But it is from this claim, the circumstantial evidence of Phidias’s known work on the Athena Parthenos and his central role in the Periclean building programme that he is attributed authorship of the frieze. The frieze consists of 378 figures and 245 animals. It was 160 meters (524 ft) in length when complete, as well as 1 meter in height, and it projects 5.6 cm forward at its maximum depth. It is composed of 114 blocks of an average 1.22 meters in length, depicting two parallel files in procession. It was a particular novelty of the Parthenon that the cella carries an Ionic frieze over the hexastyle pronaos rather than Doric metopes, as would have been expected of a Doric temple. Judging by the existence of regulae and guttae below the frieze on the east wall this was an innovation introduced late in the building process and replaced the ten metopes and triglyphs that might otherwise have been placed there.\n\nThe marble was quarried from Mount Pentelicus and transported 19 km to the acropolis of Athens. A persistent question has been whether it was carved \"in situ\". Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17 mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds it is easier to move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a crowbar to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges. No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style. However, American archeologist Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given. It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion. Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as Poseidon’s trident and the laurel in Apollo’s hand. The many drill holes found in Hera’s and Apollo's heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.\n\nThe system of numbering the frieze blocks dates back to Adolf Michaelis's 1871 work \"Der Parthenon\", and since then Ian Jenkins has revised this scheme in the light of recent discoveries. The convention, here preserved, is that blocks are numbered in Roman and figures in Arabic numerals, the figures are numbered left to right against the direction of the procession on the north and west and with it on the south.\n\nThe narrative of the frieze begins at the southwest corner where the procession appears to divide into two separate files. The first third of the west frieze is not part of the procession, but instead, seems to be the preparatory stages for the participants. The first figure here is a marshal dressing, W30, followed by several men preparing the horses W28–23 until figure W22 who, it has been suggested, may be engaged in the \"dokimasia\", the tryout or enrollment of the knights. W24 is an ambiguous figure who might be either the protesting owner of a rejected horse or a \"keryx\" (herald) whose hand held part of an otherwise lost \"salpinx\" (trumpet), but either way this point marks the beginning of the procession proper.\n\nThe following ranks W21–1 along with N75–136 and S1–61 are all of horsemen and constitute 46% of the whole frieze. They are divided into two lines of ten ranks – the same number as that of the Attic tribes. All figures are beardless youths with the exception of two, W8 and W15, who along with S2–7 wear Thracian dress of fur cap, a patterned cloak, and high boots; these have been identified by Martin Robertson as \"hipparchs\". Next are the four-horse chariots, each with charioteer and armed passenger, there are ten on the south frieze and eleven on the north. Since these passengers are sometimes depicted as dismounting they may be taken to represent the \"apobatai\", participants in the ceremonial race found in Attica and Boeotia.\n\nBy N42 and S89 the equestrian parade is at an end, and the following 16 figures on the north and 18 on the south are taken to be the elders of Athens judging by their braided hair, an attribute of distinguished age in Classical art. Four of these figures raise their right hand in a clenched fist gesture suggestive of a pose associated with the \"thallophoroi\" (olive branch bearers) who were older men chosen in competition for their good looks alone. No drill holes, however, exist for any branch to be inserted in their hands. Next in line (S107–114, N20–28) are the musicians: four kithara (a variant of the lyre) and four aulos (flute) players. N16–19 and S115–118 (conjectured) perhaps, as \"hydriaphoroi\", the water-vessel carriers, here men, rather than metic girls mentioned in the literature on the Panathenaia. N13–15, S119–121 are the \"skaphephoroi\", the tray bearers of the honeycombs and cakes used to entice the sacrificial animals to the altar. N1–12, S122–149 are the four cows and four sheep on the north and ten cows on the south meant for sacrifice on the acropolis, presumably an abbreviated form of the hecatomb usually offered on this occasion – there is an a-b-a rhythm of placid and restive cows.\n\nAs the files converge on the east frieze we encounter the first women celebrants E2–27, E50–51, E53–63. The priestesses carry the sacrificial instruments and paraphernalia including the \"phiale\" (phial or jug), \"oinochoai\" (wine jars), \"thymiaterion\" (incense burner), and in the case of E50–51, evidently they have just handed the marshal E49 a \"kanoun\", making the girl the kanephoros. The next groups E18–23, E43–46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if one does not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or \"athlothetai\" officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.\n\nInterpretations of the figures varies. The twelve seated deities are taken to be the Olympians, they are one third taller than any other figure on the frieze and are arranged in two groups of six on \"diphroi\" (backless) stools, common forms of ancient furniture, with the exception of Zeus who is enthroned. Their backs are turned to what must be the culminating event of the procession E31–35; five figures (three children and two adults, and although badly corroded, the two children on the left appear to be girls bearing objects on their heads, while a third, perhaps a boy, assisting an adult who may be the \"archon basileus\", in folding a piece of cloth. This frieze often is interpreted as the presentation of Athena’s peplos, perhaps by the arrhephoroi, but debate exists regarding who the figures represent more than what ritual is represented.\n\nThe Parthenon frieze is the defining monument of the High Classical style of Attic sculpture. It stands between the gradual eclipse of the Severe style, as witnessed on the Parthenon metopes, and the evolution of the Late Classical Rich style, exemplified by the Nike balustrade. What sources the designer of the frieze drew upon is difficult to gauge, certainly large scale narrative art was familiar to 5th-century Athenians as in the Stoa poikile painting by Polygnotos of Thasos. While there is an overall coherence to the work there are design differences on opposing sides of the frieze that has suggested to some scholars the possibility of more than one designer and a pattern of influence amongst them. There is greater nudity and frontally on the north than the south, the massing and distribution of figures is greatly different on the east than the more widely spaced west, and the east and north generally exhibit greater innovation. This evidence, along with the frequency with which Greek artists are thought to have collaborated, has led Jenifer Neils to hypothesize the existence of two designers working on the sculpture. This would admit the possibility of a later designer comparing and competing with the earlier, and so, explain the observable changes in composition. Geographical orientations also may have dictated what would be represented on one side versus another, i.e., Amazons to the west, and so forth.\n\nThis artistic period is one of discovery of the expressive possibilities of the human body; there is a greater freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the \"Doryphoros\" of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body as if it were a curtain obscuring the form below, in these sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.\n\nAs no description of the frieze survives from antiquity and many religious rituals involved secret symbolism and traditions left unspoken, so the question of the meaning of the sculpture has been a persistent and unresolved one. The first published attempt at interpretation belongs to Cyriacus of Ancona in the 15th century, who referred to it as the “victories of Athens in the time of Pericles”. What is now the more accepted view of the piece, however, namely that it depicts the Greater Panathenaic procession from the Leokoreion by the Dipylon Gate, to the Acropolis, was mooted by Stuart and Revett in the second volume of their \"Antiquities of Athens\", 1787. Subsequent interpretations have built largely on this theory, even if they disallow that a temple sculpture could represent a contemporary event rather than a mythological or historical one. It has only been in recent years that an alternative thesis in which the frieze depicts the founding myth of the city of Athens instead of the festival \"pompe\" has emerged.\n\nThe contention that the scene depicts the festival for Athena is fraught with problems. Later sources indicate that a number of classes of individual who performed a role in the procession are not present in the frieze, these include: the hoplites, the allies in the Delian League, the \"skiaphoroi\" or umbrella bearers, the female \"hydraiphoroi\" (only male hydrai bearers are portrayed), the \"thetes\", slaves, metics, the Panathenaic ship, and some would suggest the \"kanephoros\", although there is evidence that she is accounted for. That what we now see was meant to be a generic image of the religious festival is problematic since no other temple sculpture depicts a contemporary event involving mortals. Locating the scene in mythical or historical time has been the principal difficulty of the line of inquiry. John Boardman has suggested that the cavalry portray the heroization of the \"Marathonomachoi\", the hoplites who fell at Marathon in 490, and that, therefore these riders were the Athenians who took part in the last pre-war Greater Panathenaia. In support, he points out the number of horsemen, chariot passengers (but not charioteers), grooms, and marshals comes to the same as the number Herodotos gives for the Athenian dead: 192. Equally suggestive of a reference to the Persian Wars is the similarity several scholars have noted of the frieze to the Apadana sculpture in Persepolis. This has variously been posited to be democratic Athens counter-posing itself to oriental tyranny, or, aristocratic Athens emulating the Imperial East. Further to this zeitgeist argument there is J.J. Politt’s contention that the frieze embodies a Periclean manifesto, which favours the cultural institutions of \"agones\" (or contests, as witnessed by the \"apobatai\"), sacrifices, and military training as well as a number of other democratic virtues. More recent scholarship pursuing this vein has made the frieze a site of ideological tension between the elite and the \"demos\" with perhaps, only the aristocracy present, and merely veiled reference to the ten tribes.\n\nThe pediments, metopes, and shield of the Parthenos all illustrate the mythological past and as the deities are observing on the east frieze, it is natural to reach for a mythological explanation. Chrysoula Kardara, has ventured that the relief shows us the first Panathenaic procession instituted under the mythical King Kekrops. This explanation would account for the absence of the allies and the ship, as these post-date the original practice of the sacrificial rite. In evidence she offers E35 as the future King Erichthonios presenting the first \"peplos\" to his predecessor Kekrops, iconographically similar to the boy’s depiction on a fragmentary kylix of the 450s. A recent interpretation by Joan Breton Connelly identifies the central scene on the east frieze (hence above the door to the cella and focal point of the procession) not as the handing over of Athena’s peplos by the \"arrhephoroi\", but the donning of sacrificial garb by the daughter of King Erechtheus in preparation for the sacrifice of her life. An interpretation suggested by the text of the fragmentary papyrus remains of Euripides’s Erichtheus, wherein her life is demanded in order to save the city from Eumolpos and the Eleusinians. Thus, the deities turn their backs to prevent pollution from the sight of her death. A contentious subject in the field, Connelly's solution to the problem of meaning poses as many problems as it answers.\n\nThe earliest surviving works of art that exhibit traces of the influence of the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the frieze. While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer to the end of the century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of \"eusebeia\", or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.\n\nThe impact of the frieze may be sought in the Attic relief sculpture of the late fifth century; this resonance also may be discovered to some degree in the public works of the Hephaisteion frieze and the Nike Athena balustrade, where the imagery of the seated deities and the sandal-binder respectively, likely owes a debt to the Parthenon. There also are traces found on the private commissions of grave stelae from the period, for example, the “cat stele” from Aegina bears a distinct similarity to figures N135–6. As does the Hermes of the four-figure relief known from a Roman copy. Later classicizing art of the Hellenistic and Roman eras also looked to the frieze for inspiration as attested by the Lycian Sarcophagus of Sidon, Phoenicia, the Ara Pacis Augustae, the Gemma Augustea, and many pieces of the Hadrianic generation.\n\n\n"}

Three verses of the Quran were written about a situation that concerned him.\n\nAbu Fukayha was ancestrally from the Azd tribe in Yemen. He was a slave in Mecca in the possession of Safwan ibn Umayya ibn Muharrith of the Kinana tribe. His master manumitted him at an unknown date; but his social status in the city remained \"insignificant\".\n\nHe had one son, Abu Tajra, and two daughters, Fukayha and Baraka. \nBaraka and Fukayha were among the Muslims who migrated to Abyssinia, together with Safwan ibn Umayya's daughter Fatima. \n\nThe aged Abu Fukayha became a Muslim. He suffered under the persecution of 614-616, when he was tortured until he did not know what he was saying. Muhammad said that a Muslim who denied his faith under such circumstances, yet \"whose heart remains at rest in its faith,\" was not to blame.\n\nAbu Fukayha and other poor men used to sit in the Kaaba with Muhammad. The Quraysh used to jeer at Muhammad for consorting with humble people, saying: \"These are his companions, as you see. Is it such creatures that God has chosen from among us to give guidance and truth? If what Muhammad has brought were a good thing these fellows would not have been the first to get it, and God would not have put them before us.\" Muhammad produced this prophecy in response.\nAbu Fukayha is not mentioned among those who emigrated to Medina in 622. It is likely that he had died of natural causes by this date.\n\nIt is popularly believed that Abu Fukayha was bought and manumitted by Abu Bakr. This is not correct. His name does not appear on Ibn Ishaq's list of slaves bought by Abu Bakr, which professes to be complete. Rather, Ibn Ishaq expressly states that it was Abu Fukayha's original master, Safwan, who freed him.\n"}
{"id": "2147405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147405", "title": "Ron Fellows", "text": "Ron Fellows\n\nRonald Charles Fellows CM (born September 28, 1959 in Windsor, Ontario) is an accomplished Canadian SCCA Trans-Am, IMSA, and American Le Mans Series driver. Fellows holds the record for most wins by a foreign-born driver in NASCAR's top three series (Sprint Cup, Nationwide, and Trucks) with six – four in Nationwide and two in Trucks. He also holds the Member of the Order of Canada.\n\nFellows was born in Windsor, Ontario on September 28, 1959. At age 4 he became interested in auto racing with his family. He found a love for French-Canadian Formula 1 driver Gilles Villeneuve. Fellows has one of the biggest collections of Gilles Villeneuve merchandise in Canada and called Villeneuve his idol. To attend F1 races at a young age, Fellows went to watch them at a local track on an island in Montreal Canada; a track that eventually would be named Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. When Villeneuve died in 1982 the track was named after Villeneuve himself. Fellows developed a dream to win at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve when he became a racing driver. He accomplished his goal in 2008, winning the NASCAR Nationwide Series race at the track the NAPA Auto Parts 200.\n\nBesides his racing career, Fellows owns a corporate business chain the Ron Fellows Performance Driving Schools and is one of the owners of car brand, Corvette as well as Corvette's racing operations. He also owns a charity called the Sunoco-Ron Fellows Karting Championship to help young kids become race-car drivers. In January 2013, Ron Fellows purchased the Canadian Tire Motorsports Park racetrack and NASCAR hosted a truck series race there-the first time since 2000 that the truck series came to a road course. Fellows' current goal for his track is to bring the Cup series to the track someday.\n\nHe has a wife Lynda Fellows, and 3 kids, Lyndsay, Sam and Patrick Fellows. Ron is a close friend of Dale Earnhardt Jr. who he currently drives for in the NASCAR Nationwide Series; as well as Gilles Villeneuve's son Jacques who was a student in a racing school with Ron.\n\nHe began his career in Karts, which led to Formula Ford 1600 and Formula Ford 2000. When funds for these projects ran low, he left racing for a 9-year stint as gas pipeline worker. Fellows returned to the track in the 1980s with help from driving school instructor Richard Spenard. He made his professional debut in 1986 in the Player's GM Challenge, driving a showroom stock Chevrolet Camaro.\n\nHe had a dominant 1989 season, capturing both the title at Mosport Park and his first SCCA Trans-Am Series race during the same weekend. His career skyrocketed as he became one of the most successful drivers in the history of Trans Am, with 19 wins in 95 starts.\n\nFellows then had 2 starts in the legendary Ferrari 333SP, including a 1997 win at Mosport Park in the IMSA GT Championship.\n\nIn 1998, Fellows began his long association with GM's Corvette Racing program, with the historic Chevrolet Corvette C5.R. He was also briefly involved with the development of the Cadillac LMP program. At the 2000 Rolex 24 at Daytona, he made history by setting the closest margin of victory in the history of the event, 31 seconds behind the winning Dodge Viper GTS-R of Olivier Beretta, Dominique Dupuy and Karl Wendlinger. Fellows and Corvette Racing fared better the next year, winning overall with Chris Kneifel, Johnny O'Connell, and Franck Fréon. Later that year in June, Corvette Racing achieved its ultimate goal, a GTS class win in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Scott Pruett and Johnny O'Connell. Corvette Racing also captured the American Le Mans Series GTS title that same year.\n\nIn 2002, the Corvette C5.R once again dominated the American Le Mans Series season, with a GTS class win at the 12 Hours of Sebring, along with a repeat of their 24 Hours of Le Mans GTS class victory. For the 2003 season, Corvette Racing won the American Le Mans Series GTS title with a very close down to the wire fight with the Prodrive Ferrari 550 team. In 2004 Corvette Racing continued to dominate the American Le Mans Series GTS class, including another GTS class win at the 12 Hours of Sebring. Fellows also competed in one NASCAR Cup Series race at Watkins Glen, where he started 43rd and climbed his way up to 2nd place.\n\nIn 2005, Corvette Racing debuted the revolutionary Chevrolet Corvette C6.R at the 12 Hours of Sebring, with high expectations. A tire blow out erased their chances of capturing the GT1 (was GTS) win, with the Prodrive Aston Martin DBR9 taking the class win. However, later that year, the tides would turn as Corvette Racing won their 3rd 24 Hours of Le Mans class title in 6 years, beating the Aston Martin DBR9's with superior reliability and strategy. Although Fellows was not driving the winning Chevrolet Corvette C6.R, he ran a respectable race in the No. 63 car.\n\nIn 2006, Fellows returned for a full season with Corvette Racing. However, a dark cloud loomed over the 2006 season as a result of the controversy surrounding IMSA's performance balancing. Corvette Racing's opposition during 2006 was the Prodrive Aston Martin team, which ran two full-season cars on Pirelli tires. The Pirelli tires were their Achilles heel, as they were not as competitive as the Michelin tires on the Corvette. Prodrive expressed their disdain for their disadvantage, and IMSA, the ALMS sanctioning body, introduced a number of penalties for the Corvette Racing team, to 'balance' the performance. Despite this controversy, Fellows remained optimistic and still carried himself with the professionalism and class for which he is known. Despite the penalties, Corvette Racing prevailed, winning their fifth ALMS championship. Corvette Racing also went on to win their fourth 24 Hours of Le Mans in six years. However, Fellows did not have the best luck in 2006, with the title going to the sister car driven by Jan Magnussen, Olivier Beretta and Oliver Gavin.\n\nFellows returned to Corvette Racing in a limited supporting role in the American Le Mans Series. He was the third driver for the three long-distance races, and competed at Mosport, his home race. He sat out the other races, providing technical input and experienced advice to the team from behind the wall.\n\nFellows has had various stints in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, Nationwide Series, and Sprint Cup Series, as a \"road course ringer\". He has 2 wins and 3 poles in the Camping World Truck Series, winning twice at Watkins Glen. He has had even greater success in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, where he has 4 wins and two poles in 6 starts. He was also the first non-American to win a NASCAR Nationwide Series event. As of November 22, 2011, Fellows holds the record for most wins by a foreign-born driver in NASCAR's top three series (Sprint Cup, Nationwide, and Trucks) with six - four in Nationwide and two in Trucks.\n\nFellows made his NASCAR Cup Series debut in 1995 driving the No. 68 Chevy for Canaska Motorsports, owned by Victor Sifton. After he performed awfully during the race, Fellows stepped down from Cup racing to drive a part-time stint in the Craftsman Truck Series. Fellows did not return to the Cup series until 1998, driving the No. 96 Caterpillar Chevy for American Equipment Racing and Buzz McCall. Starting second alongside Jeff Gordon, Ron Fellows had a promising start in the race, until he broke down from axle issues on lap 12, due to an oversight by a pit crew member, causing him to enter the garages for repairs and finish 42nd. He also ran an oval race in the same car-at Loudon which happens to be his single race he's run that is not a road course. He finished 36th after starting dead last.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, Ron Fellows was a regular winner at Watkins Glen in the Truck Series, winning in 1997 and 1999. His first truck win in 1997 was for Billy Hess' #48 AER Manufacturing team and his last truck win in 1999 was for NEMCO Motorsports. A year after winning his first truck race, Ron Fellows won his first Busch series event on June 28, 1998, leading the most laps during the 1998 Lysol 200. After polesitter Boris Said spun on lap 1, Fellows took the lead and led 54 of 82 laps. Fellows held off Michael McLaughlin to win the race. In 1999, Fellows nearly repeated the win but got passed by hotshot Dale Earnhardt Jr. on the final lap.\n\nIn August of 1999, Ron Fellows had his career-best finish at Watkins Glen driving the No. 87 Chevy for Joe Nemechek. In his only scheduled NASCAR Cup series race for 1999 for the Frontier at the Glen, Ron Fellows led 3 laps, but was beaten by Jeff Gordon on the final restart. Ron Fellows returned to the No. 87 in 2001 driving both road courses. A promising run at Sears Point Raceway, in which he led the most laps, Fellows finished 38th after crashing with 14 laps to go. He later led 3 laps at Watkins Glen during the 2001 Global Crossing at the Glen but finished 42nd after breaking his axles on lap 30 of 90. His only start in 2002 was at Sears Point Raceway, in which he finished 25th in his last race for Joe Nemechek.\n\nIn 2000, Fellows was in talk with Dale Earnhardt about driving for Dale Earnhardt Inc. full-time after 2001. When it appeared that the full-time deal was sealed up, Earnhardt was killed during the 2001 Daytona 500 which left the deal invalid. In 2003 however, Fellows was remembered by Ty Norris, the DEI co-owner, and he was hired for the road races to drive the No. 1 car.\n\nIn 2003 at Infineon, during the Dodge/Save Mart 350, Fellows had his career's nearest-miss. Fellows started third, and took advantage of a battle between Richard Childress Racing teammates Robby Gordon and Kevin Harvick to take the lead. Fellows led a lot of laps, and controlled the race with less than 70 laps to go. However Fellows had his sure-win end for good after being called into pit road just after an untimely caution came out with 38 laps to go. Restarting 31st, Fellows finished 7th. Though Fellows has finished second twice at the Glen, Fellows stated in 2006 and 2013 that the 2003 Dodge Save-Mart 350 was how closest he had been to winning because he was dominant at Sonoma while the Watkins Glen finishes, is when he lacked the proper speed.\n\nIn 2004, Fellows had one of his greatest performances. Because qualifying was cancelled due to rain, the lineup for the Watkins Glen event was decided by owner-points. Fellows started 43rd and finished second behind winner Tony Stewart. Fellows did challenge Stewart on the final restart but all of his speed was worn out by his charge through the field. The following season, Ron contested the 2005 Telcel Motorola 200 in Mexico City, for the inaugural Busch Series race there, driving the #87 NEMCO Motorsports Chevy. He ended up finishing 41st after blowing an engine early on.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, Fellows drove the No. 32 car for Cal Wells and PPI Motorsports at Infineon and Watkins Glen. After starting 43rd at Sonoma he finished 8th. In 2006, Fellows had originally finished 10th during the AMD at the Glen, but was penalized 30 seconds hours after the race ended, for having illegally made passes through the \"bus stop\". The Tide team later closed up shop after the year was over, throwing Fellows out of his part-time ride.\n\nIn 2007, Fellows joined Hall of Fame Racing as driver for the road races. In a similar performance to the 2003 Infineon race, Fellows led a bit of the race after passing in a 3-wide move, and lost the lead after having to pit during a caution. Fellows finished 15th. After starting 26th at Watkins Glen, Fellows moved up to fourth. Fellows probably would have had a shot at the win had he not gotten a speeding on pit road penalty on lap 55 and had to restart 40th. But in a challenging rough drive through the field, Fellows finished 4th.\n\nDuring 2006 and 2007, Fellows drove the No. 33 Busch series car for Kevin Harvick Incorporated, driving the road course races in Mexico City, Montreal, and Watkins Glen. In 2006, Fellows led 1 lap in Mexico City, but finished 33rd after blowing a radiator with less than 10 laps to go. Fellows picked up a top ten at Watkins Glen, finishing 9th.\n\nIn 2007, Fellows renewed his deal for one more year to drive for Kevin Harvick Inc. in the No. 33 for the NBS road course events. In Mexico, Fellows didn't have a promising race, finishing 33rd after blowing an engine with less than 15 laps to go.\n\nAt the first NBS race at Montreal, he drove a good race, starting 3rd in the No. 33 Camping World.com car. After spinning out with less than 9 laps to go, Fellows mounted his best drive of the race during the final green-white-checkered finish attempt; he drove from 14th place to 4th place in two laps. His boss Kevin Harvick ended up winning the race because of Robby Gordon and rookie Marcos Ambrose's altercation. The next week, at Watkins Glen, he controlled the race early, leading 11 laps, but ended up 24th after tangling with fellow road ringer Scott Pruett on the final lap.\n\nIn 2008, Fellows only raced in 1 event, driving his first race for JR Motorsports. Fellows, in his only start of 2008, won a rain-shortened NAPA Auto Parts 200 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in the No. 5 car at Montreal. He won after Marcos Ambrose was black-flagged for slipping across the soaked pit road too fast just before the red flag flew. This race made history as the first points paying race to be run on Goodyear rain tires. NASCAR races are generally red flagged for rain. This victory marked Ron's fourth NASCAR Nationwide series win, all coming on road courses. This also tied him for first in the Nationwide Series for most road course wins. He is tied with Terry Labonte with 4. Fellows was very emotional about his win because his lifelong childhood dream was to win a professional car race at Montreal since his childhood hero Gilles Villeneuve raced at the track when he watched from the stadium. As a result of his big win Fellows was given the No. 5 JR Motorsports crew for a multi-year deal. He drove for JR Motorsports through 2009 and 2010 for the road course races. Fellows didn't have any promising races in 2009, but came back to the No. 88 team in 2010 to finish second at Road America. \n\nFellows returned to JR Motorsports in 2011 for the road course races, driving the #7 AER car. He was in contention to win the Bucyrus 200 at Road America. He took the lead from Justin Allgaier, who had run out of fuel previously, passing Reed Sorenson in the process. However, NASCAR ruled that Fellows had passed both drivers under the caution flag way too fast. Believing that Sorenson slowed due to also being out of fuel, Fellows drove past them at nearly race speed until he was leading the caution to the pace lap, though NASCAR rules stipulate that a driver must maintain reasonable speed while under the caution flag (Speeding is not reasonable caution speed anymore). As a result, Fellows was relegated to second place post-race, handing the win to Sorenson. Fellows said post-race that he should have won, although a year later, he admitted in a pre-race interview that NASCAR made the right call.\n\nDuring 2010 and 2011, Fellows drove the No. 36 car for Tommy Baldwin Racing in the Cup series, but only at Watkins Glen. After running most of the 2010 Heluva Good at the Glen in the top twenty, Fellows suffered a blown engine and finished 40th. In 2011, Fellows only ran at Watkins Glen, driving the No. 36 Golden Corral car for Baldwin. Fellows wasn't much of a factor in the race. While running 25th on the final lap, Fellows got tangled in a final-lap crash involving David Ragan, and David Reutimann, crashing head-on into a barrier in the esses. He finished 30th.\n\nThe next year, Fellows couldn't land a ride for the Sprint Cup series but ran the Nationwide Series road course races for JR Motorsports. Fellows led 4 laps at Road America and finished 3rd. He finished 5th at Watkins Glen and 5th in Montreal. In 2013, Fellows ran his last race with JRM at the inaugural race in Mid-Ohio before parting ways with the team at year's end.\n\nFellows returned to the Cup series in 2013. He drove the No. 33 car for Circle Sport Racing. His best finish was at Infineon Raceway, when he finished 22nd.\n\nGM has created Ron Fellows edition Corvette Z06 in 2007, with a signature trim package. It features unique white paint and Grand Sport hash marks on the front left fender.\n\nHe also supports many charities and programs and, like many Canadians, he has a deep passion for hockey, especially the Toronto Maple Leafs. Ron lives outside of Toronto with his wife and three children, though he has a second home in a town near Las Vegas because his driving school is based there.\n\nOn June 1, 2011, it was announced that Fellows, along with partners Carlo Fidani and Allan Boughton had formed Canadian Motorsport Ventures Ltd., which had just completed the purchase of Mosport International Raceway, north of Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada.\n\nOn December 31st, 2019, as part of the New Year Honours, Fellows was awarded the Member of the Order of Canada, for \"outstanding work in multi-disciplinary roles in motor-racing.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2147409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147409", "title": "Arthur A. Collins", "text": "Arthur A. Collins\n\nArthur Andrews Collins (September 9, 1909 – February 25, 1987) was a radio engineer and entrepreneur. He first gained national recognition as a teenager for significant advances in radio communication. He later founded his own radio engineering and manufacturing company in 1933, Collins Radio Co.. Rapidly expanding during World War II, Collins Radio eventually grew into a Fortune 500 leader in avionics, telecommunication, and military, space and commercial radio communications. Collins and his company ultimately became pioneers in melding computer and communication technology. Widely considered a genius in electronics innovation, he shunned personal publicity and is relatively little known today, even within the electronics community.\n\nArthur A. Collins was born in Kingfisher, Oklahoma to Merle H. Collins (a mortgage banker) and Faith Andrews Collins (a graduate of Rockford College in Illinois). The family moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa when Arthur was 7. Merle founded Collins Farms Company in 1925, which combined inefficient small farms into one collective enterprise, using the best available equipment and modern practices (contour plowing and erosion control, crop rotation, newly available hybrid seed corn) to achieve greatly increased productivity. This novel approach was initially successful but faltered as the Great Depression hit. His son Arthur was intensely interested in radio, became a licensed amateur radio operator at age 14, and designed and built his own equipment, purchasing expensive vacuum tubes with his father's help. Arthur Collins became expert in circuit design and wave propagation, publishing several articles in specialty journals.\n\nCollins became friends with fellow amateur radio \"hams\", including John Reinartz, who shared a special interest in radio wave propagation. Within the radio spectrum only longer waves were thought to be refracted by the atmosphere (\"skip\"), allowing long distance communication at night, but not so the shorter wavelength relegated to amateurs. Reinartz and Collins discovered that such \"skip\" did occur in the 20 meter range and during daytime, which allowed long distance communication with this type of equipment. When Reinartz became the ship's radio operator on the National Geographic-sponsored MacMillan Arctic expedition in 1925 only he and Collins were able to maintain reliable communication, unlike the U.S. Navy using longer wavelengths. Collins gained national recognition.\n\nA young Arthur Collins' attic ham station; his radio communication was a critical link to the outside world for the 1925 MacMillan Expedition to the subarctic.\n\nArthur Collins graduated from high school in Cedar Rapids and attended college at Amherst in Massachusetts, but returned at the end of his freshman year. He never obtained a degree, but rather took courses at the University of Iowa and at Coe College in Cedar Rapids. His own studies, and research done during the early years of his own company, typically outpaced advances in electronics coursework in academia. Yet he valued higher education, promoting programs for his employees to further their education, and even establishing courses with in-house instructors at Collins Radio.\n\nIn 1930 Arthur Collins married Margaret (Peg) Van Dyke in Cedar Rapids, a noted artist within her community and a former student of Grant Wood. They had two children, Susan, born in 1939, and Michael, born in 1943. Margaret died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1955. Arthur remarried in 1957, to Mary Margaret Meis, assistant director of dietetics at Mercy Hospital. They had two sons, Alan, born 1963, and David, born 1966.\n\nArthur Collins maintained two residences, one in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and another in Dallas, Texas, where he lived following the sale of Collins Radio to Rockwell International. Collins also kept his boat, a 70-foot custom-built fiberglass yacht, The Peregrine, in Newport Beach, California. This was his office and home during visits to the Newport Beach facility, and featured a large central \"conference room\".\n\nCollins founded Collins Radio Co. in 1933, building high quality amateur and commercial transmitters (not receivers for the domestic market). With recognition from success with the MacMillan expedition, Collins equipment was selected for the Byrd Expedition to the Antarctic (1933-1934). Beginning manufacturing in his basement, Arthur Collins soon rented building space and eventually constructed the first Collins Radio factory in Cedar Rapids in 1940. At this time the company had sales of about $500,000 and 150 employees. Collins Radio was recognized for excellence in design and manufacture of amateur and commercial transmitters and receivers, and began building aircraft radios in 1935.\n\nThe heart of a radio transmitter, the oscillator, at that time used a vacuum tube to generate a radio frequency. RCA claimed it had exclusive rights to the de Forest vacuum tube oscillator circuit patent, and brought suit against Collins Radio and other purported infringers. In addition to rockets, Robert Goddard was also an electronics innovator, and when Arthur Collins discovered that Goddard's 1915 oscillator patent predated the de Forest patent Collins met with Goddard to explain that RCA's tube monopoly was a serious impediment to competitive innovation in electronics. With Goddard's help the practicality of the Goddard design was demonstrated in court and the suit was dropped in 1938, allowing Collins and others to freely develop new technology. Goddard and Collins remained friends until Goddard's death in 1945.\n\nDuring World War II Collins Radio became a key supplier of ground, ship, and aircraft communication equipment, expanding from about 350 to a peak of about 3700 employees. Arthur Collins was a co-designer of the Autotune device. Invented for commercial aviation shortly before the war, it allowed the pilot to remotely switch to preset frequencies. Autotune precisely adjusted the radio in about 40 seconds, without the lengthy hand-tuning normally required by a designated radio operator. The ART-13 100 watt HF military radio was highly prized for this feature and for its rugged and reliable construction. Over 90,000 were built for B-24, B-25, B-29, TBF and other aircraft. Collins gear was also extensively used for tactical ground communication and aboard ships. Following the Pearl Harbor attack the Corregidor station in the Philippines used Collins equipment to reach the outside world, as did the USS Missouri during the surrender ceremonies in Tokyo Bay.\n\nAdvances in aviation during World War II led to the rapid post-war expansion of commercial and private aviation. Collins Radio quickly shifted from war-time projects to building communication equipment for the airlines and corporate fleets. A licensed pilot in his 20s, Arthur Collins led the pioneering development of the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) and other integrated flight instruments that combined in one display the pitch, roll, and yaw attitudes of the aircraft as well as its compass heading. Collins Radio became a world leader in avionics during the 1950s and 1960s. The 618T HF transceiver was a mainstay for the airlines and the ARC-27, with automatic tuning and 1750 channels, was the first practical UHF military transceiver, in service for over two decades.\n\nArthur Collins expanded his operations to Dallas and Burbank, California in the 1950s. In California he formed a research group under the direction of Mel Doelz to develop new methods of encoding or modulating voice and data signals with precisely shaped pulses that formed a binary code. Such techniques make very efficient use of bandwidth and virtually eliminate the noise and signal distortion that often plagues conventional radio. Based on this research, the Collins KINEPLEX long distance telecommunication system offered in 1955 up to 40 channels compared to one voice or data channel in the same bandwidth with conventional telephone service. A key component of KINEPLEX was the world's first practical, mass-produced MODEM (modulator/demodulator), in essence a translator between binary and analog signals. The classified Collins Navy Tactical Data System (NTDS) derived from this work.\n\nArthur Collins was among the first to predict the coming computer and telecommunication revolution, and led his engineers to combine the lessons of KINEPLEX with communication expertise to establish in the early 1960s a data and message switching facility in Cedar Rapids, using Collins C8400 computers to process reservation and other data traffic for the airlines. Collins Radio also designed and built microwave communications systems, supplying both the basic equipment and also relay towers, often in remote, mountain top locations, to transmit the line-of-sight signal over long distances.\n\nAmateur radio was never a dominant segment within the Collins Radio product line, but held a special interest for Arthur Collins since childhood and provided a key catalyst in design of other equipment. Collins amateur gear was always built to the highest standards and demanded a premium price. As part of KINEPLEX Collins developed the mechanical filter, a small device (about ¾ inch by 4 inches) using a series of precisely ground metallic discs linked mechanically and electrically. Determining the exact dimensions of these discs was critically important, and not easily discovered through empirical experimentation. A bright, young Indian mathematician named Roshan Sharma was fortuitously hired, based partly on his recent mastery of the necessary underlying mathematics needed to produce the resonating discs.\n\nAn input signal causes the first disc to mechanically resonate at a very precise and stable frequency, which passes an induced electrical oscillation to the next disc, and in turn sequentially through the device. By filtering out unnecessary portions of the radio signal, the mechanical filter (a kind of \"bandpass filter\") allows the use of a very stable, precise single sideband frequency. (Previously, single sideband operation required a large, complex piece of equipment.) The mechanical filter was the heart of Collins single sideband (SSB) technology, and made SSB practical for the first time. SSB offered clear, efficient radio communications, even during conditions that would disrupt and distort conventional radio signals.\n\nIn 1956 a SAC C-97 transport was fitted with Collins 75A-4 / KWM-1 SSB amateur gear for a demonstration of the superiority of SSB, leading to contracts for Collins SSB military equipment on B-52 and other aircraft, as well as ground stations. Sales far exceeded that of amateur sets.\n\nCollins antenna design and development began in 1951 with the challenging design and construction of a 50-ft. diameter parabolic \"dish\" antenna for the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC. Collins antenna expertise expanded in the following years to include pioneering designs for satellites, deep space ground stations, HF ground communication, aircraft communication and navigation, space craft, commercial broadcast, microwave, and other special applications.\nCollins Radio entered the field of space communications very early when in 1951 it designed and built an ultra-high frequency 20-kW transmitter on 418 MHz coupled to a high gain antenna with an unusual tapered horn shape, installed at its facilities at the Cedar Rapids Airport. On Nov. 8, 1951, two-way communications with a similar station at Sterling, Virginia was established for the first time by reflecting the UHF signal off the moon. The message \"What hath God wrought?\" was exchanged several times using Morse code over the half-million mile path.\n\nCollins Radio pioneered satellite communications in 1960 by constructing two large ground stations at its facilities in Cedar Rapids, IA and Richardson, TX. NASA launched the balloon-like ECHO I passive satellite on Aug. 12, 1960. On its third orbital pass over the Midwest, Collins became the first to establish two-way satellite voice communications by reflecting 10 kW signals at 810 MHz off the satellite. Six days later Collins became the first to transmit an image - of President Eisenhower - via satellite between its two stations.\n\nBeginning with the X-15 experimental rocket plane, Collins Radio supplied radio communication equipment to NASA for Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft, as well as ground stations and HF links to Mission Control. All American voices from space, as well as TV and data, were transmitted by Collins equipment. Peak sales for space communication systems were $69 M in 1966.\n\nArthur Collins' interest in computers predated his company's entry into this field. He is known to have travelled in the late 1930s to Iowa State College to visit John V. Atanasoff, the acknowledged inventor of the first digital computer, although unfortunately no records exist of their discussions. Arthur Collins had predicted in 1957 the need to combine computers with communication, using some of the technology developed as part of KINEPLEX and related work. Company sales increased through the 1960s, by 1968 reaching $440,000,000 (approx. $3 billion in today's currency) and employing 24,000. With this available capital, Collins Radio entered the computer market in the 1960s.\n\nUnder Collins' supervision, Collins Radio introduced the C8400 computer system, built using rack-mounted circuit cards, an unusual feature for computers of the day. A large computer communication center was established in Cedar Rapids in the 1960s, switching reservation data for the airlines, as well as in-house company data, with links to Dallas, Texas and Newport Beach in California.\n\nThe next generation C8500 computer used units similar to \"black boxes\" in avionics as part of a modular design. A Process Division was formed that combined the design and manufacture of planar circuit boards into one organization. Collins integrated circuits and other microelectronic components were mounted on Collins-built circuit boards. Modular construction allowed easy expansion of computer capability in response to demand, and provided benefits in manufacture and maintenance (boxes could be swapped). The Process Division and modular construction concepts were revolutionary, examples of the culture of innovation at Collins Radio, and a direct result of Arthur Collins' vision.\n\nArthur Collins was intensely involved in these efforts, bringing in outside telecommunication experts, and setting up classes for study of computer architecture and software design. The result was the \"C-System\", a distributed, ring network linking processors and peripheral equipment and functions, including manufacturing devices, inventory control, purchasing, and other administrative activities. Contemporary systems used IBM 360 or similar computers in highly centralized centers, serving only a few functions, and not linked to other similar centers. The C-System was designed to be flexible, able to expand to meet diverse needs, and accessible by a variety of users, not just computer specialists.\n\nThe C-System was extraordinarily innovative but as a consequence its scope and costs could not be predicted. Eventually it disrupted other programs and led to serious cost overruns, beyond funding sources. One of the main difficulties was the large size, relatively low density, and very high cost of computer memory, as demanded by the C-System.\n\nArthur Collins' vision of the potential for the C-System exceeded that of most of his staff, and certainly that of bankers or other funding sources. In spite of the negative effect on the company's finances, he insisted on continuing the development of the C-System, certain that it would be an eventual success. Unfortunately, the overall economy was in recession in the late 1960s, especially for highly specialized commercial and defense electronics. (For example, employment at Boeing dropped from 100,000 in 1968 to 32,500 in 1971. Lights out, Seattle; Seattle Times, Nov. 3, 1996). A difficult decision was made to form an alliance with North American Rockwell. Unable to meet short term financial goals, Arthur Collins was forced to leave the company in 1971.\n\nIronically, his vision of a distributed network of relatively small processors and computer work stations was exactly prescient. The seeds of the linked personal computers and of the Internet were to be found in the C-System. Computer memory quickly became faster, of higher capacity, and cheaper, but not soon enough to rescue the C-System.\n\nAfter leaving Collins Radio Arthur Collins formed a private research and development firm in Dallas TX, called Arthur A. Collins Inc. He hired a few key people, some from the old Collins Radio C-System group. His interest was in telecommunication and computer networks, specifically digital switch design for telephone networks, and later computer network design, which he titled \"Integrated Service Network\" (ISN). AACI developed its own internal email system in 1981, called \"Command I\". [\"I\" may stand for 'interconnect'.] Collins published a book on telecommunication entitled \"A Time for Innovation\", co-authored with Robert Pedersen, and his firm eventually was awarded several patents, some posthumously. Arthur Collins worked until his death from a stroke, having lived long enough to see the advent of the personal computer, the fiber optic cable and the beginning of the internet.\n\nThose who worked with Arthur Collins invariably mention his extraordinary work ethic, his penchant for long days and total concentration on fixed goals, and his expectation that others on his team should similarly put in long hours. He was skeptical of the concept of holidays, except perhaps for Christmas Day. Collins would ask his library assistant to compile books, journal articles and other select reading material. In a matter of only a few days these would be returned; he would by then have completely adsorbed their content, in preparation for the next phase of a project, and would then request a new batch.\n\nHe did not welcome dissent, unless accompanied by facts and logical argument, yet he sought out expertise outside his background. One mathematician and personal friend noted that Collins once described how he could visualize new and revolutionary concepts. He described his ideas in such detail and correctness that the underlying math could then be generated by others and would seem obvious in retrospect.\n\nThere is no doubt that part of the company's success was due to Arthur Collins' ability to seek out and recognize talented engineers and administrative staff. Collins Radio was known as a demanding workplace, but with the reward that absolutely cutting edge work was being done.\n\nProbably his most significant personal trait was Collins' ability to forecast society's future technological needs, to then define goals and begin developing the systems and devices necessary to achieve these goals. In this way he anticipated a customer's future needs, and would often have working models available well in advance of competitors. Examples would include the navigation aids and integrated flight control instruments build by Collins Radio following World War II, the binary modulation scheme of KINEPLEX and similar systems, SSB HF communication, and the melding of computers and communication - built on earlier work with telecommunication.\n\nUnder Arthur Collins' leadership Collins Radio devoted great resources to research and development and continually strove to advance the state of the art in concepts and technology, rather than producing consumer electronics with prolonged product lives and high income potential. The commercial aviation and defense electronic markets were inherently fickle and uncertain, often with relatively low profit margins, yet Collins Radio maintained its status as a premier company for four decades during Arthur Collins' tenure. The consensus among his peers is that this longevity was due in large part to his imagination, vision, and genius for innovation.\n\nFor an expert in communication, Arthur Collins was inherently shy and soft-spoken, comfortable in his authority without bluster. He had a rich sense of humor, fully expressed only in the company of close friends and associates. He avoided undue publicity, and extended this demeanor to his company by cautioning restraint in advertising and public relations. When the CBS anchor Walter Cronkite called asking for an interview during the Apollo landings, Collins demurred and told Cronkite that he didn't want to take personal credit for the hard work of many others at Collins Radio.\n\n\"It is necessary that we marshal the combined powers of many scientific and engineering disciplines together with man's other creative and spiritual faculties in an effort to build a decent and meaningful world. Whatever your field may be, your progress will depend upon your individual imagination. I urge you to give it free rein.\"—Arthur A. Collins\n\nThis article is provided by the Arthur A.

It was unmarked and supposedly untraceable to country of origin or manufacture in order to maintain plausible deniability of covert operators in the event of their death or capture.\nThe SOG Knife was designed by Benjamin Baker, the Deputy Chief of the U.S. Counterinsurgency Support Office (CISO). A chrome-moly steel known as SKS-3 was chosen for the blade and hardened to a Rockwell hardness of 55-57. The blade pattern featured a convex false edge on the clip point of a Bowie knife. The stacked leather handle was inspired by a Marbles Gladstone Skinning Knife made in the 1920s owned by Baker, into which finger grooves were molded. The blade was typically parkerized or blackened to reduce glare. This was done so by applying a dark gun-blue finish (similar to those used on guns) on this SK-3 carbon steel knife. The knife was carried in a leather sheath which contained a sharpening steel or whetstone.\n\nThe first contract was awarded to Japanese Trading Company Yogi Shokai, Okinawa for 1,300 seven-inch blades designated \"Knife, indigenous, RECON, 7\", w/scabbard & whetstone\" at $9.85 each. In 1966, SOG ordered 1,200 sterile knives with six-inch blades and black sheaths and in March of the following year an additional lot of 3,700 was ordered. This second lot was serial numbered for accountability purposes and was designated \"Knife, indigenous, hunting, 6\", w/black sheath and whetstone\". Further knives were ordered from Japan Sword, Tokyo as well. The orders were actually fulfilled by a number of knifemakers and as a result, the various lots had minor differences\nsuch as blade bluing color and guard color or shape. Although the SOG office based at Kadena and Yogi Shokai were in Okinawa, it is believed that only a major knifemaking source like Seki could have fulfilled all these orders,\n\nIn 1986, a company named SOG Specialty Knives based in Santa Monica, California marketed a knife very similar to the original SOG knife manufactured in Seki City, Japan and marked it with the US Army Special Forces Crest., and named it the \"S1 Bowie\", using blued SK5 carbon steel for the blade. It was a replica of the commemorative versions of the original MACV-SOG knives, rather than the actual sterile unmarked knives used in combat. SOG made a version with an Aus8 stainless steel blade and black micarta handle in commemoration of the U.S. Navy SEALs., known as the \"SOG S2 Trident\". \nThe other Vietnam replica knife is known as the \"Recon Bowie\" by SOG with a distinctive banana shaped 7 inch blade. This type of knife was actually the first to go into service in Vietnam.\nThe last replica knife is the \"SCUBA/Demo\" which was introduced in 2001, and represents the rarest knife\nin this group as only one true original is reported to exist, It was created for and assigned to the\nUSN Advisory Detachment, which operated coastal gunboats. The S1 and S2 knives were manufactured by Hattori of Seki under contract to SOG Knives USA from 1986 to 2005, after which SOG shifted to Taiwan manufacture.\nHattori also manufactured the three commemorative SOG bowies for Boker, for sale in the European market.\nReplicas of the SOG knife have also been made by Al Mar Knives, Ek Knives, Tak Fukuta for Parker, and Strider Knives. \nSOG also contracted with Kinryu Co. Ltd of Seki Japan to manufacture the Recon Bowie and the Scuba Demo\nuntil 2007. None of these knives, however, are currently used by any branch of the US Military in an official capacity. Original models are extremely valuable collector's items among both knife collectors and militaria collectors.

The National Alliance's 5-man Executive Committee, a think-tank created by Erich Gliebe five months earlier to explore new ideas, issued a formal declaration called \"A Time for Leadership.\" The declaration decried then-Chairman Erich Gliebe's dissolution of the National Alliance Board of Directors and his reducing of its composition to include merely himself and COO Shaun Walker. It called for a reconstitution of the Board of Directors, and the merger of the Board with the Executive Committee in both membership and function. Gliebe and Walker rejected the declaration.\n\nIn response, Gliebe and Walker claimed that Kevin Strom was not performing his job well as editor of the National Alliance's magazine, which was sometimes months late. There was a pay dispute where Kevin Strom claimed that Shaun Walker was not paying Strom his full salary, which became a public dispute within Internet chatrooms. This pay dispute and other internal conflicts created an atmosphere of factional personality conflicts which grew for 6 months until they erupted.\n\nThere were no legal options to take, so in April 2005 \"National Vanguard\" was formally organized by some former National Alliance Unit Coordinators and five members of the Executive Committee.\n\nThe main issues cited for the split with the National Alliance were over the creation of an expanded Board of Directors, prompt and professional publishing of a news-magazine and open accounting of all funds collected. The new organization picked Kevin Alfred Strom as its new leader, but a Board of Directors was not created. Within 8 months half of all National Vanguard members had either resigned or formed another new group. Most of the key leaders who planned the initial coup from the National Alliance group quit the National Vanguard within 15 months, but without all the open Internet airing of \"internal laundry.\" In January 2007 Strom was arrested by the FBI and Federal Marshals for child pornography related charges. In 2008 he pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography (although he maintains that the possession was inadvertent) and was sentenced to 23 months in prison.\n\nAs of May 2015, National Vanguard maintains an active website featuring daily articles and updates.\n\nSince the reorganization of National Vanguard, the group has been focused upon unit meetings and the distribution of fliers. A boycott against the hardware chain The Home Depot was started because of its stance on illegal immigrants. Units in Florida, Nevada, and New Jersey appear to be the most active. Members are attempting to form a new political party in Nevada: the White People's Party. One plank in the party's platform calls for \"the White Race\" to be placed on the endangered species list since \"all relevant laws are working against the continued existence of Whites.\"\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which struck the US Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005, a National Vanguard First Response Team was organized to help white families in Alabama and Mississippi on September 20, 2005. Their decision to only help white victims has been described as reprehensible.\n\nIn 2005, National Vanguard showcased the pop-music duo Prussian Blue, twin sisters from Bakersfield, California, Lynx and Lamb Gaede, whom the organization hoped would \"be breaking new ground... creating an entire genre of pro-White music\" that will cross over to mainstream audiences. Their mother, April, is a writer and activist for National Vanguard.\n\n\nCritical\n"}

Throughout its existence, it was the only Division in the Northern Territory. At the redistribution of 21 December 2000, the Division was divided into two new divisions, which were named the Division of Solomon, which covered the area immediately around Darwin, and the Division of Lingiari, which covered the remainder of the territory.\n\nUntil 1911, the Northern Territory was a part of South Australia and from 1890 was represented in the South Australian House of Assembly by two members from the Electoral district of Northern Territory. From 1863 to 1911, Territorians had the same voting rights for representatives in both Houses of the South Australian Parliament as people living in South Australia. (see Suffrage in Australia.) This status had also qualified them as South Australian voters to vote in elections for both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament after 1901, which entitled both women and Indigenous Australians there to a vote. In 1911, however, the Northern Territory was transferred to the Commonwealth government, which also had the effect of depriving Territorians of all political representation. The first Commonwealth census held in 1911 disclosed the Territory had a non-Aboriginal population of 3,271, comprising 2,673 males and 598 females.\n\nNational governments shied away from a hypothetical impasse where a few hundred Territory voters might some day hold the balance of power in an evenly divided Commonwealth Parliament, but the Commonwealth Constitution did not allow for Federal electorates to cross state borders. The lack of representation became a significant factor in the trades union agitation, called the Darwin Rebellion, that led to the recall of the first Commonwealth-appointed Administrator, John A. Gilruth, in 1918 and the forced exit of his three leading officials eight months later. The Territory's non-indigenous population had increased to only 3572 by 1921. In 1922, the \"Northern Territory Representation Act 1922\" was passed by the Australian Parliament to give the Territory a single non-voting member in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe federal Division of Northern Territory was first contested at the 1922 federal election. Its first member was Harold George Nelson, who had led the agitation which unseated the Administrator in 1918. In 1927, the Northern Territory was split into the separate territories of Central Australia and North Australia; there remained only one electoral division and the split was reversed in 1931. Before 1968, the Member for Northern Territory did not have full voting rights, and did not count for the purposes of forming government. Between 1922 and 1936, he could speak in the House and take part in committee work, but could not vote. Between 1936 and 1959 he was only able to veto motions to disallow laws made for the Territory, and between 1959 and 1968, he could only vote on matters relating to the Territory alone. In 1968, the Member for Northern Territory acquired full voting rights.\n\nThe Division of Northern Territory was divided on 21 December 2000 into two new divisions – Solomon, which covered the Darwin area, and the Lingiari, which covers the remainder of the Territory – with Warren Snowdon, the last member for the united division, transferring to Lingiari.\n\nOn 19 February 2003, the new Divisions were nominally abolished and the Territory returned to a single Division, but on 28 April 2004 the \"Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Act 2004\" passed by the Australian Parliament had the effect of leaving the Northern Territory divided into two Divisions.\n"}
{"id": "2147465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147465", "title": "Lens hood", "text": "Lens hood\n\nIn photography, a lens hood or lens shade is a device used on the front end of a lens to block the Sun or other light source(s) to prevent glare and lens flare. Lens hoods may also be used to protect the lens from scratches and the elements without having to put on a lens cover.\nThe geometry of a lens hood is dependent on three parameters: the focal length of the lens, the size of the front lens element and the dimensions of the image sensor or film in the camera.\n\nFlare occurs when stray light strikes the front element of a lens and then bounces around within the lens. This stray light often comes from very bright light sources, such as the Sun, bright studio lights, or a bright white background. If a light source is in the lens' angle of view, a lens hood will hardly have any effect, but the light does not have to cause lens flare. It is sufficient that stray light from a bright light source enters the lens. Multi-layer coatings in newer lenses also help to reduce lens flare.\n\nThe shape of a lens hood can vary from a plain cylindrical or conical section (much like a lamp shade) to a more complex shape, sometimes called a petal, tulip, or flower hood. These more complex shapes take into account the final image's shape and aspect ratio. This allows the lens hood to block stray light with the longer portions of the lens hood, while allowing more light into the corners of the image through the shorter portions of the hood, thereby reducing the amount of mechanical vignetting (reduction of light around the periphery) in the final image.\n\nThe geometry of a lens hood is dependent on three things:\nIdeally, lens hoods should increase in length, and therefore in efficiency, as the focal length of the lens increases and the angle of view reduces. Lens hoods are more prominent in long focus lenses because they have a smaller viewing angle than that of wide-angle lenses. For wide angle lenses, the length of the hood (away from the end of the lens) cannot be as long as those for telephoto lenses, as a longer hood would enter the wider field of view of the lens.\n\nMaximum aperture also affects the shape of a lens hood. As the aperture gets larger the amount of light and consequentially the amount of the frame the sensor \"sees\" increases. This can be seen when comparing two lens hoods of the same focal length but with differing apertures – compare the lens hood of a telephoto 4 lens with that of the same lens but with a maximum aperture of 2.8.\n\nCorrectly made rectangular or square lens hoods are generally more efficient than cylindrical or conical ones because those shapes closely resemble the shape of the photograph. However, rectangular or square lens hoods should not be used with zoom lenses whose front elements rotate as the focal length is changed, as the hood will rotate as well, blocking parts of the angle of view. The same also applies to petal lens hoods. For these types of lenses, only cylindrical or conical lens hoods will work effectively.\n\nIn addition, lens hoods can offer some degree of physical protection for the lens due to the hood extending farther than the lens itself.\n\nLens hoods with an extending bellows design (much like the bellows of a medium or large format camera) can be adjusted for depth. This means that the depth can be increased when used on longer focal length lenses, and reduced as necessary for shorter focal length lenses.\n\nLens hoods that are supplied by the manufacturer of the lens are often designed to fit onto the matching lens facing either forward, for normal use, or backwards, so that the hood may be stored with the lens without occupying much additional space. Rubber lens hoods are flexible and generally collapse for storage. However other lens hoods must be removed if these features are not available and length extension of the lens is not preferred during storage.\n\n\n"}

He is the founder and head of Dimension Films, former co-chairman of Lantern Entertainment, Miramax Films, and The Weinstein Company, both of which he co-founded with his brother Harvey. He has focused on making commercially successful action and horror films.\n\nWeinstein was born in Flushing, New York. He was raised in a Jewish Ashkenazi family. His parents were Max Weinstein, a diamond cutter, and Miriam (\"née\" Postel). He grew up with his older brother, Harvey Weinstein, in a housing co-op named Electchester in New York City. and attended John Bowne High School like his older brother.\n\nBob, his brother Harvey Weinstein, and Corky Burger independently produced rock concerts as Harvey & Corky Productions in Buffalo through most of the 1970s. Both Weinstein brothers had grown up with a passion for movies, and they nurtured a desire to enter the film industry.\n\nIn the late 1970s, using profits from their concert promotion business, the brothers created a small independent film distribution company called Miramax, named after their parents – Miriam and Max. The company's first releases were primarily music-oriented concert films, such as Paul McCartney's \"Rockshow\". In the early 1980s, Miramax acquired the rights to two British films of benefit shows filmed for the human rights organization Amnesty International. Working closely with Martin Lewis, the producer of the original films, the Weinstein brothers edited the two films into one movie tailored for the American market. The resulting film, released as \"The Secret Policeman's Other Ball\" in May 1982, became Miramax's first hit. The movie raised considerable sums for Amnesty International and was credited by Amnesty with having helped to raise its profile in the US.\n\nThe Weinsteins slowly built upon this success throughout the 1980s with arthouse films that achieved critical attention and modest commercial success. Harvey Weinstein and Miramax gained wider attention in 1988 with the release of Errol Morris' documentary \"The Thin Blue Line\", which detailed the struggle of Randall Adams, a wrongfully convicted inmate sentenced to death row. The publicity that soon surrounded the case resulted in Adams' release and nationwide publicity for Miramax. The following year, their successful launch release of Steven Soderbergh's \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\" propelled Miramax to become the most successful independent studio in America.\n\nMiramax continued to grow its library of films and directors until, in 1993, Disney offered Harvey and Bob $80 million for ownership of Miramax. Agreeing to the deal that would cement their Hollywood clout and ensure that they would remain at the head of their company, Miramax followed the next year with their first blockbuster, Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\".\n\n1996 brought Miramax's first Academy Award for Best Picture with the victory of \"The English Patient\". This would start a string of critical successes that would include \"Shakespeare in Love\" and \"Good Will Hunting\".\n\nOn March 29, 2005, it was announced that the Weinstein brothers would leave Miramax on September 30 and would form their own production company, The Weinstein Company. Five years later, in 2010, Disney sold Miramax to the Qatari group Filmyard Holdings, who in turn sold it to another Qatari entity, the beIN Media Group, in 2016.\n\nOn December 4, 2017, Bob Weinstein filed a trademark application for Watch This Entertainment. Almost two years later, Weinstein announced his new production company to the world, with a focus on \"family films, comedies and upscale adult thrillers,\" and a first project of an animated feature titled \"Endangered\", with Téa Leoni serving as co-producer and voicing a lead character.\n\nWeinstein has been married twice. He has two daughters, Sara and Nicole, from his first marriage. Weinstein married Anne Clayton, a former book editor, in 2000. They have two children and lived in a large apartment in The Beresford at 7 West 81st Street on the Upper West Side.\n\nAnne filed for divorce in April 2012, and sought a protective order because she feared \"bodily harm\". Weinstein issued a statement from Don Sloane, a Washington-based interventionist who denied that Weinstein was a danger to his wife, and who said that Anne was reacting to a family intervention conducted to address her alcoholism. Anne's lawyers denied that their client suffered from any addiction, and said that Sloane's statement was from Weinstein's paid agent, who had never met Anne Weinstein.\n\nIn October 2017, he talked about his estranged brother Harvey Weinstein and the allegations of sexual harassment, abuse, and rape against him and called his brother \"wicked and depraved.\" In the interview, Bob denied knowing about any of the allegations against his brother, but acknowledged that Harvey had a history of extramarital affairs and verbal abuse towards family members.\n\n\n\n\nNote: In all productions Weinstein has functioned as a co-producer with other producers.\n"}
{"id": "2147499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147499", "title": "Edgar Tekere", "text": "Edgar Tekere\n\nEdgar Zivanai Tekere (1 April 1937 – 7 June 2011), nicknamed \"2 Boy\", was a Zimbabwean politician. He was the second and last Secretary General of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) who organised the party during the Lancaster House talks and served in government before his popularity as a potential rival to Robert Mugabe caused their estrangement.\n\nDuring the war, Tekere served on the ZANU high command, or Dare reChimurenga. He was detained by the Rhodesian government at Gonakudzingwa.\n\nEdgar Zivanai \"2-Boy\" (\"nom de guerre\") Tekere was an early ally of Robert Mugabe within the Zimbabwe African National Union (of which he was a founder member in 1964) during the fight for independence and against the Rhodesian Front government of Ian Smith. Mugabe and Tekere, having served eleven and a half years in Hwa-Hwa Penitentiary & Gonakudzingwa State Prison as political prisoners of Ian Smith's government, immediately left upon release and crossed the Eastern Highlands Border in Mutare through the mountains by foot, following the Gairezi river trail to Seguranza military camp in Mozambique, to mastermind and kickstart guerilla warfare, aided by Samora Machel, in 1975. The Bush War or \"Second Chimurenga\" raged on. harassment of Tekere's close family members and relatives by the platoon of Rhodesian Front Soldiers, Selous Scouts, Police Special Branch and Central Intelligence Organisation, under the auspices of Ian Smith.\n\nDuring these trying times Edgar Tekere received the code name/nickname (\"Mukoma\") by close family members and relatives. Tekere was elected by a democratic process to be the first ZANU-PF Secretary-General following Zimbabwe's independence.\n\nEdgar Tekere being the ZANU-PF Secretary General, personally invited Bob Marley to perform at Rufaro Stadium, for the official Zimbabwean Independence Celebration. Marley's music was inspirational to the guerilla fighters whilst they were in the bush fighting. More than 100,000 Zimbabweans attended the concert, and Bob Marley performed the song \"Zimbabwe\", an unofficial Zimbabwean anthem. He also stayed with Edgar Tekere during this tour date.\n\nWhen ZANU won the 1980 elections, Tekere was appointed as Minister of Manpower Planning in Mugabe's Cabinet. He followed his appointment by making a series of outspoken speeches that went far beyond government policy. Shortly after his appointment, on 4 August 1980 he greeted then-Prime Minister Mugabe and visiting President of Mozambique Samora Machel in combat fatigues, announcing that he was going \"to fight a battle.\" Tekere and his bodyguards went looking for supporters of Joshua Nkomo's ZAPU outside Harare but, failing to find them, went onto a neighbouring farm and shot white farm manager Gerald Adams..\"\n\nTekere retained his government post when he went on trial together with seven bodyguards who were all former guerrilla fighters in the independence war. On 8 December the High Court, on a majority decision, found him not guilty of murder. Both assessors, over-ruling the judge, held that while Tekere had killed Adams, he was acting in terms of an utter conviction that State Security was at risk.\n\nIt is important to note that now with Twenty First Century global research on war veterans it is believed that Tekere suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) which led to his erratic behaviour. At the trial, there was a lack of evidence led that Edgar Tekere and his platoon had first gone looking for ZAPU operatives before conducting a military style sweep of the farm on which the farmer was killed. There was also no evidence that he had said that he was proud to have killed Gerald Adams. State Counsel Chris Glaum did not put this to any of the defendants. The trial was presided over by Judge John Pitman J. There were two assessors, Christopher Navavie Greenland, a provincial magistrate, and Peter Khumbuyani Nemapare, a senior magistrate. The court was especially constituted to present as racially balance in that Judge Pitman was white, Greenland is mixed race, and Nemapare is black. It was the first and last time that a court was constituted in this way.\n\nTekere was represented by Louis Blom-Cooper QC, a flamboyant English counsel, and there were many confrontations between him and the presiding judge. The court was unanimous that Tekere was guilty of murder. However, by a majority, it found that as he had acted in \"good faith\" at the time, he was entitled to indemnification under a law that Ian Smith, the previous Rhodesian Prime Minister, had ironically enacted despite widespread opposition to protect his security forces during the Bush War. Any member of the country's security forces was exempt from conviction in respect of any crime committed if, at the time of commission, such member was acting in \"good faith\", acting in terms of a genuinely held conviction that the State's security interests were being served.\n\nGreenland wrote the judgement in which the two assessors over-ruled Pitman on this issue. It was the first time in the history of the country that assessors over-ruled a judge. The assessors found that Tekere presented with a personality and mindset which was completely consistent with an unreasonable but genuinely held belief that he was acting in the interest of state security with the confrontation between one of his men and the farmer, in which the latter was killed, an unfortunate consequence of the security sweep which Tekere genuinely believed needed to be conducted.\n\nIn his book \"The Other – without fear, favour or prejudice\" Greenland reveals, for the first time in 2010, that Judge Pitman made a surprising and inexplicable \"about-face\", having first been firmly of the view that Tekere was entitled to the indemnity and then changing his mind without proffering good reason.\n\nTekere was dismissed from the government on 11 January 1981, a decision he was reported to be happy with; he retained the Secretary-Generalship of ZANU. In April 1981 he was detained by Kenyan security forces to prevent him from speaking to students after giving a newspaper interview in which he said he was proud of the killing of Gerald Adams. In July, Tekere referred to some ZANU representatives as having \"inherited the colonial mentality,\" which was straining relations between them and the party's supporters. Mugabe hit back by saying \"Those who are complaining that the revolution is not continuing... are the most immoral and laziest in the party.\" Tekere was increasingly seen as a leader of a rival faction to Mugabe, and was dismissed as Secretary-General on 9 August with Mugabe taking the post himself.\n\nAfter criticising corruption in the party, in August 1984 Tekere was elected to the Central Committee of ZANU-PF and carried shoulder-high from the Congress; he was also being supported by the Whites in Zimbabwe after opposing the farm squats by ZANU-PF supporters which he described as \"donga watonga\" (chaotic government). He was provincial chairman of ZANU-PF in Mutare.\n\nTekere supported Mugabe at the 1985 elections but by October 1988 his consistent criticism of corruption resulted in his expulsion from the party. When Mugabe voiced his belief that Zimbabwe would be better governed as a one party state, Tekere strongly disagreed, saying \"A one-party state was never one of the founding principles of ZANU-PF and experience in Africa has shown that it brought the evils of nepotism, corruption and inefficiency.\"\n\nHe ran against Robert Mugabe in the 1990 Presidential race as the candidate of the Zimbabwe Unity Movement, offering a broadly free market platform against Mugabe's communist-style economic planning. Edgar Tekere received unprecedented support for his opposition to Mugabe which led to massive election rigging by ZANU in order for Mugabe to win the election on 1 April 1990 receiving 2,026,976 votes while Tekere only got 413,840 (16% of the vote). At the simultaneous Parliamentary elections the ZUM won 20% of the vote but only two seats in the House of Assembly. Zimbabwe Unity Movement supporters were the targets of violent attacks from supporters of ZANU (PF) and five candidates were murdered.\n\nTekere dropped out of sight after the election, fuelling rumours that he was planted as an opposition figure. In 2005 he voiced his wish to stand as a ZANU (PF) candidate for the Senate of Zimbabwe but was rebuffed. In 2006 it was reported that he had rejoined ZANU (PF). A letter sent to him by ZANU (PF) national chairman John Nkomo dated 7 April 2006 said \"You will not exercise your right to be elected to any office in the party for a period of five years. You will be required to uphold all the duties of a member listed in Article 3, Section 18 of the amended Zanu PF constitution\".\n\nAt a rally on 2 March 2008 in Highfield, a suburb of Harare, Tekere endorsed Simba Makoni, an independent candidate who was running against Mugabe in the March 2008 presidential election. Tekere said that he was \"appointing [him]self principal campaigner for Mugabe's downfall\".\n\nOn Sunday, 16 August 2009, at Sakubva Stadium in Mutare in Manicaland. Edgar Tekere was the guest of honour for the MDC in front of a crowd of 40,000 people who had gathered to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding and formation of the MDC political party led by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai.\n\nEdgar \"2-Boy\" Zivanai Tekere died noon on Tuesday 7 June 2011, at Murambi Clinic, in Mutare, Manicaland. This occurred following a long battle with prostate cancer, and had a medical history of suffering from undiagnosed post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a military war veteran which brought about erratic intermittent alcoholism behaviour tendencies. With recent evidence based research on PTSD military veterans from the Iraqi & Afghanistan Wars, there is more understanding of PTSD and how it affects the military veterans when they integrate into civil society post-war. Tekere was 74 years old.\n\nEdgar \"2-Boy\" Tekere was unanimously declared a national hero by the ZANU-PF Politburo.\n"}
{"id": "2147500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147500", "title": "Down in the Groove", "text": "Down in the Groove\n\nDown in the Groove is the 25th studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on May 30, 1988 by Columbia Records.\n\nA highly collaborative effort, it was Dylan's second consecutive album to receive almost unanimous negative reviews. Released during a period when his recording career was experiencing a slump, sales were disappointing, reaching only number 61 in the U.S. and number 32 in the UK.\n\n\"Even by Dylan standards, this album has had a strange, difficult birth,\" wrote \"Rolling Stone\" critic David Fricke. \"Its release was delayed for more than half a year, and the track listing was altered at least three times. If the musician credits are any indication, the songs that made the final cut come from half a dozen different recording sessions spread out over six years.\" Like its predecessor \"Knocked Out Loaded\", Dylan once again used more collaborators than normal.\nIn a review published in his \"Consumer Guide\" column, Robert Christgau wrote, \"Where \"Self Portrait\" was at least weird, splitting the difference between horrible and hilarious, [Dylan is now] forever professional—not a single remake honors or desecrates the original. All he can do to a song is Dylanize it, and thus his Danny Kortchmar band and his Steve Jones-Paul Simonon band are indistinguishable, immersed in that patented and by now meaningless one-take sound.\" Christgau would later call \"Down in the Groove\" \"horrendous product\".\n\nRecently coming off of the album \"Knocked Out Loaded\", Dylan took the opportunity to further work on his collaborative efforts. The album features several guest appearances for the first time. Most prominent was the appearance of The Grateful Dead, who provided the album with one of its notable high spots with the single \"Silvio\". The track was later included on \"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3\" and \"The Essential Bob Dylan\".\n\nAs stated in the \"Encyclopedia of Popular Music\", the album shares no single recording session. This created a tone that the \"Encyclopedia\" described as, \"raucous to pensive to sombre in a heartbeat.\"\n\nIn the book \"Bob Dylan: The Recording Sessions, 1960-1994\", author Clinton Heylin offers an explanation for the style and layout of the album's tracks. He states, \"As it is, Dylan's intent all along may have been to show the rich vein of music he listened to when growing up in Hibbing.\" The author goes on further to describe how the album was a sensible step for Dylan, suggesting his issues with creative writing had hampered his ability to produce new material.\n\nA unique aspect of the album was the \"garage rock\"-type tour that followed. Dylan's previous tour had placed a heavy emphasis on guest appearances to allow for a more variety themed show. The intimate nature of the smaller band allowed the artists to interpret songs differently each time they played. Often the performances held little resemblance to prior shows.\n\nIn his review for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, Fricke noted that \"a highly anticipated—if somewhat unlikely—collaboration with Full Force, the top Brooklyn hip-hop posse, turned out to be an old \"Infidels\" outtake, 'Death Is Not the End,' newly garnished with some tasty but rather superfluous Full Force vocal harmonies.\" \"Death Is Not the End\" was covered by Nick Cave in 1996.\n\nIn 2007, \"Rolling Stone\" labeled \"Down in the Groove\" as Bob Dylan's worst album. In 2017, the magazine added that \"Dylan fans will forever argue about the precise moment when [Dylan's] career hit rock-bottom but most pin it somewhere around the time that \"Down in the Groove\" landed with a thud in record stores in May 1988.\"\n\nArtist Rick Griffin, primarily known for the Grateful Dead's logos and poster art, was commissioned to design the cover of the record jacket. Griffin's drawing of a man playing a guitar while riding a horse backwards was rejected by Columbia Records who instead used a photograph of Dylan.\n\nSoon after \"Down in the Groove\"'s release, Dylan embarked on a summer tour of North America, presumably in support of the album. The first show was on June 7, 1988, at Concord Pavilion in Concord, California, and it was a dramatic shift from previous tours. In recent years, Dylan had relied on larger ensembles, often staffed with high-profile artists like Mick Taylor, Ian McLagan, the Grateful Dead, and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. This time, Dylan organized his concerts around a small, \"garage rock\"-type combo, consisting of guitarist G.E. Smith (of \"Saturday Night Live\" fame), bassist Kenny Aaronson, and drummer Christopher Parker. (There was a notable exception in the early June shows; those concerts featured a second, lead guitarist in Neil Young, whose own career was also in a downturn at the time.)\n\nSong selection also became more adventurous, with setlists from different nights offering little resemblance to one another. The concerts would also alternate between full-band, electric sets and smaller, acoustic sets (with Smith providing Dylan's only accompaniment); it was during the acoustic sets that Dylan incorporated an endless variety of traditional cover songs, a marked departure from previous shows that depended heavily on his own compositions.\n\nThe concerts initially received modest attention, but they would soon receive a generous amount of praise. The tour schedule was also surprising for a man of Dylan's age, as Dylan was spending most of his time on the road. Just as one leg of the tour would end, Dylan would schedule another leg soon after, and this would continue for many years to come. As a result, Dylan's shows are now often referred to as the \"Never Ending Tour\". Though the supporting personnel would undergo a number of changes for years to come, the basic format begun in the summer of 1988 would continue to this day.\n\nAdapted from the album liner notes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2147511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147511", "title": "Ultrasonic motor", "text": "Ultrasonic motor\n\nAn ultrasonic motor is a type of electric motor powered by the ultrasonic vibration of a component, the stator, placed against another component, the rotor or slider depending on the scheme of operation (rotation or linear translation). Ultrasonic motors differ from piezoelectric actuators in several ways, though both typically use some form of piezoelectric material, most often lead zirconate titanate and occasionally lithium niobate or other single-crystal materials. The most obvious difference is the use of resonance to amplify the vibration of the stator in contact with the rotor in ultrasonic motors. Ultrasonic motors also offer arbitrarily large\nrotation or sliding distances, while piezoelectric actuators are limited by the static strain that may be induced in the piezoelectric element.\n\nOne common application of ultrasonic motors is in camera lenses where they are used to move lens elements as part of the auto-focus system. Ultrasonic motors replace the noisier and often slower micro-motor in this application.\n\nDry friction is often used in contact, and the ultrasonic vibration induced in the stator is used both to impart motion to the rotor and to modulate the frictional forces present at the interface. The friction modulation allows bulk motion of the rotor (i.e., for farther than one vibration cycle); without this modulation, ultrasonic motors would fail to operate.\n\nTwo different ways are generally available to control the friction along the stator-rotor contact interface, traveling-wave vibration and standing-wave vibration. Some of the earliest versions of practical motors in the 1970s, by Sashida, for example, used standing-wave vibration in combination with fins placed at an angle to the contact surface to form a motor, albeit one that rotated in a single direction. Later designs by Sashida and researchers at Matsushita, ALPS, and \nCanon made use of traveling-wave vibration to obtain bi-directional motion, and found that this arrangement offered better efficiency and less contact interface wear. An exceptionally high-torque 'hybrid transducer' ultrasonic motor uses circumferentially-poled and axially-poled piezoelectric elements together to combine axial and torsional vibration along the contact interface, representing a driving technique that lies somewhere between the standing and traveling-wave driving methods.\n\nA key observation in the study of ultrasonic motors is that the peak vibration that may be induced in structures occurs at a relatively constant \"vibration velocity\" regardless of frequency. The vibration velocity is simply the time derivative of the vibration displacement in a structure, and is not (directly) related to the speed of the wave propagation within a structure. Many engineering materials suitable for vibration permit a peak vibration velocity of around 1 m/s. At low frequencies — 50 Hz, say — a vibration velocity of 1 m/s in a woofer would give displacements of about 10 mm, which is visible. As the frequency is increased, the displacement decreases, and the acceleration increases. As the vibration becomes inaudible at 20 kHz or so, the vibration displacements are in the tens of micrometers, and motors have been built that operate using 50 MHz surface acoustic wave\n(SAW) that have vibrations of only a few nanometers in magnitude. Such devices require care in construction to meet the necessary precision to make use of these motions within the stator.\n\nMore generally, there are two types of motors, contact and non-contact, the latter of which is rare and requires a working fluid to transmit the ultrasonic vibrations of the stator toward the rotor. Most versions use air, such as some of the earliest versions by Hu Junhui. Research in this area\ncontinues, particularly in near-field acoustic levitation for\nthis sort of application. (This is different from far-field acoustic levitation,\nwhich suspends the object at half to several wavelengths away from\nthe vibrating object.)\n\nCanon was one of the pioneers of the ultrasonic motor, and made the \"USM\" famous in the late 1980s by incorporating it into its autofocus lenses for the Canon EF lens mount. Numerous patents on ultrasonic motors have been filed by Canon, its chief lensmaking rival Nikon, and other industrial concerns since the early 1980s. Canon has not only included an ultrasonic motor (USM) in their DSLR lenses, but also in the Canon PowerShot SX1 IS bridge camera. The ultrasonic motor is now used in many consumer and office electronics requiring precision rotations over long periods of time.\n\nThe technology has been applied to photographic lenses by a variety of companies under different names:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most of the criticism was directed at the slick sound of pop producer Don Was, as well as a handful of tracks that seem rooted in children's nursery rhymes. It is a rarity in Dylan's catalog for its inclusion of celebrity cameos by Jimmie Vaughan, Slash, Elton John, George Harrison, David Crosby, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Bruce Hornsby.\n\nThe album is dedicated to \"Gabby Goo Goo\", later explained to be a nickname for Dylan's four-year-old daughter. This has led to the popular assumption that the album's more childlike songs were for her entertainment, something that has never been confirmed nor denied by Dylan.\n\nFour songs from the album, \"Handy Dandy\", \"10,000 Men\", \"God Knows\", and \"Cat's in the Well\", were recorded in a single session in Los Angeles on 6 January 1990, before Dylan commenced a four-week tour. (\"Handy Dandy\" received overdubs subsequently.) Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin writes that Dylan finished recording the basic tracks for the album in mid-March 1990, but added new vocals to some tracks the following month, with instrumental overdub sessions extending into May 1990. \n\nUnlike the rest of his discography, the album features numerous guest appearances by established artists, such as Bruce Hornsby, Elton John and George Harrison. Additionally, session musicians like pianist Al Kooper and guitarist Waddy Wachtel appear throughout the album. The album opener, \"Wiggle Wiggle\", also features Slash on guitar, while \"10,000 Men\" features Stevie Ray Vaughan. The title track features a \"fine guitar solo\" by George Harrison; Heylin has called this track an \"important song\", noting that it has been a staple of Dylan's live performances. \n\nTwo songs, \"Born in Time\" and \"God Knows\", are reworkings of material originally recorded at the previous year's \"Oh Mercy\" sessions. Versions of these songs from the \"Oh Mercy\" sessions are included on \"\". The intro to \"Unbelievable\" (which was released as a single, with an accompanying promotional video) is very similar to the intro on Carl Perkins's \"Honey Don't\", as sung by The Beatles on \"Beatles for Sale\".\n\nAccording to producer Don Was, there were two outtakes from the album: \"Shirley Temple Doesn't Live Here Anymore\" (which Dylan co-wrote with Was and David Weiss) and \"Heartland\" (which Dylan later sang with Willie Nelson on Nelson's 1993 album \"Across the Borderline\"). \"Shirley Temple Doesn't Live Here Anymore\" was later recorded by Don Was's group Was (Not Was) for their 2008 album \"Boo!\" as \"Mr. Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\".\n\nDylan has echoed most critics' complaints, telling \"Rolling Stone\" in a 2006 interview that the album's shortcomings resulted from hurried and unfocused recording sessions, due in part to his activity with the Traveling Wilburys at the time. He also claimed that there were too many people working on the album, and that he was very disillusioned with the recording industry during this period of his career.\n\nDylan critic Patrick Humphries, author of \"The Complete Guide to the Music of Bob Dylan\", was particularly harsh in his assessment of \"Under the Red Sky\", stating the album \"was everything \"Oh Mercy\" wasn't—sloppily written songs, lazily performed and unimaginatively produced. The first bridge of \"2 X 2\" (\"How much poison did they inhale?\") was reminiscent of the menace which pervaded \"Oh Mercy\", but otherwise, where before there had been certainty and sureness, here was confusion and indecision.\"\n\nHumphries saved his harshest attack for the album's opening song, \"Wiggle Wiggle\":\nThe album did have some critical support, particularly from Robert Christgau of \"The Village Voice\", who wrote: \"To my astonishment, I think \"Under the Red Sky\" is Dylan's best album in 15 years, a record that may even signal a ridiculously belated if not totally meaningless return to form … It's fabulistic, biblical … the tempos are postpunk like it oughta be, with [Kenny] Aronoff's sprints and shuffles grooving ahead like '60s folk-rock never did.\" And Paul Nelson, writing for \"Musician\", called the album \"a deliberately throwaway masterpiece\". When the \"Voice\" held its Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1990, \"Under the Red Sky\" placed at #39.\n\nIn the end, album sales were disappointing, peaking at #38 on the US charts and #13 in the UK. According to the book \"Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan\", the disappointing record sales of this album made him depressed. On top of that, Dylan's second wife had just signed for divorce in August 1990.\n\nDylan continued the style of the album with his recording of the nursery rhyme \"This Old Man\", which was released on the Disney charity album \"For Our Children\" in 1991. For his follow-up album, \"Good As I Been to You\" (1992), Dylan went back to his acoustic roots, recording more serious songs.\n\nIn 2005, \"Q\" magazine included the lead-off track \"Wiggle Wiggle\" in a list of \"Ten Terrible Records by Great Artists\". Time Magazine placed \"Wiggle Wiggle\" on the list of The 10 Worst Bob Dylan Songs, noting that it \"sounds like the theme song to one of those tripped-out television shows beloved by toddlers and drug users\". The song was covered on the 2014 tribute album by Slash and Aaron Freeman. Its lyrics were also the namesake for the Danish pop/rock band Big Fat Snake.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

During periods where this segment of U.S. Route 27 (US 27) has been signed as I-124, it has served as a spur route of I-24 to downtown Chattanooga. The road segment has not been signed as I-124 since the late 1980s (it is marked on overhead signs and mile markers as US 27), and the Tennessee Department of Transportation official map no longer designates it as I-124, but some DOT publications still make reference to the designation.\n\nThe US 27 freeway diverges from I-24 just before the Moccasin Bend in the Tennessee River, continues north through downtown Chattanooga, and then across the Tennessee River as a limited-access freeway on the P. R. Olgiati Bridge. The river is the point at which the I-124 designation ends. After crossing the river, the freeway continues under the US 27 designation for another (beyond which the spur continues under the Tennessee State Route 111 designation for a further ).\n\nThe entire length of I-124 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense.\n\nThe route that is now I-124 was proposed in the 1950s by then-mayor of Chattanooga P.R. \"Rudy\" Olgiati to provide a secondary access across the Tennessee River and relieve congestion which had developed on the Market Street and Walnut Street Bridges. The section of highway between Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard was built between 1955 and 1959. The southern portion, located between I-24 and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, was built between 1961 and 1963, when that corresponding section of I-24 was built. The interchange with I-24, known as the \"Big Scramble,\" was reworked in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the I-124 signage was removed at this time.\n\nA major reconstruction project commenced in December 2015 to widen and modernize I-124, which will reconstruct all interchanges, provide adequate shoulders and median divider, widen the route to six lanes, and remove the s-curve at the 4th street interchange.

The film is a fictional representation of behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running public radio show of the same name. The film received mostly positive reviews and was a moderate box office success on its small budget.\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast including Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Tommy Lee Jones, Woody Harrelson, Lily Tomlin, Garrison Keillor, Virginia Madsen, John C. Reilly, and Lindsay Lohan.\n\nIn Saint Paul, Minnesota, the long-running live radio variety show \"A Prairie Home Companion\" prepares for its final broadcast. The radio station's new parent company has scheduled the show's home, the storied Fitzgerald Theater, for demolition and dispatched \"the Axeman\" to judge whether or not to save the show.\n\nIn between musical acts, and under the watchful eye of PI Guy Noir (Kevin Kline), the show's denizens mingle and reminisce, including: the singing Johnson Girls, Yolanda (Meryl Streep), her sister Rhonda (Lily Tomlin), and daughter Lola (Lindsay Lohan); cowboy duo Dusty (Woody Harrelson) and Lefty (John C. Reilly); pregnant PA Molly (Maya Rudolph); the Stage Manager, Makeup Lady, and Sound Effects Man (real life Radio Acting Co. members Tim Russell, Sue Scott, and Tom Keith); and the show's creator and host, Garrison Keillor.\n\nThe show is visited by an otherworldly \"Dangerous Woman\" (Virginia Madsen), revealed to be a listener who died during a past broadcast, now returned as the angel Asphodel; she lends comfort to the cast and crew for the show's ending and the death of the elderly Chuck Akers (L. Q. Jones) backstage.\n\nThe Axeman (Tommy Lee Jones) arrives and declares the show too old-fashioned to keep on the air. Though Asphodel escorts him from the theater to an untimely demise, the show is still cancelled.\n\nYears later, the former cast reunites at Mickey's Diner with plans for a farewell tour. Their conversation pauses as they are joined by Asphodel.\n\nTo receive insurance for the shoot, Robert Altman had to hire Paul Thomas Anderson as a \"backup\" director to observe filming at all times and be prepared to take over for Altman in case of his incapacity. Using the working title \"The Last Show\", principal photography for the film began on June 29, 2005, at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota (the usual venue for the radio show). Filming ended on July 28, 2005.\n\n\"A Prairie Home Companion\" opened the 2006 South by Southwest film festival on March 10, then premiered in St. Paul, on May 3, 2006, at the Fitzgerald Theater, which had projection and sound equipment brought in for that purpose. The film's stars arrived in ten horse-drawn carriages. Brian Williams of \"NBC Nightly News\" anchored his newscast from neighboring Minneapolis, Minnesota, that night so that he would be able to attend.\n\nCritics' general reaction to the film was favorable. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 197 reviews, with an average rating of 7.12/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"The final film by the great Robert Altman, \"A Prairie Home Companion\", the big screen adaptation of Garrison Keillor's radio broadcast showcases plenty of the director's strengths: it's got a gigantic cast and plenty of quirky acting and dialogue.\" Roger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars, saying, \"What a lovely film this is, so gentle and whimsical, so simple and profound\", and later added the film to his \"Great Movies\" list.\n\nMichael Medved (himself a radio host) gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, \"The entertainment value stands somewhere between thin and nonexistent\" and \"[it may be] the worst movie ever made that pooled the talents of four (count ‘em – four!) Oscar winners\".\n\nDesson Thomson from \"The Washington Post\" fell in between, saying in a review headlined \"Honey, You Could Ask for More\" (a reference to the theme song of the radio show and film) that while the movie had its strengths, it was weaker than it should have been.\n\nMeryl Streep won the Best Supporting Actress Award from the National Society of Film Critics for her role; Altman was also posthumously nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Director.\n\nThe film had a successful limited release in the United States and grossed $20,338,609 domestically and $25,978,442 worldwide.\n\nA Prairie Home Companion is the soundtrack the 2006 film \"A Prairie Home Companion\".

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a United States Senator from Rhode Island from 1950 to 1976 and as the 61st governor of Rhode Island from 1945 to 1950. He was the first Italian American elected to the Senate.\n\nJohn Pastore was born in the Federal Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. The second of five children, he was the son of Michele and Erminia (née Asprinio) Pastore, who were Italian immigrants. His father, a tailor who had moved from Potenza to the United States in 1899, died when John was nine, and his mother went to work as a seamstress to support the family. She married her late husband's brother, Salvatore, who also ran a tailoring business. As a child, Pastore worked delivering coats and suits for his uncle/stepfather, as an errand boy in a law office, and as a foot-press operator in a jewelry factory.\n\nPastore graduated with honors from Classical High School in 1925, and spent a year working a $15-a-week job as a claims adjuster for the Narragansett Electric Company. In 1927, he enrolled in an evening law course given by Northeastern University at YMCA in Providence. He received a Bachelor of Laws degree (equivalent to a modern J.D. degree) in 1931, and was admitted to the bar the following year. He then established a law office in the basement of his family's home, but attracted few clients due to the Great Depression.\n\nIn 1934, Pastore was elected as a Democrat to the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He was re-elected in 1936, and became chairman of the House Corporations Committee. He served as an assistant attorney general from 1937 until 1938, when he lost that position after the Republican Party swept several statewide offices. He then served as a member of the Providence Charter Revision Commission from 1939 to 1940.\n\nWhen the Democratic Party returned to power in 1940, Pastore was appointed assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal calendar, serving in that position until 1944. In July 1941, he married Elena Caito, to whom he remained married until his death; the couple had one son and two daughters.\n\nPastore was elected Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island in 1944. On October 6, 1945, he succeeded to the office of Governor of Rhode Island when Governor J. Howard McGrath resigned to become U.S. Solicitor General under President Harry S. Truman. During his first year in office, he established a one-percent sales tax.\n\nIn 1946, Pastore was elected to a full term as governor after defeating his Republican opponent, John G. Murphy, by a margin of 54%-46%. With his victory, he became the first Italian American to be elected a governor in the United States; Charles Poletti, who served as Governor of New York in December 1942, also succeeded to office but never sought election in his own right. He was re-elected in 1948, defeating Warwick mayor Albert P. Ruerat by 61%-38%. During his tenure, he enacted the state's first primary election law and corporate income tax. He also created a program to combat water pollution and a $20 million bonus for World War II veterans. As chairman of the New England Governors' Conference, he called for a uniform nationwide unemployment insurance tax, either through \"federalization of the program or some form of federal reinsurance\".\nIn 1950 Pastore was elected to the United States Senate as a Democrat in a special election to succeed—once again, albeit for a different office—J. Howard McGrath, who had resigned in 1949 to become United States Attorney General (Edward L. Leahy held the office during a 16-month interim appointment). Pastore was reelected in 1952, 1958, 1964, and 1970.\n\nIn 1964 Pastore delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which nominated Lyndon B. Johnson for the presidency.\n\nPastore won his final senate race in 1970 by a 68%–32% margin over John McLaughlin, a Catholic priest who did not support the Vietnam War. McLaughlin, who later left the priesthood, became more famous as the host of the television program \"The McLaughlin Group\".\nPastore served as the chairman of United States Senate Subcommittee on Communications. He is probably best remembered for taking part in a 1969 hearing involving a $20 million grant for the funding of PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting proposed by former President Lyndon Johnson. President Richard Nixon wanted to cut the proposed funding to $10 million due to the demands of the Vietnam War, and Fred Rogers, host of \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\", appeared before the committee to argue for the full $20 million. In about six minutes of testimony, Rogers spoke of the need for social and emotional education that public television provided. Pastore was not familiar with Rogers's work, and was sometimes described as gruff and impatient, but he told Rogers that the testimony had given him goose bumps, and after Rogers recited the lyrics to \"What Do You Do with the Mad that You Feel?\", one of the songs from his show, Pastore declared: \"I think it's wonderful. I think it's wonderful. Looks like you just earned the $20 million.\" The following year's appropriation increased PBS funding from $9 million to $22 million.\n\nIn 1976 Pastore did not seek re-election retired from the Senate. In retirement he served on the board of directors of Providence based Columbus National Bank until its merger with Hospital Trust Bank in the late 1980s. \n\nHe lived in Cranston until his death due to kidney failure on July 15, 2000. \n\nPastore and his wife Elena had three children and eight grandchildren. His keynote speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention has been called \"The Speech Heard Round the World\". The late Ted Kennedy eulogized: \"My brother Jack had thought the world of him...John had a great heart.\" Pastore's private funeral service was held shortly after his death in 2000, in Cranston, Rhode Island.\n\nThe University of Rhode Island's Pastore Hall, completed in 1953, is named for Pastore. The building was initially home to the university's Department of Chemistry.\n"}

Ammons\n\nArchie Randolph Ammons (February 18, 1926 – February 25, 2001) was an American poet who won the annual National Book Award for Poetry in 1973 and 1993.\n\nAmmons wrote about humanity's relationship to nature in alternately comic and solemn tones. His poetry often addresses religious and philosophical matters and scenes involving nature, almost in a Transcendental fashion. According to reviewer Daniel Hoffman, his work \"is founded on an implied Emersonian division of experience into Nature and the Soul,\" adding that it \"sometimes consciously echo[es] familiar lines from Emerson, Whitman and Dickinson.\"\n\nAmmons grew up on a tobacco farm near Whiteville, North Carolina, in the southeastern part of the state. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, stationed on board the U.S.S. \"Gunason\", a battleship escort. After the war, Ammons attended Wake Forest University, majoring in biology. Graduating in 1949, he served as a principal and teacher at Hattaras Elementary School later that year and also married Phyllis Plumbo. He received an M.A. in English from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn 1964, Ammons joined the faculty of Cornell University, eventually becoming Goldwin Smith Professor of English and Poet in Residence. He retired from Cornell in 1998. His students who went on to achieve acclaim as poets include Alice Fulton and Jerald Bullis.\n\nAmmons had been a longtime resident of the South Jersey communities of Northfield, Ocean City and Millville, when he wrote \"Corsons Inlet\" in 1962.\n\nDuring the five decades of his poetic career, Ammons was the recipient of many awards and citations. Among his major honors are the 1973 and 1993 U.S. National Book Awards (for \"Collected Poems, 1951-1971\" and for \"Garbage\"); the Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets (1998); and a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981, the year the award was established. \n\nAmmons's other awards include a 1981 National Book Critics Circle Award for \"A Coast of Trees\"; a 1993 Library of Congress Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry for \"Garbage\"; the 1975 Bollingen Prize for \"Sphere\"; the Poetry Society of America's Robert Frost Medal; the Ruth Lilly Prize; and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.\n\nAmmons often writes in two- or three-line stanzas. Poet David Lehman notes a resemblance between Ammons's \"terza libre\" (unrhymed three-line stanzas) and the \"terza rima\" of Shelley's \"Ode to the West Wind.\" Lines are strongly enjambed.\n\nSome of Ammons's poems are very short, one or two lines only, a form known as monostich (effectively, including the title, a kind of couplet), while others (for example, the book-length poems \"Sphere\" and \"Tape for the Turn of the Year\") are hundreds of lines long, and sometimes composed on adding-machine tape or other continuous strips of paper. His National Book Award-winning volume \"Garbage\" is a long poem consisting of \"a single extended sentence, divided into eighteen sections, arranged in couplets\". Ammons's long poems tend to derive multiple strands from a single image.\n\nMany readers and critics have noted Ammons's idiosyncratic approach to punctuation. Lehman has written that Ammons \"bears out T. S. Eliot's observation that poetry is a 'system of punctuation'.\" Instead of periods, some poems end with an ellipsis; others have no terminal punctuation at all. The colon is an Ammons \"signature\"; he uses it \"as an all-purpose punctuation mark.\"\nAccording to critic Stephanie Burt, in many poems Ammons combines three types of diction:\n\nSuch a mixture is nearly unique, Burt says; these three modes are \"almost never found together outside his poems\".\n\nIn contrast, critic J. Mark Smith notes that in long poems such as \"Garbage\", with their \"improvised, no-stopping, 'one-time event' compositional procedures,\" \"Ammons works with a continuum of utterance whose central furrows are the most frequently repeated words and phrases in the contemporary American vulgate, but whose far outcastings register the faintest traces of anomalous use.\" That is, Ammons subjected his own poetic style and its relation to contemporary speech to considerable scrutiny. As Smith puts it, \"Ammons's premise is that the process of sorting and grouping (or abstracting) that produces what we commonly call 'garbage' also powers the appearances, disappearances, and re-appearances of words.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Graduating in 1986 as a senior, he led Rich Central to a second-place finish in the IHSA class AA state boys basketball tournament. Gill led his team in scoring with 54 points in the four games of the tournament finals, and was named to the six-player All-Tournament team.\n\nAfter high school, Gill attended the University of Illinois. Playing four years for the Fighting Illini, he was a starter in his last three seasons. As a junior, Gill led the Fighting Illini to the 1989 Final Four before losing to Michigan on a last-second shot. Also among that fabled \"\"Flyin' Illini\"\" squadron were future NBA players Nick Anderson, Marcus Liberty, Kenny Battle and Illini TV/radio broadcaster Stephen Bardo as well as four-year starter Lowell Hamilton. As a senior, Gill led the Big Ten in scoring and was named a first-team All-American (UPI). He left Illinois as the seventh-leading scorer in school history. Gill's Illini earned NCAA bids each year he played. He also won the NCAA Slam Dunk championship in the Final Four his senior season.\n\nGill was elected to the \"Illini Men's Basketball All-Century Team\" in 2004.\n\nGill was chosen in the 1990 NBA draft as the fifth overall pick by the Charlotte Hornets, and was named First Team All-Rookie for the 1990–91 season. During this same season, Gill participated in the NBA Slam-Dunk Competition. He had a tough time as a rookie trying to fit into the Hornets rotation, alongside already established back-court teammates Muggsy Bogues and Rex Chapman.\n\nAfter the 1991 addition of Larry Johnson and departure of Rex Chapman to the Washington Bullets, Gill had a breakthrough year in the 1991–92 season by averaging 20.5 points, 5.1 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game, while shooting 46.7% from the field.\n\nIn 1993, Gill helped the Hornets reach the NBA postseason for the first time in franchise history, however, he was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics during the following off-season. The SuperSonics, who also added Detlef Schrempf that same summer, put together a team led by Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp. Unfortunately for Gill and the SuperSonics, even with an all-star caliber team, they suffered two first round eliminations by the Denver Nuggets in 1994 and the Los Angeles Lakers in 1995. Gill would return to Charlotte for the 1995–96 season but in January of 1996, the Hornets dealt Gill and Khalid Reeves to the New Jersey Nets for Kenny Anderson, who became the team's starting point guard while Bogues sat out with a knee injury that only limited him to just six games for the entire season. Gill would suffer an injury that would limit him to only 11 games for the remainder of the season.\n\nFor the remainder of the 1990s Gill would play for the Nets, helping the team reach the 1998 playoffs and leading the league in steals in 1998–99. On April 3, 1999, Gill recorded 11 steals in a game against the Miami Heat, tying a single-game record set by Larry Kenon during the 1976–77 season. In this game, he also recorded 15 points and 10 rebounds for a rare points-rebounds-steals triple-double. Gill's final season in New Jersey, the 2000–01 season, was shortened by injury, allowing him to play in only 31 games during the season. \n\nIn his final four seasons in the NBA, Gill would play the 2001-02 season with the Miami Heat, the 2002–03 season with the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the 2003–04 season with the Chicago Bulls, before completing his career with the Milwaukee Bucks in 2004.\n\nIn his 15 seasons in the NBA, Gill played in 966 games for seven teams. He also appeared in 27 playoff games for four different teams. He was a member of the NBA All-Rookie Team in 1991 and went on to compile 12,914 points, 2,945 assists, and 4,002 rebounds during his career.\n\nGill was raised in Matteson, Illinois.\n\nAs a means to maintain his conditioning, Gill took up boxing, eventually entering the professional ranks. Gill had his first bout on June 25, 2005 at the age of 37.\n\nIn 1994, Gill made an appearance as himself in a Nickelodeon TV show \"My Brother and Me\". He appeared on the January 23, 2008 edition of Spike TV's \"Pros vs. Joes\".\n\nOn May 15, 2010, Gill sang a rendition of \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" at Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, as they took on the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nGill has provided analysis during pregame and postgame shows on Comcast SportsNet Chicago for Chicago Bulls games. On March 22, 2013, Gill was suspended by Comcast SportsNet for the remainder of the 2012–13 season after a reported physical altercation with analyst Tim Doyle in the Comcast SportsNet newsroom. In September 2013, Gill indicated that he was not returning to the station. However, he was rehired by Comcast SportsNet in late 2015.\n\nIn 2017, Gill was signed as a free agent in the BIG3 basketball league by Power to take the place of Corey Maggette after he suffered an injury during the season.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He began exploratory excavations on the mound at Hisarlik (the site of the ancient city of Troy), seven years before the arrival of Heinrich Schliemann.\n\nFrank was the youngest of seven children born to James Calvert (1778–1852), of Malta, and Louisa Ann Lander (1792–1867). Calvert was raised in Malta, at that time a British naval base. He was overshadowed by his elder siblings and became involved with the careers of his elder, more flamboyant brothers. He remained unmarried, and had an enduring passion for the Homeric epics and a firm belief that the myths were history, not fiction.\n\nAs early as 1822, Hisarlik was identified by Charles Maclaren as a possible site of Homeric Troy. In 1847, his brother Frederick bought a farm of over 2,000 acres (8 km²) at Akca Koy which included part of Mount Hisarlik. This was to be a momentous acquisition.\n\nFrank continued to support his brothers' careers. In 1855, while Frederick was completely engrossed in affairs related to the Crimean War, Frank continued to produce the bulk of official consular correspondence in French and English. On occasion in 1856 and 1858, Frank stood in for Frederick as acting British consul. After standing in for his brother James, Frank eventually succeeded him as United States consular agent in 1874, an unpaid position that he held for the rest of his life. Occasionally, he served on local mixed European and Turkish tribunals, assuming from time to time the title of acting British consul.\n\nApart from performing his consular duties, Calvert carried on careful, exploratory excavations on the family-owned land which incorporated the mound of Hisarlik. He was convinced that this was the site of the ancient city of Troy, but in 1908 he died and was never officially associated with the discovery of Troy. In a twist of fate, descendants of the Calvert brothers are now pursuing claims to the treasure recovered from Hisarlik.\n\nIn the field of archaeology, Calvert has been a mere shadow compared to his partner Heinrich Schliemann, who was later accused of manipulating and taking advantage of Calvert. Schliemann had a significantly larger budget than Calvert, and frequently used it to his advantage. Calvert was also shy about his educational experience because he was self-taught. At an early age he began visiting ancient sites, understanding different cultures and learning how they lived. In his teens he visited sites such as Corfu, Athens, Egypt, Brindisi and others, but he mostly stayed in the Troad, the region of Asia Minor believed to have been under Trojan rule.\n\nAt the time Schliemann began excavating in Turkey, the site commonly believed to be Troy was at Pınarbaşı, a hilltop at the south end of the Trojan Plain. Schliemann performed soundings at Pınarbaşı, but was disappointed by his findings. Schliemann did not know where to look for Troy and was about to give up his exploration altogether. It was not until Calvert suggested excavating the mound of Hissarlik that Schliemann made any moves to dig at the site. Calvert had already searched in the mound, but he never made it down to the Bronze Age layers; still, he was determined Troy was buried somewhere within the mound.\n\nSchliemann and Calvert found not only the possible site of Troy but thousands of artefacts such as diadems of woven gold, rings, bracelets, intricate earrings and necklaces, buttons, belts and brooches as well as anthropomorphic figures, bowls and vessels for perfumed oils.\n\nIn 1996 American and British heirs to Calvert sought ownership of a portion of the treasure found by Schliemann on Calvert's land (Calvert only owned half the mound).\n\nCalvert's work on Troy is mentioned in the 1985 BBC TV series \"In Search of the Trojan War\", written and presented by Michael Wood.\n\n\n"}

It first aired on Comedy Central April 23, 2003. \n\nIn the episode, Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny start a Junior Detective's Club and are soon recruited by the Park County police department, naming them \"junior deputies\". However, the boys soon find out that being real detectives isn't as fun as they thought.\n\nStan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny decide to play detective; they go around the town solving minor \"crimes\" for a dollar. They first investigate the disappearance of a pie left sitting on the windowsill of an elderly couple's home. After examining the scene of the crime, they come to the conclusion (based on no evidence at all) that the husband planned to murder and dismember his wife to have the pie for himself; however, before he could go through with the plan, the pie had already been eaten by their dog, where the boys found it. Horrified by their outrageous accusations, the couple hurriedly send them away, but not before giving them the dollar they had promised.\n\nThe boys' next case involves the recovery of a little girl's stolen doll. After suspecting Butters for no particular reason and having him produce a semen sample, they get a tip-off that Bill and Fosse have the doll. They manage to recover the doll from them, despite several kids playing FBI asserting jurisdictional privilege and trying to take over the boys' case.\n\nThe recovery gets the boys recognized by the Park County PD, and they are made Junior Detectives. However, it's not just honorary. Lieutenant Dawson, the department's head lieutenant, flat-out hires them and then assigns them to bust a meth lab, something that should be reserved for actual detectives. With the boys not knowing what a meth lab is, Stan knocks on the door of the lab and simply calls out, \"Uh, police. Open up.\" The criminals open fire at the boys, but just end up killing themselves, destroying the lab, and causing a great deal of property damage to the surrounding area.\n\nBecause of this incident, Dawson chews the boys out for 'getting careless'. Meanwhile, other detectives mock the boys, and it is revealed to them that many of the cops on the force are corrupt. The boys are then sent a strip club owned by Gino, the leader of Colorado's greatest drug cartel, who was behind the original meth lab. When they arrive, a bouncer takes them to Gino. When the cartel members notice that the boys are undercover cops, an intense shoot-out ensues, though the boys have nothing more than hands which they pretend are guns (while yelling \"bang bang\").\n\nThree cops show up to give the boys backup, but it turns out that two of them (named Murphy and Jenkins) are working with Gino. During the shoot-out, they shoot Hopkins, the one good cop who defended the boys earlier, in the arm, though he survives. They then turn on Gino and kill him, so that they can get all the money together. However, Murphy kills Jenkins, turns to the boys, announces that the only person he cannot trust is himself, and commits suicide.\n\nFinally, the boys are credited by Dawson with cleaning up the police force and are offered positions as full detectives. The boys, however, find reality more intense than their game, and decide to go back to playing laundromat instead. Butters later announces that he was finally able to produce a semen sample by imagining Stan's mom's breasts; however, because the boys are no longer playing detective anymore, they no longer want a semen sample, and thus, the entire ordeal is forgotten. Cartman, though, offers Butters to have his pants cleaned for $4.95.\n\nThe episode is a parody of crime drama shows like . On the DVD commentary, Trey Parker said that the episode is based on his childhood, where he had a desk and a rolodex in his parents basement and played Jr. detective.\n\n\"Lil' Crime Stoppers\", along with the fourteen other episodes from \"The Complete Seventh Season,\" were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on March 21, 2006. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. \"IGN\" gave the season an 8/10.\n\n"}

{"id": "2147602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147602", "title": "S.O.S. Titanic", "text": "S.O.S. Titanic\n\nS.O.S. Titanic is a British-American 1979 television movie that depicts the doomed 1912 maiden voyage from the perspective of three distinct groups of passengers in First, Second, and Third Class. The script was written by James Costigan and directed by William Hale (credited as Billy Hale). It is the first \"Titanic\" film filmed and released in color.\n\nFirst Class passengers include a May–December couple, multi-millionaire John Jacob Astor IV (David Janssen) and his new wife Madeleine Talmage Force (Beverly Ross); their friend, the \"unsinkable\" Molly Brown (Cloris Leachman); another pair of honeymooners, Daniel and Mary Marvin (Jerry Houser and Deborah Fallender); and Benjamin Guggenheim (John Moffatt), returning to his wife and children after a scandalous affair.\n\nOne plot line relates the tentative shipboard romance of two schoolteachers, \"Titanic\" survivor Lawrence Beesley (David Warner, later appearing in the James Cameron 1997 film \"Titanic\") and the fictional Leigh Goodwin (Susan Saint James). Both are saved.\n\nIn steerage, the plot focuses on the experiences of eight Irish immigrants, who are first depicted approaching the ship from a tender in the harbor of Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland. These characters, all based on real people, include Katie Gilnagh (played by Shevaun Bryers), Kate Mullens, Mary Agatha Glynn, Bridget Bradley, Daniel Buckley, Jim Farrell, Martin Gallagher, and David Chartens. During the voyage, Martin Gallagher falls for an unnamed \"Irish beauty.\"\n\nThe cast also includes Helen Mirren in a small role (as Mary Sloan, a real-life surviving Titanic Stewardess) early in her career.\n\nOne of the film's major themes is class distinctions. Second Class passengers Beesley and Goodwin discuss their ambiguous position \"in the middle\" and debate whether class distinctions are uniquely British. Goodwin briefly encourages Beesley to pursue his apparent attraction to a young Irish beauty in Third Class, but he rejects this advice. The Third Class passengers, mostly from poor backgrounds, do not show any resentment at their meager accommodation—Katie Gilnagh comments that sleeping four-to-a-room is far more comfortable than the situation she experienced in her overcrowded childhood home—but on the night of the sinking, they struggle to evade the efforts of ship's personnel to keep them below decks and away from the lifeboats. Led by Jim Farrell, they successfully sneak up to the First Class restaurant, where Farrell persuades the Master-at-Arms to allow the women—but only the women—to pass up to the boat deck.\n\nAnother major theme is the happy, hectic atmosphere aboard ship. Young Mary Marvin comments that many of the First Class passengers are honeymooners, and that she does not want to land, but simply to go on sailing and dancing forever. In much simpler surroundings, the Third Class passengers also engage in music, dancing, winning, and whirlwind romances. Meanwhile, Beesley and Goodwin toy with the possibility of embarking on an illicit affair in an empty cabin but decide not to. Goodwin comments that shipboard romances, like shipboard friendships, are meant to end with the voyage.\n\nA third theme is who deserved, or accepted, responsibility for the wrecking of the RMS \"Titanic\". Captain Edward Smith, a veteran White Star captain nearing retirement, is depicted as a masterful leader who nevertheless failed to slow down in spite of being well aware that he was traveling into ice-laden waters. Shipbuilder Thomas Andrews radiates an almost saintly quality, seeing to the final details of construction and repairs himself, tenderly looking after passengers and crew, and even conversing with a young stewardess about their common hometown of Belfast. He fully understands the implications of the collision, and his knowledge that he cannot save the ship clearly breaks his heart. Meanwhile, White Star Line director J. Bruce Ismay wavers between a stance of command and an unwillingness to take responsibility for the sinking. Identifying himself as a passenger, he defiantly boards a lifeboat, only to experience a nervous breakdown later aboard the \"R.M.S. Carpathia\" rescuing ship. Ismay is the only one of these three men who survives, and it is clear that he will never fully recover from the psychological effects and blow to his reputation from the fabled sinking.\n\nThe film includes roles on RMS Carpathia (particularly the radio operator, Harold Cottam) and shows this ship more fully than other film versions. It shows survivors going onto the Carpathia. The seascape is shown heavy with ice floes.\n\nRather than the traditional Nearer My God to Thee the ship band plays jaunty ragtime tunes by Scott Joplin.\n\nSurvivors discuss the silence of the disappearance of the ship and absence of screaming. Several philosophise regarding their losses.\n\n\nThe film was greenlit by Bernard Delfont of EMI Films, at the same time as Delfont's brother, Sir Lew Grade, was making a film based on \"Raise the Titanic\".\n\nProducer William Filmore called it the \"thinking man's disaster film\".\n\nSeveral of the scenes on the exterior decks, as well as those in the ship's wheelhouse, were filmed on board the later British ocean liner from the 1930s, the retired RMS \"Queen Mary\" in Long Beach, California.\n\nSome interior scenes were filmed at the Waldorf and Adelphi historic hotels in London and Liverpool, respectively. The town of Peel on the Isle of Man served as the Queenstown backdrop. Some external shots were filmed aboard, and of, the TSS \"Manxman\" which also appears as the \"R.M.S. Carpathia\" in some of the opening sequences and as the \"R.M.S. Titanic\" in a few shipboard scenes.\n\n\n"}

During its run it was hosted by Dave Aizer, Jonah Travick and Jessica Holmes and produced/directed by Jason Harper. It was located outside (inside if either weather did not permit, or the outdoor area had become too messy from earlier in the day) of the former Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios Florida (the third-to-last show to do so). It mainly aired as filler during regular commercial time.\n\nThe show holds two Guinness World Records – most people pied in three minutes (1000, in 2001), and most people slimed (762, on the finale). The sliming was done outdoors, in front of the studios.\n\nThe show was known to have slimed their audience; when they did this they would pick someone, sit them in a chair, and ask them a question. If they answered correctly, they would get a bucket of slime (eventually changed to two buckets, then three) poured on top of them.\n\nThe show was also known to have their audience members, contestants, hosts (notably Jessica), celebrity guests, and staff caught on-camera pied in the face. When it was cancelled, Nick's pieing trademark was forgotten. It was later revived through the Nick-themed resort and cruise line.\n\nDuring the show, viewers would phone in to play interactive games with players on the show. The most common game was to make a match of Nicktoons from off of a Tic-tac-toe grid. The board was scrambled before game play and if a match was made, the home player would win a prize and the contestant would be slimed and often pied as well. If they did not make a match, host Dave Aizer would receive a pie in the face. Later when the mystery bucket was introduced, if no match was made, only the mystery bucket would drop on the player. In addition to Nicktoons, the board included a pie tile (the contestant would shove the pie they are holding in their face), a \"cream blaster\" tile (where the contestant would be blasted with whipped-cream by the two side cannons), a bonus tile (where the home player gets another try) and an \"instant slime\" tile or a wild card (which triggered an automatic match, an instant sliming & an instant win). On some occasions, an overload of slime is used.\n\nMore interactive games would be played as the run progressed. Many celebrities from other Nick shows appeared often.\n\nFirst known as \"Super Sloppy Slime-Off,\" The Big Shaboozie was the show's end game. Below are changes made, over the years, to it while the show was on-air.\n\nIn \"Super Sloppy Slime-Off,\" two out of three teams (each team had three contestants), Jessica led one team and Jonah led the other, would stand under a trough filled with slime. Dave would ask a Nick-related question, if one of the in-house players answered the question, one of the contestants from the home player's team would be pied by their team leader; if they answered wrong, a contestant from the opposing team would be pied by their team leader. The team to have all three of their members pied would be slimed and (along with the home player) receive a grand prize.\n\nRenamed \"The Big Shaboozie,\" changes to the game included Dave asking Nick-related questions on the given topic (instead of random questions); all players would now wear goggles during the game—whether it was getting pied, slimed, etc. -- in addition to getting slimed (they often got slimed with other substances besides that), the members of the winning team would be blasted (front and back) with whipped cream.\n\n\nThis time, there are only two players on each team. Each team takes turns deciding which number to pick on a Tic-tac-Toe board; if one team finds \"The Big Shaboozie\" they will win the game, but if they find \"The Whammy,\" the opposing team wins.\n\n\n\nFor the final season, the show began recording prior to the days it was set to air, and aired in the morning hours. Nickelodeon had tried to gain young viewers in that time through this, but ratings declined shortly thereafter. The show would often \"connect\" (Florida to New York) with \"U-Pick Live\", which would replace it later in the year.\n\nOn the grand finale, the show broke the world record for most people slimed at one time.\n\nA few years after the show's cancellation, \"Friday Night Slimetime\" premiered on Nickelodeon, but unlike the original version, its segments were prerecorded. It lasted for two back to back seasons and was hosted by Lil' JJ and Chloe Dolandis (who had previously hosted Splat! on Nickelodeon). Nickelodeon had a talent hold on Lil' JJ and was forced to give him a show to finish out his contract. Because of this, Dave Aizer was brought on board as a writer and also occasionally announced the prizes. The most common prizes on it were either a bicycle or athletic balls. This ran from September 23, 2005 to March 24, 2006.\n\n"}
