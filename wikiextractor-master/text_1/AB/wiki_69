This may involve a statutory offer to compromise in a civil lawsuit. In either case, it involves communication from one party to the other suggesting a settlement, or an agreement to fully and finally resolve the outstanding issue, account, or dispute.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, offers to settle are governed by Part 36 of the Civil Procedure Rules.\n\nOffers of settlement may be called \"Calderbank Offers\", \"Calderbank Letters\" and \"Offers of Compromise\".\n\nIn the US, evidence of settlement discussions generally, and of settlement offers specifically, is generally inadmissible in court. This is a policy-based exclusion, intended to encourage the settlement of cases out of court, thus freeing up the resources of the court system. In many jurisdictions, written agreement between the litigants may become binding agreements pursuant to the rules of procedure.\n\nIn Arizona, the Rules of Civil Procedure 80 governs binding settlement agreements in civil court and rule 69 of the Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure governs binding agreements in family court.\n\nIn Connecticut an offer of compromise is governed by Connecticut General Statute 52-192a. An offer of compromise is a pleading that gets filed with a court to settle a case for a specific amount of money. If the opposing party accepts the offer the case is over. An offer of compromise can first be filed 180 days after the date of service in standard negligence cases and 365 days in medical malpractice cases. An offer of compromise can add a significant amount of money to a case. Interest runs at a rate of 8% over the offer amount and relate back to the date the lawsuit was filed.\n\nIn the US state of Florida the offer of a judgment and demand for judgment in negligence-based torts are governed by Title XLV (Torts) Chapter 768 (Negligence): 768.79  \"Offer of judgment and demand for judgment\". It is also governed by rule 1.442 of the Florida Rules for Civil Procedure \"Proposals for Settlement\". This process involves making an offer by either party and how the judgment amount affects whether legal fees and costs will be awarded.\n\nLike the United Kingdom, Australia may call settlement offers Calderbank offers, or offers of compromise, pursuant to rule 20.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules.\n\nA Calderbank offer can be made in writing or orally. Oral offers may create evidentiary issues such that less weight is given to the offer. An effective offer can be made before action. Calderbank Offers and Calderbank Letters often have a major impact on the allocation, by courts, of legal costs between parties.\n\n"}

She has since recorded seven studio albums and scored two number one singles, \"Cassé\" and \"Nolwenn Ohwo!\", on the French charts. In 2012, her album \"Bretonne\" was certified two times diamond for sales exceeding one million copies.\n\nLeroy is fluent in English, having spent a year in the US as an exchange student. She sings in many languages, including French, Breton, English and Irish. She has also performed in Italian and Spanish.\n\nLeroy has received numerous awards and nominations. In January 2015, she was ranked 17th on \"Le Journal du Dimanche\"'s 50 Most Loved Celebrities in France, making her the top female singer on the list since December 2012.\n\nLeroy's parents left Saint-Renan (Finistère) when she was four years old. After living in Paris, Lille, and Guingamp, her mother, Muriel Leroy, and her younger sister, Kay, settled with Leroy's grandparents in Saint-Yorre. Her mother divorced from her father, professional footballer Jean-Luc Le Magueresse, in 1993.\n\nNolwenn studied at the \"\"Collège des Célestins\"\" in Vichy. When Leroy was eleven, her music teacher noticed her musical talents and encouraged her to learn the violin. At the age of thirteen she won \"\"Les écoles du désert\"\", a contest sponsored by the Cora supermarket chain, which allowed her to travel with a humanitarian mission from Gao to Timbuktu, Mali; she later claimed this had a profound influence on her.\n\nIn July 1998, Leroy was awarded a scholarship by the Vichy Rotary Club to travel to Hamilton, Ohio, United States, as an exchange student. While attending Hamilton High School, she took music lessons at the Performing Arts School and became fluent in English during her stay there. When she returned to France, she began classical singing classes at the Vichy music conservatory. In 2001, she enrolled in the University of Clermont-Ferrand to study law for a potential alternative career to music.\n\nAfter watching the first series of \"Star Academy\" broadcast on TF1 in 2001, Leroy was impressed by Armande Altaï, a singing teacher and one of the show's judges, and decided to join Altaï's singing classes in Paris for over six months. In 2002, Nolwenn was selected for the second season of the show, but she was also given the part of Scarlett O'Hara in the French stage musical \"Autant en emporte le vent\" (\"Gone with the Wind\") by Gérard Presgurvic. Leroy finally chose the television singing competition over the musical and joined the Dammarie-lès-Lys castle in late August 2002, where she followed acting, dancing and singing classes for four months. She was declared the overall winner, ahead of her fellow finalist, Houcine Camara, on 21 December 2002.\n\nLeroy's first album, \"Nolwenn\", was released in March 2003 and was certified platinum by November for sales exceeding 300,000 copies. In 2006, the album was certified two times platinum by the Syndicat national de l'édition phonographique (SNEP) for more than 600,000 copies sold. Both the album and the hit single \"Cassé\" topped the charts in France and Belgium. Three further songs from the album were released as singles: \"Une Femme cachée\", \"Suivre une étoile\" and \"Inévitablement\". Leroy went on tour in France, Belgium and Switzerland in late 2003 to promote songs from the album.\n\nLeroy's second album, \"Histoires Naturelles\", was released on 5 December 2005. It was produced by Laurent Voulzy and Frank Eulry. The album's lead single \"Nolwenn Ohwo!\", co-written by Alain Souchon, Voulzy and Leroy herself, topped the French charts. The second single was the title track, \"Histoire Naturelle\". Music videos were made for both songs; the video for \"Histoire Naturelle\" expressed the main theme of the album with Leroy being portrayed as natural history museum exhibits. Of the other single releases, \"Mon Ange\" was distributed digitally while \"J'aimais tant l'aimer\" and \"Reste Encore\" were promotional-only. The album reached platinum status with 400,000 copies sold. Songs from \"Histoires Naturelles\" and \"Nolwenn\" were performed on Leroy's second tour entitled \"Histoires Naturelles Tour\", which started in September 2006. It was followed by a Summer Tour in 2007. Leroy's first live album was subsequently released in late October 2007.\n\n\"Le Cheshire Cat & Moi\" was a project that began in 2007, co-written by Leroy and Teitur Lassen, with contributions from Jonatha Brooke, Michelle Featherstone, Mike Errico and Rupert Hine. It was arranged and produced by Lassen, and recorded in Sweden and the Faroe Islands. The album's lead single, \"Faut-il, faut-il pas ?\", was released in November 2009 along with a music video directed by Yoann Lemoine. Leroy was observed to feature \"a lighter sound than on previous releases\" and the album gave the opportunity for her to write all the lyrics. The album was released on 7 December 2009 and was later certified gold. A tour entitled \"Le Cheshire Cat & Vous\" to promote the record was held in 2010.\n\nLeroy released a fourth studio album, \"Bretonne\", on 6 December 2010. Cover versions of traditional Celtic songs such as \"Mná na h-Éireann\", \"Tri Martolod\", \"La Jument de Michao\", and contemporary songs such as Christophe Miossec's \"Brest\" were included on the album. Most of the songs related to Brittany, the singer's birthplace, four sung in Breton (\"Tri Martolod\", \"Suite Sudarmoricaine\", \"Bro Gozh ma Zadoù\", \"Karantez Vro\"), one in Irish (\"Mná na h-Éireann\"), and the others in French and English. Leroy collaborated with Jon Kelly for the musical arrangements. The album topped the French album charts for 7 weeks and the Belgian album charts for 5 weeks. It was certified double diamond by the SNEP for sales exceeding one million copies.\n\nThe album was re-released in November 2011 as a \"Deluxe Edition\" which added 7 English language tracks, including \"Amazing Grace\", \"Scarborough Fair\" and two Mike Oldfield tracks, \"Moonlight Shadow\" and \"To France\". The American version of the album, retitled \"Nolwenn\", was released on 8 January 2013 with a different track listing. The album peaked at number 10 on the \"Billboard\"'s World Album chart. Leroy made her New York City debut at Drom.\n\nAs part of the Bretonne Tour, Leroy played over 100 dates in France, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. In June 2012, she performed as a special guest with The Chieftains in Paris.\n\nLeroy's fifth album, \"Ô Filles de l'eau\", was released on 26 November 2012, preceded by the lead single \"Juste pour me souvenir\". The album was produced by Jon Kelly and recorded in London. The title reads 'O Daughters of the Water' but is phonetically similar to 'au fil de l'eau' ('with the current/flow'). Like \"Bretonne\", it contains Celtic inspired music but with more ocean themed lyrics. It includes two tracks in English (\"Homeland\" and \"Limitless\"). \"Homeland\" contains the James Horner composed theme of the film \"Braveheart\". \"Ahès\" is the only Breton-language song of the album. Leroy wrote and co-composed 9 songs, including the singles \"Juste pour me souvenir\", \"Sixième continent\", \"J'ai volé le lit de la mer\" and \"Ophélia\". The album cover was created by Australian artist Vee Speers, inspired by her portrait series, \"Immortal\". Reviews of the album were strong, with some praising Leroy's vocal ability and Celtic music and lyrics, noting that her singing in English and Breton was brave and proved her to be an evolving artist, with strong sales to match. Two months after its release, the album was certified triple platinum by the SNEP. Furthermore, it was named RTL's Album of the Year 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Leroy toured France, Belgium and Switzerland in support of the album. Additionally, she was a special guest soloist on Vladimir Cosma's symphonic tour in France. In early 2014, she was nominated at the World Music Awards for the first time, in four categories: World's Best Album (\"Bretonne\"), World's Best Entertainer, World's Best Female Artist, and World's Best Live Act.\n\nIn 2014, she provided several songs in English and French for the Academy Awards-nominated animated film \"Song of the Sea\", and voiced the character of Bronagh in the film's French version.\nOn 3 May 2014, Leroy performed the Breton anthem \"Bro Gozh ma Zadoù\" at the Stade de France before 80,000 spectators, for the 2014 Coupe de France Final (aired on France 2) opposing two Breton clubs, the Stade Rennais to EA Guingamp.\n\nLeroy's second live CD/DVD, \"Ô Tour de L'Eau\", recorded in Saint-Brieuc, was released on 1 December 2014. In March 2015, she embarked on an acoustic tour in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\nOn 11 June 2015, she was invited to talk about her career at Oxford University. In November 2015, Leroy announced that she would perform at Celtic Connections in Glasgow's City Halls on 30 January 2016, along with Karen Matheson.\n\nOn 13 May 2017, she released \"Gemme\", the first single from her sixth studio album \"Gemme\" (English: \"Gem\"), produced in London by Jamie Ellis. The album was released on 1 September 2017. Leroy wrote and co-composed most of the songs. The album features three songs in English: \"Run It Down\" and two poems by Edgar Allan Poe set to music (\"A Dream\" and \"The Lake\"). The other songs are in French. \"Stephen\" refers to a theory by Stephen Hawking. A Limited Edition was released on 8 December 2017, including two remixes and two acoustic versions. In March 2018, Leroy embarked on the 55-date Gemme Tour through France, Belgium and Switzerland.\n\nLeroy's music was studied for its neurological impact in geriatric populations. Researchers found that Leroy's recordings might have a more beneficial effect than other music, noting that: \"the music of Nolwenn Leroy was found to be significantly superior to other music tested\". To describe the phenomenon they coined the term \"the Nolwenn Effect\", saying: \"the music of Nolwenn Leroy appears to have a different effect on brain-based modulation of gait and stance than other music tested to date\".\n\nMozart and Dutch and French singers were tested; only Mozart and Leroy's music were specified. The U.S. study was completed in February 2008, but no substantial results appear to be published.\n\nIn 2011, Leroy appeared in two television commercials for the Nintendo 3DS and she became the face of Pantene for France and Belgium.\n\nIn 2006, she joined the Les Enfoirés charity ensemble and she became one of the Abbé Pierre Foundation's patrons for housing people in need.\n\nOn 27 November 2015, she participated together with Camélia Jordana and Yael Naim at the national memorial day for the victims of the November 2015 Paris attacks singing the song \"Quand on n'a que l'amour\" from Jacques Brel.\n\nSince 2008 she has been in a relationship with Arnaud Clément, former French professional tennis player and captain of the France Davis Cup team.\n\n\n\nLeroy owns a horse named El Aberkan. She showed her horse riding and jumping skills on unfamiliar horses a couple of times for French TV shows broadcast on France 2, including the 50th Gala de l'Union des Artistes charity in 2011, alongside Alexis Gruss.\n\nThe main belt asteroid 353232 Nolwenn was named after Leroy.\n\nIn 2012, her wax figure was unveiled at the Musée Grévin in Paris.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2002860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002860", "title": "Portugal Day", "text": "Portugal Day\n\nPortugal Day, officially Day of Portugal, Camões, and the Portuguese Communities (), is the National Day of Portugal celebrated annually on 10 June. It is one of the public holidays in Portugal and celebrated by Portuguese people throughout the world. It commemorates the death on 10 June 1580 of Luís de Camões, a poet and national literary icon.\n\nCamões wrote \"Os Lusíadas\" (usually translated as \"The Lusiads\"), Portugal's national epic poem celebrating Portuguese history and achievements. The poem focuses mainly on the 15th-century Portuguese explorations, which brought fame and fortune to the country. The poem, considered one of the finest and most important works in Portuguese literature, became a symbol for the great feats of the Portuguese Empire.\n\nCamões was an adventurer who lost one eye fighting in Ceuta, wrote the poem while traveling, and survived a shipwreck in Cochinchina (a region of present-day Vietnam). According to popular folklore, Camões saved his epic poem by swimming with one arm while keeping the other arm above water. Since his date of birth is unknown, his date of death is celebrated as Portugal's National Day.\n\nAlthough Camões became a symbol for Portugal nationalism, his death coincided with the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580 that eventually resulted in Philip II of Spain claiming the Portuguese throne. Portugal was then ruled by three generations of Spanish kings during the Iberian Union (1580–1640). On 1 December 1640, the country regained its independence once again by expelling the Spanish during the Portuguese Restoration War and making John of Bragança, King John IV of Portugal.\n\nDuring the authoritarian Estado Novo regime in the 20th century, Camões was used as a symbol for the Portuguese nation. In 1944, at the dedication ceremony of the National Stadium in Oeiras (near Lisbon), President of the Council of Ministers (actually referred to as Prime Minister) António de Oliveira Salazar referred to 10 June as \"Dia da Raça\" (Day of the Portuguese Race). The notion of a Portuguese \"race\" served his nationalist purposes.\n\nPortugal Day celebrations were officially suspended during the Carnation Revolution in 1974. Celebrations resumed after 1974 and were expanded to include the \"Comunidades Portuguesas\", Portuguese emigrants and their descendants living in communities all around the world.\n\nThe celebrations involve various military ceremonies, exhibitions, concerts, pageants and parades, and an awards ceremony by the President of the Portuguese Republic. Every year, the President chooses a city to host the official celebrations.\n\nIn 2013 the official celebrations took place in the town of Elvas, the second time since 1997. One reason that Elvas had been chosen was that it had been classified in 2012 as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and is one of the most important cities in Portugal at the military level and the most fortified city in Europe.\n\nIn 2016 for the first time the official ceremonies were divided between the Portugueze capital of Lisbon and the French capital of Paris, by the initiative of president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa as a reminder that it is also the day of the Portuguese communities throughout the world.\n\nOn 8 November 2017, the House of Commons unanimously passed Davenport M.P. Julie Dzerowicz’s Private Member’s Bill M-126, declaring June as Portuguese Heritage Month and 10 June as Portugal Day in Canada. M-126 recognizes the contributions that Portuguese-Canadians have made to Canada and the importance of educating and reflecting upon Portuguese heritage and culture for future generations. This now opens these occasions to being recognized and celebrated at a national level instead of only by municipalities or provinces.\n\nIn Toronto, Ontario, over 200,000 Portuguese-Canadians celebrate by holding a multitude of events surrounding the 10 June date. The week-long festival culminates with the Portugal Day Parade on Dundas Street, in the area known as Little Portugal. The parade ends near Trinity Bellwoods Park, where concerts, cultural events and various other activities take place. The Portugal Day Parade is Toronto's third-largest street festival and first celebrated in 1966.\n\nIn London, England, Portuguese Britons celebrate the holiday annually as part of the UK Day of Portugal events. In 2009, festivities were held on 21 June in Streatham Common Park. In 2010 and 2011, festivities were celebrated on 13 June and 12 June, respectively, in Kennington Park, southeast London, in the area known as Little Portugal.\n\nThe 2012 observance was held on 10 June in Kennington Park. The officials and athletes representing Portugal at the 2012 Summer Olympics were based in Little Portugal near Kennington Park, and attended Portugal Day 2012 in Kennington Park.\n\nIn 2014 the event was not held, but was held in 2015 on Sunday 14 June in Streatham Common Park and this was the first time that a fee was charged to enter.\nThe event in 2016 was also planned to be a paid event on Sunday 12 June in Streatham Common Park, but was cancelled due to heavy rain.\n\nPortuguese Americans celebrate the holiday throughout the country, especially in Portuguese American neighborhoods, including in:\n\n\n"}

His parents divorced and his mother was later married to Joseph Goebbels. After World War II, Quandt and his older half-brother Herbert Quandt ran the industrial empire that was left to them by their father and that continues today, the family owning a stake in Germany's luxury car manufacturer BMW.\n\nHarald Quandt was born in Charlottenburg, the son of industrialist Günther Quandt and Magdalena Behrend Rietschel who had married in 1921. Although the couple divorced in 1929, they remained on friendly terms. Magda later married Joseph Goebbels at a property owned by Günther Quandt. Adolf Hitler was Goebbels' best man.\n\nAfter his mother's remarriage, Quandt remained with his father, who became a prominent business leader in Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, he paid regular visits to his mother, who had become \"the First Lady of the Third Reich\", and to his stepfather, who was minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda from 1933. After 1934, he returned to his mother and lived with the Goebbels family until passing his school-leaving examination in 1940. Residing with his adopted family, he raised several eyebrows by supporting the sloganeering of the Indian politician Subhash Chandra Bose.\n\nHe served as a lieutenant in the Luftwaffe during World War II. He took part in the Battle of Crete in 1941 and later fought in Russia and Italy, where he was injured. In 1944, he was captured by Allied troops in Italy; he was released in 1947. Magda and Joseph Goebbels committed suicide after killing their six children on 1 May 1945. Harald was the only one of Magda's children to survive.\n\nQuandt married Inge Bandekow (1928–1978), who was the daughter of the company's lawyer and worked as a secretary with her father, at the beginning of the 1950s. In the following 17 years, the couple had five daughters: Katarina Geller (1951), Gabriele Quandt-Langenscheidt (1952), Anette May-Thies (1954), Colleen-Bettina Rosenblat-Mo (1962) and Patricia Halterman (1967–2005). However, Quandt had the reputation of being a “committed playboy\".\n\nAfter returning to Germany, he first assisted his half-brother in re-building the family firms, and then from 1949 to 1953 studied mechanical engineering in Hanover and Stuttgart, where his family owned large firms (AFA/VARTA in Hanover, a private equity firm in Stuttgart).\n\nHis father died in 1954, leaving his empire jointly to Herbert and Harald, and making Harald one of the wealthiest men in West Germany. By then, the Quandt group consisted of more than 200 companies, ranging from the original textile businesses to pharmaceutical company Altana AG. The family holdings also included large stakes in the German auto industry with nearly 10% of Daimler-Benz and 30% of BMW. Although Herbert and Harald jointly managed the companies, Herbert focused on AFA/VARTA and the automotive investments, while Harald was in charge of IWKA and the engineering and tooling companies. Harald was an enthusiast of the amphibious vehicle known as the Amphicar that was manufactured by IWKA. His death was a factor in the ceasing of production of the Amphicar.\n\nHe survived an aviation accident at Zurich International Airport on 12 November 1965, but he was killed when another of his aircraft crashed in Cuneo, Italy, on 22 September 1967.\n\nHarald Quandt's five daughters inherited about 1.5 billion deutsche marks ($760 million, €585 million) and later increased their wealth through the Harald Quandt Holding GmbH, a German-based family investment company and trust named after their father. Today, they share a fortune worth at least $6 billion.\n\nThe Hanns-Joachim-Friedrichs-Award winning documentary film \"The Silence of the Quandts\" by the German public broadcaster ARD described in October 2007 the role of the Quandt family businesses during the Second World War. The family's Nazi past was previously not well known, and the documentary film revealed it to a wide audience and confronted the Quandts about the use of slave labourers in the family's factories during World War II. As a result, five days after the showing, four family members announced, on behalf of the entire Quandt family, their intention to fund a research project in which a historian will examine the family's activities during Adolf Hitler's dictatorship. The independent 1,200-page study released in 2011 concluded that, \"The Quandts were linked inseparably with the crimes of the Nazis,\" according to Joachim Scholtyseck, the historian who compiled and researched the study.\n\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

It is situated in the southeastern corner of the Brecon Beacons National Park. The summit plateau reaches a height of .\n\nBlorenge overlooks the market town of Abergavenny and the villages of Llanfoist and Govilon in the Usk Valley to the north. At the foot of the mountain lies the Monmouthshire & Brecon Canal. It drops away steeply to the northwest into Cwm Llanwenarth. To the south, gentler slopes fall away to Blaenavon at the head of the Lwyd valley. Prominent peaks seen from the Blorenge include the Skirrid to the east of Abergavenny and the Sugar Loaf to the north. The high moorland ridge continues to the south of the minor road at Foxhunter car park and assumes the name Mynydd y Garn-fawr. The cairn referenced in the title of this southerly shoulder of Blorenge may be that now known as Carn y Defaid which sits on the county boundary at a height of 503m. It is the most prominent amongst a handful of Bronze Age burial cairns.\n\nBlorenge is composed in layer-cake fashion of a number of rock types. Its lower slopes are formed from the sandstones and mudstones deposited during the Devonian period and known collectively as the Old Red Sandstone. Its higher reaches are formed from a suite of mudstones, limestones and sandstones of Carboniferous age. The summit plateau is formed from coarse sandstones that lie at the boundary of the Millstone Grit and the Coal Measures. All of these beds tilt south-westwards into the South Wales Coalfield basin.\n\nThe shape of the hill was modified during the ice ages as the Usk Valley glacier flowed past it to its north. A small glacier nourished by windblown snow from the plateau excavated the hollow on the eastern side of Blorenge which is known as The Punchbowl. Cwm Craf on the hill's north-eastern slopes has a cirque-like form though probably never harboured a full-grown glacier. Small landslips affect Blorenge's slopes, the most well-known of which is the Tumble through which the B4246 climbs towards Keeper's Pond.\nBlorenge is situated within both the Brecon Beacons National Park and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape, a World Heritage Site. Much of the hill has also been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest principally for its heather moorland which is important for breeding red grouse. The Punchbowl is owned and managed by the Woodland Trust as a nature reserve.\n\nMost of the hill is open access for walkers and there are a number of footpaths and bridleways which run to and over it. There is a hillwalking trail that runs around Blorenge and is a very popular destination for tourists and walkers alike. The ascent on foot to the summit from Llanfoist / Abergavenny via Cwm Craf is very steep but the effort is repaid by the panoramic views from the summit across the valley of the River Usk to Abergavenny and the Black Mountains, Wales. Easier access both to the summit and the northern edge of the plateau can be had from the Foxhunter car park.\n\nMost visitors are walkers and sightseers. Some come to see the grave of Sir Harry Llewellyn's famous showjumping horse, Foxhunter, who won Britain's only Gold medal in the 1952 Summer Olympics. Foxhunter is buried near to the Blaenavon to Llanover road on Blorenge. A car park here is named in his honour.\n\nThe SE Wales Hang Gliding & Paragliding Club's members regularly take off from the summit, The whole 998 acres of the upper part is owned by the club.

The fourth verse starts \"The purple headed mountain, the river running by\". \"The purple headed mountain\" is believed to be Blorenge, \"The river running by\" the Usk beneath.\n\n\"Blorenge\" is one of very few words in the English language which is a perfect rhyme for \"orange.\"\n\nThe western edge of Blorenge is crossed by the B4246 road between Llanfoist and Blaenavon which passes over the climb known as \"The Tumble\" (\"Y Tymbol\"), which reaches an elevation of close to Keepers Pond (Pen-ffordd-goch Pond) (at ).

{"id": "2002895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002895", "title": "Disclosure (novel)", "text": "Disclosure (novel)\n\nDisclosure is a novel by Michael Crichton and published in 1994. The novel is set at a fictional computer hardware manufacturing company in the mid-1990s. The plot concerns protagonist Tom Sanders and his struggle to prove that he was sexually harassed by his female employer.\n\nTom Sanders, the head of advanced products manufacturing at DigiCom, expects to be promoted to run the advanced products division after DigiCom's merger with a publishing house. Instead, the promotion is given to his ex-girlfriend, Meredith Johnson, who recently moved to Seattle from the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California.\n\nLater that day, Meredith calls Tom into her office, ostensibly to discuss an advanced CD-ROM drive. She aggressively tries to resume their relationship, despite Tom's repeated attempts to resist. When he spurns her sexual advances, Meredith angrily vows to make him pay.\n\nThe next morning, Tom discovers that Meredith has retaliated by falsely accusing him of sexual harassment. DigiCom president Bob Garvin, fearing that the incident could jeopardize the merger, tells the company's general counsel, Phil Blackburn, to propose transferring Tom to the company's Austin facility. However, Tom's division is due to be spun off as a publicly traded company after the merger, and if he's transferred, he will lose stock options which would make him a wealthy man. In addition, Tom's coworkers treat him with animosity, as they have believed Meredith's story.\n\nSeemingly out of options, Tom gets in touch with Seattle attorney Louise Fernandez, who agrees to take the case. Tom threatens to sue Meredith and DigiCom for sexual harassment unless Meredith is fired, throwing the merger and his future with the company in jeopardy. During a mediation, Tom discovers that when he called one of his colleagues, John Levin, about the problems with the drive, John's answering machine recorded the whole incident with Meredith. He and Louise also discover that DigiCom officials have known for some time that Meredith has a history of unwelcome advances toward male coworkers, and yet did nothing to stop it. Confronted with this evidence, DigiCom is forced to agree to a settlement in which Meredith is quietly pushed out and Tom is restored to his former post.\n\nThat night, Tom gets an email from \"A Friend\" warning him that all is not normal yet. Later, he overhears Meredith and Phil planning to make it look like Tom is responsible for defects in the CD-ROM project, thereby giving DigiCom an excuse to fire him for incompetence. Tom is initially unable to access the company database to prove his innocence, since Meredith has revoked his authorization. He circumvents the block through a prototype of the company's virtual reality machine that visualizes data. Tom discovers that Meredith changed the quality control specifications at the Malaysian plant manufacturing the drive. These changes, ostensibly to appease Malaysian government demands and cut costs, resulted in the defects. With the help of one of his Malaysian colleagues, Tom obtains enough evidence to turn the tables on Meredith and Phil, resulting in them getting fired instead. However, the merger does not go through, Tom does not receive his promotion and the novel's epilogue states that both Phil and Meredith eventually found much better jobs elsewhere.\n\nThe primary theme is sexual harassment. According to Crichton, it is based on a true story of a male protagonist who is being sexually harassed by a female executive, reversing the expected gender roles. The book has been referred to as both postfeminist and anti-feminist. Crichton offered a rebuttal at the close of the novel which states that a \"role-reversal\" story uncovers aspects of the subject that would not be as easily seen with a female protagonist.\n\nIn 1994, \"Disclosure\", a film adaptation of the novel was released. It starred Demi Moore, Michael Douglas, Donald Sutherland and Dennis Miller. Reviews to the movie were mixed but was a box office hit, as it made over $214 million worldwide. An unofficial Indian remake of the film titled \"Aitraaz\" was released in 2004. It starred Akshay Kumar and Priyanka Chopra in Douglas and Moore's roles with Kareena Kapoor as Kumar's wife. The Hindi film was later remade in Kannada as \"Shrimathi\" (2011).\nReviews were mostly favourable.\n\n\"The New York Times\"s Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said of \"Disclosure\" that it is:an elaborate provocation of rage in which a thousand fragments of revenge finally fall into place, like acid rain on wildfire. Meanwhile, Mr. Crichton also irrelevantly entertains us with a complex vision of the digital future, complete with cellular phones the size of credit cards, CD-ROM players that can store 600 books and database environments you can virtually walk around in with the guidance of a helpful angel who cracks wise.In a review comparing the novel with the film adaptation, Nathan Rabin expressed a negative view: he described \"Disclosure\" as \"loathsome\" and \"borderline-unreadable\", and inferior to its film version. Rabin also criticized the novel's characterization: \"Not since \"Atlas Shrugged\" has a novelist strayed so egregiously from plausible human behavior in dogged pursuit of making a muddled ideological point\".\n\n"}

S. Lowry, gaining some popularity since his death.\n\nHe is alleged to be the illegitimate son of comedian Frank Randle (born Arthur Hughes). His mother, Genevieve Delaney (also known as Willis (born Kelshaw)) was a music hall artiste who appeared with her sister, Mary Monica Kelshaw (also known as Lee); their act was known as Delaney and Lee.\n\nAt 13 years of age, he joined a textile design studio in Manchester where he worked for the next 32 years. He married his childhood sweetheart, Joan Campion, in 1949 and they had four children. He started to paint as a means of relaxation. There were two great influences in his life that were to effect his own development as a painter. One was the work of L. S. Lowry and the other was the memories of the happy years he spent as a boy in the Manchester of the 1930s with its smoke-laden skies, rattling tramcars and gas lamps.\n\nLowry's work made him aware of the many special qualities of the north and soon he began producing street scenes and industrial landscapes. His paintings were not stylised but a true likeness to their location. He set out to capture the atmosphere of the 1930s and all of his paintings capture the nostalgia of the period.\n\nIn April 1974 he held a very successful one-man show at the Tib Lane Gallery in Manchester, with all the pictures selling within half an hour at the preview. His paintings continued to sell well during his lifetime and he exhibited at the Royal Academy. Many of his paintings were produced as limited-edition prints.\n\nIn 2010 a painting by Delaney, in the style of L.S. Lowry, and painted as a homage to him, was auctioned after being seized by police from convicted fraudster Maurice Taylor. Taylor had purchased the painting for £7,500 in 2004; a signature \"L S Lowry, 1964\" had been added, before the painting was sold for £330,000 to a specialist dealer in Lowrys. The painting, of a snowbound Mill Street, Manchester, had been given an insurance valuation of £600,000 by the auctioneers Bonhams. The painting was said to lack fluidity, with muddy skies and with the lamp-posts wrongly highlighted in red.\n"}

It's a special case of operating under visual flight rules (VFR).\n\nThe definition for SVFR may be different in different countries, depending on the local aviation regulations.\n\nThe ICAO definition of Special VFR flight is a VFR flight cleared by air traffic control to operate within a control zone in meteorological conditions below visual meteorological conditions.\n\nAccording to Federal Aviation Regulations, SVFR operations can only be conducted in the controlled airspace around an airport where that controlled airspace extends down to the surface (so-called \"surface area\"). SVFR can only be conducted below 10,000 feet MSL in such areas.\n\nSVFR at night requires an IFR-equipped aircraft and an IFR-rated pilot in command (\"IFR\" means Instrument flight rules). In helicopters, there is no minimum flight visibility requirement, or a requirement for an IFR-equipped aircraft or an IFR-rated pilot in command.\n\nFlight under SVFR is only allowed in controlled airspace, and always requires clearance from air traffic control (ATC). It usually happens under two circumstances:\n\nThe aircraft need not necessarily be equipped for flight under IFR, and the aircraft must remain clear of clouds with the surface in sight, and maintain a certain flight visibility minimum (1,500 metres according to ICAO, one statute mile in the US, 1,500 m visibility, in sight of surface and clear of cloud in Europe). The pilot continues to be responsible for obstacle and terrain clearance.\n\nAn example of the use of SVFR is when a flight wishes to leave an airport in controlled airspace, to fly VFR in uncontrolled airspace, when the visibility is below the minimum for VFR flight in the control zone but not below the lower minimum for VFR flight in uncontrolled airspace. SVFR is never offered by Air Traffic Control. It must be requested by the Pilot in Command.\n\n"}

It is owned by the oil and gas industry contractor Saipem S.p.A.\n\nThe vessel was designed by Gusto Engineering during 1984.\n\nThe vessel was built between 1985 and 1987 by Fincantieri-Cantieri Navali Italiana S.p.A. at their Monfalcone yard, Trieste in north-eastern Italy. The vessel was built in two halves in a long dry dock. The halves were then floated out from the dry dock and mated. During the mating operation the halves were supported by temporary pontoons.\n\nThe hull mating was complete in early 1987 and the two cranes built by Officine Meccaniche Reggiane under subcontract to American Hoist & Derrick Company (Amhoist) were installed in sections by the Saipem crane vessel \"Castoro Otto\" in April of that year. The sea trials, which took two months, started in September, and on 15 December the vessel was handed over to Micoperi.\n\nThe cost of the vessel was not released by Micoperi but it was estimated in the technical press as being up to US$400 million.\n\nThe \"Saipem 7000\", originally named the \"Micoperi 7000\", was conceived in the mid-1980s by its original owners Micoperi as a multipurpose offshore oil platform installation vessel that would be able to install very large oil production platform decks (known as integrated decks) as well as the decks' supporting structures (known as jackets) using its two very large fully revolving cranes. It would also be able to support the offshore completion of the platform by providing hotel and workshop facilities for large construction crews. Saturation diving facilities would support subsea connection work. The vessel's size and semi-submersible form would allow it to operate in worse weather conditions than smaller and conventionally shaped vessels.\n\nThe huge cost of a vessel of this size would be offset by the cost and time savings made by the oil company as the large integrated decks could be completed, tested and commissioned onshore. Prior to the introduction of the large crane vessels, offshore oil platforms were made up of 1000 - 2000 tonne modules which were lifted into place individually by smaller SSCVs or monohull crane vessels and then connected together offshore, tested and then commissioned; this often took over a year. Other savings in the installation of the jackets could also be made.\n\nThe \"Saipem 7000\" has two NOV Lifting and Handling AmClyde model \"Saipem 7000\" fully revolving cranes. Each has a 140-metre-long boom fitted with 4 hooks. Each crane is capable of lifting up to 7,000 tonnes at 40 m lift radius using the main hook. The auxiliary hook capacities are 1st Auxiliary 2,500 tonnes at 75 m radius and 2nd Auxiliary 900 tonnes at 115 m. The whip hook has a capacity of 120 tonnes at 150 m. The 2nd Auxiliary hook can be deployed to a water depth of 450 m. The two cranes are capable of a tandem lift of 14,000 tonnes.\n\nEach crane was fitted with engines to power the boom and load hoists, 9 tugger lines and the crane slewing system. The cranes use of wire rope of various diameters.\n\nThe \"Saipem 7000\" was fitted with two ballast systems: a conventional pumped system which could transfer up to 24,000 tonnes of water per hour using 4 pumps and a free flooding system. The free flooding system used 2 m diameter valves to open certain compartments to the sea thus trimming or heeling the vessel. This allows the vessel to lift cargoes from barges much faster than if just the crane hoists are used.\n\nThe vessel's main power is provided by eight 12-cylinder 8400 hp diesel engines built by Grandi Motori Trieste, a former Fincantieri company. Later Grandi Motori was purchased by the Finnish Wärtsilä. They provide up to 47,000 kW of electric power at 10,000 V 60 Hz for propulsion and positioning. Auxiliary power is provided by two 6-cylinder GMT diesel engines. There is also an emergency generator.\n\nTotal power that can be supplied is .\n\nThe vessel was supplied with 16 anchor lines, 4 at each corner. Each line consists of 3350 m of 96 mm wire rope, 50 m of 92 mm chain and a 40-tonne Norshore Mark 3 anchor. Each line has its own single drum winch. The mooring system can be used in water depths of up to 450 m.\n\nThe \"Saipem 7000\" is also equipped with two anchor windlasses equipped with 550m of 130mm chain and 35 tonne anchor.\n\nThe vessel was fitted with 12 thrusters—6 on each hull. They are, per hull:\n\n\nThe vessel is equipped with a dynamic positioning system which uses either the thrusters or the mooring system or a combination of both, controlled by a number of computers, to hold the vessel in a predefined location.\n\n\n\nThe accommodation designed for 800 people contains 30 triple cabins, 335 double cabins, 35 singles and 5 suites. The accommodation also contains a large galley and mess rooms, a hospital, cinema and lounges.\n\nDuring the winter of 1999/2000 the \"Saipem 7000\" underwent a refit to enhance its positioning and power systems and add a J-lay system.\n\nThe power system was upgraded to provide up to 70,000 kW using 12 diesel generators. To improve the vessel's resilience the generators are distributed between four separate engine rooms.\n\nTwo 5,500 kW retractable azimuthing thrusters were added, one below the forward part of each hull. The DP system control computers were also replaced.\n\nThe hull, deck and deck structures were modified to accept the Gusto designed J-lay tower and its support equipment. The J-lay tower can lay pipe from 4\" to 32\" diameter with a tension of up to 525 tonnes (5.15 MN) using the tensioners and up to 2,000 tonnes (20 MN) when using friction clamps. The deck can used to store up to 10,000 tonnes of pipe.\n\nTo allow space for the increased equipment some items from the original specification were removed, including 2 anchor winches from the bow, all the moon pools, and the boilers used to provide steam for the steam hammers.\n\nThe vessel's first work was for Petrobras the Brazilian state oil company. The project consisted of the installation of 7 platforms in the Campos Basin. During this project the \"Micoperi 7000\" was also involved in the fighting of a well fire on the Enchova Platform. The \"Micoperi 7000\" then proceeded to the Gulf of Mexico where it installed the Jolliet Template for Conoco. In 1989 the \"Micoperi 7000\" arrived in the North Sea for the first time where it completed several projects in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. These were the Gyda Platform for BP, the Togi Template for Norsk Hydro and the Veslefrikk platform for Statoil. In 1990 and 1991, the Micoperi was used in the construction and assembly of the Mossgas FA platform off the south coast of South Africa near a town called Mossel Bay.\n\nWhilst the vessel remained busy, Micoperi were struggling financially as the low oil price prevalent in the late 1980s curtailed oil company investment. In 1991 Micoperi were forced to sell a number of their major assets including the \"Micoperi 7000\" to another Italian contractor Saipem. Saipem took over the running of the vessel though they retained the vessel crew and the shorebased engineering support. Saipem renamed the vessel the \"Saipem 7000\".\n\nThe vessel continued to work, installing oil and gas production platforms, in the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, off the Canadian east coast and the west coast of Africa throughout the nineties. It was also involved in the removal of one platform, the Esso Odin. During the late nineties Saipem planned an upgrade to the vessels DP system and installation of a J-Lay system.\n\nThe \"Saipem 7000\" has completed 4 J-Lay pipe projects Diana, Blue Stream, Ormen Lange and Medgaz, but its main work continues to be heavy lift in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. This includes both platform installation and removal and the addition of modules to existing platforms.\n\nThe \"Saipem 7000\" set the world offshore lifting record of 12,150 tons for the Sabratha deck in the Mediterranean Sea. A local record for the Gulf of Mexico (Mexican area) was set with the 10,473 tons of the PB-KU-A2 deck. In July 2010, the \"Saipem 7000\" broke another world record by lifting the new BP Valhall Production and Hotel topside of approximately 11,600 tonnes on Dynamic Positioning. The previous world record set at Sabratha was performed on the vessel's anchoring system. The first and third records were broken on 7 September 2019 when the \"Sleipnir\" lifted the 15,300 ton deck module for Noble's Leviathan.\n\nThe \"Saipem 7000\" laid the 24\" pipeline for the Blue Stream project between Russia and Turkey up to the record depth of 2,150 meters in the Black Sea. This was broken at the end of 2005 by the Balder which laid a pipeline in 2,200 meters of water, yet Balder was outbeat herself in 2014 by another laybarge of Saipem, the FDS2, which laid another 24\" pipeline in 2,250 meters offshore Brazil.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2002934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002934", "title": "Moving Day (Quebec)", "text": "Moving Day (Quebec)\n\nMoving Day () is a tradition, but not a legal requirement, in the province of Quebec, Canada, dating from the time when the province used to mandate fixed terms for leases of rental properties. It falls on July 1, which is also Canada Day.\n\nThe tradition began as a humanitarian measure of the French colonial government of New France, who forbade \"seigneurs\", the semi-feudal landlords of the \"seigneuries\", from evicting their tenant farmers before the winter snows had melted.. Historian Yvon Desloges notes that it was common to move in the spring in the 18th century, citing a 1750 bylaw by Intendant François Bigot. Additionally, Jean-Philippe Warren, a sociologist at Concordia University in Montreal, noted in a 2013 interview for \"The New York Times\" that French law in the 18th century set May 1 as the starting date for all legal agreements, including leases.\n\nLater, this evolved into a requirement that urban leases begin on May 1 and end on April 30. In law, this date was set in the Civil Code of Lower Canada of 1866. May 1 thus became \"Moving Day\", the day during which renters who wished to vacate their current premises physically changed domiciles.\n\nIn 1973, the Quebec government decided that it would be better to move Moving Day to the summer. This measure would allow children, especially the ones in primary school to complete their full year at the same establishment. Also, by moving the date to a holiday, workers would not have to sacrifice a working day. It has been noted that Quebec separtists saw this as a way to reduce celebrations of what was then called Dominion Day and is now Canada day . \nThis argument was strong for the tenants rights groups representing the average poorer class. Moreover, they moved the date from May 1st to July 1 because of the tendency for rough weather in early May. The law repealed sections of the Civil code setting fixed terms for leases as of 1974, but mandated a two-month lengthening of leases for following year as a transitory measure. However, tradition has held sway, and the vast majority of leases are still a year long and begin around July 1. In 2004, approximately 120,000 households moved on or around July 1, corresponding to 4% of the population. In 2013, the government of Montreal estimated that about 115,000 city residents moved each year, or about 7% of the city's 1.6 million people.\n\nIn the aforementioned interview, Warren added sociological reasons why July 1 has persisted as Moving Day. He noted that Francophone Quebecers move much more frequently than other Canadians, but generally stay in their old neighbourhoods, with some moving only across the street. According to Warren, a higher frequency of moves in the Francophone community makes a standard moving date more convenient for people changing their residences. As he put it, \"They are constantly on the move, but they don’t go anywhere.\"\n\nMoving Day is a boon and a headache for commercial moving companies, and people must reserve their services in advance, more than six months before moving day in some cases. During this period, moving companies work around the clock, with moving charges often being three times the normal rate. The short supply of movers in Montreal inspired entrepreneurs to offer a \"green\" moving service featuring heavy-duty bicycle trailers.\n\nIn Montreal, where only 38% of residents own their home, Moving Day is particularly busy and has been described as \"a kind of moving madness\". Exterior staircases leading up to second, third, or even fourth-storey apartments are common in many neighbourhoods, in part because historically this reduced the size of buildings and therefore decreased the owner's property taxes. These staircases are often narrow, curved, and metal – not ideal for nonprofessionals carrying major appliances. According to \"New York Times\" writer Ian Austen, \"unlike apartments in the rest of Canada, the ones here [in Montreal] rarely come with kitchen appliances, adding to the movers’ burdens.\" Cities also schedule extra garbage and recycling pickups for this period to deal with unwanted furniture and empty boxes left beside the road. According to Hydro-Québec, more than 700,000 Quebec households moved in 2009, including 225,000 on the island of Montreal.\n\nThe July 1 date of Moving Day also somewhat reduces the significance of Canada Day as a public holiday in Quebec, as many who might otherwise attend holiday festivities are occupied by moving. Suggestions that the move was a deliberate decision by Quebec sovereigntists to discourage participation in a patriotic Canadian holiday ignore the fact that the change in date from May 1 to July 1 was the result of a bill introduced by a federalist MNA, Jérôme Choquette of the Quebec Liberal Party.\n\nAlthough moving day is seen as a headache for most people, Montreal-based columnist Josée Legault sees a few positive aspects in the annual festival, pointing out that July 1 occurs at the end of the school year, not two months before as was the case before the 1970s. Bargain hunters —especially people who don't move— also enjoy the numerous garage sales occurring before moving day and the common practice of leaving behind slightly used furniture and appliances on the curb side or in the alley, in effect giving them to anyone in need.\n\nThe annual ritual has also been translated in Quebec's literature, music and cinema.

Such a conference may be initiated through either party, usually by the conveyance of a settlement offer; or it may be ordered by the court as a precedent (preliminary step) to holding a trial. Each party, the plaintiff and the defendant, is usually represented at the \"settlement conference\" by their own counsel or attorney. Conferences are frequently conducted by a judge or other neutral party, in the form of a mediation.\n\nIn many courts in the common law system, a case conference may be used to settle a case.\n\nIn some courts, the rules require that before certain types of motions or petitions will be heard by the judge, the lawyers must \"meet and confer\" to try to resolve the matter.\n\nOn December 1, 2008, the New York State Unified Court System began sending notices to borrowers in default who have high cost mortgages, whose mortgages were being foreclosed prior to September 1, 2008, offering voluntary settlement conferences. Borrowers with high cost mortgages whose mortgages entered or are entering into foreclosure from September 2008 on, will be required to attend a mandatory settlement conference prior to foreclosure proceedings. High cost loans are considered to have excessive fees, risk-based sub-prime percentage rates, negative amortizing payment options, and other features which may or may not be considered predatory lending practices.\n\nOn December 15, 2009, Governor David Paterson signed into law an expanded version of the mandatory settlement conference legislation. Section 3408 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of New York now provides that the court shall hold a mandatory settlement conference for all loans for one to four family homes within sixty days following the date proof of service is filed with the county clerk. The new law also provides that both the defendant homeowner and the plaintiff lender negotiate in good faith during their mandated settlement conference. The plaintiff lender is required to have a representative or attorney appear at the settlement conference with the authority to fully negotiate and settle the matter.\n\nThe foreclosure proceedings are effectively stopped until the referee or judicial hearing officer (JHO) in the settlement conference determines that the settlement conferences are concluded, either because the parties have successfully modified the home loan or obtained some other foreclosure alternative or the referee has determined that one of the parties has not satisfied its requirements under the law. Settlement conferences do not produce formal dispositions but may facilitate loan modifications and stop foreclosure. The referee or JHO will make a recommendation to the judge overseeing the foreclosure proceedings once the settlement conference is concluded.\n\n"}

It is a white, glassy solid with the formula BO. It is almost always found as the vitreous (amorphous) form; however, it can be crystallized after extensive annealing (that is, under prolonged heat).\n\nGlassy boron oxide (g-BO) is thought to be composed of boroxol rings which are six-membered rings composed of alternating 3-coordinate boron and 2-coordinate oxygen. Because of the difficulty of building disordered models at the correct density with many boroxol rings, this view was initially controversial, but such models have recently been constructed and exhibit properties in excellent agreement with experiment. It is now recognized, from experimental and theoretical studies, that the fraction of boron atoms belonging to boroxol rings in glassy BO is somewhere between 0.73 and 0.83, with 0.75 () corresponding to a 1:1 ratio between ring and non-ring units. The number of boroxol rings decays in the liquid state with increasing temperature.\n\nThe crystalline form (α-BO) (see structure in the infobox) is exclusively composed of BO triangles. This trigonal, quartz-like network undergoes a coesite-like transformation to monoclinic β-BO at several gigapascals (9.5 GPa).\n\nBoron trioxide is produced by treating borax with sulfuric acid in a fusion furnace. At temperatures above 750 °C, the molten boron oxide layer separates out from sodium sulfate. It is then decanted, cooled and obtained in 96–97% purity.\n\nAnother method is heating boric acid above ~300 °C. Boric acid will initially decompose into steam, (HO) and metaboric acid (HBO) at around 170 °C, and further heating above 300 °C will produce more steam and diboron trioxide. The reactions are:\n\nBoric acid goes to anhydrous microcrystalline BO in a heated fluidized bed. Carefully controlled heating rate avoids gumming as water evolves. Molten boron oxide attacks silicates. Internally graphitized tubes via acetylene thermal decomposition are passivated.\n\nCrystallization of molten α-BO at ambient pressure is strongly kinetically disfavored (compare liquid and crystal densities). Threshold conditions for crystallization of the amorphous solid are 10 kbar and ~200 °C. Its proposed crystal structure in enantiomorphic space groups P3(#144); P3(#145) (e.g., γ-glycine) has been revised to enantiomorphic space groups P321(#152); P321(#154)(e.g., α-quartz).\n\nBoron oxide will also form when diborane (BH) reacts with oxygen in the air or trace amounts of moisture:\n\n\n\n"}

The Rajapalayam breed of dogs is famous.\n\nThe name \"Rajapalayam\" derives from \"Raja\" and \"Palayam\", which in the Tamil language means a cantonment or fort. The town was previously called Raju Palayam, and finally Rajapalayam.\n\nThe town of Rajapalayam was later expanded by purchasing lands from Vijayarenga Chokkanatha Nayak (1706 -1732). Rajapalayam was constituted as a united board in the year 1885. It became a panchayat board in the year 1930. The railway reached Rajapalayam in the year 1927 and the town was electrified in 1937.\n\nThe mountains of the Western ghats are to the west of the city (12 km from the city), and the Sanjeevi hills are to the east. These moderate the climate, and several water catchment areas in the hills provide water for the city. Water is stored in the 6th mile water reservoir. There are several major lakes around the city, including Kondaneri, Karungulam, Pirandaikulam, and Sengulam. The soil in the area is classified by the government as red loam.\n\nThe climate of the region is of the semi-arid tropical monsoon type. The average temperature range is 20 °C to 37 °C.\n\nThe principal industry was initially agriculture. In 1936, Shri P. A. C. Ramasamy Raja started the first cotton spinning mill, called Rajapalayam Mills Ltd. Later, more textile mills were started including Sree Karpagambal Mills Ltd. Today, Rajapalayam is a major hub of the textile industry, famous for bandages, woven fabric, nightwear, and other products. The neighboring town of Chatrapatti (Virudhunagar Dist) is a large player in producing surgical cotton gauze, and nearby Dhalavaipuram and Muhavoor produce women's nightwear.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Rajapalayam had a population of 130,442 with 1,014 females for every 1,000 males, far above the national average of 929.

Rajapalayam old bus station is currently serving buses to nearby villages Seithur, Muhavoor, Dhalavaipuram and often called as Old bus stand or Town bus stand.\n\nThe Rajapalayam railway station is in the Southern Railways zone/Madurai division of Indian Railways and falls on the Virudhunagar to Kollam line. The station code is RJPM.\n\nThe Pothigai Express connects Rajapalayam to Chennai and runs daily. A Tri-weekly express train, the \"Silambu Express\" runs to Chennai via Aruppukottai, Manamadurai, Karaikudi and on to Sengottai. Kollam Express runs between Chennai Egmore and Kollam Jn daily via Trichy, Madurai, Rajapalayam, Tenkasi. Passenger trains also run to Madurai. There are two temporary services runs between Velakkani & Ernakulam Jn and between Chennai Egmore and Tirunelveli (via Tenkasi).\n\nThe nearest International airport is Madurai Airport (~80 km).\n\nAyyanar Kovil forest area is 10 km west of Rajapalayam on the eastern slope of the Western Ghats. The forest area has many streams, waterfalls, springs and a temple. Hiking in this forest area is one of the main recreations for Rajapalayam residents. Rajapalayam Water Reservoir, which provides water to the entire city, is situated en route to Ayyanar Falls. Rajapalayam Dam and Rajapalayam Water Treatment Plant are also situated adjacent to the Rajapalayam Water Reservoir.\n\nIt is also located in the foothills of Western Ghats which is around 10kms from the city. Its also a well known attraction for the falls.

The park is a fly-in park, and protects approximately of Arctic Lowlands at the northern end of the island. The most practical way to visit the park is to charter a plane, and currently the park has four landing sites. Aulavik is considered a polar desert and often experiences high winds. Precipitation for the park is approximately per year. In the southern regions of the park a sparsely vegetated upland plateau reaches a height of above sea level.\n\nThe park has the highest concentration of muskoxen on earth, with estimates of 68,000 to 80,000 animals on the island, approximately 20% of which are thought to reside in the park. It is also home to the endangered Peary caribou as well as the more common barren-ground caribou. Ptarmigan and ravens are considered the only year-round birds in the park, although 43 different species make seasonal use of the area. The park is completely treeless. Arctic foxes, brown and northern collared lemmings, Arctic hares and wolves roam the rugged terrain. Marine mammals along the north coast include polar bears, ringed seals, bearded seals, beluga whales and bowhead whales. Birds of prey in the park include snowy owls, rough-legged hawks, gyrfalcons, and peregrine falcons, who feed on the lemmings.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the Thule culture in southern Banks Island there were some Pre-Dorset culture people living in what is now the Aulavik National Park. Due to the cooling climate brought on by the Little Ice Age Banks Island was most likely deserted until the arrival of the Inuvialuit in the 17th century.\n\nAulavik National Park has two major bays, Castel Bay and Mercy Bay, and lies south of the McClure Strait. Captain Robert McClure, spent two winters in Mercy Bay on HMS \"Investigator\", while searching for the missing John Franklin's lost expedition between 1850 and 1853. McClure's team abandoned their ship in Mercy Bay and hiked across the sea-ice of the strait to board another ship, HMS \"Resolute\". Nangmagvik Lake is located within this national park.\n\nThe Mercy Bay area was visited by the Copper Inuit of Victoria Island to salvage materials left by McClure's party. They also hunted the caribou and muskox in the area as evidenced by the large number of food caches. In the 20th century the area was popular with Inuvialuit due to the large numbers of foxes. Until the fur trade went into decline, fox trapping provided a source of income for people from as far away as the Mackenzie Delta and the North Slope of Alaska. This influx of people led to the establishment of Sachs Harbour, the only community on the island.\n\n\n"}

England played its first international match in November 1972 against Scotland. Although most national football teams represent a sovereign state, as a member of the United Kingdom's Home Nations, England is permitted by FIFA statutes to maintain its own national side that competes in all major tournaments, with the exception of the Women's Olympic Football Tournament.\n\nEngland have qualified for the FIFA Women's World Cup five times, reaching the quarter-finals on three occasions; in 1995, 2007, and 2011, finishing third in 2015 and fourth in 2019. They reached the final of the UEFA Women's Championship in 1984 and 2009.\n\nThe success of the men's national football team at the 1966 FIFA World Cup led to an upsurge of interest in football from women within England. The Women's Football Association (WFA) was established in 1969 as an attempt to organise the women's game. That same year, Harry Batt formed an independent English team that competed in the Fédération Internationale Européenne de Football Féminine (FIEFF) European Cup. Batt's team also participated in two FIEFF World Cups held in Italy (1970) and Mexico (1971).\n\nFollowing an UEFA recommendation in 1972 for national associations to incorporate the women's game, the Football Association (FA) rescinded its 50-year ban on women playing on English Football League grounds. Shortly after, Eric Worthington was tasked by the WFA to assemble an official women's national team. England competed in its first international match against Scotland in Greenock on 18 November 1972, 100 years to the month after the first men's international. The team overturned a two-goal deficit to defeat their northern opponents 3–2, with Sylvia Gore scoring England's first international goal. Tom Tranter replaced Worthington as long term manager of the women's national football team and remained in that position for the next six years.\n\nMartin Reagan was appointed to replace Tranter in 1979. England reached the final of the inaugural European Competition for Women's Football, after beating Denmark 3–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals. Despite resolute defending, including a spectacular goal line clearance from captain Carol Thomas, the England team lost the first away leg 1–0 against Sweden, after a header from Pia Sundhage, but won the second home leg by the same margin, with a goal from Linda Curl. England lost the subsequent penalty shootout 4–3. Theresa Wiseman saved Helen Johansson's penalty but both Curl and Lorraine Hanson had their spot kicks saved by Elisabeth Leidinge.\n\nAt the 1987 European Competition for Women's Football, England again reached the semi-finals but lost 3–2 after extra time against holders Sweden, in a repeat of the previous final. The team settled for fourth, after losing the third place play-off against Italy 2–1. Reagan was sacked after England's 6–1 quarter-final loss against Germany at UEFA Women's Euro 1991, which left them unable to qualify for the inaugural FIFA Women's World Cup. John Bilton was appointed as head coach in 1991 after Barrie Williams's brief tenure.\n\nIn 1993, the FA took over the running of women's football in England from the WFA, replacing Bilton with Ted Copeland as national team manager. England managed to qualify for UEFA Women's Euro 1995, having previously missed out on the last three editions, but were beaten 6–2 on aggregate over two legs against Germany. Reaching the European semi-finals granted England a place at the World Cup for the first time. The team advanced from the group stage of the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup in Sweden, but lost out again to Germany 3–0 in the quarter-finals.\n\nHope Powell became the team's first full-time head coach in June 1998, succeeding her former coach Copeland. The European Championship expanded in 1997 to eight teams and moved from a biennial event to a quadrennial one. England qualified via the play-offs for the 2001 competition held in Germany, despite recording their biggest loss (away against Norway 8–0) during qualification, but did not advance past the group stage. England automatically qualified as hosts in 2005, but again did not make it to the semi-finals.\n\nQualification for the World Cup changed for the 1999 edition. European qualifiers were introduced, so that teams no longer needed to rely on advancing to the latter stages of the European Championship. England qualified unbeaten for the 2007 World Cup in China, winning Group 5 in the European qualifiers and recording their biggest win (away against Hungary, 13–0) in the process, ending a 12-year hiatus from the competition. After coming second in their group, they advanced into the quarter-finals to face the United States but lost 3–0.\n\nIn May 2009, central contracts were implemented to help players focus on full-time training without having to fit it around full-time employment. Three months later, at the European Championships in Finland, England marked their return to the recently expanded 12-team competition by reaching the final for the first time in 25 years. They advanced from Group C to the quarter-finals by virtue of being the top third-placed team, beating both the hosts and the Netherlands in the knockout stage on the way to the final. There they lost 6–2 to reigning champions Germany.\n\nEngland reached their third World Cup in 2011, having won Group 5 and their play-off 5–2 over two legs against Switzerland. In Germany, they topped Group B – ahead of eventual winners Japan. England were paired with France in the quarter-finals, with the match ending in a 1–1 draw. England had taken the lead with Jill Scott's chip, only to have Élise Bussaglia equalise with two minutes remaining. After extra time ended in stalemate, they lost the ensuing penalty shootout 4–3. Karen Bardsley had saved Camille Abily's initial penalty but misses by Claire Rafferty and Faye White sent England out of the competition.\n\nPowell left the role in August 2013 after a poor showing at the UEFA Women's Euro 2013, with England bowing out after the group stage.\n\nWelshman Mark Sampson succeeded Powell as England manager. England qualified for their third successive World Cup in August 2014 with a game to spare, winning all ten matches and topping Group 6. England played their first international match at the new Wembley Stadium, home to the men's national team, in a friendly against the reigning European champions Germany on 23 November 2014. England had not played Germany since their heavy defeat in the European Championship final five years earlier. They lost the match 3–0, marking the 20th attempt at which England had failed to record an official win over Germany.\n\nAt the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada, England lost their opening group game to France but won their remaining group games against Mexico and Colombia, easing through to the last 16 to play 1995 champions Norway. A 2–1 win set up a meeting with hosts Canada in the quarter-finals. Despite facing not only a strong Canadian team but a capacity partisan crowd at BC Place in Vancouver, England progressed to the semifinals of the Women's World Cup for the first time in their history with another 2–1 win, which also marked the first semifinal appearance by any England senior team since the men reached the last four of the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Playing reigning World Cup holders Japan in the semi-finals, England conceded a penalty kick, which Aya Miyama converted past Karen Bardsley. Japan then conceded a penalty as Yuki Ogimi clipped Steph Houghton and Fara Williams slotted it past Ayumi Kaihori to level the game. However, in the last minute of the game, Laura Bassett scored an own goal to send Japan through to the final. England eventually finished in third place by beating Germany 1–0 after extra time after a Williams penalty, their first time beating their archrivals in the women’s game. It marked the best finish for any England senior team since the men’s team famously won the 1966 World Cup as hosts.\n\nEngland qualified for the UEFA Women's Euro 2017 in the Netherlands and won all three of their group games at the tournament. England beat France 1–0 in the quarter-finals before meeting hosts and eventual champions, the Netherlands. In the semi-finals, England conceded three goals without reply and were knocked out of the tournament.\n\nIn September 2017, Sampson was sacked from his role as manager by the FA after evidence of \"inappropriate and unacceptable\" behaviour was uncovered during his tenure at Bristol Academy. The FA in January 2019 agreed to pay a \"significant\" financial settlement to Sampson, on the week his claim for unfair dismissal was due to be heard in court. He was replaced by Phil Neville, who had played at Manchester United – including in their 1999 treble winning season – and Everton and been capped by the England men but had never before held a high-profile managing job.\n\nAfter being appointed manager, Neville's first games in charge were at the 2018 SheBelieves Cup. In their first game, England defeated France 4–1, then drew 2–2 against Germany. They went into the final game against the United States with the opportunity to win the tournament, but lost 1–0. Second place was the highest England had finished at the SheBelieves Cup.\n\nEngland continued with World Cup qualification in 2018. On 6 April they drew 0–0 against Wales. After the qualifying games in June, England and Wales were guaranteed the first two spots in qualifying Group 1, and England's 3–0 win against Wales in August 2018 saw them clinch the group and qualify for the World Cup finals.\n\nIn the 2019 SheBelieves Cup, England won the tournament for the first time after winning their first match 2–1 against Brazil, drawing 2–2 with the United States and defeating Japan 3–0.\n\nIn the 2019 Women's World Cup in France, England won group D, beating local rivals Scotland and archrival Argentina to qualify for the knockout phase, before beating Japan. England beat both Cameroon and then Norway 3–0 to advance to the semifinal against United States in Lyon – the team's third straight major tournament semifinal. However, similar to the previous two tournaments, England once again failed to make the final, losing 2–1. Alex Morgan scored the winner after Ellen White had equalised following Christen Press' opening goal, while White had an equaliser ruled out by VAR and Houghton had a penalty saved by Alyssa Naeher. The team finished in fourth after losing the third place play-off to Sweden 2–1.\n\nIn the wake of the World Cup exit, England's form dropped as the Lionesses struggled in a series of friendlies to end the year including a 2–1 defeat by Germany at Wembley Stadium on 9 November 2019. The game set a new record attendance for an England women's match at 77,768, becoming the second-biggest crowd for a women's game on English soil after the 2012 Olympic final which was watched by 80,203 at the same venue. The poor run continued into 2020 as England failed to defend their title at the 2020 SheBelieves Cup in March. Losses to the United States and Spain made it seven defeats in 11 games, the team's worst stretch since 2003, mounting further pressure on Neville who admitted he was personally responsible for England's \"unacceptable\" form amid increased media scrutiny.\n\nEngland matches at selected international tournaments, friendlies, Euro and World Cup finals are currently broadcast by BT Sport (exclude Euro and World Cup finals) and BBC respectively. Previously, the Euro and World Cup finals broadcast by Channel 4 (Euro 2017 only) and Eurosport.\n\n\"Statistics correct as of 11 March 2020\"\n\nThe following 23 players were named to the squad for the 2020 SheBelieves Cup.\n\n\"Caps and goals are updated as of 11 March 2020 after the match against .\"\n\nThe following players have also been called up to the England squad within the last 12 months.\n\n\nCarol Thomas was the first player to reach 50 caps in 1985, before retiring from representative football later that year, having amassed 56 caps. Fara Williams holds the record for England appearances, having played 172 times since 2001. She overtook previous record holder Rachel Yankey in August 2014, in a friendly against Sweden. Yankey had passed Gillian Coultard's 119 record England women caps in September 2012, in a European qualifying match against Croatia, and Peter Shilton's 125 record England international caps in June 2013, in a friendly against Japan.\n\nKelly Smith has scored the most goals for England, with 46 over a 20-year international career. She surpassed Karen Walker's record of 40 goals in September 2010, in a World Cup qualifying play-off against Switzerland.\n\nThis list includes match results from the past 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\nEngland have qualified for the FIFA Women's World Cup five times (1995, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019) and failed to qualify for three competitions (1991, 1999, 2003). The England team reached the quarter-finals on three occasions, losing out to Germany in 1995, the United States in 2007 and France on penalties in 2011. In 2015, however, England earned the bronze medal for the first time, under Mark Sampson, by beating Germany in the third place play-off.\n\nEngland does not participate in the Women's Olympic Football Tournament, as the country does not have its own National Olympic Committee (NOC). Since England falls under the jurisdiction of the British Olympic Association, remit for an Olympic football team requires support from all four Home Nation associations. The Scottish Football Association (SFA), the Football Association of Wales (FAW) and the Irish Football Association (IFA) have all previously objected to the premise over fears that the team would erode the independence of their individual football associations. However, members of its team have played for the Great Britain women's Olympic football team at London 2012 having been granted automatic qualification as the host nation. The Home Nations once again agreed to a GB Women's team in time for Tokyo 2020 with England's result at the 2019 World Cup counting as the team's attempt to qualify. They qualified as one of the last three remaining European nations.\n\nEngland first entered the UEFA Women's Championship in 1984, reaching the final that year and in 2009. The team have reached the semi-finals on three other occasions (1989, 1995, 2017), but failed to make it out of the group stage in three other editions (2001, 2005, 2013). England did not qualify in 1989, 1991, 1993 and 1997.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2003021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003021", "title": "Roger Price (comedian)", "text": "Roger Price (comedian)\n\nRoger Price (March 6, 1918 – October 31, 1990) was an American humorist, author and publisher, who created \"Droodles\" in the 1950s, followed by his collaborations with Leonard B. Stern on the \"Mad Libs\" series. Price and Stern became partners with Larry Sloan in the publishing firm Price Stern Sloan.\n\nPrice was born in Charleston, West Virginia, and grew up in the mining town of Widen, West Virginia. He graduated from Greenbrier Military School in 1934, then attended the University of Michigan (1934–1936) and the American Academy of Art in Chicago (1936–1938).\n\nDuring the 1940s, he wrote for \"The Bob Hope Show\" and worked with Hope on a newspaper humor column. On Broadway he performed in Arthur Klein's musical revue \"Tickets, Please!\" (1950), and he contributed sketch material to Leonard Sillman's \"New Faces of 1952\". Price hosted the television panel show \"How To\" (1951), and he was a panelist on other game shows of the early 1950s: \"Who's There?\" \"What Happened?\" \"That Reminds Me\", \"The Name's the Same\" and \"What's My Line?\"\n\nIn 1953, Price invented \"Droodles\", a syndicated feature which he described as \"a borkley-looking sort of drawing that doesn't make any sense until you know the correct title.\" When Simon & Schuster published Price's \"Droodles\" in 1953, the book launched a Droodle craze that was fueled by a series of ads in college newspapers offering cash prizes for Droodles created by college students. In 1954, Price hosted a \"Droodles\" television game show with panelists Marc Connelly, Denise Lor and Carl Reiner. More Droodles were gathered in follow-up books, \"The Rich Sardine\" (1954) and \"Oodles of Droodles\" (1955). Over the years, many of the drawings (minus the author's droll commentary) have been reprinted in collections such as \"Classic Droodles\". One of Price's original Droodles serves as the cover art for Frank Zappa's 1982 album \"Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch\". Price's other captions for that drawing include \"Mother pyramid feeding her baby.\"\n\nIn 2000, after Stern and Sloan launched another publishing company, Tallfellow Press, they acquired the rights to \"Droodles\" and reissued it as \"Droodles: The Classic Collection\".\n\nPrice had four articles in Harvey Kurtzman's \"Mad\" in 1955–1956 and later contributed to Kurtzman's 1960s magazine \"Help!\". In the introduction to \"Mad\"'s first paperback collection, \"The Mad Reader\" (Ballantine Books, 1954), he described Kurtzman's appearance:\nThe same year the Droodle was born, Price and Stern invented \"Mad Libs\" (although the first book in the series was not published until 1958). The title came about when the two were in Sardi's and overheard an actor arguing with his agent. The actor wanted to \"ad-lib\" an interview, but his agent thought such an approach was \"mad\".\n\nAccording to Stern, the concept was hatched accidentally. Stern was scripting an episode for \"The Honeymooners\" in 1953 when Price came by. Stern recalled, \"I was trying to find the right word to describe the nose of Ralph Kramden's new boss. So I asked Roger for an idea for an adjective and before I could tell him what it was describing, he threw out 'clumsy' and 'naked'. We both started laughing. We sat down and wrote a bunch of stories with blanks in them. That night we took them to a cocktail party and they were a great success ... We were turned down by every publisher in the New York area. Publishers told us it wasn't a book and suggested we approach game manufacturers, but they also rejected us and advised us to talk to publishers. It became a well-worn path.\"\n\nA \"Publishers Weekly\" article described the rise of \"Mad Libs\" after the initial 1958 publication:\nDuring the 1960s, Price opened the first New York art gallery devoted solely to cartoons.\n\nIn 1965–1967 he published and edited the short-lived humor publication, \"Grump\", which featured such contributors as Isaac Asimov, Christopher Cerf, Derek Robinson, Susan Sands, Jean Shepherd, and cartoonists Don Silverstein and David C. K. McClelland.\n\nHe was the co-creator with Stanley Ralph Ross of the short-lived 1977 NBC situation comedy \"The Kallikaks\", and he also wrote for the show.\n\nPrice was married four times; all the marriages ended in divorce. He had two children with his second wife, Bettina Lerfield. \n\nAt the time of his death in 1990, Price lived in Studio City, California.\n\nIn One Head and Out the Other (Ballantine, 1951), which popularized the catchphrase \"I had one grunch, but the eggplant over there.\" The nonsense non sequitur was immediately adopted by science fiction fandom, appearing occasionally in science fiction fanzines, as noted in \"Fancyclopedia II\" (1959). Using the 18th-century historian Edward Gibbon's book \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" as a comparison to America's upheaval in the 60's, this satirical book compares Roman decline to America's woes. In Price's \"In One Head and Out the Other\", the \"bible of Avoidism\", his character Clayton Slope \"had a clever trick of saying any conceivable sentence so that it sounded like 'I had one grunch but the eggplant over there.' Fans find the expression useful, too ... \"Avoidism: Not originally fannish at all, but a philosophy devised in a rather stomach-turning book, \"In One Head and Out the Other\", this doctrine became confused/associated with the Gandhi-following folk of Eric Frank Russell's \"And Then There Were None.\" It inspired an APA, MYOB and an Avoidist Movement which avoided amounting to anything. Tenets are those implied by the root word. Lee Hoffman explains that three types of avoidism are distinguished: \n\nIn \"pure avoiding\", one avoids everything except eating, breathing and metabolizing. In \"applied avoiding\", one avoids as many things as possible. (Bus drivers are good at this sort of thing, like avoiding people waiting at bus stops.) \"Active avoidism\" isn't true avoidism and is practiced to Publicize the Cause, or as an exercise in Avoiding. Under active avoidism there is the subgroup \"Counteravoiding\"; to counteravoid vegetarianism, for instance, one eats meat. Leeh concluded: \"A last word on Avoidism: I had one grunch but the eggplant over there.\"\n\nAn annoying Price dissident in \"In One Head and Out the Other\" who crops up from time to time to object forlornly to Avoidist doctrine in many of its guises is one Dr. Carl Gassoway, whom Price promptly and heartlessly dismisses every time as a troublemaker; a refreshing Price ingénue who similarly appears and reappears is Miss Patricia Delray. In a key chapter, Price advised mothers to encourage their offspring to adopt Avoidist habits and responses to the tribulations of real life is to have them read, as a nightly bedtime story, his adaptation of Prokofiev's \"Peter and the Wolf\" (which he first wanted to use in its original form until the composer demanded too many rubles' royalty), namely Milton and the Rhinoceros, in which the latter triumphs by overcoming and eating the former, whose final blunder was to mistake the \"FIERCE RHINOCEROS!!\" (as Price instructed the mother to shout loudly at key points in the narrative), when he first came upon the beast, for a Studebaker.

These districts later merged, as did the Tigard high school district (2J) and the Tualatin high school district (26J).\n\nFrom its inception until 1992, the district operated only one \"senior\" high school, Tigard High, which covered grades 10-12. Fowler and Twality Junior High Schools covered grades 7-9. In 1992, a second high school, Tualatin High, was opened, and the district took the opportunity to switch to a middle school system in which the two high schools would cover grades 9-12, the existing junior high schools changed to middle schools covering grades 6-8, and the elementary schools covered grades K-5. A third middle school, Hazelbrook, was also added in 1992.\n\nWhen Tualatin High opened, new school attendance boundaries were drawn; most students at Twality would attend Tualatin High and most students at Fowler would attend Tigard High.

{"id": "2003025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003025", "title": "Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy", "text": "Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy\n\nAnterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is a medical condition involving loss of vision caused by damage to the optic nerve as a result of insufficient blood supply (ischemia). This form of ischemic optic neuropathy is generally categorized as two types: arteritic AION (or AAION), in which the loss of vision is the result of an inflammatory disease of arteries in the head called temporal arteritis, and non-arteritic AION (abbreviated as NAION, or sometimes simply as AION), which is due to non-inflammatory disease of small blood vessels.\n\nNAION typically presents suddenly upon awakening. The afflicted person notes seeing poorly in one eye. Vision in that eye is obscured by a dark shadow, often involving just the upper or lower half of vision, usually the area closer to the nose. There is no pain. Within approximately six months following the infarct, visual acuity improves by three or more lines of vision on the Snellen Chart (the chart with smaller letters on each lower line) in 42.7% of patients, while in 12.4% of patients, vision worsens by three lines. Opposite eye involvement occurs in approximately 15% to 20% of patients with NAION within 5 years. It is not always devastating as visual acuity may remain only moderately impaired. Furthermore, most cases of NAION involve the loss of a hemifield (either the upper or lower half of the visual field, but not both). A few cases of NAION involve near-total loss of vision.\n\nThe mechanism of injury for NAION used to be quite controversial. However, experts in the field have come to a consensus that most cases involve two main risk factors. The first is a predisposition in the form of a type of optic disc shape. The optic disc is where the axons from the retinal ganglion cells collect into the optic nerve. The optic nerve is the bundle of axons that carry the visual signals from the eye to the brain. This optic nerve must penetrate through the wall of the eye, and the hole to accommodate this is usually 20-30% larger than the nerve diameter. In some patients the optic nerve is nearly as large as the opening in the back of the eye, and the optic disc appears \"crowded\" when seen by ophthalmoscopy. A crowded disc is also referred to as a \"disc at risk\". While a risk factor, the vast majority of individuals with crowded discs do not experience NAION.\n\nThe second major risk factor involves more general cardiovascular risk factors. The most common are diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol levels. While these factors predispose a patient to develop NAION, the most common precipitating factor is marked fall of blood pressure during sleep (nocturnal arterial hypotension)- that is why at least 75% of the patients first discover visual loss first on waking from sleep. These vascular risk factors lead to ischemia (poor blood supply) to a portion of the optic disc. The disc then swells, and in a crowded optic disc, this leads to compression and more ischemia.\n\nSince both eyes tend to have a similar shape, the optometrist or ophthalmologist will look at the good eye to assess the anatomical predisposition. The unaffected eye has a 14.7% risk of NAION within five years.\n\nA number of uncontrolled single case or small number of patient reports have associated NAION with use of oral erectile dysfunction drugs.\n\nSince arteritic AION is similar in presentation to non-arteritic AION, patients over the age of 50 diagnosed with NAION must be evaluated to exclude AAION (symptoms: painful jaw muscle spasms, scalp tenderness, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, myalgias and loss of appetite); NAION patients over the age of 75 should always be tested.\n\nThe distinction between AAION and non-arteritic AION was made to highlight the different etiologies of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. AAION is due to temporal arteritis (also called giant-cell arteritis), an inflammatory disease of medium-sized blood vessels (Chapel-Hill-Conference) that occurs especially with advancing age. In contrast, NAION results from the coincidence of cardiovascular risk factors in a patient with \"crowded\" optic discs. Non-arteritic AION is more common than AAION and usually occurs in slightly younger persons. While only a few cases of NAION result in near total loss of vision, most cases of AAION result in nearly complete vision loss.\n\nNonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is an isolated white-matter stroke of the optic nerve (ON). NAION is the most common cause of sudden optic nerve-related vision loss, affecting more than 10,000 Americans every year, often bilaterally. No clinically effective treatments exist, largely because little is known about its pathophysiology, and there are few histopathological studies of the acute condition.\n\nAn exhaustive review article published in March 2009 described the latest information on arteritic and non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, both anterior (A-AION and NA-AION) and posterior (A-PION, NA-PION, and surgical).\n\nOnce NAION happens, it was thought that there was no accepted treatment to reverse the damage. However, a recent uncontrolled retrospective large study has shown that if patients are treated with large doses of corticosteroid therapy during the early stages of NAION, in eyes with initial visual acuity of 20/70 or worse, seen within 2 weeks of onset, there was visual acuity improvement in 70% in the treated group compared to 41% in the untreated group (odds ratio of improvement: 3.39; 95% CI:1.62, 7.11; p ¼ 0.001). That study and a natural history study on NAION (Ophthalmology 2008;115: 298–305.) showed that visual acuity can improve up to 6 months and not after that. To minimize the risk of further visual loss in the fellow eye or the same eye, it is essential to reduce the risk factors. Common sense dictates trying to control the cardiovascular risk factors for many reasons, including protection from this happening to the second eye. Sudden vision loss should lead to an ophthalmological consultation. If NAION is suspected, then ideally a neuro-ophthalmologist's consultation should be obtained.\n\nA recent Cochrane Review sought to determine the extent of safety and efficacy of optic nerve decompression surgery for NAION, compared to other treatments, or no treatment. The one study included in the review found no improvements in visual acuity among patients who underwent surgery for NAION, and adverse events (pain, double vision) experienced by participants who underwent surgery.\n\nThere is much research currently underway looking at ways to protect the nerve (neuroprotection) or even regenerate new fibers within the optic nerve. So far there is no evidence in human studies that the so-called neuroprotectors have any beneficial effect in NAION.\nHowever, there is a new current clinical trial for the treatment of NAION in the United States with plans to include sites in India, Israel, Germany and Australia (see NORDICclinicaltrials.com and https://clinicaltrials.gov/). This trial will test the use of a synthetic siRNA that blocks caspase 2, an important enzyme in the apoptosis cycle. \nIn addition to such research, patents have been applied for by Pfizer, The University of Southern California, Otsuka Pharmaceutical and other individual inventors for innovations related to the treatment of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.\n\nIt is estimated that the incidence of AION in the US is about 8,000 persons per year.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2003043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003043", "title": "Triple Concerto (Beethoven)", "text": "Triple Concerto (Beethoven)\n\nLudwig van Beethoven's Concerto for Violin, Cello, and Piano in C major, Op. 56, more commonly known as the Triple Concerto, was composed in 1803 and later published in 1804 by Breitkopf & Härtel. The choice of the three solo instruments effectively makes this a concerto for piano trio, and it is the only concerto Beethoven ever completed for more than one solo instrument. A typical performance takes approximately thirty-seven minutes.\n\nBeethoven's early biographer Anton Schindler claimed that the \"Triple Concerto\" was written for Beethoven's royal pupil, the Archduke Rudolf of Austria. The Archduke, who became an accomplished pianist and composer under Beethoven's tutelage, was only in his mid-teens at this time, and it seems plausible that Beethoven's strategy was to create a showy but relatively easy piano part that would be backed up by two more mature and skilled soloists. However, there is no record of Rudolf's ever performing the work—it was not publicly premiered until 1808, at the summer \"Augarten\" concerts in Vienna—and when it came to be published, the concerto bore a dedication to a different patron: Prince Lobkowitz (Franz Joseph Maximilian Fürst von Lobkowitz).\n\nThe concerto is divided into three movements:\n\n\nThe first movement is broadly scaled and cast in a moderate march tempo, and includes decorative solo passage-work and leisurely repetitions, variations, and extensions of assorted themes. A common feature is a dotted rhythm (short-long, short-long) that lends an air of graciousness and pomp that is not exactly \"heroic,\" but would have conveyed a character of fashionable dignity to contemporary listeners—and perhaps a hint of the noble \"chivalric\" manner that was becoming a popular element of novels, plays, operas, and pictures. The jogging triplets that figure in much of the accompaniment also contribute to this effect. In this movement, as in the other two, the cello enters solo with the first subject. Unusual for a concerto of this scale, the first movement begins quietly, with a gradual crescendo into the exposition, with the main theme later introduced by the soloists. Also unusually, the exposition modulates to A minor instead of the expected G major (Beethoven's friend Ferdinand Ries later did the same mediant transition in his sixth concerto). This movement takes sixteen to nineteen minutes.\n\nThe slow movement, in A-flat major, is a large-scale introduction to the finale, which follows it without pause. The cello and violin share the melodic material of the movement between them while the piano provides a discreet accompaniment. This movement takes about five to six minutes.\n\nDramatic repeated notes launch into the third movement, a polonaise (also called \"polacca\"), an emblem of aristocratic fashion during the Napoleonic era, which is, thus, in keeping with the character of \"polite entertainment\" that characterizes this concerto as a whole. The bolero-like rhythm, also characteristic of the polonaise, can be heard in the central minor theme of the final movement. This movement takes about thirteen to fourteen minutes.\n\nIn addition to the violin, cello, and piano soloists, the concerto is scored for one flute, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings. The flute, oboes, trumpets, and timpani are tacet during the second movement.\n\nSeveral popular recordings of the Triple Concerto include:\n\n\n"}

The park was initially known as \"Baffin Island National Park\" when it was established in 1972, but the name was changed in 1976 to its current name to better reflect the region and its history. It features many terrains of Arctic wilderness, such as fjords, glaciers, and ice fields. Although Auyuittuq was established in 1972 as a national park reserve, it was upgraded to a full national park in 2000.\n\nAuyuittuq National Park is located on the Cumberland Peninsula of Baffin Island in Nunavut. The park is located within the Arctic Circle. The park covers and is located partially within the Penny Highlands and contains the Penny Ice Cap. The Penny Ice Cap, made of ice sitting on Precambrian granite, creates a series of glaciers, among them the Coronation Glacier. The land reflects the geological history of the area, with deep valleys between the peaks, which include Mount Asgard with an face, and Mount Thor with a face. Along the coast are deep, narrow fjords. In Akshayuk Pass, the winds can reach .\n\nThe nearest towns are Qikiqtarjuaq and Pangnirtung. Visitors wishing to enter the park are required by Parks Canada to register at the park office in Pangnirtung or Qikiqtarjuaq, and attend an orientation session. Park user fees apply.\n\nFirst established in 1972 as Baffin Island National Park, in 1975, Parks Canada chose to rename the park in order to better reflect the landscape and the Inuit history within the region. After some debate, the name was changed to Auyuittuq National Park, which is an Inuktitut word meaning \"the place that does not melt\".\n\nLittle vegetation can be found in Auyuittuq Park, although the plants found there range from flowers such as mountain avens, campion, \"Papaver\", and saxifrage to shrubs like dwarf birch, Arctic willow, and heather. Many of the plants in Auyuittuq Park grow in clumps to create their own warmer \"microclimate\" to survive the harsh Arctic conditions.\n\nBecause of the exceptionally low vegetation supply on land, wildlife is very scarce. However, the park is bordered on three sides by sea and marine life is found within the park's boundaries. Species that live in Auyuittuq Park include lemmings (both the North American brown lemming and the northern collared lemming), red foxes, snowy owls, peregrine falcons, ermines, rough-legged hawks, gyrfalcons, beluga whales, snow geese, polar bears, wolves, narwhals, Canada geese, Arctic foxes, Arctic hares, and some barren-ground caribou.\n\nThe most common backpacking route in the park is known as Akshayuk Pass, and follows the Weasel and Owl rivers via Summit Lake. In 2008, heavy rain and warm weather caused Summit Lake to burst through its banks, flooding the Weasel River and washing away the Windy Lake bridge. As a result, the hiking routes in the pass are limited to either side of the Weasel River.\n\n\n"}

In December 1946, after two months as a mathematics student at Hanoi University, he had to return to the south, because the French had invaded and seized Hanoi, and the University had closed. Hoàng Tụy taught secondary school in Quảng Ngãi province in the Fifth Liberated Zone from 1947 to 1951, during which time he wrote a geometry textbook that was published by the Việt Minh press -- perhaps the first time a guerrilla movement published a math book. In the early 1950s, Hoàng Tụy studied with Lê Văn Thiêm in the university that the Việt Minh had opened in a liberated zone in the far north near the Chinese border.

{"id": "2003091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003091", "title": "Saalburg", "text": "Saalburg\n\nThe Saalburg is a Roman fort located on the main ridge of the Taunus, northwest of Bad Homburg, Hesse, Germany. It is a cohort fort, part of the Limes Germanicus, the Roman linear border fortification of the German provinces. The Saalburg, located just off the main road roughly halfway between Bad Homburg and Wehrheim is the most completely reconstructed Roman fort in Germany. Since 2005, as part of the Upper German \"limes\", it forms part of a UNESCO World Heritage site. In the modern numbering system for the \"limes\", it is ORL 11.\n\nThe earliest examinations of the site were undertaken from 1853 to 1862 by the Nassau Antiquarian Society under the direction of Friedrich Gustav Habel (1793–1867). But the great impulse to provincial Roman archaeology in Germany came in 1892, when the \"Reichs-Limes-Kommission\" (the Imperial Commission for the Roman borders), then chaired by Theodor Mommsen began to research the course of the Limes Germanicus in its entirety, as well as the location of all its forts. In the course of this enormous project, not completed for decades, intensive exploration of the Saalburg and its surroundings was pursued by the archaeologists charged with this stretch of the \"limes\", Louis Jacobi (1836–1910) and his son and successor Heinrich Jacobi (1855–1946). In 1897, Kaiser Wilhelm II, following a suggestion by L. Jacobi, ordered the reconstruction of the Saalburg fort according to the detailed results of its excavation. As a result, the Saalburg became the most completely reconstructed fort on the entire \"limes\". It also houses the Saalburg Museum, one of the two most important institutions dedicated to the study of the German Limes (the other being the Limesmuseum of Aalen). From 1967 to 1993, the museum was directed by the well-known archaeologist Dietwulf Baatz, whose many publications fostered a broad interest in provincial Roman archaeology well beyond specialist circles.\n\nSince prehistoric times, trade routes like the \"Lindenweg\" or \"Linienweg\" connected the Rhine-Main plain with the Usingen basin, which had been a centre of population since the Neolithic. Such routes would have followed a course from the mouth of the Nidda near Höchst, northwards across the low Taunus ridge, as does the modern Bundesstraße 456. A location along major communication routes almost always equals a strategic importance. Thus, it is no surprise that the mountain pass beside the Saalburg was first fortified by Roman troops during Domitian's wars against the Chatti (AD 81-96), when two simple earthen enclosures were erected (\"Schanzen\" A and B, located between the restored fort and the modern road).\n\nShortly after the two enclosures, around AD 90, a simple wood-and-earth fort was built to house a \"numerus\". A \"numerus\" was a unit of auxiliary troops consisting of 2 \"centuriae\" and numbering about 160 men. There is some evidence that the troop stationed at this fort was a \"numerus Brittonum\", i.e. a unit from Britain, but this is not entirely clear.\n\nLate in the reign of Hadrian, c. AD 135, the \"numerus\" fort was replaced with a much larger (3.2 hectare) fort for a cohort, a unit of about 500 men. The new castle was reoriented to face the growing Roman city of Nida (now Heddernheim). Originally, it had dry-built wood-and stone walls, which were replaced in the 2nd half of the 2nd century with mortared stone walls and an earthen ramp (147 × 221 m). The reconstructed fort is based on that third and last architectural phase, but reminders of the second phase are visible in the \"retentura\" (the back of the fort). Part of the second-phase defensive ditch has also been restored and can be inspected there.\n\nThe cohort fort was occupied by the \"Cohors II Raetorum civium Romanorum equitata\" (2. partially mounted Raetian cohort with Roman citizenship), a partially equestrian 500-men infantry unit, probably under the command of the legionary headquarters at Mogontiacum (modern Mainz). The cohort had initially been stationed at \"Aquae Mattiacorum\" (Wiesbaden), had then been moved to the Butzbach fort (ORL 14) and finally to the Saalburg.\n\nThe fort existed in that form and with that occupancy until the fall of the German \"limes\" in c. AD 260. During the intervening period, the name of the unit is repeatedly mentioned in stone inscriptions, as are the names of some of its commanders.\n\nIn the early 3rd century, the situation along the limes became increasingly unsettled. A preventative war under Caracalla, who marched against the Alamanni and their Chatti allies from Raetia and Mogontiacum in AD 213, lowered the Germanic pressure on the border only temporarily. The town of Nida (capital of the regional \"civitas\") was given a defensive enclosure around that time. Already around 233, the Alemanni entered Roman territory again; further major incursions took place in 254 and 260. Eventually, all areas east of the Rhine were lost during the major political and economic crisis of the mid-3rd century. In the course of these events, the Saalburg fort appears to have been abandoned deliberately and without military action.\n\nAfter the abandonment of the Upper Germanic Limes, the fort was used as a quarry.\n\nThe Saalburg in its final architectural phase, in the form reconstructed today, as a cohort fort typical for this part of the limes, a 147 by 221 m rectangle with 4 gates.\n\nThe 3.25 m interior was enclosed by a double ditch and a mortared defensive wall; its external face was whitewashed and painted with a trompe-l'œil pattern of ashlar blocks. On the inside, an earthen ramp was placed along the length of the wall, to enable defenders to access the top. The corners were rounded and not crowned with towers, but all four gates were flanked by two towers each.\n\nThe fort was oriented in such a way that its main gate, or \"porta praetoria\" faced south-south-east, that is away from the \"limes\" but towards Nida. The central structure of the fort was a large \"principia\", a central plaza surrounded by housing or offices for the higher officers, which was flanked by a roofed hall for assemblies of the fort's garrison. The \"praetentura\" (front part of the fort) contained the \"praetorium\" (the fort commander's residence) to the west of the \"via praetoria\", and a large \"horreum\" (grain store) to its east. The rest of the fort's interior, today a park-like area of grass and trees, should be visualised as packed with further buildings: stables, magazines, workshops and, of course, the actual troop quarters, subdivided into contubernia. Two such troop barracks have been reconstructed in the southeast part of the fort. For the general arrangement and terminology of Roman fort architecture, see Castra.\n\nThe Saalburg is not only the most consistently reconstructed \"limes\" fort, it is also the only one to have had its vicus (adjacent civilian settlement) partially excavated and preserved. The parts of the vicus visible today are located mostly to the south of the fort, on both sides of the road that linked it with Nida, the regional capital and base of further garrison behind the border.\n\nThe village begins immediately outside the main gate, where the ruins of a mansio (an official hostel) and, behind it, of a bath for the soldiers were found. These are followed along the road by the preserved basements and foundations (partially reconstructed) of residential houses and of - as believed in the time of the excavations - a mithraeum, a shrine to the Mithras, a deity popular among the Roman army.\n\nThe fort's bath was relatively large and quite elaborately designed to have all the main features of Roman Thermae. It has an \"apodyterium\" (changing room), a \"frigidarium\" (cold bath), two \"tepidaria\" (lukewarm baths', a \"caldarium\" (hot bath) and a \"sudatorium\" (sauna). The complex was heated from the \"praefurnia\" (firing places); and all rooms except the \"apodyterium\" and \"frigidarium\" were served by a hypocaust system (underfloor and wall heating).\n\nArchaeologists assume that the overall complex (fort and vicus) housed a population of up to 2,000 (500 soldiers, 1,500 civilians).\n\nAlthough the Saalburg is known mainly as an archaeological park and museum, it also serves a number of scientific functions less obvious to the visitor.\n\nThe most striking features for the modern visitor are the fully reconstructed walls and gates, the \"principia\" with its \"aedes\" (shrine containing the \"signa militaria\" or standards), the assembly hall, the \"horreum\" (provisions store), the two barracks buildings with their rebuilt interior \"contubernia\" and the partially reconstructed \"praetorium\".\n\nThe \"horreum\" contains an informative exhibition, focusing on cultural, historical, architectural, and military aspects of Roman Germania. The museum exhibits a large collection of well-preserved military and domestic equipment from the Saalburg and other sites in the area as well as a series of architectural and terrain models.\n\nSince its reconstruction, the Saalburg has functioned also as an internationally renowned centre of research, concerned with provincial Roman archaeology in general, the \"limes\" in particular. The heart of the centre is a specialised library of 30,000 volumes and 2,200 slides. The \"Saalburgmuseum\" regularly organises colloquia and has its own series of academic publications.\n\nSince the 1980s, the Saalburg is also the venue of occasional classical concerts.\n\nOnly about 200 m north of the \"porta decumana\" (back gate), the \"limes\" runs by in a west-easterly direction. Part of the border defense (ditch, bank and palisade) has been reconstructed here.\n\nAs along most of its extent in the Taunus area, the \"limes\" near the Saalburg is remarkably well preserved and can be easily followed through the landscape. Ditch and bank are distinctly visible for long stretches, and many of the former watch towers have been partially preserved or are visible as small mounds. Thus, the Saalburg is a good starting point for further exploration of the \"limes\".\n\nThe Saalburg in the context of the local limes\"\"' between the \"Kleinkastelle\" (small forts) of Heidenstock to the southwest and Lochmühle to the northeast:\n\nNear the Saalburg, a copy of the \"Jupitersäule\" (a type of painted tall sandstone stele dedicated to Jupiter and common in the German provinces) of Mainz has been erected.\n\nThe reerection of the fort in the late 19th and early 20th century led to a surge of interest by the local population, including visitors using the spa at Bad Homburg. To provide comfortable access, the Bad Homburg tram company constructed a direct rail link, the \"Saalburgbahn\". After a pre-World War I flourish, the company was badly affected by post-war inflation and a massive drop of visitor numbers to the spa. Eventually, the service was closed; scanty traces of its embankment and the (closed) station remain.\n\nToday, the fort can be reached by an hourly bus link from Bad Homburg.\n\n\n"}

From late 1998 to early 1999 Kubert drew \"\" #81 - 84, on which he was teamed up with European colorist Richard Isanove, who subsequently followed Kubert to \"Ultimate X-Men\", employing the pencils-to-color approach seen on most of \"Ultimate X-Men\" covers.\n\nIn 2001, Kubert drew the new \"Ultimate X-Men\" title, penciling the first four issues, and then illustrating 16 various issues beginning with #7, before leaving the title with issue #33 (July 2003). In 2004, he began a run on \"Ultimate Fantastic Four\", once again with writers Mark Millar and Brian Michael Bendis, illustrating that series' first six issues, and then issues 13-18.\n\nBoth Adam and his brother Andy signed exclusive contracts with DC Comics in June 2005. Kubert's first project for DC was illustrating \"Last Son\", a Superman story arc co-written by Geoff Johns and Richard Donner, which ran in \"Action Comics\" #844–847, 851 and \"Action Comics Annual\" #11. Further delay forced DC Comics to bring in substitute creative teams and delay the fourth part of the \"Last Son\" storyline and the 3D issue to #851, which was released in early July 2007. The final part of the storyline was in \"Action Comics Annual\" #11. Following his work on Superman he penciled the \"Final Crisis\" tie-in, \"DC Universe: Last Will and Testament\", written by Brad Meltzer.\n\nHis last work for his latest tenure at DC was the \"Batman and The Outsiders Special,\" released in February 2009. This issue, written by Peter Tomasi, highlighted Alfred Pennyworth's efforts to recruit a new team of Outsiders in the wake of Batman's apparent death. After the release of the comic book, Kubert said he was pleased with his work at DC and had done, \"what [he] set out to do,\" which was to draw Superman.\n\nMay 2009 marked Adam Kubert's return to Marvel, his first interior work being published as one of two stories in \"Wolverine\" #73 and 74. Following this he contributed several covers to \"New Mutants\" and \"Wolverine: Weapon X\", and penciled the \"Dark Reign\" tie in, \"The List: Amazing Spider-Man\".\n\nWhen he returned to penciling for Marvel, he continued to do some work for DC, contributing the stories for the \"Wednesday Comics\" \"Sgt. Rock\" feature, drawn by his father. He has since stated that he is Marvel-exclusive, but they are allowed him to work on the \"Sgt. Rock\" feature as he had signed on to do it before his contract at DC had expired. Kubert's next job was providing pencils on \"Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine\". In 2012, Kubert penciled issues #8–10 and #12 of the Marvel crossover miniseries \"Avengers vs. X-Men\". He then drew issues #4–6 of Jonathan Hickman's run on \"The Avengers\".\n\nIn June 2017, Kubert began penciling \"Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man\" written by Chip Zdarsky. The revamped title being billed as a “back-to-basics” approach for the character.\n\nKubert and his brother Andy teach at The Kubert School, which was founded by their father, who also taught there before his passing in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He held several administrative positions in government during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt and later became co-editor of the Marxist publication \"Monthly Review\".\n\nA child of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Magdoff grew up in the Bronx. In 1929, at age 15, Magdoff first started reading Karl Marx when he picked up a copy of \"A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\" in a used-book store. \"It blew my mind,\" recalled Magdoff in 2003. \"His view of history was a revelation...that got me started reading about economics. We were going into the Depression then and I wanted to figure out what it all meant.\" His interest in Marx led him to embrace socialism.\n\nMagdoff studied mathematics and physics from 1930 to 1933 at the City College of New York taking engineering, math and physics courses; he was active in the Social Problems Club with many schoolmates who later joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, a Comintern organization that fought in the Spanish Civil War, many also joined the US Armed Forces. Magdoff attended New York University after 1933, where he studied economics and statistics, receiving a B.Sc in Economics in 1935. He was suspended and later expelled from City College for activities related to editing \"Frontiers\" (a radical student magazine not sanctioned by the school), including participation in a mock trial of the school's President and its Director.\n\nAfter college, David Weintraub Head of the WPA's National Research Project assisted him to get a job with the Works Progress Administration measuring the productivity of various manufacturing industries. By 1940 Magdoff was the WPA's Principal Statistician. During World War II Magdoff worked on the National Defense and Advisory Board and the War Production Board, in the Statistical and Tools Divisions. He left the Commerce Department at the end of 1946.\n\nMagdoff was happy to leave his position with the United States Department of Commerce, on December 30, 1946, and went to work for the New Council on American Business in New York until 1948, at which time he began employment with Trubeck Laboratories in New Jersey.\n\nHe was an economic adviser and speechwriter to former Vice-President and then unsuccessful Presidential candidate Henry Wallace, who ran as the Progressive Party candidate in 1948. Unable to be reemployed in government because of security concerns, he found a career in academia beginning in the 1950s.\n\nAfter the Cuban Revolution, Magdoff had an opportunity to travel to Cuba and have an all night meeting with Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara, whom he later described as a \"sweet and polite man\". This long brainstorming session on the potential obstacles the new revolution would face, sparked a mutual camaraderie that led to Magdoff also meeting with Guevara during his 1964 visit to the United Nations in New York City.\n\nOne of his most famous works, \"The Age of Imperialism\", his first and arguably most influential book, came out in 1969. The book sold over 100,000 copies and was translated into fifteen languages. Two years later after the death of Leo Huberman, Magdoff began co-editing the \"Monthly Review\" with Paul Sweezy, and continued to edit the magazine into his 90th year. Magdoff and Sweezy together produced five books, as well as many years of \"Monthly Review\". One of Magdoff's last books was \"Imperialism without Colonies\", published at age 89. \"Monthly Review\" is one of the preeminent socialist journals in the world, a journal characterized by its independent, nonsectarian Marxist approach.\n\nUnder Magdoff's direction, the \"Monthly Review\" focused more and more upon imperialism as the key unit of analysis for global development and the forces challenging neocolonialism in the Third World. This perspective put the magazine and its press squarely on the New Left intellectual agenda since the late 1960s. His work also kept him in the forefront of socialist thought in the U.S. from the 1930s to this day. The Great Depression left a strong impact on Magdoff's perspective on capitalism, as Magdoff recalls a sense of doom felt in the mid-century by pro-capitalists, holding that nothing since 1929 led him to believe that the economy has become immune to cycles of severe crisis. Until his death, Magdoff co-edited the \"Monthly Review\" with John Bellamy Foster.\n\nMagdoff died on New Year's Day, 2006 at age 92. He had two sons, one of whom, Fred Magdoff, is an expert in plant and soil science. His wife of almost 70 years, Beatrice, died in 2002.\n\nMagdoff has been accused by a number of authors as having been complicit in Soviet espionage activity during his time in US government. He was accused of passing information to Soviet intelligence networks in the United States, primarily through what the FBI called the \"Perlo Group.\" Magdoff was never indicted, but after the end of the Cold War, a number of scholars have inspected declassified documents (including those of the Venona project) from U.S. and Soviet archives. They cite these documents to support the claim that Magdoff was involved in espionage. Other authors have taken issue with some of the broader interpretations of such materials which implicate many Americans in espionage for the Soviet Union, and the allegation that Harry Magdoff was an information source for the Soviets is disputed by several academics and historians asserting that Magdoff probably had no malicious intentions and committed no crimes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Under his leadership in 148 BC when still a Praetor the Roman troops twice defeated Andriscus, a self-proclaimed pretender to the Macedonian throne who claimed to be son of Perseus, last king of the Antigonid dynasty. Andriscus had risen against Rome intending to liberate Macedonia with an army recruited from Thrace. Under Metellus' authority Macedonia was reduced and made a Roman province. For that he won his \"agnomen\" and since then introduced the \"Clypeus Macedoniccus\" in his family's medals.\n\nIn 146 BC, he defeated Critolaos of Megalopolis at the Battle of Scarpheia and the Arcadians at Chaeronea but Metellus was then sent to fight in the Achaean War to avenge an insult offered to a Roman Embassy at Corinth. He fought under the command of Consul Lucius Mummius Achaicus whose ultimate victory in the war against the Achaean League delayed Macedonicus from celebrating immediately the honours of the Triumph which his success at the battle of Scarpheia merited. On his return to Italy he received the honour of a Triumph and the title of \"Macedonicus\". He then built at the Campus Martius a Porticus of Cecilius (\"Porticus Caecilii\") which later became the Porticus of Octavia (\"Porticus Octaviae\"). He also built two grandiose temples: one dedicated to Jupiter and the other to Juno. These were the first marble temples in Rome, ornamented with equestrian statues of the various Generals of Alexander brought by him from Greece.\n\nIn 143 BC, when Consul, he campaigned against the Celtiberians in central Hispania during the Numantine War. He defeated one of the Celtiberian tribes, the Arevaci. He did not confront the city of Numantia, which then became the focus of the war and which resisted for ten years.\n\nIn 133 BC, he gave a speech attacking Tiberius Gracchus regarding that tribune's plan to bypass the traditional prerogative of the senate and keep the vast fortune of the recently deceased Attalus III of Pergamon under the control of the Plebeian Assembly. Attalus had bequeathed his kingdom to the people of Rome.\n\nMetellus was elected Censor in 131 BC, boldly pledging to halt the growing degradation of Roman custom. In a speech which he delivered at his appointment, he proposed that matrimony was to be mandatory for all citizens, in order to put an end to the libertine behaviour then already widespread. A century later Augustus caused this speech to be read at the Senate and published as an Edict for the knowledge and regeneration of the Roman People. His moralizing efforts awakened strong popular opposition, led by the Tribune Gaius Atinius Labeo Macerio whom he had previously expelled from the Senate. He was almost killed by the mob on the Tarpeian Rock.\n\nLater there were some disagreements between him and Scipio Aemilianus, but he never lost sight of the merit of this adversary, whose death he mourned, ordering his sons to transport Aemilianus' body to the crematory pyre.\n\nCelebrated for his eloquence and his taste for the Arts, he died in 116 BC/115 BC. He was generally respected as the paradigm of the fortunate Roman for from an illustrious birth he united all manner of civil and military honours, and left a large family of four sons, of whom one was then Consul, two had already been and one would be soon. His two sons-in-law, Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio and Gaius Servilius Vatia would also attain the consulship.\n\nHe was the father of: \n\nMetellus was played by Gordon Mitchell in the 1961 film \"The Centurion\".\n\n\"Metellus raising the siege\", a painting by Armand-Charles Caraffe, commemorates the legend of Metellus lifting the siege of Centobrigia in 142 BC, in order to spare the lives of innocents.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2003122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003122", "title": "Ice field", "text": "Ice field\n\nAn ice field (also spelled icefield) is a large area of interconnected glaciers, usually found in a mountainous region. They are often found in the colder climates and higher altitudes of the world where there is sufficient precipitation for them to form. The higher peaks of the underlying mountain rock that protrude through the icefields are known as nunataks. Ice fields are larger than alpine glaciers, but smaller than ice caps and ice sheets. The topography of ice fields is determined by the shape of the surrounding landforms, while ice caps have their own forms overriding underlying shapes.\n\nIce fields are formed by a large accumulation of snow which, through years of compression and freezing, turns into ice. Due to ice’s susceptibility to gravity, ice fields usually form over large areas that are basins or atop plateaus, thus allowing a continuum of ice to form over the landscape uninterrupted by glacial channels. Glaciers often form on the edges of ice fields, serving as gravity-propelled drains off the ice field which is in turn replenished by snowfall. \n\nWhile an ice cap is not constrained by topography, an ice field is. An ice field is also distinguishable from an ice cap because it does not have a dome-like form.\n\nThere are several ice fields in the Himalayas and Altay Mountains (the border range between the Central Asian Republics and China). One unexpected ice field is located in Yolyn Am, a mountain valley located in the northern end of the Gobi Desert.\n\nThere are no ice fields in Australia.\n\nNew Zealand has \n\nReference:\n\nThe only large ice fields in mainland Europe are in Norway (e.g., Dovre and Jotunheimen). There are several dozen small ice fields in the Alps and tiny remnants of permanent ice in Sweden, the Apennines, the Pyrenees and the Balkans. Since the disappearance of the last remaining ice field in Andalucía, with the disappearance of the Corral del Veleta glacier in 1913, the southernmost surviving permanent ice field in continental Europe is Snezhnika in Bulgaria.\n\nBeyond the mainland of continental Europe, there are substantial ice fields in Iceland, Svalbard and Franz-Josef Land and smaller surviving ice fields on Jan Mayen and Novaya Zemlya.\n\nOne of the more celebrated North American ice fields is the Columbia Icefield located in the Rocky Mountains between Jasper and Banff, Alberta. Easy access by road contributes to the status of this ice field as one of the most visited in North America, although it is actually a comparatively small ice field within the huge and largely ice-free American cordillera. \n\nMany particularly expansive ice fields lie in the Coast Mountains, Alaska Range, and Chugach Mountains of Alaska, British Columbia, and the Yukon Territory. The 6,500 km² Stikine Icecap (located between the Stikine and Taku Rivers) and the 2,500 km² Juneau Icefield (located between Lynn Canal and the Taku River) both straddle the British Columbian-Alaskan border. Farther north, the Kluane Icecap — which feeds the immense Malaspina and Hubbard Glaciers as well as the Bagley Icefield — sits upon the British Columbia-Yukon Territory-Alaska border and surrounds most of the Saint Elias Mountains as well as both Mount Saint Elias and Mount Logan; it extends as far west as the Copper River.\n\nThere are also large ice fields located in the Kenai Peninsula-Chugach Mountains area, such as the Sargent Icefield and the Harding Icefield. Throughout the Alaska Range there also large icefields (including one surrounding Denali) which are mostly unnamed.\n\nIn South America, there are two main ice fields, \"Campo de Hielo Norte\" (translates to Northern Ice Field or Northern Patagonian Ice Field), in Chile, and \"Campo de Hielo Sur\" (translates to Southern Ice Field or Southern Patagonian Ice Field), shared by Chile and Argentina. There is also a small ice field on the western (Chilean) portion of Tierra del Fuego proper.\n\n"}
{"id": "2003129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003129", "title": "Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius", "text": "Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius\n\nQuintus Caecilius Metellus Pius (c. 130 BC–63 BC) was a Roman politician and general. Like the other members of the influential Caecilii Metelli family, he was a leader of the Optimates, the conservative faction opposed to the Populares during the last century of the Roman Republic. \n\nHis father Metellus Numidicus was banished from Rome through the machinations of Gaius Marius and the Populares. The son, because of his constant and unbending attempts to have his father officially recalled from exile, was given the agnomen (nickname) \"Pius\" . \n\nDuring the Civil Wars (88–80 BC) Pius sided with Lucius Cornelius Sulla and the Optimates. He successfully commanded Sulla’s forces in the northern theatre (northern Italy and Cisalpine Gaul). In 81 BC he became Pontifex Maximus, then consul the following year alongside Sulla. As proconsul Pius fought against Sertorius (a former supporter of Marius) on the Iberian Peninsula; in the so-called Sertorian War. He served alongside Pompey slowly grinding down the rebels 79-72/71 BC. For his victories during the Sertorian War he was granted a Triumph.\n\nMetellus Pius, a member of the distinguished plebeian \"gens Caecilia\" was the son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus, who was consul in 109 BC. His career began in that same year, when he accompanied his father to Numidia as his \"contubernalis\" (cadet) during the Jugurthine War, returning to Rome in 107 BC, when his father was forcibly recalled by the actions of Gaius Marius. In 100 BC, after his father was banished as a result of the political manoeuvrings of Gaius Marius and Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, Metellus Pius launched a campaign to have his father brought back from exile. He produced a petition in 99 BC to this effect, and his constant pleading on the subject resulted in Quintus Calidius, the Plebeian Tribune of 98 BC passing a law which allowed his father to return. As a result of his fidelity, he was given the agnomen “Pius” for the constancy and inflexibility with which he fought for his father's political rehabilitation and return to Rome.\n\nSometime during 90s BC, Metellus Pius was elected to the College of Pontiffs as a result of his family's eminence and influence. The outbreak of the Social War saw him employed as a legate in late 89 BC, probably serving the consul Pompeius Strabo in the northern theatre; he won some battles against the Marsi. As a result of these victories, he was elected praetor in the following year (88 BC). During his praetorship, he was tasked with enrolling the Italian allies as new Roman citizens within sixty days, in accordance with the \"Lex Plautia Papiria\". Once this was completed, Metellus Pius returned to the front, he replaced the legate Gaius Cosconius on the southern front. He harassed the territory around Apulia, captured the town of Venusia, and defeated the rebel leader, Quintus Poppaedius Silo, who died during the storming of Venusia. Cicero, at the time a young man, remembered hearing Metellus speak at \"contiones\" in Rome during this period, most likely during his Metellus's praetorship. Cicero remarked of Metellus' ability: 'although no real orator, he was nonetheless not without some capacity for public speech'.\n\nIn 88 BC, after being sidelined by his political opponents, Sulla marched his legions on Rome and took the capital. He took revenge on his enemies and forced Marius into exile. Sulla then left Italy and went east to fight in the First Mithridatic War against Mithridates VI of Pontus. In 87 BC, Metellus Pius’ command was extended, with his appointment as propraetor, responsible for continuing the war against Samnium. Later that year, however, saw a dispute between the two consuls Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gnaeus Octavius flare up into war. Cinna, expelled from Rome, met up with the exiled Gaius Marius, and their ally Quintus Sertorius they marched on Rome and laid siege to the city. During the early phase of this conflict, the Senate, fearing that they may need additional troops and commanders, ordered Metellus Pius to negotiate a peace with the Samnites.\n\nMarching to Rome, he made camp at the Alban Hills, accompanied by Publius Licinius Crassus. Here he met up with Gnaeus Octavius, who had abandoned Rome, but both men soon fell out with each other, over Metellus Pius’ troops demanding that their commander take over overall command from Gnaeus Octavius. The Senate then asked him to negotiate with Cinna on their behalf, during which time he recognized Cinna as the legitimate consul. However, with Cinna's occupation of Rome and the executions initiated by Gaius Marius, Metellus Pius decided to abandon Rome and head to North Africa.\n\nArriving in Africa by early 86 BC, Metellus Pius started raising an army from his private clients, with the intent of joining Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who had been the principal opponent of Cinna and Marius. He was joined by Marcus Licinius Crassus, but both men fell out, and Crassus was forced to leave and eventually join up with Sulla in Greece. Metellus acted as propraetorian governor of the province, but this was unrecognized by Cinna and his regime at Rome. Nevertheless, it wasn't until 84 BC that the Marians at Rome were able to send out their own governor, Gaius Fabius Hadrianus. Upon his arrival, he drove out Metellus Pius who fled to Numidia; pursued here, he and the Numidian king Hiempsal II were forced to flee onwards to Mauretania. From here, Metellus Pius made his way to Liguria (in North-Western Italy) by late 84 BC or early 83 BC.\n\nBy 83 BC, Sulla had returned from the east and was marching slowly to Rome for his confrontation with the Marian regime. Moving quickly, Metellus Pius was the first to meet him along the Via Appia, bringing new troops with him. He, like many of the aristocracy, only joined Sulla when it was prudent to do so, and not because they approved of his measures, such as his first march on Rome. Regardless, recognizing Metellus as possessing propraetorian imperium and his influence as a member of the powerful Metellan faction, Sulla made him his principal subordinate. By July 83 BC, the Senate, under the direction of the consul Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, declared Metellus Pius a public enemy.\n\nIn 82 BC, Sulla sent him to secure the northern parts of Italy, he was accompanied by young Pompey Magnus, Marcus Crassus and Marcus Lucullus. Metellus attacked and defeated Gaius Carrinas in Picenum. He then achieved a victory over the consul Gaius Papirius Carbo and his general Gaius Norbanus at Faventia, pacifying Cisalpine Gaul for Sulla. With Sulla's victory in 82 BC, he began rewarding his supporters, and made Metellus Pius the Pontifex Maximus in 81 BC, following the murder of Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex. He was also a Monetalis from 82 BC to 80 BC.\n\nDuring this entire period, he was shown to be one of Sulla's best subordinates. An optimate and traditionalist he was a natural supporter of the Senate's prerogatives, he had no other objective apart from fighting the populism of Marius and Cinna, and did not participate in the atrocious violence during the reign of the dictatorship of Sulla. Finally in 80 BC, he was appointed consul alongside Sulla. Metellus Pius used his position to reward Quintus Calidius, who had helped bring his father back, by supporting his bid for the praetorship.\n\nSometime during his consulship, Quintus Sertorius, an opponent of Sulla, established himself in Spain and began a rebellion against the Senate. In 80 BC, after Sertorius had defeated Fufidius, the governor of Hispania Ulterior, the Senate decided to send Metellus Pius once his term as consul had ended. Upgrading Hispania Ulterior to a consular province, they dispatched Metellus Pius to take charge of the war against Sertorius. Arriving in Spain in 79 BC Metellus Pius established his bases at \"Metellinum\" (today Medellín), \"Castra Caecilia\" (today Cáceres), \"Viccus Caecilius\", at the Sierra de Gredos, and at \"Caeciliana\", near Setúbal.\n\nFrom the start, it was clear that Metellus Pius was outclassed by the brilliant Sertorius suffering repeated defeats through Sertorius’ use of guerrilla tactics. His legate Thorius (probably Lucius Thorius Balbus) −dispatched to come to the assistance of the governor of Hispania Citerior, Marcus Domitus Calvinus− was defeated by Sertorius (79 BC). After Thorius's defeat Metellus decided to take on Sertorius himself. Metellus was a solid if unspectacular general, under normal circumstances he would have easily trounced his opponent, but now he was pitted against the tactically brilliant Sertorius. Plutarch describes the unequal campaign which followed:\nAfter an unsuccessful push towards the Tagus in 79 BC, and suffering a defeat by Sertorius at Lacobriga in 78 BC, Pius was forced to ask for help from Lucius Manlius, the governor of Gallia Transalpina, but Manlius was defeated by Sertorius's legate Lucius Hirtuleius upon entering the Iberian peninsula and had to retreat. The end result was that an exhausted Pius was pushed out of his province (Hispania Ulterior).\n\nWhen the consuls of 78 BC declined to join Metellus Pius as proconsuls once their terms ended, the Senate in late 77 BC, hearing of Pius’ ongoing reverses at the hands of Sertorius, decided to send Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus with a large army to give Pius what assistance he could, while Pius’ governorship was prorogued. Both men worked well together, but were hard pressed to win any encounter with Sertorius himself. With Pompey's arrival in 76 BC, Sertorius turned his attention to him, inflicting severe losses on the Pompeian army at the Battle of Lauron. Unfortunately for Sertorius, his legates were not able to contain Metellus, and he arrived just in time to save Pompey. Against Sertorius's legates Metellus and Pompey had more success. In 75 BC, Pompey defeated Sertorius's legates Perpenna and Herrenius at the Battle of Valentia while Metellus defeated Hirtuleius at the Battle of Italica.\n\nThe battle was Metellus’ first major victory in the Sertorius War. It freed Metellus’ army from the western theatre and allowed him to march against Sertorius’ rear in the eastern theatre.\nMetellus and Hirtuleius were campaigning near the Roman colony of Italica when Hirtuleius made the mistake of trying to force his opponent into a pitched battle. He mustered his army soon after dawn and marched on Metellus' encampment. Metellus mustered his troops too, but kept them behind his entrenchments until noon. It was extremely hot and Hirtuleius' troops were soon sweltering while Metellus' legionaries remained relatively fresh. Since his enemy remained drawn up in front of his camp for hours, Metellus had plenty of time to study their dispositions and make his own plans accordingly. He had observed that Hirtuleius had posted his strongest units in the centre of his battle-line. \nWhen the battle finally commenced Metellus held back his own centre and concentrated on winning on the flanks. After defeating his opponents flanks he enveloped Hirtuleius centre and slaughtered them. This was the classic tactic used by Hannibal at Cannae almost a century and a half ago. Hirtuleius lost 20,000 men at Italica and fled north to join his commander Sertorius who was squaring off against Pompey.\n\nMetellus came to the aid of Pompey after his near defeat at Sucro. They then followed Sertorius inland to a town called Segontia and finally won a battle against Sertorius himself. Metellus was acclaimed \"imperator\" by his men.\n\nPlutarch remarks that this battle was forced upon Sertorius. This was probably done by his Celt-Iberian troops who wanted to defend Segontia, one of their native towns. The fighting started at noon and lasted well into the night. Sertorius first fought Pompey while his legates Perpenna and Hirtuleius fought Metellus. After Hirtuleius had fallen Sertorius switched places with Perpenna and launched several personally-led attacks on Metellus. Metellus stood his ground and in the course of the fight he was wounded by a spear. This turned out to be a turning point in the battle, for Metellus' men counter-attacked in revenge and pushed back the Iberians.\n\nMetellus then complacently decided to rest his troops and made camp. Sertorius in the meantime had regrouped his men and in the evening launched an unexpected attack on Metellus' camp, and attempted to exploit its vulnerable position by cutting it off with a trench. Unfortunately for the Sertorians, Pompey and his army now showed up and forced them to withdraw. Over the course of the battle Pompey had lost 6,000 men while Sertorius had lost only 3,000, but to offset this Perperna had lost some 5,000 soldiers. Metellus' losses are unknown, but must have been significant as well.\n\nMetellus Pius spent the winter of 75-74 BC in Gaul, where he received two legions in reinforcements. Upon his return to Spain in 74 BC, he captured the towns of Bilbilis and Segobriga, before joining Pompey at the siege of Calagurris. They were forced to raise the siege when Sertorius approached, after which Pius returned to Gaul. He then offered a reward of 100 silver talents and 20,000 acres of land to any Roman who would betray Sertorius. This resulted in Sertorius no longer trusting his Roman bodyguard and exchanged it for a Spanish one. Continued successes during 73 BC saw him ease up and allow Pompey to take the burden of the final phases of the war, with Sertorius’ murder in 72 BC. He imposed new taxes in Hispania Ulterior after the end of Sertorius’ rebellion. Pius’ governorship ended in 71 BC with the end of the war. He disbanded his army after crossing the Alps, and celebrated a triumph together with Pompey on December 30, 71 BC. Regardless of the triumph, during those eight years of resistance he was unable to conclusively defeat Sertorius, and it was only after Sertorius' assassination by his own men that the rebels were forced to cede to the military ability of Metellus Pius.\n\nRegardless of his working relationship with Pompey in Spain, Metellus Pius’ politics meant that he was opposed to Pompey's continued irregular extra-magisterial career throughout the 60s BC. Though Pompey was largely untouchable, senatorial resentment could be visited upon his clients and (former) subordinates. When the former Plebeian tribune and associate of Pompey, Gaius Cornelius, was accused of \"maiestas\", the prosecution called on as witnesses a number of key anti-Pompeian former consuls, including Metellus Pius.\n\nMetellus Pius was a friend and patron of the noted poet Aulus Licinius Archias. Pius died around 63 BC, the year that Julius Caesar replaced him as Pontifex Maximus.\n\nHe married Licinia Crassa Secunda or Minor, daughter of Lucius Licinius Crassus Orator, and wife Mucia Secunda, from whom he had no children. For this reason he adopted his nephew by marriage and son of his second cousin Publius Cornelius Scipio, renamed Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica. He was the son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius's wife's sister Licinia Crassa Prima or Major and Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio, who was in turn the son of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio and Caecilia Metella, daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus.\n\nMetellus Pius is a prominent character in the novels \"The First Man in Rome\", \"The Grass Crown\" and \"Fortune's Favorites\" by Colleen McCullough. In the novels he is characterised as having a stutter, and is referred to by contemporaries, including Sulla, as “the Piglet”.\n\nHe is also mentioned in John Maddox Roberts' SPQR series as the fictional main character Decius Caecilius Metellus' uncle.\n\n\n"}

Originally named Michael, her parents changed the spelling (but retained the pronunciation) so as not to confuse her with a male producer and children's author of the time (Michael Brown).\n\nMiquel is the mother of singer Sinitta and the stepsister of singer Amii Stewart.\n\nShe was born in Montreal on 8 February 1945 and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Miquel gave birth to twins Sinitta and Greta on 19 October 1963 when she was only 18.\n\nShe was prompted to leave university after she auditioned for the U.S. touring company of the musical \"Hair\" and landed the part of Sheila. At the end of the \"Hair\" tour she visited Australia.\n\nIn 1973, she was cast as the lead in \"Decameron '73\" at the Roadhouse in London. She was then interviewed on the \"Michael Parkinson Show\". In 1975 she appeared in the film \"Rollerball\" with James Caan, as well as in the role of Miriam in the television film \"Regan\" in 1974 for the \"Armchair Cinema\" ITV strand, which was effectively the pilot for \"The Sweeney\" TV series. She also held a two-year association with the singing and dancing group 'Second Generation'.\n\nThrough the next two years she performed various parts in \"Bubbling Brown Sugar\" and television appearances in \"Seaside Special\" (on Saturday, 25 June 1977), \"Supersonic\" (on Saturday, 5 March 1977 – show 40), \"The Ronnie Corbett Show\", \"Jack Parnell's Show\", \"Vince Hill's Musical Time Machine\" and Bruce Forsyth's \"Bring on the Girls\".\n\nIn 1976, she played Sister Anna in the musical \"Mardi Gras\" (which opened on 18 March at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London). It was through this that she was discovered and signed for her first record release, \"First Time Around\". This led her to musician Alan Hawkshaw (of Emile Ford and the Checkmates, The Shadows and Love De-Luxe), who signed her for an album deal. The album \"Symphony of Love\" (1978) included the title track, \"Dancin' with the Lights Down Low\", \"This is Something New to Me\", \"The Day They Got Disco in Brazil\", \"Do It\" and \"Something Made of Love\".\n\nAlso in 1978, she appeared in the American film \"Superman\", as the non-speaking eighth reporter in a scene following the first Superman spotting.\n\nIn need of a new producer in the early 1980s, Brown crossed the paths of Ian Levine and Fiachra Trench in 1983. Together with Record Shack Records, they created the album \"Manpower\", a Hi-NRG release. The first single released from the album, \"So Many Men, So Little Time\" reached No. 88 on the UK Singles Chart on 11 June 1983. and peaked at number No. 2 on the club chart.\n\nIn the two years following \"Manpower\", she appeared in stage productions of \"Only in America, the Leiber and Stoller Musical\"; \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\" and \"One Mo' Time\", as well as in numerous international clubs, but did not release any more albums until 1985. \"Close to Perfection\" (also produced by Levine) could not compete with her first success. The album featured two US dance radio and dance chart hits, with \"Black Leather\" and \"Close to Perfection \", the latter of which gave her her highest UK Singles Chart placing (#63) for seven weeks.\n\nIn 1986, she filled in for The Three Degrees singer Helen Scott while Scott was pregnant.

Michael McKean recites the lyrics of the song in the documentary \"\".\n\nThe title of \"I Palindrome I\" came from a demo written by John Flansburgh for They Might Be Giants's telephone service, Dial-A-Song. John Linnell adapted the lyric after attending a reading by the American poet Hal Sirowitz. The song's opening line, \"Someday mother will die and I'll get the money\", is a reference to Sirowitz's portrayal of mother-child relationships. \n\nThe song contains several palindromes and references to the concept of recursion. For example, the lyrics contain the straightforward palindromes \"Egad, a base tone denotes a bad age\" and \"Man o nam\". The middle 8 consists of what critic Stewart Mason calls a \"sentence palindrome\", in which the words (rather than the letters) are the units in a sequence which reads the same backwards and forwards. The lyrics also reference \"a snake head eating the head on the opposite side\" (an ouroboros), which reviewer Ira Robbins interprets as \"a grim life mask [carved] from the conceptual clay of reversible phrases\".\n\n\"I Palindrome I\" received generally positive attention from critics. Writing for Allmusic, Stewart Mason concluded that the song was musically appealing enough to overcome its shallow lyrics, which he felt employed wordplay for its own sake rather than \"in the service of a particular idea or emotion\". In a review of \"Apollo 18\", Karen Schlosberg said that the lyrics of \"I Palindrome I\" sound like \"Edgar Allan Poe and David Lynch meeting the Monkees\", creating an \"unlikely sing-along hook\". In a 2016 \"Gothamist\" retrospective revisiting They Might Be Giants's studio albums, Ken Bays noted \"I Palindrome I\" as a highlight for Linnell's strong vocal performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The full official name of the station is (in English: Constitution Square Station) reflecting the fact that the station is located opposite Constitution Square, two kilometers to the south of the landmark. The ground floor of the station has fourteen tracks and the floor below has two tracks for the Buenos Aires Underground.\n\nOn 7 March 1864, in a ceremony attended by the president Bartolomé Mitre, construction began at Mercado Constitución, on the site of the present day terminus, as the British-owned Buenos Aires Great Southern railway company began building its first broad gauge line of 114 km as far as Chascomús. The first section of the line to Jeppener, Buenos Aires, was opened on 14 August 1865; during that same month a small terminal station at Mercado Constitución was opened to the public and renamed Plaza Constitución. Later that year in December the line to Chascomús was opened.\nBetween 1885 and 1887 the Plaza Constitución terminus was rebuilt and enlarged and between 1906 and 1907 further building work was carried out and extra platforms were added to cope with the increasing suburban traffic. In 1912 yet more platforms were added.\n\nOn 19 September 1925 a foundation stone for the present day terminus was laid by the Prince of Wales, later Duke of Windsor, during his official visit to Argentina. The original station was then rebuilt with fourteen platforms roofed over, modern hydraulic buffer stops and an imposing concourse which formed a massive main hall, one of the largest in the world, along the entire length of the site. Of the fourteen platforms, only two or three were normally used for mainline trains, leaving the rest for suburban services. To the east of the main station a large goods and parcels section with warehouses, offices and several sidings was built. The street frontage of the original station was left untouched due to financial constraints imposed towards the end of the rebuilding.\n\nThe station was the site of a riot on May 16, 2007, during the evening rush hour, which provoked debate and discussion in Argentina about railway privatisation. A crowded train broke down within walking distance of the station blocking the railway and the irate passengers from trains trapped at the station, after waiting for the train to be fixed and to move, walked to the platform, thus triggering the chaos. Around 25 people were injured, and a total of 16 were arrested and later released.\n\nAll southbound trains on the Roca Line have their terminus at Constitución and the station is served by Trenes Argentinos, the national train operator which provides commuter services through the Roca Line to the nearby city of La Plata and to the surrounding suburbs of Buenos Aires.\n\nTrenes Argentinos also operates long-distance services throughout much of Buenos Aires Province on the General Roca Railway, formerly operated by defunct company Ferrobaires. Major destinations include Mar del Plata, Miramar, and Bahía Blanca, with connecting services further south to Carmen de Patagones.\n\nConstitución is accessible by the Line C of the Buenos Aires Underground and by numerous public bus services (including the colectivo 60 service), and by long-distance bus services. From 1944 to 1966, it was also served by Line E with a station there, however this was closed when the line was re-routed further towards the centre of the city. In the future, the station will also serve as the terminus for Line F which began construction in 2015.\n\nThe surrounding neighbourhood - part of Neighbourhood of Constitución - is characterised by low-rent residences for people from the provinces (or from neighbouring Paraguay and Bolivia) who come to work in the city.\n\n\n\n"}

He played college football at Arizona State, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American. He was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens tenth overall in the 2003 NFL Draft, and is the franchise's all-time leader in sacks. He also had short stints with the Arizona Cardinals and Kansas City Chiefs during the 2019 season.\n\nSuggs is a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, a two time All-Pro, and was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2011. Suggs has won two Super Bowls in his career, Super Bowl XLVII with the Ravens in 2012 and Super Bowl LIV in 2019 with the Chiefs. As of the conclusion of the 2019 NFL season, Suggs ranked 8th all-time in career sacks in NFL history with 139. He is one of only two active players remaining from the 2003 Draft, the other being Jason Witten.\n\nSuggs was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Laverne Diane (née Kennedy) and Donald Lee Suggs. He was raised in St. Paul, Minnesota. While growing up in Saint Paul, he played youth football, as a center, with future major league MVP baseball player Joe Mauer as quarterback. Suggs moved to Arizona after the eighth grade. \nAs a teenager, he attended multiple schools, the first being Chandler High School. He later transferred to Hamilton High School where he set the Arizona Class 5A record for rushing yards in a game with 367 against Yuma Kofa as a junior in 1999.\n\nAs a senior, Suggs was named a \"Parade\" high school All-American in 2000, Gatorade Arizona Player of the Year, the No. 1 jumbo athlete in the nation by \"SuperPrep Magazine\", Arizona Player of the Year by USA Today as well as an All-American by \"USA Today\" and the 60th-best player in the nation by \"Sporting News\".\n\nIn addition to football, Suggs lettered three times in basketball and once in track and field.\n\nSuggs decided to attend Arizona State University, where he played defensive end for coach Bruce Snyder and coach Dirk Koetter's Arizona State Sun Devils football teams from 2000 to 2002. He finished his career with 163 tackles, including a school, career-record 65.5 tackles for losses, and 44 quarterback sacks, 14 forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, two interceptions, and nine passes deflected. He set an NCAA single-season record with 24 sacks in 2002. Following his 2002 junior season, he was a first-team All-Pac-10 selection and the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year, and was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American.\n\nSuggs was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round with the 10th overall pick in the 2003 NFL Draft, becoming one of the youngest defensive players ever drafted at only 20 years old until defensive tackle Amobi Okoye was drafted by the Houston Texans at the age of 19 in 2007.\n\nSuggs enjoyed immediate success as a rookie in 2003 as he tied an NFL record by posting a sack in each of his first four games. He finished the season with 27 tackles (19 solo), 12 sacks (a Ravens franchise rookie record), 6 forced fumbles, 2 pass deflections, and 1 interception, earning him Defensive Rookie of the Year honors while only starting one game that year.\n\nIn 2004, Suggs was elected to his first Pro Bowl as he recorded 10.5 sacks and 60 tackles (45 solo).\n\nIn 2005, the Ravens' new defensive co-ordinator Rex Ryan, son of famous defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, moved Suggs from outside linebacker to defensive end in many of the defensive schemes. Despite registering a then-career-low eight sacks, Suggs also set new career-highs in tackles with 69 (46 solo) and interceptions with two.\nIn 2006, Suggs was part of the NFL's best overall defense, the unit allowing a league-low 12.6 points per game. He recorded 64 tackles (46 solo), 9.5 sacks, and set a new career-high in pass deflections with eight. After the season, he was voted to the Pro Bowl for the second time. He was a major contributor as the Ravens went 13–3. For the season, Suggs started nine games at right defensive end in the Ravens base 4-3 and seven games at outside linebacker when the Ravens started game in a base 3-4 defense. Suggs also earned attention for his flashy playing style, \"Suggs evolved into one of the league's best pass-rushers whether he is blitzing as a linebacker or rushing from defensive end with one hand on the ground.\"\nThe following season in 2007, Suggs made 80 tackles (52 solo) and five sacks, as he and the Ravens plummeted to 5-11. Like the season before, Suggs was a hybrid defensive end/linebacker, playing 50 percent of the defensive snaps at defensive end in the Ravens base 4-3 defense.\nOn February 19, 2008, the Ravens placed the franchise tag on Suggs. He initially filed a grievance because the team had designated him as a LB with the franchise tag rather than a DE, which resulted in a monetary difference of about $800,000. Despite being unhappy with the franchise tag, Suggs reported to off-season mini-camps to practice with the team. On May 13, 2008, he reached an agreement with the team to split the difference in the franchise tag amounts of a LB and a DE and drop his grievance.\nIn Week 7 of the 2008 NFL season, Suggs intercepted a pass from Chad Pennington of the Miami Dolphins and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown, the first pick six of his professional career. Two weeks later, he intercepted Derek Anderson of the Cleveland Browns for a game-sealing touchdown. At season's end, he was named to his third Pro Bowl after producing 68 tackles (53 solo), 2 forced fumbles and 8 sacks to go along with the 2 interceptions, a new career-high 9 pass break-ups and 2 touchdowns. During the 2008–09 NFL playoffs, Suggs recorded sacks in all three of the Ravens' post-season games, including two in the AFC Championship game against Ben Roethlisberger and the division-winning Pittsburgh Steelers, whom Suggs had sacked often over the years.\n\nOn February 18, 2009, he was once again given the Ravens' franchise tag. On July 15, 2009, the Ravens signed him to a 6-year, $62.5 million contract. His bonus money ($33.1 million) made him the highest paid linebacker in NFL history.\n\nThe 2009 season was not as productive for Suggs as he recorded a career-low in sacks with 4.5. Playing above his normal playing weight, he also missed the first three games of his career due to injury after quarterback Brady Quinn dove at his legs after cornerback Chris Carr intercepted a pass. In the wild Card playoff game against the New England Patriots, Suggs sacked and forced a Tom Brady fumble before recovering the ball on the Patriots' opening drive, helping the Ravens ultimately win 33–14.\n\nIn 2010, Suggs compiled 68 tackles (53 solo), 11.5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles and 2 pass deflections. In the play-off win over the Kansas City Chiefs in the wild-card round, he made 4 tackles (all solo) and two sacks. Against the Steelers in the divisional playoff round, he recorded six tackles (5 solo), a career-high three sacks, and a forced fumble that was recovered and returned for a touchdown by fellow defensive end Cory Redding.\n\nOn the NFL's first of the annual Top 100 Players list, Suggs came in at #40. 2011 saw Suggs have the best season of his career, which started with a Defensive Player of the Week-winning performance against the Steelers. In a 35-7 blowout, Suggs recorded three sacks and two forced fumbles, contributing heavily to the defense's seven turnovers.\n\nSuggs would have two more games that season with three sacks, the second on Thanksgiving in a 16–6 win over the NFC's number-two-seeded San Francisco 49ers and the third in a 24–10 win over a hapless Colts team (he also had three forced fumbles in the latter). He finished the season with career highs in sacks (14) and forced fumbles (7), tied his career high for interceptions (2), and also had 50 total tackles and six passes defended. He was named to his fifth Pro Bowl and first All-Pro first team.\n\nThe Ravens entered the playoffs with a 12–4 record and the number-two seed in the AFC. They had their season ended by the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a dropped touchdown by Lee Evans and a notorious missed field goal by Billy Cundiff. On February 4, 2012, Suggs was named the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the 2011 season, Suggs was named #11 on the NFL Top 100 list for 2012. During the 2012 offseason, Suggs tore his Achilles tendon allegedly while playing basketball; though Suggs and his agent have claimed that he was hurt while doing conditioning workouts. Owner Steve Bisciotti stated that it was no concern where he hurt it and the Ravens will not try to avoid paying him his contract. Some medical experts believed that Suggs' injury should have forced him to miss the 2012 season, however Suggs claimed he would return by November 2012. On October 20, 2012, Suggs was removed from the physically unable to perform (PUP) list, allowing him to play the next day against the Houston Texans. Suggs has been the first player in the NFL to recover so quickly from such serious injury. Suggs' return surprised many, as he finished the game with 4 tackles (3 solo), 1 pass defended, and 1 sack, less than 5 and a half months after having Achilles tendon surgery.\n\nSuggs was key in the Ravens win over the Denver Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs with two sacks on Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, after which, the Ravens advanced to New England in a rematch of the previous year's AFC Championship Game where they defeated the New England Patriots by a score of 28–13. The win gave Suggs his first ever AFC Championship and his first appearance in the Super Bowl, being Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers. In that game, the Ravens won 34–31, earning Suggs his first Super Bowl ring.\n\nSuggs made the Top 100 Players list for the third straight year, in 2013, being ranked at #56. Within 12 weeks into the season, Suggs had registered nine sacks and one fumble recovery. Overall in 2013, Suggs started all 16 games with 80 tackles, a fumble recovery, and 10 sacks. For his successful 2013 season, Suggs was elected to participate in the Pro Bowl for his sixth such nomination.\n\nSuggs made the NFL Top 100 Players list again in 2014, as he was ranked #26. Suggs recorded his first sack of the season against Panthers quarterback Cam Newton (it was a half-sack). In Weeks 6–8, he had one sack in each game In Week 7, the sack he recorded on Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan was for a safety, and he also recovered a fumble.\n\nFrom Weeks 10-17 (other than the Week 11 bye week), Suggs recorded at least one sack in each game, with the one exception being the Week 16 loss to the Houston Texans (a game in which the Ravens had no sacks as a whole). In Week 10, Suggs had 1.5 sacks on rookie quarterback Zach Mettenberger. Two weeks later, in a Monday Night Football matchup against the New Orleans Saints, Suggs accounted for a sack against Saints quarterback Drew Brees. With the hit, Suggs became the 31st player in NFL history to register over 100 sacks, and the first member of the Baltimore Ravens to achieve such a milestone.\n\nIn the Ravens' season finale, Suggs recorded a sack, a defended pass and a fumble recovery, all on Browns first-time-starting quarterback Connor Shaw. The Ravens clinched a Wild Card spot in the playoffs that day. Suggs finished the year with 12 sacks, a pass defended, a fumble recovery, and a safety. He and Elvis Dumervil led the league in sacks by a pair with 29 (Dumervil led the Ravens with 17).\n\nIn the Wild Card Round of the playoffs, Suggs intercepted a pass from Ben Roethlisberger in the fourth quarter. The ball bounced off the hands of running back Ben Tate, the intended receiver on the play, and landed between a diving Suggs's legs. The Ravens won this game 30–17 and moved onto the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions.\n\nFor the fifth straight year, Suggs made the Top 100 Players list at #84. As of 2018, this is his most recent appearance on the list. In the season opener against the Denver Broncos on September 13, 2015, Suggs suffered an achilles injury and left the game. Hours later, an MRI revealed that his achilles was torn, which prematurely ended his 2015 season.\n\nIn the 2016 season, Suggs appeared in 15 games. He recorded 8.0 sacks, 28 tackles, seven assisted tackles, four passes defended, and three forced fumbles.\n\nIn the 2017 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals, Suggs recorded two sacks and forced a fumble off of quarterback Andy Dalton in the third quarter of the 20–0 victory. The fumble, which was recovered by teammate Michael Pierce, occurred in the Ravens' red zone and helped preserve the eventual shutout victory. In Week 2, against the Cleveland Browns, he forced a fumble off DeShone Kizer, which help set up the Ravens' offense on an eventual touchdown scoring drive in the 24–10 victory. In weeks 11 and 12, he had two sacks in each game, helping the Ravens win back-to-back times. On December 19, 2017, Suggs was named to his seventh Pro Bowl.\n\nThe Ravens finished the season with a 9–7 record, but missed the playoffs due to blowing the lead in the last fifty seconds of the fourth quarter in their season finale against the Bengals. Suggs missed out on 2018's Top 100 list again, but was honorably ranked at 104 in the list of the top ten players who didn't make the cut.\n\nIn 2018, Suggs finished tied for second on the team with seven sacks, along with 34 combined tackles, six passes defended, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery he returned for a touchdown in Week 12 against the Oakland Raiders.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, Suggs signed a one-year, $7 million deal with the Arizona Cardinals.\nSuggs made his debut with the Cardinals in Week 1 against the Detroit Lions. In the game, Suggs sacked Matthew Stafford twice in the 27–27 tie. Week 2 of the 2019 season saw Suggs return to Baltimore for the first time in an opposing team's jersey. As Suggs ran onto the field he received a standing ovation from Ravens fans. He had one solo tackle during the Cardinals' 23–17 loss.\nIn week 4 against the Seattle Seahawks, Suggs sacked Russell Wilson 1.5 times in the 27–10 loss. On December 13, 2019, Suggs was released by the Cardinals.\n\nOn December 16, 2019, Suggs was claimed off waivers by the Kansas City Chiefs. He won his second ring in Super Bowl LIV, where the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 31–20. In addition, Suggs moved to the Defensive End position in the 4-3 defense.\n\nIn December 2003, Suggs was charged with felony aggravated assault stemming from a March 2003 incident in Arizona, in which it was alleged that a verbal altercation after a basketball tournament led to Suggs assaulting a man with a piece of reinforcement rod. Apparently the parties had a disagreement during the tournament, and it was claimed that Suggs swung at the victim and broke his nose and cheekbone. In June 2005, however, Suggs was acquitted of the charges, with a juror commenting that guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was not established.\n\nA series of allegations were made by his girlfriend, Candace Williams; in 2009 she alleged he threw a soap dispenser at her head, struck her in the chest with his hand and held a bottle of bleach over her and their 1-year-old son. No criminal charges were filed against Suggs, however, and Williams' subsequent lawsuit was dismissed. In September 2012, he was accused of punching and dragging his girlfriend Candace Williams beside his car while his two children were inside. A temporary protective order was placed against Suggs, who was required to surrender his seven firearms, which included an AK-47, and a judge dismissed the order on December 12. Despite Suggs's rocky relationship with Williams, the two married on December 14, 2012, and the protective order was removed. The couple have two children together. His wife filed for divorce in 2015.\n\nSuggs guest starred in Season 2 of the popular HBO series \"Ballers\".\n\nSuggs considers himself half-Jewish, and his paternal grandfather was Jewish. He has had a Jewish star tattooed on his right arm since 2009, which he says he got \"to remind me of who I am,\" and wears a Star of David necklace. Suggs wore a Star of David on his cleats during a game in October 2019 to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the deadly Tree of Life*Or L’Simcha Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh.\n\n\n"}

However, when Heyward's recent ex-girlfriend Dolores Gonzalez (Cecilia Callejo) makes a public nuisance of herself over their relationship, a drunk Heyward goes to see her. It is a setup. Dolores is being held at gunpoint by a man, and when Heyward enters her apartment, the mystery man kills Dolores and frames Heyward for the murder. The only clue is a half of a dime incorporated into a piece of jewelry that the victim managed to snatch from her assailant. Guy hurries to the scene soon after and hides his client so he can catch the real killer, but both of them are nabbed by the police, tried, convicted and sentenced: Guy to prison for a year, Heyward to be executed.\n\nIt is revealed to the audience that Heyward's new wife Vivian (Frances Drake) and her lover, Al Mallon (Sidney Blackmer), are behind the whole thing.

Following these and other shows, Belladonna returned to the studio with the band to record new vocals for their long-awaited album \"Worship Music\".\n\nSince his return, Anthrax has been nominated for 3 additional Grammy awards.\n\nAfter his departure from Anthrax in 1992, Belladonna continued to make music in Belladonna, a solo project of which he has been the only consistent member.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Belladonna released its self-titled debut album, which was well received by both critics and fans alike. The second album, \"Spells of Fear\", was released in 1998 and was heavily criticized for bad production and poor musicianship. Demo recordings of a third album, which was never professionally mastered, was self-released by the band in 2003. It was a return to better songwriting and musicianship and like the debut album it was well received by the fans.\n\nWhen asked whether he plans to release any more solo material in the future despite having re-joined Anthrax as a full-time member, Belladonna responded with: \"Yeah definitely. I’m working on some stuff and I have almost a full record worth of material sitting right here which is very well demoed up but it is still far from done in its own way. I just keep running out of time whether someone’s schedule is messed up or whatever it is happening at the time and it’s unfortunate. Now of course Anthrax is back on the go so I just don’t have the time to sit for hours with the material but there is definitely some cool metal here. By the time I get to do these songs I’ll probably have a fresh batch of ideas and songs to put on top of those. (...) I’d like to put another record out some day, put something out that I can again call my own as I have some great ideas.\" \n\nBelladonna also plays drums and sings lead vocals in a cover band named Chief Big Way which features mainly classic rock hits from the 70s and 80s. The band, based around Syracuse, New York, plays small neighborhood bars.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her accomplishments included scaling Mount Everest alone, without supplementary oxygen or support from a Sherpa team, in 1995. She soloed all the great north faces of the Alps in a single season—a first for any climber. This feat included climbing the difficult north face of the Eiger in the Alps, in 1988. Hargreaves also climbed Ama Dablam in Nepal.\n\nIn 1995, Hargreaves intended to climb the three highest mountains in the world—Mount Everest, K2, and Kangchenjunga—unaided. On 13 May 1995, she reached the summit of Everest without the aid of Sherpas or bottled oxygen; on 13 August, she died while descending from the summit of K2.\n\nAfter a brief return to the United Kingdom to visit her family, she left in June 1995 to join an American team which had gained a permit to climb K2, the world's second-highest mountain, located in Pakistan. K2 is regarded as a significantly more difficult and dangerous climb than Mount Everest. By 13 August 1995, the remnants of the US team and Hargreaves had joined forces with a New Zealand and Canadian team at Camp 4, around above sea level, and at least 12 hours from the summit. Later that day, having joined with a Spanish team of mountaineers above Camp 4, New Zealander Peter Hillary, son of Everest pioneer Sir Edmund Hillary, decided to turn back, noting that the weather that had been fine for the previous four days appeared to be changing. At 6:45 pm, in fine conditions, Hargreaves and Spaniard Javier Olivar reached the summit, followed by American Rob Slater, Spaniards Javier Escartín and Lorenzo Ortíz, and New Zealander Bruce Grant. All six died in a violent storm while returning from the summit. Canadian Jeff Lakes, who had turned back below the summit earlier, managed to reach one of the lower camps but died from the effects of exposure.\n\nThe next day, two Spanish climbers, Pepe Garces and Lorenzo Ortas, who had survived the storm at Camp 4, were descending the mountain suffering from frostbite and exhaustion. Before reaching Camp 3 they found a bloodstained anorak, a climbing boot, and a harness. They recognized the equipment as belonging to Hargreaves. From Camp 3 they could also see a body in the distance. They did not approach the body, so it was not positively identified, but they had little doubt it was Hargreaves and concluded she had been blown off the mountain during the storm. After the incident, Captain Fawad Khan, the Pakistani army officer who was the team's intermediary with the rescue services, claimed that he had urged her not to climb beyond base camp because it would be \"suicidal\" in the deteriorating weather conditions.\n\nHargreaves grew up in Belper, Derbyshire and attended Belper High School. After leaving home at 18, she lived with and later married James Ballard, and in 1995 the family moved to Spean Bridge, in the Scottish Highlands, closer to conditions suitable for her training.\n\nShe was six months pregnant with her first child, Tom, when she climbed the Eiger north face. Tom Ballard went on to become the first person to solo climb all of the six great north faces of the Alps in a single winter. He died in 2019 while ascending Nanga Parbat.\n\n\n\nStephen Venables (1995) Obituary 21 August 1995 \"Independent Digital News & Media\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2003317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003317", "title": "Logical security", "text": "Logical security\n\nLogical Security consists of software safeguards for an organisation’s systems, including user identification and password access, authenticating, access rights and authority levels. These measures are to ensure that only authorized users are able to perform actions or access information in a network or a workstation. It is a subset of computer security.\n\nElements of logical security are:\n\n\nToken Authentication are small devices that authorized users of computer systems or networks carry to assist in identifying that who is logging into a computer or network system is actually authorized. They can also store cryptographic keys and biometric data. The most popular type of security token (RSA SecurID) displays a number which changes every minute. Users are authenticated by entering a personal identification number and the number on the token. The token contains a time of day clock and a unique seed value, and the number displayed is a cryptographic hash of the seed value and the time of day. The computer which is being accessed also contains the same algorithm and is able to match the number by matching the user’s seed and time of day. Clock error is taken into account, and values a few minutes off are sometimes accepted. Another similar type of token (Cryptogram) can produce a value each time a button is pressed. Other security tokens can connect directly to the computer through USB, Smart card or Bluetooth ports, or through special purpose interfaces. Cell phones and PDA's can also be used as security tokens with proper programming.\n\nPassword Authentication uses secret data to control access to a particular resource. Usually, the user attempting to access the network, computer or computer program is queried on whether they know the password or not, and is granted or denied access accordingly. Passwords are either created by the user or assigned, similar to usernames. However, once assigned a password, the user usually is given the option to change the password to something of his/her choice. Depending on the restrictions of the system or network, the user may change his/her password to any alphanumeric sequence. Usually, limitations to password creation include length restrictions, a requirement of a number, uppercase letter or special character, or not being able to use the past four or five changed passwords associated with the username. In addition, the system may force a user to change his/her password after a given amount of time.\n\nTwo-Way Authentication involves both the user and system or network convincing each other that they know the shared password without transmitting this password over any communication channel. This is done by using the password as the encryption key to transmit a randomly generated piece of information, or “the challenge.” The other side must then return a similarly encrypted value which is some predetermined function of the originally offered information, his/her “response,” which proves that he/she was able to decrypt the challenge. Kerberos (a computer network authentication protocol) is a good example of this, as it sends an encrypted integer N, and the response must be the encrypted integer N + 1.\n\nAccess Rights and Authority Levels are the rights or power granted to users to create, change, delete or view data and files within a system or network. These rights vary from user to user, and can range from anonymous login (Guest) privileges to Superuser (root) privileges. Guest and Superuser accounts are the two extremes, as individual access rights can be denied or granted to each user. Usually, only the system administrator (a.k.a. the Superuser) has the ability to grant or deny these rights.\n\nGuest accounts, or anonymous logins, are set up so that multiple users can log into the account at the same time without a password. Users are sometimes asked to type a username. This account has very limited access, and is often only allowed to access special public files. Usually, anonymous accounts have read access rights only for security purposes.\n\nThe superuser is an authority level assigned to system administrators on most computer operating systems. In Unix and related operating systems, this level is also called root and has all access rights in the system, including changing ownership of files. In pre-Windows XP and NT systems (such as DOS and Windows 9x), all users are effectively superusers, and all users have all access rights. In Windows NT and related systems (such as Windows 2000 and XP), a superuser is known as the Administrator account. However, this Administrator account may or may not exist depending on whether separation up.\n\n\n\nSpecific\n"}

An international activist for human rights and women's suffrage, she made her first speech against slavery when she was 16 years old. As a young woman, Remond delivered speeches throughout the Northeast United States against slavery. One of her brothers, Charles Lenox Remond, became known as an orator and sometimes they toured together for anti-slavery lectures.\n\nIn 1858 Remond was chosen to travel to England to gather support for the abolitionist cause in the United States. While in London, Remond also studied at the Bedford College for Women, lecturing during term breaks. During the American Civil War, she appealed for support in Great Britain for the Union Army and the Union blockade of the Confederacy. After the war, she appealed for funds to support the millions of the newly emancipated freedmen in the American South.\n\nFrom England, Remond went to Italy in 1867 to pursue medical training in Florence, where she became a physician. She practiced medicine for nearly 20 years in Italy and never returned to the United States.\n\nBorn in Salem, Massachusetts, Remond was one of eight, ten, or eleven children of John Remond and Nancy (née Lenox) Remond. Nancy was born in Newton, daughter of Cornelius Lenox, a Revolutionary War veteran who had fought in the Continental Army, and Susanna Perry. John Remond was a free person of color who immigrated to Massachusetts from the Dutch island of Curaçao as a child of 10 in 1798. John and Nancy married in October 1807, in the African Baptist Church in Boston. In Salem, they built a successful catering, provisioning, and hairdressing business, becoming well-established businesspeople and activists.\n\nThe Remonds tried to place their children in a private school, but they were rejected because of their skin color. When Sarah Remond and her sisters were accepted to a local high school for girls, which was not segregated, they were expelled, as the school committee was planning to found a separate school for children of color. Remond later described the incident as engraved in her heart \"like the scarlet letter of Hester.\"\n\nIn 1835, the Remond family moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where they hoped to find a less racist environment in which to educate their children. However, the schools refused to accept black students. Instead, some influential African Americans established a private school, where Remond was educated.\n\nIn 1841, the Remond family returned to Salem. Sarah Remond continued her education on her own, attending concerts and lectures, and reading widely in books, pamphlets and newspapers borrowed from friends, or purchased from the anti-slavery society of her community, which sold many inexpensive titles. The Remond family also took in as boarders students who were attending the local girls' academy, including Charlotte Forten (later Grimké).\n\nThree of Remond's sisters built a business together: Cecilia (married to James Babcock), Maritchie Juan, and Caroline (married to Joseph Putnam), \"owned the fashionable Ladies Hair Work Salon\" in Salem, as well as the biggest wig factory in the state. Their oldest sister Nancy married James Shearman, an oyster dealer. The Remond brothers were Charles Remond, who became an abolitionist and orator; and John Remond, who married Ruth Rice, one of two women elected to the finance committee of the 1859 New England Colored Citizens' Convention.\n\nSalem in the 1840s was a center of anti-slavery activity, and the whole family was committed to the abolition movement. The Remonds' home was a haven for black and white abolitionists, and they hosted many of the movement's leaders, including William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips, and more than one fugitive slave fleeing north to freedom. John Remond was a life member of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. Sarah Remond's older brother Charles Lenox Remond was the first black lecturer of the American Anti-Slavery Society's and considered a leading black abolitionist. Nancy Remond was one of the founders of the Salem Female Anti-Slavery Society. Nancy not only taught her daughters the household skills of cooking and sewing but also to seek liberty lawfully; she wanted them to take part in society. With her mother and sisters, Sarah Remond was an active member of the state and county female anti-slavery societies, including the Salem Female Anti-Slavery Society, the New England Anti-Slavery Society, and the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. She also regularly attended antislavery lectures in Salem and Boston.\n\nWith the support and financial backing of her family, Sarah Remond became an anti-slavery lecturer, delivering her first lecture against slavery at the age of 16, with her brother Charles in Groton, Massachusetts, in July 1842.\n\nRemond rose to prominence among abolitionists in 1853, when she refused to sit in a segregated theater section. She had bought tickets by post for herself and a group of friends, including historian William C. Nell, to the popular opera, \"Don Pasquale,\" at the Howard Athenaeum in Boston. When they arrived at the theatre, Remond was shown to segregated seating. After refusing to accept it, she was forced to leave the theatre and pushed down some stairs. Remond sued for damages and won her case. She was awarded $500, and an admission by theatre management that she was wronged; the court ordered the theater to integrate all seating.\n\nIn 1856, the American Anti-Slavery Society hired a team of lecturers, including Remond; her brother Charles, already well known in the US and Britain; and Susan B. Anthony, to tour New York State addressing anti-slavery issues. Over the next two years, she, her brother, and others also spoke in New York, Massachusetts, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. She and other African Americans were often given poor accommodation due to racial discrimination.\n\nAlthough inexperienced, Remond rapidly became an effective speaker. William Lloyd Garrison praised her \"calm, dignified manner, her winning personal appearance and her earnest appeals to the conscience and the heart.\" Sarah Clay wrote that Remond's every word \"waked up dormant aspirations which would vibrate through the ages.\" Over time, she became one of the society's most persuasive and powerful lecturers.\n\nAbby Kelley Foster, a noted abolitionist in Massachusetts, encouraged Remond when they toured together in 1857. On December 28, 1858, Remond wrote in a letter to Foster:\n\nAs a good speaker and fundraiser, Remond was invited to take the anti-slavery message to Great Britain, as her brother Charles had done ten years earlier. Accompanied by the Reverend Samuel May, Jr., she sailed from Boston for Liverpool on December 28, 1858, on the steamer \"Arahia\". They arrived in Liverpool on January 12, 1859, after a frightening trip in the winter. The ship had become covered with ice and snow. It rolled and tossed so much that many of the passengers were sick, including Remond.\n\nAt Tuckerman Institute on January 21, 1859, Remond gave her first antislavery lecture in England. Her second lecture, \"Slave Life in America,\" took place just a few days later on January 24. During these speeches, she spoke eloquently of the inhumane treatment of slaves in the United States, her stories shocking many of her listeners. She also described the discrimination endured by free blacks throughout the United States.\n\nRemond lectured to crowds in cities throughout the British Isles for the next three years, raising large sums of money for the anti-slavery cause. Between 1859 and 1861, she gave more than forty-five lectures in England, Ireland, and Scotland. Remond also appeared at times with Frederick Douglass.\n\nAlthough before she sailed, Remond expected to confront similar prejudice as what she encountered in the United States, writing Abby Kelly Foster that she feared not \"the wind nor the waves, but I know that no matter how I go, the spirit of prejudice will meet me,\" she met with some acceptance in Britain. \"I have been received here as a sister by white women for the first time in my life,\" she wrote; \"I have received a sympathy I never was offered before.\"\n\nRemond was praised for her speeches, in which she spoke out against slavery and racial discrimination, stressing the sexual exploitation of black women under slavery. Remond called on common themes found in sentimental fiction, such as family, womanhood, and marriage, to evoke an emotional response in her audience.\n\nDuring her tour of Ireland, she compared the plight of the African slave to the working-class laborers in her audience, worrying her middle-class and elite British sponsors. In her short autobiography, written in 1861, she observed that \"prejudice against colour has always been the one thing, above all others, which has cast its gigantic shadow over my whole life.\"\n\nOnce the American Civil War (1861–65) began, Remond worked to build support in Britain for the Union blockade of the Confederacy (which affected British shipping and manufacturing because of the cotton trade) and the Union cause. Because British textile factories relied heavily on American slave-harvested cotton, Remond focused on this in her lectures. In an 1862 speech, she implored her London audience to \"Let no diplomacy of statesmen, no intimidation of slaveholders, no scarcity of cotton, no fear of slave insurrections, prevent the people of Great Britain from maintaining their position as the friend of the oppressed negro.\" After the Civil War, Remond changed her focus to lecture on behalf of the millions of freedmen, soliciting funds and clothing for them. She was an active member of the London Emancipation Society and the Freedman's Aid Association in London. Her lecture \"The Freeman or the Emancipated Negro of the Southern States of the United States,\" delivered in London, was published in \"The Freedman\" (London) in 1867.\n\nIn the mid-1860s, Remond published a letter in the \"Daily News\" protesting that racial prejudice in Great Britain had worsened thanks to the efforts of the planter class in the West Indies and the American South.\n\nFrom October 1859 to June 1861, Remond undertook studies at the Bedford College for Women (later part of the University of London and now merged with Royal Holloway College). She studied classical academic subjects: French, Latin, English literature, music, history and elocution, continuing to give her own lectures during college vacations. During this period, she also traveled to Rome and Florence in Italy.\n\nRemond continued to be involved in racial and gender liberation in London. She was a member first of the London Emancipation Committee, and then helped found and served on the executive committee of the Ladies' London Emancipation Society, which was organized in 1863. Remond is thought to be the only black woman who was among the 1500 signatories to a women-only, 1866 petition requesting the right of women to vote. Returning briefly to the US, Remond joined with the American Equal Rights Association working for equal suffrage for women and African Americans.\n\nRemond continued her studies at the London University College, graduating as a nurse. Then, at the age of 42 in 1867, she moved permanently to Florence. She entered the school as a medical student. At the time, the school was one of the most prestigious medical schools in Europe. After completing her studies and becoming a doctor, she remained in Florence. Remond practiced medicine for more than 20 years, never returning to the United States. Her sister Caroline and Maritcha joined her there from the United States. Frederick Douglass met the three women while visiting Italy in 1886.\n\nIn Italy, on April 25, 1877, Remond married Lazzaro Pintor (1833–1913), an Italian office worker originally from Sardinia. By the 1880s, Remond Pintor had moved to Rome.\n\nRemond died on December 13, 1894, in Rome. She is interred at the Protestant Cemetery in Rome.\n\nIn 1999 the Massachusetts State House honored six outstanding women of the state by installing a series of six tall marble panels with a bronze bust in each; the busts are of Remond, Dorothea Dix, Florence Luscomb, Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, and Lucy Stone. Two quotations from each of these women are etched on their own marble panel. The wall behind the panels has wallpaper made of six government documents repeated over and over, with each document being related to a cause of one or more of the women.\n\nIn 2020 University College London renamed its Centre for the Study of Racism & Racialisation the Sarah Parker Remond Centre\n\n\n"}

His father was involved in the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and fled for a time to France where he studied chemistry. Back in Dublin Kean (now Kane) founded the Kane Company and manufactured sulphuric acid.\n\nThe young Kane studied chemistry at his father's factory, and attended lectures at the Royal Dublin Society as a teenager. He published his first paper in 1828, \"Observations on the existence of chlorine in the native peroxide of manganese\", in the London Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature and Art. The following year, his description of the natural arsenide of manganese resulted in the compound being named Kaneite in his honour. He studied medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, graduating in 1834 whilst working in the Meath Hospital. He was appointed Professor of Chemistry at the Apothecaries' Hall, Dublin in 1831, which earned him the moniker of the \"boy professor\". In the following year he participated in the founding of the Dublin Journal of Medical Science.\n\nOn the strength of his book \"Elements of Practical Pharmacy\" he was elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 1832. He studied acids, showed that hydrogen was electropositive, and proposed the existence of the ethyl radical. In 1836 he travelled to Gießen in Germany to study organic chemistry with Justus von Liebig. In 1843 he was awarded the Royal Irish Academy's Cunningham Medal for his work on the nature and constitution of compounds of Ammonia.\n\nHe published a three-volume \"Elements of Chemistry\" in 1841–1844, and a detailed report on the \"Industrial Resources of Ireland\". This included the first assessment of the water power potential of the River Shannon, which was not realised until the 1920s at Ardnacrusha.\n\nHe became a political adviser on scientific and industrial matters. He served on several commissions to enquire into the Great Irish Famine, along with Professors Lindley and Taylor, all more or less ineffective. His political and administrative work meant that his contribution to chemistry ceased after about 1844.\n\nHis work on Irish industry led to his being appointed director of the Museum of Irish Industry in Dublin in 1845. The Museum was a successor to the Museum of Economic Geology, and was housed at 51 St Stephen's Green. \n\nAlso in 1845 he became the first President of Queen's College, Cork (now University College Cork). He did not spend a lot of time in Cork as he had work in Dublin, and his wife lived there. The science building on the campus of this college (now University College Cork) is named in honour of Kane. He was knighted in 1846. In 1873 Kane took up the post of National Commissioner for Education. He was elected president of the Royal Irish Academy in 1877, holding the role until 1882. In 1880 he was appointed the first chancellor of the newly created Royal University of Ireland. After a motion to admit women to the University, put forward by Prof. Samuel Haugton at Academic Council in Trinity College Dublin, 10 March 1880, Kane was appointed to a committee of 10 men to look into the matter. He was opposed to the admission of women, and nothing was reported from the committee in the Council minutes for the next 10 years (Parkes, 2004).\n\nKane married Katherine Sophia Baily on 23 August 1838, with whom he had seven surviving children. Kane's eldest son Robert Romney Kane was known as a barrister. The second son, Henry Coey Kane, became an admiral in the Royal Navy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2003331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003331", "title": "Taylor, British Columbia", "text": "Taylor, British Columbia\n\nThe District of Taylor is a district municipality in northeastern British Columbia, Canada, located on mile 36 of the Alaska Highway. Taylor, a member municipality of the Peace River Regional District, covers an area of about 17.09 km² with 1,373 residents. As it is just south of the much larger city of Fort St. John, there is a sizable amount of commuting and interaction between the two.\n\nThe town sits on a terrace 60 m above the north bank of the Peace River. The first settler on the flat was a trapper named Herbert Taylor in 1911. The town incorporated in 1958 with industrial business beginning to locate there. Since then, Taylor has remained a small town, even though it has developed a large industrial base. It has become home to the annual World's Invitational Class 'A' Gold Panning Championships and was featured on the CBC Television program \"Village on a Diet\".\n\nThe town, and the Taylor Flats upon which the town is located, are named after Donald Herbert Taylor, a fur-trader with the Hudson's Bay Company who regularly met his Aboriginal trading counterparts on this river flat. In 1912 Taylor left his employers and took up residence on the flats with a few other squatters. That year the federal government opened the area to homesteading and Taylor was granted the land upon which he had settled. These early settlers were trappers with the first farm established by Henry Philip, from Glasgow, who inherited buildings, equipment and land from his survey team when they left the area. In 1915, there were 20 settlers. (Fort George Herald, 9 Oct 1915) In 1919, with the help of Taylor's nine children, along with those from a few American families who settled there, the provincial government opened the Taylor Flats School.\n\nThese early settlers all came to the area through the Peace River Country, through Grande Prairie and Pouce Coupe, and across the Peace River. Some decided to settle on the steep-sloped south side of the Peace River, an area that would become known as South Taylor. To cross the river a cable ferry, which would prove to be accident-prone, was built in the 1920s but was soon replaced with a motor-driven ferry. This ferry was used until 1942 when the U.S. Army came through the area building the Alaska Highway and constructed the long Peace River Suspension Bridge. The highway connected the town to a rail station in Dawson Creek reducing the dependence on shipping along the river. The bridge suddenly collapsed on October 16, 1957 with no injuries or fatalities. A new rail trestle, from the rail extension from Chetwynd to Fort St. John, was used while constructing the replacement Peace River Bridge. \n\nMajor industrial development began in 1957, when Westcoast Energy (later Duke Energy) built the province's first gas processing plant, as well as a refinery and pipeline to Kamloops. The community that formed around this industrial development was incorporated as a Village on August 23, 1958 and soon after Canfor opened a planer mill. Meanwhile, upstream, the W.A.C. Bennett Dam was completed in 1966 and the Peace Canyon Dam in 1980, which controlled the level and flow of the Peace River, making navigation and flood control much easier.\n\nFollowing the construction of a natural gas processing plant by Westcoast Energy in 1985, Fibreco Pulp opened its sawmill in 1988, and the Village was re-incorporated into the District of Taylor in 1989. Despite the closure of the Petro-Canada refinery in 1991, economic growth continued throughout the decade as Westcoast Energy's McMahon Gas Plant expanded in 1991 and added a cogeneration plant in 1993. Fibreco Pulp doubled its capacity in 1996, the Younger Natural Gas Liquids Extraction Plant (to extract water and sulphur from natural gas) was expanded in 1996, and the Taylor Straddle plant (to extract ethane from natural gas) was built in 1997. Since 1993, the town of 1,373 residents have built a new hockey arena, leisure skating arena, curling rink, and an 18-hole golf course. Strong community pride also developed as demonstrated by the town placing first at the provincial level, in its small category, in the parks and gardens-oriented Communities in Bloom Competition in 1997 and second in the national competition in 1998. Other local projects have included building a memorial garden and cenotaph in 2000 dedicated to the 341st Engineers of the U.S. Army corps of Engineers who were stationed on the Taylor Flats in 1942 during the construction of the Alaska Highway and the Peace River Suspension Bridge.\n\nThe 1961 Canadian census, the first to include Taylor as a distinct subdivision, counted 438 people. During the subsequent five years the population rose 36% to 595 people but rose only a further 2% to 605 people by 1971. The population spiked in the late-1970s during the construction of the Peace Canyon Dam and when the sawmills were opened in town. After the dams were built businesses left and the population decline in the early-1980s. Since 1985 a series of large industrial businesses opened facilities in town creating a steady population rise since then.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Canadian Census, there were 1,405 people living in the municipality in 535 households. A little over the provincial average 68.5% are married while 31.5% are single. With 2.5% of Taylor residents being foreign-born, and 96.4% with an English-only mother tongue, the town has few visible minorities.\nWhile not counted as visible minorities during the census, 180 people considered themselves to have an Aboriginal identity, just over twice the provincial average of 5.4%. Housing is mostly owned with 21.5% of the stock being rented, with the provincial average being 29.8%.\n\nThe Taylor Flats, upon which the town is situated, was formed by a pre-glacial bend in the Peace River that now flows eastwards, originating in Hudson's Hope and emptying into the Arctic Ocean. The terrace is approximately 60 m above the north bank of the Peace River. Escarpments encircle the terrace and rise another 100 m to the upland Peace River Prairie. The soil of the Taylor Flats has few limitations, and is rated as prime in some areas. The soils are Rego black loam and clay loam that contain few stones or gravel and are well drained, yet hold adequate moisture for crops. There are several hundred acres of Agricultural Land Reserve within the municipal boundaries on both the east and west sides of the town site. Most of the original vegetation and tree stands have been cleared but black spruce and aspen trees, and an understory of Labrador tea, bog cranberry\nand mosses are present.\n\nThe town has a northern, semiarid continental climate with cool, short summers and long, cold winters. However, the Taylor Flats’ microclimate, created by the south-facing terrace and the Peace River, produces more frost-free days than most of the Peace River Country. Being in a rain shadow of the Rocky Mountains the town receives a suppressed amount of precipitation, and especially snowfall. Like the rest of the region, the town has long daylight hours in the summer, short winter daylight hours and uses Mountain Standard Time year-round.\n\nTaylor's transportation network is dominated by the two-lane Alaska Highway (Highway 97) which runs north-south through the middle of community and provides the only highway entrance and exit to the town. Cherry Avenue East is a rural road transportation route that travels through Baldonnel to Fort St. John. Intersections along the highway give access to frontage roads lined with businesses and civic buildings oriented to the highway. The frontage roads also provide access to housing behind the businesses. A wide right-of-way provides a large building setback distance from the highway and helps mitigate noise and other negative impacts of heavy traffic. In total, Taylor maintains 23 km of paved and 14 km of unpaved roads.\n\nTaylor has limited rail, bus, boating and air service for regional and provincial transportation needs. A BC Rail line runs northeast from Chetwynd to Fort St. John and branches off eastwards to Taylor. The rail line’s terminus is in the industrial sector in the southeast corner on the town. The train, which does not offer passenger service, must turn around in the industrial area in order to travel back to the trunk line. Greyhound Bus Lines maintain a stop in Taylor along its Alaska Highway route from Dawson Creek, 56.5 km south of Taylor to Fort St. John (14 km north of Taylor). Since the Peace River is controlled by two dams upstream, it is navigable for recreational boats, however, due to the coulee between industry and the river, the shipping industries in the town did not develop. The closest commercial airport is Fort St. John Airport, 13.8 km north of Taylor, with two paved runways.\n\nThe town uses the Peace River which flows eastward as a source of drinking water and as outlet for industrial waste. The drinking water supply comes from an intake pipe southwest of town. The water is mechanically and chemically filtered then pumped to a reservoir on a ridge north of town. A gravity pump moves the water to the town from the reservoir using 18 km of watermains. Sewage is collected by 13 km of sanitary sewers and processed by a two-cell lagoon system before being absorbed into the ground.\n\nTaylor's only school, Taylor Elementary School, is administered by School District 60 Peace River North, which in 2005 had an enrollment of 147 students. Any students grades 7 and up are transported to Fort St. John for secondary school education. Taylor funds a volunteer fire department, which covers the town plus several kilometers into the rural areas. The closest hospital for Taylor residents is the Fort St. John General Hospital but residents can access medical resources through the Taylor Medical Clinic.\n\nFor a town of 1,373 people, Taylor has a very large industrial base and calls itself \"Where Peace and Prosperity Meet.\" Industrial plants include the Westcoast Energy's McMahon plant for natural gas processing with sulfur recovery and cogeneration, two straddle plants which extract ethane and other impurities from liquid natural gas, Canfor Pulp's chemi-thermomechanical pulp mill, and several smaller sawmills. Being involved in primary resource industries, the town is vulnerable to global trade, as demonstrated by the town's Canfor planer mill closing in 2004 during U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute. In response to the decline of the forest industry, the town has expanded its tourism industry. After the Canfor mill closure, the District established a plan to develop Peace Island Park for tourist operations. The federal Ministry of Western Economic Diversification, contributed $310,952 to the project.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Canadian census, only 2.7% of Taylor's population graduated from a university, much less than the 22.1% provincial average and, likewise, 34.3% did not graduate from secondary school, twice the provincial average. Of Taylor's 775 person labour force, 32.3%, or 250 people (220 males and 25 females), are employed as tradesmen, transport and equipment operators and in related occupations. With Fort St. John only 14 km north of Taylor it is within commuting distance for employees and shoppers. Taylor itself has little commercial retail stores, including no grocery store, but residents commute to Fort St. John for their retail needs.\n\nDespite its small population base and its proximity to a much larger urban centre Taylor has an ice arena, a curling rink, indoor swimming pool, irrigated baseball diamonds, a motocross track, and an 18-hole championship golf course. The District Ice Center opened in 1993 and consists of an ice hockey rink and leisure skating rink, both of which are used for roller hockey, trade shows and conventions in the summer. The four sheet curling rink is used as a swimming pool in the summer. The District's newest facility, built in 2001, is a CND $1.2 million multi-purpose community hall and gymnasium, which now features a rehabilitation studio. The , 18-hole Lone Wolf Golf Course opened in 1995 at a cost of CND $3.5 million and is managed by the District. Meandering around the course, by agricultural fields, and a community forest, is the 4.2 km ParticipACTION Trail. In the winter the golf course and its trails are used for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and other winter activities.\n\nSince 2004 the District has operated Peace Island Park with its boat launch, campsites, and facilities for recreational outdoor events. Annual events in the community include a conformation dog show in May, and the Invitational Class 'A' Gold Panning Championships in the summer, among others. The gold panning competition is a three-day event that has been held in Taylor annually since 1972 and includes advanced and amateur competitions, a parade and other community-wide events. Also, to preserve its heritage, several pioneer log houses, such as the Information Centre, where a replica of Alexander Mackenzie's birch bark canoe is displayed, and Peace Island Park meeting hall, have been restored and are used today. In 2010/11 the town was featured on the CBC documentary series \"Village on a Diet\".\n\nThe District of Taylor has a Mayor and Council form of municipal government. At-large elections are held every four years to elect four municipal councillors, a mayor who also represents Taylor at the Peace River Regional District Board of Directors, and one school board trustee (to the school district). The November 2014 municipal election was the first election in 28 years that the District of Taylor elected a new mayor. Mayor Rob Fraser was elected after Former Mayor Fred Jarvis retired after 35 years in the public service sector.\n\nTaylor is situated in the Peace River North provincial electoral district and is represented by Pat Pimm in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. Prior to 2009, the town was located within the Peace River South electoral district and was represented by Blair Lekstrom who was first elected as its Member of the Legislative Assembly in the 2001 provincial election taking 78% of votes cast at the Taylor polls and re-elected in 2005 with 73% support. For the 1996 election, and those previous, Taylor was part of the Peace River North provincial electoral district which elected Richard Neufeld of the BC Reform Party.\n\nFederally, Taylor is located in the Prince George—Peace River riding, which is represented in the House of Commons of Canada by Conservative Party Member of Parliament Bob Zimmer. Prior to Zimmer the town was represented by long-time MLA Jay Hill, first elected in 1993 and re-elected in 1997, 2000, 2004, and 2006 with 82%, 83%, 79% and 80% support from Taylor polls, respectively. Before Hill the town was represented, from 1972 to 1993, by Frank Oberle of the Progressive Conservative Party who served as Minister of State for Science and Technology from 1985 to 1989 and Minister of Forestry from 1990 to 1993.\n\nCalverley, Dorthea.

They can also be sold as cheap souvenirs in tourist areas, which are sometimes called \"tchotchke shops\".\n\nA wide variety of spellings exist for the English usage of the term, e.g., \"tshotshke\", \"tshatshke\", \"tchachke\", \"tchotchka\", \"tchatchka\", \"chachke\", \"tsotchke\", \"chotski\", or \"chochke\"; the standard Yiddish transliteration is \"tsatske\" or \"tshatshke\". In YIVO standard orthography, it is spelled טשאַטשקע. In Israeli Hebrew it is often spelled , , with a tsade instead of teth-shin, as in Yiddish. A Hebrew variant is צ׳אצ׳קע, using צ (tsade) with a single apostrophe (usually called a chupchik, or geresh in more formal parlance).\n\nDepending on context, the term has a connotation of worthlessness or disposability as well as tackiness.\n\nA common confusion is between the terms \"tchotchke\" and \"tsatske\" or rather \"tsatskele\", with the diminutive ending -le.

Being Yiddish, the meaning can change by the use of gestures and a change in tone, so that \"tsatskele\" can become the favorite child.\n\nLeo Rosten, author of \"The Joys of Yiddish\", combines the two main meanings and gives an alternative sense of \"tchotchke\" as meaning a desirable young girl, a \"pretty young thing\". Less flatteringly, the term could be construed as a more dismissive synonym for \"bimbo\", or \"slut\".\n\nThe word \"tchotchke\" derives from a Slavic word for \"trinket\" ( ; , plural ; ; ; ), adapted to Yiddish singular .\n\n\n"}

After Tjodalv left Dimmu Borgir in the middle of March 1999 he started to concentrate fully on Susperia together with old-time friend Cyrus. At Wacken Open Air Festival in 1999, Tjodalv met with singer Athera (Vanaheim), who joined the band subsequently, followed by bass player Memnock (Old Man's Child, Vanaheim) and guitarist Elvorn. They recorded a demo, \"Illusions of Evil\", in December 1999 at Pitfire Studio outside Oslo, which was mixed and mastered by L. Argedick. Synthesizer and piano parts were played by Mustis (Dimmu Borgir). He was briefly an official member of the band before he left to fully concentrate on Dimmu Borgir. Mustis returned to the band in 2010, after being fired from Dimmu Borgir.\n\nThe demo was sent out to different record companies and gained some positive feedback. They received a few offers from mainly major record labels, and signed in early 2000 with Nuclear Blast for four records. Susperia played their first live gig at John Dee in Oslo, following Ragnarok and Alsvartr; just a few months later they played at the Scream Magazine 10 year anniversary party.\n\nSusperia is not a Satanic band, though their lyrics tend to criticize and question the views and morals of Christianity.\n\nOn March 9, 2009, it was reported that vocalist Athera (real name Pål Mathisen) had suffered a heart attack. It was later confirmed that he had been rushed into hospital in Lørenskog, Norway, suffering from acute stomach pain and heavy bleeding. He was expected to remain hospitalised for some time. It was later announced that he would undergo a triple bypass operation on March 16, 2009.\n\nCyrus is currently the touring bassist for Dimmu Borgir. Susperia joined Melodi Grand Prix in 2011, but lost before the semi final. They are currently recording an EP with Mustis (Ex-Dimmu Borgir) joining them on keyboards. The EP will feature 2 new songs (most likely including the song \"Nothing Remains\") and 3 re-recordings with orchestral arrangements.\n\nAlso, in 2015, founding vocalist Athera left the band.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the capital of the Anosy Region and of the Tôlanaro District. It has been a port of local importance since the early 1500s, and a new port, the Ehoala Port, has been built by QMM and the World Bank. Formerly Fort-Dauphin, it was the first French settlement in Madagascar.\n\nTôlañaro was initially situated on a short, narrow peninsula on the extreme southeastern coast of Madagascar. It has since grown to cover a much greater area along the ocean, almost to Mount Bezavona.\n\nTôlanaro has a tropical rainforest climate, though it is less rainy than areas further north on the eastern Malagasy coast. Being closer to the centre of the subtropical anticyclones than other parts of Madagascar, most rainfall is orographic, and tropical cyclones are not as common as in more northerly parts of the island.\n\nThe bay of Tolanaro was found by a Portuguese Captain in 1500. Fort Dauphin was founded on an Antanosy village, Taolankarana, in 1643 by the French East India Company who built a fort there named in honor of the crown prince, the future Louis XIV of France. It was settled by around a hundred colonists, who found themselves involved in the local politics. The poor trade results (some ebony and little more was obtained) hardly justified the difficulties of the settlers, who suffered from tropical illnesses and other problems. After a conflict with the Antanosy people, the survivors were evacuated in 1674.\n\nOne Governor of this colony, Étienne de Flacourt, published the \"History of the Great Isle of Madagascar and Relations\", which was the main source of information on the island for Europeans until the late 19th century.\n\nAfter World War II and until Didier Ratsiraka took the presidency in 1975, Fort Dauphin had a thriving community of Malagasy, French, Chinese and Pakistani merchants with adequate roads connecting the city to Toliara to the west and Fianarantsoa to the west and then north. The port provided a means of exporting cattle to Mauritius and importing various goods from France and elsewhere. During the time Philibert Tsiranana was President of Madagascar, he enjoyed flying down to Fort Dauphin to stay in a villa above Libanona beach.\n\nIn 1975, the French businesses were nationalized, French citizens’ assets were frozen and several were briefly imprisoned.\n\nFort Dauphin was the headquarters of American Lutheran missionaries American Lutheran Church who worked in southern Madagascar (see Malagasy Lutheran Church) starting in 1888 for almost 100 years. They were engaged in community development, education, evangelism and medical work and also operated what was known as the \"American School\" and the \"Missionary Children's Home\" (MCH). The school is now a Maternelle and the MCH is the Mahavoky Hotel. In 1959 about 25 American Lutheran missionary families and quite a few single missionaries were living in over 20 towns in an area that ran roughly from Fort Dauphin northeast to Manantenina, west to Ranomafana, northwest to Tsivory, north to Betroka southwest to Betioky and southwest to St. Augustine. When the number of students seeking a US education in Madagascar on the island declined rapidly in the late 1970s, the school briefly moved to operate alongside an NMS school in Antsirabe in the mid-1980s until finally the very few remaining students began attending the American School in Antananarivo in the 1990s. American missionary families and other English-speaking families in Madagascar (including kids from other missionary organizations, NASA, and US Embassy employees living in Antananarivo) and for a time, even East Africa, sent their children to this boarding school. While most of the students were from the US, there were also Malagasy, Canadian and Norwegian students who went to this school, which from the 1960s to the end of the 1970s averaged 50 to 60 students per year in grades 1–12. Notable alumni include Dr. Carl Braaten, a noted Lutheran Theologian and co-founder of the Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology and the theological journal \"Pro Ecclesia\", Arndt Braaten, a pastor and professor at Luther College, David Brancaccio of the PBS NOW program, Dr. Peter Dyrud, Minneapolis Cardiologist, Dr. Pier Larson, Professor of African History, Johns Hopkins and Dr. Stan Quanbeck, medical missionary to Madagascar for 40 years.\n\nThe Lutheran missionaries also traded land above the original Fort Dauphin harbor for what was then a sand dune, which became Libanona where the cottages on top of the hill were built as a place for R&R and to live while they were visiting their children at the school. There is also a section of the town's cemetery where quite a few American Lutheran missionaries and several others are buried.\n\nSince the early 1970s, Fort Dauphin suffered an economic decline due to lack of good road connections to the rest of the country, rendering its port of local importance only. This in spite of significant foreign exchange earned from the export of live lobster (250 to over 350 tonnes per year from 1990 to 2005), sapphires and, up until the hotels in town were all filled by those working on QMM's mining project in 2007, tourism. Tourists have not yet returned in any significant numbers.\n\nThe Anosy area around Tolagnaro is currently undergoing a massive transformation associated with the development of a new ilmenite mine by the QIT Madagascar Minerals company (a subsidiary of the Rio Tinto Group) in the area. A new port at Ehoala, just west of Tolagnaro as well as new roads and a variety of mining facilities and housing for mine workers have been built at the cost of almost US$1 billion. These are the first major investments in the region's infrastructure for many decades. (For a history of this project as well as its social and environmental concepts, see). The mine is controversial however due to anticipated social upheaval, creation of a parallel economy and adverse environmental impacts, some of which have begun to manifest. Health officials also fear HIV/AIDS, which to date has been almost unknown in Madagascar, could spread to the island via foreigners working on the mine and its construction projects. Rio Tinto Alcan is also interested in mining an estimated 100 million tons of bauxite located near Manantenina which is approximately 100 km northeast of Tolagnaro.\n\nToday there are a variety of international non-governmental organizations with offices in Tolagnaro including Andrew Lees Trust, Anosy Community Development Trust, AVIA, Azafady, CARE, the Libanona Ecology Centre, and World Wide Fund for Nature. Additionally, the School for International Training (SIT) has a school house located at the Libanona Ecology Centre. Cara is the administrative center of the Anosy region.\n\nThe city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tôlagnaro.\n\n\nFor more information on the region's ecology, see \n\nA regional centre for distance education (CRTE) of the Centre National de Télé-Enseignement de Madagascar (CNETMAD) is located in Tolanaro.

{"id": "2003406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003406", "title": "Photovoltaic effect", "text": "Photovoltaic effect\n\nThe photovoltaic effect is the generation of voltage and electric current in a material upon exposure to light. It is a physical and chemical phenomenon.\n\nThe photovoltaic effect is closely related to the photoelectric effect. In either case, light is absorbed, causing excitation of an electron or other charge carrier to a higher-energy state. The main distinction is that the term \"photoelectric effect\" is now usually used when the electron is ejected out of the material (usually into a vacuum) and \"photovoltaic effect\" used when the excited charge carrier is still contained within the material. In either case, an electric potential (or voltage) is produced by the separation of charges, and the light has to have a sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier for excitation. The physical essence of the difference is usually that photoelectric emission separates the charges by ballistic conduction and photovoltaic emission separates them by diffusion, but some \"hot carrier\" photovoltaic device concepts blur this distinction.\n\nThe first demonstration of the photovoltaic effect, by Edmond Becquerel in 1839, used an electrochemical cell. The first solar cell, consisting of a layer of selenium covered with a thin film of gold, was experimented by Charles Fritts in 1884, but it had a very poor efficiency. However, the most familiar form of the photovoltaic effect uses solid-state devices, mainly in photodiodes. When sunlight or other sufficiently energetic light is incident upon the photodiode, the electrons present in the valence band absorb energy and, being excited, jump to the conduction band and become free. These excited electrons diffuse, and some reach the rectifying junction (usually a diode p-n junction) where they are accelerated into the p-type semiconductor material by the built-in potential (Galvani potential). This generates an electromotive force and an electrical current, and thus some of the light energy is converted into electric energy. The photovoltaic effect can also occur when two photons are absorbed simultaneously in a process called two-photon photovoltaic effect.\n\nThe photovoltaic effect was first observed by French physicist A. E. Becquerel in 1839. He explained his discovery in \"Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences\", \"the production of an electric current when two plates of platinum or gold immersed in an acid, neutral, or alkaline solution are exposed in an uneven way to solar radiation.\"\n\nBesides the direct excitation of free electrons, a photovoltaic effect can also arise simply due to the heating caused by absorption of the light. The heating leads to increased temperature of the semiconductor material, which is accompanied by temperature gradients. These thermal gradients in turn may generate a voltage through the Seebeck effect. Whether direct excitation or thermal effects dominate the photovoltaic effect will depend on many material parameters.\n\nAll above effects generate direct current, the first demonstration of the alternating current photovoltaic effect (AC PV) was done by Dr. Haiyang Zou and Prof. Zhong Lin Wang at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2017. The AC PV effect is the generation of alternating current (AC) in the nonequilibrium states when the light periodically shines at the junction or interface of material. The AC PV effect is based on the capacitive model that the current strongly depends on the frequency of the chopper. The AC PV effect is suggested to be a result of the relative shift and realignment between the quasi-Fermi levels of the semiconductors adjacent to the junction/interface under the nonequilibrium conditions. The electron flow in the external circuit back and forth to balance the potential difference between two electrodes. The organic solar cell, which the materials have no initial carrier concentration, does not have the AC PV effect. \n\nIn most photovoltaic applications the radiation is sunlight, and the devices are called solar cells. In the case of a semiconductor p-n (diode) junction solar cell, illuminating the material creates an electric current because excited electrons and the remaining holes are swept in different directions by the built-in electric field of the depletion region.the AC PV is operated at the non-equilibrium conditions. The first study was based on a p-Si/TiO2 nanofilm. It is found that except for the DC output generated by the conventional PV effect based on a p-n junction, AC current is also produced when a flashing light is illuminated at the interface. The AC PV effect does not follow the Ohm's law, instead, it is based on the capacitive model that the current strongly depends on the frequency of the chopper, but voltage is independent of the frequency. The peak current of AC at high switching frequency can be much higher than that from DC. The magnitude of the output is also associated with the light absorption of materials. \n\n"}

The picture was directed by Andrew V. McLaglen. The American folk song \"Oh Shenandoah\" features prominently in the film's soundtrack.\n\nThough set during the Civil War, the film's strong antiwar and humanitarian themes resonated with audiences in later years as attitudes began to change toward the Vietnam War. Upon its release, the film was praised for its themes as well as its technical production.\n\nIn the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1864, during the Civil War, family patriarch Charlie Anderson (James Stewart) and his six sons Jacob, John, James, Nathan, Henry, and Boy (who is 16) run the family farm, while his daughter Jennie (Rosemary Forsyth) and daughter-in-law Ann (Katharine Ross) take care of the housework. The family has no slaves. Though Charlie attends church weekly and considers himself a \"God fearing\" man, he doesn't give God credit for anything, but takes credit for himself especially during dinner prayer. He internally blames God for taking his wife from him. His family is constantly late for church and will force people out of their seats to make room for his family, much to the annoyance of the preacher and congregation.\n\nCharlie's oldest son Jacob (Glenn Corbett) wants to join the war, but Charlie repeatedly tells his family that they won't join the war until it concerns them. Although a few of the boys want to join, they respect their father's wishes and remain on the farm. Charlie's daughter Jennie is courted by a young Confederate officer named Sam (Doug McClure). He wants to marry Jennie, and when Charlie gives his permission, the wedding occurs a few days later. As soon as the vows are said, a corporal rides up and announces that Sam is wanted back immediately. Sam leaves, much to the sorrow of his new bride. Shortly after Sam leaves, Ann then goes into labor, giving birth to a baby girl whom they name Martha in honor of Charlie's late wife.\n\nWhile out hunting raccoon, Charlie's youngest son Boy (Phillip Alford) and his friend Gabriel (Eugene Jackson Jr.) stumble onto a Confederate ambush. They run away and stop for a drink at a pond. Boy is wearing an old rebel soldier kepi cap that he found at the river. When a Union patrol comes on them, they take Boy as a prisoner of war, mistakenly thinking he is a rebel soldier. Gabriel runs to tell the Andersons what happened. When Charlie hears the news, he and his sons and daughter Jennie leave to look for Boy, leaving James (Patrick Wayne) and his wife Ann at the farm with their young baby.\n\nThe first place the Andersons look is a Union camp. They are told there are no prisoners there, but Colonel Fairchild (George Kennedy), who also has a sixteen-year-old son, directs them to a possible location, where Confederate prisoners are shipped North via railroad. However, the captain in charge refuses to allow Charlie to look through the cars, as he \"has schedules to keep\". So Charlie sets up a roadblock, then disarms the Union guards and sends them away. He looks through the boxcars, but Boy is not there, so he mounts his horse to leave. As he looks up, he sees Sam coming through the crowd. Jennie is overjoyed to see her husband. Sam leaves with the Andersons, telling the soldiers to burn the train and go home.\n\nAfter being taken to a different prisoner of war camp, Boy is befriended by rebel soldier Carter (James Best), who plans to escape and decides to let Boy come along. They and a few other men successfully make it out of the camp and start heading south. Coming onto a Confederate camp, their unit is attacked by the Federals. Carter is killed, and Boy is shot in the leg. A Union soldier almost kills him, but it turns out to be his friend, Gabriel who has joined the Union Army. Gabriel helps him hide in a bush until after the battle.\n\nBack at the farm, scavengers raid the place, killing James and it's suggested that Ann was raped before she was killed too. On their way home, the Andersons run across a Confederate unit guarding the road. A young sentry, startled by the sound of horses, takes a shot at Jacob, killing him instantly. Charlie starts to strangle the sentry, but stops to ask him his age. The sentry replies, \"Sixteen, sir.\" Charlie, remembering that his youngest son is sixteen, emotionally tells the sentry that he wants him to live and be an old man and have many sons. He wants him to know what it feels like to lose one of them.\n\nWhen the Andersons return home, the doctor tells them what happened to James and Ann. Their child Martha is still alive, with the black woman acting as her nanny, and Charlie takes her in his arms. Next day at the breakfast table, Charlie begins his standard prayer, but is so heartbroken that he can't finish it. He goes out to the family graveyard to see his wife's grave. He sees the graves of James, Jacob and Ann alongside hers, and he hears church bells ringing in the distance.\n\nAt the farmhouse, he demands to know why no one told him it was Sunday. The whole family gets dressed and ready for church, arriving as the singing begins. As the congregation completes the first song, the pastor (Denver Pyle) starts to announce the next hymn. Boy stumbles through the back door on a crutch. The whole congregation looks, and Charlie Anderson turns to see what is happening. His face lights up, and he helps his son to the pew. Everyone joyously sings in unison as the story ends.\n\n\n\nHoward Thompson of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"a pretty good Civil War drama\" with Stewart \"perfectly cast,\" though he thought it was \"too long. Under the overly detailed direction of Andrew V. McLaglen, it hits and hangs onto many a static snag.\" \"Variety\" stated that \"the Technicolor film, despite a neuter title, packs drama, excitement and an emotional quality certain National Parks particularly reflected in the climax — which should find better-than-average reception in the general market ... Stewart, seldom without a cigar butt in the corner of his mouth, endows his grizzled role with a warm conviction.\" Philip K. Scheuer of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"a curious film for this day and age, a kind of anachronistic throwback to the bucolic ... Nevertheless, it serves as a reminder of homely virtues and homilies, as spoken, mostly, by James Stewart. He creates a unique character and sustains it convincingly through stress and tragic change.\" Leo Sullivan of \"The Washington Post\" praised it as \"an engrossing film with lots of heart and even a soul,\" adding, \"Playing with splendid conviction, Stewart forgoes his usual tricks to gain sympathy for this widower who has raised six sons and an equally sturdy daughter. His performance is a thoughtful study in one man's attempt at neutrality.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote, \"Basically sentimental, the film even includes a scene where the longstanding but still sorrowing widower philosophizes about life over his wife's grave, but the treatment often has a freshness and humour which show that McLaglen has learned from his admiration for John Ford ... James Stewart, whose laconic drawl makes the dialogue sound funnier than it really is, gives one of the best performances of his career.\" The film was particularly successful at the box office within the state of Virginia, the movie's locale.\n\nIn 1966, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound (Waldon O. Watson). For her part in \"Shenandoah\", Rosemary Forsyth was nominated for a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer - Female.\n\nThe film was adapted as a hit Broadway musical in 1975, which won John Cullum his first Tony Award for Best Actor.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2003413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003413", "title": "Office for Fair Access", "text": "Office for Fair Access\n\nThe Office for Fair Access (OFFA) was an independent public body in England that supported the Director of Fair Access to Higher Education in his or her work that was intended to safeguard and promote fair access to higher education. It approved and monitored higher education institutions in England through 'access agreements'.\n\nAll English universities and colleges that wanted to charge higher fees must have had 'access agreements' approved by the Director of Fair Access to Higher Education.\n\nThe first Director, appointed in 2004, was Sir Martin Harris. He was followed by Les Ebdon, whose appointment was confirmed in February 2012.\n\nAs a consequence of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017, OFFA and the Higher Education Funding Council for England were replaced by the new Office for Students. OFFA's responsibilities officially ceased on the 31 March 2018.\n\nThe Higher Education Act 2004 introduced the concept of variable tuition fees for the first time. Whilst some parts of the United Kingdom, most notably Scotland, did not implement top-up fees, most universities and higher education institutions (HEIs) in the United Kingdom in England and sought to implement the new funding regime.\n\nThat regime allowed HEIs to charge tuition fees of any amount from £0 to £3,000. (These caps were raised in 2010.) At the time this policy was being debated there was considerable concern that the amount of debt new graduates would be faced with could dissuade some potential students from entering higher education altogether. Thus, as part of the debate, the government decided to institute a regulator to ensure that HEIs took steps to ensure that such dissuasion did not occur. The Act established the post of Director of Fair Access to Higher Education and the supporting body OFFA, and gave the Director the power to prevent a HEI charging fees above £1,200 if it could not satisfy the regulator that it would make adequate provision for widening access and encouraging participation.\n\nFor the academic year starting September 2012, the amount that institutions could charge increased to £9,000, subject to approval by the Director of Fair Access to Higher Education.\n\nIt was headquartered in Stoke Gifford in South Gloucestershire in the offices of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE).\n\nOFFA stated that it had two core aims:\n\n\nThese aims were primarily delivered through implementation of approved access agreements, and OFFA's work in monitoring access agreements and disseminating their view of good practice.\n\nAn access agreement was a document setting out how a university or college charging higher fees intends to safeguard and promote fair access to higher education through its outreach work, financial support etc. It also includes targets and milestones, set by the university/college itself. Many access agreements remained in force following OFFA's closure and continued to be regulated by the Office for Students.\n\nOFFA defined a bursary as a cash award where the student's eligibility is either wholly or partially dependent on their assessed household income. This is separate from a scholarship which it defined as an award where eligibility is not dependent on the recipient's assessed household income. For example, some universities and colleges offer scholarships based on academic criteria or whether the student lives in the local area.\n\nBefore 2012–13, universities and colleges who charged higher tuition fees had to give a minimum bursary to students entitled to receive the full state Maintenance Grant or Special Support Grant. In 2011–12, the minimum bursary was £338 although in practice, most universities and colleges gave much more than the minimum bursary – the typical bursary given to students on the full Maintenance Grant in 2011–12 was around £900 a year. Students who started their course in 2011–12 or before must continue to receive a minimum bursary.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2013, following Government changes to student finance, there is no minimum bursary. In parallel with these changes, which were introduced at a time when the partners in the UK's Conservative/Liberal Democrat Coalition Government had opposite manifesto commitments over the raising of the fee cap to £9,000, a National Scholarship Programme (NSP) was introduced to give non-repayable financial support to lower income students. Independent evaluations of the NSP found that it was of limited effect in widening participation and it was withdrawn after three years.\n\nCharges often made against OFFA were that it levelled down standards rather than raising them and that it replaced one form of unfairness with another as reforms were being achieved by \"disadvantaging\" the brightest children. At the time of its foundation, one member of the then shadow cabinet called OFFA “an interfering, manipulative, corrosive emblem of political correctness. At the time of its closure, the outgoing director rebuked this criticism and noted that for the period of OFFA's existence, there had been an 82% increase in the higher education participation of disadvantaged areas.\n\n\n"}

The treaties ended various interconnected wars among France, the Dutch Republic, Spain, Brandenburg, Sweden, Denmark, the Prince-Bishopric of Münster, and the Holy Roman Empire. The most significant of the treaties was the first, which established peace between France and the Dutch Republic and placed the northern border of France very near its modern position.\n\nThe Franco-Dutch War of 1672–78 was the source of all the other wars that were ended formally at Nijmegen. Separate peace treaties were arranged for conflicts like the Third Anglo-Dutch War and the Scanian War, but all of them had been directly caused by and form part of the Franco-Dutch War. England initially participated in the war on the French side but withdrew in 1674, after the Treaty of Westminster.\n\nPeace negotiations had begun as early as 1676, but nothing was agreed to and signed before 1678. The treaties did not result in a lasting peace. Some of the countries involved signed peace deals elsewhere, such as the Treaty of Celle (Sweden made peace with Brunswick and Lunenburg-Celle), Treaty of Saint-Germain (France and Sweden made peace with Brandenburg) and Treaty of Fontainebleau (France dictated peace between Sweden and Denmark-Norway).\n\n\n\nThe Franco–Dutch War ended with a treaty which gave France control over the region of the Franche-Comté. France also gained further territories of the Spanish Netherlands, adding to those it had annexed under the 1659 Peace of the Pyrenees and 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. These included the town of Saint-Omer with the remaining northwestern part of the former Imperial County of Artois; the lands of Cassel, Aire and Ypres in southwestern Flanders; the Bishopric of Cambrai; and the towns of Valenciennes and Maubeuge in the southern County of Hainaut.\n\nIn turn, French King Louis XIV ceded the occupied town of Maastricht and the Principality of Orange to the Dutch stadtholder William III. The French forces withdrew from several occupied territories in northern Flanders and Hainaut.\n\nEmperor Leopold I had to accept the French occupation of the towns of Freiburg (until 1697) and Kehl (until 1698) on the right bank of the Rhine.\n\nMarc-Antoine Charpentier wrote a Te Deum for this occasion. The prelude of the Te Deum is also known as the Eurovision Song Contest theme.\n\n"}

Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., 545 U.S. 119 (2005), was a United States Supreme Court decision that determined (in a 6-3 decision) that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to foreign cruise ships in American waters.\n\nDouglas Spector and the four other disabled plaintiffs use mobility scooters and wheelchairs. They sued Norwegian Cruise Line under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act after traveling aboard cruise ships (the Norwegian Sea and the Norwegian Star) registered in the Bahamas. Spector had purchased premium tickets, which were marketed as more handicap friendly. However, the ship was not easily accessible. He had limited or no access to swimming pools, restaurants, elevators, and public restrooms because of physical barriers. The premium room was of lower quality than less expensive non-wheelchair friendly rooms. He was not allowed to participate in emergency drills and no emergency exit plan was laid out for disabled persons. Norwegian Cruise Line argued that American laws did not apply to the cruise line because it was registered in the Bahamas. The cruise line's ships, however, were based out of Miami ports.\n\nSpector first sued the cruise line in federal district court in Houston, Texas (Spector's home town). The court ruled against Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd. saying that despite their foreign flag they must abide by American laws when in American waters.

{"id": "2003440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003440", "title": "U.S. Route 220", "text": "U.S. Route 220\n\nU.S. Route 220 (US 220) is a spur route of US 20. It runs in a north–south layout in the eastern United States, unlike its parent which runs east-west. US 220 extends for from an intersection with US 1 in Rockingham, North Carolina, to its interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate 86 and New York State Route 17) in South Waverly, Pennsylvania. Some sections of the route are part of the Appalachian Development Highway System's Corridor O as well as I-73 in North Carolina. US 220 is a spur route of US 20; however, the two routes neither intersect nor connect via other spurs of US 20.\n\nUS 220 was assigned in 1926 as part of the establishment of the U.S. Highway System. At the time, it extended from Cumberland, Maryland, to the New York–Pennsylvania border at Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania. One year later, US 220 was realigned north of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to connect to the New York state line at South Waverly; this supplanted most of what was originally designated U.S. Route 711. US 220 was extended south through Virginia by 1935 and to its current southern terminus by 1941.\n\nUS 220 begins at an at-grade interchange with US 1 (South Hancock Street) southwest of Rockingham and northeast of US 1's grade-separated interchange with US 74 (future I-74). Most of US 220 in North Carolina is a four-lane divided highway, and it is a freeway between I-85 and US 1 and US 421 in southern Greensboro. From Rockingham, US 220 travels north through Richmond County to Ellerbe, where US 220 begins to follow a newly constructed four-lane bypass. This section of the route is co-designated as I-74 and I-73. The old US 220 alignment, signed as US 220 Alternate, passes through the towns of Ellerbe and Norman while the new highway goes around the communities.\nThe two highways continue in close proximity through Montgomery and Randolph counties, serving the towns of Candor, Biscoe, Star, and Seagrove. US 220 Alternate rejoins its parent near the North Carolina Zoo, at which point the old path of US 220 continues into Asheboro and Randleman as US 220 Business. The US 220 freeway, meanwhile, skirts the west side of both cities and proceeds to Level Cross, a small community south of the Guilford County line. The business route merges back into the mainline here, and US 220 travels alone into Guilford County.\n\nOutside Greensboro, US 220 intersects I-85 and US 421 (the Greensboro Urban Loop) before intersecting I-85 Business and eventually merging with I-40 in the city. US 220 exits I-40 later, following US 29 and US 70 onto O'Henry Boulevard. The three routes separate northeast of the city center, with US 220 continuing west on Wendover Avenue along the northern edge of downtown Greensboro. It eventually exits onto Battleground Avenue, which takes the route north out of Greensboro and into Summerfield and Rockingham County. Another business route splits off US 220 near Madison to serve both Madison and Mayodan, which US 220 itself bypasses to the east. It returns to US 220 north of Stoneville, the last major community along the route before it crosses into Virginia.\n\nUS 220 enters the state from the south just south of Martinsville. It uses freeway spurs to bypass Martinsville and Rocky Mount. US 220 in Virginia is a divided four-lane highway with a speed limit for most of the distance between Martinsville and Roanoke. US 220 is a winding road in several stretches, and there have been many accidents. There is also a sharp speed decrease in Boones Mill, giving the town a reputation as a speed trap. The proposed I-73 would generally parallel US 220 between Greensboro, North Carolina, and Roanoke, though funds have not been allocated for the project and some local residents prefer efforts to fix US 220. It is co-signed with I-581 from downtown Roanoke to I-81 north of the city.\n\nThe route continues along I-81 northbound until Daleville, at an interchange with US 220 Alternate. US 220 leaves the freeway and once again becomes a four-lane road through Fincastle and Eagle Rock until just outside Clifton Forge, and joins up with I-64 westbound until Covington. From there, it continues on a primarily two-lane mountainous path until it reaches the West Virginia state line.\n\nThe highway enters West Virginia 2 miles (3 km) south of Harper in Pendleton County. From the state line, US 220 parallels the South Branch Potomac River as it progresses northward. 13 miles (21 km) north of Harper, US 220 passes through Franklin, where it intersects with US 33. The route crosses into Grant County approximately north of Franklin.\n\nWithin Grant County, US 220 intersects the concurrent routes of West Virginia Route 28 (WV 28) and West Virginia Route 55 in Petersburg. The two state highways join US 220 eastward into Hardy County. WV 28 and WV 55 remain concurrent to Moorefield, where WV 55 splits from US 220 and WV 28. North of Moorefield, US 220 and WV 28 intersects the future right-of-way of US 48. US 220 and WV 28 remain concurrent into Hampshire County, where US 220 and WV 28 meet US 50 in Junction. WV 28 departs US 220, following US 50 to the east, while US 220 joins US 50 westward into Mineral County. This stretch of US 220 is known as the Northwestern Turnpike.\nAt the top of Knobly Mountain northwest of Ridgeville, US 220 splits from US 50 and resumes a northerly alignment as it descends into the New Creek Valley. It is known as Cut Off Road south of WV 972 and New Creek Drive from there to Keyser, the county seat of Mineral County, where it becomes known as Mineral Street. In the center of the city, located 7 miles (11 km) north of US 50, US 220 intersects WV 46. At the northern edge of Keyser, US 220 crosses the North Branch Potomac River via Memorial Bridge, leaving West Virginia and entering Maryland.\n\nUS 220 enters Maryland at McCoole, Allegany County, and becomes known as McMullen Highway. In McCoole, US 220 intersects the eastern terminus of Maryland Route 135 (MD 135). Past MD 135, US 220 turns to the northeast, paralleling the North Branch of the Potomac River to the east. 12 miles (19 km) into Maryland, with West Virginia visible to the right, US 220 intersects the western terminus of MD 956, a connector to a secondary state highway in West Virginia. Continuing north in the river valley, US 220 enters Cresaptown, where US 220 intersects with the east end of MD 53. 4 miles (6 km) north of Cresaptown, US 220 joins with I-68 and US 40, known as the National Freeway west of Cumberland and the Baltimore Pike east of the city.\nThe three routes head across Wills Creek and through Cumberland to exit 46, US 220 turns north again onto an upgraded roadway opened to traffic on September 18, 2000. The highway heads north for a few miles before crossing the Mason–Dixon Line into Pennsylvania. The section of US 220 between I-68 and I-80 near Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, is designated as Corridor O by the Appalachian Development Highway System.\n\nAfter crossing the state line from Maryland, US 220 runs north through Bedford County as Cumberland Road to Bedford, where it divides into US 220 Business, which enters the town of Bedford, and the main branch, which joins the southern terminus of I-99 at an interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-70 and I-76). I-99 heads north along US 220, and the resulting overlap duplex continues northeast along the west side of Dunning and Brush mountains. The freeway continues into Blair County, where it serves the towns of Altoona and Tyrone. I-99 and US 220 soon enter Centre County in the vicinity of Port Matilda. Here, US 322 joins the alignment and all three routes continue eastward for to State College.\n\nNorth of State College, US 322 diverges eastward at the Mount Nittany Interchange while US 220 and I-99 continue northward toward Pleasant Gap. The concurrency travels past Bellefonte to I-80, where I-99 currently ends. All of I-99 is known as the Bud Shuster Highway, named for the U.S. Representative who championed the I-99 designation. US 220 follows I-80 eastward for to Clinton County before exiting northward as a recently upgraded, short section of super-two limited-access highway before once again becoming a limited-access expressway traveling through the east side of Lock Haven. Past Lock Haven, US 220 runs alongside the west branch of the Susquehanna River, becoming an at-grade road north of Jersey Shore for 6.2 miles until it reaches W Fourth St south of Williamsport. It finally becomes a freeway once again at Williamsport as it joins I-180, here an east–west highway, and US 15.\nI-180 and US 220 head through the center of the city, briefly overlapping with US 15 in the downtown district, before splitting near Halls Station. The Interstate Highway turns to the south, following the Susquehanna River toward Muncy while US 220 exits the expressway onto a two-lane road that first travels east to Hughesville, a borough based around US 220's junction with Pennsylvania Route 405 (PA 405). US 220 heads generally northeastward from Hughesville, passing through Laporte on its way to Dushore. It is here that the route changes directions for the final time, assuming a northerly alignment that it largely follows for the remainder of its routing. A short section of super-two limited-access freeway is used to bypass Towanda, a borough north of Dushore on the banks of the main Susquehanna River. One interchange along this stretch links US 220 to US 6.\n\nPast Towanda, US 220 continues on a northerly path, paralleling the Susquehanna River to the borough of Athens. Here, US 220 becomes a freeway for the final time at an exit with PA 199, the main north–south highway through the neighboring boroughs of Athens, Sayre, and South Waverly. US 220 bypasses all three to the west, proceeding toward the New York state line. Just south of the border, US 220 ends at I-86/NY 17 (the Southern Tier Expressway).\n\nUS 220 was assigned as part of the establishment of the U.S. Highway System on November 11, 1926. The route began at US 40 in Cumberland, Maryland, and followed its modern corridor northeast to Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The highway turned north here, proceeding northward along the current US 15 corridor to its end at the New York–Pennsylvania border in Lawrenceville. US 220 did not directly connect to US 20, its implied parent; instead, the connection was intended to be made via US 120, a route extending from Philadelphia to US 20 in Erie. As originally planned, US 120 and US 220 would overlap between Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, and Williamsport. East of Williamsport, the modern US 220 corridor was served by US 120 from Williamsport to Muncy and US 711 between Muncy and the New York state line at South Waverly. When US 120 was signed in 1927, it was altered to run only from Reading to Ridgway, isolating both US 120 and US 220 from US 20.\nIn early 1927, US 220 absorbed the Muncy–South Waverly section of US 711, which had continued south from Muncy to meet US 11 in Northumberland, Pennsylvania. From Williamsport to Muncy, US 220 utilized what had been planned as US 120. Former US 220 from Williamsport north to the state line at Lawrenceville became part of an extension of US 111, which was also assigned to the piece of old US 711 south of Muncy. Most of this alignment of US 220 followed previously unnumbered roads, save for two areas in the vicinity of Bald Eagle and Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where it followed short pieces of PA 5 and PA 4, respectively. Both routes were assigned in 1924.\n\nThe largely intrastate route was significantly extended over the course of the next decade. It was extended past Cumberland to the Virginia state line by 1930, through Virginia to the North Carolina state line by 1935, and finally to US 1 in Rockingham, North Carolina, by 1941. In Virginia, US 220 replaced the piece of SR 18 north of Covington, all of SR 12 (Clifton Forge to near Roanoke), and all of US 311 in Virginia, originally designated in 1926 to run from US 11 in Roanoke south along SR 33 to North Carolina.\n\nUS 220 was extended into New York—albeit for only a half-mile (0.8 km)—by 1948. At the time, the route followed Keystone Avenue through Sayre to South Waverly, where it turned onto Bradford Street. The highway turned again after three blocks, proceeding north on Pennsylvania Avenue to the state line and into the adjacent village of Waverly, New York. US 220 ended five blocks into New York at an intersection with Chemung Street, then part of NY 17.\n\nWhen the Southern Tier Expressway was built, Chemung Street became a section of NY 17C as NY 17 was moved onto the freeway. NY 17C was truncated to a junction with NY 34 several blocks to the east in the late 2000s, leaving US 220 isolated from the rest of New York's numbered route system. In 2017, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved a request by New York and Pennsylvania to delete US 220 north of I-86/NY 17.\n\nThe Athens–Sayre Bypass, a limited-access highway bypassing the boroughs of Athens and Sayre, was completed in 1973. US 220 was realigned to follow the new highway, which began southwest of Athens and ended at a junction with Chemung Street less than north of the state line. Most of US 220's former alignment became PA 199; however, the northernmost part of PA 199 was assigned to an alternate alignment to the east on Mohawk and Spring streets, both of which were already state-maintained. The Pennsylvania Avenue (former US 220) state line crossing was dismantled as part of the Southern Tier Expressway's construction.\n\nUS 220 originally continued northeast of Port Matilda, along the at-grade Appalachian Thruway to an interchange with I-80 near Milesburg. US 220 was realigned onto US 322 and a limited-access highway running from State College to Bellefonte on May 30, 2003, at which point the previous route via Milesburg was redesignated as US 220 Alternate. The latter route was extended to Tyrone when US 220 was moved onto a new section of I-99 from Tyrone to Port Matilda in 2008. In the future, US 220 and I-99 will form a concurrency throughout much of central Pennsylvania, from the interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike at Bedford to the intersection with US 15 at Williamsport. I-99 will leave US 220 here to follow US 15 north to Corning, New York.\n\nThe southern terminus of US 220 in Rockingham was originally at the intersection of East Broad and Hancock streets (US 1 and US 74), where a sign said \"US 220 Ends Here\". From here, US 220 went north on current US 74 Business, Old Ellerbe Road and Billy Covington Road before rejoining its current alignment north of the city. The four-lane portion of US 220 between Ellerbe and Rockingham roads was completed in two sections; the northern one, ending at the north end of Billy Covington Road, was finished first in the 1960s. Some of the old alignment is still visible at the north end of Billy Covington Road.\n\nParts of US 220 in Virginia south of Roanoke follow what used to be called the Carolina Road or the Great Road. These roads, stretching from the current day Philadelphia area to what is now Atlanta (southern end of the Appalachian Mountains), were mostly roads built over old Indian trails. Another branch went west from present day Roanoke to Cumberland Gap. Parts of this road in Henry County are now known as the Old Stage Road. It crossed the Smith River just north of the current US 220 crossing. From Henry County the road crossed the Mayo River and headed towards Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Mayo River crossing is still visible. In Martinsville, Virginia, US 220 originally passed through downtown Martinsville on West Church Street and Starling Avenue. It was moved onto the newly built Memorial Boulevard the late 1940s and onto a new bypass around Collinsville and Martinsville in the mid-1970s. The alignment through Colinsville and Martinsviile remains signed as Business US-220.\n\nIn the vicinity of Cumberland, Maryland, US 220 originally proceeded into the city limits on Greene Street. It crossed Wills Creek via Baltimore Street before connecting to Mechanic Street. From Mechanic Street to the city limits, traffic was split between two parallel one-way streets, with northbound traffic carried by Frederick Street and southbound traffic carried by a narrower Bedford Street until the streets merged as Bedford Road, now unsigned MD 807, north of the city. The highway continued on a northeasterly track to connect to Pennsylvania at the Mason–Dixon Line.\n\n\n\n"}

Home to an important mission of Bethlehemites, they maintained a convalescent clinic there until their papal suppression in 1821. The area then became home to a large farmer's market and its relative elevation began attracting development. The market was renamed in honor of the recently promulgated Argentine Constitution in 1856 and the neighborhood, long centered on the market, soon acquired the name.\n\nWork began in 1864 on the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway led the opening of a station at the market and with it, the rapid growth of the area as an immigrants' quarter. Groundbreaking for a new railway terminal in 1885 was accompanied by the razing of the market in favor of Constitución Plaza. A non-profit clinic opened by the Anglican Reverend Barton Lodge in 1844 became the British Hospital in 1887 (still the borough's largest). The neighborhood was subsequently home to Hipólito Yrigoyen, a co-founder of the centrist Radical Civic Union in 1891 who tirelessly campaigned for and, in 1912, won the right to universal (male) suffrage in Argentina and the secret ballot. Elected president in 1916, his Constitución home was ransacked during a coup against him in 1930.\n\nThe mayor appointed in 1976 by Argentina's last dictatorship, Osvaldo Cacciatore, had plans drawn up for eight freeways within the city proper, three of which were finished. The two busiest, the 25 de Mayo and 9 de Julio Freeways, meet at a junction north of Constitución station. The structures, though a great benefit to commuters, led to the exodus of much of the neighborhood's middle class.\n\n"}

However, unlike other nearby canyon neighborhoods, Laurel Canyon has houses lining one side of the main street most of the way up to Mulholland Drive. There are many side roads that branch off the main canyon, but most are not through streets, reinforcing the self-contained nature of the neighborhood. Some of the main side streets are Mount Olympus, Kirkwood, Wonderland Avenue, Willow Glen, and Lookout Mountain Avenue. The zip code for a portion of the neighborhood is 90046.\n\nLaurel Canyon Boulevard is an important North-South route between: West Hollywood, Hollywood, and Central Los Angeles; and Studio City and the eastern San Fernando Valley. The canyon's division between the two regions is defined by Mulholland Drive.\n\nThe Laurel Canyon neighborhood is generally bounded by West Hollywood to the west and south, Hollywood to the east, and Studio City to the north.\n\nThe Laurel Canyon area was inhabited by the Tongva people, a regional tribe of the indigenous peoples of California, for thousands of years. A spring-fed stream flowed year-round providing water.\n\nThe reliable water supply attracted colonial Spanish ranchers who started grazing sheep on the hillsides in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. After the Mexican–American War and the advent of U.S. statehood for California in 1850, the area was settled by Americans interested in water rights.\n\nUntil the twentieth century, passage up the canyon was made on foot or by mule. In 1907, an 82-mile dirt road, later named Laurel Canyon Boulevard, was built. It ran up the canyon, dividing at what is now Lookout Mountain Road; the left road went up to the summit of Lookout Mountain, and the right branch of the road went to the top of the Santa Monica Mountains and then down to the San Fernando Valley.\n\nIn 1908, the Lookout Mountain Park and Water Co. was formed to purchase 280 acres on Lookout Mountain, just west of Laurel Canyon, subdivided and marketed as mountain vacation properties. On Aug. 14, 1908, the \"Los Angeles Times\" announced that the company would build Lookout Mountain Inn at the summit of Lookout Mountain and Sunset Plaza roads, and Lookout Mountain Park, Bungalow Land at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Lookout Mountain Avenue and Wonderland Park. Two years later, the company widened the winding dirt road to the top of Lookout Mountain where they built the Lookout Mountain Inn.\n\nIn 1912, Charles Mann, a real estate developer and Richard Shoemaker, an engineer, built a trackless electric trolley bus line which ran between the Laurel Canyon Pacific Electric Shuttle stop at the foot of Laurel Canyon at Sunset Boulevard, The Laurel Canyon Pacific Electric Shuttle ran from the foot of Laurel Canyon at Sunset Boulevard to Gardner Junction at Gardner Street and Sunset Boulevard, Beverly Hills line of the Pacific Electric Railway station. (1451 N Gardner St, West Hollywood, CA 90046 up Laurel Canyon Road from Sunset Boulevard to the Tavern at the base of Lookout Mountain Road, a road house serving visitors. \nThe car had two trolley poles, one to a positive overhead wire and one to a ground overhead wire, and was able to sway to either side of the street, only using power uphill. The trolley was actually a 1912 Oldsmobile with an electric motor and 10-passenger capacity. The overhead wires came down and the service was replaced by Stanley Steamers about 1915. Until 1918, the trackless trolley traveled up and down Laurel Canyon to meet the half hour schedule to Los Angeles. It was insufficiently patronized and discontinued when Pacific Electric stopped running streetcars between Gardner Junction and Laurel Canyon Boulevard, and demand failed to support it.\n\nOn October 26, 1918, a fire, fanned by strong Santa Ana winds, burned about 200 acres and totally destroyed Lookout Mountain Inn at the summit of Lookout Mountain Avenue and Sunset Plaza Drive. Another major fire occurred in July 1959, destroying some 38 homes.\n\nAs the roads were improved access was possible by automobile.\n\nNow a vacant lot, the corner of Lookout Mountain Avenue and Laurel Canyon Blvd (2401 Laurel Canyon Blvd) is where the \"Tavern\", a famous 1915 \"Log Cabin\" mansion stood, with its 80-foot living room, floor to ceiling fireplace, bowling alley and indoor sunken swimming pool. It was once occupied by silent film star Tom Mix but spent years on the rental market. In 1968 it was rented by Frank Zappa who turned it into a recording studio and celebrity hangout. However, Zappa moved out after six months. The house burned to the ground on Halloween 1981.\n\nDirectly across the street, at 2400 Laurel Canyon Blvd., is site of the home, long-gone, that magician Harry Houdini may have rented around 1919. It was originally the Walker estate.\n\nLaurel Canyon became a nexus of counterculture activity and attitudes in the mid-late 1960s and early 1970s, becoming famous as home to many of L.A.'s rock musicians, such as Joni Mitchell; Frank Zappa; Jim Morrison of The Doors; Carole King; The Byrds; Buffalo Springfield; Canned Heat; John Mayall; members of the band The Eagles; the band Love; Neil Young; Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys as well as James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, Harry Nilsson; and Micky Dolenz & Peter Tork of The Monkees. Tork's home was considered one of Laurel Canyon's biggest party houses with all-night, drug-fueled sleepovers, well attended by the hippest musicians and movie stars of the era.\n\nJohn Phillips of the Mamas & the Papas took inspiration from their home in Laurel Canyon for the song \"Twelve Thirty (Young Girls Are Coming to the Canyon)”, released in 1967. The following year, blues artist John Mayall recorded and released the album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" based on his experiences during a vacation that he spent in the Canyon.\n\nPerhaps most famously, the area and its denizens served as inspiration for Joni Mitchell's third album, \"Ladies of the Canyon\", released in 1970. The house she lived in was immortalized in the Crosby, Stills, and Nash song, \"Our House\" (1970), written by her then-lover Graham Nash. The group are reputed to have first sung together in Mitchell's living room.\n\nLegendary rock photographer Henry Diltz was also a resident and used the scenic Canyon backdrop for many of his historic photos of rock musicians casually socializing. Several of his photos became iconic representations of the 1960s and 1970s' West Coast music scene; others became famous album sleeve covers, such as CSN's debut album, \"Crosby, Stills & Nash\" (photographed in nearby West Hollywood).\n\nMusician Josh Tillman has said that his output under the moniker Father John Misty was partly inspired by a relocation to and personal reinvention in Laurel Canyon. The song \"I Went to the Store One Day,\" from his 2015 album \"I Love You, Honeybear\", recounts the story of how Tillman met his wife, Emma, in the parking lot of the Laurel Canyon Country Store.\n\nOn July 1, 1981, three members and one associate of the Wonderland Gang, so-called because they were based at 8763 Wonderland Avenue, died in the Wonderland murders (also known as the \"Four on the Floor murders\" or the \"Laurel Canyon murders\"). \"Salon\" reports: \"The massacre took place just down the street from what was then the home of Jerry Brown, who was California’s governor at the time. And 8763 Wonderland Ave. itself is said to have been inhabited at one time by Paul Revere and the Raiders.\"\n\n\n\n"}

On 20 July 1907, she became Empress of Korea when her husband ascended the throne after the forced abdication of his father, Emperor Gwangmu. The Empress was demoted by the Japanese government by the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty of 1910 and thereafter officially known as Her Majesty Queen Yi of Korea (this title, however, was ignored in Korea).\n\nEmpress Sunjeong became a widow 24 April 1926, when Emperor Yunghui died without issue at the Changdeok Palace in Seoul. Emperor Yunghui had been rendered infertile (and was also said to be mentally disabled) by poisoning in the Coffee Poisoning Plot.\n\nDuring the Korean War, Empress Sunjeong stayed in Changdeok Palace as long as she could in the face of advancing forces from North Korea. During the war, the soldiers of North Korea invaded the palace but she reproved them and drove them all out. She then escaped secretly to the Unhyeon Palace when the war situation became too serious. As the war progressed she moved to Busan with other Imperial family members, including Princess Hui (wife of Prince Wanheung). According to \"The World is One\", Princess Yi Pangja's autobiography, Empress Sunjeong went to Busan on foot.\n\nAfter the war, the new government of President Rhee Syng-man, jealous of the popularity of the Imperial House, prevented Empress Sunjeong from entering the Changdeok Palace. She was kept imprisoned in Suin Hall, a narrow and unsuitable cottage in Jeongneung, Seoul. After a change in government in 1961 she returned to Nakseon Hall, Changdeok Palace with her dutiful ladies-in-waiting Park Chang-bok (d.1981), Kim Myung-gil (d.1983) and Sung Ok-yeom (d.2001), and five other staff. \n\nEmpress Sunjeong became a Buddhist in her later years.

The nephew of Halifax businessman Alexander Keith he worked for a time as a clerk in his uncle's brewery.\n\nDuring the American Civil War Keith acted mostly as a blockade runner and courier. He helped a Confederate sympathiser escape British capture in the Chesapeake Affair. He was also involved with Luke Blackburn in a plot to send clothes infected with yellow fever to northern cities in the United States.\n\nIn 1865, he swindled his associates-in-crime and fled to St. Louis, Missouri, settling finally on the prairie. There, he married Cecelia Paris, a milliner's daughter from St. Louis.\n\nHunted down by one of his victims, Keith fled again with Cecelia to Germany, hobnobbing with wealthy socialites and Saxon generals under the assumed name of \"William King Thomas\". When the couple began to run out of money, Keith concocted a plot to blow up passenger ships and collect the insurance money. This led to a major catastrophe in Bremerhaven, in 1875, when a time bomb he had placed in a shipping barrel accidentally went off on the dock, killing 40 to 80 people. According to one witness: \"A mushroom-shaped column of smoke rose approximately 200 meters above the harbor. Everywhere people were crying and whimpering beside ruins. The entire pier was covered in soot: it was like the gateway to hell.\" At the time, the deed was called the \"crime of the century.\"\n\nKeith was aboard another ship in Bremerhaven at the time of the \"Mosel\" explosion. He went to his suite and shot himself. He died a week later. After the tragedy was revealed as a murder/insurance scam on a large scale, the disappearances of other ships were investigated to see if Keith and his possible associates were involved. One was the disappearance of the \"SS City of Boston\", which vanished in January 1870. The allegation was proven to be false. He was reputed to have been buried in an unmarked grave in Bremerhaven. His severed head was kept at the Bremer Police Museum and was destroyed by Allied bombing in 1945. Newspapers called it \"The Thomas Crime.\"\n\nRegarding his time bomb, Keith's biographer Ann Larabee wrote: \"Keith was not responsible for the political passion of these violent political groups, but he played a role in showing them a means of action.\"\n\n\n"}

He was educated at various private schools in Baltimore, and entered St. Timothy's Academy in Catonsville, Maryland in 1846. He and his twin brother, Samuel, remained there until 1850, when their father's declining health and weakening financial situation made it necessary for the boys to leave school. Samuel eventually moved to New York City to make his way in business there, while William stayed in Baltimore to manage his father's warehouses.\n\nIn 1857, William formed a partnership with his other brother, Irvine Keyser under the name \"Keyser Brothers\". He was active in the firm, as well as the Abbott Iron Co. and the Baltimore Copper Company, throughout the 1860s.\n\nOn November 11, 1858, he married Mary (Mollie) Brent, daughter of the well-known Baltimore lawyer, Robert Brent. They had three children who lived to adulthood: Robert Brent Keyser, Henry Irvine Keyser, and Mathilde Lawrence Keyser.\n\nIn 1870, William Keyser became involved with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, taking a position as second vice-president during the term of its president, John Work Garrett. The town of Keyser, West Virginia was named for him. While at the B&O, he was instrumental in labor negotiations during the 1871 and 1877 railroad workers strikes. In 1881, Keyser left the B&O. His action was precipitated by Garrett's decision to promote his son, Robert Garrett, over Keyser.\n\nKeyser next ventured into copper manufacturing. In 1882, the court appointed him to oversee the financial affairs of Pope and Cole, a local copper processor. The company had declared bankruptcy, and Keyser, as one of their largest creditors, had a vested interest in seeing them regain solvency. His association with Pope and Cole piqued his interest in the copper industry. He eventually reestablished Pope & Cole as the Baltimore Copper Company and purchased the Baltimore Smelting and Rolling Company. His entry into copper production allowed him to amass a fortune larger than if he had stayed with the railroad.\n\nKeyser put his money to many philanthropic uses. He donated funds for a hall at Hannah More Academy in Reisterstown, and was instrumental in the founding of Johns Hopkins University's Homewood campus. Material in the Keyser-Wyman Papers recounts his association with his cousin, William Wyman, who donated a large portion on the land, and their efforts on behalf of the University.\n\nBefore his death in June, 1904, Keyser was appointed a member of the Citizens' Emergency Committee which was charged with developing a plan for rebuilding the downtown after the calamitous Baltimore fire of February 1904. The Committee prepared street and dock improvement plans, which were adopted.\n\nKeyser died suddenly as a brain aneurysm burst at his summer home, Brentwood, in Reistertown on June 3, 1904. He was buried in the family plat at Baltimore's historic Green Mount Cemetery.

It was first found in Myanmar by British mineralogist and gem dealer Arthur C.D. Pain who misidentified it as ruby, until it was discovered as a new gemstone in the 1950s. When it was confirmed as a new mineral species, the mineral was named after him.\n\nThe chemical makeup of painite contains calcium, zirconium, boron, aluminium and oxygen (CaZrAlO(BO)). The mineral also contains trace amounts of chromium and vanadium, which are responsible for Painite's typically orange-red to brownish-red color, similar to topaz. The crystals are naturally hexagonal in shape, and, until late 2004, only two had been cut into faceted gemstones.\n\nExtensive exploration in the Mogok region has identified several new painite occurrences that have been vigorously explored resulting in several thousand new available painite specimens.\n"}

{"id": "2003561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003561", "title": "Carystus", "text": "Carystus\n\nCarystus (; , near modern Karystos) was a polis (city-state) on ancient Euboea. It was situated on the south coast of the island, at the foot of Mount Oche. It is mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships in the \"Iliad\", as controlled by the Abantes. The name also appears in the Linear B tablets as \"\"ka-ru-to\"\" (identified as \"Carystus\"). Thucydides writes that the town was founded by Dryopes. Its name was derived from Carystus, the son of Cheiron.\n\nA Persian force landed at Carystus in 490 BCE and quickly subdued its inhabitants. Soon after the Battle of Salamis the Athenian fleet led by Themistocles extorted money from the city.\n\nSoon afterward Carystus refused to join the Delian League. The Athenians wanted Carystus to join the Delian League, but seeming as though it had been under Persian control, they refused. Athens would not accept a refusal, so they attacked and plundered Carystus. This forced Carystus to side with the Delian league. Athens employed this tactic frequently, as it was said to be better for the league. This way, a Greek city-state could not side with Persia and offer their city as a base, and also could not get the advantages of a Persian-free Greece without paying their share. The creation of the Delian league leads to the imperial nature of Athens that fueled the Peloponnesian War. Imperial nature tends to take on a modern association, however with the creation of the league essentially people of uneducated agricultural background were given the right to vote in the assembly. This version of Athenian democracy took on a role that allowed for a tyrannical nature of a seemingly egalitarian ideal. The league demanded submission to create a unified Greece, the only problem is that instead of creating a standing army or improved military strength to prevent further invasion, the Athenians under the direction of Pericles started the Periclean building projects that squandered funds and glorified Athens and Greece in their defeat of Persia. This misapplication of tribute from Attican city-states created the rejection of this idea by Sparta, and subsequently the Peloponnesian War, not securing Greece from an outside Persian attack, but opening it for an internal rejection of the league.\n\nThe Carystians fought on the side of the Athenians in the Lamian War. They espoused the side of the Romans in the war against Philip V of Macedon.\n\nCarystus was chiefly celebrated for its marble, which was in much request at Rome. Strabo places the quarries at Marmarium, a place upon the coast near Carystus, opposite Halae Araphenides in Attica; but the marks of the quarries have been found upon Mt. Oche, where seven entire columns, apparently on the spot where they had been quarried were observed, and at the distance of three miles from the sea. This marble is the Cipollino marble of the Romans – a green marble, with white zones. At Carystus the mineral asbestos was also obtained, which was hence called the Carystian stone.\n\nAs an episcopal see, Carystus was initially a suffragan of Corinth, but in the 9th century it came to be associated with Athens and appears as such in the \"Notitia Episcopatuum\" composed under Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise (886-912). A bishop of the see called Cyriacus was one of the signatories of the letter of the episcopate of the Corinthian province to Emperor Leo I the Thracian in 458.\n\nNo longer a residential bishopric, Carystus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\n\n"}

As the bawdy character Mo McCackie, Rene was one of the most well-known and successful Australian comedians of the 20th century.\n\nA 1927 recording of Rene and Nat Phillips performing as Stiffy and Mo, called \"The Sailors\", was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's Sounds of Australia registry in 2011.\n\nBorn in Adelaide, South Australia, Rene was the fourth of seven children of a Dutch and English Jewish parents. Named Henry van de Sluice (later spelt variously \"van der Sluys\"), aged 10 \"Harry\" won a singing competition at an Adelaide market and in 1905 appeared professionally in the pantomime, \"Sinbad the Sailor\", at the Theatre Royal and later at the Tivoli, in a black face, singing and dancing act.\n\nAbout 1905 the Sluice family moved to Melbourne, Harry (as he was called) was briefly an apprentice jockey and thereafter maintained a keen interest in racing. Despite his father's opposition, in July 1908 he secured an engagement with James Brennan's vaudeville at the Gaiety Theatre. Of medium height with a distinctly Jewish profile, with dark hair, a pale smooth complexion and large soulful brown eyes, 'Boy Roy' (his stage name) had an appealing pathos. Most of his spare time was spent studying the famous English music-hall comedians at Harry Rickards' Opera House. Unsuccessful in Melbourne, he appeared at Brennan's National Amphitheatre, Sydney in 1910 and had adopted the new stage name Roy Rene (Rene after a famous French clown). Later he joined J. C. Bain's suburban vaudeville in Sydney and toured New South Wales with bush companies.\n\nWhile playing at Bain's Princess Theatre, Railway Square, Sydney, in 1914 Rene was noticed by producer Ben Fuller, who engaged him to tour New Zealand. He developed his unique style and perfected the black and white make-up which became his trademark. Returning to Sydney in November 1915, he joined Albert Bletsoe's revue company at the Fullers' National Theatre in Sydney. In July 1916 Rene ('Mo') teamed up with comedian Nat Phillips ('Stiffy'), and the duo became the famous Stiffy and Mo, renowned for their larrikin comedy. They opened at the Sydney Princess, were an instant success, and in December moved to the Grand Opera House, playing in the spectacular pantomime \"The Bunyip\", followed by a season in Melbourne. On 29 March 1917 at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, Sydney, Henry van der Sluice married an actress Dorothy Davis; childless, they were divorced in May 1929.\n\n'Stiffy and Mo' played on the Fullers' circuit with enormous success until 1925 when, after a confrontation in Adelaide, they split up. Rene continued his tour at the Luxor, Perth, with a member of his company, Mike Connors, as his straight man.\n\nIn 1925–26 Rene appeared with outstanding success in a straight play, \"Give and Take\", starring American comedian Harry Green, in Melbourne and Sydney. Back on the Tivoli circuit in May 1926, he was partnered by Fred Bluett in an act entitled 'The Admiral and the Sailor'. Fuller persuaded him to rejoin Phillips in 1927; once again 'Stiffy and Mo' broke box-office records, but the partnership finally broke up in New Zealand in 1928. Rene returned to Fuller's Theatre in Sydney with his own company, Mo and his Merrymakers. In Sydney on 3 July 1929 Rene married again, this time to Sadie Gale (1902–1997), a member of his company. Six months later he collapsed with peritonitis while appearing in Frank Neil's revue \"Clowns in Clover\", in Melbourne and nearly died.\nHe returned to the theatre in mid-1930 for H. D. McIntosh in a revue, \"Pot Luck\", at the Tivoli, Melbourne, but business was bad because of the Great Depression. Rene and Sadie resorted to a tour of Hoyts' suburban theatres in Sydney, followed by a brief vaudeville season in New Zealand, but the Fullers were disbanding their revue companies. In April 1931 Rene joined Connors and his wife Queenie Paul, who had successfully opened low-priced, weekly-change variety at the New Haymarket Theatre, Sydney. By 1932 the Connors had taken over the Melbourne Tivoli and converted the old Sydney Opera House to the new Tivoli, where Rene and Jim Gerald continued to appear after the Connors sold out in mid-1933. In 1934 he made his only film, \"Strike Me Lucky\", for Ken G. Hall at Cinesound; however film was not his medium, as rapport with a live audience was essential to his comedy.\n\nEarly next year Rene played in Ernest C. Rolls's lavish revue, \"Rhapsodies of 1935\", at the Apollo Theatre, Melbourne. In 1935–36, in partnership with Connors and Paul, he appeared in variety in Sydney and Melbourne, then returned to the Tivoli at the instigation of English producer Wallace Parnell. By early 1939 Rene was in conflict with Frank Neil, general manager of the Tivoli, who terminated his contract: on Neil's death in January 1941 Parnell immediately reinstated him. Throughout World War II Rene played to packed houses, but his contract was not renewed in 1945.\n\nTurning to radio in 1946, Rene signed a contract with Colgate-Palmolive Pty Ltd to appear in \"Calling the Stars\" with a live audience at the 2GB theatrette in Sydney; his much-acclaimed \"McCackie Mansion\" segment was a highlight. Living at 13 Coffin Street, 'Mo' was the suburban householder whose life was made miserable by relatives, neighbours and friends. He later appeared in \"Cavalcade\" with Jack Davey, and as Professor McCackie in \"It Pays to be Ignorant\".\n\nRene briefly returned to the stage in 1949 in the revue, \"McCackie Moments\", at the Kings in Melbourne. By the time his radio contract expired in 1950 he was plagued by ill health; he appeared once in \"McCackie Manor\" for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1951 and in 1952 starred in \"The New Atlantic Show\", again capturing a nationwide audience.\n\nSurvived by his wife, son and daughter, Rene died of atherosclerotic heart disease at his home at Kensington, New South Wales, on 22 November 1954 and was buried in the Jewish section of Rookwood Cemetery.\n\nAlthough widely unknown overseas, 'Mo' was hailed by visiting celebrities such as Dame Sybil Thorndike and Jack Benny as a comic genius in the company of Charlie Chaplin. Lecherous, leering and ribald, he epitomized the Australian 'lair', always trying to 'make a quid' or to 'knock off a Sheila'; yet some of his funniest moments were when he was being 'posh', as in his outrageous parody of Noël Coward's \"Private Lives\" with Sadie.\n\nHe was a Freemason.\n\nThe memory of Rene lives on in the Mo Awards, presented annually for excellence in live performance. The statuette presented to the recipients is in the form of Rene in his Mo McCackie persona.\n\nGarry McDonald played Roy Rene/Mo in the 1977 theatre production \"Young Mo\", written by Steve J. Spears, and on television in the 1980s.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2003582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003582", "title": "Snapcase", "text": "Snapcase\n\nSnapcase is an American hardcore punk band, from Buffalo, New York, United States. Their records were released on the Chicago record label, Victory Records. During the course of the band's initial run of fourteen years, they released six studio albums before disbanding in 2005.\n\nThe band was originally conceived in 1989 in a basement in West Seneca, NY and was named Solid State. In 1989, the lineup was guitarist Scott Dressler, then 15 years of age, 17-year-old drummer Mike Kimaid, Daryl Taberski, age 18 on bass, and Tiger Balduf, the eldest at 19 on vocals. Prior to recording their first demo as Solid State on January 30, 1990, \"Quest for Reality\", Tiger Balduf left the band to get married, and Mike Kimaid left to join the Lockport, NY based band The Watchmen. Drafted to take their places were Chris Galas on vocals and Peter Dawidzik on drums. Soon after recording, Peter Dawidzik left the band to go to school. On May 22, 1990, Solid State recorded their second demo, \"Accept Your Fate\", with their friend Mike Lampe, who had assisted with the previous demo, as well. At the time of recording, the band was composed of Chris Galas on vocals, Scott Dressler playing guitar, Jason Kourkounis on drums, and Daryl Taberski on bass.\n\nDuring the spring of 1991, Solid State went through a big lineup shift; Kourkounis left the band to pursue other musical interests, and Kimaid rejoined the band along with The Watchmen guitarist Joe Smith, making the band a five-piece. After these changes to their lineup, the band decided to change their name to Snapcase. Between the years of 1991 and 1992, Snapcase recorded two demos with Dennis Fura, \"Break The Silence\" and \"King of the Mountain\". In 1992 the band was signed to Chicago hardcore label Victory Records and recorded their first 7 inch, \"Comatose\", with Mike Sac and Robby Takac that year.\n\nThere was a line-up change following the release date of the single; Taberski moved over to vocals, replacing Chris Galas, Bob Whiteside from Buffalo, NY band Support took over on bass, and Jon Salemi, who played drums in Support, joined to replace Joe Smith, who left for school. In 1993, Kimaid left the band after partially recording the band's first album and was replaced by former Buffalo, NY based Slugfest drummer, Timothy Redmond, who performed on the rest of the tracks. Snapcase's first full-length recording, \"Lookinglasself\", was released in 1993 and was recorded with Don Fury and Fred Betschen.\n\nIn early 1995, the band released the \"Steps\" EP, which they recorded with Fred Betschen. This was the last recording to feature Scott Dressler, who left the band in the fall of 1995 to go to graduate school. He was replaced by Frank Vicario of Buffalo, NY band Fadeaway. In the summer of 1996, \"The California Takeover\" was released which featured live recordings from Snapcase, Earth Crisis, and Strife.\n\n\"Progression Through Unlearning\" was recorded and mixed in a period of two weeks with producer Steve Evetts at Trax East in New Jersey. Guitarist Jon Salemi recorded the album with \"full-blown chicken pox\" and noted that the album's recording was \"very, very quick.\" The album was released in April 1997.\n\nThe album is considered to be revolutionary by many fans of hardcore. The band set out on a summer tour, and featured performances on the Vans Warped Tour. In the fall of 1997, the band took some time off so that members could pursue education. In 1998, the band resumed touring, and was the opening band on the fall tour of the Deftones and Quicksand. They also went into the studio with Brian McTernan in the fall of 1998 to record a cover of the Bad Brains \"I\", released on Century Media's \"Never Give In\" tribute record, and a split EP with Boysetsfire that was released in the summer of 1999. These were the last recordings with bassist Bob Whiteside. He was replaced by Dustin Perry, formerly of the Minneapolis, MN band Threadbare. They headlined Hellfest that summer in Syracuse, NY.\n\n\"Designs for Automotion\", the band's third full-length album, was recorded in the summer of 1999 with Steve Evetts was released in January 2000. They spent most of 2000 on tour, performing on the Deconstruction tour in Europe with NOFX and playing the main stage of the Vans Warped Tour in the summer. Ben Lythberg began playing drums for the band during the fall, winter and spring while Redmond finished his master's degree.\n\nIn 2002, the band focused their creative energy on crafting their new album, \"End Transmission\", with Brian McTernan at Salad Days Studios. The result became their fourth full-length album, which was released in September 2002. Redmond officially left the band soon after the release of the album and was permanently replaced by Lythberg. Snapcase toured that fall with Boysetsfire and Atreyu. Their final international tour was in early 2003. They opened for Bad Religion and Finch in the spring of 2003. \"Bright Flashes\" was released in November 2003. Featuring songs that were recorded for the conceptual \"End Transmission\" album, it also included covers of songs by Helmet, Devo, and Jane's Addiction, and 3 remixes of songs from \"End Transmission\".\n\nThe band announced in the fall of 2004 that they would be disbanding, and would play their final show in January 2005 in Buffalo, NY. The final show featured appearances by nearly every member who had ever played in the band. Redmond, Dressler, and Whiteside joined Salemi and Taberski for a performance of the song \"Lookinglasself\", and original vocalist Chris Galas joined them for the song \"Comatose\".\n\nMost of the band members of Snapcase found jobs after disbanding. Timothy Redmond taught AP Government, Global History, The Turbulent Sixties, and Human Rights and Genocide at Williamsville East High School and Scott Dressler was an Assistant Professor of Economics at Villanova University. After Snapcase dissolved, Vicario, Perry and Lythberg briefly participated in the band Attractive with Josh English from the band Sixgoingonseven. Vicario was working on new projects, but he primarily focused on his job in the technology industry.\n\nSnapcase reunited briefly in late 2007 on November 20 at Mohawk Place in their hometown of Buffalo, N.Y. and on November 24 and 25 at the Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn. The reunion shows were performed for the benefit of Callum Robbins and the release of the Anti-Matter Anthology book release.\n\nIn early 2010, Snapcase confirmed to play a series of shows in Europe including a performance at the 2010 Groezrock Festival in Belgium and also confirmed a reunion show with Sick of It All in Buffalo, N.Y., for May 8, 2010. Guitarist Frank Vicario later stated that the band had no intention of doing an extended reunion beyond the European and Buffalo, N.Y., shows.\n\nSnapcase was later forced to cancel their previously announced European reunion shows due to the eruption of Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull and its resulting ash plume engulfing much of Europe's airspace. The band remarked on their Twitter account that it could be at least three weeks before they'd be able to book different flights. The band still performed in their hometown of Buffalo, NY on May 8. European dates have since been rescheduled for July 2010. Snapcase performed at Fun Fun Fun Fest 2010 in Austin, Texas and played day four of Riot Fest 2010 in Chicago, Illinois at the Congress Theater.\n\nSick of It All announced that Snapcase would be supporting them at their 25th Anniversary show at New York City's Webster Hall on March 26, 2011.\n\nOn June 12, 2012, Snapcase announced that they have booked a September 14 show at the Outer Harbor in Buffalo, NY with Dropkick Murphys.\nOn July 23, 2015, Snapcase played the tenth annual This Is Hardcore Festival at Union Transfer in Philadelphia.\n\nOn February 26, 2016, Snapcase played a 25th anniversary show at the Town Ballroom in Buffalo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

M-55 is one of only three state highways that extend across the Lower Peninsula from Lake Huron to Lake Michigan; the others are M-46 and M-72. The highway crosses through rural forest and farmlands to connect Manistee with Tawas City. M-55 crosses two of the major rivers in the state. Two sections of the highway follow along freeways near Cadillac and West Branch. Running for through the state, M-55 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT).\n\nThe highway was first designated by July 1, 1919 along a portion of the current roadway. In a series of extensions, M-55 was lengthened to connect its current endpoints by the early 1930s. The trunkline has been rerouted in sections since that time resulting in the modern roadway alignment. One set of changes produced a business loop in the Houghton Lake area.\n\nM-55 starts at a three-way intersection with US Highway 31 (US 31) north of Manistee. The trunkline runs southeast on Caberfae Highway over the Manistee River and through the Peters and Highpoint bayous. The highway passes near the community of Eastlake before turning eastward through forest land. In eastern Manistee County, the roadway crosses the Pine River south of the Tippy Dam Pond in Wellston. M-55 intersects M-37 in western Wexford County southwest of the Caberfae Peaks Ski & Golf Resort. The roadway turns northeasterly along the south shore of Lake Mitchell where it then curves southeasterly to run concurrently along M-115 along the south shore of Lake Cadillac and through the south side of Cadillac. At the interchange with the US 131 freeway, M-55 merges north along the freeway, bypassing downtown Cadillac.\n\nOn the east side of town, M-55 leaves the freeway and turns east again running through the Pere Marquette State Forest along Watergate Road. When the highway meets M-66, M-55 joins M-66 and runs north through farmland. As the two highways approach Lake City, they run along the shore of Lake Missaukee and through downtown. M-55 turns east again along Houghton Lake Road, separating from M-66 north of the central business district. This section of trunkline passes through mixed farm and wood lands that transitions to mostly forests near Merritt. The road crosses the Muskegon River and follows Lake City Road into the outskirts of Houghton Lake. M-55 passes over the US 127 freeway and enters Houghton Lake Heights. There the highway runs southeasterly along the shores of Houghton Lake into downtown Houghton Lake. M-18 briefly joins M-55 through Prudenville on the east side of the lake, and M-55 follows West Branch Road as it continues east toward Interstate 75 (I-75).\nM-55 follows I-75 between exits 227 and 215, a distance of about . This section is the only part of M-55 that has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. From the end of the freeway concurrency, M-55 follows Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) into downtown West Branch. After leaving town, the highway runs through farm lands in rural Ogemaw and Iosco counties. The highway curves southeast into Tawas City. The eastern end of M-55 is at an intersection with US 23 along the shores of the Tawas Bay of Lake Huron.\n\nM-55 had its beginning by July 1, 1919 when it was designated from Cadillac to Merritt. In 1926, M-55 was extended eastward to Houghton Lake over a section of the former M-14 that was not used for the then-new US 27. At the same time, another segment of the highway was designated between M-76 at West Branch and US 23 at Whittemore. The next year, M-55 was routed along sections of US 27 and M-76 between the two communities. A western extension was added from Cadillac to US 31 near Manistee in 1932 while the eastern end was shifted from Whittemore to Tawas City when US 23 was rerouted through the area.\n\nSegments of M-55 have been relocated in the years since the basic routing was completed in the early 1930s. A more direct route from West Branch eastward was created in 1938. Prior to the construction of present-day Hemlock Road through Tawas City, M-55 entered Tawas City via present-day Plank Road, Second Street, Fifth Avenue, and Mathews Street, ending at the present-day intersection of US 23 and Mathews Street. In 1949, US 27 was moved to run to the west of Houghton and Higgins lakes. M-55 was shifted to run concurrently southward along the former M-169 which was replaced by US 27. At the intersection with the former US 27, M-55 was routed east, and the former route of M-55 was designated as a new M-169. In 1950, this M-169 was redesignated Business M-55 (Bus. M-55). M-55 was rerouted off US 27 when the US 27 freeway was completed in the area. In rerouting M-55, it was shifted back to its former routing through Houghton Lake Heights, replacing Bus. M-55 in late 1961.\n\nThe last gravel segments were paved in Iosco County between late 1958 and early 1960. Another segment east of Cadillac to M-66 south of Lake City was realigned in 1973. At the same time, M-55 was co-signed with a portion of the newly opened stretch of I-75 between M-157 and West Branch. The last routing change was made in November 2000 when the southern segment of the Cadillac bypass was opened. M-55 was moved out of downtown Cadillac and along the freeway and M-115. US 131 joined M-55 on the bypass the next October when the northern half of the bypass was completed in 2001.\n\nBusiness M-55 (Bus. M-55) was a business loop designated for just over a decade in Houghton Lake Heights. Bus. M-55 ran for along Houghton Lake Drive between US 27 and Federal Drive next to the Houghton Lake. M-55 was shifted off the road when several highways in the Houghton Lake area were rerouted. US 27 was moved to the west side of the lakes in the area, and M-55 was moved follow US 27, replace the original M-169 in the area and replace a section of the former routing of US 27 in Houghton Lake in 1949. By early 1950, the former route of M-55 through Houghton Lake Heights was designated Bus. M-55. This business loop existed until the US 27 freeway was built in the area in late 1961. At that time, M-55 was moved back to its pre-1949 routing, replacing Bus. M-55.\n\n"}

In other words, there has not been any real or consolidated theory. Furthermore, patent and copyright cases have tended to cross-cite each other. Examples of this are cases such as \"Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers\" (the producer of the movie Ben Hur (1907 film) didn't himself infringe, but was responsible for making and commercially distributing the infringing film), \"Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.\" (a booth in a department store that sold infringing sound recordings and the store was ultimately held liable), and the so-called \"dance hall\" cases (the operator of an entertainment establishment was held liable because he had effective control of the premises \"and\" obtained a direct financial benefit derived from charging entrance fees to the public).\n\nThe Copyright Act of 1790 did not provide a formal definition of infringement, stating only that “any person or persons who shall print or publish any manuscript, without the consent and approbation of the author or proprietor thereof... shall be liable to suffer and pay to the said author or proprietor all damages occasioned by such injury.” Furthermore, the Copyright Act of 1909 simply provided that any person who “shall infringe the copyright in any work protected under the copyright laws of the United States… shall be liable” for various remedies.\n\nDespite the fact that the Copyright Act of 1909 did not explicitly establish liability for acts committed by a party different than the direct infringer, several cases decided under this Act set forth the guidelines under which a party may be deemed secondarily liable. Examples of the gradual recognition by courts of copyright liability extending to those who contribute to or vicariously profit from the infringing acts of others are \"Fishel v. Lueckel\" and \"Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers\".\n\nThere are generally two kinds of secondary liability developed by courts – vicarious liability and contributory liability. Although the line between these categories of liability is blurry, a precondition for all forms of secondary liability is the underlying act (or acts) of infringement. However, unlike contributory infringement, knowledge is not an element of vicarious liability. 907 F. Supp. 1361, **36, citing 3 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT § 12.04{A}{1}, at 12-70 (1995)\n\nSome academics have classified the active inducement adopted in \"MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.\" as a new type of secondary liability because it is based on express acts of inducement and not on a mere failure to act; furthermore, the specific intent to bring about infringing acts is another important factor in this analysis.\n\nOne of the theories widely accepted as a basis for liability in copyright infringement cases is vicarious liability.\nThe concept of vicarious liability was developed in the Second Circuit as an extension of the common law doctrine of agency – \"respondeat superior\" (the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate). Pursuant to this doctrine, courts recognized that employers should be liable for the infringing acts of their employees under traditional master-servant principles. An example of this is \"M. Witmark & Sons v. Calloway\".\n\nBeyond the master-servant context, however, courts have extended liability to those who profit from infringing activity when an enterprise has the right and ability to prevent the infringement. Under \"Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein & Co.\", “[T]he owner of a dance hall at whose place copyrighted musical compositions are played in violation of the rights of the copyright holder is liable, if the playing be for the profit of the proprietor of the dance hall. And this is so even though the orchestra be employed under a contract that would ordinarily make it an independent contractor.” By contrast, courts did not extend liability to landlords who leased premises to a direct infringer for a fixed rental and did not participate directly in organizing or soliciting the infringing activity. For example, \"Deutsch v. Arnold\", \"Fonovisa v. Cherry Auction\" (extending liability to the operator of a swap meet who repeatedly leased booth space to concessionaires selling infringing tapes).\n\nThe landmark case on vicarious liability for sales of counterfeit recordings is \"Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.\" In \"Shapiro\", the court was faced with a copyright infringement suit against the owner of a chain of department stores where a concessionaire was selling counterfeit recordings. The \"Shapiro\" court ultimately imposed liability, even though the defendant was unaware of the infringement, reasoning that the store proprietor had the power to cease the conduct of the concessionaire, and because the proprietor obtained direct financial benefit from the infringement.\n\nContributory liability or contributory infringement has been widely defined as a form of liability on the part of someone who is not directly infringing but nevertheless is making contributions to the infringing acts of others. Material contributions to the act (or enabling thereof), as well as knowledge of the act itself, are key elements of contributory liability. Additionally, in the course of performing such material contributions, the parties know that they are materially infringing copyrighted content.\n\nContributory liability is rooted in the tort theory of enterprise liability. Contributory liability holds the third party liable for the primary act based on the third party's relationship with the actual harm - either by enabling or by benefiting from it. As the court stated in \"Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.\": “one who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes, or materially contributes … may be held liable as a contributory infringer.”\n\nNot long after the passage of the 1976 Copyright Act, the scope of contributory infringement liability was tested in a case in which the copyright owners claimed that the sale of a recording device – the VCR - illegally contributed to infringement. In \"Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.\" was established a variant on contributory liability claims with respect to technologies. When Universal City Studios initially sued Sony for making and selling the Betamax, the theory was that Sony materially contributed to acts of infringement performed by users of the Betamax, and knew or had reason to know that the technology would be used for infringing purposes. The Supreme Court of the United States held that, even though material contributions and knowledge of the infringement are generally sufficient to establish secondary liability, in the case of infringing technology, contributory liability cannot be imposed unless the technology lacks substantial non-infringing uses. As the Court phrased the \"Sony\" exception with regard to new technologies: \"The sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.\"\n\nRegarding internet communications, sometimes the most promising remedy is only available from the standpoint of the internet intermediary (e.g. delete the post, take down the link). In fact, the internet is a special field for secondary liability, because the open architecture of the internet facilitates many communications and users need intermediaries in order to access and contact each other's services.\n\nThe question of whether Internet service providers (ISPs) should be held liable for the actions of network users is unresolved. As to copyright, however, ISPs remain liable, in all territories, as primary, direct infringers of copyright for the copies they make on behalf of their customers, so the issue of additional secondary liability is less significant. An ISP's direct liability arises from the ISP's own actions, not the actions of another party. The confusion arises from the fact that two parties are directly liable in the usual case of internet infringement: the ISP and the ISP's customer. In legal terms, they are joint tortfeasors. This is because they both independently commit all of the acts necessary to establish liability under the copyright laws of most jurisdictions. In situations truly involving secondary liability, the party whose secondary liability is claimed has at least not committed one element required for an infringement action. This situation is not present in the usual ISP situation, as the ISP is always in the position of making copies (without authorization of the rights owner), so it is irrelevant that someone else has infringed the same copyright earlier in time. The ISP's liability is direct, not derivative. It is based on the ISP's own actions, not on someone else's.\n\nRecent statutes in the United States (Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998) and the European Union have provided significant, though not total, immunity from primary copyright liability that, in the absence of those statutes, would exist for ISPs.\n\nThe DMCA states four safe harbors:\n(a) Transitory network communications\n(b) System caching\n(c) Information storage and\n(d) Information location tools. \nThe last three have so called “notice & take down” rules for specificity in notice of infringement, counter-notice and put-back and liability if false notice has been given.\n\nIn order to be eligible for the safe harbor provisions, it is required that the service provider has adopted and reasonably implemented a policy to terminate the accounts of repetitive infringers. In addition, ISPs must accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to protect their works.\n\nAs to trademarks, in the absence of statutory guidance, courts have extended both types of secondary liability (vicarious and contributory) to third parties, including in some circumstances ISPs. Here, too, the question whether ISPs will be held liable for the acts of their infringing customers will depend on the degree of the ISP's knowledge and involvement in the specific infringing activity.\n\nFuture treatment of secondary liability by US courts is uncertain. Some cases and commentators have argued for broadening secondary liability through cost-benefit analysis, multi-factor balancing tests, or simply basing it on technical designs or business models.\n\nThe proposed EU directive would make aiding and abetting infringement a basis for liability.\nIn light of the above, it is permissible to conclude that there is no consensus on this issue.\n\n\n"}

For his services at Bannockburn, Walter was appointed Warden of the Western Marches and was rewarded with a grant of the lands of Largs, which had been forfeited by King John Balliol. In 1316 Stewart donated those lands to Paisley Abbey. \n\nFollowing the liberation of King Robert the Bruce's wife, Elizabeth de Burgh, and daughter Marjorie, from their long captivity in England, Walter the High Steward was sent to receive them at the Anglo-Scottish Border and conduct them back to the Scottish royal court. He later married Marjorie, receiving the Barony of Bathgate in Linlithgowshire as part of his wife's dowry.\n\nDuring the absence of King Robert the Bruce in Ireland, Walter the High Steward and Sir James Douglas managed government affairs and spent much time defending the Scottish Borders. Upon the capture of Berwick-upon-Tweed from the English in 1318 he took command of the town which subsequently on 24 July 1319 was besieged by King Edward II of England. Several of the siege engines were destroyed by the Scots' garrison whereupon Walter the Steward suddenly rushed in force from the walled town to drive off the enemy. In 1322, with Douglas and Thomas Randolph, he made an attempt to surprise the English king at Byland Abbey, near Malton in Yorkshire, but Edward escaped, pursued towards York by Walter the Steward and 500 horsemen.\n\nIn about 1320/26 Walter, Steward of Scotland, granted by charter to John St. Clair, his valet, the lands of Maxton, Roxburghshire, one of the witnesses being \"Roberto de Lauwedir tunc justiciario Laudonie\" (\"Robert de Lauder, then Justiciar of Lothian\").\n\nHe married twice:\n\nHe died on 9 April 1326 at Bathgate Castle and was buried in the Abbey Church of Paisley, alongside his first wife, Marjorie Bruce, and his five High Steward ancestors. A memorial on the wall of the Abbey is inscribed as follows:\n\"In everlasting memory of the High Stewards of Scotland. Here rest their bodies where stood the high altar of this Abbey Church of Paisley\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2003602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003602", "title": "Gordita", "text": "Gordita\n\nA gordita () in Mexican cuisine is a pastry made with masa and stuffed with cheese, meat, or other fillings. It is similar to a pasty and to the Colombian and Venezuelan arepa. \"Gordita\" means \"chubby\" in Spanish. There are two main variations of this dish, one which is typically fried in a deep wok-shaped comal, consumed mostly in central and southern Mexico, and another one baked on a regular comal. The most common and representative variation of this dish is the \"\"gordita de chicharrón\"\", filled with chicharron (a spiced stew of pork rind) which is widely consumed throughout Mexico. Gorditas are often eaten as a lunch meal and accompanied by several types of sauce.\n\nA gordita is typically prepared as a thick tortilla. The dough is most commonly made of nixtamalized corn flour, as also used for tortillas, but can also be of wheat flour, particularly in northern Mexico close to the U.S border. An old variant of corn gorditas uses \"masa quebrada\" (broken dough) where the cornmeal is coarsely ground, leaving bits of broken grain. \n\nIn the deep-fried version, once the masa has been prepared, it is separated in small portions, then each one is filled with meat, and shaped like an oblong disc. The pastry is immersed in boiling oil until golden and crispy on the outside. After cooking, the gordita is allowed to stand to drain excess oil, then a small slit is cut into one side to allow vapor and excessive heat to release, and lime juice and salsa are poured inside, which gives the gordita its characteristic flavor. In some regions of Mexico, the slit is also used to stuff additional ingredients, mostly dressings such as fresh cheese, nopal salad, tomatoes, guacamole, potatoes, beans or \"rajas\" (sautéed strips of chile). By tradition, gorditas are filled with chicharron, but there are local variations which substitute it by chicken stew, shredded beef, carne al pastor, eggs with chorizo sausage, carnitas or picadillo. \n\nThe baked version is prepared almost identically to the preparation of a common tortilla, except it is thicker. When the masa is prepared, chicharrón is mixed directly in the dough, instead of being added later. Shaped like a flat circle, then it is placed in a comal until cooked, in most cases not adding additional oil. When slit and filled, this gordita looks like a sandwich made with tortillas instead of bread. This variation is known as \"Gordita de migas\".\n\nIn central Mexico, gorditas commonly range from being relatively small, but bulky (about the size of a child's fist), to about the diameter of a \"regular\" tortilla. In northern Mexico they tend to be larger and flatter.\n\nIn most cases gorditas are shallow-fried with vegetable oil in a deep comal, but they can also be deep-fried, making the outside crisper.\n\nIn Durango and other states of Northern Mexico, gorditas are commonly made from wheat flour and look like small pita breads. The dough (masa) is identical to that of a wheat flour tortilla. It is cooked on a comal with a hot piece of metal placed on top that resembles a clothes iron. The gordita fills with steam, and a small slit is cut into one side where it can be filled with guisados.\n\n\nThe fast food restaurant chain Taco Bell offers a wheat flour gordita that has limited similarity to gorditas as served in Mexico and is more akin to a pita bread taco.\n\nIn eastern and central Mexico \"gorditas de nata\" (cream gorditas) are consumed often as a breakfast dish or snack. It is a sweet cake similar to a tiny but extremely thick pancake made with milk cream or clotted cream, called \"nata\" in Mexico, cinnamon, sugar, and white wheat flour. They are named \"gordita\" too, due to their appearance, similar to the original fried gordita, but their taste is sweet, not salty. Besides their appearance, this snack is not related to the original one. The same flour preparation used to prepare gorditas de nata is also used to cook a flat cookie variation, which by extension it is also called \"gordita\", but in contrast, it is thin and crispy, not thick. To differentiate them, these flat cookies are called \"sugar gorditas\" instead.\n\n"}

The modern German terms for the occupation of carpenter are Zimmerer, Tischler, or Schreiner, but Zimmermann is still used.\n\n\"Zimmer\" in German means room or archaically a chamber within a structure. The German \"man\" or \"mann\" (in English the extra \"n\" is ignored) is man or worker. The combinaton of the two means \"a worker of wood\", \"room man\" or room worker.\n\nZimmermann, as a surname is often confused with Zimmerman. The loss or addition of the double \"n\" may imply many things. This may include linguistic, racial, ethnic, religious or other cultural variations.\n\nMany German names were often Anglicized or simplified by immigration officials upon entry into the United States. With Zimmermann the double 'n' Zimmermann was often seen as redundant in countries where English was spoken. As a part of routine, German names were often Anglicized or simplified later by immigrants to better fit in. Zimmerman became Carpenter for example. Sometimes this was done by immigration officials upon entry into the United States when the immigrant did not know how to spell their name and that variant became the legal name.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2003633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003633", "title": "Mindbender (Galaxyland)", "text": "Mindbender (Galaxyland)\n\nThe Mindbender is an Anton Schwarzkopf looping roller coaster opened in 1985 at Galaxyland Amusement Park, a theme park located in West Edmonton Mall, in Alberta, Canada. At in height, it is the tallest indoor roller coaster in the world. The Mindbender had an accident in 1986 that killed 3 people and injured 20.\n\nMindbender was designed by Germany's Werner Stengel and built by Anton Schwarzkopf. It was inspired by this team's previous design, Dreier Looping, a portable coaster that travelled the German funfair circuit, before being sold to a succession of amusement parks in Malaysia, Great Britain, and most recently, Mexico. Mindbender is a pseudo mirror-image of Dreier Looping, and is slightly taller, with additional helices at the end of the ride. Mindbender features shorter trains, with three pilot cars, whereas Dreier Looping usually ran with five trailer cars and one pilot car, occasionally rising to seven-car trains at busy funfairs.\n\nThe ride's layout features many twisting drops, three vertical loops and a double upward helix finale. The ride twists underneath, in between and around its supports. It also goes underneath the former UFO Maze attraction, which has been removed to make way for another roller coaster; Gerstlauer's Galaxy Orbiter, during the helix.\n\nOften in high season, the last car on one of the trains is reversed, allowing guests to ride the roller coaster without being able to see where they are going.\n\nAfter boarding the Mindbender, riders put on their seatbelt and lap restraints. Also, the ride operator lowers large shoulder restraints over the riders. All of the restraints keep the riders firmly secured in the seat.\n\nAfter ascending the curving wheel driven lift hill, the train descends a sharp, twisting left-hand drop (sometimes referred to as a Traver drop) that climbs back up to the first of four stacked block brakes. The train negotiates a second left-hand drop that is immediately followed by the first two vertical loops. Then the train repeats the aforementioned process happens yet again: it goes up to the third block brake, then does another twisting drop and ascent before hitting the fourth block brake. After the fourth block brake, the track drops to the left and back down to ground level, and hits the third vertical loop.\n\nFollowing the third loop, the coaster train does another cycle under the stacked block brakes, then shoots along a two-layered upward helix, before running behind the Galaxy Quest 7D theater to hit the final brake run and the exit/entry area.\n\nThe ride length from the initial drop should normally range from one minute five seconds to one minute twenty-five seconds. Circuits times as little as 59 seconds are possible through extensive waxing of the track, and reduction in tension on the bogey wheels. This increase in speed is not permitted during public rides, as the forces on the riders becomes severe. During testing of the renovated trains in 1987, the maximum g-force of a normal run was measured on equipment bolted into the train at 5.5 G's, which occurs in the second loop.\n\nOn the evening of 14 June 1986, the fourth car of a train traveling midway along the course derailed before encountering the third and final loop. Its wheels had become detached from both the track and car itself, causing it to sway back and forth across the tracks. The car became damaged, and the lap bar restraints unlocked and released, throwing all four of its passengers to the concrete floor below. The train continued to move along the track and into the final loop, but friction from the car's derailment slowed the train and prevented it from clearing the loop. As it rolled backward down the loop, the detached car crashed into a concrete pillar about midway down, stopping the train abruptly. Three of the four passengers thrown from the ride died, while the fourth was left critically injured with permanent, life-altering effects. The remaining passengers were safely evacuated and treated at a nearby hospital with minor injuries. An investigation later determined that four cap screws holding the wheel assembly together failed, which were likely the result of design flaws and unsatisfactory maintenance routines.\n\nWhen Mindbender reopened in January 1987, the trains were redesigned. The existing four-car trains were converted to three-car trains (reducing seating capacity from 16 to 12), and anti-roll back features were installed. Each train previously consisted of two wheel assemblies per car, however after this accident, two further wheel assemblies were added to each car. The lap bar restraint was retained, but seat belts and shoulder headrests were added.\n\n\n"}

It was devoted to health care, focusing on the human body, physical fitness, medicine and nutrition. Attractions included Body Wars and Cranium Command. It is located inside a golden colored dome between and the Universe of Energy. It opened on October 19, 1989, and closed on January 1, 2007. From 2007 to 2018, the Pavilion acted as EPCOT's Festival Center, before becoming a construction site in March 2019 in preparation for the upcoming Play! pavilion to replace it.\n\nThe original attractions within the building have been closed and partially removed. In February 2019, it was announced that a new Play! pavilion would be built in the domed show building formerly occupied by Wonders of Life, and is scheduled to open in time for Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary in 2021.\n\nThe idea of a pavilion devoted to health and fitness dates back to the original concept of the EPCOT Center theme park, but no corporate sponsor could be found to cover the costs. It was not until MetLife signed on that the pavilion was finally constructed, and it featured two main attractions: Cranium Command and Body Wars, the first thrill ride located in EPCOT. Also featured was a theater (home to \"The Making of Me\"), restaurant and interactive attractions that evolved around the idea of health and wellness. MetLife ended its sponsorship in 2001, which led to the slow decline of the pavilion. On January 4, 2004, Disney made the decision to make it seasonal operation only. It reopened when the park was projected to hit near capacity during the high spring months and Christmas season. Its most recent operational phase was November 26, 2006, through January 1, 2007. In 2007, the pavilion closed permanently, with no official reason given. While it is not operational to the public, it is still commonly used for private and corporate events.\n\nIn 2007, temporary walls were placed around the existing attractions when Epcot hosted the Food and Wine festival in the pavilion. The \"Body Wars\" sign was removed in 2008, replaced by a temporary Garden Town sign while the imprints from the original marquee were painted over. By 2009, significant portions of the Body Wars attraction had been removed. The \"Celebrate the Joy of Life\" sign was removed following in 2009, while most of the exhibits left were removed. The pavilion also received a paint job inside using mute colors such as white and light green.\n\nThe pavilion then operated seasonally as the center for the Epcot International Flower and Garden Festival and the Epcot International Food & Wine Festival as the Festival Center. For those events, it hosted seminars, videos, presentations, and more. It was used as a central merchandise location during the two festivals as well. All attractions are shut down and their signs have been removed. As of November 2014, the \"Body Wars\" ride simulators have been dismantled. The queue still exists, but most of the props and other electronics have been removed. As of 2017, \"Cranium Command\" has had its queue and pre-show partially dismantled, but the theater - including the animatronics, lighting, seats, and staging area - remains intact. The theater that was used for \"The Making of Me\" is still used for various movies and presentations during the event.\n\nOn September 11, 2012, Walt Disney Imagineering filed a notice of commencement with the Orange County Comptroller’s office indicating the intentions for a \"selective demolition\" to take place at the pavilion. In February 2019, it was announced that a new interactive pavilion would be built in the dome formerly occupied by Wonders of Life. The pavilion is scheduled to open in time for Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2003647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003647", "title": "The Seas with Nemo &amp; Friends", "text": "The Seas with Nemo &amp; Friends\n\nThe Seas with Nemo & Friends (formerly The Living Seas) is an aquarium and attached dark ride attraction located on the western side of Future World at Epcot, a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. The pavilion is themed as an underwater exploration base called SeaBase Alpha, with several exhibits devoted to oceanic study. The pavilion opened in 1986, but had been planned as part of the park since its opening in 1982.\n\nThe Seas with Nemo & Friends is located in Future World West, which is planned to be re-designated World Nature.\n\nThe Living Seas opened to the public on January 15, 1986. It housed the largest saltwater tank in the world at its completion, holding of water, but was surpassed in 2005 with the opening of the Georgia Aquarium. The concept of the building was to take visitors under the ocean to \"Sea Base Alpha\". Guests viewed a short movie about the formation of the oceans entitled The Sea, which was followed by an elevator ride to the ocean floor aboard a \"Hydrolator\" (in reality, guests rode a stationary hydraulic elevator while moving walls, sound effects and a vibrating floor gave the effect of traveling a long distance downward ). Guests then boarded a Seacab on the Caribbean Coral Reef Ride, and rode through the middle of the tank. They then disembarked into the main exhibit area where they could interact with various multimedia displays. Once finished, guests leaving the pavilion would then board another Hydrolator to the surface (which, similar to the first set of elevators, simulated upward motion).\n\nThe Living Seas was sponsored by United Technologies from its opening until 1998. After the departure of United Technologies as sponsor of The Living Seas, significant changes were made to the pavilion. All sponsorship references were removed from the pavilion. Preshow theatre #2 was removed and a corridor was built through its space, allowing for guests to bypass the preshow if they wished to go directly to the Hydrolators.\n\nOn October 21, 2001, as a result of declining patronage following the September 11 attacks, the Seacabs closed down and were walled off. The queue of the Seacab ride was left intact and the Seacabs were still visible to guests through the ocean tank windows. Reasons for their closure are not entirely known. After they closed, guests leaving the Hydrolators walked along the former wheelchair bypass corridor to Sea Base Alpha. Now, guests had the option of viewing the preshow or going directly to the Hydrolators and simply walking to Sea Base Alpha.\n\nIn December 2003, Disney began to re-theme The Living Seas into a new pavilion based on the recently released Pixar film \"Finding Nemo\". The majority of the transformation began with exterior elements, but in January 2004, the interior began to change as well. On November 16, 2004, Turtle Talk with Crush opened in what was once Module 1C, or the Earth Systems exhibit. The show's unexpected success overwhelmed the pavilion, causing the development of plans to move Turtle Talk with Crush to a larger area in the pavilion.\n\nTurtle Talk with Crush was only the beginning of changes to The Living Seas. On August 21, 2005, The Living Seas closed for its transformation into The Seas with Nemo & Friends. Parts of the pavilion reopened in late November 2005. Outside the pavilion, the facade and mural were changed and depictions of sea life seen in \"Finding Nemo\" were added. The exit Hydrolators had been removed, and were replaced with glass doors that served as an exit and temporary entrance. Sea Base Alpha had been re-themed to \"Finding Nemo\" and the entire original preshow area was in the process of being rebuilt. Decor and signage was replaced and scientific displays were replaced by ones themed to \"Finding Nemo\". Turtle Talk with Crush remained as popular as it was before the transformation.\n\nThroughout 2006, construction walls hid the preshow area which was undergoing reconstruction. With the former Sea Base Alpha open, work progressed on the new queue areas and the Seacabs were being rebuilt as a new \"Clamobile\" attraction. The remaining Living Seas preshow theater, entrance Hydrolators, holding areas, and Seacabs queue were all completely removed and replaced by a new themed queue area. Hydrolator Three and Theater 1 were replaced by a number of new dark ride sets. The former Seacabs ride was lengthened by through the space formerly used by the preshow theatre, but the final section still took place inside the tank. A new projection technology was added to the tank and the new show scenes. The existing Seacabs were given a clamshell shape and renamed \"Clamobiles\". Three Audio-Animatronic seagulls were also added to the entrance. They periodically flap their wings and say \"Mine! Mine! Mine!\", just like the seagulls do in \"Finding Nemo\".\n\nOn October 10, 2006, the construction walls in front of the entrance to The Living Seas, now The Seas with Nemo & Friends, were removed. The temporary entrance was removed from the exit. Turtle Talk With Crush was removed from Module 1C, and relocated to the second preshow theater, which had been unused since 1999 when it had been broken up by the bypass corridor following United Technologies' discontinuation of sponsorship. Module 1A was turned into a pre-show space for the expanded Turtle Talk With Crush, with its exhibits moving to 1C, while a new queue line corridor was built from the module into the existing theater space using a backstage fire exit. The Seas with Nemo & Friends was rededicated on January 24, 2007.\n\nIt was the first Epcot Pavilion to be based on a Disney animated movie property and only the second Epcot attraction to do so (\"The Lion King\"-based \"\" at The Land Pavilion was the first, opening in 1995 replacing \"Symbiosis\").\n\nIn late 2019, new directory signage was installed in Seabase Alpha, restoring the former Living Seas logo. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pavilion has a backstage VIP room that is used for private events, such as weddings and conventions.

It is located near Victoria Park Avenue and Danforth Avenue. It mainly consists of high-rise apartment complexes, built originally to take advantage of the opening of the adjacent Victoria Park subway station, which connects to the central quadrangle via a partially covered walkway.\n\nCrescent Town was founded in 1887 when Walter Massey, the son of Hart Massey, Canada's first major industrialist, purchased a 240-acre (1 km²) country property centered on Dawes Road and Victoria Park Avenue. The Massey farm was named Dentonia after Mrs. Massey's family whose surname was Denton. The Massey farm sold fresh eggs and poultry as well as fresh trout which was caught in the many streams and rivulets that criss-crossed the farm. The Massey farm was also the home of the City Dairy Company which produced the first pasteurized milk in Canada.\n\nIn 1933, Susan Massey generously gave 40 acres (160,000 m²) of the Dentonia farm to Crescent School where her grandsons were educated. Crescent School operated at Dentonia until 1969 when this property was sold to the developers who built the present day Crescent Town neighbourhood.\n\nHollywood actor Kiefer Sutherland of the television series \"24\" was a Crescent Town resident. He spent part of his childhood in Crescent Town and attended the Crescent Town Elementary School, where he first met former Mayor of Toronto, David Miller.\n\nCrescent Town is considered by some as an interesting experiment in community planning in that all of its pedestrian walkways are located above the street level. It is a multicultural neighbourhood, whose population includes extensive numbers of Bangladeshi, Indian, Jamaican, Pakistani and Tamil Canadians. There are many Bangladeshi-owned businesses near the neighbourhood (Victoria Park-Danforth). Some of the buildings are condominiums (Massey Square), while others are rental apartments (Crescent Place). Toronto council classified Oakridge under Taylor-Massey as a neighborhood improvement area in 2014\n"}

The pavilion is dedicated to human interaction with the Earth, focusing on agriculture and travel. It opened on October 1, 1982, as part of the Phase I features for the grand opening of what was then known as EPCOT Center. \"The Land\" dedicated to human interaction with the land itself. It explores how humans can both use the land for their benefit, and how they can also destroy it. Future Technology in better preserving the land is also explored in the pavilion, along with a focus on the celebration of the land itself.\n\nThe 24 hectare (2.5 million square foot) facility features four attractions; Soarin' Around the World, Living with the Land, \"Awesome Planet\", and Behind the Seeds Tour.\n\nThe Land is located in Future World West, which is planned to be re-designated World Nature.\n\nWhile \"The Land\" pavilion has existed since 1982, it has gone through three significant phases. The pavilion's first incarnation involved a ten-year sponsorship under Kraft Foods Inc. from 1982–1992. Kraft played a vital role in co-financing the everyday functions of the attractions, restaurants, and shops inside the pavilion. The pavilion's interior and exterior design featured earth tone colors and exotic plant life.\n\nIn 1993, plans were made to update and modernize the overall tone of EPCOT Center, including a major refurbishment of \"The Land\" pavilion. Kraft withdrew its sponsorship on September 26, 1993, with Nestlé taking its place. Co-financed by Nestlé and the Walt Disney World Resort, a gradual refurbishment of the pavilion began on September 27, 1993.\n\nThe pavilion itself was cosmetically freshened. While some of the original design elements remained, the addition of more vibrant colors and fabrics to the various restaurants and shops gave the pavilion a more modern and refreshed look. The names of certain shops, restaurants, and attractions also changed during this time. The pavilion's main attraction, Listen to the Land, which took guests on connected boats through various exhibits within the pavilion, reopened mostly unchanged as Living with the Land on December 10, 1993.\n\nThe Kitchen Kabaret Revue, another of the pavilion's original attractions featuring an Audio-Animatronics presentation about nutrition, closed on January 3, 1994. It was replaced with a new show titled Food Rocks, which featured some of the elements from the original show with an updated presentation intended to be more modern and appealing to younger audiences.\n\nSymbiosis, the last of \"The Land\"'s three original attractions, was closed on January 1, 1995. This attraction, which was a cinematic presentation that discussed both the positive and negative aspects of human relationship with the land, eventually reopened as , a new film featuring characters from The Lion King. Like the Food Rocks show, this new attraction recycled some of the elements of its predecessor, and was intended to be another refreshed and modernized feature of \"The Land\" that would better appeal to younger audiences.\n\nIn 2003, Nestlé renewed its sponsorship of \"The Land\"; however, it was under agreement that Nestlé would oversee its own refurbishment to both the interior and exterior of the conservatory-style pavilion. Between 2004 and 2005, the pavilion underwent its second major refurbishment. It received a new color scheme featuring a vibrant selection of white, yellow, and green. New foliage was added to complement the existing greenery. The walkways and stroller parking to the pavilion's entrance were redefined and widened. All of the carpeting in the pavilion was replaced, and the main food court was completely redesigned. The pavilion's signage was updated, incorporating the new color scheme, new typography, and a modernized logotype. The pavilion's original dedication plaque remained unchanged.\n\nThe most significant change to \"The Land\" during its 2004–2005 refurbishment was the closure and entire demolition of Food Rocks, which initially occurred on January 3, 2004. Taking its place would be Soarin', a major attraction that was originally designed and built for Disney California Adventure Park. Simulating the experience of hang gliding over various landscapes, Soarin's massive movie screens and ride mechanics required the construction of a large physical addition to the pavilion itself.\n\n\"The Land\" officially reopened on May 5, 2005, which coincided with the start of Disney's Happiest Celebration on Earth Campaign. \nWhile \"The Land\" as a pavilion has somewhat changed, its purpose has not, and it remains a positive and serious experience featuring elements from all three of its phases, allowing today's guests to experience all that \"The Land\" has to offer.\n\nOn February 13, 2009, Nestlé pulled out of sponsorship, leaving \"The Land\" without a sponsor. \n\n\"Living with the Land\" was closed for a vehicle update from August 2, 2009, to October 2, 2009. This update increased passenger capacity from 36 to 40 guests per vehicle. Newer, more wheelchair-friendly vehicles were also a new addition.\n\nOn July 29, 2011, Chiquita signed on as the new sponsor for the ride Living with the Land. However, it is not mentioned in-ride by the narrator (Mike Brassell) nor does it have a VIP lounge in The Land building itself.\n\nIn addition to being an entertainment venue, \"The Land\" is also a demonstration, production, and research facility. 43,000 ft² (0.4 hectares) of the pavilion are dedicated to experimental horticulture techniques in hydroponics, irrigation methods, and integrated pest management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

For each URL entered, the server adds a new alias in its hashed database and returns a short URL. According to the website, the shortened URLs will never expire.\n\nTinyURL offers an API which allows applications to automatically create short URLs. This is done by simply reading the result returned from codice_1.\n\nShort URL aliases are seen as useful because they are easier to write down, remember or distribute. They also fit in text boxes with a limited number of characters allowed. Some examples of limited text boxes are IRC channel topics, email signatures, microblogs, certain printed newspapers (such as \".net\" magazine or even \"Nature\"), and email clients that impose line breaks on messages at a certain length.\n\nStarting in 2008, TinyURL allowed users to create custom, more meaningful aliases.

{"id": "2003681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003681", "title": "Guy Mannering", "text": "Guy Mannering\n\nGuy Mannering; or, The Astrologer is a novel by Sir Walter Scott, published anonymously in 1815. According to an introduction that Scott wrote in 1829, he had originally intended to write a story of the supernatural, but changed his mind soon after starting. The book was a huge success, the first edition selling out on the first day of publication.\n\nScott began the composition of \"Guy Mannering\" in the last days of 1814, immediately after completing his last long narrative poem \"The Lord of the Isles\". Writing with remarkable speed, he finished it by mid-February 1815.\n\n\"Guy Mannering\" appeared in three volumes in Edinburgh and London on 24 February 1815. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827, publication was anonymous. This first edition of 2,000 copies was followed by a further 5,000 copies in March and May, the second and third editions. There is no clear evidence for authorial involvement in these, or in any of the novel's subsequent appearances except for the 18mo \"Novels and Tales\" (1823) and the \"Magnum\" edition. Some of the small changes to the text in 1823 are attributable to Scott, but that edition was a textual dead end. At the beginning of 1828 he provided the novel with an introduction and notes, and revised the text, for the Magnum edition in which it appeared as Volumes 3 and 4 in August and September 1829. The standard modern edition, by P. D. Garside, was published as Volume 2 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 1999: this is based on the first edition; the Magnum material appears in Volume 25a.\n\n\"Guy Mannering\" is set in the 1760s to 1780s, mostly in the Galloway area of southwest Scotland, but with episodes in Cumberland, Holland, and India. It tells the story of Henry \"Harry\" Bertram, the son of the Laird of Ellangowan, who is kidnapped at the age of five by smugglers after witnessing the murder of a customs officer. It follows the fortunes and adventures of Harry and his family in subsequent years, and the struggle over the inheritance of Ellangowan. The novel also depicts the lawlessness that existed at the time, when smugglers operated along the coast and thieves frequented the country roads.\n\nGuy Mannering, after leaving Oxford, is travelling alone in southwestern Scotland, on the coast of the Solway Firth. After losing his way at nightfall, he is directed to Ellangowan, the home of Mr Godfrey Bertram. The friendly but incompetent Bertram welcomes him, although his wife is in labour with their first child. As they await news, Mannering meets Dominie Sampson, a learned but socially inept tutor, and Meg Merrilies, a wild-looking, strident Gypsy woman, who has come to tell the child's fortune. The young student, however, offers to do this from the stars, and predicts that three periods of the boy's life will be very hazardous. Not wishing to concern the parents, he leaves his predictions to be opened when the child is five years old. Mannering also meets smuggler Dirk Hatteraick, who captains vessels active off the wild coast by Ellangowan.\n\nHowever, before his fifth birthday is over, little Harry Bertram disappears while in the care of an excise-man, Kennedy, who is murdered by smugglers. No trace can be found of the child, though Kennedy's body is found at the foot of a cliff. In her distress, his mother goes into labour once again, and after giving birth to a daughter, she dies.\n\nSeventeen years elapse, and Mannering, now a Colonel, returns from India and visits Scotland once again. He arrives at Ellangowan in time to be present at the death of the now destitute Godfrey Bertram. The possessions and home of Bertram and his daughter Lucy are being sold. Mannering attempts to buy the estate, but is called back to England to attend to his own daughter who is reported to have a lover, so misses the sale. The Ellangowan estate is purchased at a reduced rate by the conniving Glossin, whose unscrupulous dealings have been one of the causes of the Bertrams' downfall. The estate is sold on the condition that if the male heir is found, the estate will return to the Bertrams.\n\nMannering's daughter Julia has in fact been entertaining the affections of Vanbeest Brown, a young cavalry officer from her father's regiment, though she does not admit this to her father. Brown is unsure of his parentage, having been raised in Holland, and told that though born in Scotland, he was rescued at a young age from smugglers. Colonel Mannering in fact believes that he killed Brown in a duel in India, a fact which weighs heavily on his conscience. (Out of concern that Mannering will disapprove of Brown's low status, Mannering's wife had led him to believe that Brown's affectionate visits were to her, not her daughter. Mannering's wife dies before the truth of the matter is explained.)\n\nMannering brings his daughter with him to Scotland, and rents a house called Woodbourne, not far from Ellangowan. He invites Lucy Bertram to be a companion for his daughter, and Dominie Sampson to be his librarian.\n\nBrown follows Julia Mannering to Scotland, taking a roundabout route to explore some of the wilder parts of his birth country. He dines at an inn called Mump's Hall, where he meets a jolly farmer, Dandie Dinmont. Here he also meets Meg Merrilies, who seems to recognise him. The proprietress of Mump's Hall sends thugs to burgle Dinmont on the road, and Brown arrives in time to help fend them off. In gratitude Dinmont invites Brown to stay at his farm with his large family (and their many terriers, all called Mustard or Pepper) for some days. While hunting with his new friend, Brown meets a gamekeeper called Gabriel, who also seems to recognise him.\n\nMeanwhile, at Woodbourne, a group of excise-men seek protection from a gang of smugglers, who outnumber them. Under the superior tactics of Mannering, the smugglers are driven off, and several of their ringleaders killed or mortally wounded.\n\nProceeding on his wintry journey, Brown becomes lost; following a light, he comes to a ruined hut in a ruined hamlet of Dernclough, in which Meg Merillies is tending a dying man (one of the smugglers), singing incantations to free the soul from the body. She hides Brown, saying the dead man's accomplices will kill him. Brown watches from a cramped hiding place under some straw as the thugs empty his portmanteau and dispose of all his papers, weapons and money. In the morning, Meg shows him the road and gives him her well-ladened purse, exacting at the same time a promise that he will come to her immediately whenever she calls him to do so. He continues on his way.\n\nWriting to a friend, Julia makes great fun of the Dominie's peculiarities, and mentions Lucy's discouragement of her suitor, young Hazlewood, because she has no fortune and he is wealthy. Julia then describes with horror the sudden appearance of Brown, who intercepts them on a path through the woods. Hazelwood, nervous from the smugglers' attack, threatens Brown, who tries to disarm him; in the struggle Hazelwood is shot in the shoulder. Brown is now a wanted man and on the run, although Hazelwood acknowledges that the shooting was accidental.\n\nThe attorney Glossin, now a justice of the peace, is indefatigable in endeavouring to trace Hazelwood's attacker, in the hope of ingratiating himself to the Hazelwood family. He hears with pleasure that the gaoler McGuffog has a man in custody. However, the man is not Brown but Dirk Hatteraick, a Dutch smuggler, known well to Glossin, who has in the past been his accomplice. Hatteraick warns Glossin that Harry Bertram has been seen in Scotland. Glossin engineers Hatteraick's escape from custody, and meets him in a hidden smuggler's cave, close to where Hatteraick caused the death of Kennedy. It is revealed that Glossin was involved with the smugglers who committed the murder, and gave them the child to dispose of. Hatteraick explains that the child was adopted and educated in Holland, and that he has recently been seen by an ex-smuggler, Gabriel, in the local hills. He also reveals that it was Harry Bertram/Brown who injured Hazelwood. Glossin is determined to kill the young heir.\n\nAn elderly aunt of Lucy Bertram's dies in Edinburgh, generating hope that her fortune may have been left to Lucy. Mannering, accompanied by the Dominie, travels to Edinburgh to place the matter in the advocate Mr Pleydell's hands. He strikes up a lively friendship with Pleydell, but they find that the old lady has left her estate to the heir of Ellangowan, when he is found. They learn from a serving-maid that Meg Merrilies planted the idea that Harry Bertram is alive in the old lady's head. Dandie Dinmont is also there, and his robust honesty earns Mannering's respect, despite the class divide.\n\nHarry retreats to Cumberland, and writes to his regiment for replacement papers. He also manages to correspond with Julia, whose letter draws him back to Scotland. He is landed at Ellangowan, and he explores the ruined castle beside the modern estate, finding it strangely familiar. There he encounters Glossin, who promptly has him arrested for shooting Hazlewood, and lodges him in the dismal bridewell (small prison) adjoining the custom-house at Portanferry. Here he is visited, unexpectedly, by Dinmont, who has heard from Gabriel of his being in danger. Dinmont manages to convince McGuffog to allow him to stay the night in Harry's cell. (Harry at this stage still believes himself to be Vanbeest Brown.)\n\nMeanwhile, the Colonel has returned from Edinburgh. Meg Merrilies intercepts the Dominie on a ramble, and sends an urgent note by him to Mannering. She also stops young Hazlewood, and tells him to cause the soldiers who have been withdrawn from Portanferry to be sent back there instantly. Glossin has \"warned\" Hazelwood's father of an attack on his estate, in order that Portanferry is left unguarded, so that Glossin's men can attack and kill Harry Bertram. During the night the custom-house is fired by a gang of ruffians; strangely, however, Bertram and Dinmont are assisted to escape, and led to a carriage. It later emerges that Gypsy relatives of Meg and Gabriel have infiltrated the party.\n\nOn the same evening Counsellor Pleydell arrives to visit his new friend Mannering, and Mannering admits that he has sent a carriage to Portanferry on the strength of a note from the old Gypsy woman. They wait impatiently for the arrival of the carriage, unsure whom it will carry. Just as they have given up, the carriage arrives. Mannering is shocked to see Brown, alive; Julia, too, is shocked by her lover's arrival; Lucy is terrified to see the ruffian who injured her lover, Hazelwood, on the road; Sampson thinks he has seen the ghost of Old Bertram. Once things have been explained, Harry Bertram, now acknowledged as the heir of Ellangowan, is tearfully welcomed. Sampson hugs his \"little Harry\" with delight, and Mannering, his conscience cleared, welcomes the young man. Lucy embraces her long-lost brother, and Julia confesses her love to her father.\nHowever, a legal right to Ellangowan has not been established, and Mannering and Pleydell must organise bail. Meanwhile, Bertram and the two young ladies are walking when Meg Merrilies meets them and demands that Harry come with her. He agrees, and Meg is pleased that Dinmont can accompany him as protector. The women then meet Hazelwood, and send him to follow on horseback. Meg leads the way to the Dernclough hut and arms them, then takes them to the smugglers' cave. Here the three men overcome Hatteraick, but Meg is mortally wounded in the struggle. Hatteraick is imprisoned, and crowds gather at Dernclough, where Meg is dying. They welcome the heir of Ellangowan with delight. Meg's dying revelations, along with testimony from Gabriel, furnish sufficient evidence to arrest Glossin also.\n\nIn prison, Glossin bribes McGuffog to obtain access to the smuggler's cell to concoct a defence. In fury, Hatteraick kills Glossin, then hangs himself.\n\nHaving recovered the property of his ancestors, Harry Bertram is able to discharge all his father's debts. With the help of Julia's dowry, he builds a new mansion, which includes a snug chamber called \"Mr Sampson's apartment,\" and a separate bungalow for Colonel Mannering. Harry's late aunt's estate has also reverted to him, but he resigns it to his sister on her marriage to Hazelwood.\n\n\"Principal characters in bold\"\n\nVolume One\n\nCh. 1: Guy loses his way while visiting Dumfriesshire and is conducted to Ellangowan by a local boy.\n\nCh. 2: He meets the decayed laird of Ellangowan and his companion Dominie Sampson, a failed minister.\n\nCh. 3: The gipsy Meg Merrilees arrives for birth of Ellangowan's heir, and Guy contemplates the stars prior to drawing up a scheme of nativity for the infant (Harry Bertram), though without himself believing in astrology.\n\nCh. 4: Guy is surprised that the new scheme is identical with one he had prepared for his wife before their marriage.

Guy will have a bungalow close to a large and splendid new house to be built at Ellangowan.\n\nThe title character, Guy Mannering, is a relatively minor character in the story, a friend of the family who uses his knowledge of astrology to predict Henry's future on the day of his birth.\n\nThe old gypsy woman Meg Merrilies, is evicted from the Bertram lands early in the novel. In spite of this she remains loyal to the Bertram family, and much of the plot is dependent on her actions. She was based on an 18th-century gypsy named Jean Gordon.\nDandie Dinmont is a rough but friendly farmer from the Liddesdale hills, who owns a number of terriers—the Dandie Dinmont Terrier is named after him. An upland sheep-raiser of Scott's acquaintance named Willie Elliot, of Millburnholm, was probably the model for this character.\n\nDominie Sampson, according to Nuttall, was \"a poor, modest, humble scholar, who had won his way through the classics, but fallen to the leeward in the voyage of life\". \"Dominie\" is the Lowland Scots term for a school master.\n\nTib Mumps was the disreputable landlady of the inn where an important meeting takes place between Meg Merrilies and Bertram. The inn was later revealed by Scott to be based upon Mumps Hall in Gilsland.\n\nAlthough \"Guy Mannering\" sold briskly the critical reception was mixed. Most of the reviews were broadly favourable, but they generally had more or less substantial reservations. Positive features mentioned by several reviewers included the energetic and virtuoso writing, the vivid descriptions, the acute knowledge of human nature, and the near-sublime Meg Merrilies with the contrasting Dandie Dinmont. John Wilson Croker in \"The Quarterly Review\" was alone in thinking that Meg was given undue importance. There were objections to the inappropriate introduction of astrology, the weak plot, the insipid young ladies and the exaggerated Dominie Sampson (though he was generally appreciated), and the unintelligible Scots speeches.\n\nDaniel Terry, an English playwright and friend of Scott, wrote an adaptation of the work for the stage for which Henry Bishop provided the music. The musical play was premiered at the Covent Garden Theatre in London on 12 March 1816, with Sarah Egerton in the role of Meg Merrilies.\n\n"}

She was \"Playboy\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Playmate of the Month for March 1987.\n\nBorn in Windsor, Berkshire, and originally from Taplow, Buckinghamshire, she and her older brother Martin \"moved around a lot\" until they reached Norfolk. She had an unconventional, hippie, nomadic upbringing in the rural environs of Norfolk, as well as different parts of the Midlands and the Southeast. By her own account, her family \"thought we were getting a new-built home, but it wasn't ready, and my mother, being as practical as ever, said: 'Well, we are homeless, so we are travellers until we are housed'. I remember trees, bushes and grass and a toilet in a shed. There was this enormous chrome caravan with those sort of lacy doily things in the window, and my birthday party in a tent, playing pass the parcel in the pouring rain. Rain is still my favourite weather\". As a girl, her dreams were to become a dancer and prime minister, because she \"liked the idea of being in charge\".\n\nBaker travelled widely as a teenager spending three years visiting France, Corsica, Italy, Greece and Switzerland, before ending up on Cape Clear, an island off the southern tip of Ireland, \"because there was a ferry leaving to go there\". She trained as a dancer at Bush Davies ballet school and left with six O-levels, but later abandoned A-levels in Drama, English and History at Norwich City Tech for London.\n\nHer initial career ambition was politics, inspired by her mother's environmental activism as well as her relationship with PR boss Matthew Freud, son of the ex-Liberal MP Clement Freud, whom she met while working as a waitress in London. She said: \"I got into it when I was 18. My boyfriend’s father was Clement Freud, and I used to help out. I loved it. Nicholas Parsons would be there stuffing envelopes, and I'd be out chatting to people... It really suited me knocking on doors going \"Hello! How are you? How are things for you? Is your MP helpful? What could be better round here? Oh, I see what you mean ... Terrible state of the roads\".\n\nTo supplement her modest income, Baker began glamour modeling as a \"Page 3\" girl at age 17 before she was discovered by noted erotic photographer Byron Newman. When asked about what influenced her decision, she answered, \"I really didn't have any problems about my body. It wasn't ever an ambition. It was just one of those things—if you are a certain height with a certain look and a certain pneumatic silhouette—sooner or later in that sort of company it's a bit inevitable really\". She claimed that her comfort with posing nude was due to the liberating influence of her mother, Margaret Ayrton, a Witch. She said \"I suppose being brought up by hippies as parents, I had absolutely no problem being naked. The problems I had were actually wrestling with the whole sort of feminist thing. I tried to justify it to myself that there were loads of jobs that I thought were equally demeaning because they had such a low wage. When I waitressed, my take home pay was what I could earn in two hours modelling\". She attributes her buxom figure to a combination of rigorous ballet-training and having Irish and Welsh ancestry.\n\nBaker was first approached to pose for \"Penthouse\" but turned them down and did her Playmate shoot in 1986 when she was 18. When the March 1987 issue of \"Playboy\" was released to newsstands she had only recently turned 19. In 1995 Baker wrote a lengthy article about her experiences as a Playmate for the London edition of \"Time Out\" magazine.\n\nBaker has appeared in two films: the 1987 TV movie \"Casanova\", starring Richard Chamberlain, and the 1990 short film \"Man from China\". She also acted in the musical \"Forever Elvis\" (in the role of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley), and played Nina in a stage production of Chekov's \"The Seagull\". By this time, she got involved in fighting chemical factories, ran a campsite with a cafe, worked on a goat farm, looked after a child and ran a community theatre.\n\nFollowing the death of a boyfriend she retired from acting and modeling while still in her early twenties and for a brief time went back to waitressing in England. Back home, she decided to further her education and completed a BA (Hons) in journalism from the London College of Printing and an MA in dramatic writing from the University of Sussex. She ended up doing work experience at the \"News of the World\", before joining the London \"Evening Standard\". During the 1990s, Baker worked extensively as a journalist, most often for \n\"The Independent\", \"The Telegraph\" and \"The Guardian\" newspapers, as well as \"Punch\" (where she was the Punch milkmaid), and \"Junior Magazine\" in the United Kingdom.\n\nShe is known today as a practising Wiccan and author of several children's books on Witchcraft, including \"Spells for the Witch in You\"; \"Spells for Teenage Witches: Get Your Way with Magical Power\"; \"Marina Baker's Teenage Survival Guide\"; and \"Spells for Cats\" (the last was published under the name Daisy Pepper). In 2001, she worked as a magic consultant for a BBC documentary about the \"Harry Potter\" books.\n\nBaker is active in local politics in the Lewes area of England, now working under her married name of Marina Pepper.\n\nIn 2006, she chaired the Lewes district council, where she represented the coastal communities of East Saltdean and Telscombe Cliffs, just five miles east of the cosmopolitan hub of Brighton in Sussex. She lost her seat on 3 May 2007 when she was defeated for re-election by the Conservatives.\n\nShe has also served as the mayoress of Telscombe and during the 2005 General Election she stood (unsuccessfully) for Parliament in the Brighton Kemptown constituency as a Liberal Democrat. She has been quoted as saying, somewhat facetiously, \"I'm not sure Page Three girls can become MPs\".\n\nBaker is active in a number of local environmentalist programs such as the Saltdean \"walking bus\", which accompanies a line of children to school, reducing the number of cars on the road and giving the children \"a good bit of exercise\" before school. She has also set up a community recycling scheme for a local preschool and ran eco-fairs to help promote understanding of sustainable living.\n\nAs a member of the Telscombe town council, she takes an active role in REGEN—part of the Local Strategic Partnership—where she organises projects to promote social economic and environmental well-being in the towns of Peacehaven, Telscombe and East Saltdean.\n\nShe organises regular REGEN events in the community, including \"The Circle\", a sustainability fair which has run in conjunction with Telscombe's Town fair, RANDOMfreeFEST—a youth festival in Peacehaven—and \"Cool Yule\", a seasonal market held at the beginning of the Christmas shopping season, promoting local food and gifts.\n\nMarina also appeared in the 2011 documentary \"Just Do It\" on environmental activism.\n\nIn July 2013 she was arrested by police for obstruction when she joined a protest against fracking in Balcombe in West Sussex.\n\n\n\n"}

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1990 to 2003 for the Texas Rangers, Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox and Detroit Tigers. He also served as the bullpen coach and first base coach for the Boston Red Sox. Haselman was a 1st round selection in the 1987 Major League Baseball draft.\n\nHaselman was born in Long Branch, New Jersey and graduated from Saratoga High School in Saratoga, California. He attended UCLA where he played for the UCLA Bruins baseball team as an understudy to Todd Zeile. He also played for the UCLA Bruins football team as a substitute quarterback behind starting quarterback Troy Aikman.\n\nHe was drafted as the 23rd pick of the 1st round of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft by the Texas Rangers. He began his professional career that year for the Gastonia Rangers of the South Atlantic League. In 1988, he was promoted to the Port Charlotte Rangers of the High-A Florida State League, where he hit .245 in 122 games.\n\nHaselman spent 1989 and 1990 with the AA Tulsa Drillers of the Texas League. He was a September call-up with the Rangers in 1990 and made his Major League debut at the age of 24 as a pinch hitter on September 3, 1990, against the Cleveland Indians. He recorded his first hit, also as a pinch hitter, off Joe Klink of the Oakland Athletics on September 27. In 14 games, he had two hits in 13 at-bats.\n\nHe returned to the minors and spent 1991 and the first part of 1992 with the Oklahoma City 89ers of the AAA American Association.\n\nOn May 29, 1992, he was selected off waivers by the Seattle Mariners, who assigned him to the Calgary Cannons of the Pacific Coast League, where he hit .255 in 88 games with 19 home runs and 53 RBI. He also got into 8 games for the Mariners in September and had five hits in 19 at-bats. \n\nHe spent most of 1993 as the Mariners back-up catcher and hit his first home run on May 8 off of Jim Deshaies of the Minnesota Twins. On June 6, 1993, Haselman was hit by a pitch thrown by Baltimore Orioles pitcher Mike Mussina, leading to him charging the mound and igniting a bench-clearing brawl. In parts of three seasons with Seattle, he appeared in 104 games and hit .234 with 6 home runs and 24 RBI. \n\nHe signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox on November 7, 1994 and played with the Red Sox through the 1997 season as a backup catcher. Haselman's most dramatic offensive performance came in a game at Fenway Park against the Toronto Blue Jays on June 27, 1995. With the bases empty and the score tied 5-5, he pinch hit for catcher Mike Macfarlane in the bottom of the 11th inning. Haselman shattered his bat, sending a Woody Williams' offering sailing over the Green Monster to give the Red Sox their first walk-off win of their 1995 Eastern Division winning campaign.\n\nHaselman had his best season in 1996, when he hit .274 with 8 HR and 34 RBI in a career-high 237 At bats for the Red Sox. He also led American League catchers with a 7.64 range factor.

Boston then offered him a position managing in the minor leagues, and while he said he was tempted, he did not want to spend that much time away from his family. Haselman then went into private business and worked as a post game host during Seattle Mariners' games. \n\nIn 2010, he returned to baseball as the manager of the Class A Bakersfield Blaze, a California League affiliate of the Texas Rangers.

{"id": "2003693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003693", "title": "The Queen Victoria", "text": "The Queen Victoria\n\nThe Queen Victoria (more often referred to as The Queen Vic or The Vic) is the Victorian public house in the BBC soap opera, \"EastEnders\". It has the fictional address of 46 Albert Square, Walford, London E20. \n\nIn the series' backstory, Albert Square was built around 1860 during the reign of Queen Victoria. In February 2020 Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) revealed that the original landlords of The Queen Victoria were Mr and Mrs Bagstock, and that he’d drowned his wife in the bath. Originally the pub was to be called The Balmoral but after the death of Prince Albert it was renamed as a tribute to the mourning Queen. In reality, Albert Square is based on the real Fassett Square in Hackney, but there is no pub there so The Queen Victoria is based on what was once College Park Tavern on Harrow Road in Harlesden. Initially, the pub's exterior is first seen painted brown. This is later changed to a green and cream colour scheme before Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) sets alight to the Queen Victoria in 1992, after which it is painted red. Following another blaze in 2010, the pub is painted red, green and cream. On Boxing Day 2013, the new family to the square, the Carters, took over the Queen Vic and since then it has had a refurbishment and has been painted red once again.\n\nDuring the first months of the show, The Queen Victoria has a partition wall down the middle of the bar which separates it into two sections. The smaller section, known as the 'snug', houses a dart board and fruit machines, whilst the larger section, known as the saloon bar, is used primarily as the customer seating area. Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) gets permission from the brewery to remove the partition in 1985, and hires Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) to do the job. In 2007 the pub has its first refurbishment in 15 years, and another in late 2010.\n\nIn reality the pub exterior shell on the outdoor permanent set was built during 1984 for the new series the following year. The exterior shell was made to look as though it had stood for a hundred years. The internal sets are in a studio separate from the building situated in the Square.\n\n\"Inside Soap\" said that the pub was the most \"haunted\" location in \"EastEnders\", considering the number of characters who have died in or outside the building, including Den, Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb), Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements), Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) and Tom Clements (Donald Tandy).\n\nIn a storyline shown during September 2010, The Queen Victoria was severely damaged by a fire. This allowed for a subtle redesign and upgrade of the set; required when high-definition broadcasting commenced. A separate set was built on the George Lucas sound stage at Elstree Studios to enable the pub interior to be set alight safely.\n\nA team of nearly forty-five crew members were involved in the filming of the fire including makeup, stunt team, fire safety officers, cameras, lighting, sound and the costume department. The exterior scenes took five half days to shoot (as it could only be shot at night) and were shot at the BBC studios in Borehamwood. The interior scenes were shot a week after and took three days to film.\n\nSafety necessitated having the set re-created at the Elstree Film Studios stage facility that is designed and equipped to film fire scenes. EastEnders Production Manager Rona McKendrick says \"Potentially hazardous scenes like this always require specialist knowledge and we rely on their experience and advice to ensure that everything is achieved as safely as possible. We had a Stunt Team comprising Lee Sheward, our Stunt Co-ordinator and his team of Stunt Doubles. A Visual FX team designed and executed all the fire sequences and we had specialist Fire Officers providing out of vision fire cover / safety.\"\n\nOf the fire itself, McKendrick said \"Everyone was very sad to see The Vic taken out of Stage One and moved to Elstree Film Studios for the burn, I've known the set for 18 years and to see the enormous space it left was as if a piece of history had been removed\".\n\nIn the \"EastEnders\" series spin-off \"CivvyStreet\" (1988) life in Albert Square is featured between 1939 and 1945, and The Queen Victoria (The Queen Vic) freehold is owned by the brewery, Luxford & Copley. Ray and Lil Sewell (Robert Putt and Frances Cuka) are the landlords. When the series begins, the brewery remain owners and Den (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) have been landlords for ten years; previous landlords alluded to in conversation include Gus and Flo Leonard and Alf and Polly Barrett. In 2020, Sharon Watts gives Mick Carter a photograph of Mr and Mrs MK Bagstocks, the first landlords of the Queen Vic. She told Linda Carter that Mr Bagstocks drowned his wife in the bath.\n\nAngie is served with divorce papers by Den on Christmas Day 1986 and two years later he passes control to Frank (Mike Reid) and Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). In 1990, Frank and Pat hand over the pub to Eddie Royle. Eddie is murdered by Nick Cotton (John Altman) the following year, and the daughter of Den and Angie, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), becomes the first licensee when she buys the freehold of The Queen Vic with the assistance of her husband Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and his brother Phil (Steve McFadden); the three live there. Grant sets fire to the pub in 1992 in an insurance scam and it is refurbished. Grant and Sharon divorce and their share of The Queen Vic is sold to Grant's mother, Peggy (Barbara Windsor). Peggy marries Frank in 1999 and he again becomes a landlord. When Grant leaves Walford, Peggy's alcoholic son Phil sells his share of pub to Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for a mere £5 to spite his domineering mother. However, he subsequently buys back his share and evicts Dan from The Queen Vic. After Frank disappears and leaves her penniless, Peggy is forced to sell the pub in early 2001. The new buyer is revealed to be Sharon, in partnership with Steve Owen (Martin Kemp). Steve has to sell his share to raise ransom money for his wife Mel (Tamzin Outhwaite) and Phil buys back part of The Queen Vic. In 2002, Sharon also sells up to Phil and the pub returns to the control of the Mitchells. Peggy appoints Alfie Moon as manager later that year.\n\nIn 2004, Den tricks his way back into ownership of The Queen Vic, and within a few months he is killed by his second wife, Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman), who buries his body in the cellar of pub. Chrissie forges his signature on a deed of transfer and tells the customers that he has left Walford, signing The Queen Vic over to her. Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) digs up Den's body and Chrissie, in a plan to escape, sells the pub to Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and is subsequently arrested for murder. Her confessing to forging his signature nullifies the sale to Ian and ownership reverts to Sharon, Den's heir. Sharon returns The Queen Vic to Peggy and Phil. When Sam (now played by Danniella Westbrook) breaks bail in 2009, the family goes into debt. Phil secures The Queen Vic against a loan from Ian, who is forced to sell it to Peggy's ex-husband Archie (Larry Lamb). The Mitchells initially continue running the pub but Peggy relents and hands over control to Archie and his fiancée Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) after her step daughter Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) suffers a miscarriage during a confrontation with her father Archie. After Archie is murdered on Christmas Day, his daughter Roxy (Rita Simons) inherits The Queen Vic. When Roxy tries to sell it on, Peggy objects, and Roxy signs over the pub to her. Later in 2010, Phil develops a drug addiction and is locked in a room in the pub by Peggy. After he escapes, he argues with his mother and sets fire to the pub as an act of revenge. The fire traps him and Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) along with her baby Lily, but they all manage to escape.\n\nAgain, fire destroys The Queen Vic and Peggy transfers ownership to Phil before she leaves Walford. Phil renovates the pub and rents it to Alfie Moon and his wife Kat (Jessie Wallace). Kat is away temporarily in 2012 when Roxy again is landlady but upon Kat's return, The Queen Vic is forced to close down due to an outbreak of bed bugs, the source of which was thought to be Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), who has been staying. Instead, it was found that the source was the flat where Kat was meeting her lover Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). The Queen Vic returns to Phil when Kat and Alfie fail to pay rent and Roxy is again made manager. However, Phil has a change of mind about Kat and Alfie when he finds out from Kat about her affair and subsequent attempt to save her marriage, all the while leaving Roxy as manager. During Christmas 2012, Alfie finds out about the affair, they separate and Roxy and Amy move back to The Queen Vic. Roxy replaces Kat as the joint licensee of the pub with Alfie, but leaves after Alfie reunites with Kat on the day of his and Roxy's wedding. As an act of revenge against the Moons, Phil decides to sell the pub and Alfie and Kat are forced to move out. Janine initially tries to buy the pub, but is arrested for murder before paying Phil. Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) buys The Queen Victoria on Christmas Day, 2013, and the following day moves into the pub with his wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) and son Johnny Carter (Sam Strike). Phil is surprised to discover that Mick is Shirley's brother. When Shirley persuades their estranged father into giving them £10,000 to repair the rising damp in the cellar, Mick and Linda give Shirley a 10% stake in the pub.\n\nIn 2016, Mick and Linda's son, Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) gets into debt, and Mick pays it off by taking out loans. The family struggle to pay for court fines after Babe Smith (Annette Badland) sells alcohol outside of licensing hours, repairs to a leaking roof, for Sylvie Carter's (Linda Marlowe) funeral, and vets bills for their dog, Lady Di (Hot Lips). While Linda and Mick are away, Linda sends Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan) to look after the pub as a manager. Max Branning (Jake Wood) hears of the Carters' financial problems and suggests to Shirley that they sell the freehold of the pub. Shirley convinces Linda but they do not tell Mick, and Shirley forges his signature. The new freeholders, Grafton Hill, send Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner), a business consultant, to look at ways to maximise profit at the pub, and she concludes that two members of staff need to be made redundant, but insists that the freeholders want Woody to stay, so Sharon, and barmaid Tracey (Jane Slaughter) are made redundant. It then emerges that the company Max works for, Weyland & Co, are involved and they have a mole in the pub, as the company is planning to redevelop the local area and The Queen Vic is their first target. It is soon revealed that Fi is the mole, and Grafton Hill makes them pay for further repairs. Fi tricks the Carters into thinking the debt is less, so when they fail to pay, they are given a month to leave and it is revealed that Fi's father, James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) is the owner. However, after Fi realises that James is a rapist, who had raped Kathy back in 1988 and he is arrested for fraud, she offers the Carters the chance to buy the Vic back, which they are eventually able to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her stage career lasted more than six decades.\n\nBorn Madeleine Angela Clinton-Baddeley in West Ham, London in 1904 into a wealthy family, she would later base the character of Mrs. Bridges on one of the cooks her family employed. Her younger sister was actress Hermione Baddeley.\n\nIn 1912, Angela and Hermione enrolled as pupils at Margaret Morris's dancing school in Chelsea. Angela described the school as \"a wonderful foundation for all my work on the stage.\" In the same year, the eight-year old Angela made her stage début at the Dalston Palace of Varieties, Dalston, in a play called \"The Dawn of Happiness\". When she was nine, she auditioned at the Old Vic Theatre. In November 1915 she made her début at the Old Vic in \"Richard III\", and she subsequently appeared in many other Shakespeare plays.\n\nDuring her teenage years, the \"consummate little actress\", as a national paper had once called her when she was 10, starred in many musicals and pantomimes. She briefly 'retired' from acting at age 18. Her first marriage, to Stephen Thomas, produced one daughter. On 8 July 1929 she married actor/stage director Glen Byam Shaw; they had two children, a son and a daughter.\n\nAfter spending some time touring in Australia, Baddeley established herself as a popular stage actress. At the beginning of the 1930s she appeared in two films, the Sherlock Holmes tale, \"The Speckled Band\" (1931), featuring Raymond Massey as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's sleuth, and in \"The Ghost Train\" (also 1931), a screen version of the successful stage thriller. Throughout the 1940s, she played many strong female roles on stage, including Miss Prue in \"Love for Love\" and Nora in \"The Winslow Boy\".\n\nShe played the bawd in Tony Richardson's production of \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\" at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1958. She played Mistress Quickly in several episodes of the BBC Shakespeare history series \"An Age of Kings\" (1960), performing with her sister Hermione as Doll Tearsheet. In the original version of \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" (1971–75) she played Mrs. Kate Bridges, the resident cook at 165 Eaton Place, who, when the show ended, married the butler, Mr. Angus Hudson (Gordon Jackson). A spin-off series featuring the characters’ married life failed to materialise due to Baddeley’s death.

Born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, she moved to England in 1957, and then to the United States in 1961. For the past 45 years she has been engaged in research on sexual violence against women and girls. She has written numerous books and articles on rape, including marital rape, femicide, incest, misogynist murders of women, and pornography. For \"The Secret Trauma\", she was co-recipient of the 1986 C. Wright Mills Award. She was also the recipient of the 2001 Humanist Heroine Award from the American Humanist Association. She was also an organizer of the First International Tribunal on Crimes against Women, in Brussels in March 1976.\n\nRussell was born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, the fourth of the six children of a South African father and a British mother. After completing her Bachelor's degree from the University of Cape Town, at the age of 19, Russell left for Britain.\n\nIn Britain, she enrolled in a Post-Graduate Diploma in Social Science and Administration at the London School of Economics and Political Science. In 1961, she passed the Diploma with Distinction and also received the prize for the best student in the program. She moved to the United States, in 1963 where she had been accepted into an interdisciplinary PhD program at Harvard University. Her research focused on sociology and the study of revolution.\n\nRussell's research focus probably stems from her own involvement in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. In 1963, Russell had joined the Liberal Party of South Africa that had been founded by Alan Paton, the author of \"Cry the Beloved Country\". While participating in a peaceful protest in Cape Town, Russell was arrested with other party members. She came to the conclusion that non-violent strategies were futile against the brutal violence and repression of the white Afrikaner police state. Thereafter, she joined the African Resistance Movement (ARM), an underground revolutionary movement fighting apartheid in South Africa. The principal strategy of the ARM was to bomb and sabotage government property, and though Russell was only a peripheral member of the ARM, she still risked a 10-year incarceration if caught.\n\nRape and other forms of sexual exploitation and abuse of women has been one of the primary focuses of Russell's research and writings. In her book, \"The Politics of Rape\" (1975), Russell suggested that rape was a display of socially defined perceptions of masculinity instead of deviant social behavior. Her other books in this area are \"Rape in Marriage\" (1982), \"Sexual Exploitation: Rape, Child Sexual Abuse, and Workplace Harassment\" (1984). In 1986, Russell published \"The Secret Trauma: Incest in the Lives of Girls and Women\" (1986). It was one of the first scientific research study of incestuous sexual abuse to be published. For it she received the C.Wright Mills Award in 1986. In 1993, she edited an anthology on pornography, \"Making Violence Sexy: Feminist Views on Pornography\". Her 1994 book, \"Against Pornography: The Evidence of Harm\", which includes 100 pornographic photos, was a study establishing how pornography encourages men to rape and leads to increased incidents of rape.\n\nRussell lobbied other feminists for two years and eventually was successful in organizing the first International Tribunal on Crimes against Women in Brussels, Belgium, in 1976. The conference which lasted for four days, in which individual women from different countries testified to their personal experiences of various forms of violence and oppressions because of their gender, was attended by 2,000 women from 40 countries. By the second day it had dissolved into disaster, as \"radical activists were storming the stage one after another in an improvised free-for-fall\".\n\nSimone de Beauvoir in her introductory speech to the Tribunal said: \"I salute the International Tribunal as the beginning of the radical decolonization of women.\" Later, Belgian feminist Nicole Van de Ven documented the event in a book, \"Crimes Against Women: The Proceedings of the International Tribunal\" (1976).\n\nIn 1976 Russell redefined ‘Femicide’, as \"the killing of females by males because they are female.\" At the International Tribunal on Crimes Against Women, she testified to numerous examples of lethal forms of male violence against women and girls from different cultures around the world. Russell's intention was to politicize the term, and bring attention to the misogyny driving these lethal crimes against women, which she said gender-neutral terms like murder don’t do. Russell who is puzzled about the lack of response of women's groups in the United States to the use of the term 'Femicide' still continues to advocate the use of 'Femicide' to women's groups in the United States and around the world. She explains that in order to deal with these extreme crimes against women, it necessary to recognize that like race based hate crimes, \"Femicides are [also] lethal hate crimes\", and that most killings of women by men are \"extreme manifestations of male dominance and sexism.\"\n\nIn 1993, Russell initiated an organization called Women United Against Incest, which supports incest survivors with legal assistance against their perpetrators. Similarly, she created the first TV program in South Africa where incest survivors talk in person about their experiences.\n\nFeminist movements in many countries in Latin America, as in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Chile, and El Salvador among others, have adopted the use of Russell's politicized 'Femicide' and have successfully used it socially, politically and legally to address lethal violence against women in their respective countries. In 1992, she co-edited an anthology, \"Femicide: The Politics of Woman Killing\".\n\nIn 1977, Russell became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.\n\n\n\n"}

It was recorded during his 1978 world tour and is composed mostly of the artist's \"greatest hits\". The performances in the album are radically altered from the originals, using the same musicians that backed \"Street-Legal\", but relying on a much larger band and stronger use of brass and backing singers. In some respects the arrangements are more conventional than the original arrangements, for which the album was criticized. For a few critics, such as Janet Maslin of \"Rolling Stone\", the differences between the older and newer arrangements had become less important.\n\nThe audio recording is from shows on February 28 and March 1, 1978. Columbia Records released this double LP in Japan on August 21, 1978. Later that year, it was released in Australia and New Zealand. On April 23, 1979, spurred by extensive importing and at least one counterfeit European edition, Columbia released the album to worldwide markets. The shows were the fourth and fifth in an eight-show appearance at Nippon Budokan Hall in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n\"Bob Dylan at Budokan\" received some of the worst reviews of Dylan's career. Critically savaged, it was derided as \"slick\" and \"sterile.\" \n\nIn a sarcastic review published in his \"Consumer Guide\" column, Robert Christgau gave the album a C+ rating, writing \"I believe this double LP was made available so our hero could boast of being outclassed by Cheap Trick, who had the self-control to release but a single disc from this location.\" Critic Jimmy Guterman named it one of the worst albums ever released in the history of rock.\n\nHowever, the album received stronger reviews in Europe, and critic Janet Maslin (then a music critic for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine) defended the album in her review. \"The method here is hit-or-miss, and the results are correspondingly spotty,\" Maslin wrote. \"The fire and brimstone are behind Dylan, [but] this hardly means the fight has gone out of him: \"Bob Dylan at Budokan\" is a very contentious effort—and, for the most part, a victorious one.\" Fire and brimstone were to again become very much a part of Dylan's music, with the release of his album \"Slow Train Coming\" later in 1979.\n\n\"Bob Dylan at Budokan\" reached in the U.S. and went platinum, while simultaneously peaking at in the UK.\n\n\n"}

Sjöfn is attested in the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in three kennings employed in skaldic poetry. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.\n\nIn chapter 35 of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\", High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur. High lists Sjöfn seventh, and says that Sjöfn is \"concerned to direct people's minds to love, both women and men.\" In addition, High states that from Sjöfn's name comes the Old Norse word \"sjafni\". In the Nafnaþulur section appended to the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Skáldskaparmál\", chapter 75, Sjöfn is included in a list of 27 names of ásynjur. Otherwise, the name \"Sjöfn\" is thrice employed as a base word in skaldic kennings for \"woman\".\n\nRegarding the information given about Sjöfn in \"Gylfaginning\", John Lindow says that the word \"sjafni\" does indeed appear listed in the þulur as a word for \"love\", yet that outside this description no information about the goddess is known. Lindow states that some scholars theorize that Sjöfn may be the goddess Frigg under another name. Rudolf Simek says that Snorri may have derived his etymology of \"Sjöfn\" from the Old Norse words \"sefi\" (\"sense\") or from \"sefi\" (possibly \"relation\"), but that the scant references to Sjöfn do not allow for much more of an elaborate explanation for the goddess. Simek says that, accordingly, Sjöfn is viewed as a goddess of \"marriage and love, or else one of relationships\" and that Sjöfn is among several goddesses mentioned in the \"Prose Edda\" \"who are matron-like guardian-goddesses.\"\n\n"}

Michael Straczynski about 113 people (called \"Specials\") born with special abilities following the appearance of a mysterious light in the sky above Pederson, Illinois. The series explores how society may react to the advent of superpowers, and how those who are Specials may react towards society and each other. \"Rising Stars\" was one of the first comics produced under Straczynski's own \"Joe's Comics\" imprint for Top Cow Productions.\n\nThe comic was published in August 1999, monthly at first by Top Cow/Image Comics, and then under the Joe's Comics imprint. Within a few months, however, there were unscheduled artist changes and unexplained delays by Top Cow in shipping the comics—sometimes lasting months.\n\nThe comic itself came to an unexpected halt after issue 21 due to internal arguments between Straczynski and Top Cow. Straczynski claimed he was cut out of the loop on the potential \"Rising Stars\" movie. After communication broke down between them, he held back the scripts for the last three issues, and the entire comic was put on hold. In addition to an apology for the way Straczynski was treated in regard to the possible film, Top Cow relented by giving him the full rights to an anthology comic he had written for them, \"Dream Police\" (later published by Marvel Comics), as well as the rights to the name and logo for the Joe's Comics imprint.\n\nThe last issue of \"Rising Stars\" was published in March 2005. During the intervening time, Straczynski had gone on to write a revamp of Marvel's \"Squadron Supreme\", \"Supreme Power\".\n\nThe story is narrated from the future by the last living Special, John Simon, nicknamed \"Poet\". The genesis of the Specials is shown to be the unforgettable descent of a fierce comet from the heavens. The story starts when the Specials are all grown up, but it constantly flashes back to when they were children. Through these flashbacks, the development of these 113 Specials is shown, starting with the government's monitoring and handling of the events, to the manifestation of their powers, to the impact of these abilities on the afflicted children and the world around them. Some of the Specials use their powers for the good of the world, others for personal benefit and fame, while others simply wish to forget about them and live a normal life.\n\nA series of murders of the Specials spurs John to investigate. He learns that when a Special dies, their \"energy\" transfers to the remaining Specials, making each more powerful. This fact had become known to a Special with multiple personality disorder, who calls herself Critical Maas. It emerges that Maas has been manipulating \"Patriot\" (the alter ego of Jason Miller) to kill other Specials so her own power would be increased. At the instigation of Maas, the U.S. government also attacks the Specials, killing more. With her newly increased powers, Maas and a handful of Specials under her telepathic control are able to conquer Chicago, claiming it for themselves.\n\nTen years pass and John, his half-brother Randy Fisk (alter ego: Ravenshadow), Elizabeth Chandra, and Joshua Kane (alter ego: Sanctuary) lead the rest of the Specials in an attempt to liberate Chicago after the U.S. government promises that all charges against them will be dropped. Maas is defeated, but at a price: Matthew Bright, who had been sent by the government to assist in her defeat, is beaten into a coma by Patriot, while the latter was still under Maas' control.\n\nSeeing that internecine conflict was not what they were empowered for, John proclaims that he wants them all to act as a unit so they can help humanity. The violence in Chicago affected the rest of the Specials as well and they all agree to assist John in his mission.\n\nAnother ten years pass, and their mission is almost complete. Humanity has been helped by the Specials, and more importantly, has been given the confidence and resources to further help themselves. But after Randy Fisk wins the Presidency, elements in the U.S. government, seeing the Specials as a threat to their power, plot to assassinate the remaining few.\n\nA bomb, specifically designed to destroy even the most powerful Special, is set off during a gathering of almost all the Specials, excepting John who is busy working on a secret project. All present are killed, including Randy and John's lover, Elizabeth Chandra.\n\nThe released power is initially distributed amongst all the people of the world, instantly curing all forms of illness and injury. It also grants everyone limited telepathy, bringing an end to all wars, violence, and strife as people become aware of the thoughts and feelings of those they had previously viewed as their enemies. Those involved in the mass assassination voluntarily come forward and confess. For 24 hours, not a single human being dies.\n\nAfter that blessed 24 hours, the power soars into the sky and seeks out John, giving him all its power and knocking him out for seven days. He uses that power to provide energy for the project he had been working on: a space ship that travels near the speed of light.\n\nThe immense power within John directs the ship to yet another world, an alien planet much like Earth. John's ship erupts into a fireball, strikingly similar to the one that had empowered the Specials, as it comes crashing down onto the planet's surface. It can be assumed that a process similar to what happened with the Specials would happen to this planet's populace. The circle has been completed.\n\nThere are 113 Specials, with the story focusing on a select few and often featuring appearances by others.\n\n\nAt first, the Specials possessed varying levels of power, ranging from the clearly superhuman, such as Matthew Bright and Jason Miller, to almost negligible abilities like being invisible when not in direct sunlight. However, when a Special died, the energy they possessed was evenly distributed among the rest, making them stronger. In an incident similar to the Waco Siege, a number of Specials were killed. The resultant transfer of energy, later known as the Surge, was enough to turn all specials regardless of their standing into high powered individuals.\n\n\nThe first \"Rising Stars\" spin-off, a three-issue miniseries, written by Fiona Avery, penciled by Dan Jurgens and published in Feb–Apr 2003, is about Matthew Bright's rookie years as a police officer in the NYPD under the name Brendan Miller, after he left Pederson.\n\nThe six-issue miniseries \"Rising Stars: Voices of the Dead\" features Lionel Zerb, a Special who can see dead people, and was published in Apr–Dec 2005. It was again written by Fiona Avery, with pencils by Staz Johnson and Al Rio. It concentrates on various mysteries Lionel uncovers because of his ability.\n\nThe five-issue miniseries \"Rising Stars: Untouchable\" features Laurel Darkhaven, a Special who worked for the CIA as an assassin. Written by Fiona Avery with pencils by Brent Anderson. Published February 2006 – June 2006.\n\nTypical of Straczynski, the beginning and end of the story were planned before he wrote the first issue. It was set to span 24 issues, and neatly divide up into three acts. Each trade paperback collects one of those acts.\n\nAll the publications are collected in one volume:\n\n\nIn 2016, MGM optioned Rising Stars, with Straczynski slated to write the script and Alex Gartner and Richard Suckle to produce for Atlas Entertainment.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2005, a novelization of \"Rising Stars\" by Arthur Byron Cover was published in a three-volume series.\n\n\n"}

He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1976 and a Tony Award in 1981.\n\nWeston, a Cleveland, Ohio native, usually played comic roles in films such as \"Cactus Flower\" (1969) and \"Please Don't Eat the Daisies\" (1960). He occasionally took on heavier parts, such as the scheming crook and stalker who, along with Alan Arkin and Richard Crenna, attempts to terrorize and rob a blind Audrey Hepburn in the 1967 film \"Wait Until Dark\".\n\nWeston had countless character roles in major films such as \"The Cincinnati Kid\" and \"The Thomas Crown Affair\". On television he made numerous appearances such as murderer Fred Calvert in the 1958 \"Perry Mason\" episode, \"The Case of the Daring Decoy\". In 1961, he was a guest star in the TV drama \"Route 66\", playing the manager of a traveling group of young women nightclub dancers, who mistreats his employees. In 1963, he was a guest star in an episode called \"Fatso\" in the TV drama \"The Fugitive\".\n\nIn 1976, he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for his performance in the film \"The Ritz\". In 1981, Weston appeared on Broadway in Woody Allen's comedy \"The Floating Light Bulb\", for which he was nominated for a Tony Award as Best Actor. Other stage appearances included \"Bells are Ringing\" in 1956 (with Judy Holliday), \"The Ritz\" in 1975, Neil Simon's \"California Suite\" (1976) and \"One Night Stand\" in 1980.\n\nWeston co-starred in Alan Alda's 1981 film \"The Four Seasons\", and then reprised his role to star in a television series spinoff on CBS.\n\nWeston served in the United States Army during World War II. Weston married twice, first to actress Marge Redmond, noted for her role in the ABC sitcom \"The Flying Nun\". They occasionally appeared together, an example being a 1963 episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" titled \"The Bard\". Redmond and Weston divorced. The couple had no children.\n\nHis second marriage was to Laurie Gilkes and they had one child together. They were married until his death from lymphoma on May 3, 1996, after a six-year struggle. He was 71 years old.\n\nJack was the older brother of Anthony Spinelli, whose birth name was Sam Weinstein and whose first stage name was Sam Weston. The Westons were Jewish.\n\nIn 1949, Weston appeared as Mr. Storm in episode 5 of \"Captain Video and His Video Rangers\".\n\nIn the 1960–1961 television season, Weston appeared as Chick Adams, a reporter, on the CBS sitcom \"My Sister Eileen\".\n\nThe next season, 1961–1962, he starred in the short-lived sitcom \"The Hathaways\" (ABC), in which he and Peggy Cass adopted a trio of chimpanzees (the Marquis Chimps).\n\nHe also made guest appearances on such television series as \"Peter Gunn\", \"Perry Mason\", \"Rescue 8\", \"The Twilight Zone\" (episodes \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\", and \"The Bard\"), \"The Untouchables\", \"Have Gun – Will Travel\", \"Johnny Staccato\", \"Thriller\", \"The Lawless Years\" (2 episodes), \"Route 66\", \"Harrigan and Son\", \"Stoney Burke\", \"Breaking Point\", \"The Fugitive\", \"Bewitched\", \"Gunsmoke\", \"Twelve O'Clock High\", \"Laredo\", \"Tales of the Unexpected\", \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", \"The Carol Burnett Show\", \"All in the Family\", and \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\".\n\n"}

He resisted playing stereotypically black roles, instead performing in several productions with New York City's Shakespeare Festival Theater, Leland Hayward's satirical NBC series \"That Was the Week That Was\", and a poetry performance tour of the United States in addition to his work in television and film.\n\nIn 1976, Browne was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Comedy or Drama Series for his work on ABC's \"Barney Miller\". In 1986, he won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Performer in a Comedy Series for his work on NBC's \"The Cosby Show\". In 1992, he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance as \"Holloway\" in August Wilson's \"Two Trains Running.\"\n\nIn 1995, he received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program for his performance as \"The Kingpin\" in \"Spider-Man.\"\n\nBrowne was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame in 1977 and posthumously inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nBorn in Woodbury, New Jersey, Browne was the fourth son of Baptist minister Sylvanus S. Browne and his wife Lovie (née Lovie Lee Usher). He graduated from Woodbury Junior-Senior High School in 1939. Browne attended historically black Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. While there, he became a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1946.\n\nDuring World War II, he served in Italy with the United States Army's 92nd Infantry Division and organised the Division's track and field team. After the war, he undertook postgraduate work at Middlebury College, Columbia University, and the University of Florence. A middle-distance runner, he won two Amateur Athletic Union 1,000-yard national indoor championships.\n\nHe occasionally returned to Lincoln University between 1946–52 to teach English, French, and comparative literature. Upon leaving academia, he earned a living for several years selling wine for Schenley Import Corporation. In 1956, he left his job with Schenley to become a full-time professional actor.\n\nDespite the apprehensions of his friends, Browne managed to land the roles of soothsayer and Pindarus in \"Julius Caesar\", directed by Joseph Papp for New York City's first Shakespeare Festival Theater. More work with the Shakespeare Festival Theater followed, and he voiced an offscreen part as camera operator J.J. Burden in \"The Connection\" (1961), his first movie role. In \"The Cowboys\" (1972) in a role as a camp cook, he led a group of young cowhands avenging the death of John Wayne's character in the movie.\n\nBrowne was much in demand for narration and voice-over parts in film and on commercial sound recordings. In 1968–69, he was heard as a late-night disc jockey on WNEW-FM in New York reciting poetry and passages from the Bible and assorted literary works. In 1977, Browne narrated a record album, \"The Story of Star Wars\", which presented an abridged version of the events depicted in the first released film utilizing the dialogue and sound effects. The recording was produced by George Lucas and Alan Livingston.\n\nBrowne was determined not to accept stereotypical roles which had routinely been offered to African-American actors. He also wanted to do more than act and narrate. In 1966, he wrote and made his directorial stage debut with \"A Hand Is On The Gate\", starring Cicely Tyson, James Earl Jones, and Moses Gunn. A lifelong bachelor who coveted his privacy in the turbulent decades of the civil rights revolution, Browne avoided participation in public protests, preferring instead to be \"more effective on stage with metaphor...than in the streets with an editorial\".\n\nHis stage success brought him to the attention of producer Leland Hayward, and in 1964 he began a regular stint as a cast member on Hayward's satirical NBC-TV series \"That Was the Week That Was\". Starting in the late 1960s, Browne increasingly became a guest star on TV on both comedy and dramatic shows like \"Mannix\", \"All in the Family\", \"Good Times\", \"Sanford and Son\", \"The Cosby Show\", \"A Different World\" and dozens of other shows. He also was a regular on \"Soap\" where he played Saunders, the erudite butler from 1979–81. Browne later guest-starred on \"Benson\" with Robert Guillaume, who had himself previously been in the cast of \"Soap\". Browne's appearances on \"The Cosby Show\" won him an Emmy Award in 1986 for his guest role as Professor Foster.\n\nHe and fellow actor Anthony Zerbe toured the United States with their poetry performance piece \"Behind the Broken Words\" which included readings of poetry, some of it written by Browne, as well as performances of comedy and dramatic works.\n\nBrowne found additional success performing in the plays of August Wilson, both on Broadway and the Pittsburgh Public Theater. He was described as having \"a baritone voice like a sable coat\", speaking the King's English with a strong mid-Atlantic accent. To someone who once said Browne sounded \"too white\", he replied, \"I'm sorry, I once had a white maid.\" Four years before his death, Browne narrated a series of WPA slave narratives in the HBO film, \"Unchained Memories\" (2003).\n\nBrowne's directorial credits include a piece called \"An Evening of Negro Poetry and Folk Music\" at the Delacorte Theatre and the Public Theatre in New York City in 1966. It was also produced as \"A Hand Is on the Gate\" at the Longacre Theatre in New York City in 1966. The production was also revived at the Afro-American Studio in New York City from 1976 to 1977.\n\nSome year-of-birth records, including the Social Security Death Index, report Browne born on May 2, 1922, while other sources claim that Browne's date of birth was three years later, on May 2, 1925. Those sources include \"The New York Times\", \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Variety\", the Associated Press and several others, including a Congressional Resolution.\n\nIn an undated videotaped interview with Camille Cosby for the National Visionary Leadership Project (NVLP), Browne said: \"I was born, Camille, so they say, May 2, 1922, in Woodbury, New Jersey.\"\n\nBrowne died of stomach cancer in Los Angeles on April 11, 2007, aged 84. He never married and had no children.\n\nHe was remembered for his contributions in a \"New York Times\" encomium by Frank Crohn of the Edna St. Vincent Millay Society:\n\nWe mourn the loss of our long-time Trustee and faithful friend. He was always to be counted upon to be supportive of the aims and purposes of the Society. He filled our lives with the soft sound of poetry as only he could recite it. Now the stage is empty and the lights are low.\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated the Christmas story on a Christmas card and cassette tape alongside Glenda Hayes who sung silent night\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2003802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003802", "title": "U.S. Route 48", "text": "U.S. Route 48\n\nCorridor H of the Appalachian Development Highway System, also known as U.S. Route 48 (US 48), will extend from northern Virginia to central West Virginia. It is being constructed from Interstate 79 (I-79) in Weston eastward across the crest of the Allegheny Mountains to I-81 in Strasburg, Virginia.\n\nWest Virginia's segment of Corridor H crosses very mountainous terrain, some of the most rugged in the eastern United States and crosses two major rivers. There are more than 1000 historic structures, five historic districts, two Civil War battlefields and other archaeological sites within five miles (8 km) of Corridor H, and the highway will cross through two national forests. There are over 50 species of plants and animals that are protected under the Endangered Species Act and more than 150 native trout streams, thousands of acres of wetlands and high mountain bogs, areas of karst terrain, abandoned coal mines and numerous recreational facilities within the Corridor H study area.\n\nTwo previous highways were designated as US 48. The first, in California, was incorporated into the route of US 50; the second, in western Maryland and West Virginia, was redesignated Interstate 68 (I-68).\n\nThe US 48 designation follows the route of Corridor H in West Virginia from Interstate 79 in Weston to the Virginia state line near Wardensville.\n\nUS 48 is fully signed along the portion of current State Route 55 (Virginia SR 55) west of I-81. The route begins at the West Virginia state line at the highway's summit of Great North Mountain, signed as US 48 and WV 55 from Wardensville. Entering Virginia, US 48 heads northeast as two-lane Wardensville Pike through George Washington National Forest and descends the mountain to the hamlet of Star Tannery, where the highway leaves Frederick County by crossing Cedar Creek. The road's name changes to John Marshall Highway, and it passes around the northern end of Little North Mountain near the community of Wheatfield, turning south. US 48 passes through the Shenandoah County communities of Lebanon Church and Clary on its way to a diamond interchange with I-81, which serves as US 48's eastern terminus.\n\nThe Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 was passed as part of an effort to stimulate economic growth in Appalachian rural areas. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was created by the act, which also authorized the ARC to create the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). The Appalachian region, as defined by the act, stretches from Mississippi to New York. Congress defined it to \"provide a highway system which, in conjunction with the Interstate System and other Federal-aid highways in the Appalachian region, will open up an area or areas where commerce and communication have been inhibited by lack of adequate access\". Some 23 transportation corridors were to be developed as part of the ADHS, and Corridor H was designated in 1965.\n\nCorridor H has had a particularly controversial history as conservationists and environmentalists vied with federal agents, developers and the business community over the issue of what constituted the most environmentally sensitive route among several alternatives.\n\nThis current designation for Corridor H is inconsistent with the AASHTO numbering scheme, which places east–west U.S. Routes in ascending numerical order southward across the continental U.S. The current route is located south of US 50 and north of US 60 and therefore should have a route number in the 50s.\n\nCorridor H was originally envisioned as an Appalachian Regional Development (ARD) corridor highway that was to run from Weston, West Virginia to Strasburg or New Market, Virginia via Elkins, West Virginia. This proposed four-lane highway soon became one of the most controversial APD corridor highways in West Virginia that would lead to numerous legal (and political) battles within the state. The state was forced to deal with numerous Environmental and economic issues, a battle that would continue for 40 years.\n\nThe route was to follow U.S. Route 33 from Weston to Seneca Rocks, West Virginia, where two alignments to the east were proposed. One alignment would follow a new alignment over North Fork Mountain and Foremost Mountain to New Market, Virginia, while another proposal called for an alignment paralleling WV 55/VA 55 to Strasburg, Virginia. A timeline of construction completions are as followed:\n\nApproximately was completed from Interstate 79 at Weston to Elkins.\n\nAnother segment was completed from Canfield to Bowden just east of Elkins and was dubbed the \"racetrack\" for its vast improvement over the old alignment and its isolation from other four-lane highways. A northern bypass of Elkins was to connect the two segments of Corridor H, however, it was never constructed as the segments east of Bowden were met with intense opposition. Meanwhile, an alignment following U.S. Highway 33 to Seneca Rocks and then WV 55/VA 55 to Strasburg, Virginia was favored within the West Virginia Department of Transportation.\n\nIn 1981, the West Virginia Department of Transportation began planning for a new alignment east of Bowden along U.S. Highway 33 and WV 55/VA 55. A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was issued. Funding issues, however, caused the project to be put on hold until 1990. No Final Environmental Impact Statements or Record of Decisions were completed.\n\nIn 1990, the project was resurrected and a reevaluation of the Corridor H alignment east of Bowden was conducted. A new DEIS was prepared and all corridors considered in the 1981 DEIS were studied equally. Scoping meetings were held that October. The purpose and need documentation was completed in March 1992 and a Corridor Selection Draft Environmental Impact Statement (CSDEIS) was completed in October.\n\nIn 1993, a revised EIS was published with a new route to go north from Elkins to Moorefield and then into Virginia. Many citizens, however, felt that improving existing routes would be a better alternative. Of the 4,000 comments written in 1995 at public meetings, over half opposed the new Corridor H alignment. They cited the damage to two national forests, 41 streams, historical sites, Civil War battlefields, farms and Main Street businesses. For some, the costs outweighed the benefits.\n\nIn October 1994, an Alignment Selection Draft Environmental Impact Statement (ASDEIS) was issued. The DEIS focused on alignment selection within the preferred corridor identified within the CSDEIS.\n\nIn April 1996, a Federal Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was issued that consisted of a revised version of the ASDEIS along with some of the CSDEIS. In September, a Record of Decision was issued on the preferred alignment east of Bowden.\n\nIn October 1998, the first contract for Corridor H's construction east of Elkins was awarded from US 33 to US 219.\n\nA segment of Corridor H opened to traffic on August 12, 2002. This segment of four-lane expressway stretches from CR 11 west of Elkins to CR 7 near Kerens and includes one interchange in the project for U.S. Highway 219. This was finished under six contracts totaling $87.6 million. The then-Governor Bob Wise celebrated the historic opening with Senator Robert C. Byrd and Transportation Secretary Fred VanKirk.\n\nOn August 19, a three-mile (5 km) segment was dedicated from CR 1 to CR 23/4 that was constructed under two contracts totalling $24.1 million. This completed the nine-mile (14 km) phase one segment.\n\nThis segment of Corridor H travels through Randolph and Tucker counties; more specifically from County Route 7 near Kerens to a future U.S. Highway 219 interchange approximately two miles east of Parsons. Proceeding northward from County Route 7, it would have a span at Wilmouth Run and County Route 3. The alignment then turns more northeastward, entering the Monongahela National Forest, crossing the South Branch of Hadix Run Road and U.S. Highway 219. It has one final water crossing at Cheat River before concluding at County Route 219/4.\n\nIn Parsons, a public informational meeting was held on September 26, 2000. Alignments were studied and a Settlement Agreement allowed construction to continue on segments in Hardy and Randolph counties. It was also chosen to avoid the Corricks Ford Battlefield.\n\nAlternative \"DF\" was chosen as the preferred alternative for the highway and in October 2001, the Federal Highway Administration gave the go-ahead for the Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement. The Federal Environment Impact Statement was completed in April 2002 with the Record of Decision approved in June of that year.\n\nThe Department of Highways received approval for the Supplemental Final Environmental Impact Statement in October 2002. The commenting period was extended 60 days to February 25, 2003. The Amended Record of Decision was approved on May 12, 2003.\n\nSix consultants were hired to provide the final design for the segment of Corridor H from Kerens to Parsons. Final design has not yet been completed, with construction of the segment from Kerens to a point north of the Randolph County/Tucker County border (but not all the way to Parsons) scheduled to begin in mid-2016.\n\nPhase III is a nine-mile (14 km) expressway from two miles (3 km) east of Parsons to immediately east of Davis along West Virginia Route 93 within Tucker County.\n\nOn December 4, 2002, the Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement was approved after additional Environmental investigations were completed. The additional analysis was a result of the West Virginia Northern Flying Squirrel, a federally endangered species that was discovered in the vicinity. A public hearing was held on February 6, 2003 at the Blackwater Lodge in Davis, with comments on the meeting turned in by April 22. The Thomas-Davis city council had until June 19 to review the situation. The Supplemental Final Environmental Impact Statement was expected to be approved on the segment in June 2005, with the FHWA expected to sign the Amended Record of Decision in August 2005, however, the discovery of the West Virginia Northern Flying Squirrel delayed the project; WVDOH had to conduct additional environmental investigations.\n\nThe Supplemental Final Environmental Impact Statement (SFEIS) was approved in 2007. However, a reevaluation of the SFEIS is underway, specifically for updated endangered species surveys. The issuance of the Amended Record of Decision (AROD) is to be determined. Final design is anticipated to begin in 2025, and construction is scheduled to begin in 2031.\n\nThis segment of Corridor H stretches through Tucker and Grant counties. The alignment runs from West Virginia Route 93, east of West Virginia Route 32 near Davis to Bismarck near the intersection of West Virginia Route 42 and West Virginia Route 93. The Federal Highway Administration issued a record of decision on March 23, 2001 that cleared the way for design, right-of-way purchases, and construction for this segment. A contract was awarded in December 2010 to Trumbull Corporation for the construction of 6.2 miles of Corridor H, from the existing corridor at Bismarck in Grant County to the WV 93 connector at Mount Storm in Tucker County; this section opened by November 2014. A contract was awarded in August 2012 to JF Allen for the construction of the remaining 9.9 miles portion of the Davis to Bismarck section, from east of WV 32 to the WV 93 Connector at Mount Storm, and this section opened in November 2016.\n\nThis completed section totals within Grant County.\n\nThe record of decision was issued in July 2001. The original timeline was to begin acquiring right-of-way in June 2003, bid contracts in August 2004 and begin construction in September 2004 with a completion date in September 2006. Greenland Gap activists, however, began documenting the Gap's civil war history and natural features and successfully persuaded the West Virginia Department of Highways to move the alignment 1/4 of a mile away from the Gap. This spared several houses in a neighboring village and reduced the effect the highway would have on the Gap. A one-mile (1.6 km) access road between the village of Greenland and West Virginia Route 93 was eliminated and an interchange was moved from between Greenland and West Virginia Route 93 to two miles (3 km) north of Scherr for West Virginia Route 93.\n\nConstruction began in spring 2007 and completed in November 2013. The section from County Route 3 east to Forman and Moorefield opened in October 2010. A further section from WV 93 to CR 3 opened on October 23, 2012. The final section, from WV 93 near Scherr to the WV 42 connector at Bismarck, opened November 22, 2013.\n\nThe sixth phase in Corridor H's completion from Elkins to the state line, it travels through Grant and Hardy counties for a total length of . This phase also includes three miles (5 km) of upgraded highway from US 220 to WV 55 just east of Moorefield; the mainlines for Corridor H are .\nThe first section of this phase to open was a three-mile (5 km) four-lane highway from US 220 to the WV 55 interchange in November 2005. In August 2005, two grade and drain contracts were awarded on both sides of the South Branch Potomac River, with construction beginning that September. Construction completed on both contracts on the spring of 2007.\n\nIn July 2006, two grade and drain contracts were awarded west of the South Branch Potomac River.\n\nOn August 8, 2006, it was announced that were to be graded for paving at a cost of $23,747,933. This segment began construction in September and was completed in August 2008.\n\nDuring the same month, South Branch Potomac River Bridge contract was awarded. The $30,884,656 contract, located just north of Moorefield, will contain a single eight-span steel girder bridge over the South Branch of the Potomac and a seven-span crossing over the adjacent floodplain. The bridge will utilize 4,300 tons of steel. Construction began in September with a completion date set for August 1, 2009.\n\nThe section from Moorefield to Knobley Rd, west of Forman, was opened in late October 2010.\n\nOn May 31, 2000, ground was broken on the Moorefield to Baker section of Corridor H. Nearly 1,000 supporters were present.\n\nOn June 1, 2000, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) informed the \"West Virginia Division of Highways that it has made a determination of the effects of an alternative alignment of Corridor H near Moorefield on historic properties.\" Sam Beverage, acting Secretary for the Department of Transportation, stated that the Meadows and the P.W. Inkeep House were both to the alignment chosen for Corridor H but would not be impacted.\n\nJune 5, 2000 was the starting date for two segments in Hardy county. of partial controlled-access highway in the first segment, totaling $20,746,510 included 2,810,416 cubic yards (2,148,717 m³) of excavation, three access roads to farms, two structural plate drainage pipes and a six-span prestressed concrete beam bridge over Lick Run and CR 6.\n\nAnother segment at a cost of $12,499,009 was let to construction as well. of highway would extend the first segment of Phase 7 to just south of the Baker interchange. This included 1,963,415 cubic yards (1,501,138 m³) of excavation, one farm access road, two structural plate drainage pipes and two out of the four ramps for the Baker interchange.\n\nOn August 30, 2000, of four-lane divided highway was let to construction. It stretched from CR 23/4 to CR 8 and had a price tag of $11.4 million.\n\nOn September 28, 2000, the Department of Transportation announced that the construction of a four-lane partial controlled-access highway connecting West Virginia Route 55 to the Clifford Hollow Bridge will involve the construction of two bridges and of roadway. The cost for this segment was $29.6 million. A second project would connect the Clifford Hollow Bridge to county route 1 and involve of construction at a cost of $15.2 million.\n\nA segment of roadway was let to construction on October 18, 2000 at a cost of $9,864,718. This segment stretched from CR 23/4 to CR 8.\n\nThe final segment of Phase 7 was let to construction on November 2, 2000 for the Clifford Hollow Bridge at a cost of $17.8 million. It was completed in October 2003.\n\nA three-mile (5 km) segment of highway from County Route 1 to County Route 23/9 opened to traffic in August 2002. On November 17, 2002, a five-mile (8 km) section of roadway opened from County Route 23/9 to the Baker interchange. With the completion of the Clifford Hollow Bridge in October 2003, the segment of Corridor H through Hardy county between Moorefield and Baker was opened to traffic.\n\nIn December 2000, the Federal Highway Administration issued the Record of Decision on this segment of Corridor H.\n\nA construction contract was awarded on October 1, 2001 to construct a segment of Phase 8 from Hanging Rock to County Route 23/8 in Hardy county. This segment is located just east of the Lost River bridge near McCauley and cost $12,891,522.\n\nAnother contract was awarded on December 5, 2001 at a total of $18,549,091 to construct of Corridor H from County Route 23/8 to the west approach of the Lost River bridge. Grading and drainage required 3.3 million cubic yards (2,500,000 m³) of earthwork, including over 1 million cubic yards (800,000 m³) of \"borrow\" material and several pipes to carry small streams underneath the roadway. A three-span fabricated steel girder bridge was constructed to carry the four-lane divided highway over Sauerkraut Run.\n\nDecember 21, 2001 was another important day, as a section was awarded at a cost of $25,019,472. It stretched from the Baker interchange and extended to the west side of the bridge crossing the Lost River in Hardy county. The remaining two incomplete ramps at the Baker interchange were completed.\n\nOn March 4, 2002, the Department of Highways awarded a contract to construct a segment of Corridor H at a cost of $15,858,045 that extended from Lost River Sinks to County Route 23/12. This included landscaping for the historic Hott House as part of the construction mitigation program and involved the construction of a connection to existing West Virginia Route 55. This segment required 4.3 million cubic yards (3,200,000 m³) of earthwork, drainage, paving, signing and pavement markings. It was completed in the fall of 2003.\n\nThe completion of the Lost River Bridge at McCauley signaled the end of construction on phase 8. The segment opened to traffic in mid-October 2006.\n\nThis phase of Corridor H (US 48) stretches from Wardensville to West Virginia Route 55 at the Virginia state line.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the Federal Highway Administration and the West Virginia Department of Transportation would defer construction, along with final design and right-of-way acquisition on the section of roadway between Wardensville and the Virginia state line for as long as 20 years. This delay could be shortened if Virginia approves their section of Corridor H (US 48) between the West Virginia state line and Interstate 81, if traffic increases significantly on West Virginia Route 55 between Wardensville and the state line, or if required to ensue eligibility for Appalachian highway corridor funding.\n\nThe Amended Record of Decision was approved on May 16, 2003.\n\nCorridor H Alternatives (CHA) filed a lawsuit, the first for the project since its realignment, in U.S. District Court in November 1996 challenging the Record of Decision for the entire Corridor H project. The lawsuit stated that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) violated the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) by \"failing to consider an improved roadway alternative (IRA) and by failing to prepare a Supplemental EIS to consider the impacts of the Corrick's Ford Battlefield alignment shift.\" The lawsuit further states that the FHWA \"violated laws by issuing a Record of Decision prior to completing the evaluation of Corridor H's impacts\" on historic structures and lands.\n\nIn 1997, briefs were filed and oral arguments took place. In October, the U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the Federal Highway Administration and the West Virginia Department of Transportation on all counts, however, CHA appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n\nBriefs were once again filed in 1998 and oral arguments were presented throughout the year. In September, the CHA filed a second lawsuit that challenged the FHWA's findings of \"no constructive\" use for two properties. In November of that year, the Court system ordered the Department of Transportation to halt construction of Corridor H except for a section near Elkins.\n\nIn 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the FHWA and the West Virginia Department of Transportation on the first lawsuit. On the second lawsuit, the court ruled in favor of CHA, stating that \"all studies of historic properties must be completed before construction proceeds.\" In March, the Court dismissed the second lawsuit without prejudice, and allowed the CHA to file a new lawsuit challenging the decisions of the FHWA and the West Virginia Department of Transportation when Section 106/section 4(f) is complete for the entire Corridor H project. In May, a court order was produced that prohibited the FHWA from proceeding further with Corridor H until they have completed the Section 106 process and issued an amended Record of Decision. There were two exceptions to this however: work was allowed to proceed on the \"Northern Elkins Bypass\" and design work was allowed to proceed. This was the segment of Corridor H between Elkins and Kerens, or Phase I.\n\nIn December 1999, an agreement was reached. The Corridor H project was to be divided into nine separate projects from Elkins, West Virginia to the Virginia state line. As stated in the agreement, impacts were to be avoided near Corricks Ford/Shavers Fork Valley and Blackwater Canyon; the completion of ongoing studies; and the deferment of the Wardensville, West Virginia to Virginia state line segment with final design and right-of-way acquisition restricted until specific conditions are met not to exceed 20 years. This delay could be shortened if Virginia approves their section of Corridor H (US 48) between the West Virginia state line and Interstate 81, if traffic increases significantly on WV 55 between Wardensville and the state line, or if it is required to ensue eligibility for Appalachian highway corridor funding.\n\nThe agreement also established alternative dispute resolution procedures and that the plaintiffs were to waive the right to bring future lawsuits against the FHWA and the West Virginia Department of Transportation that would seek any further study of any alternative that does not include completing Corridor H as a continuous four-lane highway.\n\nOne of the leading firms on the Corridor H project, the Michael Baker Corporation proposed and designed two wetland mitigation sites. In addition, Baker, in conjunction with the West Virginia Department of Highways and the Federal Highway Administration, developed a \"comprehensive mitigation plan for vegetative, water quality, acid drainage and wildlife issues for the entire 100+-mile long project.\"\n\nMichael Baker Corporation's scientists also completed extensive surveys for endangered plant and animal species. Identified were the buffalo clover, the Indiana bat, the Virginia big-eared bat, Cheat Mountain salamander and the West Virginia northern flying squirrel. Based on this, Baker assisted the Department of Highways and the FHWA in conjunction with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to prepare a biological assessment for the Indiana bat, which resulted in a finding that Corridor H will not adversely affect the habitat. A formal consultation is ongoing for the West Virginia northern flying squirrel.\n\nNo work or planning has started on this segment of Corridor H yet. Virginia will most undoubtedly wait until West Virginia completes most of their segments before completing their small segment from the West Virginia state line to Interstate 81 near Strasburg, Virginia.\n\nIn April 2003, new US 48 signs were installed along State Route 55 in Virginia. While State Route 55 will not be the final alignment of Corridor H through this region, it will be a temporary transition as West Virginia completes their portions to the state line.\n\nVirginia also designated State Route 55 a Virginia Scenic Byway. Plans are in the works with VDOT to maintain the existing facility and continue to make spot improvements.\n\nThe former Western Maryland Railroad that stretched through eastern West Virginia was opened in 2003, only instead of carrying train cars, it will serve hikers and bikers. This \"rail to trail\" project was built in conjunction with the construction of Corridor H. It includes parking areas, restroom facilities, and walking trails. These projects will total approximately and cost around $1.5 million. Two segments that were constructed from Parsons to Montrose and from Montrose to Elkins were awarded on February 20, 2001. It was named the Allegheny Highland Trail.\n\nThe Division of Highways received the Federal Highway Administration's 2001 Environmental Award in the cultural resources category for the educational tools and web sites based on the Reed Farmstead archaeological dig on Corridor H.\n\nState Highway Engineer Joe Deneault explained when the 200-year-old farm was discovered, the Division of Highways wanted to share the process of how the Hardy County family's home would be uncovered and preserved. \"We wanted to share this process with the public,\" Deneault said. \" The Reed Farmstead was an amazing discovery and we decided that a video and web sites would be the best way to share this extensive archaeological dig with area residents. As the project progressed, it was clear that this could be an important educational tool for students as well.\"\n\nAn educational video was produced that illustrated the step-by-step process in the identification and preservation procedures taken by WVDOH. The video was shown for 60 days on the Corridor H web site and a videocassette was mailed to every school teaching grades eighth through twelfth in the state.\n\nThe WVDOH also developed two web sites based on the project: , that offers the history of the farm and details about the dig, and , which is an interactive site for children.\n\nThe award was presented to the WVDOH and to the two consultants, Michael Baker Jr., Inc. and Charles Ryan Associates, working on this project at a ceremony in Washington, D. C. on April 20.\n\nMaryland and West Virginia have begun planning an upgraded U.S. Route 220, possibly as an extension of Corridor O, to connect Corridor H to Interstate 68 near Cumberland, MD. Committees in Cumberland, Keyser, and Moorefield have been created to discuss the highway and thus far several plans have been established but one individual plan has not yet been chosen.\n\nUS 48 is one of the newest additions to the United States Numbered Highway system, having been commissioned in 2002. Before this designation, sections east of Moorefield, West Virginia to I-81 were known as West Virginia SR 55 and SR 55, and sections north of Elkins, West Virginia were known as US 219. West Virginia has US 48 signed sparsely within its borders.\n\nUS 48 is one of the few U.S. Route numbers to be used three times for three separate roadways. The first use of US 48 was in the 1920s, in Northern California, before being absorbed by US 50. The original \"US 48\" was one of the original routes in the United States Numbered Highways system. Assigned in 1926, it ran between US 99 at French Camp, California, outside Stockton, and US 101 at San Jose, California. By 1931, however, the route had been deleted. Most of the route later became part of US 50. US 48 was the first US highway to be deleted in California.\n\nThen, US 48 was designated for what is now I-68 before it entered the Interstate Highway System. Constructed as Corridor E of the ADHS as a replacement for a particularly primitive section of US 40, it was initially numbered US 48 when construction began in 1965; in 1991, however, it was redesignated as an interstate route.\n\n"}

These vessels were the backbone of service on the Tsawwassen – Swartz Bay route prior to the arrival of in 1993. Some of these vessels underwent vehicle capacity increases three times.\n\nThe vessels began to be retired in 2000. Four vessels were slated to be retired and sold in 2008. The transfer of \"Queen of Esquimalt\" was halted and she was broken up in Ensenada, Mexico. Both \"Queen of Nanaimo\" and \"Queen of Burnaby\" were retired in 2017. \"Queen of New Westminster\" is still in service with BC Ferries.\n\nA total of seven Victoria-class ferries were constructed.\n\nThe seven ships were modified twice in quick succession to increase vehicle capacity. The first refit was the installation of ramps and platform car decks and the second saw the ships sliced in half vertically across the beam for the insertion of a new midsection, which dramatically increased their capacity.\n\nLater, four of the seven ships were cut horizontally from bow to stern to have a new vehicle deck inserted. These rebuilt ships retained the V-class designation. \"Queen of Burnaby\" and were two original ships without the new car deck; they received a new designation as vessels. \"Queen of Burnaby\" retired in May 2017 (replaced by MV \"Salish Orca\") and \"Queen of Nanaimo\" was retired in September 2017 (replaced by MV \"Salish Eagle\").\n\nThe last of the seven ships, , was lifted in 1991 and was fit with new engines to travel at speeds comparable to the newer ferries. \"Queen of New Westminster\" was also dropped from the V-class designation, and is now officially unclassed. She had a major refit of her passenger areas completed in 2009, preparing her for another ten to fifteen years of service, and will be the sole survivor of the original seven ships.\n\n\"Queen of Vancouver\" (scrapped)\nFormer MV \"City of Vancouver\"\nBuilt: Vancouver, British Columbia, 1962\nRetired: April 15, 2009 – Sold to Coast Marine, moored at Woodfibre until 2012, sent for scrapping to Ensenada, Mexico\nLength: 129.9 m (426 ft)\nPower: 9,000 hp (6.7 MW)\nPropulsion: Two MaK 9MU551AK\nService speed: 18.5 knots (34 km/h)\nGross tons: 9,357.22\nCar capacity: 338\nPassenger & crew capacity: 1,708\nRoute: Tsawwassen – Swartz Bay\n\"Queen of Saanich\" (scrapped)\nBuilt: Victoria, British Columbia, 1963\nRetired: November 18, 2008 – Sold.

{"id": "2003810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003810", "title": "List of commercial failures in video games", "text": "List of commercial failures in video games\n\nThe list of commercial failures in video games includes any video game software on any platform, and any video game console hardware, of all time. As a hit-driven business, the great majority of the video game industry's software releases have been commercial failures. In the early 21st century, industry commentators made these general estimates: 10% of published games generated 90% of revenue; that around 3% of PC games and 15% of console games have global sales of more than 100,000 units per year, with even this level insufficient to make high-budget games profitable; and that about 20% of games make any profit.\n\nSome of these failure events have drastically changed the video game market since its origin in the late 1970s. For example, the failures of \"E.T.\" and \"Pac-Man\" for the Atari 2600 contributed to the video game crash of 1983. Some games, though commercial failures, are well received by certain groups of gamers and are considered cult games.\n\nA commercial failure for a video game hardware platform is generally defined as a system that either fails to become adopted by a significant portion of the video game marketplace or fails to win significant mindshare of the target audience, and may be characterized by significantly poor international sales and general financial unviability of development or support.\n\nCo-designed by R. J. Mical and the team behind the Amiga, and marketed by Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins, this \"multimedia machine\" released in 1993 was marketed as a family entertainment device and not just a video game console. Though it supports a vast library of games including many exceptional third party releases, a refusal to reduce its price of until almost the end of the product's life hampered sales. The success of subsequent next generation systems led to the platform's demise and the company's exit from the hardware market. This exit also included The 3DO Company's sale of the platform's successor, the M2, to its investor Matsushita.\n\nIn 1990, Amstrad attempted to enter the console video game market with hardware based on its successful Amstrad CPC range but also capable of playing cartridge-based games with improved graphics and sound. This comprised the Amstrad CPC+ computers, including the same features as the existing CPCs, and the dedicated GX4000 console. However, only a few months later the Mega Drive, a much-anticipated 16-bit console, was released in Europe, and the GX4000's aging 8-bit technology proved uncompetitive. Many of the games are direct ports of existing CPC games (available more cheaply on tape or disc) with few if any graphical improvements. Fewer than thirty games were released on cartridge, and the GX4000's failure ended Amstrad's involvement in the video game industry. The CPC+ range fared little better, as 8-bit computers had been all but superseded by similarly priced 16-bit machines such as the Amiga, though software hacks now make the advanced console graphics and sound accessible to users.\n\nThe Pippin is a game console designed by Apple Computer and produced by Bandai (now Bandai Namco) in the mid-1990s based around a PowerPC 603e processor and Classic Mac OS. It featured a 4x CD-ROM drive and a video output that could connect to a standard television monitor. Apple intended to license the technology to third parties; however, only two companies signed on, Bandai and Katz Media, while the only Pippin license to release a product to market was Bandai's. By the time the Bandai Pippin was released (1995 in Japan, 1996 in the United States), the market was already dominated by the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation. The Bandai Pippin also cost US$599 on launch, more expensive than the competition. Total sales were only around 30,000 units.\n\nThe Atari 5200 was created as the successor to the highly successful Atari 2600. Reasons for the console's poor reception include that most of the games were simply enhanced versions of those played on its predecessor and its awkward controller design. The console sold only a little over a million units. When it was discontinued, its predecessor would be marketed for several more years as would its successor, the Atari 7800 which was marketed more carefully to avoid a similar debacle. Nonetheless, the failure of the Atari 5200 marked the beginning of Atari's fall in the console business.\n\nReleased by Atari Corporation in 1993, this 64-bit system was more powerful than its contemporaries, the Genesis and the Super NES (hence its \"Do the Math\" slogan); however, its sales were hurt by a lack of software and a number of crippling business practices on the part of Atari senior management. The controller was widely criticized as being too big and unwieldy, with a baffling number of buttons. The system never attained critical mass in the market before the release of the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, and without strong leadership to drive a recovery, it failed and brought the company down with it. Rob Bricken of Topless Robot described the Jaguar as \"an unfortunate system, beleaguered by software droughts, rushed releases, and a lot of terrible, terrible games.\"\n\nReleased in 1989 in North America and Europe; later in Japan in 1990 by Atari Corporation, The Atari Lynx is a 16 bit handheld game console that is the world's first handheld electronic game system with a color LCD. The Lynx was the second handheld game system to be released with the Atari name. The system was originally developed by Epyx as the Handy Game. The system is also notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and ambidextrous layout. In late 1991, it was reported that Atari sales estimates were about 800,000, which Atari claimed was within their expected projections. In comparison, the Game Boy sold 16 million units by later that year. Overall lifetime sales were confirmed as being in the region of 3 million, a commercial failure despite positive critical reviews. In 1996, Atari Corporation collapsed due to the failures of the Lynx and Jaguar consoles.\n\nThe Bally Astrocade is a second generation console created by Bally. It was released in 1977 but only through mail order. Due to weak sales, Bally quit the console business. Shortly afterward, another company purchased the rights to the console, and re-released it to weak sales again. Prominent games journalist Shaun Bradley described the Astrocade as \"Worse than \"The Room\"\".\n\nReleased only in Europe in 1990, the C64GS was basically a Commodore 64 redesigned as a cartridge-based console. Aside from some hardware issues, the console did not get much attention from the public, who preferred to buy the cheaper original computer that had far more possibilities. Also, the console appeared just as the 16-bit era was starting, which left no chance for it to succeed as it was unable to compete with consoles like the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Mega Drive.\n\nThe CDTV was launched by Commodore in 1991. In common with the Philips CD-i and the 3DO, the CDTV was intended as an all-in-one home multimedia appliance that would play games, music, movies, and other interactive content. The name was short for \"Commodore Dynamic Total Vision\". The hardware was based on the Amiga computer with a single-speed CD-ROM drive rather than a floppy disk drive, in a case that was designed to integrate unobtrusively with a home entertainment center. However, the expected market for home multimedia appliances did not materialize, and the CDTV was discontinued in 1993, having sold only 30,000 units. Commodore's next attempt at a CD-based console, the Amiga CD32, was considerably more successful.\n\nThe digiBlast portable console was launched by Nikko at the end of 2005 and promised to be a cheap alternative (selling at $117.86 or thereabouts and featuring a hardware similar to the Game Boy Advance) to the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. Cartridges for games, cartoon episodes (\"Winx Club\", \"SpongeBob SquarePants\"), and music videos were released on the handheld. A cartridge for MP3 playback and a cartridge with a 1.3-megapixel camera were released as add-ons. However, a shortage of chips around the release date resulted in a failed launch and loss of consumer interest.\n\nThe Dreamcast, released globally in 1999, was Sega's final console before the company focused entirely on software. Although the console was initially successful and management in the company improved significantly after harsh lessons were learned from the Sega Saturn fiasco, the console also faced stiff competition from the technically superior PlayStation 2 despite being in the market months ahead. The Dreamcast sold less than the Saturn, coming in at 9.13 million units compared to the Saturn's 9.5 million. The console's development was subject to further stress by an economic recession that struck Japan shortly after the console's release, forcing Sega, among other companies, to cut costs in order to survive.\n\nThe Fairchild Channel F was a second generation console released in 1976, and the first home console unit to use interchangeable video game cartridges. When the Atari 2600, which also used cartridges, was released a year later, the console was completely overshadowed. Only 250,000 Channel F units were sold.\n\nThe FM Towns Marty is a fifth generation console manufactured by Fujitsu. Throughout its few years in the market, the console sold an underwhelming 45,000 units.\n\nThe Gizmondo, a handheld video game device featuring GPS and a digital camera, was released by Tiger Telematics in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2005. With poor promotion, few games (only fourteen were ever released), short battery life, a small screen, competition from the cheaper and more reputable Nintendo DS, digiBlast and PSP, and controversy surrounding the company, the system was a commercial failure. On 23 January 2006, the UK arm of Tiger Telematics went into administration. Several high-ranking Tiger executives were subsequently arrested for fraud and other illegal activities related to the Gizmondo. It is so far the world's worst selling handheld console in history, and due to its failure in the European and American video game markets, it was not released in Australia or Japan. Tiger Telematics went bankrupt when it was discontinued in February 2006, just 11 months after it was released.\n\nReleased in late 2006 by Mattel, the HyperScan was the company's first video game console since the Intellivision. It used radio frequency identification (RFID) along with traditional video game technology. The console used UDF format CD-ROMs. Games retailed for $19.99 and the console itself for $69.99 at launch, but at the end of its very short lifespan, prices of the system were down to $9.99, the games $1.99, and booster packs $0.99. The system was sold in two varieties, a cube, and a 2-player value pack. The cube box version was the version sold in stores. It included the system, controller, an X-Men game disc, and 6 X-Men cards. Two player value packs were sold online (but may have been liquidated in stores) and included an extra controller and 12 additional X-Men cards. The system was discontinued in 2007 due to poor console, game, and card pack sales. It is featured as one of the ten worst systems ever by \"PC World\" magazine.\n\nReleased in Japan and Europe in 1994 and a year later in North America, the Neo Geo CD was first unveiled at the 1994 Tokyo Toy Show. Three versions of the Neo Geo CD were released: a front-loading version, only distributed in Japan, with 25,000 total units built; a top-loading version, marketed worldwide, as the most common model; the Neo Geo CDZ, an upgraded, faster-loading version, released in Japan only. The front-loading version was the original console design, with the top-loading version developed shortly before the Neo Geo CD launch as a scaled-down, cheaper alternative model. The CDZ was released on December 29, 1995 as the Japanese market replacement for SNK's previous efforts (the \"\"front loader\"\" and the \"\"top loader\"\"). The Neo Geo CD had met with limited success due to it being plagued with slow loading times that could vary from 30 to 60 seconds between loads, depending on the game. Although SNK's American home entertainment division quickly acknowledged that the system simply was unable to compete with the 3D-able powerhouse systems of the day like Nintendo's 64, Sega's Saturn and Sony's PlayStation, SNK corporate of Japan felt they could continue to maintain profitable sales in the Japanese home market by shortening the previous system's load-times. Their Japanese division had produced an excess number of single speed units and found that modifying these units to double speed was more expensive than they had initially thought, so SNK opted to sell them as they were, postponing production of a double speed model until they had sold off the stock of single speed units. As of March 1997, the Neo Geo CD had sold 570,000 units worldwide. Although this was the last known home console released under SNK's Neo Geo line, the newly reincarnated SNK Playmore relaunched the Neo Geo line with the release of the Neo Geo X in 2012.\n\nThe two handheld video game consoles, created by SNK Playmore (formerly SNK Corporation), were released between 1998-99 through markets dominated by Nintendo. The Neo Geo Pocket is considered to be an unsuccessful console, as it was immediately succeeded by the Color, a full color device allowing the system to compete more easily with the dominant Game Boy Color handheld, and which also saw a western release. Though the system enjoyed only a short life, there were some significant games released on the system. After a good sales start in both the U.S. and Japan with 14 launch titles (a record at the time) subsequent low retail support in the U.S., lack of communication with third-party developers by SNK's American management, the craze about Nintendo's \"Pokémon\" franchise, anticipation of the 32-bit Game Boy Advance, as well as strong competition from Bandai's WonderSwan in Japan, led to a sales decline in both regions. Meanwhile, SNK had been in financial trouble for at least a year – the company soon collapsed, and was purchased by American pachinko manufacturer Aruze in January 2000. Eventually on June 13, 2000, Aruze decided to quit the North American and European markets, marking the end of SNK's worldwide operations and the discontinuation of Neo Geo hardware and software there. The Neo Geo Pocket Color (and other SNK/Neo Geo products) did however, last until 2001 in Japan. It was SNK's last video game console, as the company went bust on October 22, 2001. Though commercially failed, the Neo Geo Pocket and Pocket Color had been regarded as influential systems. It also featured an arcade-style microswitched 'clicky stick' joystick, which was praised for its accuracy and being well-suited for fighting games. The Pocket Color system's display and 40-hour battery life were also well received. Although these were the last known systems released under SNK's Neo Geo line, the newly reincarnated SNK Playmore relaunched the Neo Geo line with the release of the Neo Geo X in 2012.\n\nA disk drive add-on and Internet appliance for the Nintendo 64, it was first announced at 1995's Nintendo Shoshinkai game show event (now called Nintendo World). The 64DD was repeatedly and notoriously delayed until its release in Japan on December 1, 1999. Nintendo, anticipating poor sales, sold the 64DD through mail order and bundled with its Randnet dialup subscription service instead of directly to retailers or consumers. As a result, the 64DD was supported by Nintendo for only a short period of time and only nine games were released for it. Most 64DD games were either canceled entirely, released as normal Nintendo 64 cartridges or ported to other systems such as Nintendo's next-generation GameCube. Upon announcement of the cancellation of Randnet in 2001, Nintendo reported a total of 15,000 current 64DD users on Randnet.\n\nMade by the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer Nokia, and released in 2003, the N-Gage is a small handheld console, designed to combine a feature-packed mobile/cellular phone with a handheld games console. The system was mocked for its taco-like design, and sales were so poor that the system's price dropped by $100 within a week of its release. Common complaints included the difficulty of swapping games (the cartridge slot was located beneath the battery slot, requiring its removal) and the fact that its cellphone feature required users to hold the device \"sideways\" (i.e. the long edge of the system) against their cheek. A redesigned version, the N-Gage QD, was released to eliminate these complaints. However, the N-Gage brand still suffered from a poor reputation and the QD did not address the popular complaint that the control layout was \"too cluttered.\" The N-Gage failed to reach the popularity of the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, or the Sony PSP. In November 2005, Nokia announced the failure of its product, in light of poor sales (fewer than three million units sold during the platform's three-year run, against projections of six million), and while video game software is still being produced for its Series 60 phones, Nokia ceased to consider gaming a corporate priority until 2007, when it expected improved screen sizes and quality to increase demand. However, Nokia's presence in the cell phone market was soon eclipsed by the iPhone and later Android phones, causing development to gravitate to them and sealing the fate of the N-Gage brand. In 2012, Nokia abandoned development on the Symbian OS which was the base for N-Gage and transitioned to the Windows Phone.\n\nThe Nuon was a DVD decoding chip from VM Labs that was also a fully programmable CPU with graphics and sound capabilities. The idea was that a manufacturer could use the chip instead of an existing MPEG-2 decoder, thus turning a DVD player into a game console. A year after launch only eight games were available. One game, \"Iron Soldier 3\", was recalled for not being compatible with all systems.\n\nThe Ouya is an Android based microconsole released in 2013. Even though the Ouya was a success on Kickstarter, the product was plagued by problems from the beginning. The console was very slow to ship and suffered hardware issues. On top of this, the console had a very limited library of games. The critical reception ranged from lukewarm to outright calling the console a 'scam'. Just two years after its release, the Ouya was in a dire financial situation and negotiated a buyout with Razer. Razer continued to run software services for Ouya until June 2019, on which the company deactivated all accounts and online services, rendering most apps unusable.\n\nThe PC-FX is the Japan-exclusive successor to the PC Engine (\"aka\" TurboGrafx-16), released by NEC in late 1994. Originally intended to compete with the Super Famicom and the Mega Drive, it instead wound up competing with the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo 64. The console's 32-bit architecture was created in 1992, and by 1994 it was outdated, largely due to the fact that it was unable to create 3D images, instead utilizing an architecture that relied on JPEG video. The PC-FX was severely underpowered compared to other fifth generation consoles and had a very low budget marketing campaign, with the system never managing to gain a foothold against its competition or a significant part of the marketshare. The PC-FX was discontinued in early 1998 so that NEC could focus on providing graphics processing units for the upcoming Sega Dreamcast. Around this time, NEC announced that they had only sold 100,000 units with a library of only 62 titles, most of which were dating sims.\n\nIn the 1980s, electronics company Philips together with Sony developed a new CD-based format called CD-i (\"Compact Disc Interactive\") for various multimedia software. The first consumer-oriented player from Philips launched in 1991 with a launch price of $700 (). Although not technically a game console, Philips increasingly marketed the format as a video game platform from 1994 onwards. It was originally intended to be an add-on for the Super NES, but the deal fell through. Nintendo, however, did give Philips the rights and permission to use five Nintendo characters for the CD-i games. In 1993, Philips released two Zelda games, \"\" and \"\". A year later, Philips released another Zelda game, \"Zelda's Adventure\", and a few months later, a Mario game titled \"Hotel Mario\". All four of these Nintendo-themed games are commonly cited by critics as being among the worst ever made. Much criticism was also aimed at the CD-i's controller. Although the Philips CD-i was extensively marketed by Philips, consumer interest remained low. Sales began to slow down by 1994, and in 1998, Philips announced that the product had been discontinued. In all, roughly 570,000 units were sold, with 133 games released.\n\nMade by the Pioneer LaserDisc Corporation in 1993 (a clone was produced by NEC as well), the LaserActive employed the trademark LaserDiscs as a medium for presenting games and also played the original LaserDisc movies. The LD-ROMs, as they were called, could hold 540 MB of data and up to 60 minutes of analog audio and video. In addition, expansion modules could be bought which allowed the LaserActive to play Genesis and/or TurboGrafx-16 games, among other things. Very poor marketing combined with a high price tag for both the console itself ($969 in 1993) and the various modules (e.g., $599 for the Genesis module compared to $89 for the base console and $229 for Sega CD add-on to play CD-ROM based games) caused it to be quickly ignored by both the gaming public and the video game press. Less than 40 games were produced in all (at about $120 each), almost all of which required the purchase of one of the modules, and games built for one module could not be used with another. The LaserActive was quietly discontinued one year later after total sales of roughly 10,000 units.\n\nFollowing the release of Nintendo's NES Classic Edition and SNES Classic Edition, microconsoles that included over 20 preloaded classic games from those respective systems, Sony followed suit with the PlayStation Classic. Like the Nintendo systems, the PlayStation Classic was presented as a smaller form factor of the original PlayStation preloaded with 20 games. It was launched in early December 2018 with a suggested retail price of . The system was heavily criticized at launch. For nine of the games, it used PAL versions (favored in European markets) rather than NTSC, meaning they ran at a slower 50 Hz clock compared to the 60 Hz used in the Americas, which caused notable frame rate problems and impacted the gameplay style for some of the more highly-interactive titles. The emulation also lacked the feature set that Nintendo had set with its microconsoles. The included game list, while varied by region, also was noted to lack many of the titles that had made the original PlayStation successful, and had a heavy focus on the early games on the console. Some of these absences were attributed to intellectual rights (for example, Activision holding the rights to \"Spyro the Dragon\", \"Crash Bandicoot\", and \"Tony Hawk's\"), but other omissions were considered odd and disappointing. The system sold poorly and within the month, its suggested retail price had dropped to . By April 2019, the price had dropped to , and \"CNET\" described the PlayStation classic as \"arguably one of the top flops of 2018.\"\n\nSony's second major handheld game console, the PlayStation Vita, was released in Japan in 2011 and in the West the following year. The successor to the PlayStation Portable, Sony's intent with the system was to blend the experience of big budget, dedicated video game platforms with the trend of mobile gaming. With a relatively low price, a robust launch title assortment, and a strong debut, analysts predicted the Vita would be a success. However, sales tanked shortly after release; for instance, during Christmas 2011, sales saw a 78% drop in Japan. By 2018, when Sony announced it would end physical game production for the system, the Vita had sold less than 15 million units. Hardware production for the Vita ended entirely in March 2019, and Sony does not plan to release a successor. \"GamesIndustry.biz\" attributed the Vita's failure to a number of factors, including competition from smartphones and Nintendo's rival 3DS platform, in addition to a general lack of support from Sony and other developers.\n\nBuilt upon the PlayStation 2, the PSX enhanced multimedia derivative was touted to bring convergence to the living room in 2003 by including non-gaming features such as a DVD recorder, TV tuner, and multi-use hard drive. The device was considered a failure upon its Japanese release due to its high price and lack of consumer interest, which resulted in the cancellation of plans to release it in the rest of the world. Not only was it an unsuccessful attempt by Sony Computer Entertainment head Ken Kutaragi to revive the ailing consumer electronics division, it also hurt Sony's media convergence plans.\n\nUnveiled by Sega at June 1994's Consumer Electronics Show, the 32X was later described as the \"poor man's entry into 'next generation' games.\" The product was originally conceived as an entirely new console by Sega Enterprises and positioned as an inexpensive alternative for gamers into the 32-bit era, but at the suggestion of Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Mega Drive/Genesis and made more powerful, with two 32-bit central processing unit chips and a 3D graphics processor. Nevertheless, the console failed to attract either developers or consumers as the Sega Saturn had already been announced for release the next year. In part because of this, and also to rush the 32X to market before the holiday season in 1994, the 32X suffered from a poor library of titles, including Mega Drive/Genesis ports with improvements to the number of colors that appeared on screen. Originally released at US$159, Sega dropped the price to $99 in only a few months and ultimately cleared the remaining inventory at $19.95. About 665,000 units were sold.\n\nThe Nomad, a handheld game console by Sega released in North America in October 1995, is a portable variation of Sega's home console, the Genesis (known as the Mega Drive outside of North America). Designed from the Mega Jet, a portable version of the home console designed for use on airline flights in Japan, Nomad served to succeed the Game Gear and was the last handheld console released by Sega. Released late in the Genesis era, the Nomad had a short lifespan. Sold exclusively in North America, the Nomad was never officially released worldwide, and employs regional lockout. The handheld itself was incompatible with several Genesis peripherals, including the Power Base Converter, the Sega CD, and the Sega 32X. The release was five years into the market span of the Genesis, with an existing library of more than 500 Genesis games. With the Nomad's late release several months after the launch of the Saturn, this handheld is said to have suffered from its poorly timed launch. Sega decided to stop focusing on the Genesis in 1999, several months before the release of the Dreamcast, by which time the Nomad was being sold at less than a third of its original price. Reception for the Nomad is mixed between its uniqueness and its poor timing into the market. Blake Snow of GamePro listed the Nomad as fifth on his list of the \"10 Worst-Selling Handhelds of All Time,\" criticizing its poor timing into the market, inadequate advertising, and poor battery life.\n\nThe Sega Saturn was the successor to the Genesis as a 32-bit fifth-generation console, released in Japan in November 1994 and in Western markets mid-1995. The console was designed as a competitor to Sony's PlayStation, released nearly at the same time. With the system selling well in Japan and Sega wanting to get a head start over the PlayStation in North America, the company decided to release the system in May instead of September 1995, which was the same time the PlayStation was going to be released in North America. This left little time to promote the product and limited quantities of the system available at retail. Sega's release strategy also backfired when, shortly after Sega's announcement, Sony announced the price of the PlayStation as being $100 less than the list price for the Saturn. The console also suffered from behind the scenes management conflicts and a lack of coordination between the Japanese and North American branches of the company, leading to the Saturn to be released shortly after the release of the 32X, which created distribution and retail problems. By the end of 1996, the PlayStation had sold 2.9 million units in the U.S., with only 1.2 million units sold by the Saturn. With the added competition from the subsequent release of the Nintendo 64, the Saturn lost market share in North America and was discontinued by 1999. With lifetime sales estimated at 9.5 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure. The cancellation of a game in the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series, known in development as \"Sonic X-treme\", has been considered a significant factor in the console's struggle to find an audience. The impact of the failure of the Saturn carried over into Sega's next console, the Dreamcast. However, the console gained interest in Japan and was not officially discontinued until January 4, 2001.\n\nThe uDraw GameTablet is a graphics tablet developed by THQ for use on seventh generation video game consoles, which was initially released for the Wii in late 2010. Versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were released in late 2011. THQ also invested in several games that would uniquely use the tablet, such as \"uDraw Pictionary\". The Wii version had positive sales, with more than 1.7 million units sold, prompting the introduction of the unit for the other console systems. These units did not share the same popularity; 2011 holiday sales in North America fell $100 million below company targets with more than 1.4 million units left unsold by February 2012. THQ commented that if they had not attempted to sell these versions of uDraw, the company would have been profitable that respective quarter, but instead suffered an overall $56 million loss. Because of this failure, THQ was forced to shelve some of its less-successful franchises, such as the \"Red Faction\" series. THQ would eventually file for bankruptcy and sell off its assets in early 2013.\n\nThis is perhaps the most critically acclaimed \"failure\" console. Though its independent monitor could display only monochrome visuals, the console's vector-based graphics and arcade-style controller with analog joystick allowed developers to create a strong games library with faithful conversions of arcade hits and critically praised exclusives. However, its release shortly before the North American video game crash of 1983 doomed it to an early grave.\n\n This red monochromatic 3-D \"virtual reality\" system was widely panned by critics and failed due to issues related to players getting eye strain, stiff necks, nausea, and headaches when playing it, along with the console's price and lack of portability. It came out in 1995 and was Nintendo's first failed console release. Gunpei Yokoi, the designer of the platform and the person largely credited for the success of the original Game Boy handheld and the \"Metroid\" series of games, resigned from the company shortly after the Virtual Boy ceased sales in order to start his own company, although for reasons unrelated to the console's success. The Virtual Boy was included in a \"Time\" \"50 Worst Inventions\" list published in May 2010.\n\nNintendo's Wii U was released in November 2012. It was designed as successor to the Wii to provide a more sophisticated experience and draw back \"core\" gamers that had dismissed the Wii, which they found was aimed for casual gameplay. The Wii U features the GamePad, the unit's primary controller with a touchscreen allowing for dual-screen play similar to the Nintendo DS line, or can be used for off-TV play. Though the Wii U received positive coverage, it had low sales of fewer than 14 million units by the end of 2016 compared to the Wii's lifetime of 101 million units. Nintendo executives attributed the poor sales of the Wii U to a combination of factors. They admitted their messaging of the Wii U's abilities had not been clear, leading to a general perception that the unit was primarily a tablet system or an add-on to the original Wii rather than a new home console. They also recognized a failure to manage their game release schedule, and to garner significant support from third-party publishers and developers, leaving the Wii U library with gaps in software releases. Nintendo stated an expectation to sell 100 million Wii U units, and this over-estimation of sales contributed to several financial quarters of losses through 2016. The development and marketing of Nintendo's next console, the Switch, was intended to avoid several of the pitfalls that occurred for the Wii U; with the change in approach, the Switch outsold the lifetime sales of the Wii U within nine months of its release. The Wii U was discontinued in January 2017.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of software that have been deemed commercial failures by industry sources.\n\n\"\" was a multiplayer online game developed by Realtime Worlds in 2010. The game, incorporating concepts from their previous game \"Crackdown\" and past work by its lead developer David Jones, who had helped create the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, was set around the idea of a large-scale urban battle between Enforcers and Criminals; players would be able to partake in large-scale on-going missions between the two sides. The game was originally set as both a Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 title and as Realtime Worlds' flagship title for release in 2008, but instead the company set about developing \"Crackdown\" first, and later focused \"APB\" as a Windows-only title, potentially porting the game to the Xbox 360 later. Upon launch in June 2010, the game received lukewarm reviews, hampered by the existence of a week-long review embargo, and did not attract the expected number of subscribers to maintain its business model. Realtime Worlds, suffering from the commercial failure of the game, sold off a second project, Project MyWorld, and subsequently reduced its operations to administration and a skeleton crew to manage the \"APB\" servers while they attempted to find a buyer, including possibly Epic Games who had expressed interest in the title. However, without any acceptable offers, the company was forced to shut down \"APB\" in September 2010. Eventually, the game was sold to K2 Network, a company that has brought other Asian massive-multiplayer online games to the Western markets as free-to-play titles, and similar changes occurred to \"APB\" when it was relaunched by K2.\n\nOne of the most notorious PC video game failures, \"Battlecruiser 3000AD\" (shortened \"BC3K\") was hyped for almost a decade before its disastrous release in the U.S. and Europe. The game was the brainchild of Derek Smart, an independent game developer renowned for lengthy and aggressive online responses to perceived criticism. The concept behind \"BC3K\" was ambitious, giving the player the command of a large starship with all the requisite duties, including navigation, combat, resource management, and commanding crew members. Advertisements appeared in the video game press in the mid-1990s hyping the game as, \"The Last Thing You'll Ever Desire.\" Computer bulletin boards and Usenet groups were abuzz with discussion about the game. As time wore on and numerous delays were announced, excitement turned to frustration in the online community. Smart exacerbated the negative air by posting liberally on Usenet. The posts ignited one of the largest flame wars in Usenet history. During the development cycle, Smart refused to let other programmers have full access to his code and continued to change directions as new technology became available, causing the game to be in development for over seven years.\n\nIn November 1996, Take-Two Interactive finally released the game, reportedly over protests from Smart. The game was buggy and only partially finished, with outdated graphics, MIDI music, a cryptic interface, and almost no documentation. Critics and the video game community reacted poorly to the release. Eventually, a stable, playable version of the game was released as \"Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0\". Smart eventually released \"BC3K\" as freeware and went on to create several sequels under the \"Battlecruiser\" and \"Universal Combat\" titles. \n\nAlthough critically acclaimed and planned as the first part of a trilogy, \"Beyond Good & Evil\" (released in 2003) flopped commercially. Former Ubisoft employee Owen Hughes stated that it was felt that the simultaneous releases of internationally competing titles \"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell\" and \"\" and in Europe, \"XIII\" (all three published by Ubisoft and all of which had strong brand identity in their markets), made an impact on \"Beyond Good & Evil\"s ability to achieve interest with the public. The game's commercial failure led Ubisoft to postpone plans for any subsequent titles in the series. A sequel was announced at the end of the Ubidays 2008 opening conference, and an HD version of the original was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 via download in 2011. Alain Corre, Ubisoft's Executive Director of EMEA Territories, commented that the Xbox 360 release \"did extremely well\", but considered this success \"too late\" to make a difference in the game's poor sales. \"Beyond Good & Evil 2\" was announced at Ubisoft's press conference at E3 2017, fourteen years after the release of the original game.\n\n\"Brütal Legend\" is Double Fine Productions' second major game. The game is set in a world based on heavy metal music, includes a hundred-song soundtrack across numerous metal subgenres, and incorporates a celebrity voice cast including Jack Black, Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Ozzy Osbourne, Lita Ford, and Tim Curry. The game was originally to be published by Vivendi Games via Sierra Entertainment prior to its merger with Activision. Following the merger, Activision declined to publish \"Brütal Legend\", and Double Fine turned to Electronic Arts as their publishing partner, delaying the game's release. Activision and Double Fine counter-sued each other for breach of contract, ultimately settling out of court. The game was designed as an action adventure/real-time strategy game similar to \"Herzog Zwei\"; as games in the real-time strategy genre generally do not perform well on consoles, Double Fine was told by both Vivendi and Electronic Arts to avoid stating this fact and emphasize other elements of the game. With some positive reviews from critics, the game got criticized for its real-time strategy elements that were not mentioned within the pre-release marketing, making it a difficult game to sell to players. Furthermore, its late-year release in October 2009 buried the title among many top-tier games, including \"Uncharted 2\", \"\" and \"\". It only sold about 215,000 units within the first month, making it a \"retail failure\", and though Double Fine had begun work on a sequel, Electronic Arts cancelled further development. According to Tim Schafer, president and lead developer of Double Fine, 1.4 million copies of the game had been sold by February 2011.\n\n\"Conker's Bad Fur Day\" is a 3D platformer by Rare for the Nintendo 64. In it, the player controls Conker, a greedy, hard-drinking squirrel, through levels. While it is visually similar to Rare's previous games like \"Banjo-Kazooie\" and \"Donkey Kong 64\", \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\" is aimed at mature audiences and features profanity, graphic violence, and off-color humor. The game was originally designed to be family-friendly, but was retooled after prerelease versions of the game were criticized for their similarities to Rare's previous games. Though receiving critical acclaim, \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\" performed well below expectations, with only 55,000 copies sold by April 2001. Numerous reasons have been cited for the game's perceived failure to connect with audiences, such as its high cost, advertisements exclusive to the older audience, and its release towards the end of the Nintendo 64's life cycle. Nintendo, which held a minority stake in Rare at the time, also did not actively promote the game.\n\nOne of the more infamous failures in modern PC video games was \"Daikatana\", which was drastically hyped due to creator John Romero's popular status as one of the key designers behind \"Doom\". However, after being wrought with massive over-spending and serious delays, the game finally launched to incredibly poor critical reaction because of bugs, lackluster enemies, poor gameplay, and terrible production values, all of which were made worse by its heavy marketing campaign proclaiming it as the next \"big thing\" in first person shooters.\n\nThe first title released by Ion Storm, \"Dominion\" was a real time strategy title similar to \"Command & Conquer\" and \"Warcraft\", based as a spin-off to the \"G-Nome\" canon. The game was originally developed by 7th Level, but was purchased by Ion Storm for US$1.8 million. The project originally had a budget of US$50,000 and was scheduled to be finished in three months with two staff members. Due to mismanagement and Ion Storm's inexperience, the project took over a year, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. \"Dominion\" was released in July 1998. It received bad reviews and sold poorly, falling far short of recouping its purchase price, let alone the cost of finishing it. The game divided employees working on Ion's marquee title, \"Daikatana\", arguably leading to the walkout of several key development team members. It put a strain on Ion Storm's finances, leading the once well-funded startup to scramble for cash as \"Daikatana\"'s development extended over several years.\n\n\"Duke Nukem Forever\" was an entry in the successful \"Duke Nukem\" series, initially announced in 1997, but spent fifteen years in development, and was frequently listed as a piece of vaporware video game software. The initial development with the Quake II Engine began in 1996, and the final game was developed by Gearbox Software, developers of the \"Borderlands\" series, and released in 2011. The game was heavily criticized and was named by several sites as their \"most disappointing\" game for the year. Because of its tangled development process, it is very hard to know which companies made and which lost money over the game. According to Gearbox head Randy Pitchford, the game cost 3D Realms head George Broussard US$20–30 million of his own money. The sales were poorer than expected, causing Take-Two to reduce their profit estimate for the quarter, though later in 2011 stated that \"Duke Nukem Forever\" would prove to be profitable for the company.\n\n\"EarthBound\" (1994), the second installment in Nintendo's \"Mother\" series of Japanese role-playing games, was released in North America in June 1995. Although Nintendo spent a sizable 2 million on marketing, it sold poorly—around 140,000 copies, as compared to twice as many in Japan. Journalists generally blame \"EarthBound\" failure to connect with American audiences on its atypical marketing campaign, which sardonically proclaimed \"this game stinks\" in reference to foul-smelling scratch and sniff advertisements. The game's poor sales have also been attributed to its simple, cartoonish graphics, the unpopularity of role-playing games at the time, and its high market price. Marcus Lindblom and his team, who translated \"EarthBound\" for America, were devastated by the poor sales. As a result, \"EarthBound\" sequel \"Mother 3\" (2006) never received an American localization on the basis it would not sell.\n\nA sequel to the successful Wii-exclusive platformer \"Epic Mickey\", \"Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two\" was developed by Junction Point Studios and published by Disney Interactive Studios for the Wii, Wii U, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Microsoft Windows. Though heavily advertised and being released on multiple consoles, only 270,000 copies of \"Epic Mickey 2\" were sold in North America, barely a quarter of the original's sales of 1.3 million. The game's failure led to the shutdown of Junction Point and the cancellation of future entries in the \"Epic Mickey\" series.\n\nBased on Steven Spielberg's popular 1982 movie of the same name and reportedly coded in just five weeks, this Atari 2600 game was rushed to the market for the 1982 holiday season.\n\nEven with 1.5 million copies sold, the sales figures came nowhere near Atari's expectations, as it had ordered production of five million copies, with many of the sold games being returned to Atari for refunds by dissatisfied consumers. It had become an urban legend that Atari had buried the unsold cartridges of \"E.T.\" and other games in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico, which was confirmed in 2014 when the site was allowed to be excavated, with former Atari personnel affirming they had dumped about 800,000 cartridges, including \"E.T.\" and other poorly-selling (and best-selling) games. The financial figures and business tactics surrounding this product are emblematic of the video game crash of 1983 and contributed to Atari's bankruptcy. Atari paid $25 million for the license to produce the game, which further contributed to a debt of $536 million (equivalent to $ billion today). The company was divided and sold in 1984.\n\nKnown for being the first adventure game by LucasArts to use three-dimensional graphics, \"Grim Fandango\" received positive reviews and won numerous awards. It was originally thought that the game sold well during the 1998 holiday season. However, the game's sales appeared to be crowded out by other titles released during the late 1998 season, including \"Half-Life\", \"Metal Gear Solid\" and \"\". Based on data provided by PC Data (now owned by NPD Group), the game sold about 95,000 copies up to 2003 in North America, excluding online sales. Worldwide sales are estimated between 100,000 and 500,000 units by 2012. Developer Tim Schafer along with others of the \"Grim Fandango\" development team would leave LucasArts after this project to begin a new studio (Double Fine Productions). \"Grim Fandango\"s relatively modest sales are often cited as a contributing factor to the decline of the adventure game genre in the late 1990s, though the title's reputation as a \"flop\" is to an extent a case of perception over reality, as Schafer has pointed out that the game turned a profit, with the royalty check he eventually received being proof. His perspective is that the adventure genre did not so much lose its audience as fail to grow it while production costs continued to rise. This made adventure games less attractive an investment for publishers; in contrast, the success of first-person shooters caused the console market to boom. The emergence of new distribution channels that did not rely on the traditional retail model would ultimately re-empower the niche genre. Double Fine has since remastered the game for high definition graphics and re-released it through these channels.\n\nAlthough reviews for \"Jazz Jackrabbit 2\" were positive, sales were insufficient and resulted in a loss for its publisher Gathering of Developers. This prevented the developers from finding a publisher, thus leading to the cancelation of \"Jazz Jackrabbit 3\" which could have been the franchise's first 3D game.\n\n\"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning\" is an action RPG game released in 2012, developed by 38 Studios and Big Huge Games. 38 Studios had been formed by Curt Schilling initially in Massachusetts. After acquiring Big Huge Games from the failing THQ, the studio secured a loan guarantee from the economic development board of Rhode Island for establishing 38 Studios within the state and promoting job growth. \"Kingdoms\" was generally well-received by critics, and initial sales within the first three months were around 1.3 million. Though impressive, Rhode Island recognized that the title was expected to have hit 3 million units by this point for 38 Studios to pay back the loan. 38 Studios defaulted on one of the loan repayments, leading to a publisher to pull out of a investment in a sequel. The studio managed to make the next payment, but could not make payroll or other expenses, and shortly later declared bankruptcy by May 2012. Resolving the unpaid loan became a civil lawsuit, and ultimately with the state settling with Schilling and other investors for a payment, leaving the state around short on its loan. The rights to \"Kingdoms\" eventually fell to THQ Nordic AB, the holding company that came to acquire many of the former THQ properties after their bankruptcy.\n\nReleased in 1997 after five years in development, this $6 million adventure game was the brainchild of Jordan Mechner, the creator of \"Prince of Persia\". The game was noted for taking place in almost complete real-time, using Art Nouveau-style characters that were rotoscoped from a 22-day live-action video shoot, and featuring intelligent writing and levels of character depth that were not often seen in computer games. Even with rave reviews, Brøderbund, the game's publisher, did little to promote the game, apart from a brief mention in a press release and enthusiastic statements by Brøderbund executives, in part due to the entire Brøderbund marketing team quitting in the weeks before its release. Released in April, the game was not a success, selling only about 100,000 copies, a million copies short of breaking even.\n\nAfter the release of the game, Mechner's company Smoking Car Productions quietly folded, and Brøderbund was acquired by The Learning Company, who were only interested in Brøderbund's educational software, effectively putting the game out of print which also caused the PlayStation port to be cancelled after almost being finished for a 1998 release. Mechner was later able to reacquire the rights to the game, and in 2012, worked with DotEmu to release an iOS port of the title, before making it to Android as well.\n\n\"MadWorld\" is a beat 'em up title for the Wii developed by PlatinumGames and distributed by Sega in March 2009. The game was purposely designed as an extremely violent video game. The game features a distinctive black-and-white graphic style that borrows from both Frank Miller's \"Sin City\" and other Japanese and Western comics. This monotone coloring is only broken by blood that comes from attacking and killing foes in numerous, gruesome, and over-the-top manners. Though there had been violent games available for the Wii from the day it was launched (e.g. \"Red Steel\"), many perceived \"MadWorld\" as one of the first mature titles for the system, causing some initial outrage from concerned consumers about the normally family-friendly system. \"MadWorld\" was well received by critics, but this did not translate into commercial sales; only 123,000 units of the game sold in the United States during its first six months on the market. Sega considered these sales to be \"disappointing\". Regardless, the game's critical success allowed a pseudo-sequel, \"Anarchy Reigns\", to be produced.\n\n\"Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite\" is the sixth main installment in Capcom's \"Marvel vs. Capcom\" series of fighting games that pits Capcom and Marvel's famous characters against each other. When the game was shown at E3 2017, some of the character designs were poorly received, particularly Chun-Li from \"Street Fighter\" and Dante from \"Devil May Cry\". The game was also criticized for its lack of X-Men or Fantastic Four characters. Capcom projected that the game would sell two million units by December 31, 2017, but the game launched with a poor showing thanks to the game having a low-budget, which would cause \"Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite\" to generate only half of the projected amount that Capcom gave. \"Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite\"s failing would lead to cancellation of DLC, and its exclusion from tournaments such as Evo 2018, as well as Capcom being quiet surrounding the title. The title's failure was also in part due to the competition it received from Bandai Namco's \"Dragon Ball FighterZ\" which along with its massive name recognition, took influence from Infinite's predecessors.\n\n\"Ōkami\" was a product of Clover Studio with direction by Hideki Kamiya, previously known for his work on the \"Resident Evil\" and \"Devil May Cry\" series. The game is favorably compared to a \"Zelda\"-type adventure, and is based on the quest of the goddess-wolf Amaterasu using a \"celestial brush\" to draw in magical effects on screen and to restore the cursed land of ancient Nippon. Released first in 2006 on the PlayStation 2, it later received a port to the Wii system, where the brush controls were reworked for the motion controls of the Wii Remote. The game was well received by critics, with Metacritic aggregate scores of 93% and 90% for the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, respectively, and was considered one of the best titles for 2006; IGN named it their Game of the Year. Though strongly praised by critics, fewer than 600,000 units were sold by March 2009. These factors have led for \"Ōkami\" to be called the \"least commercially successful winner of a game of the year award\" in the 2010 version of the \"Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition\". Shortly after its release, Capcom disbanded Clover Studio, though many of its employees went on to form PlatinumGames and produce \"MadWorld\" and the more successful \"Bayonetta\". Strong fan support of the game led to a sequel, \"Ōkamiden\", on the Nintendo DS, a high-definition remake for the PlayStation 3, and a remaster for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows.\n\nStarbreeze Studios had acquired a license in 2014 to develop a game set in \"The Walking Dead\" franchise from Skybound Entertainment, using the cooperative gameplay mechanics from \"\" developed by Starbreeze's subsidiary Overkill Software. The game fell into development hell namely due to demands from Starbreeze to switch game engines, first from the internally-developed Diesel Engine which had been used on the \"Payday\" games to the newly developed Valhalla Engine, which Starbreeze had acquired at a large cost, and later to the Unreal Engine after the Valhalla proved too difficult to work with. Having slipped its major release dates twice, the game was completed by November 2018, but which the developers felt was under extreme rush and without sufficient quality review and testing. \"Overkill's The Walking Dead\" had mediocre reviews on release to Microsoft Windows, and only 100,000 units were sold within the month. Starbreeze had placed a significant amount of sales expectations behind the game, and with poor sales, the company placed plans to release the game on consoles on hold, and in December 2018 announced that it was restructuring due to a lack of liquidatable assets from the underperformance of \"Overkill's The Walking Dead\". In Starbreeze's financial report for the quarter ending December 31, 2018, which included \"Overkill's The Walking Dead\" release, the game brought in only about (about ), while \"Payday 2\", a title released in 2013, made in the same quarter. By the end of February 2019, Skybound pulled its licensing agreement from Starbreeze as \"ultimately 'Overkill's The Walking Dead' did not meet our standards nor is it the quality that we were promised\". Starbreeze officially halted further development of the Windows version and cancelled the game's planned console ports, while Skybound later cancelled the game entirely and pulled the license from Starbreeze. The poor returns on \"OTWD\" led Starbreeze to undergo a corporate restructuring from December 2018 to December 2019, laying off staff, selling off publishing and intellectual property rights, and reimplemented paid downloadable content for \"Payday 2\", reneging on an early promise that all such future content would be free.\n\n The home version of the highly popular \"Pac-Man\" arcade game was eagerly anticipated, but was a commercial disappointment for Atari though being a best-selling game. The game was rushed to make the 1981 Christmas season. In 1982, Atari created 12 million cartridges, even though there were only 10 million Atari 2600s sold at the time, in hopes of the game boosting system sales. \"Pac-Man\" did sell close to seven million cartridges, but consumers and critics alike gave it low ratings. The high number of unsold units (over five million), coupled with the expense of a large marketing campaign, led to large losses for Atari. This game and \"E.T.\" are often blamed for sparking the video game crash of 1983, though other factors related to the state of the industry contributed to the crash. Shortly after the disappointment of \"Pac-Man\", Atari reported a huge quarterly loss, prompting parent company Warner Communications to sell the division off in 1984. Atari never regained a prominent position in the home console market.\n\nThough achieving notable critical success, including GameSpot's 2005 \"Best Game No One Played\" award, \"Psychonauts\" sold fewer than 100,000 copies during its initial release. The game led to troubles at publisher Majesco Entertainment, including the resignation of its CEO and the plummeting of the company's stock, prompting a class-action lawsuit by the company's stockholders. At the time of its release in 2005, the game was considered the \"poster child\" for failures in innovative games. Its poor sales have also been blamed on a lack of marketing. However, today the game remains a popular title on various digital download services. The creator of \"Psychonauts\", Tim Schafer, has a cult following due to his unique and eccentric style. Eventually, Double Fine would go on to acquire the full rights to publishing the game, and, with funding from Dracogen, created a Mac OS X and Linux port of the game, which was sold as part of a Humble Bundle in 2012 with nearly 600,000 bundles sold; according to Schafer, \"We made more on \"Psychonauts\" [in 2012] than we ever have before.\" In August 2015, Steam Spy estimated approximately 1,157,000 owners of the game on the digital distributor Steam. \"Psychonauts\" was re-released in 2019 for the Playstation 4 as a Standard Edition and a Collector's Edition, both region free, by publishing company Limited Run Games.\n\n\"Shenmue\" on the Dreamcast is more notorious for its overambitious budget than its poor sales figures. At the time of release in 1999, the game had the record for the most expensive production costs (over US$70 million), and its five-year production time. In comparison, the games' total sale was 1.2 million copies. \"Shenmue\", however, was a critical hit, earning an average review score of 89%. The game was supposed to be the initial installment of a trilogy. The second installment was eventually released in 2001, but by this time the Dreamcast was floundering, so the game only saw a release in Japan and Europe. Sega eventually released it for North American players for the Xbox, but the poor performance of both titles combined with restructuring have made Sega reluctant to complete the trilogy for fear of failure to return on the investment. However, a Kickstarter campaign has received record support for a third title, with a release originally set for 2018, was eventually released on November 19, 2019. Ports of the first two titles were released in 2018 for PC and PlayStation 4 to re-acclimate players in preparation for the third title's release.\n\n\"Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric\" is a spin-off from the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series, released in 2014 and developed by Big Red Button Entertainment and IllFonic for Sega and Sonic Team, along with its handheld counterpart \"\", which was developed by Sanzaru Games. Although both games received a negative reception, \"Rise of Lyric\" for the Wii U is particularly considered one of the worst video games of all time due to many glitches, poor gameplay and weak writing. Both games failed commercially, selling only 490,000 copies as of February 2015, making them the lowest-selling games in the \"Sonic\" franchise.\n\n\"Sonic Runners\" was a \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" game for Android and iOS. A side-scrolling endless runner, it was Sonic Team's first \"Sonic\" game that was exclusive to smartphones. It was soft launched in select regions in February 2015 and officially released worldwide in June 2015 to mixed reviews. Although it was downloaded over five million times, the game's publisher, Sega, considered it a commercial failure because it only made between ¥30–50 million a month. As a result, it was discontinued in July 2016. \"Nintendo Life\" wrote its failure was proof that the recognizability of a brand does not guarantee success.\n\n\"Sunset\", a first-person exploration adventure game involving a housekeeper working for a dictator of a fictional country, was developed by two-person Belgian studio Tale of Tales, who previously had created several acclaimed arthouse style games and other audio-visual projects such as \"The Path\". They wanted to make \"Sunset\" a \"game for gamers\" while still retaining their arthouse-style approach, and in addition to planning on a commercial release, used Kickstarter to gain funding. \"Sunset\" only sold about 4000 copies on its release, including those to Kickstarter backers. Tale of Tales opted to close their studio after sinking the company's finances into the game, and believed that if they did release any new games in the future, they would likely shy away from commercial release.\n\nThe fourth game in the popular \"Myst\" series, released in 2003. It was developed by Cyan Worlds shortly after \"Riven\" was completed. The game took Cyan Worlds more than five years and $12 million to complete and was codenamed DIRT (\"D'ni in real time\"), then MUDPIE (meaning \"Multi-User DIRT, Persistent / Personal Interactive Entertainment / Experience / Exploration / Environment\"). Though it had generally positive reception, the sales were disappointing. In comparison, the first three \"Myst\" games had sold more than 12 million units collectively before \"Uru\"s release. \"Uru\"s poor sales were also considered a factor in financially burdening Cyan, contributing to the company's near closure in 2005.\n\nReleased by Atari in 1983, \"I, Robot\" was the first video game to use 3-D polygon graphics, and the first that allowed the player to change camera angles. It also had gameplay that rewarded planning and stealth as much as reflexes and trigger speed, and included a non-game mode called \"Doodle City,\" where players could make artwork using the polygons. Production estimates vary, but all agree that there were no more than 1500 units made.\n\nIn 1982, the President of Cinematronics arranged a one-time purchase of 5000 printed circuit boards from Japan. The boards were used in the manufacture of several games, but the majority of them were reserved for the new arcade game \"Jack the Giantkiller\", based on the classic fairy tale \"Jack and the Beanstalk\". Between the purchase price of the boards and other expenses, Cinematronics invested almost two million dollars into \"Jack the Giantkiller\". It completely flopped in the arcade and many of the boards went unsold, costing the company a huge amount of money at a time when it was already having financial difficulties.\n\n\"Radar Scope\" was one of the first arcade games released by Nintendo. It was released in Japan first, and a brief run of success there led Nintendo to order 3,000 units for the American market in 1980. American operators were unimpressed, however, and Nintendo of America was stuck with about 2,000 unsold \"Radar Scope\" machines sitting in the warehouse.\n\nFacing a potential financial disaster, Nintendo assigned the game's designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, to revamp the game. Instead he designed a brand new game that could be run in the same cabinets and on the same hardware as \"Radar Scope\". That new game was the smash hit \"Donkey Kong\", and Nintendo was able to recoup its investment in 1981 by converting the remaining unsold \"Radar Scope\" units to \"Donkey Kong\" and selling those.\n\n\"Sundance\" was an arcade vector game released in 1979. Producer Cinematronics planned to manufacture about 1000 \"Sundance\" units, but sales suffered from a combination of poor gameplay and an abnormally high rate of manufacturing defects. The fallout rate in production was about 50%, the vector monitor (made by an outside vendor) had a defective picture tube that would arc and burn out if the game was left in certain positions during shipping, and according to programmer Tim Skelly, the circuit boards required a lot of cut-and-jumpering between mother and daughter boards that also made for a very fragile setup. The units that survived to reach arcade floors were not a hit with gamers—Skelly himself reportedly felt that the gameplay lacked the \"anxiety element\" necessary in a good game and asked Cinematronics not to release it, and in an April 1983 interview with \"Video Games\" Magazine he referred to \"Sundance\" as \"a total dog\".\n\n\n"}

He returned to Bread Loaf for a second summer in 1966. Wolfe was a MacDowell Colony resident in poetry in 1968. He received an Amy Lowell Traveling Poets Scholarship in 1970, which was renewed for two further years. During this time he traveled and wrote in North and West Africa. His first books of poetry \"How Love Gets Around\" and \"World Your Own,\" a book of fiction \"Invisible Weapons,\" and a travel journal \"In Morocco\" derive from this period. In the 1980s, he returned to North Africa several more times. As a Muslim he performed the pilgrimage to Mecca in 1990 and wrote extensively about it.\n\nWolfe's first works on Islam were a pair of books from Grove Press on the pilgrimage to Mecca: \"The Hadj\" (1993; 2015), a first-person travel account, and \"One Thousand Roads to Mecca\" (1997; updated & expanded, 2015), an anthology of 10 centuries of travelers writing about the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. Shortly after 11 September 2001, he edited a collection of essays by American Muslims and others called \"Taking Back Islam: American Muslims Reclaim Their Faith\". \"Taking Back Islam\" won the 2003 annual Wilbur Award for \"Best Book of the year on a Religious Theme\". In 2010, Wolfe was included in \"The 500 Most Influential Muslims,\" (Third Edition).\n\nIn 2010, Blue Press Books published a chapbook of poems by Wolfe entitled \"Paradise: Reading Notes\". In 2012, Blue Press published a second chapbook, entitled \"Greek to Me.\" In 2014, Blue Press issued a third chapbook, \"Tarantella.\" In 2014, he also assembled a fourth, longer volume of poetry, entitled \" Digging Up Russia: Selected Poems, 1968-2010.\" Between 2008 and 2012, Wolfe translated a collection of 127 epitaphs from the Greek Anthology, entitled \"Cut These Words into My Stone: Selected Ancient Greek Epitaphs.\" This collection with a set of brief contextualizing essays was published by Johns Hopkins University Press in 2013, with an Introduction by Professor Richard P. Martin, Chair of the Stanford University Classics Department. The book was well received in classical journals and among poets. It was short-listed for PEN's Best Book of Poetry in Translation. \n\nIn 2014 Wolfe completed a brief, first-person novel, entitled \"The Motorbike,\" set in Cincinnati in 1958. In 2017, he began researching and writing a nonfiction book, \"My Mother's People,\" about his colonial Yankee ancestry and modern American immigration.\n\nFor about four years, Wolfe wrote an occasional column for Beliefnet, a Web journal of the world’s religions.\n\nIn April 1997, Wolfe hosted a televised account of the Hajj, broadcast from Mecca for Ted Koppel's \"Nightline\" on ABC. The program was nominated for Peabody, Emmy, George Polk, and National Press Club Awards. It won the annual Media Award from the Muslim Public Affairs Council. In February 2003, Wolfe worked with CNN International television news reporter Zain Verjee to produce a new half-hour documentary on the Hajj. Wolfe has been featured on hundreds of regional and national radio talk shows.\n\nIn 1999, Wolfe helped found an educational media foundation focused on promoting peace through the media, Unity Productions Foundation (UPF). In 2002, UPF produced its first full-length film, called \"\", a two-hour television documentary on the life and times of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The film, which Wolfe co-created and co-produced, received a national broadcast on PBS and subsequent international broadcasts on National Geographic International.

It consists of an area including Upper Darby Township, Clifton Heights borough, and Millbourne borough. According to 2009 local census data, it serves a resident population of 90,000. In 2009, the district residents’ per capita income was $20,699, while the median family income was $51,965. In the Commonwealth, the median family income was $49,501 and the United States median family income was $49,445, in 2010. According to District officials, in school year 2007–08, Upper Darby School District provided basic educational services to 11,700 pupils.\n\nUpper Darby schools serve an increasingly diverse population: 41% of students are White, 42% are African American, 13% are Asian/Pacific Islander, 3% are Hispanic and 1% are other. In 2010, there are 877 Limited English Proficient (LEP) students speaking over 70 languages, including Punjabi, Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, Albanian, Greek, and Urdu. Over 350 students also meet the state criteria for immigrant status. In addition, the district annually educates more than 380 students who have refugee status and/or limited formal schooling. In the past seven years, the percentage of students who meet the low-income status set by the Federal Free/Reduced Lunch Program has risen from 23% to almost 50%.\n\nIn 2010, the District employed: 960 teachers, 237 full-time and part-time support personnel, and 46 administrators. Upper Darby School District received more than $45.4 million in state funding in school year 2007–08.\n\nUpper Darby School District operates one high school, two middle schools, ten elementary schools, one kindergarten center, and a cyber academy.\n\n\n\nThe school district is governed by 9 individually elected board members (serve four-year terms), the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania General Assembly. The federal government controls programs it funds like Title I funding for low-income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, which mandates the district focus resources on student success in acquiring on grade level reading and math skills.\n\nIn July 2012, the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) released a report identifying three Upper Darby School District schools as among the lowest-achieving schools for the number of students who are on grade level in reading and mathematics in 2011. Bywood Elementary School, Charles Kelly Elementary School and Stonehurst Elementary School are all three listed as in the bottom 15% lowest-achieving schools in the Commonwealth. Parents and students may be eligible for scholarships to transfer to another public or nonpublic school through the state's Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program passed in June 2012. The scholarships are limited to those students whose family's income is less than $60,000 annually, with another $12,000 allowed per dependent. Maximum scholarship award is $8,500, with special education students receiving up to $15,000 for a year's tuition. Parents pay any difference between the scholarship amount and the receiving school's tuition rate. Students may seek admission to neighboring public school districts. Each year the PDE publishes the tuition rate for each individual public school district. Fifty three public schools in Allegheny County are among the lowest-achieving schools in 2011. According to the report, parents in 414 public schools (74 school districts) were offered access to these scholarships. For the 2012–13 school year, eight public school districts in Pennsylvania had all of their schools placed on the list, including: Sto-Rox School District, Chester Upland School District, Clairton City School District, Duquesne City School District, Farrell Area School District, Wilkinsburg Borough School District, William Penn School District and Steelton-Highspire School District. Funding for the scholarships comes from donations by businesses which receive a state tax credit for donating.\n\nUpper Darby School District was ranked 448th out of 498 Pennsylvania school districts by the Pittsburgh Business Times in 2012. The ranking was based on student academic achievement as demonstrated on the last three years of the PSSAs for: reading, writing math and science. The PSSAs are given to all children in grades 3rd through 8th and the 11th grade in high school. Adapted examinations are given to children in the special education programs. In 2012, Upper Darby School District ranked 11th out of the 15 public school districts operating in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, with Radnor Township School District ranking highest in student academic achievement.\n\n\nIn 2012, the Pittsburgh Business Times also reported an Overachievers Ranking for 498 Pennsylvania school districts. Upper Darby School District ranked 442nd. In 2011, the district was 406th. The editor describes the ranking as: \"a ranking answers the question - which school districts do better than expectations based upon economics? This rank takes the Honor Roll rank and adds the percentage of students in the district eligible for free and reduced-price lunch into the formula. A district finishing high on this rank is smashing expectations, and any district above the median point is exceeding expectations.\" Among Delaware County public schools, Upper Darby SD ranked 13th out of 15 districts with Radnor Township School District ranking first.\n\nIn 2011, Upper Darby School District declined to Warning status due to lagging student academic achievement in both reading and mathematics. In 2011, 94 percent of the 500 Pennsylvania public school districts achieved the No Child Left Behind Act progress level of 72% of students reading on grade level and 67% of students demonstrating on grade level math. In 2011, 46.9 percent of Pennsylvania school districts achieved Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) based on student performance. An additional 37.8 percent of school districts made AYP based on a calculated method called safe harbor, 8.2 percent on the growth model and 0.8 percent on a two-year average performance.\n\nIn 2011, Upper Darby School District's graduation rate was 92%. In 2010, the Pennsylvania Department of Education issued a new, 4-year cohort graduation rate. Upper Darby Senior High School's rate was 80.99% for 2010.\n\n\nUpper Darby Senior High School is located at 601 North Lansdowne Avenue, Drexel Hill. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2010, the school reported an enrollment of 3,762 pupils in grades 9th through 12th, with 1408 pupils eligible for a federal free or reduced-price lunch. The school employed 257 teachers, yielding a student–teacher ratio of 14:1. According to a report by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 4 teachers were rated \"Non‐Highly Qualified\" under No Child Left Behind. Upper Darby Senior High School is one of the largest high schools in Pennsylvania by enrollment. The High School is also home to the Upper Darby Performing Arts Center, and the Summer Stage program.\n\nIn 2011, Upper Darby Senior High School declined to Corrective Action II 5th Year AYP status due to poor achievement in reading and mathematics. The school met just one metric. Under the federal No Child Left Behind Act, the school administration was required to notify parents of the school's poor achievement outcomes and to offer the parents the opportunity to transfer their child to a successful school within the District. Additionally, the school administration was required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, to develop a School Improvement Plan to address the school's low student achievement. Under the Pennsylvania Accountability System, the school must pay for additional tutoring for struggling students.\n\n\n11th Grade Reading\n\n11th Grade Math:\n\n11th Grade Science:\n\nAccording to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 59% of the Upper Darby Senior High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.\n\nUpper Darby Senior High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions.\n\nFor the 2009–10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $5,023 for the program.\n\nFrom January to June 2011, 581 Upper Darby School District students took the SAT exams. The district's Verbal Average Score was 440. The Math average score was 464. The Writing average score was 423. Pennsylvania ranked 40th among states with SAT scores: Verbal - 493, Math - 501, Writing - 479. In the United States, 1.65 million students took the exam in 2011. They averaged 497 (out of 800) verbal, 514 math and 489 in writing.\n\nUpper Darby School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 135 credits to graduate, including: a required class every year in Mathematics, English, Social Studies, Science, Physical Education 4 years, Computer Course 1 and electives. Core academic courses are worth 5 credits each and AP courses are worth 7.5 credits.\n\nBy law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district.\n\nBy Pennsylvania School Board regulations, for the graduating class of 2017, students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, English Composition, and Literature for which the Keystone Exams serve as the final course exams. Students’ Keystone Exam scores shall count for at least one-third of the final course grade. In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.\n\nBeverly Hills Middle School is located at 1400 Garrett Road, Upper Darby. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2010, the school reported an enrollment of 1,456 pupils in grades 6th through 8th, with 877 pupils receiving a federal free or reduced-price lunch due to family poverty. The school employed 104.5 teachers, yielding a student–teacher ratio of 14:1.

The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years.

According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval.\n\nAt Upper Darby School District nutrition education is provided within the sequential, comprehensive health education program, in accordance with State Board of Education curriculum regulations and the academic standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, and Family and Consumer Sciences mandated by the Commonwealth.

The District received $102,640.\n\nIn 2010, Pennsylvania received $141 million from the federal –US Department of Education, to turn around its worst-performing schools. The funds were disbursed via a competitive grant program. The Pennsylvania Department of Education has identified 200 Pennsylvania schools as \"persistently lowest-achieving,\" making them eligible for this special funding. Pennsylvania required low performing schools to apply or provide documentation about why they had not applied. The funds must be used, by the district, to turn around schools in one of four ways: school closure, restart - close the school and reopen it as a charter school. The other two options involve firing the principal. One would require at least half the faculty in a chronically poor performing school be dismissed. The second involves intensive teacher training coupled with strong curriculum revision or a longer school day.\n\nDistrict officials applied for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Due to very low student achievement the district was identified as a turnaround district making it eligible for an additional $750 per child in the district. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.\n\nIn July 2012, Upper Darby School District did not apply for a federal grant which is run by the PDE. The grant calls for the establishment and sustainability of community learning centers that provide additional educational services to students in high-poverty and low-performing schools. The grant was competitive. Applications for the grants were reviewed and scored by a panel of representatives from the educational field and professional grant writers. The school received $114,061. While 101 entities applied for the funding, only 66 were approved, including eight charter schools. The funding is for the 2012–13 fiscal year.\n\nThe Upper Darby School Board elected to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes.\n\nProperty tax rates in 2012–13 were set by the school board at 32.84 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders.\n\nThe Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011–2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the School District 2006–2007 through 2011–2012.\n\n\nFor the 2012–13 budget year, Upper Darby School Board applied for 2 exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: special education costs and teacher pension costs. For 2012–2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.\n\nFor the 2011–12 school year, the Upper Darby School Board applied for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index, including Maintenance of Local Tax Revenue, teacher pension costs and special education costs. Each year, the Upper Darby School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.\n\nAccording to a state report, for the 2011–2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.\n\nUpper Darby School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011. For 2009–10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.\n\nIn 2012, Upper Darby School District approved homestead residents received $313. In 2010, property tax relief for 16,571 approved residents of Upper Darby School District was set at $310. The highest property tax relief, among Pennsylvania school districts, went to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. Chester-Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Delaware County, 68.22% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.\n\nAdditionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. In 2012, Pennsylvania Secretary of the Treasury reported issuing more than half a million property tax rebates totaling $238 million. The program is funded by the Pennsylvania Lottery. Property tax rebates are increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.\n\nProperty taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).\n\nThe District is assigned to Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) District 1\n\nThe District funds the following sports for high school students:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2003818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003818", "title": "Dutch angle", "text": "Dutch angle\n\nThe Dutch angle, also known as Dutch tilt, canted angle, or oblique angle, is a type of camera shot which involves setting the camera at an angle on its roll axis so that the shot is composed with vertical lines at an angle to the side of the frame, or so that the horizon line of the shot is not parallel with the bottom of the camera frame. This produces a viewpoint akin to tilting one's head to the side. In cinematography, the Dutch angle is one of many cinematic techniques often used to portray psychological uneasiness or tension in the subject being filmed. \n\nThe word \"Dutch\" in this context is a bastardisation of the word \"Deutsch\", the German word for \"German\"; it is not related to the Dutch people or language. It originated in the First World War, as Navy blockades made the import (and export) of movies impossible. The German movie scene was part of the expressionist movement, which used the Dutch angle extensively.\n\nA Dutch angle is a camera shot in which the camera has been rotated relative to the horizon or vertical lines in the shot. The primary use of such angles is to cause a sense of unease or disorientation for the viewer. Many Dutch angles are static shots, but in a moving Dutch angle shot the camera can pivot, pan or track along the established diagonal axis for the shot.\n\nDziga Vertov's 1929 experimental documentary \"Man with a Movie Camera\" contains uses of the Dutch angle, among other innovative techniques discovered by Vertov himself.\n\nThe angle was widely used to depict madness, unrest, exoticism, and disorientation in German Expressionism, hence its name \"Deutsch\", meaning German, was often conflated with the etymologically similar word Dutch which gives the corruption of the term now commonly used. Montages of Dutch angles are often structured such that the tilts are horizontally opposed in each shot – for example, a right-tilted shot will be followed with a left-tilted shot, and so on.\n\nThe 1949 film \"The Third Man\" makes extensive use of Dutch angle shots, to emphasize the main character's alienation in a foreign environment. Director Carol Reed has said that William Wyler gave him a spirit level after seeing the film, to sardonically encourage him to use more traditional shooting angles.\n\nDutch angles were used extensively in the satirical 1960s \"Batman\" TV series (and its 1966 film spin-off) in which each villain had his or her own angle, as they were \"crooked\".\n\nDutch angles are frequently used by film directors who have a background in the visual arts, such as Tim Burton (in \"Edward Scissorhands\" and \"Ed Wood\"), and Terry Gilliam (in \"Brazil\", \"The Fisher King\", \"12 Monkeys\", \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" and \"Tideland\") to represent madness, disorientation, or drug psychosis. In his \"Evil Dead\" trilogy, Sam Raimi used Dutch angles to show that a character had become possessed by evil.\n\nThe Dutch angle is an overt cinematographical technique that can be overused. The science-fiction film \"Battlefield Earth\" (2000), in particular, drew sharp criticism for its pervasive use of the Dutch angle. In the words of film critic Roger Ebert, \"the director, Roger Christian, has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, but he has not learned why\".\n\nDutch angles are often used in horror video games, particularly those with static camera angles such as early entries in the \"Resident Evil\" and \"Silent Hill\" franchises. Similar to their use in movies, these angles are used to bring about a feeling of unease in the player.\n\n"}

The gang was prominent in the Fourth Ward and Corlear's Hook districts immediately after the American Civil War, until their breakup by the New York City Police Department in 1876.\n\nThe Hook Gang was formed during the mid-1860s following the American Civil War. Based from New York's Corlear's Hook waterfront on the East River, the gang numbered between 50 and 100 members including James Coffee, Terry Le Strange, Suds Merrick and Tommy Shay. The gang became known for attacking and hijacking shipping. One early robbery took place when James Coffee and Tommy Shay forced a local eight-man rowing club at gunpoint to row the boat to the Brooklyn shore. Within 50 yards of the shore, the rowing team were ordered to jump out and swim to the beach while Coffee and Shay escaped with the boat.\n\nOne gang member, Slipsey Ward, was arrested and imprisoned at Auburn Prison after attempting to hijack a schooner sailing past Pike Street, killing three of the six man crew before he was detained by the remaining crew members.\n\nThe gang's downfall occurred when a member by the name of Wallace attempted to hijack a rowboat which contained off-duty police detectives on a fishing trip. After Wallace's arrest, the idea for a Police \"Steamboat Squad\" was formed. The remaining members of the gang were arrested by police in 1876.\n\n\n"}

In 1931 she received her Ph.D. on projective geometry under the direction of Max Dehn, and in 1932 spent a fellowship year in Rome.

She was responsible for ground-breaking work on non-associative algebraic structures, including the Moufang loops named after her.\n\nIn 1933 Moufang showed Desargues's theorem does not hold in the Cayley plane. The Cayley plane uses octonion coordinates which do not satisfy the associative law. Such connections between geometry and algebra had been previously noted by Karl von Staudt and David Hilbert.

February 21, 1937, RSFSR, Soviet Union, now Russian Federation, d. December 31, 2009, Hollywood, California) was a film director, cinematographer, documentarian, essayist, photographer and artist who developed a style of documentary filmmaking termed the \"direction of undirected action.\"\n\nHe is considered an important cinematographer and documentarian of his generation, noted for artistic collaborations with Sergei Parajanov and such influential documentary films as \"\", \"The Seasons\" (directed by Artavazd Peleshyan), \"The Color of Armenian Land\", and a series of essays including \"The Unmailed Letters\".\n\nVartanov's debut film, \"The Color of Armenian Land\", marked the beginning of his trademark style, afterwards dubbed as the \"direction of undirected action.\" This documentary, a silent commentary on the technique of painter Martiros Saryan, also featured Vartanov's friends, the dissident artists Minas Avetisyan and Sergei Parajanov. Due to this the film was censored and suppressed; leading up to Avetisyan's assassination and Parajanov's imprisonment shortly after.\n\nMikhail Vartanov had a close relationship with imprisoned director Sergei Parajanov. He was first acquainted with Parajanov's work in 1964, having watched the latter's film \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\" and the test footage of the unfinished \"Kiev Frescoes\" as a student at Moscow’s Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. Their lifelong friendship began after they met for the first time in 1967, in Armenia, and discussed the screenplay of \"The Color of Pomegranates\" (also known as \"Sayat Nova\").\n\nVartanov's next film \"Autumn Pastoral\"—written by Artavazd Peleshyan and scored by composer Tigran Mansurian—was shelved. After Sergei Parajanov was arrested in Kiev in 1973, Vartanov immediately protested to the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. The recently declassified document proved that it was that letter in support of Parajanov that prompted the intensified harassment that Vartanov endured, and his subsequent firing from the Armenfilm Studios 4 months after Paradjanov's imprisonment. In a letter from prison, Parajanov wrote to Vartanov: \"You and your purity are colliding with circumstances and predators… That's life.\" \n\nPeleshyan and Gennadi Melkonian petitioned the Soviet Russian and Armenian authorities to work with Vartanov, who was by this time completely blacklisted and unemployed, and he was eventually allowed to participate as a cinematographer in two essay films: \"The Seasons\" (also translated as \"The Seasons of the Year\", 1975) and \"The Mulberry Tree\" (1979).\n\nAfter a 9-year absence from directing, Vartanov was asked to save a troubled project, \"The Roots\" (1983) which he later wrote was \"the best film made in Armenia that year.\" During this period he also worked as a university professor of cinema and photography, while publishing his writings. They appeared in several languages, including French, in \"Cahiers du cinéma\".\n\nFor over 20 years, Vartanov's films had been largely suppressed, unmentioned by press, or blocked from submission to foreign film festivals. In a letter to the imprisoned Parajanov, Vartanov wrote, quoting his favorite poet Boris Pasternak: \"the time will come and the power of meanness and malice would be overcome by the spirit of kindness.\" Parajanov responded to Vartanov: \"Dear Misha, I received your amazing letter... Never have you been more accurate in evaluating the world and expressing yourself...\".\n\nMikhail Vartanov's last documentary trilogy consisted of \"Erased Faces\" (1987), \"Minas: A Requiem\" (1989), and the influential film \"\" (1992) made in a war-torn, blockaded Armenia during the Nagorno-Karabakh War.\n\n\"In our land, the government manufactures the biography of the Artist. It honors and awards one, for nothing, and it dishonors and imprisons the other -- a wise government -- it desires to turn both into obedient slaves.\"\n\n\"Probably, besides the film language suggested by Griffith and Eisenstein, the world cinema has not discovered anything revolutionarily new until the 'Color of Pomegranates,' not counting the generally unaccepted language of the 'Andalusian Dog' by Bunuel.\"\n\n\n\nParajanov-Vartanov Institute was established in Hollywood in 2010 to study, preserve and promote the artistic legacies of Sergei Parajanov and Mikhail Vartanov.\n\n\n\n"}

Located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, Holy Angels educates more than 650 students each year in grades nine through twelve from around the Twin Cities metropolitan area.\n\nThe Academy of Holy Angels was founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet on October 2, 1877. On September 15, 1931, the newly constructed building was opened. The initial enrollment of 107 students in grades 1-12 grew to 182 by the end of the 1931–1932 school year. The original grounds included a formal English garden in the courtyard, tennis courts, a 9-hole golf course, and an ice skating rink during the winter.\n\nThe school was accredited in 1932, and that same year the school had its first graduating class of 13 members. In 1935 the Alumnae Association was established with most of its efforts directed toward communication, reunions, special events for alumni and the annual alumni phonathon. By 1943, Holy Angels had discontinued its grade school but continued to offer Kindergarten until 1946, when St. Peter's Church next door opened its parish elementary school. The 1952–1953 school year was the last year for boarders to live at Holy Angels, and 1953 marked the beginning of Holy Angels solely as a day school.\n\nIn September 1972, the Academy became a coeducational school. The class of 1976 was the first full four-year co-ed class. Because the school was now co-ed, the \"Angies\" became the \"co*Stars\" and varsity athletics began. Today the athletic program has grown to 33 teams representing 18 varsity sports for both girls and boys. In 1989 a middle school and theater school were established. In 1996, to enhance the campus and revenues, Holy Angels built the StarDome; a $2 million, year-round athletic facility (the first high school in the United States to have a facility of this type). The complex includes bleachers, a concession building and a playing field for Holy Angels sports and activities. The playing surface consists of Field Turf and features a removable dome to make the field playable during the winter months. The field is uncovered during the summer.\n\nIn 1998 Holy Angels was named a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education. That same year, the last group of 8th graders graduated middle school. The school chose to focus instead on just educating high school students. But, despite this closing, the high school was still growing, expanding their classroom space by 15%. In 2003 Holy Angels purchased the campus from its founders, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, at a substantial discount. In that same year, they built and dedicated a new addition that included a Convocation Center and classrooms.\n\nThe Academy of Holy Angels is in the Tri-Metro Conference, which is part of the Minnesota State High School League\n\nThe official mascot of Holy Angels is Shiner the Angel.\n\nIn 2005, both the boys and girls hockey teams won the state championship, the first time in Minnesota that the boys and girls hockey championships were from the same school.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2003842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003842", "title": "Appalachian Development Highway System", "text": "Appalachian Development Highway System\n\nThe Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) is part of the Appalachian Regional Commission in the United States. It consists of a series of highway corridors in the Appalachia region of the eastern United States. The routes are designed as local and regional routes for improving economic development in the historically isolated region. It was established as part of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965, and has been repeatedly supplemented by various federal and state legislative and regulatory actions. The system consists of a mixture of state, U.S., and Interstate routes. The routes are formally designated as \"corridors\" and assigned a letter. Signage of these corridors varies from place to place, but where signed are often done so with a distinctive blue-colored sign.\n\nA 2019 study found that the construction of the ADHS led to economic net gains of $54 billion (approximately 0.4 percent of national income) and boosted incomes in the Appalachian region by reducing the costs of trade.\n\n In 1964, the President's Appalachian Regional Commission (PARC) reported to Congress that economic growth in Appalachia would not be possible until the region's isolation had been overcome. Because the cost of building highways through Appalachia's mountainous terrain was high, the region's local residents had never been served by adequate roads. The existing network of narrow, winding, two-lane roads, snaking through narrow stream valleys or over mountaintops, was slow to drive, unsafe, and in many places worn out. The nation's Interstate Highway System, though extensive through the region, was designed to serve cross-country traffic rather than local residents.\n\nThe PARC report and the Appalachian governors placed top priority on a modern highway system as the key to economic development. As a result, Congress authorized the construction of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) in the Appalachian Development Act of 1965. The ADHS was designed to generate economic development in previously isolated areas, supplement the interstate system, and provide access to areas within the region as well as to markets in the rest of the nation.\n\nCurrently, the ADHS is authorized at , including added in January 2004 by Public Law 108-199. By the end of FY 2018, —approximately 90.5 percent of the authorized—were complete, open to traffic, or under construction. Many of the remaining miles will be among the most expensive to build.\n\nCorridor Z across southern Georgia is not part of the official system, but has been assigned by the Georgia Department of Transportation.\n\nCorridor A is a highway in the states of Georgia and North Carolina. It travels from Interstate 285 (I-285) north of Atlanta northeasterly to I-40 near Clyde, North Carolina. I-40 continues easterly past Asheville, where it meets I-26 and Corridor B.\n\nIn Georgia, Corridor A travels along the State Route 400 (SR 400) freeway from I-285 to the SR 141 interchange southwest of Cumming. From here to Nelson, near the north end of I-575, Corridor A has not been constructed; its proposed path is near that of the cancelled Northern Arc. It begins again with a short piece of SR 372, becoming SR 515 when it meets I-575. SR 515 is a four-lane divided highway all the way to Blairsville. From Blairsville to North Carolina, the corridor has not been built, and SR 515 is a two-lane road.\n\nThe short North Carolina Highway 69 (NC 69) takes Corridor A north to U.S. Route 64 (US 64) near Hayesville. Corridor A turns east on US 64, and after some two-lane sections, it becomes a four-lane highway. Corridor A switches to US 23 near Franklin, and meets the east end of Corridor K near Sylva. From Sylva to its end at I-40 near Clyde, Corridor A uses the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, which carries US 23 most of the way and US 74 for its entire length.\n\nCorridor A-1 uses US 19/SR 400 from the point that Corridor A leaves it, at SR 141 near Cumming, northeast to SR 53 near Bright. SR 400 continues northeast as a four-lane highway from SR 53 to SR 60 south of Dahlonega; this section was built \"with APL funds as a local access road\".\n\nCorridor B is a highway in the states of North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio. It generally follows U.S. Route 23 (US 23) from Interstate 26 (I-26) and I-40 near Asheville, North Carolina, north to Corridor C north of Portsmouth, Ohio.\n\nCorridor B uses I-240 from its south end into downtown Asheville, where it uses US 23 (current and future Interstate 26) to Kingsport, Tennessee. The US 23 freeway ends at the Tennessee–Virginia state line, but US 23 is a four-lane divided highway through Virginia and into northeastern Kentucky.\n\nAt Greysbranch, Kentucky, Corridor B leaves US 23 to turn east on Kentucky Route 10 (KY 10) over the two-lane Jesse Stuart Memorial Bridge into Ohio. The short Ohio State Route 253 (OH 253) connects the bridge to US 52, a freeway that takes Corridor B north to Wheelersburg. US 52 continues west to Portsmouth, the proposed alignment of Corridor B continues north and northwest along Ohio State Route 823 to US 23 near Lucasville. The part of Corridor B north of SR 253 is also part of the I-73/74 North–South Corridor.\n\nCorridor B-1 travels from KY 10 to the north end of the Portsmouth Bypass. In Kentucky, it follows US 23 and US 23 Truck; after crossing the two-lane Carl Perkins Bridge into Ohio, it uses current and planned SR 852—a western bypass of Portsmouth—and US 23. Corridors B and B-1 both end near Lucasville, where Corridor C continues north along US 23 to Columbus.\n\nCorridor C is a highway in the U.S. state of Ohio. It is part of U.S. Route 23 (US 23), traveling from the north end of Corridor B near Lucasville north to Interstate 270 (I-270) south of Columbus. , most of the road is a four-lane divided highway, but there are a few gaps yet to be built. Corridor C is part of the I-73/I-74 North–South Corridor.\n\nCorridor C-1 is a connector from Corridor C near Chillicothe southeast to Corridor D near Jackson, Ohio, along US 35. It has been completed as a four-lane highway.\n\nCorridor D travels east-west from Interstate 275 (I-275), near Cincinnati, Ohio, to I-79, near Bridgeport, West Virginia. The corridor utilizes Ohio State Route 32 (SR 32) and U.S. Route 50 (US 50).\nInterstate 68 (I-68) is a Interstate highway in the U.S. states of West Virginia and Maryland, connecting I-79 in Morgantown to I-70 in Hancock. I-68 is also Corridor E of the Appalachian Development Highway System. From 1965 until the freeway's construction was completed in 1991, it was designated as U.S. Route 48 (US 48). In Maryland, the highway is known as the National Freeway, an homage to the historic National Road, which I-68 parallels between Keysers Ridge and Hancock. The freeway mainly spans rural areas, and crosses numerous mountain ridges along its route. A road cut constructed for it through Sideling Hill exposed geological features of the mountain and has become a tourist attraction.\n\nUS 219 and US 220 travel concurrently with I-68 in Garrett County and Cumberland, Maryland, respectively, and US 40 overlaps with the freeway from Keysers Ridge to the eastern end of the freeway at Hancock.\n\nThe construction of I-68 began in 1965 and lasted for about 25 years, being completed on August 2, 1991. While the road was being built, it was predicted that the completion of the road would improve the economic situation along the corridor. The two largest cities connected by the highway are Morgantown and Cumberland, both with populations of fewer than 30,000 people. Despite the fact that the freeway serves no large metropolitan areas, I-68 provides a major transportation route in western Maryland and northern West Virginia and also provides an alternative to the Pennsylvania Turnpike for westbound traffic from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.\n\nThere have been several major planned road projects that would affect the freeway's corridor, which, due to major funding issues, are unlikely to be completed. These include a plan to extend I-68 to Moundsville, West Virginia, and the plan to link the Mon–Fayette Expressway, a toll highway which meets I-68 east of Morgantown, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nCorridor F is a highway in the U.S. states of Tennessee and Kentucky. It travels from Interstate 75 (I-75) in Caryville, Tennessee, northeasterly to Corridor B (U.S. Route 23 (US 23)) near Kentucky. Corridor F uses US 25W and Tennessee State Route 63 (SR 63) from I-75 to Corridor S (US 25E) in Harrogate, Tennessee. There, it turns northwest along US 25E, passing through the Cumberland Gap Tunnel into Kentucky. It leaves US 25E in Pineville, Kentucky, turning northeasterly along US 119, past an intersection with Corridor I (Kentucky Route 15 (KY 15)) in Whitesburg, to its end at Corridor B.\n\nCorridor G is a highway in the U.S. states of Kentucky and West Virginia that follows the route of U.S. Route 119 (US 119) from Pikeville, Kentucky, to Charleston, West Virginia. Construction on the road began in 1972 in West Virginia and 1974 in Kentucky, but it was more than two decades before the road was completed in either state. The full length of Corridor G in West Virginia was completed in 1997, but Kentucky's last segment was not opened until 2008.\n\nCorridor H is a highway in the U.S. states of West Virginia and Virginia. It travels from Weston, West Virginia to Strasburg, Virginia. In December 1999, a settlement agreement was reached, providing the framework for resumption of final design, right-of-way acquisition and construction activities on the Corridor H highway project. Corridor H is the only corridor highway that remains incomplete in the State of West Virginia. It begins at I-79 in Weston and will end at I-81 in Strasburg when complete. Virginia's portion of Corridor H runs from the West Virginia state line to I-81 at Strasburg, Virginia. The building of Corridor H was controversial, arousing strong passions for and against. Decades of public debate and legal battles aired the essential question of whether previously isolated areas should be preserved or opened to development. Despite the controversy, about 75 percent of the highway had been completed as of 2013. The highway is open from the Weston exit of I-79 to Kerens, Randolph County and an additional section of the four-lane is open from the Grant -Tucker, County line to Wardensville as of July, 2016.\n\nCorridor I is a highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky. It travels from Interstate 64 (I-64) southeasterly along the Mountain Parkway and Kentucky Route 15 (KY 15) to Corridor F (U.S. Route 119 (US 119)) in Whitesburg. Corridor I meets Corridor R (Mountain Parkway) near Campton and Hal Rogers Parkway and KY 80 in Hazard.\n\nCorridor J is a highway in the U.S. states of Tennessee and Kentucky. It travels from the end of Interstate 24 (I-24) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, north to I-75 in London, Kentucky.\n\nCorridor J uses U.S. Route 27 (US 27) from Chattanooga north to Soddy-Daisy. There it turns northwest on State Route 111 (SR 111), eventually curving to the north via Dunlap, Sparta, and Cookeville to Livingston. Then it turns northwest on SR 52 to Celina and northeast on SR 53 to Kentucky.\n\nUpon crossing into Kentucky, Corridor J becomes Kentucky Route 61 (KY 61), heading north to Burkesville. There it turns east on KY 90, which it follows to Burnside. Corridor J turns north on US 27 at Burnside, quickly turning northeast on KY 914 to bypass downtown Somerset and then east on KY 80 to London.\n\nListed in a US House of Representatives Report in 2002, was a proposed feasibility and the planning study to establish I-175 along Corridor J. However, no allocation of monies was appropriated and no additional discussion has been made since for this briefly proposed interstate along the corridor.\n\nUntil late 2005, Corridor J was to turn west just north of Cookeville along the planned SR 451 to SR 56 north of Baxter and then use SR 56 and SR 53 via Gainesboro.\n\nCorridor J-1 uses SR 56 and SR 53 from Algood to Celina, via Gainesboro; it is also proposed that the entire corridor be renumbered as SR 451. The corridor serves as an alternate route for Corridor J, avoiding Livingston. The entire route is two-lane with wide shoulders, allowing for possible expansion if needed.\n\nCorridor K is a highway in the U.S. states of Tennessee and North Carolina. Overlapped entirely by U.S. Route 74 (US 74), it also shorter concurrences with US 19, US 64, APD-40 (US 64 Bypass) US 129 and US 441. The corridor connects Interstate 75 (I-75) in Cleveland, Tennessee (northeast of Chattanooga), easterly to Corridor A (US 23) near Dillsboro, North Carolina.\n\nThere are two gaps in the corridor, one in each state. The gap in Tennessee is the Ocoee Scenic Byway along the Ocoee River from Parksville to Ducktown. Plans outline a new alternate route for this section since the current route does not meet the purpose and need to support the regional transportation goals of a safe, reliable and efficient east-west route. Currently in environmental study, a record of decision is expected in 2017. The gap in North Carolina is located from Andrews to Stecoah. Broken in three projects, the plan outlines a new four-lane expressway that will bypass north of the Nantahala Gorge and connect Robbinsville. At a total cost to NCDOT estimated at $443 million, it is currently in reprioritization.\n\nSince the corridor's establishment, the first major improvement for the corridor happened in 1979, when bypasses were completed for Murphy and Andrews. In 1986, US 74 was extended west from Asheville, overlapping all of Corridor K. Its last major improvement was in 2005, with the widening of NC 28 at Stecoah, first completed section Nantahala Gorge bypass. Now at 74.8% of the corridor completed, it features four-lane divided highway predominantly expressway grade, with sections in and around Cleveland, Cherokee and Dillsboro at freeway grade. The corridor also connects the cities of Ducktown and Bryson City, and features the Ocoee National Forest Scenic Byway, in Tennessee, and the Nantahala Byway, in North Carolina; treating travelers with grand vistas and various recreational activities.\n\nCorridor L is a highway in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It follows the path of U.S. Route 19 (US 19) between Beckley and Sutton. By exiting onto Corridor L from Interstate 79 (I-79) at milepost 57, a southbound traveler can eliminate , and $7.25 in tolls, re-entering the interstate system at the West Virginia Turnpike (I-64 and I-77) at milepost 48.\n\nOriginally, this corridor was built as a four-lane divided highway for only the portion south of US 60; however, the large amount of traffic (as part of the direct route from the cities of Toronto, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh to Florida and a considerable portion of the Atlantic southeast) forced the state to rethink this plan and upgrade the northern half to four lanes as well.\nCorridor M is a highway in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It extends (including that are ineligible), with completed, from the I-70/I-76 interchange at New Stanton to an interchange with I-81 near the Pennsylvania Turnpike at Harrisburg, following PA Turnpike 66 and U.S. Route 22. The estimated cost to complete this corridor is $1.40 billion, including $42 million for prefinanced projects. The remaining work includes the construction of four lanes generally paralleling US 22 between Hollidaysburg and Lewistown.\n\nProjects currently under way in Pennsylvania include:\n\nCorridor N is a highway in the U.S. states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. It is a designated portion of U.S. Route 219 (US 219), traveling from Corridor E (I-68/US 40) near Grantsville, Maryland, north to Corridor M (US 22 near Ebensburg, Pennsylvania). There is currently an attempt in the U.S. House of Representatives to extend this corridor, in the form of House bill H.R.1544 - Corridor N Extension Act of 2011. The act would extend Corridor N north from its current terminus at Corridor M to Corridor T in southwestern New York. The bill has not yet been brought before Congress for debate. As of January 2019, Corridor N has been completed as a controlled-access highway from just north of Ebensburg to Meyersdale. No portion of the route has been improved in Maryland.\n\nCorridor O is a highway in the U.S. states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. It is part of U.S. Route 220 (US 220), traveling from Corridor E, near Cumberland, Maryland, north to I-80, near Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. The part north of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-70/I-76) near Bedford is also I-99.\n\nCorridor O-1 begins at Corridor O at Port Matilda, Pennsylvania, and travels northwesterly along US 322 to I-80 near Clearfield.\n\nCorridor P is a highway in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It travels from a point near Mackeyville, eastward to Milton, via Williamsport.\n\nCorridor P-1 begins at Corridor M (US 22/US 322) near Duncannon and travels north for along US 11/US 15 and PA 147, meeting Corridor P at the interchange of Interstate 80 and I-180 near Milton.\n\nThe majority of the corridor's length from its southern terminus to Selinsgrove is a four-lane divided highway carrying the US 11 and US 15 designations. The northernmost of this section is a freeway bypassing Selinsgrove. The next is an unbuilt freeway named the Central Susquehanna Valley Thruway (CSVT), which will partially be designated US 15 and PA 147. Construction began on the northern half of the CSVT in 2016. The remaining of Corridor P-1 from the CSVT to I-80 and Corridor P is a four-lane freeway section of PA 147.\n\nCorridor Q is a highway in the U.S. states of Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia. It travels from US 23/US 119, near Pikeville, Kentucky, to Interstate 81, in Christiansburg, Virginia. In the 2013 fiscal year, the corridor is 82.2% completed.\nCorridor R is a highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky. It travels from Corridor I at the interchange of the Mountain Parkway and Kentucky Route 15 (KY 15) near Campton east along the Mountain Parkway and KY 114 to Corridor B (US 23/US 460) in Prestonsburg. It forms part of a route from Lexington, Kentucky to Roanoke, Virginia using Interstate 64 (I-64), Corridor I, Corridor R, Corridor B, Corridor Q, and I-81.\nCorridor S is a highway in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It is routed entirely along U.S. Route 25E (US 25E); from Interstate 81 (I-81), near Morristown, to State Route 63 (SR 63; Corridor F), in Harrogate. In the 2013 fiscal year, has been completed, while remains to be constructed.\n\nCorridor T is a highway in the U.S. states of Pennsylvania and New York. It travels from Greenfield Township, Pennsylvania (northwest of Erie) to Windsor, New York, and corresponds to Interstate 86, an upgrade of the existing New York State Route 17 (NY 17). An extension of the US 219 Southern Expressway will also join I-86.\n\nKnown as the Southern Tier Expressway and Quickway (split by Interstate 81 (I-81) at Binghamton, New York), I-86 will connect I-90 northeast of Erie, with I-87 (the New York State Thruway) near Harriman, New York. As of August 2008, it travels east from I-90 to NY 352 in Elmira, bringing the total length of highway designated as I-86 to (and remaining to be designated). Once completed, I-86 will stretch 388 miles (624 km) across the Southern Tier of New York from I-90 to I-87, shorter than the along the New York State Thruway to the north.\n\nSeveral sections of NY 17 are not up to freeway or Interstate Highway standards, and need to be upgraded before I-86 can be designated along its full length. These substandard sections are located near Elmira, Binghamton, and the Catskill Mountains.\n\nI-86 currently travels in Pennsylvania and in New York. Except for a section of about that dips into Pennsylvania near Waverly, New York but is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation, the rest of I-86 will be in New York.\nCorridor U is a highway in the U.S. states of Pennsylvania and New York. It begins at Corridor P (U.S. Route 220 (US 220)) near Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and proceeds generally northward to Corridor T (Interstate 86 (I-86)) in Elmira, New York. The corridor follows US 15 northward from Williamsport to Tioga Junction, where it turns northeastward to follow Pennsylvania Route 328 (PA 328), New York State Route 328 (NY 328), and New York State Route 14 (NY 14) through Elmira to I-86.\n\nThe portion along US 15 in Pennsylvania is slated to become Interstate 99.\nCorridor U-1 is a spur from Corridor U at Tioga, Pennsylvania, continuing north along I-99/US 15 to Corning, New York, where it connects with Corridor T (I-86). Only the portion in New York is signed as I-99; the portion in Pennsylvania is slated to become I-99 but is currently only signed as US 15.\n\nCorridor V is a highway in the U.S. states of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. Its termini are Interstate 55 (I-55) in Batesville, Mississippi, and I-24 west of Chattanooga, Tennessee.\nAs of late 2014, the following portions of Corridor V have been recently completed or are underway:\n\nBoth sections of highway are currently under design by the Mississippi Department of Transportation, with the portion that will travel concurrently with MS 25 already under construction near Fulton.\n\nA widening project is also underway on Alabama State Route 24 (SR 24) between Red Bay and Russellville, as this section of Corridor V was previously reconstructed as an improved two-lane route within divided a four-lane right-of-way.\n\nCorridor V between Batesville and Fulton was also designated as National Highway System High Priority Corridor 42 and a Future Interstate Corridor as part of the 1998 Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century; originally, Corridor 42 also included a concurrency with Corridor X between Fulton and Birmingham, Alabama, but this concurrency was removed in subsequent legislation. However, the portion of the route between Batesville and Tupelo was only constructed to four-lane divided highway standards, making Interstate highway designation unlikely in the near future.\n\nCorridor V was also designated as High Priority Corridor 11 in the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995.\n\nCorridor W is a highway in the U.S. states of South Carolina and North Carolina. It is routed entirely along U.S. Route 25 (US 25); from Interstate 85 (I-85), in Greenville, South Carolina, to I-26, near East Flat Rock, North Carolina. The entire corridor is four-lane, that is expressway grade in South Carolina and freeway grade in North Carolina. Of the entire route, only was authorized for ADHS funding. In the 2013 fiscal year, both states completed their sections of Corridor W; South Carolina also became the first state to complete its entire ADHS miles of any of the 13 Appalachian states.\n\nCorridor X is a highway in the U.S. states of Mississippi and Alabama. It travels from Fulton, Mississippi, to Interstate 65, in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nCorridor X-1 or the Birmingham Northern Beltline is a proposed northern bypass around Birmingham, Alabama. Beginning at I-20/I-59/US-11 and I-459, south of Bessemer, Alabama, it will travel northwest connecting with I-22, US 78, I-65, then ending at I-59 north of I-459.\n\n"}

{"id": "2003910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003910", "title": "PrimeCo", "text": "PrimeCo\n\nPrimeCo Personal Communications, L.P. (later known as Chicago 20 MHz, LLC) was a joint venture of Bell Atlantic, Nynex, US West and AirTouch Communications, and was the first wireless telecommunications provider to turn up CDMA service on the PCS (1900-MHz) band in November 1996. When the company was founded, it had its headquarters in Westlake, Texas. At a later point its headquarters were in Itasca, Illinois.\n\nHailed as the largest wireless phone service launch in U.S. history, the company successfully launched in 19 major U.S. cities. The company's original cell site equipment suppliers were Motorola and AT&T (now Lucent Technologies), and the original telephone supplier was Qualcomm Personal Electronics, a joint venture between Qualcomm and Sony Electronics. The company served parts of the Midwestern and Southern United States. The two primary service areas included Wisconsin, northern and central Illinois, and northern Indiana; and parts of Virginia and North Carolina, as well as the Gulf Coast from Key West, Florida to Houston, Texas. PrimeCo had the license to operate in Hawaii.\n\nPrimeCo won many marketing awards for innovative advertising campaigns. The first \"tease\" campaign had scenes like a pizza delivery man \"beaming\" onto a beach a few seconds after the order is placed. The viewer is left to wonder what the product or service is. The tag line was \"Someday, everything will work this well.\" Overall, the tease campaign featured looks into the future, where technology could create a utopian existence, in part brought on by the advent of inexpensive and easy to use wireless PCS phone service.\n\nThe original corporate logo contained a red rounded edge box with an antenna projecting out of the top right corner.\n\nThe second campaign, which ran after the company started service, featured a cute (computer animated), bright-pink, little alien named Primetheus, who comes to Earth from planet Primeco, loses his \"communicator\" (which the Earthlings find and replicate), and then gets into all kinds of comical situations looking for it. The company set a new record for the number of subscribers signing up for service the first year. These campaigns were created by Dallas-based The Richards Group, and conceived by Creative Director Timothy Stapleton and Creative Director Brian Nadurak, now of Click Here.\n\nAirTouch received takeover bids from Bell Atlantic, MCI, and finally Vodafone, which was the winner and merged with AirTouch in January 1999. Later the same year, Bell Atlantic approached Vodafone Airtouch about merging all three wireless operations (Bell Atlantic Mobile, AirTouch Cellular, and PrimeCo Communications) into a joint venture to be called Verizon Wireless . Due to FCC regulations regarding duplication of frequencies, the PrimeCo territories were split up with: most of the Gulf Coast going into Verizon Wireless, except in Houston, where Verizon Wireless retained 10 MHz of spectrum and the remaining 20 MHz were sold to AT&T Wireless; Virginia and North Carolina territories sold to CFW Communications, a regional landline telecom provider since 1987, now operating under the name of nTelos; and the Midwest territories split up, with Wisconsin going into Verizon Wireless, and the Illinois and Indiana territories - like Houston - were disaggregated, with Verizon Wireless retaining 10 MHz of spectrum, and the remaining 20 MHz placed into a trust fund. The Illinois-Indiana PrimeCo territories were purchased by Clarity Partners, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm in 2001, who successfully improved the company's operations and later sold it to U.S. Cellular. PrimeCo's operations in Hawaii were sold to Sprint PCS in 1999.\n\nWhen the company was founded, PrimeCo was headquartered in the Solana Office Complex in Westlake, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth. The headquarters site was selected in 1995. In 1999 the parties splitting PrimeCo agreed that the former headquarters would become the headquarters of the PrimeCo operations taken over by Vodafone AirTouch. The later version of PrimeCo was headquartered in Itasca, Illinois.\n\nPrimeCo was referenced in Lil' Troy's Wanna Be a Baller song with the lyric \"Switched from Motorola to a PrimeCo phone\". This was meant to reference the smaller phones allowed by digital cellular service.\n\nThis reference actually refers to switching from Motorola beepers to the newly introduced PrimeCo cell phone in the late nineties. This would have a significant impact on the \"Baller's\" efficiency. The simple fact that you no longer had to stop and find a pay phone in order to respond to the beep you just received. Certain street business activities were exponentiated over the next couple of years with the advent of cellular phones.\n\nIt is likely that the lyrics author was not aware that Motorola was a manufacturer of cellular phones, and PrimeCo was a provider of cellular services.\n\n"}

Tourists can access the subterranean environment on a tramway.\n\nThe caves were first mentioned in historical documents in 1795, and were rediscovered in the early 1970s by Jack Peeples. \n\nThey were developed by the government as part of a tram tour, and opened to the public in 1981.\n\nHarrison's Cave is in the central uplands of Barbados. It is situated at above sea level. The three characteristics of the central uplands are gullies, sinkholes and caverns. It is also an entrance for another place of interest: Welchman Hall Gully which is closed.\n\nThe caves are naturally formed by water erosion through the limestone rock. The calcium-rich water that runs through the caves have formed the unusual stalactites and stalagmites formations. \n\nTravel through the caves is by tram, at certain points during the tour visitors are allowed to alight from the tram and get close up to the formations. One main area of the caves is a huge cavern, termed \"\"The Great Hall\"\", measuring over in height. After the Great Hall the tram stops at \"\"The Village\"\". At \"The Village\" some of the formations have joined together to form columns after thousands of years. Other areas the tram stops along the tour is \"The Chapel,\" \"The Rotunda,\" and \"The Altar.\" Visitors travel through the Boyce Tunnel via tram to all depths of the cave. \n"}

It is made from sugar, water, gelatin, vegetable fat or shortening, and glycerol. It does not have the texture of most icings; rolled fondant is akin to stiff clay, while poured fondant is a thick liquid. The word, in French, means \"melting,\" coming from the same root as \"fondue\" and \"foundry.\" However, what the French call \"fondant\" is sugar glaze, which has to be applied hot on pastries like \"mille-feuille,\" while fondant icing would be referred as \"pâte à sucre,\" meaning \"sugar paste.\"\n\n\"Poured fondant\" is a creamy confection used as a filling or coating for cakes, pastries, and candies or sweets.\nIn its simplest form, it is sugar and water stabilized with gelatin and glycerine. It is cooked to the soft-ball stage, cooled slightly, and stirred or beaten to incorporate air, until it is an opaque mass with a creamy consistency. Sometimes lemon or vanilla is added to the mixture for taste. Other flavorings are used as well, as are various colorings. An example of its use is the Cadbury Creme Egg, the filling of which is inverted sugar syrup, produced by processing fondant with invertase. Fondant fancies are a type of cake typically coated in poured fondant.\n\n\"Rolled fondant,\" \"fondant icing,\" or \"pettinice,\" which is not the same material as poured fondant, is commonly used to decorate wedding cakes. Although wedding cakes are traditionally made with marzipan and royal icing, fondant is increasingly common due to nut allergies as it does not require almond meal. Rolled fondant includes gelatin (or agar in vegetarian recipes) and food-grade glycerine, which keeps the sugar pliable and creates a dough-like consistency. Rolled fondant is rolled out like a pie crust and used to cover the cake.\n\nCommercial shelf-stable rolled fondant often consists principally of sugar and hydrogenated oil. However, different formulations for commercial shelf-stable fondant are available and include other ingredients, such as sugar, cellulose gum, and water.\n\n\"Marshmallow fondant\" is a form of rolled fondant often made and used by home bakers and hobbyists. Marshmallow fondant is made by combining melted shelf-stable marshmallows, water, powdered sugar, and solid vegetable shortening. Home bakers use this recipe for homemade fondant due to the readily available access to required ingredients.\n\n\"Sculpting fondant\" is similar to rolled fondant but with a stiffer consistency, which makes it a good sculpting material.\n\n\"Sugar paste\" or \"gum paste\" is similar to rolled fondant, but hardens completely—and therefore is used for bigger cake decorations, such as bride and groom figures, bigger flowers, etc. Sugar paste is made mainly of egg whites, powdered sugar, and shortening. Tylose can be added to make gum paste more pliable for detailed work.\n\nPoured fondant is formed by supersaturating water with sucrose. More than twice as much sugar dissolves in water at the boiling point than at room temperature. After the sucrose dissolves, if the solution is left to cool undisturbed, the sugar remains dissolved in a supersaturated solution until nucleation occurs. While the solution is supersaturated, if a cook puts a seed crystal (undissolved sucrose) into the mix, or agitates the solution, the dissolved sucrose crystallizes to form large, crunchy crystals (which is how rock candy is made). However, if the cook lets the solution cool undisturbed and then stirs it vigorously, it forms many tiny crystals, resulting in a smooth-textured fondant.\n\n"}
{"id": "2003936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003936", "title": "Big Blue Bus", "text": "Big Blue Bus\n\nThe Santa Monica Big Blue Bus is a municipal bus operator in the Westside region of Los Angeles County, that provides local and bus rapid transit service in Santa Monica and adjacent neighborhoods of Los Angeles (including LAX). Express service is also provided to Downtown Los Angeles and Union Station.\nThe impetus for the creation was a fare increase on the Pacific Electric interurban trains between Santa Monica and Los Angeles. Santa Monica Municipal Bus Lines was founded on 14 April 1928, and launched its first route, choosing a blue livery. Culver CityBus was founded in 4 March 1928, making it the second oldest municipal bus line in California and the oldest public transit bus system still operating in Los Angeles County. San Francisco Municipal Railway began streetcar service 28 December 1912.\n\n\"Santa Monica Municipal Bus Lines\" kept its base fare at 10 cents for a long time. The Santa Monica bus connected with the Los Angeles Railway streetcars at Pico and Rimpau Boulevards in the Mid-City section of Los Angeles. That historic terminus point has become an important transit center in Los Angeles simply because it is the point where thousands of bus riders along Pico Boulevard must transfer to continue their trips eastward to Downtown Los Angeles or westward to the Westside.\n\nThe Big Blue Bus is considered one of the best bus services in the Los Angeles area. The system won the American Public Transportation Association’s \"Outstanding Transportation System\" award in 1987, 1992, 1997, 2000 and 2011. The Big Blue Bus did not raise its regular fare above 50 cents until 2002, when it became 75 cents. In contrast, most public bus lines in California were charging fares of a dollar or more well before 2000. There was no monthly pass until August 2010 except for the EZ Pass, and unlike other EZ Pass agencies, Metrolink fare media are not accepted. However, allowing for the inevitability of traffic delays on weekday afternoons, the Big Blue Bus system provides frequent and convenient service to most neighborhoods in its service area. Many routes serve UCLA.\n\nThe Big Blue Bus was one of the last transit agencies using the GMC New Look buses; they were retired in 2005. Big Blue Bus received the last New Looks ever built. The last one built, #5180, was driven off the property in May 2013 after being donated to the Museum of Bus Transportation in Hershey, Pennsylvania, which preserves the bus. It was also the first transit agency in the State of California to use the Grumman-Flxible Model 870 advanced design transit buses equipped with Lift-U wheelchair lifts beginning in 1978, and the third customer after Atlanta's MARTA, and the Connecticut's Department of Transportation's CT Transit's order of these buses. These buses never experienced the same chronic structural problems that plagued these early vehicles that were also sold to other transit agencies. These were also the very first production buses built with wheelchair lifts before ADA effectively became law of the land in 1990.\n\nFor 20 years until December 1999 Santa Monica Bank ran a series of humorous ads on the back of the buses. Examples include \"Old and wrinkled is beautiful. Especially in large denominations\", \"Go invest, young man\", \"Was it his eyes? His lips?

The campaign ended as the bank was absorbed by U.S. Bank.\n\nThe system was started by former Brentwood resident Rudolph F. Brunner, who later sold the system thinking it wouldn't amount to any more than a few dollars a week.\n\nOn November 20, 2012, a Big Blue Bus turned left in front of an oncoming motorcyclist, which resulted in the 25-year-old man's death. The accident occurred at approximately 10:33 a.m. at the triangular intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Marquez in the Pacific Palisades. Only buses are allowed to make the left turn, a maneuver that has been determined to be too dangerous for other vehicles.\n\nOn June 7, 2013, Bus 4057 of Big Blue Bus was among several vehicles fired at during a thirteen-minute killing spree that left six people dead, including the gunman, and four others wounded. Three women suffered minor injuries aboard the bus, one from shrapnel-type injuries and the other two from injuries unrelated to the gunfire. Approximately two dozen people were inside the bus at the time of the shooting. The attack on Bus 4057 marked the first time a Big Blue Bus came under attack by a gunman in its 85-year service.\nBig Blue Bus operates 14 local routes, 4 Rapid routes, and a couple of the local routes go into the Los Angeles City which are the 7,R7,3, R3 and the R12.\n\n\nThe most famous Big Blue Bus is probably the one rigged with a bomb in 1994's hit movie \"Speed.\" Driving through Los Angeles at rush hour, the bus has to keep its speed over 50 mph (80 km/h) or the bomb on the bus will detonate.\n\nTwo humorous slogans Santa Monica Bank used on Big Blue Buses appeared in the film. The bus operator in the movie is called the \"Santa Monica Intercity Bus Lines\", a barely fictionalized version of the Big Blue Bus's official name, the Santa Monica Municipal Bus Lines. Even more tellingly, the bus in the film is a General Motors \"New Look\" bus, introduced in 1959 but kept in prominent and active service by Santa Monica until early 2005, long after most other American cities had retired the retro-looking bus.\n\nIn another effort to differentiate the movie's bus from any real-world bus, the headsigns on the \"Speed\" bus display:\n\nHowever, number 33 buses are operated by Metro, not Big Blue, and run on Venice Boulevard, not the Santa Monica Freeway. The closest thing to the movie bus's routing is Santa Monica's number 10 express route.\n\nThe bus number was 2525, not within any equipment number range operated by the real company at that time.\n\nIt should also be noted that at the time the movie was released, Santa Monica's GM New Look fleet were the Canadian-built versions with wheelchair lifts; the US-built versions were retired in 1990 to make room for the Classics.\n\nIn an episode that originally aired on May 15, 2007, the ABC late-night show, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", was filmed on a New Flyer L40LF model LNG bus. In this episode, titled \"Jimmy Kimmel Live on a Bus\", Kimmel sat behind the desk, which was rigged to fit in a bus. This particular Santa Monica Big Blue Bus that was used in the episode was driven by veteran bus driver Erskins Robinson, who picked up unsuspecting passengers along his route. The celebrity guests who appeared in the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live on a Bus\" episode were Paula Abdul, Flavor Flav, and musical guest Feist.\n\nA Blue Bus is referred to twice in The Doors's classic 1967 song \"The End\", when singer Jim Morrison says \"The blue bus is calling us\", and \"Meet me at the back of the blue bus\".\n\nIn Raymond Chandler's novel \"Farewell, My Lovely\", first published in 1940, he writes as protagonist Philip Marlowe, describing a scene in Bay City (Chandler's version of the City of Santa Monica):\n\nIn the episode ”Namaste\" (season 9, episode 7), Larry David is forced to catch a bus, an activity he is not accustomed to. The eandevor ends with Larry being kicked off the bus.\nThe bus station is the Montana/San-Vincente station in Brentwood which serves lines 14 and 18.\n\nAyer, Bob. \"History of Santa Monica's Big Blue Bus\".

{"id": "2003947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003947", "title": "Margaret Garner", "text": "Margaret Garner\n\nMargaret Garner (called \"Peggy\") was an enslaved African-American woman in pre-Civil War America who was notorious – or celebrated – for killing her own daughter rather than allowing the child to be returned to slavery. She and her family had escaped in January 1856 across the frozen Ohio River to Cincinnati, but they were apprehended by U.S. Marshals acting under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Margaret Garner's defense attorney, John Jolliffe, moved to have her tried for murder in Ohio, to be able to get a trial in a free state and to challenge the Fugitive Slave Law as well.\n\nHer story was the inspiration for the novel \"Beloved\" (1987) by Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison, which was adapted into a film of the same name starring Oprah Winfrey (1998), as well as for her libretto for the opera \"Margaret Garner\" (2005), composed by Richard Danielpour.\n\nOther pieces of fiction inspired by Garner's story include, John Jolliffe's \"Belle Scott\" (1856), N.K. Jemisin's \"The Fifth Season\" (2015), and K.A. Simpson's \"A Coven's Lament\" (2017).\n\nGarner, described as a mulatto, was born a house slave to the Gaines family of Maplewood plantation, Boone County, Kentucky. She may have been the daughter of the plantation owner John Pollard Gaines himself.\n\nMargaret married one of her fellow slaves, Robert Garner, in 1849. That December, the plantation was sold along with all the slaves to John P. Gaines' younger brother, Archibald K. Gaines. The Garners' first child, Thomas, was born early in 1850.\n\nThree of Margaret's later children (Samuel, Mary, and Priscilla) were described as mulattoes; each was born five to seven months after a child born to Archibald K. Gaines and his wife. These light-skinned children were likely the children of A.K. Gaines, the only adult white male at Maplewood. The timing suggests they were each conceived after his wife had become pregnant and was sexually unavailable to him.\n\nIn a contemporary account, abolitionist Levi Coffin described Margaret Garner at her arrest as \"a mulatto, about five feet high ... she appeared to be about twenty-one or twenty-three years old.\" She also had an old scar on the left side of her forehead and cheek, which she said had been caused when a \"White man struck me.\" Her two boys were about four and six years old, Mary, two and a half, and Priscilla, an infant.\n\nOn January 28, 1856, Robert and a pregnant Margaret, together with family members, escaped and fled to Cincinnati, Ohio, along with several other enslaved families. Robert had stolen his master's horses and sleigh along with his gun. Seventeen people were reported to have been in their party. In the coldest winter in 60 years, the Ohio River had frozen. The group crossed the ice just west of Covington, Kentucky at daybreak, and escaped to Cincinnati, then divided to avoid detection.\n\nRobert and Margaret and their four children, with Robert's father Simon and his wife Mary, made their way to a former slave, Margaret's Uncle Joe Kite, who lived along Mill Creek, below Cincinnati. The other nine slaves in their party reached safe houses in Cincinnati and eventually escaped via the Underground Railroad to Canada. Kite went to abolitionist Levi Coffin for advice on how to get the group to safety. Coffin agreed to help them escape the city, and told Kite to take the Garner group further west of the city, where many free blacks lived, and to wait until night.\n\nSlave catchers and U.S. Marshals found the Garners barricaded inside Kite's house before he returned. They surrounded the property, then stormed the house. Robert Garner fired several shots and wounded at least one deputy marshal. Margaret killed her two-year-old daughter with a butcher knife rather than see the child returned to slavery. She had wounded her other children, preparing to kill them and herself, when she was subdued by the posse.\n\nThe entire group was taken to jail. The subsequent trial lasted for two weeks, after which the judge deliberated another two weeks. It was \"the longest and most complicated case of its kind.\" A typical fugitive slave hearing would have lasted less than a day. The core issue was whether the Garners would be tried as persons, and charged with the murder of their daughter, or tried as property under the Fugitive Slave Law. The defense attorney argued that Ohio's right to protect its citizens should take precedence. The slave catchers and owner argued for the precedence of federal law over the state.\n\nThe defense attempted to prove that Margaret had been liberated under a former law covering slaves taken into free states for other work. Her attorney proposed that she be charged with murder so that the case would be tried in a free state (understanding that the governor would later pardon her). The prosecuting attorney argued that the federal Fugitive Slave Law took precedence over state murder charges. Over a thousand people turned out each day to watch the proceedings, lining the streets outside the courthouse. Five hundred men were deputized to maintain order in the town.\n\nThe presiding judge, Pendery, ruled that Federal fugitive warrants had supervening authority. Defense attorney John Jolliffe then tried a strategy of arguing that the Fugitive Slave Act violated the guarantee of religious freedom, by compelling citizens to participate in evil by returning slaves. In the end, Pendery rejected this argument.\n\nOn the closing day of the trial, the antislavery activist Lucy Stone took the stand to defend her earlier conversations with Margaret (the prosecution had complained.) She spoke about the interracial sexual relationship that underlay part of the case:\n\nRecalling to everyone's memory the faces of Margaret's children, and of A. K. Gaines, Stone told the packed courtroom: \"The faded faces of the Negro children tell too plainly to what degradation the female slaves submit. Rather than give her daughter to that life, she killed it. If in her deep maternal love she felt the impulse to send her child back to God, to save it from coming woe, who shall say she had no right not to do so?\"\n\nMargaret Garner's actions were driven by her master's abuse and the well known abuse slaves faced nationwide. Women were known to practice infanticide to alleviate the burden of slavery from their children; however, in Garner's case her children faced even more opposition due to their being mulattos. Mulattoes were seen as a threat as well as a disgrace among the plantation and white families, because the birth of mulatto children highlighted infidelity within the slave-owning families. They reminded the family of a perceived sin, and were often beaten or sold. Garner underwent drastic measures to protect her child not only from the cruelty of the institution of slavery, but from the double threat, due to the child's mulatto status.\n\nMargaret Garner was not immediately tried for murder, but was forced to return to a slave state along with Robert and their youngest child, a daughter of about nine months old. When Ohio authorities got an extradition warrant for Garner to try her for murder, they were unable to find her for the arrest. Archibald K. Gaines, her owner, kept moving her between cities in Kentucky. Ohio officials missed finding Margaret in Covington by a few hours, missed getting her again in Frankfort, and finally caught up with her master in Louisville, only to discover that he had put the slaves on a boat headed for his brother's plantation in Arkansas.\n\n\"The Liberator\" reported on March 11, 1856, that the steamboat \"Henry Lewis\", on which the Garners were being transported, began to sink after colliding with another boat. Margaret Garner and her baby daughter were thrown overboard during the collision. The baby drowned. It was reported that Margaret was happy that her baby had died and that she tried to drown herself. She and Robert were kept in Arkansas only a short time before being sent to Gaines' family friends in New Orleans as a household servant. The Garners then disappeared from sight.\n\nIn 1870 a reporter from \"The Cincinnati Chronicle\" found Robert Garner and gathered more about his life. Robert and Margaret Garner had worked in New Orleans, and in 1857 were sold to Judge Dewitt Clinton Bonham for plantation labor at Tennessee Landing, Mississippi. Robert said Margaret had died in 1858 of typhoid fever, in an epidemic in the valley. He said that before she died, Margaret urged him to \"never marry again in slavery, but to live in hope of freedom.\"\n\nGarner's life story was the basis of Frances Harper's 1859 poem \"Slave Mother: A Tale of Ohio\". She also inspired Kentucky painter Thomas Satterwhite Noble's 1867 painting, \"The Modern Medea\"; Medea was a woman in Greek mythology who killed her own children. The painting, owned by Cincinnati manufacturer Procter and Gamble Corporation, was presented as a gift to the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, where it remains on permanent display. Learning about Margaret Garner's trial and story, Toni Morrison was inspired to write her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"Beloved\" (1987).\n\nYears later the Michigan Opera Theatre, Cincinnati Opera and the Opera Company of Philadelphia commissioned the opera \"Margaret Garner\". Morrison wrote the libretto and music was composed by the Grammy-winning Richard Danielpour. The opera premiered in those three cities in 2005. It set records for opera attendance in Cincinnati. In Detroit, it played to unusually large audiences with a high number of African Americans. It was sold out in Philadelphia. Mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves sang Margaret Garner, and baritone Rod Gilfry sang the role of the plantation owner Edward Gaines.\n\nIn 2008, documentary filmmaker, Joanne Caputo, winner of the PBS Independent Lens Audience Award for her 2005 \"On A Roll: Family, Disability and the American Dream,\" self-published \"Margaret Garner: Diversity and Depth of Love.\" The non-fiction two-book manuscript includes a memoir, in which Caputo describes her paranormal experiences with Margaret Garner and a claim of being Garner's reincarnated murdered daughter.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2003948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003948", "title": "Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps", "text": "Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps\n\nThe Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps is a World Class competitive junior drum and bugle corps. Based in Canton, Ohio, the Bluecoats are a member corps of Drum Corps International (DCI). The Bluecoats were the 2016 DCI World Class champions.\n\nThe Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps was founded in 1972 by Canton businessman Art Drukenbrod and Canton Police officers \"Babe\" Stearn and Ralph McCauley, the director and assistant director of the Canton Police Boys' Club. The corps members chose the name both because of their sponsorship and to honor the city's police officers, particularly those who had retired from the ranks. The corps made its competition debut in 1974 and, in their first major show, finished thirty-second of thirty-seven corps in the U.S. Open Class A prelims in Marion, Ohio. The corps improved year by year, and began touring in both the U.S. and Canada and making U.S. Open finals in 1976, taking second place in 1977 and third in 1978. The Bluecoats made their first DCI appearance in Denver in 1977, scoring in thirty-fifth place among forty-five corps.\n\nAlthough the corps was maturing musically, it was struggling to survive financially. 1979 saw the corps performing only in local parades, as it attempted to reorganize its financial situation. With the return to the field in 1980, the corps was competitive in Class A competitions but only managed a thirty-eighth-place finish of the forty-four corps performing in Open Class at the DCI World Championships in Birmingham, Alabama. In the next two seasons, the corps attempted to compete exclusively in Open Class, but they met with small success. In 1983, it was announced that the Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps would cease operations.\n\nAt the time that the corps' folding was announced, present-day corps President Scott Swaldo was a marching member. When he told his father, Canton industrialist Ted Swaldo (now the corps' Director Emeritus), the elder Swaldo stated his determination to prevent it and stepped in to try to save the corps. One of Swaldo's first moves as corps director was to see that the organization was run like a business, a concept that has since been spread to numerous non-profit youth organizations around the country. With successful fund-raising projects and a solid business plan in place, the corps returned to the field after only a one-year hiatus. As a full-fledged Open Class corps the Bluecoats improved with each passing year until, in 1987, the corps became the first corps from Ohio to earn a place in the DCI World Championship finals, finishing in eleventh place. Since then, the corps has failed to make DCI Finals only once (1999), and the Bluecoats have become a consistent DCI contender.\n\nIn the early days the corps traveled in blue-painted surplus Army buses, then in used school buses, later moving up to used, but air-conditioned, motor coaches. At first, meals were served from a U-Haul trailer towed by a parent's car, later from a van, then a travel trailer, before the eventual acquisition of an eighteen-wheeled semi-trailer kitchen. Today the corps travels around the country during its summer tour in a convoy with chartered buses, an equipment truck, cook truck, souvenir trailer, and staff vehicles.\n\nIn 2010, the corps medaled for the first time at the DCI World Championships, taking the bronze with their production \"Metropolis: The Future Is Now.\" In 2014, they made corps history again by taking the silver medal for their show \"\"TILT.\"\" In 2015, the corps performed their production entitled \"Kinetic Noise,\" taking home the bronze.\n\nAt the 2016 DCI World Championships, the Bluecoats won 1st place in World Class Finals, becoming only the tenth corps to be DCI Champions since the competition began in 1972. The winning show, \"Down Side Up,\" earned the corps' highest DCI score (at the time) of 97.650 while winning the General Effect and Music captions on finals night. For 2016, the Bluecoats abandoned their traditional uniforms blue coats in favor of a more informal costume designed with the show's near-constant motion in mind; the brass and percussion wore white and the color guard yellow, both with a swirling, sequined blue accent stripe running from the left hand to the shoulder, across the chest, and down the right leg; Bluecoats also became the first corps to win the DCI title while not wearing hats, helmets, shakos, or any other type of headgear. This trend of non-traditional uniforms has continued since then, and has been emulated by numerous other corps since 2016.\n\nAt the 2019 DCI World Championships, the Bluecoats came second place while scoring the corps' highest ever score of 98.238, winning the General Effect Caption and tying for 1st in Music on finals night. \n\nAt the end of 2016 it was announced that the Bluecoats had been selected to send a team of 30 people to Hong Kong to perform with Pegasus Vanguard in Hong Kong's 2017 Chinese New Year Celebration. They were invited to perform in Hong Kong again for the 2019 Chinese New Year Celebration. \n\nIn 2017 shortly after WGI World Championships in Dayton Ohio, the Bluecoats announced a formation of their own WGI World Class Color Guard unit, named Bloo Indoor. In 2018, the guard finished in 12th place, making it into finals their very first year. In 2019 they broke into the top 10, finishing in 9th place. It was announced that the group would not be competing for the 2020 WGI season. \n\nThe Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps is a 501 (c) (3) musical organization that has a Board of Directors, corps director, and staff assigned to carry out the organization's mission. The Director Emeritus is Ted Swaldo, the President is Scott Swaldo, Mike Scott is the Chief Executive Officer, Genevieve Geisler is Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operations Officer, former CEO David Glasgow is the Executive Advisor, and the Corps Manager is Bill Hamilton.\n\nThe Bluecoats organization also sponsors the Artistry IN BLUE Winter Guard and the Rhythm IN BLUE Alumni Ensemble. Additionally, the corps owns and operates the Champion Event Center, a community bingo, banquet and special events center in North Canton. In April 2017, the corps announced the founding of a second Winter Guard that will begin competing in 2018; Bluecoats Indoor will be based in the Indianapolis area.\n\n\"Source:\" \n\n\"Gold background indicates DCI Championship; pale blue background indicates DCI Class Finalist; pale green background indicates DCI semifinalist.\"\nAt the annual World Championship Finals, Drum Corps International (DCI) presents awards to the corps with the high average scores from prelims, semifinals, and finals in five captions. The Bluecoats have won these captions:\n\nDon Angelica Best General Effect Award\n\nAt the Bluecoats first appearance at DCI Finals in 1987, their over-the-top arrangement of the Joseph Kosma-Johnny Mercer song Autumn Leaves, with a fifteen-member snare drum line brought forth the spontaneous long shouts from the audience of, \"Bloooo... Blooooo... Blooooo...\"– a crowd reaction that began with one former member during the 1985 and 1986 seasons and amplified by legendary Drum Corps Midwest announcer Joe Bruno and grew throughout the 1987 season. This has since come to be the audience's traditional greeting as the corps enters the field and response as they finish their show, which has become one of the most recognizable acts of audience participation in the drum corps activity. Newcomers to drum corps are often shocked by this unique reaction, until it is explained that, \"They're not booing; they're blooing.\"\n\nThe Bluecoats' corps song is, \"Autumn Leaves\", which became the corps' song after the 1987 season, in honor of the corps making its first DCI Finals appearance. The song has remained a part of the corps' repertoire since 1987, and it reappeared in their 1988 and 1998 shows. It can also frequently be heard being performed during impromptu parking lot concerts after competitions. The corps' first official song was \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" by Paul Simon, which was a huge hit for Simon and Garfunkel shortly before the corps was founded and was performed by the corps in 1976 & '77. It had been played at encores since the 2012 season, when it was brought back in honor of the corps' 40th anniversary, but it has since been replaced as an encore piece by an earlier Simon and Garfunkle hit, \"The Boxer\" (also written by Paul Simon) which was a wildly popular tune in the corps' 2008 program. Another song that is frequently performed in the lots and at encores is \"Creep\" by Radiohead from their 2011 show \"A Brave New World\". Also occasionally The Bluecoats perform their 2014 ballad \"The Hymn of Acxiom\" by Vienna Teng during camps and home show encores.\n\nAlthough there have been departures over the years, the Bluecoats were widely known for performing big band jazz arrangements of their musical programs. More recently, however, the corps has created an identity based around innovation in electronics and creative design in DCI.\n\nLike most drum corps, the Bluecoats hold an annual \"home show\" in Massillon, OH near their hometown. It has become a local tradition that the Bluecoats' home show is a part of the induction festivities for Pro Football Hall of Fame, which is located in Canton. In the 2019 summer, the corps performed during halftime for the NFL Hall of Fame football game.\n\nThe Bluecoats have a tradition of giving each member a blue necklace made out of shoelace with silver-plated pennies attached with a link from the chin strap of a Bluecoats helmet. Each member gets one penny or equivalent currency from each nationality represented in the corps that season, each year that they march in the corps on the morning of finals day. Members also receive a nickel after marching their fifth year in the Bluecoats.\n\nThe Bluecoats started a tradition back in 2016 of becoming the last corps to release their show title for the competition season. Often preferring to wait until within 3 hours of their first performance to release show uniforms, and later on the title. However, they do release their show repertoire within 2-3 weeks of their premiere performance.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Bluecoats created the secret phrase \"Six Words\" and is only told to new members after performing their first home show of the season. The phrase was started by Errick Prince, a member and long time veteran of the corps, along with others. The phrase is said to unite members of the corps from any timeframe, linking all Bluecoats past and present. In addition to the Bluecoats logo and the autumn leaf, many Bluecoats members even have the phrase \"Six Words\" tattooed. \n\n"}

During one visit in 1965 he suffered a heart attack and was treated in a large private suite in the old hospital for two weeks before being sent to Walter Reed in Washington by train. Later in 1975, former First Lady Mamie Eisenhower, was treated at Ft. Gordon for internal bleeding.\n\nActive-duty personnel and their TRICARE beneficiaries use the medical center and clinics for their primary health care. Numerous military retirees in the Augusta area use the medical center's pharmacy and facilities.\nEAMC is involved in the growing field of disaster medicine and hosts disaster-drill training events on Fort Gordon involving the civilian medical community and the local region of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nThe hospital is a training hospital for military doctors, and partners with the Medical College of Georgia and Augusta Veterans Affairs Medical Center in training programs and patient care. For example, TRICARE dependents in need of obstetrics services are sent to UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF AUGUSTA, while the Augusta VA runs a spinal-cord rehabilitation unit and an active duty rehabilitation unit, which has hosted many veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In return, civilian, non-TRICARE dependent patients are often sent to Eisenhower for use of its hyperbaric chamber.\n\nThe Wound Care Center is one of the most advanced in the DoD. The state-of-the-art wound care center has recently added ultrasonic wound debriders to minimize tissue damage caused by severe bacterial infections. EAMC’s hyperbaric chamber is the only clinical hyperbaric chamber in the U.S. Army and the only multiplace chamber in the Central Savannah River Area. The chamber can also be used to treat a wide variety of issues including air or gas embolisms, carbon monoxide poisoning, decompression sickness (The Bends), anemia, radiation tissue damage, and thermal burns.\n\nEAMC is pioneering DoD/VA sharing agreements with the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Augusta, Ga., Dublin, Ga., and Columbia, S.C., and network agreements with other hospitals and medical centers in the Augusta area. The relationships have infused millions of dollars into the Augusta community, as well as provided veterans, beneficiaries and family members with better access to the care and procedures they need. There are Two Hyberbaric Chambers at Doctors Hospital in Augusta Georgia\n\nEAMC’s Cardiothoracic Surgery Clinic does more heart surgeries than any medical facility in the DoD. A wide range of cardiac, thoracic, vascular services, and minimally invasive techniques are used to address cardiothoracic issues.\n\nThe 30-bed Residential Treatment Facility is an American Society of Addiction Medicine Level III facility and the second RTF facility in the DoD and the only facility in the Southern Region Medical Command. ASAM Level III Programs are the highest level of multidisciplinary treatment programs and provide care to the full spectrum of patients with alcohol and substance dependence disorders combined with conditions such as PTSD, Depression, and mild Traumatic Brain Injury.\n\n\n"}

It travels from Bridgeport, West Virginia to Cincinnati, Ohio. It travels US 50 for much of its eastern portion. The western portion of road in Ohio is known as State Route 32. ADHS Funding is separate from other Federal Highway funds.\n\nThe east end of Corridor D begins on US 50 between Clarksburg and Bridgeport, West Virginia, at Interstate 79. US 50 continues on its westerly heading toward Parkersburg and intersects Interstate 77 just outside downtown Parkersburg. The highway continues over the Ohio River on the Blennerhassett Island Bridge.\n\nAfter crossing the Ohio River into Belpre, Ohio, the highway joins with State Route 32 and starts southwest for about then turns northwest for another reaching Athens. The combined US-50/OH-32 makes another turn southwest for about . Then, US 50 and OH-32 diverge. US-50 begins heading west, OH-32, southwest. Corridor D follows OH-32 about to Jackson, where it is intersected by U.S. Route 35. The highway heads due west for about and intersects U.S. Route 23, Corridor C between Portsmouth and Chillicothe. OH-32 continues west for about into Cincinnati, crossing U.S. Route 62, U.S. Route 68 and Interstate 275, Cincinnati's beltway, in the process.\n\nOne of the original 23 corridors, Corridor D (U.S. Highway 50) was to provide access to major urban centers along the east coast from the midwest, while creating economic development for northwest and North-Central West Virginia and southeast Ohio.\n\nThe Blennerhassett Island Bridge, a tied-arch bridge, opened to traffic on June 13, 2008 over the Ohio River thus completing Corridor D in its entirety.\n\nThe earliest segment of Corridor D, or US 50, to open in West Virginia was a six-mile (10 km) segment in 1967 from an isolated point near Sherwood in Doddridge County (MP 15) to WV 23 in Salem in Harrison County (MP 1.52). Two years later, a segment from Salem east to CR 11 at Wolf Summit (MP 7) opened to traffic.\n\nIn 1970, major portions of Corridor D opened to traffic:\n\nMost of Corridor D opened a year later.\n\nIn 1974, a segment of Corridor D in Harrison County opened to traffic from CR 11 at Wolf Summit (MP 7) to the CR 11 at Wilsonburg (MP 11). In 1977, this was extended eastward to WV 20 at Montpelier east of Clarksburg (MP 15.5), and a year later, to Interstate 79 west of Bridgeport (MP 18.25).\n\nConstruction began in 2000 with the start of the Godbey Fields complex in Parkersburg, West Virginia. The $6.5 million athletic complex was finished in 2001. Several contracts were let soon after, which included grading and drainage for part of Corridor D, a new Corning Glass Bridge for WV 47, and another span that would carry US 50 over WV 47 and 7th Street in Parkersburg.\n\nOn September 8, 2003, the first segment of Corridor D opened. The four-lane controlled-access highway stretched from Interstate 77 to WV 47 in Parkersburg.\n\nOn September 20, 2004, the second portion of Corridor D opened from WV 47 to WV 14, which included the construction of a Little Kanawha River crossing. With this segment open to traffic, 1/3 of the Parkersburg Corridor D segment was complete.\n\nOn March 9, 2005, a tied arch Ohio River crossing design was chosen from four designs as it was the \"most economical and least intrusive on the environment of Blennerhassett Island. The $120 million eight-span bridge will include an tied arch over the main channel of the Ohio River and will stretch for from both abutments with a vertical clearance. It is being constructed from weathering steel and will connect WV 892 to OH 618. At the time of its contract letting in April 2005, it was the largest single highway contract in West Virginia's history. The bridge is expected to be complete in 2007.\n\nOn July 12, 2005, it was announced that the final Corridor D contract in West Virginia was to be awarded. This would complete paving and signing operations of from the WV 892, WV 95, and WV 68 interchange to River Hill Road. In Ohio, a single contract was announced that would connect the Ohio River span to U.S. Route 50 which would be completed in 2007.\n\nIn August 2005, Corridor D was opened to traffic from WV 14 to WV 68.\n\nIn mid-September 2005, Corridor D was completed from Fifth Street in Parkersburg to WV 892, WV 95, and WV 68. This segment was constructed under five contracts and required the completion of ten bridges.\n\nAs of April 23, 2006, construction on the Corridor D mainlines from Interstate 77 to WV 892 is all but complete. The last segment, from WV 892 to the WV 892, WV 95, and WV 68 interchange, was slated to open in August.\n\nOn August 31, 2006, it was announced that from WV 892/WV 68 to the WV 892 interchange, Corridor D was open to traffic. This four-lane divided freeway is the final roadway section of the corridor from Clarksburg and Cincinnati without the Ohio River crossing.\n\nThe last Corridor D project, the Blennerhasset Bridge crossing the Ohio River, was opened on June 13, 2008.\n\nThere are long-range plans to expand the diamond interchange at Interstate 77 into a fully directional interchange at a cost of $60 million. It is ranked 75th.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2003999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003999", "title": "Sodom (Final Fight)", "text": "Sodom (Final Fight)\n\nSodom originally appeared in the 1989 beat-em-up game \"Final Fight\", where he is the boss of the Subway stage. An underground wrestling promoter dressed in a samurai-style helmet and gear, Sodom fights the player in an underground ring in the Metro City's subway, wielding two katana swords. In 1993's \"Mighty Final Fight\", there are three Sodoms (or Katanas, as the character is called in the English version), known as the Three Katana Brothers.\n\nSodom's first appearance in the \"Street Fighter\" series was in the original \"Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams\" on 1995. According to Tatsuya Minami, senior manager of Capcom's Product Planning and Design section, Capcom included Sodom in the game because he was popular and easy to translate to the one-on-one fighting genre. In the \"Alpha\" series, he is characterized as an American Japanophile, who is greatly fascinated by Japanese culture but misunderstands it. After being defeated by Guy in \"Final Fight\", Sodom recognizes his wrong perception of Japan and travels there to re-educate himself. He develops a new fighting style based on Japanese and Western martial arts and trades his swords for a pair of jitte. In the first \"Alpha\", he seeks to rebuild the Mad Gear gang by defeating his rival Guy in combat. In his ending, he reforms the gang and holds up a poster reading . In his ending in 1996's \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\", Sodom goes to a sumo ring in Japan to seek new members for the reformed Mad Gear and ends up being challenged by E. Honda. In 1998's \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\", he seeks a new hideout for his gang and goes to claim Shadaloo's new underground base as his own when he learns about it from his former ally Rolento. He crashes his truck into M. Bison's to foil his plot.\n\nApart from the \"Alpha\" series, Sodom appears as a playable character in 1999's \"Final Fight Revenge\" and makes two cameos in 1997's \"Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix\". Sodom makes a cameo in the background of a stage in 2012's \"Street Fighter X Tekken\".\n\nSodom makes a cameo appearance in the 1999 anime film \"\" as a fighter who travels with Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li and some other fighters to Dr. Sadler's laboratory to find and rescue Ryu's alleged younger brother, Shun, though Sodom's comments hint that he is only doing it to prove he is not a coward. As the fighters battle it out to demonstrate their skills to Sadler, Sodom takes on Ken, but is beaten. He and the other fighters are later imprisoned in a cell to have their fighting Ki stripped, but they are released by Ken and Chun-Li.\n\nFor Capcom's 15th anniversary of \"Street Fighter\", SOTA Toys released a series of action figures, amongst which was Sodom. The figure was fully posable with 16 points of articulation, and modeled after his \"Street Fighter Alpha\" appearance.\n\nIn the English-language localization of \"Final Fight\" for the Super NES and Sega CD, Sodom was renamed Katana. The name change was repeated in the SNES version of \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\" to maintain consistency. The initial name change was due to its reference to sodomy, as well as a possible religious reference to Sodom and Gomorrah.\n\nIn the \"Street Fighter Alpha\" games, Sodom is an American character trying to speak Japanese, he is a comedic object of ridicule in his failed attempts at the language. In the Japanese version of \"Street Fighter Alpha\", Sodom's inability to speak fluent Japanese is portrayed in his win quotes by having him use English words that are pronounced similarly to whatever Japanese words he is trying to say with a Japanese translation below.\n\nSodom wears tabi and geta, gauntlets, blue jeans, body armor, and a samurai kabuto with a mask. On the front of his outfit, Sodom has attempted to scrawl the Japanese kanji \"shi\" (死), meaning \"death\". However, he has not written the kanji properly, and thus its meaning is lost. He is never seen fighting without a pair of jitte or katana swords, making him one of the few characters to appear in the \"Street Fighter\" series to use weaponry. In the Japanese version of \"Final Fight\", the katana are named Masamune and Muramasa. In the first two \"Street Fighter Alpha\" games, Sodom uses a pair of jitte as weapons instead of his katana blades from \"Final Fight\". However, in \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\", if the player plays as Sodom in X-ism mode, then Sodom will use his katana blades from \"Final Fight\" instead of the jitte.\n\nSodom was included in the UGO Networks top 50 \"Street Fighter\" characters, as well on its list of fighting games' craziest characters, with a comment: \"\"Street Fighter\" series has seen its share of oddball characters, but few are as goofy as Sodom.\" Doug Perry from IGN called him a \"stupid\" character and asked who would ever play him. \"Complex\" ranked Sodom as the second \"lamest \"Street Fighter\" character\". In the official poll by Namco, Sodom has been the 32nd most requested \"Street Fighter\" side character to be added to the roster of \"Tekken X Street Fighter\", as of August 2012 raking up 3.49% of votes. A fight between Sodom and Yoshimitsu was listed as one of \"12 matchups we want to see in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\"\" by GamesRadar that commented though a \"jerk\", Sodom \"bring some pizzazz to the tired old samurai fashion scene [...] with his 'Samurai Casual' armor and blue jeans.\" Sodom was one of ten absent characters Heavy.com wished to be added in \"Ultra Street Fighter 4\". GameSpy featured Sodom in their list of \"extremely rough brawlers\" at 16th place.\n\n"}
{"id": "2004001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2004001", "title": "Ray Emery", "text": "Ray Emery\n\nRaymond Robert Emery (born Raymond Robert Nichols; September 28, 1982 – July 15, 2018) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for eleven seasons. Emery was chosen 99th overall by the Ottawa Senators in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. During the 2006–07 season, he was a member of the Senators team that reached the Stanley Cup Finals. It was the modern Senators' first appearance in the finals. He won a Stanley Cup championship with the Chicago Blackhawks in 2013.\n\nEmery received numerous awards and accolades. In April 2013, he won the William M. Jennings Trophy along with teammate Corey Crawford, awarded to the goaltender or goaltenders who give up the fewest goals in the season. Emery finished the 2012–13 season with a 1.94 goals against average and a 0.922 save percentage. His seventeen wins included twelve straight to start the year, the best such streak in NHL history. Emery was a two-time Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy finalist for his dedication and perseverance. His teammates and fans often referred to him as \"Razor\" or \"Sugar Ray\" for his aggressive playing style.\n\nEmery was born Raymond Robert Nichols on September 28, 1982 in Hamilton, Ontario. His mother, Sharlene Nichols, was working as an overhead crane operator at a Dofasco steel mill when she became pregnant at 20. His biological father had no interest in staying in a relationship with her or raising a child, and the two had no contact. When he was two years old, his mother met another crane operator, Paul Emery, at a children's skating event. The two married when Ray was four-and-a-half years old and he was shortly after adopted by Paul and took his surname. Emery had two younger brothers, Andrew and Nicholas. The family lived in a century-old farmhouse near the town of Cayuga.\n\nEmery excelled in school, and was offered a scholarship. He played many sports other than ice hockey, including golf, baseball, and soccer. In hockey, he originally played as a defenceman, but switched to goaltender at nine years old due to a shortage of goaltenders in his league.\n\nEmery committed to hockey on the advice of his mother, after a potential scholarship during his pursuit for higher education pushed him to take advantage of his athletic ability. At 16 years old, Emery landed with the Ontario Junior Hockey League Junior C Dunnville Terriers after unsuccessfully trying out for eight different junior teams. Emery was named the league's Rookie of the Year.\n\nThe Ontario Hockey League (OHL)'s Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds drafted Emery in the fifth round of the 1999 OHL Draft. Emery split the 1999–2000 season between the Welland Cougars of the OHA and the Greyhounds in the OHL. In 2000–01, he played with the Greyhounds. During his last season in junior hockey, 2001–02, Emery gained notoriety for his fighting ability. He was named the OHL's Goaltender of the Year, setting a record of 33 wins and a GAA of 2.73.\n\nEmery was selected in the fourth round, 99th overall by the Ottawa Senators in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. In 2002–03, Emery joined the Binghamton Senators of the American Hockey League (AHL) and immediately assumed the position of starting goaltender for his first professional season with the team. He was named to the AHL All-Star team, made the league's all-rookie team and became Binghamton's .\n\nEmery was suspended twice for on-ice incidents in the same season, once for bumping a referee which resulted in a three-game suspension; the second time for an altercation with Denis Hamel of the Rochester Americans who admitted uttering a racial slur. Emery retaliated and was suspended for three games. Emery and Hamel later became teammates in Binghamton, and Hamel apologized \"for not thinking about what was saying, in the heat of a game\".\n\nEmery began his NHL career with the Ottawa Senators in 2005–06. He set a record for wins to start an NHL goaltending career, winning his first nine games, moving ahead of Bob Froese who had won his first eight games in the 1982–83 season. In March of the same season, Emery won twelve games, tying Bernie Parent's 1974 record for the most wins in a month.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Emery had won nine straight games during the regular season as the back-up to Dominik Hašek. When Hašek injured his groin during the 2006 Winter Olympics, Emery became Ottawa's de facto starter, with Mike Morrison, claimed off of waivers from the Edmonton Oilers, as Emery's backup. Emery was the starting goaltender for the rest of the season, leading the Senators to the second round of the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs.\n\nAfter the 2005–06 season, the Senators opted not to bring back Hašek, instead acquiring Martin Gerber to compete with Emery for the starter position. Gerber was the starter at the beginning of the season, but due to his poor play, Emery replaced him in mid-November. On February 10, 2007, Emery was suspended for three games from the NHL for striking Montreal Canadiens forward Maxim Lapierre in the face with his stick after Lapierre crashed into Emery's net.\n\nTwelve days later, after his suspension had ended, Emery was involved in a fight between the Senators and the Buffalo Sabres. He and Sabres goaltender Martin Biron left their creases to fight each other. After this was finished, Sabres enforcer Andrew Peters grabbed Emery and connected with ten hard punches to the head; Emery did not directly punch Peters. Both goaltenders received game misconducts, and Emery had the rare feat (for a goaltender) of receiving two five-minute majors for fighting in the same incident. In total, Emery received 22 penalty minutes (two five-minute majors for fighting, a two-minute minor for leaving the crease and the 10-minute game misconduct) for this altercation. After the altercation, fans and media dubbed him \"Sugar Ray\" in reference to retired boxer Sugar Ray Robinson and Emery's reputation as a fighter. Then-teammate Brian McGrattan opined that if Emery were a position player and not a goalie, he would likely rank among the top five fighters in the NHL.\n\nPrior to the 2007 playoffs, Emery and the Senators won 5–2 against Montreal on March 30, 2007, which was his 100th NHL game. Emery's strong play in the season continued in the playoffs, as the Senators defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins, New Jersey Devils and Buffalo Sabres each in five-game series en route to their first Stanley Cup Final appearance since the team was founded in 1992, where the Senators ultimately lost to the Anaheim Ducks in five games. He became a restricted free agent after the end of the season and filed for salary arbitration, later agreeing to a three-year deal with the Senators worth  million before the hearings were held.\nBy the pre-season of the 2007–08 campaign, Emery had suffered a wrist injury that limited him to just 40 minutes of the pre-season and forced him to miss several games early in the Senators' season. On April 18, 2008, Murray announced to the media in an end-of-season press conference that Emery would not return to the Senators for the 2008–09 season. On June 20, 2008, Emery was waived by the Senators; he cleared waivers three days later and became a free agent as a result.\n\nEmery signed a one-year, $2 million contract with Atlant Moscow Oblast of the newly formed Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on July 9, 2008. After giving up five goals during a game, he chased a trainer who attempted to put a sponsored cap on Emery's head. As a foreign goaltender, Emery was allowed to play in only 65% of his team's 56 regular season games due to rules that encourage the development of Russian goaltenders. He split duties for the season with former Colorado Avalanche goaltender Vitaly Kolesnik and completed the season as a top goaltender in the KHL with a .926 save percentage and a 1.86 GAA.\n\nOn June 10, 2009, the Philadelphia Flyers announced that they had agreed to terms with Emery on a one-year contract worth $1.5 million. On December 8, Emery was placed on injured reserve to have surgery on a torn muscle in his abdomen. Originally expected to miss about six weeks, the prognosis changed when it was discovered that he had avascular necrosis of the hip. In March 2010, Flyers general manager Paul Holmgren announced that Emery would be out for the remainder of the season due to the diagnosis and that a bone graft would be carried out.\n\nDoctors were able to catch the disease before it spread, unlike the case of baseball and American football player Bo Jackson. As a result, in April, doctors announced a successful surgery. Jackson spoke out about Emery, speculating that they were the only two athletes to come back after the disease. Jackson added, \"I take my hat off [to him]. I want him to know I am in his corner. It's a lot of hard work. To come back and play, it takes a very, very special and driven person. He's got a different makeup to want to do all the little things he needs to compete on a professional level.\" Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13 centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take.\n\nOn July 1, Emery became an unrestricted free agent as his injury deemed him unable to play until he recuperated. In August, he was given the go-ahead to begin the grueling and tedious workout and rehabilitation process. In November 2010, TSN visited Emery during an on-ice workout and were surprised to see him get down into the butterfly position and play for the first time since surgery. Emery stated that he did not \"care if [he could] walk in seven years\", and he \"just [wanted] to play\". To the surprise of his doctors and trainers, Emery recovered faster than expected. In January 2011, Emery began skating with an OHL team, taking shots and training with Eric Lindros, and working with personal trainer Matt Nichol and goalie coach Eli Wilson. According to Wilson, Emery was \"as sharp and ready now as he was the summer before Ottawa's Stanley Cup Final run\".\n\nIn March 2011, Emery's injury and undefeated return to the NHL with the Anaheim Ducks garnered much media attention and fascination, with a special segment featured on CBC's \"Hockey Night in Canada\". Emery had 13 centimetres of bone missing from his leg. This later garnered him a nomination for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy.\n\nOn February 7, 2011, four NHL teams showed interest in signing Emery before he signed a one-year two-way contract with the Anaheim Ducks. He was then assigned to the Syracuse Crunch to begin the standard two-week conditioning AHL stint where he went on to play a total of five games for the Crunch in their 2010–11 season, posting a 4–1–0 record, with a 1.98 GAA and a .943 save percentage. On February 23, 2011, upon completion of his conditioning stint, Emery was called up to the Ducks. Emery made his Ducks debut on March 11, 2011, to a standing ovation against the Phoenix Coyotes when he replaced goaltender Dan Ellis. Emery won six straight starts to open his Anaheim career, falling one shy of matching the Ducks' record for consecutive wins by a goaltender, held by Guy Hebert. In the week of March 14, Emery was honoured with the NHL's Second Star of the Week after going 2–0–0 with a 0.99 GAA and a .968 save percentage.\n\nEmery led the Ducks into the playoffs, finishing tied for fourth in the league and posting a 7–2–0 record with 2.28 GAA and .926 save percentage in ten regular-season NHL appearances. In April, Emery's comeback was recognized when the Anaheim chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association (PHWA) nominated Emery for the 2011 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. The NHL also nominated Emery for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, making him one of three finalists.\n\nOn October 3, 2011 Emery signed a one-year contract for the 2011–12 season with the Chicago Blackhawks after a successful try-out. By the end of the season, Emery compiled a 15–9–4 record and a 2.81 GAA in 34 regular-season appearances, posting a 10–0–3 record and a 2.15 GAA in 16 appearances at Chicago's United Center. Emery was again nominated, this time by the Blackhawks, for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, honouring dedication and perseverance. In April 2012, the Blackhawks signed Emery to a one-year extension worth $1.15 million to keep him with the team into the 2012–13 season.\n\nEmery made NHL history in March 2013 by becoming the first goaltender to start a season with ten straight wins, going 10–0–0. He improved his NHL record to eleven straight wins against the Colorado Avalanche on March 18. Emery went to 12–0–0 in a shutout win against the Calgary Flames, in his 200th NHL start. On April 10, he made franchise history by recording his third shutout in five games, helping him to third in the NHL with a 1.90 GAA and seventh in save percentage at .924 with a 15–1–0 record. Emery proved his previous injuries were no longer a concern, posting career highs.\nIn April 2013, Emery and teammate Corey Crawford won the award for the NHL's best combined GAA, the 2013 William M. Jennings Trophy, awarded to the goaltender who gives up the fewest goals in the season. Emery finished the season with a 1.94 GAA, a .922 save percentage, and 17 wins. He won his first Stanley Cup when the Blackhawks defeated the Boston Bruins in the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nOn July 5, 2013, Emery signed a one-year deal with the Philadelphia Flyers worth $1.65 million. With the Flyers, Emery served as the backup to regular goaltender Steve Mason. On November 1, Emery participated in a brawl against the Capitals, fighting opposing goaltender Braden Holtby, who was uninterested in fighting. For the season, he was 9–12–2 with a 2.96 GAA in 28 appearances. On July 1, 2014, he re-signed for another year in the same role for $1 million. In 31 appearances with the Flyers in the 2014–15 season, Emery had a 10–11–7 record and a 3.06 GAA, and his save percentage was under .900.\n\nOn September 8, 2015, the Tampa Bay Lightning announced that Emery would be attending training camp on a PTO (professional tryout). During the preseason he was released from this PTO on September 27. In October and November 2015, Emery trained with the Ontario Reign of the AHL, affiliate to the Los Angeles Kings. It was announced on December 18, 2015, that Emery had signed a professional tryout agreement with the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League (AHL), who are associated with the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nEmery was praised for his leadership and mentoring abilities; on January 24, 2016, upon Crawford recording his league-leading seventh shutout of the season with the Blackhawks after a win against the Blues, he credited Emery for turning around his work habits. Crawford stated that Emery's work habits led him to increase his focus and preparation before a game and during practice. \"As a goalie, I've never seen a guy be so focused and ready for a game\", Crawford said. \"I was kind of doing the opposite – being nonchalant and doing other stuff and not having a routine. You get in that physical routine that just makes you ready mentally. You trick yourself into knowing that it's game time and time to play.\" Kyle Dubas, assistant GM of the Marlies, cited Emery for his mentorship towards the team.\n\nOn February 5, 2016, Emery signed with Adler Mannheim of the German elite league Deutsche Eishockey Liga for the remainder of the season, thus ending his professional tryout with the Marlies. On March 29, he signed a tryout contract with the Flyers, and on April 1, the team announced that it had signed Emery for the remainder of the season. At the end of the season, Emery retired from the NHL.\n\nEmery was a fan favorite and a celebrated fighter in the NHL because it was rare for a goaltender to fight. Emery was a boxing fan and had images of Joe Frazier, Bernard Hopkins, Mike Tyson and the fictional Rocky Balboa on his helmets.\n\nEmery's erratic behavior was the subject of much speculation by the press during his tenure with the Ottawa Senators. Reports concerning Emery included a road rage incident involving a senior citizen, a car accident that led to a missed flight to a road game, lateness to practice, a stick-smashing incident during practice, fights with teammates during practice, and rumored alcohol abuse. In 2008, the media speculated that Emery was involved with a bad crowd and recreational drugs. When asked about this speculation, Emery responded, \"I'm not a saint and I'm not in jail, either.\" At one point, Emery was asked by the team's general manager whether he had a drug problem; Emery responded in the negative. Paddock later expressed regret on how Emery was handled in Ottawa; he was partially responsible for signing Emery to the Flyers, where they worked together from 2013 to 2016.\n\nIn January 2009, a video surfaced of Emery trying to chase and punch a team trainer while the trainer was attempting to place a hat on his head in January 2009. In 2011, Emery stated that he had learned from his past mistakes and that he had undergone anger management classes as well as eight weeks of behavioural counselling.\n\nIn June 2010, Emery began dating Canadian singer Keshia Chanté, and starred as the love interest in Chanté's music video for \"Test Drive\". On June 16, 2016, Emery proposed to Chanté on her birthday in Nassau, Bahamas. Emery and Chanté were set to wed in June 2017; however, simultaneously with the release of her cover on \"Today's Bride\", Chanté announced via her Instagram account that she had called off the wedding. On September 18, 2017, Chanté sought a restraining order against Emery when he was arrested for uttering threats and assault with a weapon towards her. Chanté required Emery to attend anger management in exchange for charges being dropped; Emery successfully completed the classes.\n\nIn March 2007, Emery was charged after a minor crash while heading to the airport; the accident forced him to miss a team-chartered flight to a road game. In September 2007, he had a much-publicized road rage incident with a 65-year-old man; Emery was accused of cutting off the man's vehicle on the highway and threatening to kill him. No charges were laid.\n\nIn February 2008, Ottawa police pulled Emery over. He had allegedly cut off a police cruiser with his Hummer. Police said that he was aggressive with officers. In March 2009, he was charged with stunt driving for allegedly having driven or more over the posted speed limit. Police impounded his Hummer. He appeared on TSN's \"Off the Record with Michael Landsberg\", saying that, at the time, his Hummer had been pulled over at least 30 times.\n\nOn July 15, 2018, Emery went swimming with friends at the Royal Hamilton Yacht Club in Hamilton, Ontario. He jumped off a boat and friends called emergency services at approximately 6:00 am when he did not resurface. His body was found at about 2:50 pm that same day, about from where he went into the water, according to Hamilton Police, who referred to the incident as a \"case of misadventure\". The search for Emery took longer than anticipated due to unspecified safety concerns for the dive team before they could enter the water. An autopsy indicated that Emery had drowned, and police concluded their investigation as \"non-criminal\".\n\nOn July 16, Keshia Chanté penned an emotional tribute to Emery, stating that she was \"heartbroken\" and that he was \"a superhero\" who was \"loving, affectionate, intelligent, hilarious, giving\". She also stated that they \"may have had differences\" but they \"forgave each other and continued to love each other right to the very end.\"\n\nOn October 15, 2018, prior to a game against the Dallas Stars, the Senators presented a tribute for Emery. Among those present were his close friend Jason Spezza, who was playing for the Stars, and Chanté, who sang the national anthems.\n\nStatistics via Eliteprospects\n\n"}

Its area is . The city is the oldest and the first capital of the island of Gran Canaria, founded before 1351, a former medieval bishopric and present Catholic titular see.\n\nThe city Telde is located 4 km from the coast and 16 km south of the island capital Las Palmas. The GC-1 motorway passes east of the city. The Gran Canaria International Airport is located in the subdivision of Gando, south of Telde.\n\nBefore the Spanish invasion Telde was the eastern centre to the aborigines of the island, and the renowned aborigen Doramas is believed to have lived here. Early records point to about 14,000 aborigen dwellings here in Telde at the time of conquest, and Telde is the spot where the famous Idolo de Tara figure—currently housed in the Museo Canario in Las Palmas—was discovered.\n\nIt was created by papal decree is 1351. Today Telde is Gran Canaria's second city with a population over 100,000. The historic old town area of Telde is particularly popular with visitors.\n\nThe Diocese of Islas de la Fortuna (español) / Isola de Fortunate (Italiano) / Insulas Fortunatis (Latin) (meaning 'Fortunate islands', the nickname of the Canaries) was established on 7 November 1351. The territory split off from the Balearic Diocese of Mallorca, as suffragan of the (Andalusian) Metropolitan Archdiocese of Seville.\n\nRenamed in 1369 after its see as Diocese of Telde (Spanish) / Telden(sis) (Latin adjective).\n\nOn 7 July 1404 it lost territory to establish the Diocese of Rubicon.\n\nIn 1441 it was suppressed, without direct successor.\n\n\n\nIn 1969 the diocese was nominally restored as Latin Titular bishopric of Telde (Spanish) / Telden(sis) (Latin adjective).\n\nIt has had the following incumbents, \"none yet of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank :\n\nIn the past, Telde was an agricultural community, the main crops being sugar canes, vineyards, bananas and tomatoes. Today the surrounding area of Telde is quite heavily industrialised, becoming the industrial centre on the island.\n\nTwo airlines are headquartered at Gran Canaria Airport: Binter Canarias and Canaryfly.\n\nThe church San Juan Bautista (John the Baptist) de Telde is the true spiritual centre of Telde. Located in the square of the same name and founded in 1483, the old church was erected by the Garcia del Castillo family at the time of the town's foundation. It still has the original gateway, an example of Sevillian-Portuguese Gothic architecture. The towers, however, are an example of early 20th neo-Gothic construction. The real marvels are inside the building: the statue of Christ on the main altar, made from corn dough by the Purépecha Mexican Indians, brought here before 1550, the Flemish Gothic main altar, which dates back to before 1516, and the triptych of the Virgin Mary, brought from Flanders, also in the 16th century, depicting five religious scenes.\n\nTelde has 101 archaeological sites and 709 listed sites of ethnographic interest. The number of sites increases each year, as do new aspects of old fields, but most are in disrepair and many are disappearing. Some of the most prominent are the coastal town of Tufia, in good condition and extensively excavated by archaeologists; Four Doors (\"Cuatro Puertas\"), a large cave with four doors located on top of a mountain overlooking the plain adjoined to a village of cave houses with collective barn at the back; the caves of Tara and Cendro, remains of the ancient centre of population; the town of Draguillo on the border with Ingenio; \"las cuevas Chalasia\" which consist of a labyrinthine series of artificial caves linked by tunnels; and the impressive necropolis of Jinámar which includes more than 500 tombs of various types.\n\nTelde has a moderate desert climate.\n\nLycée Français René-Verneau, the French international school of Gran Canaria, is located in Telde.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2004010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2004010", "title": "The Book of the New Sun", "text": "The Book of the New Sun\n\nThe Book of the New Sun (1980–1983) is a series of four science fantasy novels, a tetralogy or single four-volume novel written by the American author Gene Wolfe. It inaugurated the so-called \"Solar Cycle\" that Wolfe continued by setting other works in the same universe.\n\nGene Wolfe had originally intended the story to be a 40,000-word novella called \"The Feast of Saint Catherine\", meant to be published in one of the \"Orbit\" anthologies, but during the writing it continued to grow. Despite being published with a year between each book, all four books were written and completed during his free time without anyone's knowledge when he was still an editor of \"Plant Engineering\", allowing him to write at his own pace and take his time.\n\nThe tetralogy chronicles the journey of Severian, a journeyman torturer who is disgraced and forced to wander. It is a first-person narrative, ostensibly translated by Wolfe into contemporary English, set in a distant future when the Sun has dimmed and Earth is cooler (a \"Dying Earth\" story). Severian lives in a nation called the Commonwealth, ruled by the Autarch, in the Southern Hemisphere. It is at war with Ascia, its northern neighbor, which is extremely totalitarian. In the ocean are mountain-sized aliens that want to enslave humanity and have succeeded in controlling Ascia.\n\nIn 1998, \"Locus\" magazine ranked the tetralogy number three among 36 all-time best fantasy novels before 1990, based on a poll of subscribers.\n\nSeverian, an apprentice in the torturers' guild, barely survives a swim in the River Gyoll. On his way back to the Citadel (whose towers appear to be disused rockets), Severian and several other apprentices sneak into a necropolis where Severian first encounters Vodalus, an aristocrat who is the Commonwealth's leading revolutionary. Vodalus, along with a noblewoman named Thea and a servant named Hildegrin, are robbing a grave. Vodalus and his companions are attacked by volunteer guards. Severian saves Vodalus's life, earning his trust and the reward of a single \"gold\" coin.\n\nLater Severian rescues a fighting dog that has lost a leg and names him Triskele. When Triskele leaves, Severian tracks him to a place in the Citadel called the Atrium of Time, where he talks with a beautiful young woman, Valeria, but he does not get Triskele back.\n\nIn the torturers' tower, Severian falls in love with Thecla, a prisoner. She is Thea's half-sister, and it is implied that the Autarch (ruler of the Commonwealth) has imprisoned her to use her to capture Vodalus. Severian's attraction to her is hastened by his sexual initiation in a visit to a brothel at the guild's expense. The brothel is run by a eunuch and the prostitutes are clones of noblewomen; Severian chooses the clone of Thecla for his encounter.\n\nShortly after Severian is elevated to journeyman, Thecla is tortured with a machine that makes her uncontrollably suicidal so she will mutilate herself to death with her bare hands. Severian smuggles a knife into her cell. By thus letting her shorten the time of her suffering, he has broken his oath to the guild.\n\nSeverian expects to be tortured and executed. Instead the head of the guild is uncharacteristically forgiving and dispatches him to Thrax, a distant city which needs an executioner, also giving him Terminus Est, a magnificent executioner's sword. Severian travels through the decaying city of Nessus. He meets the hulking Baldanders and his companion Dr. Talos, traveling as mountebanks, who invite Severian to join them in a play to be performed the same day. During breakfast, Dr. Talos recruits the waitress for his play with a promise to make her beautiful. Instead of participating, Severian parts with the group and stops at a rag shop to purchase a mantle to hide his guild uniform (a cloak and breeches of fuligin, \"the hue that is darker than black\", which inspires terror in common folk; when working he also wears a fuligin mask). The shop is owned by a twin brother and sister, and the brother immediately takes an interest in Terminus Est. Severian refuses to sell the sword, shortly after which a masked and armored hipparch enters the shop and challenges Severian to a duel. Severian is forced to accept, and he goes with the sister, Agia, to secure an avern, a deadly plant that is used for dueling. He becomes strongly attracted to Agia and develops complicated feelings toward her. While on their way in a carriage, they race with the riders in a passing fiacre, and they crash into and destroy the altar of a female religious order, the Pelerines. The Pelerines accuse Agia of stealing a precious relic called the Claw of the Conciliator. After Agia is searched and released, she and Severian continue their journey to the Botanic Gardens, a large landmark of Nessus created by the mysterious Father Inire, right hand to the Autarch.\n\nInside the gardens, Severian falls into a lake used to inter the dead and is pulled out by a young woman named Dorcas who also seems to have come up from the lake. Dazed and confused, Dorcas follows Severian and Agia. Severian acquires the avern and the group proceeds to an inn near the dueling grounds. While eating dinner, Severian receives a mysterious note intended for one of the women, warning her the other is dangerous, but it's not immediately clear which is which. He meets his challenger, and though stabbed by the avern he miraculously survives and finds that his challenger was Agia's brother. When Severian wakes again, he finds himself in a lazaret. After finding Dorcas, who he is falling in love with, and identifying himself as a torturer, he is requested to perform an execution. The prisoner turns out to be Agia's brother, who had provoked the duel expecting to win, when he could claim Terminus Est. Severian executes the brother.\n\nSeverian and Dorcas return to their travels. In his belongings, Severian finds the Claw of the Conciliator, a large glowing gem. Apparently Agia stole the Claw from the altar they destroyed, and knowing that she would be searched, placed it in Severian's belongings. Eventually Severian and Dorcas encounter Dr. Talos, Baldanders and a beautiful woman named Jolenta. Severian takes part in the play they perform, and the next day the group sets out toward the great gate leading out of Nessus. There Severian befriends a man named Jonas who is obviously attracted to Jolenta. The first volume ends with a riot or disturbance at the gate, whose nature is not immediately clear, separating Severian and Jonas from the rest of the group.\n\nThe story continues shortly after the previous installment left off. Now in the nearby town of Saltus, Severian and Jonas delay their search for the others as Severian has been hired to practice his art of execution on two people. The first was a servant of Vodalus. As the man is dragged out of his home by a mob, Severian glimpses Agia amidst the crowd. Agia flees and Severian, still attracted to and hoping to reconcile with her, follows, searching for her at the town fair. Unable to find her, he consults a green-skinned man whose master offers his services as an attraction, claiming he can answer any question. In answer to Severian's queries as to how he could know everything, the green man tells Severian he is from the future (where the sun is bright and people have photosynthetic organisms in their skin). The green man does not know where Agia can be found, but Severian takes pity on him and gives him a piece of his whetstone so that he can free himself by grinding through his chains. Severian returns to town and executes the two prisoners.\n\nEating dinner with his friend Jonas that evening, he finds a letter that seems to be from Thecla (but is actually from Agia) asking him to meet her at a nearby cave. In the cave, Severian barely escapes a group of man-ape miners. The light from the Claw stops the man-apes' attack, but it also seems to wake a gigantic unknown creature deep below in the cave, which is only heard and not seen. Severian escapes, only to be attacked by Agia and her assassins outside the cave. One of the attackers is killed by one of the man-apes, who had his hand cut off by Severian in the battle in the cave. The ape gestures its stump at Severian, wanting him to do something with it, but Severian does not know what. Severian prepares to behead Agia, but still unable to hate her, lets her go. He returns to Saltus, where he and Jonas are captured by Vodalus's rebels for executing one of its members.\n\nSeverian recalls to Vodalus that he saved his life some years past, so Vodalus allows Severian to enter his service. Severian and Jonas attend a midnight dinner with Vodalus, where they eat Thecla's roasted flesh, which, when combined with a substance from an alien creature called an alzabo, lets the eaters experience her memories. For Severian the experience is permanent; Thecla lives again in his mind. Given the task of delivering a message to a servant in the House Absolute, the Autarch's seat of power, Severian and Jonas set off to the north. They are attacked by a flying creature that feeds on the heat and life force of living beings and escape only by tricking the creature into attacking and killing a nearby soldier instead. Severian feels guilty and, having come to suspect the Claw has healing powers, uses it to bring the soldier back to life. He and Jonas are captured by guards of the House Absolute and thrown into an antechamber where prisoners are held indefinitely. Severian's Claw heals a wound Jonas receives during the night they spend there; then the pair escapes some unknown horrible creature by using a pass-phrase drawn from Thecla's memories to open a secret door. As they walk the corridors of the House Absolute, Jonas is revealed to be a robot who once crash-landed on earth and has been repaired with human parts as prosthetics. He steps into a mirror and disappears, promising to return for Jolenta when he is healed. Severian is lost and eventually encounters Vodalus's spy, who is the androgynous brothel-keeper. After the androgyne opens and then closes a portal to someplace with a giant winged alien, Severian swears service to him. In the subsequent conversation he realizes that the supposed spy is the Autarch.\n\nStumbling into the gardens of the House Absolute, Severian is reunited with Dorcas, Dr. Talos, and Baldanders, who are preparing to perform the play they performed in the first book. Severian participates again, but the play is cut short when Baldanders flies into a rage and attacks the audience, revealing that aliens are among them. Talos and Baldanders part ways with Severian and Dorcas at a crossroad, Severian heading toward Thrax, and the giant and his physician headed toward Lake Diuturna. Jolenta tries to have Talos take her with him, but he has no more use for her now that the plays are no longer necessary, and Severian takes her. As they head north, Jolenta is bitten by a \"blood bat\" and falls ill. Severian realizes that she had been scientifically altered by Dr. Talos to be gorgeous and desirable, but is quickly becoming sickly and unattractive. Soon the trio meets an old farmer who tells them they must pass through an enigmatic stone city to get to Thrax. In the ruined city, Severian sees a pair of witches initiate a dream-like event in which ghostly dancers of the stone town's past, led in a ritual by a teacher named Apu-Punchau, fill the area and fight with the witch's servant, who is Vodalus's lieutenant Hildegrin. The book ends with Dorcas and Severian emerging from a stupor in the stone town, Jolenta dead and revealed to be the waitress whom Dr. Talos had promised to make beautiful, and the witches and Hildegrin gone.\n\nSeverian takes up his position as the Lictor of the city of Thrax. His lover Dorcas falls into depression, in part because of her position as the partner of a reviled and feared figure in a strange city. She is also becoming increasingly upset by her inability to remember her past and convinced that she must unravel its secrets, however disturbing they may turn out to be.\n\nAfter escaping an exotic creature that incinerates things, which seems to have come to Thrax to find him, Severian again shows mercy to a woman he had had sex with—she was to be executed for adultery—and must flee the city. He journeys alone into the mountains in search of the Pelerines so that he can return the Claw of the Conciliator.\n\nOn the road, he battles Agia and an alzabo, a beast which acquires the memories of those it eats, as well as a gang of men who have opted to become as animals. He takes a boy also named Severian, whose family was killed by the alzabo, into his care. They encounter a village of men who claim to be sorcerers and possess more power than Severian at first believes, but they escape amidst the threat of yet another dangerous creature set upon his trail. While exploring an ancient mountain stronghold in search of sustenance or something of value, Severian and little Severian climb to a gold ring on the finger of a monolithic statue carved into the mountainside. When little Severian touches the ring he is blasted by heat and immediately perishes. On his way back down, a suicidal Severian inadvertently revives a monarch from the past, Typhon, who was in suspended animation. Typhon tries to dominate Severian with physical threats, psychological manipulation, and something like hypnosis, but Severian finds a way to kill him. \n\nContinuing his journey to the great Lake Diuturna, Severian is drawn into a local conflict on the side of a group of islanders being enslaved. He discovers that his old companions Dr. Talos and Baldanders are the oppressors. Severian makes his way through their lakeside castle, discovering that Baldanders is an inventor and scientist who conducts experiments on people, and in fact created his own homunculus in the form of Dr. Talos. Severian encounters the otherworldly hierodules within, who unexpectedly prostrate themselves in front of him. Severian then battles the giant Baldanders. He barely survives, while Baldanders vanishes in the lake. Severian's sword is destroyed in the battle, as well as the Claw. Down at the shore he finds a curved thorn that he believes is the true claw that was set in the now-shattered stone.\n\nIn the wake of this battle, Severian seeks to digest a series of revelations: about the nature of Baldanders, the nature of the aliens (including Father Inire and the older witch in the stone town) who manipulate events on Urth and profess to be his friends, and the nature of the Claw he carried for so long. As he does so, he finds himself approaching the edge of the war in the North.\n\nWandering around, Severian happens upon a dead soldier, whom he revives with the Claw, and they make their way to the Pelerines' camp. In the camp, Severian suffers a fever and is treated along with people injured in the war. While recovering, Severian judges a story-telling contest held by fellow patients. He returns the Claw by putting it in an altar. A leader of the Pelerines tasks him to bring a friend of theirs in the mountains away from the danger of the war to the safety of the camp. The man, a time traveler from a future where the world is covered in ice, refuses to come with Severian, and when Severian leads him away by force, the man disappears, as he does not belong in Severian's time. Upon returning to the camp, Severian discovers it has been attacked and abandoned. He soon finds the new camp, where most of those he met during his stay are dead or dying.\n\nSeverian is drawn into the war against Ascia. He nearly perishes in battle but is rescued by the Autarch. Severian is nursed back to health and converses with the Autarch about his role in the Commonwealth. Taking a flier over the war zone, they are shot down. The Autarch, dying, tells Severian to drink the contents of a vial around the Autarch's neck and eat his brain, as Severian is to be the next Autarch. Severian does so, and since the vial contained the alzabo drug or something similar, he acquires hundreds of consciousnesses that the Autarch had through the same process.\n\nBefore the Autarch died, he sent a message to Vodalus that the Autarch was aboard the flier. Thea and a group of Vodalus's men descend on the crash site and rescue Severian from their allies the Ascians. Severian is held prisoner and is visited by Agia in company with a former spacefarer who calls from other planets the creatures that have been attacking Severian. Agia attempts to kill Severian again, but he survives and is rescued by the green time traveler whom he rescued in \"The Claw of the Conciliator\". The green man opens a passage through time in which Severian is visited by an alien who takes the form of Master Malrubius, a torturer who had died in Severian's boyhood, accompanied by the dog Triskele. \"Malrubius\" tells him that he must one day face a challenge that will either create a New Sun and allow humanity to return to the stars if he succeeds, or strip him of his manhood, leaving him unable to produce an heir, if he fails. Severian realizes that the last Autarch must have failed and thus become an androgyne.\n\nAfter the meeting, Severian is left on a beach where many wild rosebushes are in bloom. He is pricked by a thorn and realizes that it is identical to the Claw, even to glowing. Seeing that and countless identical Claws on other bushes leads him to a religious experience. He also ponders the meaning of the Claw, higher beings such as the alien who appeared as Malrubius, time travel, and the New Sun. In an interlude at the time of writing the book, he says that he is on his way to the test.\n\nSeverian makes his way back to Nessus aboard a ship whose crewmen revere him on sight. In a long-abandoned part of Nessus he finds Dorcas in her old house but leaves without making himself known to her. He visits other people of his past, assumes the role of Autarch, and suspends the practice of torture. Finding the gold coin Vodalus had given him, he realizes it was counterfeit. He returns to the waiter who slipped him the note in \"The Shadow of the Torturer\". The note was meant for Dorcas, who reminded the waiter of his mother. A picture of Dorcas in a locket around the waiter's neck confirms this suspicion. It is implied that the waiter is Severian's father. Dorcas had died long before, and though Severian did not yet know he had the Claw, it brought her back to life in the lake.\n\nThe book ends with Severian exploring the Citadel and retracing Triskele's steps through an underground building. He follows his own tracks, returning to the Atrium of Time and Valeria.\n\nSeverian, the main character and narrator to the series, can be interpreted as a Christ figure. His life has many parallels to the life of Jesus, and Gene Wolfe, a Catholic, has explained that he deliberately mirrored Jesus in Severian. He compares Severian's profession as a torturer to Jesus's profession as a carpenter in \"The Castle of the Otter\":\nSeverian's life parallels Jesus' occasionally, with his descent into the cave of the man-apes being a Harrowing of Hell scene, his resurrection of Declan being a Lazarus of Bethany scene, and his friendship with Jonas reflecting Ahasuerus. Jonas has traveled the world looking to reconnect with the Hierodules, \"tinkers with clumsy mechanisms\", and is redeemed from wandering exile after befriending Severian. In this respect he represents the wandering Jew. Severian also suffers from occasional seemingly random bleeding from his forehead, as if from a crown of thorns. Also mirroring the crown of thorns, the Claw of the Conciliator, a thorn that causes Severian to shed blood, becomes a religious relic due to its relation to Severian. Terminus Est represents his crucifix, with Severian describing his sword in \"Urth of the New Sun\" as a \"dark cross upon my shoulder.\" In the following volume, \"The Urth of the New Sun\", Severian is resurrected as well, escaping to a Heaven-like plane of existence where an angel resides and then emerging from a stone tomb, as Jesus rose from his stone tomb.\n\nHowever, Wolfe said in an interview, \"I don't think of Severian as being a Christ figure; I think of Severian as being a Christian figure. He is a man who has been born into a very perverse background, who is gradually trying to become better.\"\n\nDuring the years when \"The Book of the New Sun\" was published, Wolfe published two stories from it separately: \"Foila's Story: The Armiger's Daughter\" (one of the entries in the story-telling contest in the Pelerines' hospital) and \"The Tale of the Student and his Son\" (one of the two stories that Severian reproduces from a book he obtained for Thecla when she was imprisoned).\n\nShortly after \"The Citadel of the Autarch\", Wolfe published \"The Castle of the Otter\", a book of essays about \"The Book of the New Sun\" containing a few fictional elements, such as jokes told by some of the characters.\n\nAfter the original four-volume novel, Wolfe wrote a novel often called a coda, \"The Urth of the New Sun\" (1987). He also wrote three short stories, \"The Map\", \"The Cat\", and \"Empires of Foliage and Flower\", that are closely related to \"The Book of the New Sun\".\n\nLater he wrote two book series that are set in Severian's universe. The Internet Speculative Fiction Database catalogues it all as the \"Solar Cycle\", comprising the short works and three sub-series. The two later subseries are \"The Book of the Long Sun\" (1993–1996, four volumes) and \"The Book of the Short Sun\" (1999–2001, three volumes). \"Long Sun\" is set on a generation ship and \"Short Sun\" features the inhabitants of that generation ship after their long journey. Two of the \"Long Sun\" books were nominated for Nebula Awards.\n\n\"The Book of the New Sun\" belongs to the Dying Earth subgenre of speculative fiction. Peter Wright calls the series an \"apotheosis\" of traditional Dying Earth elements and themes, and Douglas Barbour suggests that the book is a foundational mosaic of that literary heritage: Traces of this literary tradition can be found throughout the book. In \"The Sword of the Lictor\", Cyriaca (the woman whom Severian spares in Thrax) tells Severian a legend about an automated city, with rebirth as a central theme. This mirrors John W. Campbell's \"Twilight\", where sentient machines remove the need for human labor. Wolfe himself said that when he was a teenager \"Twilight\" had a great effect on his writing, and this homage to that story is not just a passing reference, but an allusion to a literary predecessor. Later in the story, Wolfe alludes to \"The Time Machine\", with the scene where Severian meets the glowing man-apes mirroring the Time Traveler's confrontation with the Morlocks. In both stories the protagonist holds up a light to awe the cave peoples, but in the \"Book of the New Sun\" Severian relates to the humanity of the man-apes with the glowing Claw of the Conciliator, while in \"The Time Machine\" the Time Traveler intimidates the Morlocks with his fire.\n\nThe tetralogy was first published in English in the United Kingdom by Sidgwick & Jackson from 1980 to 1983, and the coda published in 1987, with second publications for each book occurring approximately a year after the first. Don Maitz illustrated the cover of the first publication, and Bruce Pennington illustrated the second cover. The series was also published in two volumes, named \"Shadow and Claw\" and \"Sword and Citadel\", both published in 1994 by Orb Publications.\n\nIt was published as a single volume titled \"The Book of the New Sun\" in 1998 by Science Fiction Book Club and again in 2007 under the title \"Severian of the Guild\", published by Orion Publishing Group.\n\nEach book has been separately translated into French, German, Dutch, and Japanese.\n\nThe Japanese printings of the tetralogy and coda were illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano.\n\nEach of the four original volumes won at least one major fantasy or science fiction award as the year's \"Best Novel\" as shown by the table below. The tetralogy was not considered as a whole for any of the annual literary awards compiled by the Internet Speculative Fiction Database (ISFDB).\n\nGene Wolfe uses a variety of archaic and obscure terms throughout the series, and in the appendix of \"The Shadow of the Torturer\" he explains his fictitious method:\n\nWolfe admitted, however, that some mistakes may have been made in spelling or exact meaning. His unusual words often come from an English–Latin dictionary or an English–Greek dictionary, where he finds roots of words to use.\n\nWolfe stated that he uses strange and arcane words because he \"thought they were the best for the story [he] was trying to tell.\" Language is Wolfe's medium as a writer, and he wishes to \"press against the limits of prose.\" Wolfe's deliberate use of exotic words is meant to manipulate the reader and force upon them a certain visualization of the story, but he does not mean to confuse the reader. He compares the narrator, Severian, and the reader to an English-speaking person and a German-speaking person building a boat:\nTwo examples of the arcane words Wolfe uses are \"Ascian\" and \"Hydrargyrum\". Ascian, despite its similarity to \"Asian\", is derived from a Latin word meaning \"without shadow\", as the Ascians are tropic dwellers who have no shadow at noon. Hydrargyrum, the fluid contained in Severian's sword Terminus Est, is derived from the Ancient Greek \"ὕδωρ\", meaning water, and \"ἄργυρος\", meaning silver, as hydrargyrum is liquid mercury.\n\nThe Ascian language further expounds on the idea that word choice alters the thinking of people, as the Ascian language is simply a set of quotations from government propaganda called \"Correct Thought\". In order to communicate, Ascians must memorize many quotations and learn to interpret others' use of them. This government regulation of language directly regulates the thought of Ascians.\n\n\n"}

From 2005 to 2017, SIM Group established and managed SIM University (UniSIM).\n\nSIM Global Education (SIM GE) a private education institute. It offers diploma, Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes with universities from Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States. The institution has 19,000 students with about 20% being full-time international students from over 40 countries. The institute offers both full-time and part-time programmes.\n\nIn 2018, SIM opened its first overseas representative office in Indonesia, Jakarta to cultivate awareness of its offered programmes under the SIM GE brand in Indonesia.\n\nIn 2018, SIM GE and SGTech signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The MOU offers internship and job opportunities from among SGTech's member companies in the technology sector. SGTech will also engage industry professionals to mentor SIM GE students.\n\nSIM reported that in 2016, 82.7 per cent of its graduates found jobs within six months after graduation. Among the total, 18.8 per cent of graduates were doing flexible work such as freelance, part-time or contract basis jobs. The median gross monthly salary of SIM graduates in 2015 and 2016 were at $2,700.\n\nIn 2017, SIM International Academy will open its doors to offer Secondary 1 to 4 classes, leading to an International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), the equivalent of O levels.\n\nSIM Professional Development programmes train more than 14,000 professionals annually through its 800 seminars, workshops and conferences. Its in-company training and consultancy services help companies optimize effectiveness in management and human resource development fields. \n\nSIM University (UniSIM) was publicity funded private university in Singapore approved by the Ministry of Education. Its enrolment was close to 10,000 students.\n\nIn 2017, UniSIM was restructured into the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) and became Singapore's sixth autonomous university under the ambit of the Ministry of Education (MOE). It is no longer a member of the Singapore Institute of Management Group (SIM).\n\nThe Singapore Institute of Management has four campuses across the west side of Singapore, making it the largest private education campus. The four campuses cover a total land area of 97,000 sqm.\n\nThe SIM HQ Campus, located at 461 Clementi Road, Singapore 599491 was officially opened in 2001 by Dr. Tony Tan, then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence. It houses lecture theatres, tutorial and seminar rooms, computer laboratories, two cafeterias, a multi-purpose hall that can seat up to 1,600 people and a management library. The majority of SIM programmes and student activities are held there.\n\nOther facilities include automated teller machines, AXS machine, SingPost S.A.M self-service machine, and a postal box service. 220 carpark lots are available at the basement and other surface car parks in SIM HQ Campus.\n\nThe SIM Management House at 41 Namly Avenue, Singapore 267616. It serves as the primary location for membership activities as well as short-term training workshops and seminars. It was opened in 1989 by Dr. Richard Hu, then Minister for Finance, and sits on a gross land area of about 10,000 sqm on a 99-year lease from Hwa Chong Institution. It includes 20 lecture theatres, function/seminar rooms, computer laboratories, a members' lounge, cafeteria, business center, bookshop, and library.\n\nSIM has announced a Master Plan to further expand its Clementi campus at a platform topping up ceremony on October 9, 2009.\n\nThe SIM Campus Development Master Plan which will cost $300 million and is expected to be completed by 2014 will be rolled out in two phases. It will render an additional 56,000 square meters of space, more than double its current campus, thus consolidating its position as the largest private tertiary institution in Singapore, both in terms of total campus size and student enrolment.\n\nThe extended campus will cater primarily to the growing needs of the SIM University (UniSIM). As the only private university recognized by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to award its own degrees, UniSIM caters to the tertiary education and lifelong learning needs of working adults. Offering over 40 programmes from four schools, its graduate and post-graduate degree programmes offered through a flexible mode of study are used by working adults who are looking for higher qualifications, career advancement or self-fulfillment.\n\nWith the added incentive of a MOE subsidy of up to 40% for its students introduced in 2008, UniSIM has seen a substantial jump in its enrolment. It now has some 10,000 students, compared to 8,000 in 2007. This number is expected to grow by another 40% to 14,000 by 2020. UniSIM caps its annual intake to only about half of applications received due to limited facilities.\n\n"}
{"id": "2004017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2004017", "title": "Philip H. Lathrop", "text": "Philip H. Lathrop\n\nPhilip H. Lathrop, A.S.C. (October 22, 1912 – April 12, 1995) was an American cinematographer noted for his skills with wide screen technology and detailed approach to lighting and camera placement. He spent most of his life in movie studios. Lathrop was known for such films as \"Touch of Evil\" (1958), \"Lonely Are the Brave\" (1962), \"The Americanization of Emily\" (1964), \"The Cincinnati Kid\" (1965), \"Point Blank\" (1967), \"Finian's Rainbow\" (1968), \"The Traveling Executioner\" (1970), \"Portnoy's Complaint\" (1972), \"Earthquake\" (1974), \"Swashbuckler (1976)\", \"The Driver\" (1978), \"Moment by Moment\" (1978), \"A Change of Seasons\" (1980), \"Foolin' Around\" (1980), \"Loving Couples\" (1980), and \"Deadly Friend\" (1986).\n\nHe was a long-time member of the ASC Board of Directors, as well as co-chairman of the ASC Awards committee. He also participated in the affairs of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.\n\nLathrop was born in Merced, California on October 22, 1912. As a child, the Universal Studios lot was his playground, where his mother was employed in the film lab. Lathrop became a member there in the camera department at 18-years old. There, he watched Gilbert Warrenton, ASC, photograph the first version of \"Show Boat\" in 1928-29. On the 1936 version of the film, Lathrop loaded cameras from John Mescall, ASC.\n\nLathrop had two marriages, to Molly Lathrop and Betty Jo Lathrop, and three sons, Larry, Bill and Clark.\n\nLathrop began his career as a film loader in Universal’s camera department in 1934 for Russell Metty, ASC, on the Irving Reis film, \"All My Sons\".\n\nIn 1938, he became assistant to Universal’s top-ranking cinematographer Joseph A. Valentine, ASC, and worked on the Deanna Durbin pictures, \"The Wolf Man\", and two Alfred Hitchcock classics, \"Saboteur\" and \"Shadow of a Doubt\". Later, he once again worked as a camera operator with Russell Metty for nine years where he shot the opening of Orson Welles’ \"Touch of Evil\", one of the most renowned boom shots in the history of cinema.\n\nLathrop becomes director of photography at Universal in 1958. His first feature that year was \"The Perfect Furlough\", which was shot in CinemaScope and Eastman Color, with director Blake Edwards who Lathrop also worked with on \"Experiment in Terror\", \"Days of Wine and Roses\", and \"The Pink Panther\". In 1959, Lathrop and Edwards collaborated on the television series, \"Peter Gunn\" and \"Mr. Lucky\".\n\nUsing the new Panavision lenses, Lathrop shot the 1962 black and white drama, \"Lonely Are the Brave\", with director David Miller in New Mexico’s Sandia Mountains—this is an early example of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Lathrop’s particular visual style seems to epitomize the times, such as in \"Point Blank\", directed by John Boorman in 1967, where a glossy, dense feel was utilized to a tough thriller. In this film, color charts were prepared for each scene—the colors were subdued and desaturated and no scene was ever too bright or showy. After \"Point Blank\", Lathrop worked on Francis Ford Coppola’s \"Finian’s Rainbow\", another unusual color film.\n\nHe was inducted into the ASC Hall of Fame in 1974. During the 1980s, Lathrop worked on eight television movies-of-the-week as well as several mini-series, winning him several Emmys.\n\nHe died of cancer on April 12, 1995 in Los Angeles, the same year he was honored with the 1992 ASC Lifetime Achievement Award. Services were held at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Hollywood Hills where Stanley Cortez, ASC, delivered the eulogy.\n\nIn the 1974 disaster film \"Earthquake\", Lathrop made director Mark Robson’s vision of the movie come true. Robson wanted a natural look for the film, without its being documentary-like. Instead of shooting in natural locations, \"Earthquake\" was filmed almost entirely on the Universal Studios' sound stages and back-lot due to the extraordinary degree of control deemed necessary to execute the required special effects. To bring the earthquake scenes to life, a shaker mount for the camera was created. Lathrop said it “created an amazing illusion. You’d swear that the ground was going up and down and moving sideways, when, of course, it wasn’t moving at all.” Sets were also built on shaker platforms, which is incredibly costly so “in the sets that were not on shaker platforms, [it] was [difficult] to get the actors to move as if they were responding to an earthquake, when there wasn’t one,” he added.\n\nA five-story section of what is supposed to be a 25-story building was made in Stage 12, the highest in the studio, where every floor was used to shoot the action. Lathrop stated that “it was necessary to dig down 20 feet into the floor of the stage in order to accommodate [the building model].” He continued, “[the] photography of this sequence was difficult because of the way [they] had to light the set” to avoid shadows from the hanging lights when the simulated earthquakes took place. So “in order to light it, [Lathrop] went clear up above the grids with four arcs pointed down to simulate the angle of the sun. [He] matched each of the arcs on the way down and didn’t overlap them, nor did [he] use any fill light at all.” \n\nTo execute a film like \"Earthquake\", natural sets would have been very limiting. Shooting on set allows for control in the lighting and to “do things with the camera that would have been impossible in a natural set,” said Lathrop. Without a single day off of work after \"Earthquake\", Lathrop immediately began working on \"Airport 1975\", also for Universal Studios.\n\n• 1965 - Best Cinematography, Black-and-White - \"The Americanization of Emily\"<br>\n• 1975 - Best Cinematography - \"Earthquake\"\n\n• 1984 – Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited Series or a Special – \"Celebrity\", nominated<br>\n• 1985 – Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited Series or a Special – \"Malice in Wonderland\", won<br>\n• 1986 – Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited Miniseries or a Special – \"Picking Up the Pieces\", nominated<br>\n• 1987 – Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited Miniseries or a Special – \"Christmas Snow\", won<br>\n• 1988 – Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited Miniseries or a Special – \"Little Girl Lost\", nominated\n• 1988 – Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Miniseries or Specials – \"Christmas Snow\", won<br>\n• 1989 – Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Movies of the Week/Pilots – \"Little Girl Lost\", won<br>\n• 1992 – Lifetime Achievement Award, won\n• 1999 – Historical Shot – \"Touch of Evil\", won\n\n• \"Live Fast, Die Young\" (1958)<br>\n• \"Girls on the Loose\" (1958)<br>\n• The Saga of Hemp Brown (1958) as Philip Lathrop<br>\n• \"Wild Heritage\" (1958) as Philip Lathrop<br>\n• \"The Perfect Furlough\" (1958) as Philip Lathrop<br>\n• \"Money, Women and Guns\" (1958) as Philip Lathrop<br>\n• \"Rawhide\" (TV Series: 9 episodes, 1958) as Philip Lathrop<br>\n• \"The Monster of Piedras Blancas\" (1958) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Steve Canyon\" (TV Series: 11 episodes, 1959)<br>\n• \"Cry Tough\" (1959)<br>\n• \"Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color\" (TV Series: 2 episodes, 1959) as Philip Lathrop<br>\n• \"The Private Lives of Adam and Eve\" (1960)<br>\n• \"Mr. Lucky\" (TV Series: 4 episodes, 1960; 21 episodes, 1959-1960) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Peter Gunn\" (TV Series: 61 episodes, 1958-1960) as Philip Lathrop<br>\n• \"Hong Kong\" (TV Series: 24 episodes, 1960-1961) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Perry Mason\" (TV Series: 2 episodes, 1961) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Breakfast at Tiffany’s\" (1961) co-cinematographer, uncredited<br>\n• \"Experiment in Terror\" (1962) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Lonely Are the Brave\" (1962) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Combat!\" (TV Series: 1 episode, 1962) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Days of Wine and Roses\" (1962) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Dime with a Halo\" (1963)<br>\n• \"Vacation Playhouse\" (TV Series: 1 episode, 1963) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Twilight of Honor\" (1963) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Soldier in the Rain\" (1963) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"The Americanization of Emily\" (1964) as Philip Lathrop<br>\n• \"36 Hours\" (1964)<br>\n• \"Girl Happy\" (1965) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"The Cincinnati Kid\" (1965) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Never Too Late\" (1965) as Philip Lathrop<br>\n• \"What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?\" (1966) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"The Happening\" (1967) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Don't Make Waves\" (1967)<br>\n• \"Gunn\" (1967) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"Point Blank\" (1967) Director of Photography<br>\n• \"I Love You, Alice B.

{"id": "2004030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2004030", "title": "Graham Dilley", "text": "Graham Dilley\n\nGraham Roy Dilley (18 May 1959 – 5 October 2011) was an English cricketer, whose main role was as a fast bowler. He played first-class cricket for Kent and Worcestershire, and appeared in 41 Test matches and 36 ODIs for England. He is perhaps best remembered for his tail-end batting with Ian Botham in England's second innings against Australia at Headingley in 1981, reaching his highest Test score of 56 in an eighth-wicket partnership of 117 in 80 minutes. This helped England to win despite their following-on and being quoted as 500–1 outsiders.\n\nCricket correspondent Colin Bateman, commenting on his effectiveness, noted, \"... when it all worked, it worked beautifully\".\n\nDilley was born and raised in Dartford, Kent, England, attended Dartford High School, and played his early cricket for Dartford Cricket Club at Hesketh Park. He trained as a diamond cutter in Hatton Garden before embarking on a cricketing career with Kent County Cricket Club. He played for the Kent Second XI in 1976, aged 17.\n\nHe was married and divorced twice. Kent cricketer Graham Johnson was a brother-in-law. He had four children, including Chris Pennell, vice captain of Worcester Warriors rugby team. His youngest son, Jonathan, has also represented Gloucestershire Second XI as a Left Arm Orthodox Spin Bowler.\n\nDilley made his first-class debut for Kent at the age of eighteen in 1977, against Cambridge University. He failed to take a wicket, and was not selected again until the following season. He played his second match in June 1978 against the touring Pakistan team, but again failed to take a wicket. It was only in his third first-class match, against Middlesex, that he made his presence felt, taking seven wickets in the match to help his team to a six-wicket win.\n\nDilley played two more first-class matches that season, but took only one wicket. Perhaps more significant was his selection for England Young Cricketers against their West Indian counterparts for two of the three \"Tests\" and the single one-day game. Real progress in county cricket, however, would have to wait for 1979, when Dilley played 31 senior games for Kent, including a useful effort of 4–41 in the World Cup warm-up match against the New Zealanders. He finished with 49 first-class wickets at an average of 23.48 that season, and already his express pace was attracting attention.\n\nThe England selectors, looking for a young fast bowler for that winter's tour of Australia, took the bold decision to include the 20-year-old Dilley in the squad. He made his international debut in a One Day International on 24 November 1979 against West Indies at Sydney during the 1979/80 Benson & Hedges World Series Cup, a triangular tournament that also featured Australia. England won the match by two runs. Dilley was given the new ball, and struck in his third over when he claimed the wicket of Desmond Haynes. Rain enforced a revised target; the West Indies needed to score 198 runs in 47 overs, but fell short and lost the match. Dilley finished with 6–2–21–1, with an economy rate of 3.50 runs per over.\n\nA fortnight later, Dilley appeared in his first Test match, making him the youngest cricketer to play for England in thirty years when he entered the field during the Perth Test at the WACA on 14 December 1979. England captain Mike Brearley showed confidence in Dilley and gave him the new ball at the start of the Australian first innings. Dilley did well during his initial bowling spell, but had to wait until Australia lost their fifth wicket on 127 runs to claim his first Test wicket. The batsman was Peter Toohey, caught by Derek Underwood for 19. Dilley then claimed his second wicket when Rod Marsh was caught behind by Bob Taylor. Marsh had scored 42 runs and Australia were 219 for 7 at that point. Australia finished 244 all out, and Dilley took figures of 18–1–47–2 with an economy rate of 2.61. However, his debut bowling performance was overshadowed by Botham taking 6 for 78.\n\nEngland were all out for 228, giving a lead of 16 runs to Australia. Dilley scored an unbeaten 38, and stayed at the wicket for 206 minutes, facing 57 balls. His score was the second-highest in the innings, after Brearley. Dilley again took the new ball in Australia's second innings, but did not get a wicket until Dennis Lillee gave a catch to Peter Willey at gully. Lillee scored 19 runs and England needed 354 runs for victory. Geoff Boycott showed resistance with an unbeaten 99, and Dilley made a partnership of nineteen runs with Boycott for eighth wicket. England finished 215 all out, and Australia won the Test by 138 runs.\n\nHe acquitted himself reasonably well, taking three wickets and scoring a handy unbeaten 38 in the first innings. The game featured a memorable item on the second-innings scorecard:\n\nEngland lost the match by 138 runs, and although Dilley also played in the second Test, which was also lost, he was replaced by John Lever for the third and final game. Dilley took only seven wickets on that tour – \"£7,000 for seven wickets\" as the tour manager Alec Bedser commented. The Australians triumphed in this match as well, to win the rubber 3–0, although the Ashes were not at stake, and were retained by England on the basis of their 5–1 victory in the six-game series that had been played a year earlier.\n\nIn 1980, Dilley was not selected until the third Test against West Indies, at Old Trafford. Rain intervened, as it was to do in the fourth and fifth Tests as well, and all were drawn. Dilley's eleven wickets, in the three innings he was able to make use of, made sure of his place to face the same opponents in the Caribbean that winter. England were outplayed in the overseas Tests and lost the four-match series 2–0 (the Guyana Test having been cancelled over the Robin Jackman affair) and both ODIs, but Dilley's ten wickets were enough for him to retain his place for the 1981 Ashes series.\n\nDilley began the 1981 Ashes series strongly, taking 12 wickets in the first two Tests, and was thus retained for the third Test at Headingley. This game is best remembered for England's sensational victory after following on, and for the heroics of Ian Botham and Bob Willis, but Dilley played his part as well, albeit in the unfamiliar role of batsman. Coming to the crease in the second innings with England at 135–7, 92 runs in arrears, Dilley had no orders from his captain, Mike Brearley, when he joined Botham at the crease. Botham said, \"Right then, let's have a bit of fun\", and the two men put on 117 in just 80 minutes before Dilley (56, from 75 balls) was bowled by Terry Alderman. England eventually established a lead of 130, and Dilley then held a boundary catch to dismiss Rod Marsh in Australia's second innings. Exceptional bowling by Bob Willis (8–43) resulted in Australia being dismissed for 111, and gave England an unexpected victory by 18 runs.\n\nDespite his part in the win at Headingley, Dilley did not play in the fourth Test, nor in the two that followed, being replaced variously by John Emburey, Paul Allott and Mike Hendrick. He did get picked for the subsequent 1981/2 India tour, having pulled out of Graham Gooch's rebel tour of South Africa, something he regretted for financial reasons.\n\nDespite being in and out of the side for the next couple of years, Dilley's future as a Test player seemed reasonably bright by 1983, and he played a full part in England's World Cup campaign. Following the tournament, a neck injury forced him out of the game for a year, and although he returned to county cricket in 1985, there was some doubt as to his long-term prospects. A decent performance that winter for Natal helped in his rehabilitation and, by 1986, Dilley took 63 first-class wickets and earned a recall to the England side.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1988, Dilley took 83 Test wickets at an average of 26.43, and was generally regarded as England's foremost strike bowler. He developed significant pace and outswing from a long, wide run up, approaching the wicket at an angle almost 45 degrees. Perhaps his most significant success came in 1986/87 when he took 5–68 in the first innings of the first Test at Brisbane to help his team to a victory that set them on their way to an Ashes win, and he also took 20 wickets at 15.85 in ODIs. In the drawn series against New Zealand the following winter he produced his career-best bowling figures, ripping through the Kiwi line-up with 6–38 (including the first five wickets to fall) at Lancaster Park, Christchurch. He was fined £250 in the same match for swearing at the umpire, comments which were clearly picked up by the stump microphone. He took a further 5–60 in Auckland, and finished the series with fifteen wickets at an average of 14.\n\nHis bowling style often fascinated many, with his unusual run-up a topic of discussion. It is believed that he tried to adopt Jeff Thomson's slingy bowling style, and later Dilley's style was used by Chris Cairns in New Zealand.\n\nIn 1988, when talking about the effects of coaching fast bowlers, Geoffrey Boycott commented, \"Remember what happened to Graham Dilley, who started out as a genuinely quick bowler. They started stuffing line and length in his ear and now he has Dennis Lillee's action with Denis Thatcher's pace\".\n\nFor the 1987 season, Dilley moved to Worcestershire, and his new county were about to begin the most successful period in their history, winning four trophies in the next three years. Despite further injury problems, he proved a vital cog in the wheel as Worcestershire won the 1988 and 1989 County Championships; it was during this period that he wrote, with team-mate Graeme Hick, an account of one of the title-winning seasons, entitled \"Hick'n'Dilley Circus\".\n\nDilley's Test career was beginning to wind down by this time, and his final match was at Edgbaston in the 1989 Ashes series. He made certain that he would not be picked again by accompanying Mike Gatting on the rebel tour to South Africa that winter, although he continued to play for his county for a couple more years. Dilley appeared in three of Worcestershire's matches in April 1992, but despite a couple of appearances in the Second XI, he announced his retirement at the end of that season because of recurring injury problems.\n\nDilley's move to Worcestershire denied him the financial security of a benefit season. He found employment after retirement as a coach, firstly for the England women's cricket team, and then accompanying the men's side on the tour to India in 2001/02. He also worked in a coaching capacity for Zimbabwe and Scotland. His last position was as head coach for Loughborough UCCE, where he was director of cricket for 11 years and coached, among others, Monty Panesar, James Anyon, Ruel Brathwaite, James Adams and Rob Taylor.\n\nDilley was the father of the Worcester Warriors rugby union captain, Chris Pennell.\n\nDilley died in a hospice in Leicester on 5 October 2011, aged 52, just one week after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. A memorial service was held in Worcester Cathedral on Wednesday 9 November 2011.\n\n"}

{"id": "2004052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2004052", "title": "Richmond Barthé", "text": "Richmond Barthé\n\nJames Richmond Barthé, also known as Richmond Barthé (January 28, 1901 – March 5, 1989) was an African-American sculptor associated with the Harlem Renaissance. Barthé is best known for his portrayal of black subjects. The focus of his artistic work was portraying the diversity and spirituality of man. Barthé once said: \"All my life I have been interested in trying to capture the spiritual quality I see and feel in people, and I feel that the human figure as God made it, is the best means of expressing this spirit in man.\"\n\nJames Richmond Barthé was born in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. His father's name is Richmond Barthé and mother's name is Marie Clementine Robateau. Barthé's father died at age 22, when he was only a few months old, leaving his mother to raise him alone. She worked as a dressmaker and before Barthé began elementary school she remarried to William Franklin, with whom she eventually had five additional children.\n\nBarthé showed a passion and skill for drawing from an early age. His mother was, in many ways, instrumental in his decision to pursue art as a vocation. Barthé once said: \"When I was crawling on the floor, my mother gave me paper and pencil to play with. It kept me quiet while she did her errands. At six years old I started painting. A lady my mother sewed for gave me a set of watercolors. By that time, I could draw very well.\"\n\nBarthé continued making drawings throughout his childhood and adolescence, under the encouragement of his teachers. His fourth grade teacher, Inez Labat, from the Bay St. Louis Public School, influenced his aesthetic development by encouraging his artistic growth. When he was only twelve years old, Barthé exhibited his work at the Bay St. Louis Country Fair.\n\nHowever, young Barthé was beset with health problems, and after an attack of typhoid fever at age fourteen, he withdrew from school. Following this, he worked as a houseboy and handyman, but still spent his free time drawing. A wealthy family, the Ponds, who spent summers at Bay St. Louis, invited Barthé to work for them as a houseboy in New Orleans, Louisiana. Through his employment with the Ponds, Barthé broadened his cultural horizons and knowledge of art, and was introduced to Lyle Saxon, a local writer for the \"Times Picayune\". Saxon was fighting against the racist system of school segregation, and tried unsuccessfully to get Barthé registered in an art school in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1924 Barthé donated his first oil painting to a local Catholic church to be auctioned at a fundraiser. Impressed by his talent, Reverend Harry F. Kane encouraged Barthé to pursue his artistic career and raised money for him to undertake studies in fine art. At age twenty-three, with less than a high school education and no formal training in art, Barthé applied to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the Art Institute of Chicago, and was accepted by the latter.\n\nDuring the next four years Barthé followed a curriculum structured for majors in painting. During this time he boarded with his aunt Rose and made a living working different jobs. His work caught the attention of Dr. Charles Maceo Thompson, a patron of the arts and supporter of many talented young black artists. Barthé was a flattering portrait painter, and Dr. Thompson helped him to secure many lucrative commissions from the city's affluent black citizens.\n\nAt the Art Institute of Chicago, Barthé's formal artistic instruction in sculpture took place in anatomy class with professor of anatomy and German artist Charles Schroeder. Students practiced modeling in clay to gain a better understanding of the three-dimensional form. This experience proved to be, according to Barthé, a turning point in his career, shifting his attention away from painting and towards sculpture.\n\nBarthé had his debut as a professional sculptor at \"The Negro in Art Week\" exhibition in 1927, while still a student of painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. He also exhibited in the April 1928 annual exhibition of the Chicago Art League. The critical acclaim allowed Barthé to enjoy numerous important commissions such as the Bust of Henry O. Tanner (1928) and Toussaint L’Ouverture (1928). Though he was still in his late twenties, within a short time he won recognition, primarily through his sculptures, for making significant contributions to modern African American art. By 1929, the essentials of his artistic education complete, Barthé decided to leave Chicago and head for New York City.\n\nWhile many young artists found it very difficult to earn a living from their art during the Great Depression, the 1930s were Richmond Barthé's most prolific years. The shift from the Art Institute of Chicago to New York City, where he moved following graduation, exposed Barthé to new experiences as he arrived in the city during the peak of the Harlem Renaissance. He established his studio in Harlem in 1930 after winning the Julius Rosenwald Fund fellowship at his first solo exhibition at the Women's City Club in Chicago. However, in 1931, he moved his studio in Harlem to Greenwich Village. Barthé once said: \"I live downtown because it is much more convenient for my contacts from whom it is possible for me to make a living.\" He understood the importance of public relations and keeping abreast of collectors' interests.\n\nBarthé mingled with the bohemian circles of downtown Manhattan. Initially unable to afford live models, he sought and found inspiration from on-stage performers. Living downtown provided him the opportunity to socialize not only among collectors but also among artists, dance performers, and actors. His remarkable visual memory permitted him to work without models, producing numerous representations of the human body in movement. During this time, he completed works such as Black Narcissus (1929), The Blackberry Woman (1930), Drum Major (1928), The Breakaway (1929), busts of Alain Locke (1928), bust of A’leila Walker (1928), The Deviled Crab-Man (1929), Rose McClendon (1932), Féral Benga (1935), and Sir John Gielgud as Hamlet (1935).\n\nIn October 1933, a major body of Barthé's work inaugurated the Caz Delbo Galleries at the Rockefeller Center in New York. That same year his works were also exhibited at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933. In the summer of 1934, Barthé went on a tour to Paris with Reverend Edward F. Murphy, a friend of Reverend Kane from New Orleans, who exchanged his first class ticket for two third class tickets to share with Barthé. This trip exposed Barthé to classical art, but also to performers such as Féral Benga and African American entertainer Josephine Baker, of whom he made portraits in 1935 and 1951, respectively. During the next two decades, he built his reputation as a sculptor. He was awarded several awards and has experienced success after success and was considered by writers and critics as one of the leading \"moderns\" of his time. Among his African-American friends were Wallace Thurman, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, Jimmie Daniels, Countee Cullen, and Harold Jackman. Ralph Ellison was his first student. His white supporters included Carl Van Vechten, Noel Sullivan, Charles Cullen, Lincoln Kirstein, Paul Cadmus, Edgar Kaufmann Jr., and Jared French.\n\nIn 1945 Barthé became a member of the National Sculpture Society.\n\nEventually, the tense environment and violence of the city began to take its toll, and he decided to abandon his life of fame and move to Jamaica in the West Indies in 1947. His career flourished in Jamaica and he remained there until the mid-1960s when ever-growing violence forced him to yet again move. For the next five years he lived in Switzerland, Spain, and Italy before eventually settling in Pasadena, California in a rental apartment. In that apartment, Barthé worked on his memoirs and most importantly, editioned many of his works with the financial assistance of the actor James Garner until his death in 1989. Garner copyrighted Barthé's artwork, hired a biographer to organize and document his work, and established the Richmond Barthe Trust.\n\nBarthé's first public commission came from the New York City's Federal Art Project and for the 80-foot bas-relief in cast stone, (1939), for the embellishment of the Harlem River Houses complex, but upon completion, his work was installed at the Kingsborough Houses in Brooklyn. His other most notable public works include a monumental bronze of Toussaint L’Ouverture, (1950), in front of the National Palace in Port-au-Prince, Haiti; 40-foot bronze equestrian statue Jean Jacques Dessalines, (1952), at Champs-du-Mars, Port-au-Prince, Haiti; a cast stone relief of American Eagle, (1940), on the façade of Social Security Board Building in Washington, DC; a marble Arthur Brisbane Memorial in New York City, (1939), a later enlarged version of a sculpture of Rose McClendon (1932), for Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, (c.1935); and the design of several Haitian coins, still in use today.\n\nBarthe's Haitian works came in a time after his 1950 move to Ocho Rios, Jamaica, and were among his largest and most famous works. The huge 40-foot equestrian bronze of Jean Jacques Dessalines, (1952), was one of four heroic sculptures commissioned in 1948 by Haitian political leaders to mark independence celebrations. The Dessalines monument was part of a larger 1954 restoration of the \"Champs-du-Mars\" park in Port-au-Prince, Barthe's 40-foot-high Toussaint L’Ouverture statue (1950), and stone monument was positioned nearer the National Palace, and was unveiled in 1950 with two other commissioned heroic sculptures (in the capital and in the north of the county) by Cuban sculptor Blanco Ramos. At the time, one African-American newspaper called the collection \"the Greatest Negro Monuments on earth.\" L'Overture was in fact a subject Barthe returned to several times, having created a bust (1926) and painted portrait (1929) of the figure early in his career.\n\nBarthé's first debut as a professional sculptor was at \"The Negro in Art Week\" exhibition in Chicago in 1927. His first solo exhibition was held at the Women's City Club in Chicago in 1930, exhibiting a selection of thirty-eight works of sculpture, painting, and works on paper. In 1932, the Whitney Museum of American Art decided to purchase a bronze copy of the Blackberry Woman (1930) after exhibiting it at the opening exhibition of \"Contemporary American Artists\" in 1932. Barthé's work was paired with drawings by Delacroix, Matisse, Laurencin, Daumier, and Forain at the Caz-Delbo Gallery in 1933 in New York City. In 1942, he had an exhibition of 20 works of art at the South Side Community Art Center in Chicago. The retrospective which included works from private collections shown for the first time, Richmond Barthé: The Seeker was the inaugural exhibition of the African American Galleries at the Ohr-O'Keefe Museum of Art in Biloxi, Mississippi which was curated by Margaret Rose Vendryes, PhD. \nBarthé's most recent retrospective, \"Richmond Barthé: His Life in Art\", consisted of over 30 sculptures and photographs. The exhibition was organized by Landau Traveling Exhibitions of Los Angeles, CA, in 2009. The exhibition venues included the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, the California African American Museum, the Dixon Gallery and Gardens, and the NCCU Art Museum.\n\nThe Whitney Museum of American Art purchased Barthé's bronze copy of the Blackberry Woman (1930) in 1932, after the inaugural exhibition \"Whitney Annual\" in 1932. The African Dancer (1933) was also purchased after being displayed in \"Whitney Annual\" in 1933, as well as the Comedian in 1935. The Metropolitan Museum of Art purchased The Boxer (1942) after \"Artists For Victory\" exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1942. Barthé's other pieces are in the collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum; the Art Institute of Chicago, Fallingwater, and others.\n\nRichmond Barthé received many honors during his career, including the Rosenwald Fellowship in 1930 and the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1940. Barthé was also the first African American artist to be represented, together with the painter Jacob Lawrence, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's permanent collection. In 1945, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He also received awards for interracial justice and honorary degrees from Xavier and St. Francis Universities. He was the recipient of the Audubon Artists Gold Medal in 1950. A few years after his arrival in Pasadena, California, the city renamed the street where Barthé lived in \"Barthé Drive\". He also was honored and received an award from President Carter in 1980.\n\nOnce, when interviewed, Barthé indicated that he was homosexual. Throughout his life, he had occasional romantic relationships that were short lived. In an undated letter to Alain Locke he indicated that he desired a long-term relationship with a \"Negro friend and a lover\". The book Barthé: A Life in Sculpture, by Margaret Rose Vandryes, links Barthé to writer Lyle Saxon, to African American art critic Alain Locke, young sculptor John Rhoden, and the photographer Carl Van Vechten. According to a letter from Alain Locke to Richard Bruce Nugent, Barthé had a romantic relationship with Nugent, a cast member from the production of Porgy & Bess.\n\nBarthé was a devoted Roman Catholic. Many of Barthé's later work depicted religious subjects, including \"John the Baptist\" (1942), \"Come Unto Me\" (1945), \"Head of Jesus\" (1949), \"Angry Christ\" (1946), and \"Resurrection\" (1969). Works like \"The Mother\" (1935), \"Mary\" (1945), or his unfinished \"Crucifixion\" (ca. 1944) are noticeably influenced by the interracial justice for what he was awarded the James J. Hoey Award by the Catholic Interracial Council in 1945.\n\n\n"}

It is an IAAF Gold Label Road Race.\n\nThe first competitive marathon in Singapore was held on 5 December 1982, with an estimated participation size of 15,000 runners. Only the 2,300 competitive runners would have to register while the non-competitive runners could freely as joggers along the route. It has grown significantly since its inaugural race in 1982 – the 2013 event attracted a total of 60,000 entrants for all categories.\n\nIn 2017, Singapore was announced as a candidate city for the Abbott World Marathon Majors, a series of the six largest and most renowned marathons in the world. In 2019, the full- and half-marathons were held in the evening in order to fulfill criteria to be listed in the Abbott World Marathon Majors, instead of the usual flag off timing at dawn. This led to a series of road closures which resulted in 3-hour long traffic jams around the city center on the race day itself as there were other major activities happening at the same time in the vicinity of the race.\n\nThere are four separate categories of competition: the full marathon, the half marathon, the 10 kilometres run, and the 10 km wheelchair race. Furthermore, 10 km team competitions as well as a number of short running competitions for children.\n\nPrize money for the full marathon race is divided into three categories: the open prize (for all competitors), the Singapore prize (open to national competitors), and the veteran prize (which acts as a masters competition).\n\nBetween 2004 and 2008, it was part of \"The Greatest Race on Earth\" series of road races, sponsored by Standard Chartered Singapore (the other three legs being the Hong Kong Marathon, Mumbai Marathon and Nairobi Marathon).\n\nThe times recorded at the Singapore Marathon tend to be slower than those at other marathons as Singapore's climate is usually hot and humid. Kenyans Luke Kibet and Salina Kosgei are the men's and women's course record holders, respectively. The 2006 edition also acted as the country's national championships, with Elangovan Ganesan and Vivian Tan Yoke Pin taking the honours.\n\nKey: \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2004060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2004060", "title": "Horagalles", "text": "Horagalles\n\nIn Sami shamanism, Horagalles, also written Hora Galles and Thora Galles and often equated with Tiermes or \"Aijeke\" (i.e. \"grandfather or great grandfather\"), is the thunder god. He is depicted as a wooden figure with a nail in the head and with a hammer, or occasionally on shaman drums, two hammers. It has been suggested that name is derived from that of the Norse god Thor.\n\nIdols of Horagalles are made of wood and have a nail or spike and a piece of flint in the head. He has a hammer called Wetschera, Aijeke Wetschera, or Ajeke veċċera, \"grandfather's hammer.\"\n\nHoragalles is the god of the sky, thunder and lightning, the rainbow, weather, oceans, and lakes and rules over human life, health and wellbeing. He punishes \"hurtful demons\" or \"evil spirits\" (i.e., trolls) who frequent the rocks and mountains; he destroys them with his lightning, shoots them with his bow, or dashes their brains out with his hammer. The rainbow is his bow, \"Aijeke dauge\".\n\nOn Sami shaman drums Horagalles was occasionally depicted with a sledgehammer in one hand and a cross-hammer in the other, or symbolized by two crossed hammers. He made thunder and lightning with one hammer and withdrew them with the other to prevent damage.\n\nThe name \"Horagalles\" does not occur in older dictionaries of Sami languages, for instance in the mid-19th century. He is often equated with Tiermes; in 1673 Johannes Scheffer, who did not use the name Horagalles, wrote that when Aijeke thundered, he was called Tiermes. There is considerable regional variation in the names; Horagalles (with its various spellings, including Thoragalles) is characteristically southern Sami, and the rainbow is referred to by a variety of names referring to thunder.\n\nEarly scholars noted the similarities between Horagalles and the Norse thunder-god Thor and that some Sami called him Thoron or simply Thor, and were unsure which had influenced which. But the name Horagalles is now interpreted as a loanword from the Old Norse \"Þórr Karl\", \"the Old Man Thor,\" \"Thor, the Elder,\" or \"Thor fellow,\" \"Thor Karl\" (possibly from Norwegian \"Torrekall\"), or Swedish \"Torsmannen\", \"the thunder man.\" \n\nHoragalles' consort is called Ravdna, and the red berries of the rowan tree are sacred to her. The name \"Ravdna\" resembles North Germanic names for the tree, such as Old Norse \"reynir\", and according to the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Skáldskaparmál\", the rowan is called \"the salvation of Thor\" because Thor once saved himself by clinging to it. It has therefore been theorized that the Norse goddess Sif, Thor's wife, was once conceived of in the form of a rowan to which Thor clung.\n\nTiermes is a Sami god of thunder and rain, also called Aijeke or Ajeke and often identified with Horagalles.\n\nTiermes is god of the sky and thunder and lightning, the rainbow, weather, oceans, and lakes and rules over human life, health, and well-being. He protects people and their animals from \"hurtful demons\" and \"evil spirits\" (i.e., trolls). According to the mid-18th century \"Cérémonies et coutumes religieuses de tous les peuples du monde\", \"Thiermes or Thoron\" is the first in a trinity, of whom the other members are Storjunkare and Baivre or Jumala. He is also called Aijeke, \"grandfather\" or \"great-grandfather\"; in 1673 Johannes Scheffer wrote that when Aijeke thundered, he was called Tiermes.\n\nThe names of the god vary considerably between regions, with Tiermes and variants being commonly used among northern Sami and Horagalles and variants among southern Sami, but unlike Horagalles, the name Tiermes is not a loanword; it is related to \"Torym\", found in Siberia.\n\n"}

From January 2012 this was transferred to the John Holland Group operating as the Country regional Network.\n\nIn July 2011, responsibility for the Werris Creek to North Star line was transferred from the Country Rail Infrastructure Authority to the ARTC.\n\nIn August 2012, the Government of New South Wales owned RailCorp leased its Metropolitan Goods line from Port Botany to Sefton to the ARTC for 50 years.\n\nIn January 2010, the Government of Queensland leased its standard gauge line from Border Loop on the New South Wales border to Acacia Ridge, Brisbane to the ARTC for 60 years.\n\nIn February 2014, the Federal and Queensland governments agreed to investigate further incorporating Queensland into the national rail network. This ultimately did not proceed.\n\nThe ARTC does not operate any trains, but provides and maintains the infrastructure for train operators to run on. The tracks controlled by the ARTC are located in all states except Australian Capital Territory & Tasmania, and were previously run by six separate state railways in an uncoordinated fashion that gave an advantage to road transport. By combining the infrastructure under one corporation it was expected that a more integrated and coordinated one-stop-shop would be created. It provides its own reporting numbers to trains that operate on its network.\n\nThe ARTC does not control any of the narrow gauge track in Queensland or South Australia, nor broad gauge track in Victoria. However it does control the Albion to Jacana freight line which has been partially converted to dual gauge for use as a passing lane, but is considered a main line on the broad gauge network.\n\n\n"}

It is the diester formed from terephthalic acid and methanol. It is a white solid that melts to give a distillable colourless liquid.\n\nDimethyl terephthalate (DMT) has been produced in a number of ways. Conventionally, and still of commercial value, is the direct esterification of terephthalic acid. Alternatively, it can be prepared by alternating oxidation and methyl-esterification steps from p-xylene via methyl \"p\"-toluate (PT).\n\nThe common method for the production of DMT from \"p\"-xylene (PX) and methanol consists of a multistep process involving both oxidation and esterification. A mixture of p-xylene (PX) and methyl \"p\"-toluate is oxidized with air in the presence of a cobalt and manganese catalysts.\nThe acid mixture resulting from the oxidation is esterified with methanol to produce a mixture of esters. The crude ester mixture is distilled to remove all the heavy boilers and residue produced; the lighter esters are recycled to the oxidation section. The raw DMT is then sent to the crystallization section to remove DMT isomers, residual acids and aromatic aldehydes.\n\nOxidation of methyl p-toluate followed by esterification also yields dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) as shown in the below reaction:\n\nDimethyl terephthalate (DMT) production through direct esterification\n\nIf highly impure terephthalic acid is available, DMT can be made in a separate process by esterification with methanol to dimethyl terephthalate, which is then purified by distillation:\nat presence of o-xylene at 250–300 °C.\n\nDMT is used in the production of polyesters, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT), and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). It consists of benzene substituted with carboxymethyl groups (COCH) at the 1 and 4 positions. Because DMT is volatile, it is an intermediate in some schemes for the recycling of PET, e.g. from plastic bottles.\n\nHydrogenation of DMT affords the diol cyclohexanedimethanol, which is a useful monomer.\n\n"}

In 1999, Claire Morris-Dobbie launched \"SLAM: A New Way to Tell the Truth\", a pre-made \"slam book\" with online tie-in features in an attempt to combine nostalgia with the growing World Wide Web. It was billed as a \"kinder and gentler\" slam book for teens and pre-teens with the goal of encouraging them to think and communicate, write and express themselves. \n\nSlam books can also exist in virtual formats.

A book on Jackson’s career, \"Handsome Ransom Jackson: Accidental Big Leaguer\", was published in 2016. He died at his home on March 20, 2019.\n\nAfter a year at the University of Arkansas, he transferred twice, and helped lead the football teams of Texas Christian University (1945) and the University of Texas at Austin (1946) to consecutive Cotton Bowl Classic appearances as a halfback. Playing baseball in college he hit .500, .438 and .400.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs signed him in 1947. On 2 May 1950, the 24-year-old made his major-league debut. \"\"Handsome Ransom\"\" had four solid seasons at third base for the Cubs from 1951 to 1955.\n\nJackson followed up a slow rookie season (in which he had 111 at-bats over 34 games) with a solid second season, in which he hit .276 with 76 RBI and 16 home runs. He struggled again in his third major-league season, his average falling to .232, with 34 RBI and 9 home runs.\n\nJackson rebounded over the next three seasons, posting batting averages of .285 (1953), .273 (1954), and .265 (1955). His RBI (66, 67, and 70) and home run (19, 19, and 21) totals also rebounded. Nor did his defensive play lag behind: in 1955, Jackson led the National League (NL) in double plays.\n\nHis hitting and excellent play at third earned him consecutive trips to the All-Star Game in his last two seasons in Chicago. In the 1954 game he came off the bench behind starter Ray Jablonski of the St. Louis Cardinals, in an 11–9 loss to the American League (AL). The next season, 1955, he again came off the bench, in a 6–5 win for the National League, behind the Milwaukee Braves' Eddie Mathews.\n\nOn the strength of Jackson's five continuous seasons in Chicago, the Dodgers, looking for a replacement for their aging All-Star third baseman Jackie Robinson, traded Don Hoak, Russ Meyer and Walt Moryn to the Cubs for Jackson and Don Elston.\n\nJackson played off the bench behind Robinson in 1956. Despite having over 200 fewer plate appearances than in his previous year, he managed a .274 average with 8 home runs and 53 RBI. The Dodgers played in the famed \"subway Series\" against their hated cross-town rivals, the New York Yankees in the 1956 World Series, but Jackson had only three pinch-hit at-bats, going 0-for-3, with two strike-outs.\n\nThe following season (1957), Jackson suffered a major knee injury, ending his chances to become a star for the Dodgers. He played off the bench, not appearing in more than 64 games in a season for the rest of his career. He totaled only eight more home runs and 43 RBIs combined for the next three seasons.\n\n\n\n"}

Roderick Grierson (vice-president), Milbry Polk, and several other individuals for the purpose of furthering understanding among cultures by organizing and exchanging international art exhibitions. Over the course of the next 15 years, InterCultura organized and brought to the U.S. over a dozen important exhibitions from countries as diverse as Ethiopia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, and many other nations. Exhibitions of American art were sent abroad by InterCultura in exchange.\n\nInterCultura's practice was to bring together the leading scholars with great objects of art to produce exhibitions of outstanding scholarship. InterCultura's activities involved multi-project exchange programs supported by U.S. embassies in foreign countries to send U.S. art abroad in exchange for exhibitions from foreign national collections coming to the U.S.\n\nThe first major exhibition initiated by InterCultura was \"The Blood of Kings: A New Interpretation of Maya Art,\" which opened at the Kimbell Art Museum in 1986. The Blood of Kings exemplified the InterCultura approach in that it was a presentation of ground-breaking scholarship, curated by two of the leaders of the group of scholars that had recently deciphered the Maya script: Linda Schele, of the University of Texas, and Mary Miller, of Yale University. The exhibition demonstrated, through a never-before-assembled collection of ancient Maya art borrowed from sources as diverse as the British Museum and the Government of Honduras, the imperative of an entirely new approach based on the decipherment of the Maya writing system. It revealed the Maya as real individuals - kings, queens, and royal dynasties as blood-thirsty and colorful as their Old World counterparts. The power of the exhibition was critical in the collapse of the old view of the Maya as peaceable mathematicians, and the emergence of the currently accepted picture of the Maya. The catalog remains a landmark addition to Maya scholarship and is widely cited.\n\nStarting in 1987, at the dawn of the glasnost era, InterCultura organized an exhibition titled \"10 + 10: Contemporary Soviet and American Painters,\" the first exhibition of dissident or \"non-official\" art from the then-Soviet Union to be seen in US and Soviet museums. Following on this, in 1988 InterCultura negotiated the most extensive cultural exchange program ever signed between the then-Soviet Ministry of Culture and a private U.S. institution. Included was the most extensive exhibition presented in the US of the 19th century Russian group of painters called the Wanderers, titled \"The Wanderers: Masters of 19th Century Russian Painting.\" The InterCultura US-Soviet exhibition exchange program survived the change from the Soviet Union to post-Soviet Russia, and the exchange concluded in 1993 with the most important exhibition of Medieval Russian art ever shown in the United States, a show of treasures from the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg titled \"The Gates of Mystery,\" , which was also seen in the UK at the Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\nOther exhibitions organized by InterCultura included \"The Art of Private Devotion: Mexican Retablo Painting,\" the first major exhibition of Ethiopian art borrowed from Ethiopian sources ever held in the U.S., titled \"African Zion: Sacred Art of Ethiopia,\" the first major exhibition of the art of American painter Robert Motherwell shown in Mexico, titled \"Robert Motherwell: An Open Door,\", a major exhibition of Georgia O'Keeffe shown in Mexico and Japan, titled \"Georgia O'Keeffe: American and Modern,\", an exhibition of contemporary Japanese art, titled \"Seven Artists: Aspects of Contemporary Japanese Art,\" and numerous additional shows on subjects ranging from modern Italian master drawings to Mexican dance masks.\n\nMuseums at which InterCultura Exhibitions were shown include: Albright-Knox Art Gallery (Buffalo), Art Institute of Chicago, California Afro-American Museum (Los Angeles), Central Exhibition Hall (St. Petersburg, Russia), Cincinnati Art Museum, Corcoran Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.), Dallas Museum of Art, Davenport Museum of Art, DuSable Museum of African American History (Chicago), Field Museum of Natural History, Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, Hayward Gallery (London), Henry Art Gallery (University of Washington), Kimbell Art Museum, Milwaukee Art Museum, Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Museum of African-American Life & Culture (Dallas), Palacio de Bellas Artes (Mexico City), Rufino Tamayo Museum (Mexico City), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Sarah Blaffer Gallery (Houston), Serpentine Gallery (London), State Picture Gallery of Georgia (Tbilisi), The Art Museum, Princeton University, The Schomburg Center for Research in Black African Culture (New York), The Walters Art Museum, Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), Victoria and Albert Museum (London), Yokohama Art Museum (Japan), and others.\n\nFollowing the departure of its president Gordon Dee Smith and vice president Roderick Grierson, after a decade and a half of creating and touring exhibitions, InterCultura was dissolved in 1996.\n\n"}

It is the oldest preserved extant hymn to the Blessed Virgin Mary as \"Theotokos\". The hymn is well known in many Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox countries, and is often a favourite song used along with \"Salve Regina\".\n\nThe earliest text of this hymn was found in a Coptic Orthodox Christmas liturgy. The papyrus records the hymn in Greek, dated to the 3rd century by papyrologist E. Lobel and by scholar C.H. Roberts to the 4th century. According to scholar Serafim Seppälä \"\"there are no determinate theological or philological reasons to reject the 3rd century dating.\"\"\n\nThe hymn is used in the Coptic liturgy to this day, as well as in the Armenian, Byzantine, Ambrosian, and Roman Rite liturgies. It was part of Sulpician custom that all classes ended with a recitation of this prayer. Besides the Greek text, ancient versions can be found in Coptic, Syriac, Armenian and Latin.\n\nHenri de Villiers finds in the term \"blessed\" a reference to the salutation by Elizabeth in Luke .\n\"Praesidium\" is translated as \"an assistance given in time of war by fresh troops in a strong manner.\"\n\nThe former medieval and post-medieval practice in several dioceses, especially in France, was to use the Sub tuum as the final antiphon at Compline instead of the \"Salve Regina\" and in the Rite of Braga where it is sung at the end of Mass.\n\nIn the Byzantine Rite used by the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, the hymn occurs as the last dismissal hymn of daily Vespers in Great Lent. In Greek practice it is usually sung in Neo-Byzantine chant.\n\nIn the Armenian Rite, the hymn is sung on the Eve of Theophany and is also used as an acclamation (մաղթանք) in the daily compline service known as the Rest Hour (Հանգստեան Ժամ). A slightly different version of the hymn is appended to the Trisagion when the latter is chanted in the daily Morning (Առաւօտեան) and Evening (Երեկոյեան) Hours of the Daily Office.\n\nThe Slavonic version of the hymn is also often used outside of Great Lent, with the triple invocation «Пресвѧтаѧ Богородице спаси насъ» (\"Most Holy Theotokos, save us\") appended. Other than the traditional and modern chant settings, which are the most commonly used, the most well-known musical setting is perhaps that of Dmytro Bortniansky.\n\nIn the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church it is used as the antiphon for the Nunc Dimittis at Compline in the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and in the Liturgy of the Hours may be used as the Marian antiphon after Compline outside of Eastertide.\n\nThe Latin version has also been set to music in the West many times, notably by Marc-Antoine Charpentier, H 20, H 28, H 352, Antionio Salieri, Ludwig van Beethoven and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nThe prayer has a special significance for Marists, and it is often heard in Marist schools and groups around the world. It is also commonly used by the Salesians in honor of Mary Help of Christians.\n\nPope Francis asked to pray this Hymn along with the Rosary and the Prayer to Saint Michael asking for the unity of the Church during October (2018) in the face of diverse scandals and accusations. In the official comuniqué he added that \"Russian mystics and the great saints of all the traditions advised, in moments of spiritual turbulence, to shelter beneath the mantle of the Holy Mother of God pronouncing the invocation 'Sub Tuum Praesidium'”.\n\nThe earliest Church Slavonic manuscripts have the prayer in the following form:\nThis version continues to be used by the Old Believers today. In the 17th century, under the liturgical reforms of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow, the Russian Orthodox Church adopted a new translation (but parishes continue to use the form given above):\nThis second version continues in use today.\n\nThe Latin translation, likely derived from the Greek, dates from the 11th century: \nSome of the Latin versions have also incorporated the following verses often attributed to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux to the above translation:\n\n\"Domina nostra, Mediatrix nostra, Advocata nostra\" (Our Lady, our Mediatrix, Our Advocate)\n\n\"tuo Filio nos reconcilia\" (Reconcile us to your Son)\n\n\"tuo Filio nos recommenda\" (Recommend us to your Son)\n\n\"tuo Filio nos representa\" (Represent us to your Son)\n\n"}

His popularity had steadily decreased through the 1970s and early 1980s and mainstream record companies were not convinced that Donovan's albums could generate enough record sales to warrant release. Donovan decided that to win over the record companies and reach his American and British fans, he would record new versions of both \"Sunshine Superman\" and \"Season of the Witch\" for inclusion on his next album. Both songs were released on the \"Sunshine Superman\" album in 1966 and \"Donovan's Greatest Hits\" in 1969. The name recognition of these two songs would give the record companies marketing leverage and guarantee release.\n\nIn addition to \"Sunshine Superman\" and \"Season of the Witch\", Donovan updated three other songs from his canon.

They traveled by canoes between islands to collect food: the men hunted sea lions, while the women dove to collect shellfish.\n\nYaghans share a series of similarities with the more northern tribes of Chonos and Alacalufe. These are a traditional canoe-faring hunter-gatherers lifestyle as well as shared physical traits such as being of short stature, being long-headed (\"Dolichocephalic\") and having a \"low face\". Despite similarities, their languages were completely different.\n\nIn 1871, Anglican missionaries Thomas Bridges and George Lewis established a mission at Tierra del Fuego, where they both raised their families. Bridges had learned the language starting when he lived on Keppel Island at the age of 17. Over more than a decade, he compiled a grammar and a 30,000-word dictionary of Yaghan-English.\n\nBridges' second son, Lucas Bridges, also learned the language and is one of the few Europeans to do so. In his 1948 book, which was a history of that period, he writes that in Yaghan, their autonym or name for themselves was \"yamana\" (meaning \"person\" (though modern usage is man only, not woman) – the plural is \"yamali(m)).\" The name Yaghan (originally and correctly spelled \"Yahgan\"), was first used by his father Thomas Bridges from the name of their territory, Yahgashaga, or Yahga Strait. They called themselves\" Yahgashagalumoala\" (meaning \"people from mountain valley channel\" -lum means 'from', -oala is a collective term for 'men', the singular being ua). It was the name of the inhabitants of the Murray Channel area (\"Yahgashaga\"), from whom Thomas Bridges first learned the language. The name Tekenika (), first applied to a sound in Hoste Island, simply means \"I do not understand\" (from teki- \"see\" and -vnnaka (v schwa) \"have trouble doing\"), and evidently originated as the answer to a misunderstood question.\n\nDespite the extremely cold climate in which they lived, early Yaghan wore little to no clothing until after their extended contact with Europeans. They were able to survive the harsh climate because:\n\nThe Yaghan may have been driven to this inhospitable area by enemies to the north. They were famed for their complete indifference to the bitter weather around Cape Horn. Although they had fire and small domed shelters, they routinely went about completely naked in the frigid cold and biting wind of Tierra del Fuego. Women swam in its extremely cold 48 parallel south waters hunting for shellfish. They often were observed to sleep in the open, completely unsheltered and unclothed, while Europeans shivered under blankets. A Chilean researcher claimed their average body temperature was warmer than a European's by at least one degree.\n\nMateo Martinic, in \"Crónica de las tierras del sur del canal Beagle,\" asserts that there were five groups under the Yahgan people: \"Wakimaala\" on both shores of the Beagle Channel from Yendegaia to Puerto Róbalo and at the Murray Channel; \"Utumaala\" from (today) Puerto Williams to Picton Island; \"Inalumaala\" at the Beagle Channel from Punta Divide to Brecknock; \"Ilalumaala\" in the south west islands, from Cook Bay to False Cape Horn; and \"Yeskumaala\" in the Islands around the Cape Horn.\n\nThe Yaghan established many temporary, but often reused, settlements within Tierra del Fuego. A significant Yaghan archaeological site from the Megalithic period has been found at Wulaia Bay. C. Michael Hogan has called it the \"Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens\".\n\nThe Yaghan left strong impressions on all who encountered them, including Ferdinand Magellan, Charles Darwin, Francis Drake, James Cook, James Weddell and Julius Popper.\n\nSpanish explorers came upon the area around Tierra del Fuego in the early sixteenth century, but it was not until the 19th century that Europeans started to be interested in the zone and its peoples. The Yahgan were estimated to number 3,000 persons in the mid-19th century, when Europeans started colonizing the area.\n\nThe British officer Robert FitzRoy was made captain of in November 1828, and continued her first survey voyage. On the night following 28 January 1830 the ship's whaleboat was stolen by Fuegians, and over a month of fruitless searching to recover the boat he took guides and then prisoners who mostly escaped, eventually taking a man (renamed York Minster, estimated age 26) and a young girl (renamed Fuegia Basket, estimated age 9) hostage. A week later he took another youth hostage (renamed Boat Memory, estimated age 20) and on 11 May captured (estimated to be 14) Jemmy Button. As it was not possible to easily put them ashore, he decided to \"civilise the savages.\" He taught them \"English..the plainer truths of Christianity..and the use of common tools\" and took them with the return of the \"Beagle\" to England. Boat Memory died, but the others were considered \"civilised\" enough to be presented at court in London in the summer of 1831. On the famous second voyage of HMS \"Beagle\", the three Fuegians were returned to their homeland along with a trainee missionary.\n\nThey impressed Charles Darwin with their behaviour, in startling contrast to the \"primitive\" Fuegians he met when the ship reached their native lands. He described his first meeting with the native Fuegians in the islands as being\n\"without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle I ever beheld: I could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilised man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, in as much as in man there is a greater power of improvement.\"In contrast, he said of the Yahgan Jemmy Button: \"It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here.\"\n\nThe mission was set up for the three Fuegians. When the \"Beagle\" returned a year later, its crew found only Jemmy, and he had returned to his tribal ways. He readily still spoke English, assuring them that he \"had not the least wish to return to England\" and was \"happy and contented\" to live with his wife, in what the English thought a shockingly primitive manner. This encounter with the Fuegians had an important influence on Darwin's later scientific work.\n\nThe Yaghan were decimated by the endemic infectious diseases carried by Westerners. The English established missions at Keppel Island in the Falklands, and Ushuaia on Tierra del Fuego, in an effort to teach the natives English, Christianity, and farming. The Yahgan suffered disruption of their habitat starting in the early-to-mid 19th century when European whalers and sealers depleted their most calorie-rich resources, forcing them to rely on mussels chopped from rocks, which provided many fewer calories for the effort needed to gather and process them, in the late 19th century when waves of immigrants came to the area for the gold rush and a boom in sheep farming. They did not understand the British concept of property, and were hunted down by ranchers' militias for the offense of \"poaching\" sheep in their former territories.\n\nIn \"Sailing Alone Around the World\" (1900), Joshua Slocum wrote that when he sailed solo to Tierra del Fuego, European-Chileans warned him the Yaghan might rob and possibly kill him if he moored in a particular area, so he sprinkled tacks on the deck of his boat, the \"Spray.\"\n\nIn the 1920s, some Yahgan were resettled on Keppel Island in the Falkland Islands in an attempt to preserve the tribe, as described by E. Lucas Bridges in \"Uttermost Part of the Earth\" (1948), but they continued to die off. The second-to-last full-blooded Yaghan, Emelinda Acuña, died in 2005. As of 2017, the last full-blooded Yahgan was \"Abuela\" (grandmother) Cristina Calderón, who lives in Chilean territory. She is the last native speaker of the Yahgan language.\n\nAccording to the Chilean census of 2002, there were 1,685 Yaghan in Chile.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2004239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2004239", "title": "Conner Peripherals", "text": "Conner Peripherals\n\nConner Peripherals (commonly referred to as Conner) was a company that manufactured hard drives for personal computers. Conner Peripherals was founded in 1985 by Seagate Technology co-founder and San Jose State University alumnus Finis Conner (1943– ). In 1986, they merged with CoData, a Colorado start-up founded by MiniScribe founders Terry Johnson and John Squires. CoData was developing a new type of small hard disk that put the capacity of a 5.25-inch drive into the smaller (and now commonplace) 3.5-inch format. The CoData drive was the first Conner Peripherals product. The company was partially financed by Compaq, who was also a major customer for many years.\n\nConner's drives were notable for eschewing the \"tub\" type of head-disk assembly, where the disks are inside a large base casting shaped like a square bowl or vault with a flat lid; instead, they preferred the flat base plate approach, which was more resistant to shock and less likely to warp or deform when heated. Their first drives had the base plate carrying the disks, head arm and actuator enclosed inside a long aluminum cartridge, fixed to a bulkhead on the other side with two screws and sealed with a large, square O-ring. Conner's 1/3-height (1-inch thick) drives used a domed, cast aluminum lid with four screws, one on each corner, sealed to the base plate with a rubber gasket. The printed circuit board was bolted to the bottom of the base plate, with the mounting holes for the drive drilled into tabs cast into the sides of the base plate. This design would be Conner's trademark look well into the 1990s.\n\nLogically, Conner's drives had some of the characteristics of the original MiniScribe drives (of which John Squires had also been a designer), with a large amount of intelligence built into the drive's central processing unit (CPU); Conner drives used a single Motorola 68HC11 microcontroller, and ran a proprietary real-time operating system that implemented the track-following algorithms (the \"servo\" system) in software, as well as managing the bus interface. Running these functions in software saved a lot of hardware; in 1986, most drives used a separate PID controller for the spindle, and used a CPU mainly to manage the bus interface and generate positioning pulses for a stepper motor. SCSI support added yet another CPU to interpret the SCSI commands, and track-following servos required analog components that often populated entire circuit boards of their own, thus driving up costs.\n\nAnother cost-saving measure was the ability of the drive to test itself when it was initially powered on after being assembled in the factory. Unlike many competitive products, this required only a power connection, not a dedicated computer or test system.\n\nConner products suffered from lower performance compared to drives that had more on-board buffer memory, or those that spun the media at speeds greater than 3600 RPM, and lower capacity compared to products that utilized zone bit recording (ZBR), to which Conner was slow to adapt. To remedy this, Conner produced a limited number of dual-actuator drives (internally called \"Chinook\") for high-throughput applications. These drives used the SCSI interface and had two independently controlled (by the embedded microprocessor) servo and read/write systems, and two complete sets of read/write heads. The drive firmware enabled it to dynamically reorder commands and assign them to a specific read/write system for optimum execution time, and perform read-write-verify and read-exclusive or-write operations twice as fast as comparable single-actuator systems.\n\nChinook was limited by its physical size — internally it used 3.5-inch disks, but the external dimensions were those of much higher-capacity 5.25-inch drives. Also, RAID systems that used standard drives were dropping in price, making it simpler to use many single-actuator drives with higher capacities together rather than pay more for a smaller-capacity, dual-actuator drive. However, Conner was able to reuse parts of the design in more conventional single-actuator models, and eventually used the dual-CPU architecture to build a line of 7200-RPM drives, the \"CFP4207\" series, in 1995.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, just prior to their buyout by Seagate, Conner Peripherals started using a cost-saving measure on its low-end drives. Instead of bolted-down, cast aluminum lids with rubber gaskets, Conner Peripherals came up with a design that used a thinner stamped aluminum lid, and a thick adhesive tape seal along the perimeter of the lid, where the lip of the lid meets the base casting. This design used no screws to hold on the lid — just cutting the tape could permanently damage the drive by making the lid come off. This design was kept well after the Seagate buyout, and was discontinued in 1999.\n\nConner Peripherals was founded in June 1985 and located in San Jose CA. However it did not produce any product until after it merged into and with CoData, Boulder CO, in February 1986. It began shipping its first products based upon the CoData design in early 1987, initially to Compaq. During calendar 1987 Compaq represented about 90% of Conner Peripheral's sales.\n\nIn 1990, Conner Peripherals set a record by reaching $1.337 billion in sales in four years, without acquisitions, making it the fastest-growing manufacturing start-up in United States history.\n\nConner Peripherals were also one of the first companies to produce IDE specification AV (audio/visual) hard drives for a low cost, such as the 420 megabyte AV in 1995-1996, and was the first to produce drives with a native (no external adapter) IEEE 1394 Firewire interface.\n\nThe company also started manufacturing tape drives in 1993, when it purchased Archive Corporation.\n\nIn 1996, Conner Peripherals was acquired by Seagate.\n\n\n\n"}

It was active in both the United States and Canada. \n\nGreat-West Life was founded in Winnipeg in 1891 by a Jeffrey Hall Brock, a local insurance agent. The company was incorporated on August 28, 1891, with local residents such as James Ashdown on its board. In 1942, it was the first Canadian company \"to enter the accident and health insurance business.\" In 1960, the company moved to Osborne Street, where it had constructed a new building on the site of the old Osborne Stadium. In 1983, the company expanded into a building on the corner of Broadway and Osborne. \n\nIn 1979, US and Canadian operations were separated due mostly to rapid US growth. In 1969 Great-West was purchased by the Power Corporation, which made it into a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1982, Great-West began offering a universal life policy which differed from those offered by competitors. Two years later, in 1984, the Power Financial Corporation was created as a holding company for Great-West and its numerous businesses.\n\nGreat West Life Realty (GWL Realty) is the Toronto-based property and asset management arm of the Great West Life established in 1993.\n\nThe London Life Insurance Company (or London Life) merged with Great-West Life in 1997, then joined the original Canada Life in 2003. London Life was a part of Great-West Lifeco subsidiary, Great-West Life Assurance Company. London Life was founded in London, Ontario, in 1874, and remains headquartered there. In 2009, London Life ranked 14th among Canada's largest private companies. It is best known for its \"Freedom 55\" slogan, which evokes saving money to an extent that would allow one to retire at age 55. The company reportedly had assets under management of $40 billion (Canadian funds) as at December 31, 2004, and 1.9 million participating life insurance policies.\n\nLondon Life merged with its sister companies, Great-West Life Assurance Company and Canada Life Financial under the new brand and the banner of Canada Life. \n\nHugh Cossart Baker, Sr. established the Canada Life Assurance Company (CLAC), the first life insurance company in Canada, on 21 August 1847. The firm was incorporated in 1849. \n\nThe company was acquired by Great-West Life Assurance Company in 2003, after rejecting a hostile takeover bid by rival Manulife. Canada Life Financial had offices in the United Kingdom; in Ireland; Germany; Brazil; the United States; and on the Isle of Man.\n\nThe first CLAC head office was in Hamilton, Ontario on the top floor of the Mechanics' Institute on James Street near Merrick, where the Hamilton City Centre (formerly the Eaton's Centre) now stands. The head office moved in 1883 to King Street East and Hughson Street South (later known as the Birks Building). The company commissioned the building of the Canada Life Building, which was completed in 1895, in Montreal. The headquarters of CLAC was moved to Toronto in 1900 by newly installed company president, George Cox, father of telephone pioneer Hugh Baker. From 1926 to 1929, the company was headquartered at historic Cawthra House in Toronto.\n\nSeveral acquisitions were made and sister companies founded through the years, including:\n\nCrown Life was founded in 1900 and was based in Toronto.

It can be used as clothing for bedridden patients.\n\nHospital gowns worn by patients are designed so that hospital staff can easily access the part of the patient's body being treated.\n\nThe hospital gown is made of fabric that can withstand repeated laundering in hot water, usually cotton, and is fastened at the back with twill tape ties. Disposable hospital gowns may be made of paper or thin plastic, with paper or plastic ties.\n\nSome gowns have snaps along the top of the shoulder and sleeves, so that the gown can be removed without disrupting intravenous lines in the patient's arms.\n\nUsed paper hospital gowns are associated with hospital infections, which could be avoided by proper disposal.\n\nA Canadian study surveying patients at five hospitals determined 57 percent could have worn more clothing below the waist, but only 11 percent wore more than a gown. The physicians conducting the survey said gowns should not be required unless they are necessary. Although they are cheaper and easier to wash, Dr. Todd Lee, of Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, said gowns are not necessary unless the patient is incontinent or has an injury in the lower body. Otherwise, Lee said, pajamas or regular clothes may be acceptable.\n\nMany patients feel that hospital gowns are unfashionable. Joel Sherman in his blog \"Adolescent Boys and Genital Exams Reducing Embarrassment\" says it is quite common for many teenage boys to be upset when changing into a hospital gown, especially if the wearer associates the look of the gown to women's clothing, women's nightgowns, or lingerie.\n\nStudies had been done on updating the garment first used when most patients had to stay in bed, but not designed for modesty when patients got out of bed. NCSU professor Traci Lamar said, \"\"Now doctors want patients up and walking quickly.\" Still, traditional gowns could be washed many times and could be handled a lot. New style gowns and other types of clothing can be more expensive. The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey reported a $70,000 a year increase.\n\nWhen 9-year-old Luke Lange complained about wearing a hospital gown when being treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma, his mother adapted some t-shirts for him to wear, using snap tape on the sides. Other children saw the t-shirt and wanted one too. Two years later, the organization Luke's FastBreaks had raised $1 million for children's cancer and given out over 5000 of the t-shirts. They were long enough to wear like the gowns, but some preferred to wear them like t-shirts. Briton Lynn, executive director of Luke's FastBreaks, said the t-shirts helped children have a more positive attitude.\n\nIn November 2006, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave a $236,000 grant to a team at North Carolina State University to design a new gown based on \"style, cost, durability, comfort, function\" and other qualities. NCSU professor Lamar's team worked to come up with a \"more comfortable, less revealing\" design. Surveys found that nurses did not like the ties in the back because knots could form, and some patients wore more than one gown at once, with one tied in front and the other in back. Many patients disliked how lightweight gowns were. In April 2009, the NCSU team showed potential new designs at a reception, and they were preparing to ask for more funding as they developed a prototype. Meanwhile, some hospitals were offering alternatives, including gowns that opened in the front or on the side, and drawstring pants, cotton tops and boxers. These cost more than traditional gowns. Lamar's additional funding came from RocketHub. At NCSU Fashion Week in 2013, Lamar's design was mentioned as \"functional and dignified,\" but not shown \"to prevent any patent infringements\". A prototype, made of DermaFabric and made at Precision Fabrics in Greensboro, North Carolina, was to be tested at WakeMed.\n\nIn 2009, Fatima Ba-Alawi was honored for her DCS (dignity, comfort, safety) gown at a RCN conference on London. Four years after she started using her skills making dresses to redesign hospital gowns, NHS trusts were using the design. The reversible gowns have plastic poppers which make it easier to change without moving the patient and save staff time, and side pockets for drips or catheters, along with a pouch for cardio equipment. One version called the Faith Gown has a detachable head scarf and long sleeves.\n\nAnother redesign in England came from Ben de Lisi, one of six receiving grants. The Design Council was scheduled to show his design, which did not open in the back but did allow access, in March 2010.\n\nAccording to the BBC, de Lisi's hospital gowns are made much more modestly, taking patient dignity into consideration.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic changed its gowns in 2010 because the CEO had heard many complaints. Diane von Furstenberg was commissioned to design stylish hospital gowns based on her fashionable wrap dress by the Cleveland Clinic. The new design was reversible with a V-neck in both the front and the back, with softer fabric.\n\nBirmingham Children's Hospital in England introduced the polyester/cotton Dignity Giving Suit in March 2013, after 18 months of work. Patients and health care professionals liked the suits with Velcro fasteners on the seams. Other area hospitals were interested.

Morricone's orchestration often calls for an unusual combination of instruments, voices, and whistling. Alessandroni's twangy guitar riff is central to the main theme for \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\". Alessandroni can be heard as the whistler on the soundtracks for Sergio Leone's films, including \"A Fistful of Dollars\", \"For a Few Dollars More\", \"Once Upon a Time in the West\", and \"Pervirella\".\n\nAlessandroni founded the octet vocal group ' (English: \"The Modern Choristers\") in 1961. The group, which included his wife, , performed wordless vocals on several Italian movie soundtracks.

His novels, \"The Outward Room\" (1938) and \"Savage Sleep\" (1968), addressed mental health institutions and were bestsellers in their day.\n\nBrand was born on January 19, 1906, in Jersey City, New Jersey, into a working-class family. He was of Pennsylvania Dutch descent on his mother’s side. He graduated from Columbia University in 1929. He resided in Greenwich Village and on a small farm in Bally, Pennsylvania. He married twice; first to Pauline Leader, a poet noted for her memoir about growing up deaf, \"And No Birds Sing\", and then to Helen Mendelssohn; both marriages ended in divorce. He had three children by his first marriage and one by his second.\n\nAfter graduating from Columbia, Brand began work as a psychiatric aide and also a copywriter for the New York Telephone Company before accepting faculty posts at the University of New Hampshire and New York University, where he taught writing fiction. Brand was an editor at Crown Publishers for about twenty years, starting in the early 1950s, where he edited works by Indian social-realist novelist Bhabani Bhattacharya.\n\nIn 1935, Brand joined the League of American Writers (1935-1943), whose members included Alexander Trachtenberg, Frank Folsom, Louis Untermeyer, I.F. Stone, Myra Page, Arthur Miller, Lillian Hellman, and Dashiell Hammett. Members were sympathetic to the U.S. Communist Party.\n\nIn 1937, Brand wrote his first and most noted novel, \"The Outward Room,\" based in part on his experience as a psychiatric aide. The novel was a bestseller and was adapted for Broadway as \"The World We Make.\" He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Writing (Screenplay) in 1948 for \"The Snake Pit\" (with Frank Partos), an adaptation of Mary Jane Ward's novel, which like his novel, \"The Outward Room\", involved confinement in a mental health institution. \n\nBrand described the Pennsylvania Dutch culture in \"Fields of Peace: A Pennsylvania German Album\" (1970)—with photography by George Tice—and in \"Local Lives\" (1975), a book of poems about his Pennsylvania Dutch neighbors, compiled over the span of his working life.\n\nBrand was active in the peace movement. Toward the end of his life, he was active in a movement to open up major poetry publications to writers of color and younger writers, through his friendship with the Caribbean-American poet, essayist, teacher, and activist, June Jordan.\n\nIn 1953, Brand was required to appear before the U.S. Senate Investigations subcommittee, chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy, at which appearance he refused to testify against his colleagues in the League of American Writers, citing the Fifth Amendment. Consequently, his works were among those banned from U.S. State Department libraries, abroad.\n\n\n"}

This theory, created and developed mostly by Tendai monks, was never systematized, but was nonetheless very pervasive and very influential. The book had thereafter great influence over literature and the arts.\n\nThe book is believed to have been written during the late Nanboku-chō period, either during the Bunna or the Enbun era. It carries the note but who exactly wrote it is unclear. Divided in ten volumes and 50 chapters, it supports the Tendai and Ise Shinto \"honji suijaku\" theory according to which Japanese \"kami\" were simply local manifestations of the Indian gods of Buddhism. This theory was never systematized, but became nonetheless the most important tool through which foreign Buddhism was reconciled with local \"kami\" beliefs. The book illustrates it through tales dedicated to various shrines and to the Buddhist gods which are the true nature of the \"kami\" they enshrine. It deals mostly with shrines located west of Tonegawa in Kōzuke province (like Akagi Daimyōjin, Ikaho Daimyōjin and Komochiyama Daimyōjin), the Kumano Sanzan and other Kantō shrines, explaining the reason for their \"kami's\" rebirths, and telling tales about their previous lives.\n\nThe common point of the tales is that, before being reborn as a tutelary \"kami\" of an area, a person has first to be born and suffer there as a human being. The suffering is mostly caused by relationships with relatives, especially wives or husbands.\n\nThe book had a great impact on the literature and arts of the following centuries.\n"}

She was one of the most widely read and highest paid female writers in the United States for nearly fifty years, from 1911 to 1959. Norris was a prolific writer who wrote 93 novels, many of which became best sellers. Her stories appeared frequently in the popular press of the day, including \"Atlantic\", \"The American Magazine\", \"McClure's\", \"Everybody's\", \"Ladies' Home Journal\" and \"Woman's Home Companion.\" Norris used her fiction to promote family and moralistic values, such as the sanctity of marriage, the nobility of motherhood, and the importance of service to others.\n\nKathleen Thompson Norris was born in San Francisco, California on 16 July 1880. Her parents were Josephine (née Moroney) and James Alden Thompson. When she was 19 both her parents died. As the oldest sibling she became effectively the head of a large family and had to work. Initially, she found employment in a department store, which was soon followed by work in an accounting office and then the Mechanic's Institute Library. In 1905, she enrolled in a creative writing program at the University of California, Berkeley and began writing short stories. The San Francisco Call, which had published a few of her stories, hired her to write a society column in September 1906. In the course of that work she met Charles Gilman Norris (whose late older brother was the famous novelist Frank Norris), and they soon fell in love. He moved to New York to be art editor of The American Magazine. After eight months of daily correspondence and some improvements in her family's financial situation, she joined him there and they were married in April 1909.\n\nShe resumed writing short stories, which began to appear in newspapers and then magazines starting in 1910. Charles took on a lifelong role as Kathleen's literary agent, and also took care of many household management roles as she became increasingly successful as a writer. Shortly after becoming a new mother, she wrote her first novel, \"Mother.\" It started as a short story in The American Magazine in 1911. A publisher asked her to expand it into a novelette, which became a national sensation and earned the praise of Theodore Roosevelt for its celebration of large families. A devout Catholic, she wrote the book in part as a commentary against birth control, which was rapidly influencing women's attitudes about motherhood. Her 1914 novel \"Saturday's Child\" received a positive, lengthy review from William Dean Howells, who remarked on her sensitivity to class issues.\n\nNorris became involved in various social causes, including women's suffrage, Prohibition, pacifism, and organizations to benefit children and the poor.\n\nMany of her novels were made into films, including \"Butterfly\" (1924), \"My Best Girl\" (1927), \"The Callahans and the Murphys\" (1927), \"Passion Flower\" (1930), and \"Change of Heart\" (1934, based on the novel \"Manhattan Love Song\").\n\nSome of Norris's novels were adapted for a radio series, \"By Kathleen Norris\", making her \"the first nationally famous writer to have her works brought to radio listeners as a daily serial program.\" The program, produced by Phillips Lord, was broadcast on CBS October 9, 1939 - September 26, 1941.\n\nKathleen Thompson Norris died January 18, 1966 in San Francisco at the home of her son Dr. Frank Norris. She was 85.\n\nIn 1919 the family moved to a ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains near Saratoga, California, adjacent to the Villa Montalvo estate of James Duval Phelan. They later built a house in Palo Alto and spent summers at the ranch. Kathleen's sister Teresa, who had married William Rose Benét and borne three children, died in 1919. Kathleen fought for and eventually obtained guardianship of the two nieces and a nephew, Rosemary, Kathleen Anne and James Benét.\n\nHer granddaughter Kathleen Norris (San Francisco 1 Mar 1935-San Francisco 8 Dec 1967) was the second wife of Prince Andrew Romanov (b.

The episode was written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with David R. Goodman, and directed by Parker. In the episode, South Park Elementary's dodgeball team travels to China to compete for the dodgeball championship, while the town of South Park pays tribute to the school nurse, who is living with conjoined twin myslexia.\n\nPip, tired of being bullied, hits Kyle with a ball during dodgeball, giving him a nose bleed. Kyle is sent to Nurse Gollum, only to discover that she has a dead fetus attached to her head, due to a condition called conjoined twin myslexia. Kyle tells the others and they react in disgust, making fun of her. Kyle's mother, Sheila, attempts to educate the boys on Nurse Gollum's condition, but is confronted by an irate Sharon Marsh. Sheila, in order to remedy the unawareness apparent in people of conjoined twin myslexia, decides to help the woman, and winds up causing a \"Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week\" declared in South Park for its sole sufferer.\n\nMeanwhile, the school dodgeball team becomes eligible for competitions, and goes on to fight the state competition in Denver. South Park ends up winning because Pip becomes filled with rage whenever others bully him, giving him the strength to take down the other team. In the national competition, the Washington, D.C. team forfeits because of their fear of the inevitable international opponent, China, who are brutal and merciless at dodgeball. In China, the team is dismantled until Pip is the only one left. After they are tricked into teasing him, Pip single-handedly annihilates the entire Chinese team with one throw, but by this point, everyone has decided they do not want to play dodgeball anymore.\n\nIn South Park, after a week of festivities, a parade is held for Nurse Gollum to give a speech. She finally snaps at the crowd that all she wants is to be treated normally and that calling this kind of attention is aggravating and counter-productive and storms off, much to their annoyance.\n\nAll 18 episodes of the second season, including \"Conjoined Fetus Lady\", were released on a DVD box set on June 3, 2003.\n\n"}

The two anterior cerebral arteries arise from the internal carotid artery and are part of the circle of Willis. The left and right anterior cerebral arteries are connected by the anterior communicating artery.\n\nAnterior cerebral artery syndrome refers to symptoms that follow a stroke occurring in the area normally supplied by one of the arteries. It is characterized by weakness and sensory loss in the lower leg and foot opposite to the lesion and behavioral changes.\n\nThe anterior cerebral artery is divided into 5 segments. Its smaller branches: the callosal (supracallosal) arteries are considered as the A4 and A5 segments.\n\n\nThe anterior cerebral artery develops from a primitive anterior division of the internal carotid artery that initially supplies the optic and olfactory regions. This anterior division, which appears at the twenty-eighth day of development, also forms the middle cerebral artery and the anterior choroidal artery. The anterior cerebral arteries grow toward each other and form the anterior communicating artery at the 21–24 mm stage of the embryo.\n\nThe anterior cerebral artery shows considerable variation. In a study made using MRA, the most common variation was an underdeveloped A1 segment (5.6%), followed by the presence of an extra A2 segment (3%). In 2% of cases there was only one A2 segment.\nThe anterior cerebral artery supplies a part of the frontal lobe, specifically its medial surface and the upper border. It also supplies the front four–fifths of the corpus callosum, and provides blood to deep structures such as the anterior limb of the internal capsule, part of the caudate nucleus, and the anterior part of the globus pallidus.\n\nStrokes that occur in a part of the artery prior to the anterior communicating usually do not produce many symptoms because of collateral circulation. If a blockage occurs in the A2 segment or later, the following signs and symptoms may be noted:\n\n\n\n"}
