Schulz based on the \"Peanuts\" comic strip. The film marks the on-screen debut of Woodstock, who had first appeared in the strip in 1967. It was the only Peanuts film during composer Vince Guaraldi’s lifetime that did not have a score composed by him. Its music was composed by the Sherman Brothers, who composed the music for various Disney films like \"Mary Poppins\" (1964), \"The Jungle Book\" (1967), and \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" (1971). The film was released on August 9, 1972 by National General Pictures, produced by Lee Mendelson Films and Cinema Center Films (in the latter's final production).\n\nSnoopy and the rest of the \"Peanuts\" gang go to the beach for the day. Once there, Snoopy promises to go back to the beach the next day to meet up with Peppermint Patty. After Charlie Brown has gone home to play \"Monopoly\" with the others, he notices Snoopy is late and remarks he is tired of Snoopy being late. Charlie Brown vents his frustrations at Snoopy, who silences him by taking off his collar. The next day, Snoopy is thrown off the beach due to a new \"No Dogs Allowed on this beach\" rule (thus setting a running gag in the film). Then Snoopy gets thrown out of a library due to his disruptive behavior and another \"No Dogs Allowed in library\" rule. He then takes out his anger by getting into a fight with Linus over his blanket, and later beats, and kisses Lucy in a boxing match.\n\nLater, Snoopy receives a letter from a girl named Lila, who has been in the hospital for three weeks for unspecified reasons and needs Snoopy to keep her company. Upon receiving the letter, Snoopy immediately sets off with Woodstock to go see her, leaving Charlie Brown completely in the dark as to who Lila is. Linus decides to do some investigating, and discovers that Lila is Snoopy's original owner; Charlie Brown faints upon hearing this.\n\nEn route to see Lila, Snoopy and Woodstock are forced to face the challenges of a world full of signs declaring \"No Dogs Allowed.\" Each instance - on a bus, a train, and elsewhere - is musically accented by the deep tones of Thurl Ravenscroft. The pair are briefly adopted as pets by an animal-obsessed girl (identified as Clara in the theatrical poster, the soundtrack album's back cover and label, and closed captioning), and she ties Snoopy up. Then Clara locks Woodstock in a cage while he's trying to save Snoopy. Clara's mother lets her keep the beagle; Clara is so excited to have Snoopy (whom she calls \"Rex\") as her \"sheepdog\". She bathes him (and he tries to escape, but fails) and dresses him up. Clara starts a tea party, but Snoopy escapes Clara's clutches and tries to call for help, but Clara catches him, takes his dress off, and ties him up again. Then Clara tells Snoopy, \"Mom says, if I'm gonna keep you, I gotta take you to the vet for a check up. You probably need about a dozen shots.\" \nClara walks Snoopy to the vet and when they get there, he causes a fight and escapes. He returns to Clara's house and frees Woodstock, but Clara returns and a chases ensues until she ends up with a full fishbowl stuck on her head, prompting their escape. Later that evening, Snoopy and Woodstock camp out, play football and make music while preparing dinner.\n\nSnoopy finally reaches the hospital, but again no dogs are allowed inside. To add further insult, the hospital does not allow birds to enter either. Snoopy is foiled in his first attempt to sneak into Lila's room, but his second attempt is successful. He then keeps Lila company for the rest of his stay. Lila tells Snoopy that his visit helped her to get better. She then asks Snoopy to go home with her, but he has doubts about this idea. Snoopy decides to go back home to Charlie Brown. However, when he sees Lila watching him tearfully from her hospital window, Snoopy finds that it's too hard to leave her and he runs back to her, which she takes as a sign that he wants to live with her. But first, he needs to return to \"settle his affairs\" and say goodbye. Snoopy writes a letter directing that certain items of his will be given away: Linus is given his croquet and chess sets, while Schroeder receives Snoopy's record collection.\n\nThe kids throw Snoopy a large, tearful going-away party, each one bringing a gift. The kids closest to Snoopy get up to say a few words in his honor. But when it is Charlie Brown's turn to speak, he is overwhelmed to the point of silence. After giving Snoopy his present, he finally wails out in pain with Snoopy doing likewise. The rest of the gang, even Lucy, eventually follows suit when Schroeder plays \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\" on his piano.\n\nAfter Snoopy leaves, Charlie Brown is unable to sleep or eat. When Snoopy arrives at Lila's apartment building the next day, he sees a sign next to the front door that says \"No dogs allowed in this building\". Snoopy is overjoyed that this gives him an excuse to return to Charlie Brown. Lila arrives and Snoopy is reluctantly introduced to her pet cat. Snoopy shows Lila the sign, and Lila has no choice but to allow Snoopy to leave. Snoopy leaves Lila behind and joyfully returns to Charlie Brown and the others.\n\nBack home, the children are overjoyed to see Snoopy return, carrying him on high to his dog house. Once there, using his typewriter, Snoopy demands that the kids return the items he had given them before he left, turning their feelings to annoyance. Charlie Brown reads his document and tells the gang, \"Mine says, that since he gave me \"nothing\", I owe \"him\" nothing.\"\nLucy then snaps, \"That does it, Charlie Brown! He's \"your\" dog \"and you're welcome to him\"!\" \nThe gang then leaves Charlie Brown and Snoopy together, then Charlie Brown walks crossly away. The film ends with end credits being typed out by Woodstock as Snoopy dictates.\n\n\nPatty, Pig-Pen, Violet, Franklin, Shermy, Roy, and 5 appear but had no lines.\n\n\"Snoopy, Come Home\" marked the first time Snoopy's thoughts are fully communicated to the audience outside of the comic strip. This was achieved by having his typed correspondences appear at the top of the frame, giving the viewer full access to his thoughts. Previously, Schulz had opted to mute Snoopy entirely, except for inflected squealing and growling. Snoopy's thought balloons, though overt in the strip, are not translated in the animated projects.\n\n\"Snoopy, Come Home\" was the only \"Peanuts\" animated project produced during Vince Guaraldi's lifetime (1928–1976) that did not contain a musical score by the noted jazz composer. Guaraldi had composed all the previous \"Peanuts\" animated television specials as well as the debut film \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\". Music for this film was instead provided by the Sherman Brothers, who had composed some of the music used in various Disney films and theme park attractions. Schulz said this was an experiment, as he had wanted to have more of a commercial \"Disney\" feel to \"Snoopy, Come Home\". Schulz later said he would have utilized Guaraldi's services for the third \"Peanuts\" feature, \"Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown\", had the composer not died suddenly in February 1976. A soundtrack was released by Columbia Masterworks, but is now out of print.\n\n\nThe film was released on August 9, 1972 by National General Pictures, produced by Lee Mendelson Films and Cinema Center Films (in the latter's final production). It was first televised on November 5, 1976 as a CBS Special Film Presentation becoming a CBS feature special.\n\n\"Snoopy, Come Home\" grossed $245,073 at the box office, against a $1,000,000 budget. , the film held a 92% rating on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 12 reviews with an average score of 7.8/10. \"The New York Times \"said: \"This sprightly, clever and hilarious treat—all that a comic strip could be on the screen—is even better than \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown,\" which began the series.\"\n\nThe film won a CEC Award for Best Children's Film becoming its first recipient.\n\nThe film was released on VHS, CED, and LaserDisc in 1984, 1985, February 20, 1992, 1995 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, and May 29, 2001 on VHS by Paramount Home Entertainment, and re-released on DVD in anamorphic widescreen in the U.S. on March 28, 2006, by Paramount Home Entertainment/CBS Home Entertainment (CBS owned Cinema Center Films, which co-produced the film). The film was released on Blu-ray in September 2015 along with \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\".\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\nEnrile's economy is driven by our agriculture industry, primarily the production of rice, corn, peanuts and mongo crops. Our high school and college graduates have the largest percentage of graduation and promotion to professional occupations in the entire province. In the last 15-years, our community has dramatically risen from a 6th class designation to our current classification of three.\n\nThe municipality was named after Spanish governor-general Pasqual Enrile y Alcedo.\n\nCabug was the original name of Enrile when it was a barrio of Tuguegarao. It was established as a separate town in September 1849 and named in honor of the Spanish Governor General Pascual Enrile during the Spanish regime.\n\nEnrile lies on the southernmost part of Cagayan, bounded by Sta. Maria, Isabela to the south, by the mighty Cagayan River  to the east, by Solana and Tuguegarao to the north, Kalinga to the west.\n\nEnrile is predominantly an agricultural town where the majority of its population derive their income from farming. It has a land area of 18,450 hectares unevenly distributed to the 22-barangays of the municipality. Its main products are rice, corn, peanut, tobacco and vegetables.\n\nEnrile has a total population of 35, 834 inhabitants. Its citizens are called Itawit because they speak the Itawit dialect. Ilocanos and Tagalogs have settled at the western barangays and have blended very well in the mainstream of Itawit life.\n\nEnrile is a community of simple and hardworking people. While Enrile has limited natural resources, it takes pride in its human resources. Almost every family in the community has a member that is of the professional class. Enrile is best known as community of intellectuals having the highest literacy rate among all municipalities in the province.\n\nThe History of Enrile dates as early as 1690. According to Father Juan Paguere, it was just a wide and long stretch of virgin land located at the southern most end of the province of Cagayan. In 1718, the Govierno Superior ordered the place to become one of the barrios of Tuguegarao. It was named “Cabugag” or in short Cabug, the dialect term for hunchback for the first settler was a man with this deformity. So the place was named after him. The name “Cabug” is engraved on the town’s first church bell which is still found in the steeple.\n\nIn 1724, The Dominican Friars have thought of giving the barrios their Patron Saint. Cabug was given “Nuestra Señora de las Caldas”. The old prominent residents of the barrio had chosen the sixth day of August as her feast day. As year went by, the land area and population of the barrio increased with surprising rapidly. The Cagayan River which flowed close to the barrio site gradually changed its course and moved further towards Cataggaman as flood plains were formed. The non Christian inhabitants called Kalingas gradually deserted the barrio and moved westward to the Mountain Province. As a result, more agricultural lands were cleared and cultivated. Tobacco and corn are the chief crops of the people.\n\nIn September 1849, the Govierno Superior ordered the separation of Cabug from the municipality of Tuguegarao to become a town by itself. The new town was named Enrile in honor of Governor Pascual Enrile who was responsible for building roads in the northern part of Luzon during those days. The separation of Enrile from Tuguegarao led to a change of its patron saint. The population unanimously adopted “Nuestra Señora de las Nieves” as its patron Saint. The fifth day of August was selected as her feast day. Since then the feast day had always been celebrated pompously.\n\nAccording to Father Julian Malumbres in his Historia de Cagayan, the name “Cabug” was first recorded in the official documents of the Dominican Fathers on January 20, 1849. However the town was known as “Cabug” even up 1863 when the name Enrile was officially written and road in the official documents of the Dominican Fathers. Cabug was the original name of Enrile when it was a barrio of Tuguegarao. It was established as a separate town in September 1849 and named in honor of the Spanish Governor General Pascual Enrile during the Spanish regime.\n\nEnrile lies on the southernmost part of Cagayan, bounded by Sta.

And although the name Enrile was officially written and read in the records of the Dominicans up to 1863, the town of Enrile was still known as “Cabug”.\n\nKalingas, the early settlers, were later joined by neighbor inhabitants in the cleaning and cultivating its rich soil. They plowed and planted the fields with staple products and tobacco.\n\nWith the increasing production and number of educated elders, the Gobierno Superior proclaimed “Cabug” separated from Tuguegarao City in 1849, with a new patroness named Nuestra Senoŕa de las Nieves.\n\nThis proclaimed “Cabug” as “Enrile” in honor of Gobernardo General Pascual Enrile, who was responsible for the construction of Luzon’s highways.\n\nSinupac, a hinterland of Enrile, was the hiding place of Emilio Aguinaldo and his revolutionary forces when they retreated from pursuing American forces.\n\nToday the town of Enrile not only boasts of its peaceful,orderly conditions and its competent professionals, but also of its rapidly growing hog and poultry industry.\n\nA.

DA Assistant Secretary for Agribusiness Leandro Gazmin, who went to Enrile to represent Alcala during the peanut harvest ceremony, said the soil suitability of the town – sandy to sandy-loam – and its unique ability to produce peanut year-round are the “primary reasons why it will be known as an important source of peanut henceforth.”\n\nGazmin said the Secretary lauds them for their collective effort but that the DA chief requests that they “commit themselves to improve and develop even further not just the peanut industry but the entire agricultural sector as well.”\n\nHe said the Secretary is also happy to know that farmers have been receptive to new technologies hence, they are able to increase productivity from 1.5 to 1.8 tons per hectare.\n\nDuring the peanut harvest, the DA regional office turned over to the local government of Enrile over P4-million worth of farm machineries and equipment, including one unit four-wheel drive tractor, four units of mill for corngrits, 10 heads of carabao, 2,500 kilos of peanut seeds for planting and 300 bags of open-pollinated corn variety.\n\nThough peanut is considered a high value crop by DA, not just in Enrile but in neighboring towns of Peñablanca and Tuguegarao (Cagayan) and Sta. Maria and Cabagan in Isabela, the former was chosen as “number one” for having the “highest production share of 1,800 metric tons per year or 8 to10 percent of the national supply.”\n\nAlso, Enrile is the only municipality that can cultivate peanuts during the dry and wet season cropping, the DA said.\n\nDA Region II Executive Director Lucrecio Alviar said that per cropping, the town of Enrile is able to produce a big chunk of the national production, making it the major source of raw materials for various peanut-based products processed and sold in Metro Manila.\n\nEnrile is home to 800 peanut farmers cultivating 700 hectares of farmlands with a potential expansion area of another 800 hectares. “With improved production and yield, Enrile may be able to fill up a portion, if not all, of the import requirement for peanut of 15,060 metric tons,” Alviar added.\n\nWith the use of technology from DA and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) – particularly the use of improved varieties and fertilizers like Boron and Gypsum – the DA is optimistic that “peanut production could reach an all-time high of 3.25 tons per hectare,” or an increase of 200 percent over its current average. The DA said it hopes the farmers can sustain their productivity.\n\nGazmin also encouraged peanut farmers to bring their harvest to the Isabela Agri-Pinoy Trading Center, where they can directly sell their produce. The Isabela APTC is part of the government’s effort to empower farmers to become traders to enhance their incomes, stabilize food prices and encourage them to produce more. “Let us utilize the center as a venue for cooperativism” and enabling each other to produce and earn more, he said.\n\nPassenger jeepneys, tricycles and other private transportation vehicles service all routes within and outside Enrile.

Another attraction of Gattaran is Bolos Point, a wildlife sanctuary.\n\nIn the place where Gattaran lies today were three former ecclesiastical towns: Nassiping, Dummun, and Gattaran proper. Nassiping is the oldest among the three, founded on June 15, 1596 with Santa Catalina as the patron saint; Dummun was founded on May 24, 1598 and Gattaran, May 20, 1623. Since each of these towns had few inhabitants and had only one priest to administer to their religious needs, they were merged for ecclesiastical convenience into one municipality in 1877 by virtue of a Diocesan Order from the Bishop of Nueva Segovia (Lallo). Fray Francisco Suejos, O.P. was the first Gobernadorcillo.\n\nDuring the Spanish regime, the natives grew spiritually; but with the Americans, they grew educationally and the inhabitants assimilated a more sophisticated lifestyle. Under the Commonwealth Government, the first Municipal Mayor was Melencio Adviento, who begun the construction of the present municipal building. The building was finished during the term of the next mayor, Atty. Hipolito Mandac. The municipal building was inaugurated in September, 1941. Four months after its inauguration, World War II broke out, the Japanese Forces occupied the town and all records, cadastral titles and others were confiscated by the invading forces.\n\nWith the coming of the Americans to adding Filipino soldiers under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary, the whole province was liberated from the Japanese forces. The first election of the Republic in 1947 made Delfino Liban the mayor. The administration marked the building of roads in the barrios, improvements of streets and others.\n\nIn 1950, the barrios of Gattaran to the west of the Cagayan River was separated to form the town of Lasam.\n\nIn the classical era, Gattaran used to be the home of hunter-gatherers who specialized in hunting mollusks. These hunter-gatherers have stockpiled their leftover mollusk shells in numerous sites in Gattaran and neighboring Lal-lo, until eventually, the shells formed into largest stock of shell-midden sites in the entire Philippines.\n\nIn 2006, the shell-midden sites of Gattaran and Lal-lo were included in the UNESCO Tentative List for World Heritage Site inclusion, a step closer to becoming a world heritage site.

In December 1956, the paper's financial condition was so bad that McCloskey got permission from the unions for a 90 percent cut in the workforce.\n\nIn 1957, McCloskey sold the paper to Walter Annenberg, publisher of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\". Annenberg killed off the \"Daily News\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> Sunday edition and made the tabloid into an afternoon paper.\n\nIn 1969, Annenberg sold both papers to Knight Newspapers Inc., which eventually became Knight Ridder following a merger. Under the new ownership, the \"Daily News\" returned to morning publication and aimed to be taken more seriously. The paper's journalists have won the Pulitzer Prize three times. Richard Aregood won in 1985 for editorial writing, Signe Wilkinson won for her editorial cartoons in 1992 and Barbara Laker and Wendy Ruderman won in 2010 for investigating reporting for their \"Tainted Justice\" series focusing on the alleged misdeeds of a rogue narcotics squad.\n\nThe paper continues to struggle financially. It was surpassed in circulation, but not readership, by the free daily \"Metro\". When the sale of Knight Ridder to The McClatchy Company was announced in March 2006, there were rumors that McClatchy would close the \"Daily News\". However, in May, before the sale was finalized, it was announced that the \"Inquirer\" and \"Daily News\" would be re-sold to Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C., a local group led by advertising executive Brian Tierney and co-founder of the Toll Brothers homebuilding firm, Bruce Toll. The deal became official on June 29, 2006. The group intended to strengthen the online presence of both papers, and began an extensive ad campaign.\n\nFalling circulation and ad revenue caused Philadelphia Media Holdings to make the \"Daily News\" into an edition of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\". Without making any other changes to the \"Daily News\", making it part of \"The Inquirer\" would combine the circulation numbers of both papers by the Audit Bureau of Circulation. The idea was to make the newspapers more attractive to advertisers. On April 14, 2010 Brian Tierney announced that the \"Daily News\" would launch a weekend edition in October. The weekend edition's content would be similar to the daily edition, but would have features that would not be time sensitive and be able to be read anytime during the week.\n\nIn early 2009, debts from buying the newspapers forced Philadelphia Newspapers LLC into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy was the beginning of a year-long dispute between Philadelphia Media Holdings and creditors. The group of creditors, which include banks and hedge funds, wanted to take control of Philadelphia Newspapers LLC themselves and oppose efforts by Philadelphia media Holdings to keep control. Philadelphia Media Holdings received support from most of the paper's unions and launched a public relations campaign to promote local ownership.\n\nA bankruptcy auction was held on April 28, 2010. The group of lending creditors and a group of local investors allied with Brian Tierney both bid for Philadelphia Newspapers, but the lenders had the winning bid. The lenders' company, Philadelphia Media Network, took control later that year. In July 2012, after selling the Inquirer Building in 2011, the \"Daily News\" along with \"The Inquirer\" and Philly.com moved their offices to the 3rd floor of the old Strawbridge & Clothier department store on East Market Street.\n\nIn 2019, Philadelphia Media Network renamed Philly.com Inquirer.com and made the \"Daily News\" an edition of the \"Inquirer\". Philadelphia Media Network was renamed The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC.\n\nThe George Fencl Award, named in honor of Philadelphia Police Officer George Fencl, is given by the \"Daily News\" to a Philadelphia Police Officer who exemplifies compassion, fairness, and civic commitment. The award was first given in 1986.\n\nThe \"Daily News\" named its first Sportsperson of the Year in 2008.\n\n\nThe \"Philadelphia Daily News\" prices are: $2.95 Monday-Saturday, as of 4/1/2019.\n\n"}

Finally, as of December 18, 2019, the United States Court of International Trade has more Democratic appointees than Republican appointees. However, the party of the president who appointed a judge is not always a good indicator of that judge's judicial philosophy and place on the political spectrum.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States was established by the Constitution of the United States.\nOriginally, the Judiciary Act of 1789 set the number of justices at six. Subsequently, the United States Congress increased the number of justices to seven in 1807, nine in 1837, and ten in 1863. The Judicial Circuits Act of 1866 set the number at seven to be achieved gradually through retirement or death of current associate justices. The court was down to eight when the Judiciary Act of 1869 restored the number to nine.\n\nThe United States Courts of Appeals were established by the Judiciary Act of 1891 as \"United States circuit courts of appeals\" (the name was changed to its current form in 1948).

It was the fourth full-length feature film to be based on the \"Peanuts\" comic strip.\n\n\"Peanuts\" creator Charles M. Schulz wrote that he came up with the idea for the story while visiting the Château Malvoisin, where he was stationed briefly as a soldier during World War II. The castle plays a large role in the film.\n\nThe movie uses the same voice cast that worked on the 1977 Peanuts television special \"It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown\", the 1979 Peanuts television special \"You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown\", and the 1980 Peanuts television special \"She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown\". This film contains a rare occurrence where the adults appear on screen, including having their faces entirely visible, as well as speaking comprehensible lines.\n\nParamount Home Entertainment released this film on VHS and Laserdisc in 1995 in 4:3 format, and released it to DVD (cropped to widescreen) on October 6, 2015.\nThis film came three years after \"Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown\" and would be the last traditionally animated \"Peanuts\" film from the Bill Melendez studio. The characters would not return to film until 2015's computer-animated \"The Peanuts Movie\".\n\nThree years after the film's release, a 1983 television special, \"What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?\", brought the Peanuts gang to memorials and places related to World Wars I and II.\n\nAt Charlie Brown's school, Linus Van Pelt introduces to his class two French students, Babette and Jacques, who will be spending two weeks there in order to get accustomed to the United States. In exchange, Charlie Brown and Linus are chosen to go to France. Charlie Brown heads home and invites Snoopy and Woodstock to go with him. He gets a call from Peppermint Patty, who tells him that she and Marcie were also chosen to go to France as a student exchange. Charlie Brown also gets a letter from France, but can’t read it because it’s written in French. At the airport, Sally tells Charlie Brown to try to do something right to represent the school. As the gang watches him, Linus, Marcie, Peppermint Patty, and Snoopy depart, Sally, PigPen, Violet, and Schroder call, \"Bon voyage, Charlie Brown!\", before Lucy adds, \"And don't come back!!!\" However, Charlie Brown is not very positive about the trip because of the letter he got. Marcie, who has been studying French, translates it. The letter says that he’s been invited to stay at a fictional French chateau, the \"Château du Mal Voisin\" (French: \"House of the Bad Neighbor\").\n\nThey arrive first in London, where Snoopy leaves the group temporarily to play tennis at Wimbledon, where the beagle gets in a dispute with the referee for a judgment call about the ball being in or out. He loses his temper, causing him to be banned from the grounds. When they arrive across the English Channel in France via hovercraft, they pick up a Citroën 2CV, which must be driven by Snoopy as none of the others have a drivers' licence, though Snoopy enjoys grinding the gears out of it. Upon their arrival, the four go to their respective homes. Patty and Marcie go to stay at a farm, where they meet a boy named Pierre, who immediately attracts their attention. It is obvious that Marcie and Pierre have a spark between them - obvious to everyone except Patty, who manages to convince herself that Pierre likes \"her\". Meanwhile, Charlie Brown, Linus, Snoopy, and Woodstock go to the chateau, which they find is apparently abandoned, though somebody keeps leaving food for them and making their beds after they leave for school. In reality, the chateau is owned by an unfriendly baron, and the person leaving Charlie Brown and Linus food is the baron's kindly niece, Violette Honfleur.\n\nEventually, Linus manages to track Violette down and demand what is going on. Violette says that although her uncle is irritable, she must remember what a U.S. Army soldier had done for her family by helping them out during World War I. Violette shows Linus a picture of the soldier, and he comments that the soldier looks like Charlie Brown and it is revealed that the soldier is actually Charlie Brown's grandfather, Silas Brown. The baron returns home and Violette attempts to hide Linus, but accidentally drops a candle, engulfing a fire in the chateau's attic. Charlie Brown runs to get Peppermint Patty and Marcie and Pierre calls the fire department while Snoopy and Woodstock get a old fashioned fire hose from a shed. Charlie Brown, Peppermint Patty, Marcie and Pierre rescue Linus and Violette and Snoopy uses the hose to keep the fire under control until the fire department arrives to help.\n\nThankful for the chateau's rescue, the baron has a change of heart and allows the gang inside, and Charlie Brown learns the truth behind the mysterious letter he received from Violette, and he, Snoopy, Linus, Patty, and Marcie leave their new friends to see more of the French countryside, and eventually return home to the United States.\n\n\nThe film had a mostly positive reception.\n\n\n"}

The island is the largest of a three-island group that also includes Little Captain and Wee Captain. The island is a remnant of a glacial moraine and has a large glacial erratic on the southern side, the island's east and west sides are connected by a tombolo. The island has had several owners, but has been owned in whole by the Town of Greenwich since 1973. The island is home to the Great Captain Island Light, a 19th-century lighthouse that was restored in 2009 and relit as a non-navigational aid in 2012. The actual navigation aid is a skeletal tower erected in 1970. Great Captain Island is one of the state's 26 \"important bird areas\" according to the Connecticut Audubon Society. The town operates a ferry service to and from the island from about the second week in June through the second week of September. Trails have been laid out for visitors, and the western part of the island has picnic tables, grills, restrooms, and posted swimming areas. The island is open year round, with a ferry running during the summer. No public tours of the lighthouse or island are available.\n\nThe island is the largest of a three-island group that also includes Little Captain and Wee Captain. The island is the southernmost point of land in not only Connecticut, but New England. The Town of Greenwich states that the Great Captain Island \"is a remnant of a glacial moraine. It contains a diversity of rock types- gneiss, schist, granite-with a very large glacial erratic on the southern side.\" The island's east and west sides are connected by a tombolo, and the southern side has a lagoon that winds its way around the lighthouse. It is near many harbors such as Port Chester Harbor\n\nThere are two theories for how the island got its name, the first of which is that the island is named after Captain Kidd who was rumored to have buried a treasure of gold and silver on it. The Town of Greenwich acknowledges both this and another theory that states that \"[t]he \"Captain\" of the title reportedly memorializes Captain Daniel Patrick, a partner in the first recorded real estate transaction in Greenwich in the 1640s and the town's first military commander.\"\n\nIn 1763, George III granted the island to John Anderson. In 1829, the federal government purchased 3.5 acres of land on the southeast part of Great Captain Island from Samuel Lyons. The states of New York and Connecticut both claimed the island in the 19th century but, after 50 years, a commission resolved the dispute in favor of Connecticut. The lighthouse keepers and their families farmed on the tract of land and the other areas of the island were used for hunting, fishing and recreational use. In 1926, the rest of the island was sold to a developer who built and opened an exclusive clubhouse on the site. Opening in 1930, at the beginning of the Great Depression, it soon was closed. The Town of Greenwich acquired the island through foreclosure and sold the property to Port-Green Corporation. During this time, the Coast Guard inadvertently destroyed the clubhouse by dropping flares on it while searching for a missing plane. A fire in 1955 would destroy the rest of the club. In 1955, Areotech Industries purchased the island and used it as an employee recreational spot and built cabana cottages on it in 1957. During its ownership with Areotech, it was re-named Huckleberry Island, until the Town of Greenwich purchased it in 1966 for $90,000. In 1973, the federal government turned over the remaining tract of land upon which the lighthouse rests.\n\nThe Great Captain Island Light was first constructed in 1829 on the 3.5 acre tract of land that Samuel Lyons sold to the government. The lighthouse was of poor construction and was replaced in 1868 with a new granite dwelling with attached lantern. The lighthouse is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1970 when a skeletal tower replaced it. The Town of Greenwich acquired the property in 1973 and had full-time caretakers on the site until the lighthouse became too dilapidated in 2003. A successful restoration effort was completed in 2009 and a non-navigational light was activated in 2012. In 1991, the Great Captain Island Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\nIn 2010, a September 11 memorial plaque was installed to \"honor the 23 people who lived in Greenwich, or had a connection to the town\", who died in the September 11 attacks\". A non-navigational 4-second flashing green light was installed in the lighthouse on February 13, 2012. The lighthouse is currently occupied by a family who act as caretakers of the property.\n\nGreat Captain Island is one of the state's 26 \"important bird areas\" that provide an essential habitat for one or more bird species, according to the Connecticut Audubon Society. Great blue herons have been on the island since the 1990s. Great egrets, snowy egrets, and black-crowned night herons also live on the island. The island was once known as the state's largest heron and egret rookery, but in the early 2000s their populations shrunk dramatically, with summer counts down from a total of 364 in 1998 to 98 in 2004. Patrick Comins, director of bird conservation for Audubon Connecticut, thinks that the bird populations have been hurt by human disturbances and possibly by competition from cormorants and a great horned owl that lives on the island and has fed on the birds. Comins also said that overall pollution in Long Island Sound waters might also have an effect.\n\nIn the uplands of the island, an area that used to be lawn has been replaced with oak, hickory, ash, cherry, tree of heaven and sassafras. By the lighthouse, several openings in the shrubbery have been made to provide a variety of habitats for wildlife and a barrier of shrubs has been planted on the cliffs east of the lighthouse.\n\nThe town operates a ferry service to and from the island from about the second week in June through the second week of September. Trails have been laid out for visitors, and the western part of the island has picnic tables, grills, restrooms, and posted swimming areas. The island is open year round, with a ferry running during the summer. No public tours of the lighthouse or island are available. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy damaged the area and washed away the walkway.\n\n"}

It was named after the former Kingdom of Kaffa. The etymology of Kaffa is thought to be from the Arabic \"qahwah\" meaning \"a drink from berries\". The English word coffee is derived from the same root.\n\nKaffa was bordered on the west by Sudan, on the northwest by Illubabor, on the north by Walega, on the northeast by Shewa, on the east by Sidamo, and on the southeast by Gamu-Gofa.\n\nFor the former province, see Keffa Province.\n\nKeffa is a Zone in the Ethiopian Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (SNNPR). Keffa is bordered on the south by Debub Omo, on the southwest by Bench Maji, on the west by Sheka, on the north by the Oromia Region, and on the east by Konta. Gojeb River runs along part of the northern border of this zone. The administrative center of Keffa is Bonga. Keffa formed the main part of former Keficho Shekicho Zone.\nDemographics\n\nBased on the 2017 Census conducted by the CSA, this Zone has a total population of 2,100,000, of whom 1,317,078 are men and 7,83,022women; 152,036 or 9.44% are urban inhabitants. The four largest ethnic groups reported in this Zone were the Kafficho (82.72%), the Bench (5.05%), the Amhara (3.67%), and the Oromo (3.5%); all other ethnic groups made up 5.09% of the population. Kafa is spoken as a first language by 82.49%, 4.18% speak Amharic, 5.13% Bench, and 3.43% speak Oromiffa; the remaining 4.77% spoke all other primary languages reported. 61.42% of the population said they practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, 24.84% were Protestants, 6.2% were Muslim, 5.37% practiced traditional beliefs, and 1.73% embraced Catholicism.[1]\n\nSouthern Ethiopia, including Sidamo, Kaffa, Arsi and Harar is the original home of coffee which grows wild here in the mountain rain forests in countless varieties. All plants of the species \"Coffea arabica\" around the world are descendants of plants from southern Ethiopia.\n\nCoffee has long been the main source of income, but due to the sharply declining world prices for coffee, the residents increasingly have to grow other crops. By turning rain forests into new agricultural land, the structure of the region is heavily damaged.\n\nThe rain forests that dominated the region of Kaffa earlier are reduced to only 3% of their original size, in the last 30 years 60% of the trees were lost.\n\nFor some years there is a large rain forest conservation project, which relies on the use of the last wild stocks of coffee growing in the rain forest. Currently, some 30 cooperatives are harvesting and marketing this specialty coffee and have helped over 40,000 people to get income.\n\nIn 2010, an area within the Kaffa province was recognised as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve as part of the Man and the Biosphere Programme. Officially named the \"Kafa Biosphere Reserve\" it is one of the first two biosphere reserves in Ethiopia and aims to protect the natural environment and foster sustainable development in the region. Lions were photographed in the reserve in 2012, the first documenting of that species in montane rainforest.\n"}

They were classified in .\n\nThese can be defined more generally as tessellations of the sphere, the Euclidean plane, or the hyperbolic plane. Each Schwarz triangle on a sphere defines a finite group, while on the Euclidean or hyperbolic plane they define an infinite group.\n\nA Schwarz triangle is represented by three rational numbers (\"p\" \"q\" \"r\") each representing the angle at a vertex. The value \"n/d\" means the vertex angle is \"d\"/\"n\" of the half-circle. \"2\" means a right triangle. When these are whole numbers, the triangle is called a Möbius triangle, and corresponds to a \"non\"-overlapping tiling, and the symmetry group is called a triangle group. In the sphere there are three Möbius triangles plus one one-parameter family; in the plane there are three Möbius triangles, while in hyperbolic space there is a three-parameter family of Möbius triangles, and no exceptional objects.\n\nA fundamental domain triangle (\"p\" \"q\" \"r\"), with vertex angles /\"p\", /\"q\", and /\"r\", can exist in different spaces depending on the value of the sum of the reciprocals of these integers:\n\nThis is simply a way of saying that in Euclidean space the interior angles of a triangle sum to , while on a sphere they sum to an angle greater than , and on hyperbolic space they sum to less.\n\nA Schwarz triangle is represented graphically by a triangular graph. Each node represents an edge (mirror) of the Schwarz triangle. Each edge is labeled by a rational value corresponding to the reflection order, being π/vertex angle.\n\nOrder-2 edges represent perpendicular mirrors that can be ignored in this diagram. The Coxeter-Dynkin diagram represents this triangular graph with order-2 edges hidden.\n\nA Coxeter group can be used for a simpler notation, as (\"p\" \"q\" \"r\") for cyclic graphs, and (\"p\" \"q\" 2) = [\"p\",\"q\"] for (right triangles), and (\"p\" 2 2) = [\"p\"]×[].\n\nSchwarz triangles with whole numbers, also called Möbius triangles, include one 1-parameter family and three exceptional cases:\n\n\nThe Schwarz triangles (\"p\" \"q\" \"r\"), grouped by density:\n\nDensity 1:\n\nDensity 2:\n\n\nDensity ∞:\n\n\nDensity 1:\n\n\nDensity 2:\n\n\nDensity 3:\n\n\nDensity 4:\n\n\nDensity 6:\n\n\nDensity 10:\n\n\nThe (2 3 7) Schwarz triangle is the smallest hyperbolic Schwarz triangle, and as such is of particular interest. Its triangle group (or more precisely the index 2 von Dyck group of orientation-preserving isometries) is the (2,3,7) triangle group, which is the universal group for all Hurwitz groups – maximal groups of isometries of Riemann surfaces. All Hurwitz groups are quotients of the (2,3,7) triangle group, and all Hurwitz surfaces are tiled by the (2,3,7) Schwarz triangle. The smallest Hurwitz group is the simple group of order 168, the second smallest non-abelian simple group, which is isomorphic to PSL(2,7), and the associated Hurwitz surface (of genus 3) is the Klein quartic.\n\nThe (2 3 8) triangle tiles the Bolza surface, a highly symmetric (but not Hurwitz) surface of genus 2.\n\nThe triangles with one noninteger angle, listed above, were first classified by Anthony W.

With eight seats, the VHP is currently the biggest opposition party in the Surinamese parliament.\n\nChan Santokhi is the chairman of the party since 3 July 2011, and under his leadership, the party has tried to move away from its past of representing only one of the country's ethnic groups. Previous chairman Ram Sardjoe holds the title of honorary chairman. \nAccording to current statistics, the Progressive Reform Party is the second biggest political party of Suriname (with Dési Bouterse's National Democratic Party being no. 1).\n\n\n\n"}

The plant is called lobeira (\"wolf's plant\") or fruta-do-lobo (\"wolf's fruit\") in Portuguese. \n\nThe name wolf apple comes from the fact that they account for up to 50% of the Maned wolf's diet. It's Latin name \"\"lycocarpum\"\" is derived from two words the first being \"\"lyco-\"\" meaning wolf and \"-\"carpum\"\" meaning crop or picked.\n\nWolf apples are a flowering shrub ranging in height from 1.2 to 3 m, with large, deeply lobed leaves covered in a soft grey-white fuzz. Their native range is the Brazilian savannah. It prefers moist, clay soil, full sun, and mild temperatures. Star-shaped blue or purple flowers appear from late fall to early spring, similar to the flowers of bitter nightshade. The large fruits (up to 13 cm in diameter) are golden yellow with variable red blushing when ripe. They resemble the tomato in external shape and internal morphology, but also the eggplant for the texture and color of the flesh, and in having a broad velvety cap.\n\nThe ripe fruits are edible to humans, and are consumed by local populations in jams and preserves, but the unripe fruits are quite rich in tannin. \"Solanum lycocarpum\" fruits can be used as a larvicide to ward off infections from organisms such as mosquitos. All other parts of the plant are poisonous. The fruits are used as a fallback source of food for cattle in the dry season.\n\nCurrently, there are no proven medicinal uses for the wolf apple, but the plant is used in the local folk medicine for obesity, cholesterol reduction, and as a treatment for diabetes in which can be an effective support. It contains about 1.5% of glycoalkaloids in its dried fruits; consisting mainly of solamargine and solasonine in which its alkaloidic extract shows promising schistosomicidal activity that can prevent any parasitism.It is believed that the fruits protect the Maned wolf from infection of the Giant kidney worm, which is usually fatal for the animal.\n\n"}
{"id": "2069341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069341", "title": "Natural World (TV series)", "text": "Natural World (TV series)\n\nNatural World is a strand of British wildlife documentary programmes broadcast on BBC Two and BBC Two HD and regarded by the BBC as its flagship natural history series. It is the longest-running documentary in its genre on British television, with nearly 500 episodes broadcast since its inception in 1983. \"Natural World\" programmes are typically one-off films that take an in-depth look at particular natural history events, stories or subjects from around the globe.\n\n\"Natural World\" is produced by the BBC Natural History Unit in Bristol under the stewardship of the Series Editor, who is responsible for commissioning or acquiring content. Programmes are a mixture of in-house productions, collaborative productions with other broadcasters or acquisitions from independent producers. There are 10 programmes broadcast each year, of which approximately half are produced in-house. The series has close ties with the US series \"Nature\", broadcast by PBS.\n\n\"Natural World\" was initiated in 1983 as a wildlife-specific spin-off to \"The World About Us\", itself a long-running documentary strand on BBC Two. \"The World About Us\" was commissioned in 1967 by David Attenborough, at that time the Controller of BBC Two, to promote the new colour television service to British audiences. As the former head of the BBC's Travel and Exploration Unit in London, Attenborough realised that many of its telecine films had been shot in colour and would make ideal subjects for a documentary series, along with natural history content from the Bristol Unit and overseas broadcasters. \"The World About Us\" launched on 3 December 1967 to coincide with the first full evening of colour television in Britain, with Attenborough himself acting as Series Editor. The first programme was \"Volcano\", a film by the French vulcanologist Haroun Tazieff; the Natural History Unit's first contribution was \"Forest and Firebird\" featuring the brilliantly-coloured scarlet ibis. Programmes such as these were no accident: \"The World About Us\" was described by Barry Paine, a frequent producer and narrator during its first two decades, as \"a series designed to sell colour television sets\".\n\nDue to the difficulty of sourcing colour films at the time, \"The World About Us\" started out with a broad remit of geography, anthropology and natural history as subject matter. Gradually, the contributions from the Travel and Exploration Unit diminished and the Natural History Unit's programmes grew in prominence. This was acknowledged by the BBC when the series was re-launched as \"The Natural World\" in 1983; the title subsequently shortened to its current form in 2003. The first episode under the new title was \"Save the Panda\", broadcast on 30 October 1983 in what would become a regular time slot on Sunday evenings (where Series Editor Peter Jones claimed audiences were \"hungry for natural history\"). \"The World About Us\" continued until 1986.\n\nThe early Series Editors benefited from a generous budget, courtesy of a co-production partnership with the US broadcaster WNET. The American channel was keen to commission material for its recently launched \"Nature\" strand on PBS. The first programme to benefit from the partnership was the 1982 mini-series \"The Flight of the Condor\". At the same time, researchers and field biologists were publishing many new discoveries about wildlife in scientific journals, providing the BBC with plentiful material for new programme ideas. As a result, the strand quickly expanded from 10 to 20 slots by 1985 and a number of special programmes were commissioned, helped by additional funding from BBC Enterprises (now BBC Worldwide). Among them were the award-winning mini-series \"Kingdom of the Ice Bear\" (1985) and \"Vanishing Earth\" (1986).\n\nDavid Attenborough has maintained a close association with \"Natural World\" throughout its long history, narrating or presenting around 50 episodes to date. In 2008, on the strand's 25th anniversary, he commented \"I have no doubt that Natural World is not only the doyen and founding member of the 50-minute natural history genre but is still the one with the best and most distinguished record.\"\n\nIn recent years, the number of \"Natural World\" programmes has reduced to 10 per series, and the strand no longer occupies a regular place in BBC Two's schedule. High-definition broadcasts of \"Natural World\" programmes started in 2008 on the BBC HD channel and following its closure are now simulcast on BBC Two HD.\n\n\"The World About Us\" helped to popularize the long-form documentary on British television thanks to its generous 50-minute length, a step up from the half-hour programmes which were more common at the time. Filmmakers were able to take advantage of this format to delve into a particular story in more detail, or cover broader themes. More recently, the running time has been extended to 60 minutes.\n\nThe tone of the strand was set by its first Series Editor, Peter Jones, who gave his film-makers the time and budget to explore their subjects in more detail. He also decided to avoid a house style in favour of a flexible approach where the style was chosen to match the subject of the documentary. This freedom from stylistic constraints gave film-makers autonomy to make the programmes they wanted. As \"Natural World\" quickly established itself in the schedules, the Series Editors were able to take risks with unusual subjects which may otherwise have been avoided by broadcasters. According to Jones, \"the idea was to give the audience a surprise each week. It was as far from the contemporary concept of formatted television as you could get.\" Some of the more unusual subjects have included plankton, wasps, cephalopods and manure (\"The Wonderful World of Dung\", 1991).\n\nJones's successors have maintained the same ethos, mixing traditional \"blue-chip\" natural history with different approaches to storytelling. Mike Gunton, Series Editor from 2001-2004, introduced more human elements into the programmes, granted filmmakers additional time in the field to get the shots they needed and continued to experiment with style. \"Cats Under Serengeti Stars\" was filmed entirely in black and white and \"Dune\" was told from the point of view of a grain of sand.\n\nIn its current guise, \"Natural World\" programmes typically fall into three categories: strong, emotional stories; popular or unusual but interesting animal subjects; and films offering a different, personal perspective. Filmmakers are granted up to 100 days in the field, depending on how much archive material can be used.\n\nDavid Attenborough's notable episodes include the \"Echo of the Elephants\" films, which followed scientist Cynthia Moss and cameraman Martyn Colbeck on their lengthy study of an elephant herd in Kenya. In \"Attenborough in Paradise\" (1996), he fulfilled a lifelong ambition to observe and film the courtship displays of birds of paradise, whilst \"The Amber Time Machine\" (2004) saw him trace the origins of a piece of amber from the time of the dinosaurs. For \"Attenborough's Ark\", a 2012 special, he selected his 10 personal favourite species to save on an imaginary ark. The programme drew 3.2 million viewers, the strand's highest audience for eight years. \"Natural World\"'s most-watched episode also featured Attenborough, this time as the narrator of \"Highgrove, A Prince's Legacy\" (2003). 4.8 million viewers watched Prince Charles explain the organic farming methods used on his Highgrove House estate.\n\nFor many years, the series regularly included documentaries on British wildlife, but the commissioning editors no longer consider such programmes. The last programme with a British theme was \"An Unnatural History of London\" in 2012, which featured the capital's urban wildlife. Another programme set in Britain, 2003's \"My Halcyon River\", became the most requested repeat by readers of \"Radio Times\" in the days following its transmission.\n\n\"Natural World\" programmes are regularly nominated at television industry awards and wildlife film festivals. Notable award-winners from the early years of the series include the 1986 Prix Italia for \"Vanishing Earth\" and an Emmy for cinematography for \"Kingdom of the Ice Bear\". The Royal Television Society awarded \"Natural World\" the Best Documentary Strand in 1999 and photography prizes to the episodes \"Mississippi, Tales of the Last River Rat\" in 2005 and \"Wye, Voices from the Valley\" in 2007. \"Mississippi, Tales of the Last River Rat\" was also recognised at the Grierson Trust's British Documentary Awards in 2005.\n\nRecent award-winning episodes include \"A Tiger Called Broken Tail\", overall winner at the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival in 2011 and Missoula's International Wildlife Film Festival (IWFF) in 2012, \"Madagascar, Lemurs and Spies\", a three-time winner at IWFF in 2012, \"My Life As A Turkey\", recipient of the Golden Panda at the Wildscreen Festival in 2012 and \"Kangaroo Dundee\", a prize-winner at Jackson Hole and IWFF in 2013.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2069342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069342", "title": "Triangle group", "text": "Triangle group\n\nIn mathematics, a triangle group is a group that can be realized geometrically by sequences of reflections across the sides of a triangle. The triangle can be an ordinary Euclidean triangle, a triangle on the sphere, or a hyperbolic triangle. Each triangle group is the symmetry group of a tiling of the Euclidean plane, the sphere, or the hyperbolic plane by congruent triangles called Möbius triangles, each one a fundamental domain for the action.\n\nLet \"l\", \"m\", \"n\" be integers greater than or equal to 2. A triangle group Δ(\"l\",\"m\",\"n\") is a group of motions of the Euclidean plane, the two-dimensional sphere, the real projective plane, or the hyperbolic plane generated by the reflections in the sides of a triangle with angles π/\"l\", π/\"m\" and π/\"n\" (measured in radians). The product of the reflections in two adjacent sides is a rotation by the angle which is twice the angle between those sides, 2π/\"l\", 2π/\"m\" and 2π/\"n\". Therefore, if the generating reflections are labeled \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" and the angles between them in the cyclic order are as given above, then the following relations hold:\n\n\nIt is a theorem that all other relations between \"a, b, c\" are consequences of these relations and that Δ(\"l,m,n\") is a discrete group of motions of the corresponding space. Thus a triangle group is a reflection group that admits a group presentation\n\nAn abstract group with this presentation is a Coxeter group with three generators.\n\nGiven any natural numbers \"l\", \"m\", \"n\" > 1 exactly one of the classical two-dimensional geometries (Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic) admits a triangle with the angles (π/l, π/m, π/n), and the space is tiled by reflections of the triangle. The sum of the angles of the triangle determines the type of the geometry by the Gauss–Bonnet theorem: it is Euclidean if the angle sum is exactly π, spherical if it exceeds π and hyperbolic if it is strictly smaller than π. Moreover, any two triangles with the given angles are congruent. Each triangle group determines a tiling, which is conventionally colored in two colors, so that any two adjacent tiles have opposite colors.\n\nIn terms of the numbers \"l\", \"m\", \"n\" > 1 there are the following possibilities.\n\nformula_4\n\nThe triangle group is the infinite symmetry group of a certain tessellation (or tiling) of the Euclidean plane by triangles whose angles add up to π (or 180°). Up to permutations, the triple (\"l\", \"m\", \"n\") is one of the triples (2,3,6), (2,4,4), (3,3,3). The corresponding triangle groups are instances of wallpaper groups.\n\nThe triangle group is the finite symmetry group of a tiling of a unit sphere by spherical triangles, or Möbius triangles, whose angles add up to a number greater than π. Up to permutations, the triple (\"l\",\"m\",\"n\") has the form (2,3,3), (2,3,4), (2,3,5), or (2,2,\"n\"), \"n\" > 1. Spherical triangle groups can be identified with the symmetry groups of regular polyhedra in the three-dimensional Euclidean space: Δ(2,3,3) corresponds to the tetrahedron, Δ(2,3,4) to both the cube and the octahedron (which have the same symmetry group), Δ(2,3,5) to both the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. The groups Δ(2,2,\"n\"), \"n\" > 1 of dihedral symmetry can be interpreted as the symmetry groups of the family of dihedra, which are degenerate solids formed by two identical regular \"n\"-gons joined together, or dually hosohedra, which are formed by joining \"n\" digons together at two vertices.\n\nThe spherical tiling corresponding to a regular polyhedron is obtained by forming the barycentric subdivision of the polyhedron and projecting the resulting points and lines onto the circumscribed sphere. In the case of the tetrahedron, there are four faces and each face is an equilateral triangle that is subdivided into 6 smaller pieces by the medians intersecting in the center. The resulting tesselation has 4 × 6=24 spherical triangles (it is the spherical disdyakis cube).\n\nThese groups are finite, which corresponds to the compactness of the sphere – areas of discs in the sphere initially grow in terms of radius, but eventually cover the entire sphere.\n\nThe triangular tilings are depicted below:\nSpherical tilings corresponding to the octahedron and the icosahedron and dihedral spherical tilings with even \"n\" are centrally symmetric. Hence each of them determines a tiling of the real projective plane, an elliptic tiling. Its symmetry group is the quotient of the spherical triangle group by the reflection through the origin (-\"I\"), which is a central element of order 2. Since the projective plane is a model of elliptic geometry, such groups are called \"elliptic\" triangle groups.\n\nThe triangle group is the infinite symmetry group of a tiling of the hyperbolic plane by hyperbolic triangles whose angles add up to a number less than π. All triples not already listed represent tilings of the hyperbolic plane. For example, the triple (2,3,7) produces the (2,3,7) triangle group. There are infinitely many such groups; the tilings associated with some small values:\n\nHyperbolic triangle groups are examples of non-Euclidean crystallographic group and have been generalized in the theory of Gromov hyperbolic groups.\n\nDenote by \"D\"(\"l\",\"m\",\"n\") the subgroup of index 2 in \"Δ(l,m,n)\" generated by words of even length in the generators. Such subgroups are sometimes referred to as \"ordinary\" triangle groups or von Dyck groups, after Walther von Dyck. For spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic triangles, these correspond to the elements of the group that preserve the orientation of the triangle – the group of rotations. For projective (elliptic) triangles, they cannot be so interpreted, as the projective plane is non-orientable, so there is no notion of \"orientation-preserving\". The reflections are however \"locally\" orientation-reversing (and every manifold is locally orientable, because locally Euclidean): they fix a line and at each point in the line are a reflection across the line.\n\nThe group \"D\"(\"l\",\"m\",\"n\") is defined by the following presentation:\nIn terms of the generators above, these are \"x = ab, y = ca, yx = cb\". Geometrically, the three elements \"x\", \"y\", \"xy\" correspond to rotations by 2π/\"l\", 2π/\"m\" and 2π/\"n\" about the three vertices of the triangle.\n\nNote that \"D\"(\"l\",\"m\",\"n\") ≅ \"D\"(\"m\",\"l\",\"n\") ≅ \"D\"(\"n\",\"m\",\"l\"), so \"D\"(\"l\",\"m\",\"n\") is independent of the order of the \"l\",\"m\",\"n\".\n\nA hyperbolic von Dyck group is a Fuchsian group, a discrete group consisting of orientation-preserving isometries of the hyperbolic plane.\n\nTriangle groups preserve a tiling by triangles, namely a fundamental domain for the action (the triangle defined by the lines of reflection), called a Möbius triangle, and are given by a triple of \"integers,\" (\"l\",\"m\",\"n\"), – integers correspond to (2\"l\",2\"m\",2\"n\") triangles coming together at a vertex. There are also tilings by overlapping triangles, which correspond to Schwarz triangles with \"rational\" numbers (\"l\"/\"a\",\"m\"/\"b\",\"n\"/\"c\"), where the denominators are coprime to the numerators. This corresponds to edges meeting at angles of \"a\"π/\"l\" (resp.), which corresponds to a rotation of 2\"a\"π/\"l\" (resp.), which has order \"l\" and is thus identical as an abstract group element, but distinct when represented by a reflection.\n\nFor example, the Schwarz triangle (2 3 3) yields a density 1 tiling of the sphere, while the triangle (2 3/2 3) yields a density 3 tiling of the sphere, but with the same abstract group. These symmetries of overlapping tilings are not considered triangle groups.\n\nTriangle groups date at least to the presentation of the icosahedral group as the (rotational) (2,3,5) triangle group by William Rowan Hamilton in 1856, in his paper on icosian calculus.\n\nTriangle groups arise in arithmetic geometry. The modular group is generated by two elements, \"S\" and \"T\", subject to the relations \"S\"² = (\"ST\")³ = 1 (no relation on \"T\"), is the rotational triangle group (2,3,∞) and maps onto all triangle groups (2,3,\"n\") by adding the relation \"T\" = 1. More generally, the Hecke group \"H\" is generated by two elements, \"S\" and \"T\", subject to the relations \"S\" = (\"ST\") = 1 (no relation on \"T\"), is the rotational triangle group (2,\"q\",∞), and maps onto all triangle groups (2,\"q\",\"n\") by adding the relation \"T\" = 1 the modular group is the Hecke group \"H\". In Grothendieck's theory of dessins d'enfants, a Belyi function gives rise to a tessellation of a Riemann surface by reflection domains of a triangle group.\n\nAll 26 sporadic groups are quotients of triangle groups, of which 12 are Hurwitz groups (quotients of the (2,3,7) group).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2069358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069358", "title": "Virgin Islands Creole", "text": "Virgin Islands Creole\n\nVirgin Islands Creole, or Virgin Islands Creole English, is an English-based creole consisting of several varieties spoken in the Virgin Islands and the nearby SSS islands of Saba, Saint Martin and Sint Eustatius, where it is known as Saban English, Saint Martin English, and Statian English, respectively.\n\nThe term \"Virgin Islands Creole\" is formal terminology used by scholars and academics, and is rarely used in everyday speech. Informally, the creole is known by the term \"dialect\", as the creole is often perceived by locals as a dialect variety of English instead of an English creole language. However, academic sociohistorical and linguistic research suggests that it is in fact an English creole language.\n\nBecause there are several varieties of Virgin Islands Creole, it is also colloquially known by the specific island on which it is spoken: \"Crucian dialect, Thomian dialect, Tortolian dialect, Saint Martin dialect, Saba dialect, Statia dialect\".\n\nThe creole was formed when enslaved Africans, unable to communicate with each other and their European owners due to being taken from different regions of West Africa with different languages, created an English-based pidgin with West African-derived words and grammatical structure. This was creolized as it was passed on to subsequent generations as their native tongue.\n\nSt. Thomas and St. John, although Danish colonies, had a European population of mainly Dutch origin, which led to enslaved Africans first creating a Dutch-based creole, known as \"Negerhollands\" (now considered a dead language, although there may be a few who recall some of the vocabulary and may have passed it down to the next generation). Negerhollands was in mainstream usage on St. Thomas and St. John up until the 19th century, when the British occupied the Danish West Indies from 1801 to 1802 and 1807 to 1815. In addition, as English became preferred as a trade and business language in the busy port of Charlotte Amalie, Virgin Islands Creole became established in preference to Negerhollands. Some of the population continued to use Negerhollands well into the 20th century.\n\nUnlike the continental European population of the other Danish West Indian islands, that of St. Croix was mostly of English, Irish and Scottish origin, which led to African slaves developing an English-based creole throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. By the 19th century, Virgin Islands Creole was spoken on St. Thomas and St. John, as Negerhollands was fading away. By the end of the 19th century, English creole completely replaced Negerhollands as the native dialect of St. Thomas and St. John.\n\nThe creole had also been developing in the present-day British Virgin Islands. The British took over the islands from the Dutch in 1672. Enslaved Africans were brought to work on plantations on the islands of Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada and Jost Van Dyke where they, like those enslaved on St. Croix over 40 miles away, developed an English-based creole. Although the U.S. and British Virgin Islands are politically separate, they share a common Virgin Islands culture, similar history based on colonialism and slavery, and some common bloodlines.\n\nLike those in the Virgin Islands, African slaves were brought to the SSS islands of Saba, Sint Eustatius and Saint Martin. The prevalence of Europeans from the British Isles on these islands, as well as the SSS islands' proximity and trade with nearby English-speaking islands, resulted in an English creole being spoken in the SSS islands. Due to the heavy importation of workers from Saint Martin after the 1848 emancipation in the Danish West Indies, as well as a tendency for wealthy planters to own plantations in both the Virgin Islands and SSS islands, the \"ancestral\" inhabitants (descendants of the original African slaves and European colonists) of the SSS islands share common bloodlines and a common culture with those of the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.\n\nToday the creole is native to the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and the nearby \"SSS islands\" of Saba, Saint Martin (both French and Dutch sides) and Sint Eustatius. Though not called by the same name, the Virgin Islands and SSS varieties are considered by linguists to be the same creole.\n\nThere are slight variations from island to island. The speech of St. Croix (known as \"Crucian\") is the most distinct, sharing many similarities with the English creoles of Belize and Panama. This is perhaps due to migration from St. Croix to Panama during the building of the Panama Canal. The speech of the SSS islands is slightly closer to that of the British Virgin Islands than the speech of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The speech of St. Thomas and St. John shares distinct similarities with both the Crucian and British Virgin Islands variants.\n\nVirgin Islands Creole does not have the status of an official language. The language of government, education and the media is American English in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Queen's English in the British Virgin Islands, both Dutch and English on Saba, Sint Eustatius and the Dutch side of Saint Martin, and French on the French side of Saint Martin.\n\nLike most Anglophone Caribbean islands, a post-creole speech continuum exists, in which there are two extremes — standard English (known as the \"acrolect\") and the creole in its most distinct, or \"raw\", form (known as the \"basilect\").\n\nDue to the constant contact between standard English and Virgin Islands Creole in local society, there are many in-between speech varieties as well (known as \"mesolects\"). Most native Virgin Islanders can easily maneuver this continuum depending on their mood, subject matter, or addressee.\n\nIn recent decades, the basilect form of the creole is typically only spoken among older islanders. Although the basilect is no longer in common use among the younger population, it has still been preserved by way of historical plays, folk songs and local literature. The variety spoken by middle-aged and younger Virgin Islanders today is of a mesolectal form that still retains numerous creole features, yet is slightly closer to standard English than the basilect spoken by older islanders.\n\nVirgin Islands Creole has different forms that vary by the age of the speaker, as many words and expressions are known only by older islanders, while there are also relatively newer words and expressions known only to younger islanders. The creole continues to undergo changes in a \"post-creole\" environment. Its most modern mesolectal form is mainly derived from traditional Virgin Islands Creole terms, idioms, proverbs and sentence structure, with influences from African-American and Jamaican idioms, due to the prevalence of African-American and Jamaican mainstream pop culture in the Leeward Islands region. The variant of Virgin Islands Creole spoken on St. Croix, known as \"Crucian\", contains many Spanish-derived words due to St. Croix's large ethnic Puerto Rican population. Many Crucians of Puerto Rican descent speak a Spanglish-like code switching of Puerto Rican Spanish and the local Crucian dialect. In addition, due to long-standing historical and family ties between St. Croix and the nearby Puerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra, many Vieques and Culebra locals of Crucian descent also speak Crucian dialect. As the English creole is spoken in Dutch St. Martin, and Spanish is the second most dominant language there next to English and creole, Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics also speak Spanglish-like code switching of Puerto Rican and other Spanish dialects and local dialect of the island along w/ Dutch and standard English. The same situation happens in Saba and St. Eustatius, and in British Virgin Islands, they speak Spanglish-like code switching of Spanish and creole with British English.\n\nAs in other Caribbean creoles, proverbs are prevalent in Virgin Islands Creole. However, in 2004, a linguistic study group in cooperation with the University of Puerto Rico’s Rio Piedras campus found that many old proverbs in the Crucian dialect, common among older generations, have faded away and are not generally known among many young Crucians. Many Virgin Islanders who migrate to the United States often return with American-influenced speech patterns (colloquially known as \"yankin\"') that influence local speech of their peer groups. These changes, as well as the perception held by many older Virgin Islanders that the dialect is currently undergoing decreolization, have inspired debates on whether the dialect spoken by young Virgin Islanders today is in fact the true Virgin Islands Creole.\n\nLike most Caribbean creoles, the use of Virgin Islands Creole can vary depending on socioeconomic class. The middle and upper classes tend to speak it informally among friends and at home, but code switch to Standard English in the professional sphere. The lower socioeconomic classes tend to use the dialect in almost every aspect of daily life.\n\nIn the U.S. Virgin Islands, there has been an underlying negative pressure on Virgin Islanders to eliminate their dialect due to Americanization since the 1960s. Although the United States acquired the islands from Denmark in 1917, American influence did not arrive until the early 1960s. Standard American English is associated with social mobility, as it is widely used in business and professional circles. Virgin Islands Creole, although appreciated for its cultural value and widely used informally, is often seen as an impediment to economic and educational progress.\n\nThe majority of Virgin Islanders speak Virgin Islands Creole. However, due to immigration from the rest of the Caribbean and the United States, some Virgin Islands residents do not speak it. Most non-native longtime residents can understand spoken Virgin Islands Creole, even if not fluent in speaking themselves. In local vernacular, Virgin Islands Creole is rarely referred to as a creole, as locally, \"creole\" (as well as \"patois\") usually refers to the French-based creoles spoken by St. Lucian, Dominican (Dominica) and Haitian immigrants. Instead, Virgin Islanders tend to refer to the dialect by their native island (i.e. \"Crucian dialect\", \"Thomian dialect\", \"Tolian dialect\", etc.)\n\nAs with other Caribbean creoles, Virgin Islands Creole is generally unwritten. However, local authors often write in the creole in the field of colloquial literature, and young Virgin Islanders tend to write in it when communicating over the Internet. Because no standard spelling system exists in Virgin Islands Creole, those who attempt to write it use English orthography.\n\nThe prevailing sentiment is that Virgin Islands Creole cannot be learned like a standard language, but acquired only through having spent one's formative years in the Virgin Islands. Attempts by Virgin Islands non-native residents to speak the dialect, even out of respect, are often met with disapproval. A notable exception applies to immigrants who cannot speak English upon arrival. For example, persons from the Dominican Republic and Haiti, lacking fluency in English upon arrival, often learn Virgin Islands Creole before they are able to master standard English. In nearby French St. Martin, there are persons from France and the French West Indies who, lacking fluency in English upon arrival in St. Martin, learn the local variety of Saint Martin English spoken by the native population.\n\nAs with other Caribbean creoles, Virgin Islands Creole has a smaller set of pronouns than English, and conjugations occur less often. For example, the English phrase \"I gave it to her\" would translate to \"Ah gi'e it toh she\" in Virgin Islands Creole. Another common pattern found in Virgin Islands Creole is the absence of the letter \"s\" in the plural, possessive and third person present tense. For example, \"my eyes\" would translate to \"ma eye dem.\"\n\nThe pronunciation differs from Standard English in various ways. Virgin Islands and \"SSS islands\" accents are somewhat similar to those of other Caribbean countries, especially Guyana, the Cayman Islands, Belize and Panama, but are also unique in many ways.\n\nAs in most Anglophone Caribbean dialects, in Virgin Islands Creole, dental fricatives (the \"-th\" sound) are often omitted from speech, and replaced by dental stops (the \"-t\" sound). The vowel pronunciation of Virgin Islands Creole can widely differ from Standard English. For example, in Virgin Islands Creole (as well as most other Anglophone Caribbean creoles), the suffix \"er\" in English, in Standard English, is pronounced (for example: \"computer\" is pronounced (\"computah\"), and \"never\" is pronounced (\"nevah\")). Not all words ending in \"er\" however, are pronounced in this way.\n\nLike many other Caribbean islands, the \"oi\" sound in Standard English is replaced with long I (). For example, the English word \"join\" would be pronounced \"jine\". Such anomalies have their roots in 17th and 18th century England, where such vowel sounds were pronounced similarly.\n\nVirgin Islands Creole also displays similarities to the English-based pidgin and creole languages of West Africa, due to their common descent from the blending of African substrate languages with English as the superstrate language.\n\nLocal speech varies among each of the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. It is commonplace for such differences to be pointed out in jest when Virgin Islanders of different islands congregate. For example, the pronunciation of the standard English phrase \"come here\" would be \"come ya\" on St. Croix and \"come heh\" on St. Thomas, St. John and the British Virgin Islands. On the neighboring island of Saint Martin, it is pronounced \"come hyuh\". In addition, the Virgin Islands Creole form of the word \"car\" is \"cyar\" on St. Croix and \"cah\" on St. Thomas, St. John and the British Virgin Islands. These two anomalies are due to Irish influence on St. Croix during the Danish colonial period.\n\nVowel sounds can also widely differ between islands. For example, the word \"special\" is usually pronounced \"speshahl\" on St. Croix and \"speshuhl\" on St. Thomas, St. John, the British Virgin Islands, and St. Martin. \"Island\" is usually pronounced \"islahn' \" on St. Croix and \"isluhn\"' on St. Thomas, St. John, the British Virgin Islands, and St. Martin.\n\nAnother commonly cited example of linguistic differences between the islands is the usage of the term \"deh\", the Virgin Islands Creole form of the standard English adverb \"there\". On St. Croix, an additional \"deh\" is often added, forming the phrase \"deh-deh\". Such usage is found in many Caribbean islands outside the Virgin Islands, as well. There are many instances where words and phrases (especially slang) that exist on one island may not exist on another. In addition, the Virgin Islands Creole spoken on St. Croix is often described as being more \"raw\", or distant from standard English, than those of the other Virgin Islands.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2069374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069374", "title": "Pella curse tablet", "text": "Pella curse tablet\n\nThe Pella curse tablet is a text written in a distinct Doric Greek idiom, found in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedon, in 1986. Ιt contains a curse or magic spell (, \"katadesmos\") inscribed on a lead scroll, dated to the first half of the 4th century BC (circa 375–350 BC). It was published in the \"Hellenic Dialectology\" Journal in 1993. It is one of four known texts that may represent a local dialectal form of ancient Greek in Macedonia, all of them identifiable as Doric. These suggest that a Doric Greek dialect was spoken in Macedonia, as was previously proposed based on the West Greek forms of names found in Macedonia. As a result, the Pella curse tablet has been forwarded as an argument that the Ancient Macedonian language was a dialect of North-Western Greek, and one of the Doric dialects.\n\nThe spell was written by a woman, possibly named \"Dagina\", and was intended to cause her former lover to marry her.\n\nThe tablet is also described as a \"mixed curse\" due to the supplicative nature of the appeal. For example, the word ΕΡΗΜΑ or \"abandoned\" is quite common in appeals to divine powers.\n\nIt is a magic spell or love charm written by a woman, possibly named \"Dagina\" (Ancient Greek: Δαγίνα), whose lover \"Dionysophōn\" (Διονυσοφῶν, gen.: Διονυσοφῶντος) is apparently about to marry \"Thetima\" (Θετίμα, \"she who honors the gods\"; the Attic Greek form is \"Theotimē\" - Θεοτίμη). She invokes \"Makron and the demons\" (\"parkattithemai makrōni kai [tois] daimosi\" - παρκαττίθεμαι μάκρωνι καὶ [τοῖς] δαίμοσι; in Attic, παρκαττίθεμαι is \"parakatatithemai\" - παρακατατίθεμαι) to cause Dionysophon to marry her instead of Thetima. Dagina also wants him never to marry another woman, unless she herself recovers and unrolls the scroll. She wishes for herself to grow old by the side of Dionysophon.\n\n\"Katadesmoi\" or \"defixiones\" were spells written on non-perishable material, such as lead, stone or baked clay, and were secretly buried to ensure their physical integrity, which would then guarantee the permanence of their intended effects. The language is a distinct form of North-West Greek, and the low social status of its writer, as (arguably) evidenced by her vocabulary and belief in magic, strongly suggests that a unique form of West Greek was spoken by lower-class people in Pella at the time the tablet was written. This should not, however, be taken to indicate that only those of middling or low social status practiced magic in the Ancient Greek world; quite wealthy individuals might also use lead katadesmoi (curse tablets) for love, revenge, and to bind their opponents in athletic contests.\n\n\nAccording to D. R. Jordan (Duke University), the tablet has been dated to the \"Mid-IV [century] or slightly earlier\".\n\nThe discovery of the Pella curse tablet, according to Olivier Masson, substantiates the view that the ancient Macedonian language was a form of North-West Greek:\n\"Yet in contrast with earlier views which made of it {i.e. Macedonian} an Aeolic dialect (O. Hoffmann compared Thessalian) we must by now think of a link with North-West Greek (Locrian, Aetolian, Phocidian, Epirote). This view is supported by the recent discovery at Pella of a curse tablet (4th cent. BC), which may well be the first 'Macedonian' text attested (provisional publication by E. Voutyras; cf. the Bulletin Epigraphique in Rev. Et. Grec. 1994, no. 413); the text includes an adverb \"opoka\" which is not Thessalian.\"\nOf the same opinion is James L. O'Neil's (University of Sydney) presentation at the 2005 Conference of the Australasian Society for Classical Studies, entitled \"Doric Forms in Macedonian Inscriptions\" (abstract):\n\"A fourth‐century BC curse tablet from Pella shows word forms which are clearly Doric, but a different form of Doric from any of the west Greek dialects of areas adjoining Macedon. Three other, very brief, fourth century inscriptions are also indubitably Doric. These show that a Doric dialect was spoken in Macedon, as we would expect from the West Greek forms of Greek names found in Macedon. And yet later Macedonian inscriptions are in Koine avoiding both Doric forms and the Macedonian voicing of consonants. The native Macedonian dialect had become unsuitable for written documents.\"\nProfessor Johannes Engels of the University of Cologne argues that the Pella curse tablet provides evidence to support that Macedonian was a North-West Greek dialect:\n\n\"Another very important testimony comes from the so-called Pella curse tablet. This is a text written in Doric Greek and found in 1986 [...] This has been judged to be the most important ancient testimony to substantiate that Macedonian was a north-western Greek and mainly a Doric dialect.\"\n\n\n"}

This law was named after Eusébio de Queirós Coutinho Matoso da Câmara, who was the Brazilian Minister of Justice from 1848–1852. This law was put into action by the government acting under Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro II. This law reinforced a law that was put into place on November 7, 1831, but had never been fully enforced and it also was based on an 1837 anti-slave trade bill of Felisberto Caldeira Brant, which had not been enacted into a law. This bill was modified and reintroduced into the Chamber of deputies and eventually passed. Even though the slave trade was officially abolished in 1850, slavery itself was not abolished in Brazil until 1888. Which made Brazil the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery.\n\nThe government was, however, against the British pressures applied to end such trade, such as the seizure of slave ships by British war ships. In 1845, the British parliament enacted the Aberdeen Act, which allowed British Cruisers to seize Brazilian slave ships in attempts to end their slave trade. This caused Brazilians to import as many slaves as possible in case the British succeeded in abolishing their slave trade, which is why the vast majority of slaves arrived in Brazil during 1847–1849.\n\nSlavery in Brazil was extremely prevalent and slave ships carried between 3.6 and 5 million slaves into Brazil over roughly three centuries (1525-1851). Rio de Janeiro alone had the largest slave population where 38.3% of their population consisted of slaves, or 80,000 slaves.\n"}

{"id": "2069449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069449", "title": "Chute Boxe Academy", "text": "Chute Boxe Academy\n\nThe Chute Boxe Academy (, \"Kick-Boxing\") opened as a Muay Thai academy in 1978 in Curitiba, Brazil. Head trainer Rudimar Fedrigo later expanded the program in 1991 to include Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and other aspects of modern mixed martial arts. By 1995, the Chute Boxe team was considered a prime training ground for Vale Tudo fighters. In 2004, an American branch, Chute Boxe USA, was established in Los Angeles, California.\n\nChute Boxe fighters are characterized by being extremely aggressive and physical, as well as well-rounded fighters, able to use submissions, punches, kicks, and various grappling styles as needed.\n\nThe Chute Boxe team first made a name for themselves in the MMA world during the late 1990s in the Brazilian vale tudo promotion known as the IVC. With an aggressive and physical style focused around their muay thai skills, Chute Boxe fighters captured three of the four title belts in the promotion (Wanderlei Silva winning the light heavyweight belt, José Landi-Jons winning the middleweight belt, and Rafael Cordeiro winning the lightweight belt). The promotion ended up serving as a spring board for the Chute Boxe team (as well as many other Brazilian MMA stars) into the lucrative Japanese MMA market. For Chute Boxe specifically, it would help to launch their careers in Japan's PRIDE FC.\n\nThe major cog of the Chute Boxe machine in PRIDE was Wanderlei Silva. Known for an exciting, brawling style complete with lethal knees and leaping stomps, he would exemplify Chute Boxe style martial arts in PRIDE's middleweight division and eventually win the 2003 PRIDE FC Middleweight Grand Prix and the PRIDE FC middleweight title which he would hold for 5 1/2 years.\n\nComing off of a disappointing five-round decision loss to Tito Ortiz at UFC 25: Ultimate Japan, Silva would return to PRIDE to earn the biggest victory of his career to that point over the Lion's Den's Guy Mezger. It would be 20 fights and over four years before he would lose again in a controversial decision to superheavyweight Mark Hunt. During this span he defeated notable fighters Kazushi Sakuraba (three times), Quinton “Rampage” Jackson (twice), Yuki Kondo, Ikuhisa Minowa, Hidehiko Yoshida, Kiyoshi Tamura, Dan Henderson, Alexander Otsuka, Shungo Oyama, Hiromitsu Kanehara, and would draw with Mirko \"Cro Cop\" Filipović.\n\nHis aura of invincibility wouldn't truly be broken until a decision loss to Ricardo Arona in the 2005 PRIDE FC middle weight Grand Prix. His loss would be avenged later that night by teammate and rising star, Mauricio “Shogun” Rua.\n\nAs the older of the Rua brothers, Murilo “Ninja” Rua had a mediocre run during his years with PRIDE FC. Wins over Mario Sperry, Akira Shoji and Alexander Otsuka established him as a contender in the organization. His younger brother Mauricio \"Shogun\" Rua would also enter the PRIDE fighting championships and would prove the most successful fighter produced by Chute Boxe under Wanderlei Silva's and Ninja's guidance.\n\nYounger than Murilo by about a year and a half, “Shogun” has defeated a who's who list of fighters including Evangelista “Cyborg” Santos, Akira Shoji, Akihiro Gono, Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson, Alistair Overeem (twice), Antonio Rogerio “Minotouro” Nogueira, Ricardo Arona, Kevin Randleman, Mark Coleman, Chuck Liddell, and Lyoto Machida. Shogun was the UFC light heavyweight champion until losing his first title defense against Jon Jones at UFC 128. His exciting, fan-friendly style includes much of the standard Chute Boxe Muay Thai clinch work, knees, stomps, and soccer kicks, as well as polished Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.\n\nThe opposite number in terms of Brazilian dominance in PRIDE FC was the Brazilian Top Team which was comprised, at the time, of such fighters as Antonio Rodrigo “Minotauro” Nogueira, Ricardo Arona, and Murilo Bustamante. Competition between the two teams was hardly limited to the Pride scene however. Matches between fighters of the two organizations had taken place in Brazil, Portugal and other parts of the world before, but perhaps the most interesting chapter of the rivalry took place on August 28, 2005 at the 2005 PRIDE FC middle weight Grand Prix.\n\nThe 2005 PRIDE FC middleweight Grand Prix would be the first such competition for newcomers Mauricio Rua and BTT's Ricardo Arona. Both scored impressive victories over highly regarded veterans Alistair Overeem and middleweight champ Wanderlei Silva respectively. It was Arona's victory over the latter that would stoke the flames of the rivalry because until then Silva had been the torch-bearer for Chute Boxe. Later that night, however, “Shogun” would pick up the torch with a thoroughly dominating first-round KO of Arona, ultimately finishing him on the ground which was considered Arona's strength.\n\nAnother notable aspect of this period is that it shortly followed the departure of promising prospect Anderson Silva. Silva had noted several disputes with Chute Boxe's management as reasons for leaving the team and shortly began training with some of Brazilian Top Team's best in the Nogueira brothers. He was quoted in an ESPN article as stating that friendships formed with his former rivals helped to save his career upon his departure from Chute Boxe.\nWith the demise of PRIDE FC in late 2007, coinciding with the departure of its first mass-appeal superstar Wanderlei Silva around the same time, Chute Boxe entered a new era. Moreover, the Rua brothers, Mauricio and Murilo, and Andre \"Dida\" Amade, also departed Chute Boxe to start their own gym. \nHowever, up and coming fighters, such as lightweight Jean Silva, have augmented their talent. In addition, fighter Evangelista Santos has recently competed in Strikeforce as well as his ex-wife, female fighter Cristiane \"Cyborg\" Santos, who is currently Chute Boxe's most marketable fighter.\n\n\n"}

He is president of the Molefi Kete Asante Institute for Afrocentric Studies.\n\nAsante is known for his writings on Afrocentricity, a school of thought that has influenced the fields of sociology, intercultural communication, critical theory, political science, the history of Africa, and social work. He is the author of more than 66 books and the founding editor of the \"Journal of Black Studies\". He is the father of author and filmmaker M. K. Asante.\n\nAsante was born Arthur Lee Smith Jr. in Valdosta, Georgia, the fourth of sixteen children. His father, Arthur Lee Smith, worked in a peanut warehouse and then on the Georgia Southern Railroad; his mother worked as a domestic. During the summers Asante would return to Georgia to work in the tobacco and cotton fields in order to earn tuition for school. An aunt, Georgia Smith, influenced him to pursue his education; she gave him his first book, a collection of short stories by Charles Dickens.\n\nSmith attended Nashville Christian Institute, a Church of Christ-founded boarding school for black students, in Nashville, Tennessee. There he earned his high school diploma in 1960. While still in high school, he became involved with the Civil Rights Movement, joining the Fisk University student march in Nashville.\n\nAfter graduation, he initially enrolled in Southwestern Christian College of Terrell, Texas, another historically black institution with Church of Christ roots. There he met Nigerian Essien Essien, whose character and intelligence inspired Smith to learn more about Africa.\n\nSmith received his B.A. from Oklahoma Christian College (now Oklahoma Christian University) in 1964. He did graduate work, earning his M.A. from Pepperdine University in 1965 with a thesis on Marshall Keeble, a black Church of Christ preacher. Smith earned his PhD from UCLA in 1968 in communication studies. He worked for a time at UCLA, becoming the director of the Center for Afro-American Studies. At the age of 30, he was appointed by the University at Buffalo as a full professor and head of the Department of Communication.\n\nIn 1976, Asante chose to make a legal name change because he considered \"Arthur Lee Smith\" a slave name.\nAt the University at Buffalo, Asante advanced the ideas of international and intercultural communication; he wrote and published with colleagues, \"Handbook of Intercultural Communication,\" the first book in the field. Asante was elected president of the Society for Intercultural Education, Training and Research in 1976. His work in intercultural communication made him a leading trainer of doctoral students in the field. Asante has directed more than one hundred PhD dissertations.\n\nAsante published his first study of the black movement, \"Rhetoric of Black Revolution,\" in 1969. Subsequently, he wrote \"Transracial Communication,\" to explain how race complicates human interaction in American society. Soon Asante changed his focus to African-American and African culture in communication, with attention to the nature of African-American oratorical style.\n\nAsante wrote \"Afrocentricity: The Theory of Social Change\" (1980) to announce a break with the past, where African-Americans believed they were on the margins of Europe and did not have a sense of historical centrality. He wrote on the conflict between white cultural hegemony and the oppressed African culture, and on the lack of victorious consciousness among Africans, a theme found in his principal philosophical work, \"The Afrocentric Idea\" (1987). Additional works on Afrocentric theory included \"Kemet, Afrocentricity and Knowledge\" (1990), and \"An Afrocentric Manifesto\" (2007).\n\nThe \"Utne Reader\" identified Asante as one of the 100 leading thinkers in America, writing, \"Asante is a genial, determined, and energetic cultural liberationist whose many books, including \"Afrocentricity\" and \"The Afrocentric Idea,\" articulate a powerful African-oriented pathway of thought, action, and cultural self-confidence for black Americans.\"\n\nIn 1986 Asante proposed the first doctoral program in African-American studies to the administration at Temple University. This program was approved, and the first class entered the doctorate in 1988. More than 500 applicants had sought admission to the graduate program. Temple became known as the leader among the African-American Studies departments; it was 10 years before the next doctoral program was introduced in this field, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1997. Alumni from the Temple program are found in every continent, many nations, and many direct African American Studies programs at major universities.\n\n\nAccording to \"The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Historical Writing Since 1945,\" Asante has \"based his entire career on Afrocentricity, and continues to defend it in spite of strong criticisms\".\n\nIn 1980 Asante published \"Afrocentricity: The Theory of Social Change\", which initiated a discourse around the issue of African agency and subject place in historical and cultural phenomena. He maintained that Africans had been moved off-center in terms on most questions of identity, culture, and history. Afrocentricity sought to place Africans at the center of their own narratives and to reclaim the teaching of African-American history from where it had been marginalized by Europeans.\n\nAsante's book \"The Afrocentric Idea\" was a more intellectual book about Afrocentricity than the earlier popular book. After the second edition of \"The Afrocentric Idea\" was released in 1998, Asante appeared as a guest on a number of television programs, including \"The Today Show\", \"60 Minutes\", and the \"MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour\", to discuss his ideas.\n\nAccording to Asante's \"Afrocentric Manifesto\", an Afrocentric project requires a minimum of five characteristics: (1) an interest in a psychological location, (2) a commitment to finding the African subject place, (3) the defense of African cultural elements, (4) a commitment to lexical refinement, and (5) a commitment to correct the dislocations in the history of Africa.\n\n"}

His track \"Say Goodbye to Love\" was nominated for Best Urban/Alternative Performance in the 2009 Grammy Awards. Kenna is the founder and producer of the Summit on the Summit clean water initiative, and also partnered with Justin Timberlake to re-imagine the social network Myspace before its purchase by Time Inc.\n\nKenna was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he was raised by his grandfather for the first three years of his life. His parents had escaped persecution and immigrated to England and later America; Kenna reunited with them in Cincinnati, Ohio when he was three years old.\n\nHe was later raised in Virginia Beach, Virginia, attending school with friends and eventual career-long collaborators Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams. Kenna began to express an interest in music upon receiving a copy of U2's \"The Joshua Tree\". The album inspired Kenna to teach himself piano while studying singers like Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, as well as groups like The Cure and Duran Duran. Breaking into the music scene at such a young age and at an interesting time in pop history, Kenna met some of music's biggest names including Whitney Houston, Babyface, Blackstreet, Teddy Riley and Michael Jackson.\n\nWith the release of his first single in 2001, \"Hell Bent\", Kenna gained moderate popularity and an underground following of fans who eagerly awaited the release of his debut album, \"New Sacred Cow\". After many delays and swapping of record labels, the album was finally released under the Sony imprint Flawless in 2003. A subsequent North American tour was launched in the Summer of 2003 with Depeche Mode front man Dave Gahan.\n\nThe album, which was co-produced by Chad Hugo of The Neptunes, contained elements of electronica, synthpop, post-rock, and house music. Two singles, \"Sunday After You\" and \"Freetime\" followed the release of the album; the music video of the latter, along with \"Hell Bent\", appeared sporadically on MTV2. \"Freetime\" reached #19 on the U.S. Dance charts.\n\nIn Malcolm Gladwell's book \"Blink\", which is about the way people judge and make decisions in their lives, a portion of one chapter focuses on the stops and starts and difficulties that Kenna experienced in getting his music accepted by the general public, despite the tremendous reception and enthusiasm that music executives, other musicians and a small, loyal fan base had when they heard his music.\n\nKenna's second album, entitled \"Make Sure They See My Face\", also co-produced by Hugo, was written over the course of three years, finishing in early 2007. The album was originally set to be released on June 5, 2007, then pushed back to June 19, 2007, finally being released on October 16, 2007. Kenna, in an interview with Vibe magazine, cited the reason for delays as being over the video for the album's debut single. The inspiration for the album came from Kenna's attempt to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, the title, inspired from phone calls by Pharrell asking Kenna; \"are you going to make sure they see your face?\". Kenna's climb took him to 18,200 feet before he fell ill from taking a sulfur-based altitude medicine, to which he had an unknown allergy. On October 23, 2007, the album debuted at #1 on the \"Billboard\" Top 20 Heatseekers Chart.\n\nAn unrelated song from his second album, \"Face the Gun\", was released to appease his waiting fans, and initially was not to appear on \"Make Sure They See My Face,\" missing from early promos of the album. Ultimately, it was included in the final track listing. Kenna released a track from the album, entitled \"Better Wise Up\", in time for the Super Bowl; this track can be found on his MySpace page, as well. A remix of \"Better Wise Up\" featuring Audio Imagery has been circulating the internet since August 2007. There has been no official word from Kenna or from his label about this remix.\n\nOn February 13, 2011, Kenna announced plans over Facebook and Twitter to release a series of 3 EPs with 3 songs each, titled the \"Land 2 Air Chronicles\", which will serve as the \"runway\" to his third album to be titled \"Songs for Flight\", described by Kenna as a \"first ever musical journey.\"\n\nThe first EP, titled \",\" was scheduled to be released on March 8, preceded by the first single \"Chains\". The song was streamed on Kenna's official website on February 22. On March 4, it was announced that there had been an unfortunate technical failure with the hard drive that stored the majority of the files that made up the songs for the EP and the album. Kenna rerecorded and reproduced all the songs, reworking the concept for the entire series. \"Chaos and the Darkness\" was eventually released on April 26, 2011, with \"Chains\" being available as a single on iTunes & Amazon on March 8.\n\nThe second volume of the \"Land 2 Air Chronicles\" series saw its release spanning three EPs, titled \"Imitation is Suicide Chapter I, Chapter II and Chapter III, \"respectively\". \"Four singles would accompany their release, including \"Relations (An Ode To You And Me)\", \"Long Gone\", \"Love Is Still Alive\" and \"How Will It End?\". All of them have an accompanying music video, with the exception of \"How Will It End?\". The video accompanying \"Long Gone\" was filmed in an Hitchcockian-style and also marks Kenna's directorial debut. It was released on MTV on October 17, 2012. Additionally, a remix to \"Relations\" featuring Childish Gambino was released on November 12, 2013.\n\nKenna announced the third and final volume, to be called \"Genius\". A demo of a track from the EP called \"Something to Break\" was streamed on Kenna's SoundCloud and social media pages.\n\nThe first single from \"Songs for Flight\", \"Sleep When We Die\", was released on July 15, 2015. It premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 Radio show on Apple Music, and was subsequently released for digital download.\n\nOn October 6, 2006, the world premiere of the song \"Out of Control (State of Emotion)\", from Kenna's EP entitled \"Black Goodbye Ride\", was played on East Village Radio on Authentic Shit with Mark Ronson; it became available on iTunes on December 19, 2006.\n\nOn July 7, 2007 Kenna opened the New Jersey portion of the Live Earth concert. He also toured with Nelly Furtado throughout various stops on her \"Loose\" tour.\n\nKenna has also worked with Lupe Fiasco on the remix of \"Say Goodbye to Love\", and The Cool Kids on the remix of \"Loose Wires.\"\n\n\"Out of Control\" appears in the soundtrack for the video games \"MLB 08 The Show\" and \"FIFA 08\".\n\nKenna and Chad Hugo produced the track \"Pretty Please\" for JoJo's 2010 mixtape Can't Take That Away from Me.\n\nKenna was also a featured celebrity in the HP You on You project advertisement.\n\n\"Never Let Me Down\", an unreleased track from the \"Make Sure They See My Face\" sessions, was released on the charity album \"Download to Donate for Haiti\" in 2010, in which the proceeds go to Music for Relief, Linkin Park's charity. This album also contains \"Resurrection\", a collaboration with Lupe Fiasco, which was accompanied by a music video.\n\nKenna also appears along with Pharrell Williams in the music video for their collaboration with Clipse, \"Life Change\".\n\nIn 2010, Kenna and Chad Hugo worked with Kid Cudi on a track unofficially titled \"Capcom!\" for a Street Fighter game. It was never officially released, but was streamed on the internet the following year.\n\nIn 2013, Kenna released a cover of the U2 song \"Gloria\" to his SoundCloud and Myspace pages, as a way to reach out to Bono, one of his biggest musical influences. He received a call from Bono shortly thereafter.\n\n\"Sleep When We Die\" was used to promote the launch of the Flipagram app in July 2015.\n\nWhen Kenna learned about the global water crisis affecting even his home village in Ethiopia, he decided to create the SUMMIT ON THE SUMMIT project, when he and friends Lupe Fiasco, Jessica Biel, Emile Hirsch and others climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro on January 7, 2010 to bring attention to the water crisis. The documentary on the climb aired on MTV on March 14, 2010.\n\nA new song called \"Turn\" was made available as a free download on his official MySpace for a limited time. It has since been released on the iTunes Store on January 26, 2010. Proceeds from the sales of the track are donated to the SUMMIT ON THE SUMMIT project.\n\nAfter some urging from friend and fellow musician Justin Timberlake, who also invested in the new Myspace, Kenna took a job as Chief Vision Officer in the company. Kenna was featured in the April 2013 Details Magazine issue as one of their 2013 \"Digital Mavericks\" entrepreneurs.\n\nKenna's strategic development company Translator serves as the umbrella for all of Kenna's endeavors, including his music, technology and philanthropic efforts. In March 2012, Translator in partnership with Myspace produced a successful outdoor concert featuring Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and Mumford & Sons at the annual South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. The event saw more than 12,000 attendees and 1.3 million livestream views on Myspace. Kenna continues to curate and consult on many projects in tandem with his own music endeavors.\n\n\n\n"}

The region is today administratively separated into two autonomous regions: North Caribbean Coast and South Caribbean Coast. Mosquito is the nickname that is given to the region and earlier residents by early Europeans who visited and settled in the area. The term \"\"Miskito\"\" is now more commonly used to refer to both the people and the language.\n\nMiskito creole is nearly identical to, and hence mutually intelligible with, Belizean Creole, and retains a high degree of intelligibility with all other Central American English creoles. It is also sometimes classified as a dialect of Jamaican Patois creole but this classification has been disputed.\n\nIt does not have the status of an official language in Nicaragua but it is a recognized language in the autonomous regions where it is spoken.\n\nSpeakers of Miskito Coast Creole are primarily persons of African, Amerindian, and European descent in the towns and on the offshore islands of the Miskito Coast. The main concentration of speakers is around Bluefields, capital of the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region, although a majority of inhabitants of the city are now Spanish-speaking immigrants.\n\nMost of the creole speakers are located along the banks of the large rivers and lagoons that surround the area. Communities are found in Waspán on the Coco River near Cape Gracias a Dios, in Laguna de Perlas, Puerto Cabezas, the offshore Corn Islands, Prinzapolka (Puerto Isabel), and San Juan del Norte (Greytown). Inland, the language is spoken in Siuna, Rosita, and Bonanza on the Prinzapolka River. On the Pacific coast, there are small numbers of speakers in Corinto, Puerto Sandino, and the Nicaraguan capital of Managua. A smaller portion of the population stays in large towns along the northern Caribbean coast of Nicaragua and some also reside in Managua as well as other Central American countries.\n\nRama Cay Creole is a variety of the language spoken by the Rama people on Rama Cay, an island in the Bluefields Lagoon.\n\nThe environment is that of a tropical rainforest with an average rainfall of 448 centimeters and temperatures that range 26.4 °C ( 79 °F ) and up.\n\nAfrican slaves were shipwrecked on the Mosquito Coast as early as 1640 and interaction between them and the local Miskito population commenced.\n\nThe modern day Creoles' ancestors came as slaves to the Nicaraguan caribbean coast from Africa between the 17th century and the late 18th century. They were originally brought there by the British to serve them in agriculture and the various labors. The Coast was officially under British protection from 1740 to 1787 according to the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the Miskito Kingdom and remained under British influence until the late 19th century.\n\nOver the period of time while they were here, the African population renewed and transformed their culture and traits by taking elements of their African culture and mixing it with their European masters along with the local Indian tribes which created a new culture. In the year of 1787, the British were forced to leave the mosquito coast due to a treaty that was put forth. Slaves who ran away or who were abandoned had made their own African communities at Bluefields. Many escaped slaves from other islands had also come over to this area to settle down. Great Britain signed the Treaty of Managua which gave a portion of an area to the natives there and allowed it to be self-governed. This allowed for the African communities to grow and flourish. Their culture became solid after gaining economic, political and social control over the Mosquito Coast. The people in the communities then began to start calling themselves Creoles.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, more English- or Creole-speaking laborers, primarily from Jamaica, were brought to the Coast as laborers. However, following the 1894 formal annexation of the Miskito Kingdom by Nicaragua, an increasing number of Spanish speakers migrated to the area.\n\nThe 1987 Constitution of Nicaragua granted autonomy to the Zelaya Department as two autonomous regions of the North and South Caribbean Coast. Autonomous status has allowed for the promotion and development of the languages of the Caribbean Coast and, , there was an education in English and Spanish, as well as education in indigenous languages.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, the coast was becoming more integrated economically and socially. The Creole people have now become a minority in the areas which they had previously been predominant in. Many Creoles now mostly speak Spanish as well as creole and consider themselves to be only Nicaraguan. There are many Creoles who have now intermarried with Mestizos even though many of them still protest on how they lost their political and economic power to them.\n\nThe Creoles of Nicaragua are said to be an Afro-Caribbean population that are mixed with Europeans, Africans and Amerindians. Their culture is influenced by West African and British roots along with mestizos and miskito. Some food that is used in their cooking consists of coconut oil, taro root, manioc and other elements such as wheat flour and other processed foods. They have their own musical style which can be compared to West Indian calypso.\n\nThe Nicaraguan Creole English language is spoken as a primary first language by only 35,000 to 50,000 Creoles, Nicaraguan Garifuna, and some Miskitos. The language is being quickly replaced with Spanish with fewer and fewer people speaking it. \"Creole English is used to an increasing degree in the churches (Decker & Keener 1998) and in bilingual education programs...virtually all reading is done in Spanish\" (Bartens 2013:116).\n\n\n\n"}

Including the right to health in Article 24, the right to social security in Article 25, the right to an adequate standard of living in Article 27, the right to education in Article 28, and the right to protection from economic exploitation (see child labour) in Article 32. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination prohibits discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin in relation to a number of economic, social and cultural rights. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women affirms a range of economic, social and cultural rights to women. The ILO Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) protect a range of work related economic, social and cultural rights. Common global standards were agreed by some 195 states in the Recommendation on Science and Scientific protect and reassert scientific freedoms, the rights of scientists, and rights of research subjects, and the right of everyone to science.\n\nThe African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights protects the right to work in Article 15, the right to health in Article 16, and the right to education in Article 17. The European Social Charter protects a wide range of economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to work, to favourable working conditions, the right to join trade unions and to take collective labour action in Article 1 to 10, the right to health in Article 11, the right to social security, including the right to medical assistance and the right to social welfare services, in Article 12 to 14, protection of especially vulnerable groups are enshrined in Article 15 to 17 and 19, and right to housing in Article 31. The Protocol of San Salvador protects a range of economic, social and cultural rights within the Inter-American human rights system.\n\nA range of secondary legal sources exist on economic, social and cultural rights which provide guidance on their normative definition. An important secondary legal source is the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which is overseeing the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). The Committee has been central in developing the normative definition of key economic, social and cultural rights, interpreting the role of State Parties to the ICESCR, and monitoring protection and violation of the ICESCR rights. The Committee issues guiding pronouncements in the form of \"general comments\", and other human rights treaty bodies may also issue comments relevant to economic, social and cultural rights.\n\nOther important secondary legal sources on economic, social and cultural rights are the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1987 and the Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1997. The Limburg Principles have been extensively used in national legal systems as an interpretive tool for establishing violations of economic, social and cultural rights. The Maastricht Guidelines build on the Limburg Principles and identify the legal implications of acts and omissions which are violations of economic, social and cultural rights. Various United Nations Special Rapporteurs have influenced the normative development of economic, social and cultural rights. Appointed by the Commission on Human Rights and its sub-commissions, key rapporteurs include the Special Rapporteur on the Realization of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, and the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women.\n\nA number of national constitutions recognize economic, social and cultural rights. For example, the 1996 Constitution of South Africa includes economic, social and cultural rights and the South African Constitutional Court has heard claims under these obligations (see \"Grootboom\" and \"Treatment Action Campaign\" cases). India's constitution, which does not explicitly recognize economic and social rights in their constitution, has nonetheless found that these rights exist, though unenumerated, inferable from the right to life. \n\nConstitutional recognition of economic, social and cultural rights has long been thought to be counterproductive, given that courts might be tasked to adjudicate them, and hence disrupt the democratic chains of accountability of the so-called elected branches. Nonetheless, a growing literature from the Global South has tracked very different judicial responses.\n\nEconomic, social and cultural right enshrined in international and regional human rights instruments are legally binding. Member states have a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil these rights. The exact nature of states' obligations in this respect has been established principally in relation to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and further Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has been established in accordance with Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action\n\nState parties to the ICESCR are required to take \"progressive action\" towards fulfilment of the ICESR rights. While immediate fulfilment may not be possible due to the economic situation of a country, postponement of proactive action is not permitted. State parties must show genuine efforts to secure the economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in the ICESCR. The burden of proof for progressive action is considered on be with the state party. The prohibition on discrimination in relation to economic, social and cultural rights is regarded as having immediate effect. State parties must abolish laws, policies and practices which affect the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and take action to prevent discrimination in public life. All state parties, regardless of the economic situation in the country or resource scarcity, are required to ensure respect for minimum subsistence rights for all. State parties must also ensure that available resources are accessed and used equitably. Therefore, government decisions on how to allocate resources should be subject to scrutiny. Legislative measures alone are not sufficient to ensure compliance with the ICESCR and state parties are expected to provide judicial remedies in addition to taking administrative, financial, educational and social measures.\n\nIntergovernmental organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have persistently neglected economic, social and cultural rights over the past 50 years. While all human rights are said to be \"equal, indivisible, interrelated, and interdependent\", the monitoring, enforcement and implementation framework for economic, social and cultural rights is less advanced than that for civil and political rights. International enforcement mechanisms are strongest for civil and political rights, and their violation is considered more serious than that of economic, social and cultural rights. There are few international NGOs that focus on economic, social and cultural rights and there are few lawyers who have the knowledge or experience to defend economic, social and cultural rights at a national or international level. Economic, social and cultural rights are less likely than civil and political rights to be protected in national constitutions.\n\nIn 2008, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which gives the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights competence to receive and consider communications from individuals claiming that their rights under the Covenant have been violated by a state party. The Protocol entered into force on 5 May 2013.\n\nIn 2017, for the common global standards in the Recommendation on Science and Scientific Researchers relating to the right to science, states agreed at the UNESCO General Conference to adopt four-yearly reporting on implementation, and agreed that UNESCO's Executive Board is competent to manage monitoring, with the networks of UNESCO National Commissions and academic partners mobilized in countries to ensure implementation and monitoring at country level.For the other major international human rights conventions mentioned above there are various other treaty bodies to ensure some monitoring of implementation. And each may transmit to the Human Rights Council reports of individual cases when a state is the subject of a Universal Periodic Review.\n\nEducation is guaranteed as a human right in many human rights treaties, including:\n\n\nThe right to education places the individual at the centre of education frameworks.\n\nEducation as a human right has the following characteristics:\n\n\nThe right to education places legal obligations on states when they make decisions regarding education and the education system. It offers an internationally agreed normative framework for the standards that states must not fall beneath concerning the education of its citizens and non-citizens.\n\nThese standards define what states must do and avoid doing in order to ensure the dignity of the individual. The right to education is broad and covers many aspects of education. This means that for the specific areas related to education, states must act within the boundaries permitted under international human rights law (IHRL).\n\nThe main aspects of education are:\n\n\nNetworking groups such as ESCR-Net are working to create online resources and spread information about effective cases, initiatives, and working groups promoting ideals and celebrating victories of human rights initiatives and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Currently, human rights advocacy groups are working diligently to fine-tune rules, regulations and implementation schemes; little news of complaint successes or failures is available. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE) has helped to establish the Housing and Property Directorate (HPD/HPCC) in Kosovo.\n\nAccording to Karel Vasak's theory of three generations of human rights, economic, social and cultural rights are considered second-generation rights, while civil and political rights, such as freedom of speech, right to a fair trial, and the right to vote, are considered first-generation rights. The theory of negative and positive rights considers economic, social and cultural rights positive rights.\n\n"}
{"id": "2069491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069491", "title": "Modality (semiotics)", "text": "Modality (semiotics)\n\nIn semiotics, a modality is a particular way in which information is to be encoded for presentation to humans, i.e. to the type of sign and to the status of reality ascribed to or claimed by a sign, text, or genre. It is more closely associated with the semiotics of Charles Peirce (1839–1914) than Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) because meaning is conceived as an effect of a set of signs. In the Peircean model, a reference is made to an \"object\" when the sign (or \"representamen\") is interpreted recursively by another sign (which becomes its \"interpretant\"), a conception of meaning that does in fact imply a classification of sign types.\n\nThe psychology of perception suggests the existence of a common cognitive system that treats all or most sensorily conveyed meanings in the same way. If all signs must also be objects of perception, there is every reason to believe that their modality will determine at least part of their nature. Thus, the sensory modalities will be visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, kinesthetic, etc. A list of sign types would include: writing, symbol, index, image, map, graph, diagram, etc. Some combinations of signs can be multi-modal, i.e. different types of signs grouped together for effect. But the distinction between a \"medium\" and a modality should be clarified: \nSo, the \"modality\" refers to a certain type of information and/or the representation format in which information is stored. The \"medium\" is the means whereby this information is delivered to the senses of the interpreter. Natural language is the primary modality, having many invariant properties across the auditory media as spoken language, the visual media as written language, the tactile media as Braille, and kinetic media as sign language. When meaning is conveyed by spoken language, it is converted into sound waves broadcast by the speaker and received by another's ears. Yet this stimulus cannot be divorced from the visual evidence of the speaker's manner and gestures, and the general awareness of the physical location and its possible connotative significance. Similarly, meaning that is contained in a visual form cannot be divorced from the iconicity and implications of the form. If handwritten, is the writing neat or does it evidence emotion in its style. What type of paper is used, what colour ink, what kind of writing instrument: all such questions are relevant to an interpretation of the significance of what is represented. But images are distinguishable from natural language. For Roland Barthes (1915–80), language functions with relatively determinate meanings whereas images \"say\" nothing. Nevertheless, there is a rhetoric for arranging the parts that are to signify, and an emerging, if not yet generally accepted, syntax that articulates their parts and binds them into an effective whole. Rhetorician Thomas Rosteck defined rhetoric \"as the use of language and other symbolic systems to make sense of our experiences, construct our personal and collective identities, produce meaning, and prompt action in the world\".\n\n\n"}

The number of native speakers is unknown, but 1986 estimates suggests that there are fewer than 60,000 native and second language speakers combined.\n\nLimonese is very similar structurally and lexically to the Jamaican Creole spoken in Jamaica and Panama and to a lesser extent other English-based creoles of the region, such as Colón Creole, Mískito Coastal Creole, Belizian Kriol, and San Andrés and Providencia Creole; many of these are also somewhat mutually intelligible to Limonese and each other.\nThe name \"Mekatelyu\" is a transliteration of the phrase \"make I tell you\", or in standard English \"let me tell you\".\n\nIn Costa Rica, one common way to refer to Limonese is by the term \"patois\", a word of French origin used to refer to provincial Gallo-Romance languages of France that were historically considered to be unsophisticated \"broken French\"; these include Provençal, Occitan and Norman among many others.\n\nLimonese developed from Jamaican Creole that was introduced to the Limón Province by Jamaican migrant workers who arrived to work on the construction of the Atlantic railway, the banana plantations and on the Pacific railway. During the Atlantic slave trade, British colonizers in Jamaica and elsewhere in the British West Indies delivered African slaves from various regions of Africa who did not speak a common language so various creoles developed to facilitate communication between them, largely influenced by slavers' English.\n\nEarly forms of Limonese had to adjust for context that they were being used in so two language registers developed, one mutually intelligible to and heavily influenced by English for formal contexts and a common vernacular used among Limonese speakers in informal contexts.\n\nLimonese is a regional language in Costa Rica and therefore does not have the official status in the country.\nThere is controversy about what should be taught in Limón schools alongside Spanish, Limonese or Standard English. Proponents of Limonese education argue that education in it would conserve cultural identity and history of those African descendants, while proponents of English see English as a more vital option in a globalizing world where English is a \"lingua franca\", emphasizing bilingualism in Spanish and English, two of most widely spoken languages in the world.\n\nSome linguists are undecided on the categorization of Limonese. According to some authors, Limonese should be treated as a separate language altogether while others contend that it is merely a part of a dialect continuum between English and Jamaican Patois. \n\nLimonese is documented to have been and is being gradually decreolized.\n\n\n\n"}

The language is also known as \"San Andrés Creole\", \"Bende\" and \"Islander Creole English\".\n\n\nSan Andrés–Providencia Creole is an official language in its territory of influence according to the Colombian Constitution of 1991 that guarantees the rights and protections of languages in the country.

Beer is served in a range of locales, from neighbourhood shebeens to upscale bars. Many countries have standardized beer bottle sizes, which are cleaned and re-used, and so when buying beer at a store often people must pay a deposit on the bottle as well as the price of the beer. An alternative to glass-bottle beers is local beer sold in tetra-pak style paper cartons.\n\nSouth Africa consumes the most beer of any African country, with an average of 60 litres of beer consumed per person annually.\n\nThe brewing of traditional beer is a common practice among Africans in rural areas. Varieties and types of beer depend on local customs and resources. Among various beers brewed locally are ginger beers and honey beers.\n\nUnited National Breweries, amongst others, produces Johannesburg beer and the popular, if stigmatized, Chibuku beer is popular throughout Southern African countries.\n\nIn South Africa and Botswana, sorghum malt is used as an important ingredient. Elsewhere, maize is the primary ingredient and the beer is more commonly known as opaque beer.\n\nThe most popular brands are Castel and 33 Export, and in larger cities Beaufort, Beaufort Lite, Mützig Lager, Guinness, Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, and Guinness Smooth can be found. Local brews include palm wine in the southern part of the country and millet beer called \"bil-bil\" in the north.\n\nNgok is a popular beer only available in Congo, which makes it a popular choice to sneak across the border to DRC. Its logo is a crocodile.\n\nMost beers in Congo (DRC) are brewed by Heineken with the most popular being Primus.\n\nRégab is the most widely distributed domestically brewed beer in Gabon. \n\nBeer has been widely consumed in Ethiopia for a while and as a result the country enjoys a variety of beer brands. Historically the most popular of these brands is St. George Beer (named after the country's patron saint) which is the country's oldest brewery, established in 1922. More recently the introduction of foreign beer brands like Heineken has created a lot of competition in the market, increasing investment in the farming sector. This influx of capital has led to the country to being more self-sufficient in such area as Malt production. Many traditional Ethiopian brands including Meta, Harar, and Bedele were acquired by Heineken's parent company and re-branded. \n\nSome of the best Ethiopian brands include:\n\nGolden Star, brewed by the Golden Star Brewery, is the unique beer in Eritrea after the closing of Asmara Brewery (ex Melotti) which had been brewing beer since the colonial era.\n\nTusker, brewed by the Kenya Breweries Limited, is the most-popular beer in Kenya. Popularly known as \"Keroro\" beer, Tusker is a source of Kenyan pride highlighted in the late 1990s, when East African Breweries waged a marketing war against Castle Breweries, a subsidiary of international brewing giant SABMiller. In this media campaign, Castle, which had constructed a multimillion-dollar brewery in the industrial town of Thika, was depicted as foreign and uncommitted to Kenya. The prolonged marketing wars came to an end in 2002, when the two brewers reached a settlement in which they divided the beer market in East Africa among themselves. Castle agreed to exit Kenya, and EABL decided to leave the Tanzanian market to the SABMiller subsidiary.\n\nBeer (known as \"pombe\" in Swahili) is an integral part of Tanzanian society and local brands hold a strong sense of national pride and economic value.

Chibuku Shake Shake is made from a mix of sorghum and maize. In Zimbabwe it is known as \"scud\". It is sold in paper cartons or brown plastic containers with a wide blue lid. It is thought to be a drink for lower-class people. This thick brown millet beer costs less than a dollar and it is shaken vigorously before drinking it because of its thick layer of sediment collected on the bottom of the carton. It has a powerful yeast flavor that is offset by a lemony tang. Standard practice is to slurp any remaining sediment at the bottom of the container.\n\nKgalagadi Breweries Limited, a subsidiary of SAB Miller, produces St Louis.

The Ducks compete at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level as a member of the Pac-12 Conference. With eighteen varsity teams, Oregon is best known for its American football team and track and field program, which has helped Eugene gain a reputation as \"Track Town, USA\". Oregon's main rivalries are with the Oregon State Beavers (the Civil War) and the Washington Huskies, though they also have a major rivalry with the Washington State Cougars.\n\nOregon teams were originally known as Webfoots, possibly as early as the 1890s. The Webfoots name originally applied to a group of fishermen from the coast of Massachusetts who had been heroes during the American Revolutionary War; their descendants had settled in Oregon's Willamette Valley in the 19th century and the name stayed with them. A naming contest in 1926 won by \"Oregonian\" sports editor L. H. Gregory made the Webfoots name official, and a subsequent student vote in 1932 affirmed the nickname, chosen over other suggested nicknames such as Pioneers, Trappers, Lumberjacks, Wolves, and Yellow Jackets.\n\nDucks, with their webbed feet, began to be associated with the team in the 1920s, and live duck mascots were adopted to represent the team. Journalists, especially headline writers, also adopted the shorter Duck nickname, but it wasn't until the 1940s that the image of Donald Duck, permitted via a handshake deal between Walt Disney and Oregon athletic director Leo Harris, cemented the image of the Duck as the school's mascot. Both nicknames were still in use well into the 1970s.\n\nIn 1978, a student cartoonist came up with a new duck image, but students rejected the alternative by a 2-to-1 margin. Although Donald wasn't on that ballot, the University Archivist declared that the election made Ducks the school's official mascot, replacing Webfoots.\n\nThe University of Oregon sponsors teams in eight men's and twelve women's NCAA sanctioned sports, primarily competing in the Pac-12 Conference and acrobatics & tumbling competing in the National Collegiate Acrobatics & Tumbling Association, and lacrosse and indoor track & field teams competing in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.\n\nThe football program began in 1893 and played its first game on February 22, 1894, defeating Albany College 46-0. The football team moved to its new home, Hayward Field in 1919 where it shared the facility with the track and field team until Autzen Stadium was completed in 1967.\n\nWinning its first Rose Bowl in 1917 against the University of Pennsylvania under head coach Hugo Bezdek, the Ducks have returned to the Rose Bowl seven additional times in 1920, 1957, 1995, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2020;. While in the Pacific Coast Conference, the Ducks won five conference co-championships in 1919, 1933, 1948, and 1957. The Pacific Coast Conference was disbanded in 1958, and the Ducks played as an independent until they joined the PCC's effective successor, the Pacific-8 Conference (then officially the Athletic Association of Western Universities), which later became the Pacific-10 Conference and eventually the Pac-12 Conference, in 2011. In the Pac-8/10/12, they have won seven conference championships (1994, 2001, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2019) and shared one championship (2000). The Ducks were 3–2 during the BCS era, winning the 2002 Fiesta Bowl, the 2012 Rose Bowl, and the 2013 Fiesta Bowl and losing the 2010 Rose Bowl and the 2011 BCS National Championship Game.\n\nIn 2014, Oregon won a school record 13 games and saw junior quarterback Marcus Mariota win the school's first Heisman Trophy. That same year, the Ducks made the first ever College Football Playoff and beat the defending champion Florida State Seminoles 59–20 in the 2015 Rose Bowl semi-final. The loss to Oregon ended the Seminoles 29 game win streak and moved the Ducks into the final. They made the first ever CFP National Championship Game where they lost 42–20 to Ohio State.\n\nThe Ducks men's basketball team played its first season in 1902-1903 under head coach Charles Burden. It was not until 1927 that the Ducks played their first game at McArthur Court, defeating Willamette University 38-10. Head coach Howard Hobson was hired in 1936 and took the basketball team nicknamed \"The Tall Firs\" to win the first NCAA Men's Basketball Championship in 1939. The Tall Firs achieved a 29-5 record, capped by a 46-33 victory over Ohio State University in the championship game. in the inaugural year for the event.\n\nThe Ducks men's team would add only one more shared Pacific Coast Conference title to their two until winning the Pacific-10 Conference title in the 2001-2002 season under head coach Ernie Kent. The Ducks would also make an Elite Eight appearance in the NCAA Tournament that season along with the 2006-2007 season. In 2010-2011, the Ducks moved into the new Matthew Knight Arena and welcomed new coach Dana Altman. Since, Altman has won three Pac-12 Conference Coach of the Year honors (2013, 2015, 2016) and led Oregon to the 2013 Pac-12 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament Championship. In addition, Altman has taken Oregon to four straight NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament for the first time in program history (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016), including a trip to the Sweet 16 in 2013 and the Elite 8 in 2016. The Ducks won the 2015-2016 Pac-12 Conference Tournament. This led to the Ducks being the top seed in the West Regional of the 2015-2016 NCAA tournament, its first ever top seeding in the NCAA tournament. The Ducks defeated Holy Cross and Saint Joseph's in the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament to advance to the Sweet 16 in Anaheim, where they defeated the number four seed and defending national champion Duke Blue Devils, 82-68, to advance to the Elite 8.\n\nOn the women's side, three outstanding players and sure thing first-round draft picks—Sabrina Ionescu scored 30, Satou Sabally made 25, and Ruthy Hebard—led the No. 1 ranked Ducks to a 93-86 victory over Team USA in November 2019. Their formidable opponents have won 6 consecutive Olympic gold medals, the 2018 World Cup, and already qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and included WNBA stars Diana Taurasi, Sue Bird, Nneka Ogwumike, and Sylvia Fowles. The exhibition game was Team USA's first loss to a college team in 20 years.\n\nThe University of Oregon Cross Country and Track & Field programs have a particularly long and storied history, earning Eugene the nickname Track Town, United States. After several years of struggling, Bill Hayward became the head coach in 1903 and provided solid direction for the program for 44 years, coaching Daniel Kelly and Ralph Hill to Olympic Silver Medals. After Hayward's retirement in 1947, his trainee Bill Bowerman took over the head coaching position in 1949.\nBill Bowerman became a legendary coach, winning numerous NCAA team Championships at Oregon and coached many to All-American and Olympian status such as Steve Prefontaine. His talents were not limited to the track, as he also co-founded Nike, pressured the Amateur Athletic Union to improve its services, and brought the Olympic Trials and NCAA Championships to Hayward Field.\n\nBill Bowerman retired in 1973 and his assistant coach, Bill Dellinger became the head coach who brought four NCAA Cross Country Championships and one NCAA Track & Field Championship.\n\nSteve Prefontaine, who ran at Oregon in the early 1970s, was a legend in his own right, setting 13 American records in seven separate events and only lost three races at Hayward Field during the span of his career. He won seven NCAA championships and today, the Prefontaine Classic is held every year at Hayward Field in his honor.\n\nThe program has garnered numerous NCAA national titles across all the disciplines.\n\nThe Ducks baseball team first played in 1877, the year following the establishment of the university. In 1981, baseball was dropped due to budgetary concerns. Baseball would be reinstated 26 years later by interim athletic director Patrick Kilkenny and played its first game in 2009. George Horton, who led the Cal State Fullerton baseball team to an NCAA national championship, was hired in 2007 to lead the reinstated Oregon Ducks baseball program. In his second year, Horton guided the team in to a 40-24 record and a berth in the NCAA regionals.\n\nOregon Softball plays home games at the new Jane Sanders Stadium. Oregon has had recent success under Coach Mike White who has taken Oregon to the Women's College World Series (WCWS) four times in the last 6 years. Oregon has appeared in seven WCWS, in 1976, 1980, 1989, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2017. In 2014 and 2017, the Ducks reached the national semi-finals.\n\nThe Oregon Volleyball program are coached by Matt Ulmer and play its home games at Matthew Knight Arena. They have appeared in the NCAA Tournament 16 times including the 2012 National Title Game. Oregon defeated #1 Penn State in the National Semi-Finals before losing to eventual champion Texas in the title match.\n\nThe Ducks also have varsity teams in women's basketball, golf, tennis, lacrosse, soccer, team stunts and gymnastics.\n\nFounded in 1961, the University of Oregon Rugby Football Club plays Division 1 college rugby in the Northwest collegiate rugby conference against local rivals such as Washington and Washington State. Oregon's biggest rivalry, however, is their \"civil war\" matchup against in-state rival Oregon State University. Oregon plays its home games at Riverfront Field. The Ducks have been led by head coach Pate Tuisue since 2012.\n\nThe University of Oregon Women's Club Rugby Team has been coached by Greg Farrell since 1998. They are a part of the Pacific Mountain Rugby Conference. During their league season they will play University of Washington, Washington State University, Oregon State, Boise State University, and Western Washington University. For the past couple years the team's main rival has been Washington State University. Oregon Women's also plays on Riverfront field.\n\nThe Ducks compete at the Pacific 8 Intercollegiate Hockey Conference of the American Collegiate Hockey Association Division II.\n\nOregon has won 33 NCAA National Championships.\n\n\nBelow are four national team titles that are not bestowed by the NCAA:\n\n\n\nThe Oregon Ducks football complex is located north of the main campus. The complex includes Autzen Stadium where the games are played, the Len Casanova Center where the locker rooms and training facilities are located, the indoor practice field called the Moshofsky Center, and the outdoor training field named Kilkenny Field. Much of the cost of the state-of-the-art facilities were paid for by the prominent university boosters Phil Knight, Ed Moshofsky, and Patrick Kilkenny.\n\nAlso in the football complex is PK Park, the University of Oregon baseball stadium, completed in 2009 for the reemergence of the baseball program, located in the northeast corner of the parking lot.\n\nThe basketball teams along with other court-based sports play at Matthew Knight Arena, dubbed \"Matt Court\" in a play on McArthur Court's longstanding nickname \"Mac Court\", the Oregon Ducks' main court through the first part of the 2010–11 season.\n\nHayward Field was originally constructed for the football team in 1919 and in 1921, a track was installed to accommodate the track team. Today, it is the home of the Oregon Ducks track and field team. This storied venue has been the host of the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships twelve times. The Olympic Trials have been hosted at this venue four times.\n\nJane Sanders Stadium, the newest Ducks sports venue, located at the south end of campus, opened in March 2016 as the home diamond for the Ducks softball team.\n\nThe Oregon Ducks have an in-state rivalry with the Oregon State Beavers in which they play for the Platypus Trophy. The rivalry, dubbed the Civil War, has been scored across ten different sports that the two universities share over the past nine years. The series is currently tied 4-4-1.\n\nThe Oregon Ducks and the Washington Huskies have enjoyed a border rivalry that many consider to be even more fierce than the respective teams’ in-state rivalries. The rivalry began to build steam in 1948, when the Ducks and the California Golden Bears tied for the conference win and the Huskies’ vote went to Cal which inked them in for a trip to the Rose Bowl. A few years later, there was a move to remove Oregon, Oregon State, and Washington State from the Pacific Coast Conference (whose history the Pac-10 claims as its own) and the Huskies did not object.\n\nThe University of Oregon is commonly referred to as the University of Nike due to the influence of Nike co-founder Phil Knight's influence through his donations to the school over the years. Knight ran in the University of Oregon Track & Field program under Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 with a bachelor's degree in accounting and went on to earn an M.B.A. at Stanford University. Knight returned to Oregon and with Bowerman, also a University of Oregon alumnus, later founded Blue Ribbon Sports in 1964, which officially became Nike in 1978. In 1970, Bowerman revolutionized the athletic shoe by pouring molten rubber into a waffle iron, creating a prototype rubber sole. University of Oregon distance runner Steve Prefontaine became the first major track athlete to wear Nike shoes and converted many of his peers to the Nike brand.\n\nNike has maintained a close relationship with UO ever since, manufacturing all university logo clothing and uniforms for athletic teams, including research prototypes for high-tech \"smart clothes\", such as jerseys with cooling systems. Numerous University of Oregon graduates have also gone on to become executives, designers, and business partners of Nike such as Tinker Hatfield and Dan Wieden.\n\nPhil Knight has personally donated significant amounts to the University for both academic and athletic aspirations, including significant amounts toward the Knight Library, the Knight Law Center, numerous endowed chairs, support for the track & field program, the Autzen Stadium expansion, and a $100 million donation to create the Oregon Athletics Legacy Fund.\n\nControversy surrounding Nike's labor practices precipitated protests in 2000 led by a group of students calling themselves the Human Rights Alliance. Protests included a 10-day tent city occupation of the lawns in front of Johnson Hall, the main administration building, demanding the university join the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC).\n\nUniversity President Dave Frohnmayer signed a one-year contract with the WRC, causing Phil Knight to withdraw a previous $30 million commitment toward the Autzen Stadium expansion project and no further donations toward the University. Nike, since 1998, had actively improved worker conditions abroad and strongly endorsed the Fair Labor Association, an association with similar aspirations of the WRC but with origins and board members from the apparel industry, including Nike. In a public statement, Phil Knight criticized the WRC for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided while praising the FLA for being balanced in its approach. The students disagreed, saying the FLA has conflicting interests, but President Dave Frohnmayer along with several others agreed with Knight in that the WRC provides unbalanced representation.\n\nCiting a legal opinion from the University Counsel, President Frohnmayer in October 2000, released a statement saying that the University could not pay its membership dues for the WRC since the WRC was neither an incorporated entity nor had tax-exempt status and to do so was a violation of state law. The Oregon University System on February 16, 2001 enacted a mandate that all institutions within the OUS choose business partners from a politically neutral standpoint, barring all universities in Oregon from membership in the WRC and the FLA. Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Phil Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over $50 million. Since then, activity on the subject died down and Frohnmayer believed that the leaders of the protest lost their foothold since they did not represent the majority of students on campus.\n\nThe relationship between the University of Oregon and Nike was the topic of the book, \"University of Nike\" by Joshua Hunt. In the book, Hunt describes the influence that Nike held over university administrators as well as the strong arm tactics Nike employed to the benefit of corporate interests under the guise of philanthropy. The book also points to this relationship as a bellwether as other U.S. states reduce higher education funding, resulting in universities accepting a greater percentage of their funding from corporate sources with their corresponding interests.\n\n"}

William Park Weir became Surveyor of Customs in the Port of Montreal. His brother, Robert Stanley Weir, would become famous as a judge and author of the English verses for O Canada.\n\nWeir was educated at the High School of Montreal and McGill University, earning a B.C.L. degree in 1881, and was called to the Bar of Quebec on July 12, 1881.\n\nHe married Adelaide Sayers Stewart, daughter of William C. Stewart of Hamilton, Ontario in October 1885.\n\nDuring the time he practised law, Weir also wrote for \"The Montreal Star\" from 1880–1881 and the \"Argenteuil County News\" from 1895–1897.\n\nWeir published several special editions of Quebec Civil Codes and he served as Secretary of the Royal Commission to revise the Code of Civil Procedure in 1897.\n\nWeir's first attempt at election to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in 1890 failed. In 1897, he ran again and succeeded in winning the riding of Argenteuil, representing the Liberal Party of Quebec.\n\nHe was appointed Minister without Portfolio in 1903 under Premier Simon-Napoléon Parent. On February 3, 1905, Weir, Lomer Gouin, and Adélard Turgeon joined forces and resigned from Cabinet in a push to force Parent out of the leadership. Gouin then became Premier on March 21, 1905 and Weir served as Minister without Portfolio (1905), Speaker (1905–1906), Minister of Public Works and Labour (1906–1907), and Provincial Treasurer (1907–1910).\n\nUpon appointment as a judge for the Quebec Superior Court on January 11, 1910, Weir resigned his seat. He presided over the Workman libel trial in May 1911.\n\nHe finished his career becoming a Montreal District Court judge in 1923.\n\nWilliam Alexander Weir died on October 22, 1929 in London, England.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a younger brother to the physicist, philosopher and theologian Nils Wallerius. \n\nJohan Gottschalk entered Uppsala University in 1725, and graduated as magister in 1731 after studies of mathematics, physics and medicine. He continued his studies at Lund University, where he received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1735. After this graduation, he came back to Uppsala where he opened a course in chemistry in his laboratory. This course allowed students in pharmacy and chemistry to witness demonstrations and practice themselves with the experiments. The popularity of this teaching allowed Wallerius to become adjunct of medicine at Uppsala University in 1741 and the first holder of a new professorship of chemistry, medicine and pharmacy in 1750. The same year, Wallerius was elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He retired from the chemistry chair in 1767 and was succeeded by his student Torbern Bergman. \n\nWallerius is regarded as the founder of agricultural chemistry, mainly based on the significance of his widely disseminated work \"Agriculturae fundamenta chemica\" (1761, published in Swedish the same year as \"Åkerbrukets chemiska grunder\" and later translated into many other languages). He published several other studies on chemical, mineralogical and geological subjects and used his own farm Hagelstena in Alsike (south of Uppsala) as an experimental field. He spent his early retirement from the University due to poor health applying the principles of chemistry as a way to improve agriculture in his own farm, and published some of his findings in \"Rön, rörande landtbruket. Om svenska åkerjordartenas egenskaper och skiljemerken samt deras förbättring genom tienlig jordblanning\", which was awarded the price of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. \nThe first freestanding chemical laboratory building in Uppsala, still standing at Västra Ågatan 24 by the River Fyris, was erected during his time as professor.\n\n"}
{"id": "2069562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069562", "title": "Quillwork", "text": "Quillwork\n\nQuillwork is a form of textile embellishment traditionally practiced by Native Americans that employs the quills of porcupines as an aesthetic element. Quills from bird feathers were also occasionally used in quillwork.\n\nPorcupine quillwork is an art form completely unique to North America. Before the introduction of glass beads, quillwork was a major decorative element used by the peoples who resided in the porcupine's natural habitat, which included indigenous peoples of the Subarctic, Northeastern Woodlands, and Northern Plains. The use of quills in designs spans from Maine to Alaska. Quillworking tools were discovered in Alberta, Canada and date back to the 6th century CE.\n\nCheyenne oral history, as told by Picking Bones Woman to George Bird Grinnell, says quilling came to their tribe from a man who married a woman, who hid her true identity as a buffalo. His son was also a buffalo. The man visited his wife and son in their buffalo home, and, while among the buffalo, the man learned the art of quilling, which he shared with the women of his tribe.\n\nJoining the Cheyenne Quilling Society was a prestigious honor for Cheyenne women. Upon entering the Society, women would work first on quilling moccasins, then cradleboards, rosettes for men's shirts and tipis, and ultimately, hide robes and backrests.\n\nPorcupine quills often adorned rawhide and tanned hides, but during the 19th century, quilled birch bark boxes were a popular trade item to sell to European-Americans among Eastern and Great Lakes tribes. Quillwork was used to create and decorate a variety of Native American items, including those of daily usage to Native American men and women. These include clothing such as coats and moccasins, accessories such as bags and belts, and furniture attachments such as a cradle cover.\n\nQuills suitable for embellishment are two to three inches long and may be dyed before use. In their natural state, the quills are pale yellow to white with black tips. The tips are usually snipped off before use. Quills readily take dye, which originally was derived from local plants and included a wide spectrum of colors, with black, yellow, and red being the most common. By the 19th century, aniline dyes were available through trade and made dying easier.\n\nThe quills can be flattened with specific bone tools or by being run through one's teeth. Awls were used to punch holes in hides, and sinew, later replaced by European thread, was used to bind the quills to the hides.\n\nThe four most common techniques for quillwork are appliqué, embroidery, wrapping, and loom weaving. Appliquéd quills are stitched into hide in a manner that covers the stitches. In wrapping, a single quill may be wrapped upon itself or two quills may be intertwined.\n\nQuills can be appliquéd singly to form curvilinear patterns, as found on Odawa pouches from the 18th century. This technique lends itself to floral designs popularized among northeastern tribes by Ursuline nuns. Huron women excelled at floral quillwork during the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nPlains quillwork is characterized by bands of rectangles creating geometrical patterns found also in Plains painting. Rosettes of concentric circles of quillwork commonly adorned historical Plains men's shirts, as did parallel panels of quillwork on the sleeves. These highly abstracted designs had layers of symbolic meaning.\n\nThe Red River Ojibwe of Manitoba created crisp, geometric patterns by weaving quills on a loom in the 19th century.\n\nQuillwork never died out as a living art form in the Northern Plains. Some communities that had lost their quillwork tradition have been able to revive the art form. For instance, no women quilled in the Dene community of Wha Ti, Northwest Territories by the late 1990s. The Dene Cultural Institute held two workshops there in 1999 and 2000, effectively reviving quillwork in Wha Ti.\n\nThe art form is very much alive today. Examples of contemporary, award-winning quillworkers include Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty, (Sioux-Assiniboine) artist; Dorothy Brave Eagle (Oglala Lakota) of Denver, Colorado; Kanatiiosh (Akwesasne Mohawk) of St. Regis Mohawk Reservation; Sarah Hardisty (Dene) of Jean Marie River, Northwest Territories; Leonda Fast Buffalo Horse (Blackfeet) of Browning, Montana; and Deborah Magee Sherer (Blackfeet) of Cut Bank, Montana.\n\nNorthern Lakes College of Alberta, Canada teaches a college-level course in quillwork art.\n\n\n\n"}

Hammar, (born 18 February 1943) is a Swedish clergyman. He was Archbishop of Uppsala, head of the Church of Sweden, from 1997 to 2006. During his tenure as archbishop he was a highly divisive figure, who gained strong support from some and drew heavy criticism from others, and he oversaw the separation of church and state in Sweden on 1 January 2000. He holds a PhD and is the author of several books on theology.\n\nHis father a priest, he was ordained priest in the Diocese of Lund in 1965, at the age of 22. From 1972 to 1975 he worked as a teacher at Trinity Theological College in Singapore. He returned home to work as a priest in the Church of Sweden in Lund. In 1992, he became bishop and head of the diocese, and in 1997 he was appointed Archbishop by the Social Democrat-controlled Government of Sweden under the state church which was then still formally in place but lost its true standing already in 1958 and was on its way to be officially abolished. Soon after his appointment, he ordained Christina Odenberg, the first Swedish woman to become a bishop.\n\n\"\"I don´t know the truth - I am just seeking it\" \n- K.G. Hammar\"\n\nAs the head of the church, he gained much popularity as well as criticism for his strong opinions, which emphasized humanism and tolerance according to his supporters, and was highly politically partisan and inappropriate for his position according to his critics, who saw him more as a left wing politician than a clergyman. He fought for extended amnesty for refugees and illegal immigrants in Sweden, debt relief for poor countries, more humane treatment of prisoners and tolerance towards followers of other religions than Christianity. He also criticised the invasion of Iraq and global capitalism, and urged for a boycott against goods from Israeli settlements. The former leader of the Swedish Christian Democrat party Alf Svensson has called Hammar a \"leftist populist\" and the then-party leader of the Moderate Party Bo Lundgren called on Hammar to either stop using his post as a political platform or to resign and stand for election as a leftist politician instead.\n\nHammar is an outspoken supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.\n\nHammar also expressed liberal theological views and spoke out frequently for the rights of homosexuals to adopt children. He drew much fire for sanctioning the showing of the controversial photo exhibition \"Ecce Homo\" inside Uppsala Cathedral, where photos recreated classical Christian motifs but in contexts relating to homosexuality.\n\nHammar's liberal positions on several theological issues made him controversial among more conservative Christians. In an interview with Kyrkans Tidning, the Church of Sweden national magazine, he was quoted as saying: \"\"You do not have to believe in anything particular to be a Christian. To say that you want to be part of it is enough. What kind of right do I have to question that? The definition frenzy only leads to exclusion\"\", the context of the statement being how the church could open its door and welcome religious seekers and people who do not feel welcome in the church. He has also on other occasions stated that he thinks that the Virgin Birth should be interpreted as a ”poetic statement” rather than a literal fact.\n\nHis views on homosexuality and controversial theological issues sometimes stirred emotions among other Christian denominations. For example, the Church of Sweden's rather new-founded ecumenical contacts with the Roman-Catholic Church and its old contacts with the Anglican Communion were strained for a while, but have since gone back to normal.\n\nHammar's theological position lies within a tradition of Christian mysticism and he has on several occasions expressed his gratitude to the writings of former U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld and his book \"Markings\", and also to the Swedish poet laureate Tomas Tranströmer.\n\nOn 25 August 2005 Hammar announced that he intended to step down from his post in the summer of 2006. He cited personal reasons, but declined to comment further.\n\nK. G. Hammar became a widower in 2007. He remarried in 2014, and has five adult children.\n\nAfter the title follows an unofficial translation into English.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2069581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069581", "title": "Television in Israel", "text": "Television in Israel\n\nTelevision in Israel refers to television broadcasting services in the State of Israel, inaugurated on March 24, 1966. Initially, there was one state-owned channel, operated jointly by the Israel Broadcasting Authority and the Israeli Educational Television. In 1986, a second state-regulated channel was launched. This channel became a state-regulated commercial channel in 1993. An additional commercial channel was introduced in 2002, followed by the introduction of three commercial niche channels: an Israeli Russian-speaking channel (in 2002), a channel of Israeli popular music (in 2003) and an Arabic-speaking channel (in 2012). Colour transmissions were introduced gradually around 1977 and 1979. Multichannel cable television service became available to subscribers gradually since 1989, although illegal cable TV stations were present in the big cities during the 1980s. Satellite-based multichannel service has been available since 2000.\n\nAlmost 75% of the population is subscribed to pay TV systems which are provided either by a cable service called \"HOT\", or by a satellite service called \"yes\".\nThe Israel Broadcasting Authority was closed down in May 2017 and replaced by the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation as the operator of the state-owned TV channels. Channel 2 has split into two different channels in November 2017, giving each of the two current operating commercial companies a channel of its own: Keshet 12, and Reshet 13.\n\nUpon its establishment in May 1948, Israel had one radio station, run directly by the government, which was a continuation of the British Mandate's Hebrew radio station. The first governments, headed by David Ben-Gurion, did not favor the establishment of TV stations. Nevertheless, the Israeli government discussed the idea of using television as an instructional and educational tool in 1952 and 1955. In 1961 the Israeli government asked UNESCO to offer its opinion, which was in favor of using television for educational purposes. In the early 1960s, television broadcasts from neighboring Egypt, Lebanon, and Cyprus gradually became available to Israelis through TV sets which were placed in public places, like cafés. Since they were mainly in Arabic, these broadcasts were popular among Israeli Arabs. This raised the government's concern about anti-Israel propaganda that might be included in them.\n\nWhen Levi Eshkol assumed power as prime minister in June 1963, he started to promote the establishment of an Israeli TV channel. In 1964, he invited a team of experts from the European Broadcasting Union to submit their recommendations. In 1965, the Israeli Broadcasting Authority was established in order to distant the government from the everyday management and editorial decisions of the state-owned radio station. The government also passed a resolution stating that this new body will start TV broadcasts within two years.\n\nTelevision in Israel was finally introduced on 24 March 1966, though not by the IBA, but rather by the Israeli Educational Television, which was funded by the Rothschild Foundation and acted as part of the Ministry of Education. The first transmissions were lessons to school students in various subjects, filmed in black and white, and intended to be received by 32 schools across the country. The Israeli Broadcasting Authority launched regular public transmissions on 2 May 1968, on the occasion of Israeli Independence Day.\n\nIsraeli television began operations when American and European stations were switching to full-scale colour transmissions, but Israel's state-controlled stations broadcast only in black and white. According to Arnon Zuckerman, head of IBA's television department from 1973 to March 1979, Israeli prime minister Golda Meir described colour television as \"artificial\" and unnecessary. Yair Lapid, son of Tommy Lapid, the IBA director general from April 1979 to March 1984, claimed the IBA had the equipment for filming and broadcasting in colour for nearly a decade before putting it into use, and the introduction of colour transmissions was halted due to political pressure.\n\nNewscasts and other regular productions were filmed using black and white cameras. However many special productions ordered from private Israeli studios (in particular Herzliya Studios) were filmed and taped in colour. Furthermore, Israeli television bought the rights to many American and British TV series and movies (broadcast with Hebrew-Arabic subtitles). The result was a mixture of colour and black and white broadcasts, which encouraged traders to import colour TV sets, especially as TV stations in neighbouring Jordan and Egypt started colour transmissions in 1974.\n\nThe Israeli government considered the import of color televisions as a frivolous luxury that would increase social gaps. Therefore, the government ordered IBA and IETV to erase the colour from colour-taped telecasts by erasing the \"burst phase\" signal. The \"damaged\" signal triggered the \"colour killer\" mechanism, installed in colour TV sets to prevent the appearance of incidental colour spots on the screen when black-and-white films are broadcast or when the reception is disturbed. This method was named \"mekhikon\" ( \"eraser\"), and soon after its introduction, special TV sets with an \"anti-mekhikon\" ( \"anti-eraser\") device were offered. This device reinstalled the burst phase signal according to several known standards. The client had to turn a switch until the pictures on the screen appeared in natural colours. According to a report in Yediot Aharonoth from January 1979 clients had to manipulate the switch every 15 minutes on average in normal conditions, or up to 10 times an hour when special problems occurred, in order to restore natural colours or if the picture suddenly turned black and white.\n\nBased on information from owners of electric appliance stores, the report estimated that 90% of those who bought colour TV sets also bought the \"anti-mekhikon\" device, whose price ranged between 2,500 and 4,000 Israeli lirot (the TV set itself cost 40-50 thousand lirot).\n\nThe Israeli government allowed colour transmissions by the IBA in November 1977 when IBA provided live color coverage of the historical visit of the Egyptian president, Anwar El Sadat, to Israel. This transmission was sent via satellite to stations around the world. In March 1979 the IBA hosted the annual Eurovision Song Contest, and once again sent the transmission live in colour to stations around the world.\n\nPublic pressure on the issue of colour transmissions mounted, and in 1981 IBA and IETV were allowed to film their own regular productions in colour. This process took more than two years and reached the last stretch on 16 February 1983 when the main daily newscast was broadcast in colour for the first time. According to Lapid's book, this first colour newscast was prepared secretly by some \"enthusiastic workers\" of IBA, in order to avoid industrial actions by the technicians' trade union, who demanded higher salaries for operating colour equipment. Lapid also mentions that the \"anti-mekhikon\" system cost IBA 180 million Israeli lira yearly (approximately 64 million Israeli new shekels in 2011 prices). The IBA stopped filming in black and white on 10 May 1983.\n\nIn 1978 the Israeli government appointed a special committee to explore the establishment of a second channel that would not be under the IBA supervision and would be financed by advertising, however the idea of commercial television was rejected by some parties in the ruling coalition. On 7 October 1986, Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, the then Israeli Minister of Communications ordered the beginning of \"experimental transmissions\" on a second channel, claiming that unless these transmissions had started, the frequencies would have been used by TV networks in neighbouring countries. First transmissions were aired on UHF channel 21 from Mount Eitanim transmission tower situated on the hills west of Jerusalem. These transmissions, which initially included 2–3 hours of video clips every evening and broadcast from a private TV studio in Jerusalem, expanded gradually to include a full program lineup. At this stage the IBA was legally responsible for the channel, but in fact it saw it as an unexpected competition, tried to prevent its inauguration, and was reluctant to take responsibility for its broadcasts. In 1986 the Knesset started discussing the law forming the Second Israeli Broadcasting Authority, which was finally approved in 1990. This new body took responsibility for the second channel from this year onwards. From 1990 to 1993 the Second Broadcasting Authority reviewed bids from commercial companies to establish the regular commercial broadcasts of the second channel, which started on 4 November 1993. The second channel was officially handed to three concessionaires, starting the first commercial broadcasts in Israel, with IETV as the fourth broadcaster which was entitled, by law, for additional hours on this channel as a commercial entity.\n\nPirated television broadcasts via cables became very popular in the major cities of Israel during the late 80s. These were usually local cable television stations broadcasting illegally from private houses to subscribers, mainly films released on video tapes. These local stations vanished with the introduction of regulated cable television in 1989. By mid-1994, some 720,000 Israeli households were hooked up to cable television.\n\nSatellite television was introduced to Israel in 2000.\n\nGenerally speaking, most television distribution channels in Israel utilize the European Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) family of standards.\n\nIn August 2009, Israel launched digital terrestrial broadcasts with the intention to phase out the analogue broadcast. Israel shut down analogue television services on 13 June 2011; the first nation in the Middle East to abandon analogue over-the-air broadcasting. In the early stage there was only single mux broadcast in SFN with five channels and later on a sixth TV channel was added and also a selection of public and regional radio stations. By mid-2017 an additional mux was introduced with five new TV channels in DVB-T2 standard, including IPBC's Hebrew channel \"Kan 11\" channel in HD.\n\nIsraeli television broadcasts mainly in Hebrew and English. While Hebrew is the common language of communication, numerous shows and series of different genres are bought from English-speaking countries. Unless the target audience is preschool children, subtitling in Hebrew is preferred over dubbing, not only for economic considerations. Subtitling is often bilingual, the secondary language being either Arabic or Russian. The state-owned Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) had an Arabic department which broadcasts news, talk shows, educational programs for children and Egyptian films on IBA's Channel 33. From May 15, 2017, the Arabic channel is operated by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation and is called Makan 33. IBA's English department broadcast a daily locally produced newscast. Commercial channels are obligated to broadcast a portion of their programs in Arabic and Russian, or alternatively translate programs into these languages. There is also a legal obligation on all channels to translate some of their newscasts into the Israeli Sign Language.\n\nIn 2002, an Israeli Russian-speaking commercial channel was launched, named Israel Plus. A similar Arabic-speaking channel started broadcasting in March 2012, after several attempts to establish it earlier failed The first bid for the establishment of this channel was published in 1995, but canceled for formal legal problems. In January 2003, a new bid was published, but the winning company failed to fulfill its financial obligations. A final modified bid was published on 14 April 2010, for which eight companies competed. The Hala TV Company was selected in September 2011.\n\n\n\nPrime-time viewing shares, January–June 2012:\n\n"}

{"id": "2069591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069591", "title": "Code (semiotics)", "text": "Code (semiotics)\n\nIn semiotics, a code is a set of conventions or sub-codes currently in use to communicate meaning. The most common is one's spoken language, but the term can also be used to refer to any narrative form: consider the color scheme of an image (e.g. red for danger), or the rules of a board game (e.g. the military signifiers in chess).\n\nFerdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) emphasised that signs only acquire meaning and value when they are interpreted in relation to each other. He believed that the relationship between the signifier and the signified was arbitrary. Hence, interpreting signs requires familiarity with the sets of conventions or codes currently in use to communicate meaning.\n\nRoman Jakobson (1896–1982) elaborated the idea that the production and interpretation of texts depends on the existence of codes or conventions for communication. Since the meaning of a sign depends on the code within which it is situated, codes provide a framework within which signs make sense (see Semiosis).\n\nTo that extent, codes represent a broad interpretative framework used by both addressers and their addressees to encode and decode the messages. Self-evidently, the most effective communications will result when both creator and interpreter use exactly the same code. Since signs may have many levels of meaning from the denotational to the connotational, the addresser's strategy is to select and combine the signs in ways that limit the range of possible meanings likely to be generated when the message is interpreted. This will be achieved by including metalingual contextual clues, e.g. the nature of the medium, the modality of the medium, the style, e.g. academic, literary, genre fiction, etc., and references to, or invocations of, other codes, e.g. a reader may initially interpret a set of signifiers as a literal representation, but clues may indicate a transformation into a metaphorical or allegorical interpretation diachronically. Distinctions of class or memberships of groups will be determined by the social identity each individual constructs through the way the language is spoken (i.e. with an accent or as a dialect) or written (i.e. in sentences or in SMS format), the place of residence (see Americanisms), the nature of any employment undertaken, the style of dress, and nonverbal behaviour (e.g. through differentiating customs as to the extent of private space, whether and where people may touch or stare at each other, etc.). The process of socialisation is learning to understand the prevailing codes and then deciding which to apply at any given time, i.e. acknowledging that there is sometimes an ideological quality to the coding system, determining levels of social acceptability, reflecting current attitudes and beliefs. This includes regulatory codes that are intended to control behaviour and the use of some signifying codes. The human body is a means of using presentational codes through facial expressions, gestures, and dress. So words spoken may change their connotation to unacceptable if accompanied by inappropriate nonverbal signs.\nThe other code forms rely upon knowledge held by, and the interests of, the addressees. Specialised denotational codes may provide a more objective and impersonal form of language for mathematical, philosophical, and scientific texts. Hence, for example, the ability to read this text depends upon a more specialised form of vocabulary and different skills to those required to read a genre text detailing the investigations of a detective or the adventures of a secret agent. There are also specialised connotational and ideological codes to reflect particular social, political, moral, and aesthetic values. Musical and iconic codes would be relevant as between a work by Arnold Schoenberg and a piece of bubblegum pop, and a painting by Rembrandt and a comic book by Frank Miller, etc. Each medium has its own specialised codes and, by making them more explicit, semiotics is attempting to explain the practices and conventions have appeared in each form and to understand how meaning is being communicated. In return, this assists addressers to improve their techniques, no matter what their functional needs, e.g. as politicians, journalists, advertisers, creative artists, etc. Indeed, awareness leads to an intentional blending of codes for effect, e.g. an advertiser may produce a more effective campaign with a slogan, images and a jingle using lexical, social gestural, and musical codes.\nIn communication research and media research, the way receivers act towards the message and the way it is encoded becomes relevant, and generates different reactions: \n\n\n"}

The band is also considered the first serious music project of now renowned singer Björk Guðmundsdóttir. The band was reformed in 2015 by the original members, without Björk.\n\nIn 1979 Björk was singing in a band called Exodus with guitarists Ásgeir Sæmundsson and Þorvaldur Bjarni Þorvaldsson, bassist Skúli Sverrisson, and drummer Oddur F. Sigurbjörnsson. In 1980 she left the band with Oddur and joined bassist Jakob Smári Magnússon and guitarist Eyjólfur Jóhannsson to form a band called Jam-80 because they were meant to play for just one gig, although they continued playing for a while.\n\nThey performed a mixture of pop and punk music and never released any official record, but recorded a cassette demo during a gig at Hólabrekkuskóli which contained the following tracks: two songs by Janis Ian: “Run too Fast, Fly too High” and “The Other Side of the Sun”; two songs by Deep Purple: “Highball Shooter” and “Demon’s Eye”; other tracks were “13–16” by Utangarðsmenn, Jethro Tull's arrangement of J.S. Bach's Boureé, “Funky Town”, and two instrumental songs (untitled). This band came to an end when decided to create a punk band with more serious music. That is how Tappi Tíkarrass came into being by September 1981 with vocalist Eyþór Arnalds, who was replaced a few months later by Björk and a year later, Oddur was replaced in drums by Guðmundur Þór Gunnarsson.\n\nThe name Tappi Tíkarrass, which in Icelandic means “Cork the Bitch’s Ass” was given after Jakob’s father claimed that the band’s music “fitted like a cork in a bitch’s ass”. Tappi Tíkarrass combined elements of punk and pop music to create an exotic post punk with references to Siouxsie and the Banshees and the first stage of The Cure.\n\nThey started to record in August 1982 and released an EP titled \"Bitið fast í vitið\" which went out through label Spor. This 12” vinyl was formed of 5 tracks performed by Björk, who replaced the original vocals by Eyþór. The only song in English was “London”.\n\nThey followed up in 1983 with the full-length \"Miranda\", released by Gramm.\n\nAfter reforming without Björk, the group released a self-titled full-length in December 2017, on their own self-titled label.\n\nTappi Tíkarrass appeared on \"Rokk í Reykjavík\", a TV documentary directed by Friðrik Þór Friðriksson. Tappi Tíkarrass was one of the 19 bands featured in the film and collaborated with two songs: “Hrollur” and “Dúkkulísur”, both of them sung by Björk and Eyþór with Oddur replacing Guðmundur in drums. Björk became the film's visual symbol and its cover star. The movie is considered classic in Iceland and corresponding period in Icelandic music is now known as the ‘Rokk í Reykjavík’-era.\n\nIn 1983 they appeared on \"Nýtt Líf\", a comedy directed by Þráinn Bertelsson. The film was shot in the Westman Islands and Tappi Tíkarrass played on stage two songs “Sperglar” and “Kukl” (better known as “Seiður”), under the supervision of Megas.\n\nDespite the rising interest in this band as Björk developed into an international music artist, the discography of Tappi Tíkarrass has never been reissued and all the original releases are widely unavailable. The band has appeared only in two Icelandic compilations, \"Satt 3\" which was released in 1984 and featured two live B-sides: “Sperglar” and “Seiður”. Finally, by 1998 record label Spor released \"Nælur\", another compilation which contained the songs “Iltí Ební” and “London”, both of them taken from \"Bitið fast í vitið\".\n\nBy July 1983 the band split up when Björk joined Purrkur Pillnikk’s singer Einar Örn Benediktsson, Þeyr’s guitarist Guðlaugur Kristinn Óttarsson and drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson, with Medúsa’s keyboardist Einar Arnaldur Melax, and finally Birgir Mogensen bassist from Spilafífl. Together they formed a goth-oriented and more experimental band called KUKL.\n\nJakob Magnússon and Guðmundur joined Bubbi Morthens to play in Das Kapital until 1985, then Jakob followed up with Bubbi & MX-21, and worked as a session player for several artists. In 2003 he released his first solo album, \"Bassajól\". After playing in Das Kapital, Guðmundur withdrew from the music scene.<br>\nAfter leaving the band, Eyþór Arnalds studied cello and continued with the band Todmobile and later joined singer Móa Julíusdóttir to form a band called Bong which achieved relative success in Iceland and England. He has released a few solo albums and then collaborated with Móa’s debut album \"Universal\" in 1998 and has worked in the Icelandic music industry as sound engineer. More recently, he got involved in politics, getting elected as mayor in the town of Árborg. Eyjólfur Jóhannsson continued playing with bands like Dá, The Wunderfoolzs, and in 2002 joined S.S.Sól. Oddur joined a heavy metal band called Foringjarnir, and he became an electrician. More recently he followed up with another band called Santiago, releasing an album in 2002.\n\nThe last performance of Tappi Tíkarrass took place in 1987 when the band reunited to play at a night club called \"Safari\".\n\nTappi Tíkarrass had numerous gigs throughout Iceland when originally formed, and visited UK in spring 1983 (below are listed some of the known performances). After a 30-year hiatus, the band performed (without Björk) at Secret Solstice 2017 in Iceland, and then later the same year at Iceland Airwaves 2017.\n\nEP:\nAlbum:\n\nFeaturing:\n\nFilms:\n\n\n\nNote: This article features Icelandic characters.

Her debut album, also titled \"When You Lie Next to Me\", was released the same year on BNA Records, and in 2003, Coffey won the Top New Female Vocalist award from the Academy of Country Music. She was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nKellie Coffey was born April 22, 1971 in Moore, Oklahoma. She became a regular singer after performing on the Oklahoma Opry at age nine, graduated from Westmoore High School in Moore in 1989, and participated in various musicals while attending the University of Oklahoma. Later on, she moved to Los Angeles, California, where she lived in a friend's apartment. At the same time, she sang demos, as well as music used by The Walt Disney Company and the television show \"Walker, Texas Ranger\". She also sang backing vocals for Barbra Streisand at a Las Vegas show.\n\nAfter a showcase at a Los Angeles restaurant, Coffey was signed to a publishing contract with Warner/Chappell Music. Later, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where she auditioned for recording contracts. BNA Records, a sister label of RCA Records, signed her in 2001.\n\nCoffey released her debut single \"When You Lie Next to Me\" in December 2001. The song spent 33 weeks on the \"Billboard\" country singles charts, reaching a peak of number 8. It was the title track to her Dann Huff-produced debut album \"When You Lie Next to Me\". She co-wrote seven of the album's 11 songs, including all three of its singles. Following the title track were \"At the End of the Day\" at number 18 and \"Whatever It Takes\" at number 44.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic rated the album three stars out of five, describing Coffey as \"a more approachable Faith Hill— her polished country-pop is every bit as urbane, yet it doesn't feel as glamorous.\" Country Standard Time reviewer Jeffrey B.

{"id": "2069641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069641", "title": "Violet Parr", "text": "Violet Parr\n\nViolet Parr is a fictional character who appears in Pixar's computer animated superhero film \"The Incredibles\" (2004) and its sequel \"Incredibles 2\" (2018). The eldest child of Bob and Helen Parr (Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl), Violet is born with the superhuman ability to render herself invisible, as well as generate force fields. Voiced by Sarah Vowell, Violet is a shy junior high school student who longs to fit in among her peers, a task she believes is hindered by her superpowers. Throughout the course of the films, Violet gradually matures and becomes more confident in herself as both a young woman and superhero.\n\nCreated by screenwriter and director Brad Bird, Bird decided to grant Violet the ability to turn invisible because he felt that this specific superpower mirrors some of the challenges that teenage girls experience while growing up, namely insecurity and defensiveness. Bird cast Vowell as Violet upon listening to her contribute a real-life story about her father to the radio program \"This American Life\", with Violet ultimately becoming Vowell's first voice-acting role. Vowell identified with the character's shy, sarcastic nature, in addition to observing similarities between Violet's relationship with Bob and her relationship with her own father.\n\nNew computer technology was developed to animate Violet's long black hair, which animators identified as the most difficult component of \"The Incredibles\" since such a large quantity of hair had never been featured in a computer-animated film before. The character's hair serves as an important aspect of Violet's character development, which demonstrates her steady increase in self-confidence as she gradually ceases to hide her face behind it.\n\nReception towards Violet has been positive, with film critics commending her character development and relatability, as well as Vowell's vocal performance. Critics have also heavily compared Violet to the comic book superheroine the Invisible Woman, whose superpowers she shares. The character's likeness has since been used in several tie-in media and merchandise associated with the films, including toys, books and video game adaptations.\n\nScreenwriter and director Brad Bird conceived Violet as \"a teenage girl who just wants to be invisible\". In early drafts of the screenplay, Violet was depicted as an infant as opposed to a teenager, since parents Bob and Helen Parr were originally intended to be introduced as retired superheroes who had just begun to attempt to live normal lives much earlier during the film. Violet is voiced by American author and actress Sarah Vowell, who related that she was offered the role unexpectedly. While beginning to cast the film's main characters, Bird had been listening to the National Public Radio program \"This American Life\", to which Vowell is a frequent contributor. During one of Vowell's regular appearances on the show, Bird heard her contribute an anecdote about a cannon she had helped her father, a gunsmith, build. Bird wanted to cast Vowell based on her description of the event, deciding that she was \"perfect\" for the role, which he immediately called to offer her. Vowell had already earned a reputation for declining several voice acting jobs prior to \"The Incredibles\", to the point at which her agent warned Bird not to waste his time. However, Vowell states that she simply avoided pursuing voice roles in general because she was content being a writer and found few animated projects particularly interesting prior to \"The Incredibles\".\nThe animators animated a rough test sequence to some of Vowell's dialogue from the radio segment about her father's cannon, in which Violet is depicted being startled by a gun that repeatedly fires in her hands. Despite experiencing some hesitation due to having never voiced an animated character before, Vowell accepted the role after receiving an e-mail from the film's producer, agreeing to participate in \"The Incredibles\" because she believes that Pixar is consistently \"the best at what they do\", comparing the offer to politician Nelson Mandela \"asking for your help to fight racism\". She had also been a long-time fan of Bird's work as a filmmaker. Vowell ultimately accepted the role based on a sole image she had been sent of the character: a drawing of Violet surrounded by her schoolmates, all of whom appear to be happy and outgoing apart from Violet herself, who is instead hunched over and hiding behind her hair. Vowell concluded, \"I can be that kid. I was that kid. I love that archetype of the morose, shy, smart-alecky teenage girl.\"\n\nIndieWire contributor Oliver Lyttelton believes that Vowell was the most unexpected of Bird's casting decisions. Vowell has said that, like Violet, she herself \"is a little smart-alecky and also has a weird dad with a strange hobby\", finding the unique dynamic between Violet and Bob similar to her relationship with her own father, particularly the combination of affection, sarcasm and confusion that both her and her character feel towards their respective parents. Vowell expounded that she tends to resemble \"a wise guy\" in conversation with her father and believes that her tone of voice possibly influenced Bird's decision to cast her as a teenager. Vowell admitted that she shares Violet's \"inability to stop pushing people's buttons\", citing their tendency to voice their opinions about any given topic and gift for making various situations awkward as similarities.\n\nVowell found the recording process somewhat similar to working in radio, apart from the fact that the process required more standing, gesturing and working closely with a director. The film also required Vowell to deviate from her typically underplayed, deadpan delivery due to animation being broader in tone and demanding more \"exclamation\", identifying the process as more similar to stage than film acting because, like the former, \"animation ... require[s] more and bigger things.\" She revealed that voicing a teenage girl involved more acting than she had been expecting since she was \"raised to be a stoic person.\" For the scene in which Violet and her family's plane crashes into the ocean, Vowell drank from a water bottle while gurgling and gulping to simulate the sound of a person drowning. Despite using a towel as a bib, Vowell still got considerably wet during the process. Vowell found the process of producing non-verbal sounds such as laughing, yawning and screaming on cue to be the most difficult component of the job, a task that working in radio had hardly prepared her for. During her first recording session, the actress struggled to sound as though she had just been hurt and thus asked Bird to hit her arm to help her replicate the sound of being punched. Vowell recorded her character's screams closer towards the end of filming in order to preserve her voice, calling the process \"fun\" and claiming, \"I don't think I had screamed ... for about 20 years\" at that point.\n\nVowell found the opportunity to voice a superheroine \"thrilling\" because she considers herself to be \"more of a walking Woody Allen movie\" in real life due to her fears of driving and swimming, joking that it is \"fun to listen to my voice do things [in film] that ... it would never get to do.\" Vowell also admitted that she tends to sound \"cartoonish\" and young for her age, elaborating that voicing Violet \"lead[s] into some of my insecurities ... when you worry you sound like a cartoon and then someone sends me a message [asking] do I want to be in an animated movie … I guess I am who I am.\" Bird maintains that Vowell \"knocked it out of the park\" with her performance, although Vowell claims that her acting required a lot of additional direction due to being less experienced, believing that Bird was drawn to \"the extra challenge of an unformed performer.\" Producer Nicole Paradis Grindle agreed that Vowell \"genuinely thinks the way Brad [Bird] wants Violet to think\", which contribute to her deliveries being \"spot-on\". Despite her success, Vowell maintains that she is not an actress, describing herself as merely \"a writer moonlighting\" as an actress for \"The Incredibles\" and insisting that she would be \"mortified\" if she were required to act in the presence of anyone apart from Bird, whose directing she trusts greatly, explaining, \"I trust that he’ll be able to find something in me or he’ll be able to inspire something in me, and he’ll also be able to find the take that is the best one.\"\n\nVowell stars in a documentary about her work in the film, \"Vowellet: An Essay by Sarah Vowell\", which is included as a bonus feature on \"The Incredibles\"' 2004 DVD release. In the \"video essay\", Vowell discusses the various differences between voicing a superhero and becoming an action figure while she was writing about presidential assassinations, contrasting the two distinct careers. The animators also animated Violet to some of Vowell's dialogue from the documentary. Bird, who voices costume designer Edna Mode, was the only other actor Vowell recorded with while working on both films. The director would sometimes temporarily provide the voices of other characters for Vowell to act opposite of, such as Elastigirl in lieu of actress Holly Hunter. For \"Incredibles 2\", Vowell had not been allowed to read to entire script while recording her dialogue, having only been allowed to preview small excerpts in which Violet is speaking or having conversations with other characters. Until watching the film for the first time, Vowell had been under the impression that \"Incredibles 2\" would mostly be about Violet's anger at her father until experiencing the film's other storylines and characters. Despite 14 years separating the releases of the first and second films, Vowell did not find resuming the role to be difficult, identifying Violet as a character to whom she feels \"closely tied\", having played her for approximately one-third of her life. Syfy Wire's Heather Mason observed that Vowell shares her dry sense of humor with Violet. To-date, the \"Incredibles\" films remain Vowell's only animated film roles.\n\nBird had always been more interested in developing the personalities of the film's main characters than their superpowers. When it came time to determine the Parr family's powers, Bird decided to draw inspiration from the roles of typical nuclear family members, basing both their superpowers and personalities on these traditional archetypes. Describing Violet as \"a typical teenager ... not comfortable in her own skin\" who resides \"in that rocky place between being a kid and an adult\", Bird felt that invisibility would be the most suitable power for the Parr family's only daughter. Describing her as a young woman who would much prefer if other people avoided looking at her, Bird elaborated that some teenage girls are prone to feeling insecure and defensive, and thus gave her the abilities to become invisible and create protective shields. According to Vowell, Violet's superpowers of invisibility and force fields are, much like the rest of her family, \"psychologically representational of who she is\"; a teenage girl who longs to remain hidden and protected; the actress described her as a young woman \"trapped between childhood and maturity, between self-confidence and insecurity\" like many teenagers. Bird sought to balance the adventurous and \"ordinary\" components of the family's lives, explaining that audiences would appreciate and relate to moments when Violet uses her powers in the event that she feels humiliated. In terms of music, composer Michael Giacchino developed a theme for Violet that he described as \"coy and mysterious\".\n\nAlthough the films are set roughly during the 1950s and 1960s, shading art director Bryn Imagire opted to incorporate a more modern style into Violet's wardrobe, feeling that the hourglass silhouette, poofy skirts and tight shirts young women typically wore during this time period were not as suitable for the character due to her shy, withdrawn personality and hairstyle. Although the animators admitted to using mid-century fashion \"as a jumping-off point\", they deliberately designed Violet's clothes to be more baggy in appearance with a \"very desaturated\" color scheme, incorporating a variety of cut-off jeans, sneakers and sweaters into her attire to compliment her rebellious personality. Furthermore, the majority of the character's clothing during the first film are variations of the color purple, alluding to her name. Violet was costumed in a pink shirt towards the end of the film in order to demonstrate that she is now \"much more open– sort of like she’s blossoming as a teenager.\" Imagire identified the character as \"the perfect example of where we didn’t go mid-century; we went modern with her\" instead. For the sequel, the increasing complexity of Violet's force fields required the animators to create new effects; although they remain visually similar to the first film, Violet \"is able to do more with her force fields, so we had to figure out how that changes the look of her force fields,\" including sound effects and static as they interact with other objects, according to effects supervisor Bill Watral.\n\n\"The Incredibles\" required the use of computer technology that was particularly advanced for its time, some of which computers had not yet been \"taught\". Computers were used to simulate hair movement and determine where hair was intended to be placed on the film's respective characters. Described as a new and time-consuming process at the time, new programs and approaches were developed and implemented to assist the animators in animating Violet's long black hair. Since organic materials are still considered to be among the most challenging objects to animate in computer animation, Violet's hair proved to be the most difficult subject for the animators to master. Although scale models of Violet and the film's major characters were first sculpted in clay by artist Kent Melton, the animators initially struggled to replicate Melton's very detailed interpretation of Violet's hair. According to hair and cloth simulation supervisor Mark Henne, Violet's hair remained an \"unsolved research project\" for much of the film's production due to its type and length, which had never been featured in a computer animated film prior to \"The Incredibles\".\n\nFor the majority of the film's production, Violet's character model was entirely bald. Producer John Walker frequently pleaded with the animators to give the character some form of hair, to which they would respond, \"the hair is still theoretical\"; it remained as such until significantly late into completion. Vowell recalled seeing only a bald iteration of her character for most of her recording process. Technical director Rick Sayre explained that the challenges revolving around Violet's hair were rooted in the fact that she has \"no fixed hair style\"; her hair constantly adopts new shapes and forms as it interacts with other objects, including other strands of her own hair, as well as her own body. Despite its challenges, the filmmakers resisted temptation to give the character a shorter, more manageable hairstyle, insisting on keeping Violet's hair long because its length plays an integral role in her story arc; Violet \"is all about the fact that she hides behind her long hair ... It’s such a crucial part of the character that we had to get it right.\" Violet is also the only member of her family to have black hair; her father, mother and younger brother each have blond, brown and blond hair, respectively. Bird explained that Violet's hair color is the result of a recessive gene.\n\nViolet's hair required animators a total of six months to fully render. Henne and the animators sculpted five different hairstyles for the character to be used during various moments in the film, which were modified and adjusted accordingly to suit different circumstances and environmental conditions such as rain, wind and the zero-gravity effects of her own force fields. Ultimately, Violet's hair became one of the film's greatest accomplishments, which Sayre has since deemed \"a significant advance in showing hair move in a believable manner while retaining its stylistic look ... no one had ever animated this kind of hair before for a CG film.\" The difficulty surrounding Violet's hair ultimately influenced Mirage's hairstyle, which was originally quite long until Sayre begged the filmmakers to adopt it into a shorter and \"cooler\" variation due to the amount of time and effort that had already been spent on creating Violet's hair. Due to the technological advancements that computer animation has undergone since the original film was released, for the sequel animators were able to revisit and replicate Melton's more intricate, original design for Violet's hair, which \"flows much more freely\" in \"Incredibles 2\". Despite these achievements, however, simulation supervisor Tiffany Erickson Klohn admitted that animating the character's hair remained challenging due to its requirement to be \"silky and straight\" but be subject to \"some breakup\" during action-oriented sequences, combined with the fact that Violet has a larger head despite being small in frame, meaning that \"there's very little for her hair to rest on\" when she moves. According to character art director Matt Nolte, the filmmakers agreed that Violet's hair would be worn back entirely for the sequel to emphasize \"that she's not scared anymore.\"\n\nOriginally depicted as a shy, timid and socially withdrawn girl, Violet finds it difficult to fit in among her peers and thus prefers to remain unnoticed. According to Alissa Wilkinson of \"Rolling Stone\", the character's longing \"to hide is familiar to virtually anyone who's ever been an awkward\" teenager. Film critic Roger Ebert observed that the superhero life occasionally proves to be \"too much\" for Violet; she longs to be normal like her peers despite the fact that she is anything but, originally insisting that youngest brother Jack-Jack is the only \"normal\" member of her family since the infant had yet to exhibit signs of having superpowers. She has a tendency to hide behind her long black hair, which initially conceals most of her face for much of the film. She wears dark colors, representing the fact that she can be a particularly moody character. At times her appearance and dark-colored wardrobe have been described as \"goth\"; Mark Halverson of \"Sacramento News & Review\" wrote that \"Violet hides behind a goth persona when not using her invisibility or force field to repel human contact.\" A writer for IGN likened the way in which Violet's hair drapes across her face to actress Veronica Lake. However, she grows more confident in both herself and her abilities as the film progresses, eventually emerging from behind her hair, using a headband to wear her it back and adopting a more colorful wardrobe. Grindle explained that the character successfully \"turned a corner at the end of the first movie\" to the point of which she is finally able to ask her crush on a date, which she partially attributes to her beginning to believe in herself as a result of fighting crime alongside her family. Violet is 14 years-old, weighs approximately 90 pounds and is 4’6 tall.\n\nAccording to the character's official character description in press releases for \"Incredibles 2\", Violet is socially awkward, outspoken, sarcastic, intelligent and reserved, while Pixar's website describes her as \"a typical shy, insecure teenage girl stuck at the crossroads between child and woman.\" \"Maiden USA: Girl Icons Come of Age\" author Kathleen Sweeney dubbed the character a \"shrinking violet\" who has a tendency to mumble and come off as angry. Similarly describing her as a shrinking violet, ReelViews' James Berardinelli observed that Violet \"has entered that gawky stage of life when her body becomes uncomfortable to inhabit.\" Identifying her as an \"oral character\", John Kundert-Gibbs, author of \"Action!: Acting Lessons for CG Animators\", Violet's main arc revolves around transitioning \"from being invisible to visible to others.\" According to Daphne Carr, author of N\"ine Inch Nails' Pretty Hate Machine\", Violet adheres to \"the archetype of the introverted, introspective artist-type kid.\" Oliver Lyttelton of IndieWire believes that Violet has more in common with actress Thora Birch's character Enid in the film \"Ghost World\" (2001) than most teenage girls. Observing that Bird approached the character designs in a manner that is \"less cute\" and more edgy than previous Pixar characters, Jeff Otto of IGN likened Violet to the goth teenager Lydia Deetz (Winona Ryder) from the film \"Beetlejuice\" (1988).\n\nIn \"Incredibles 2\", female characters contribute a more central role to the plot, with Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" observing that Violet has begun \"to spread her wings\". However, she remains an awkward teenage girl \"with the power to make herself invisible (although not, sadly, to make the boy she has a crush on really see her)\", according to \"Slate\"'s Sam Adams, with the film exploring her \"adolescent, boy-crazed sanity\" and first broken heart, to which she reacts by consuming ice cream and throwing her clothes. At times, Violet can be so concerned with her own struggles that she fails to notice some of the situations that are affecting the rest of her family, although she maintains the importance of family. Vowell observed that Violet's temper is explored much further in \"Incredibles 2\", in which she cries and yells out of annoyance and passion, summarizing the character as \"a hormonal teenager.\" The actress believes that her character \"can be hilarious\" at times, \"but her humor has some bite to it ... She has a tendency to comment a little too truthfully about any given scenario ... For better or worse, if she thinks it, she says it\", describing Violet as incapable of \"edit[ing] uncomfortable thoughts.\" According to Syfy Wire's Heather Mason, Violet's role in the sequel is to \"break the tension and bring the superheroes back to reality\" by \"say[ing] what they are all thinking.\"\n\nMuch like her brother, she often chafes against her mother's insistence that her family refrain from using their powers in an attempt to live like \"normal\" humans. At the same time, however, Violet and Dash are opposites in the sense that while Violet initially dislikes having superpowers, Dash, who possesses superhuman speed, is \"in love\" with his own abilities, thus the siblings constantly bicker about their differences.\n\nViolet is born with the superhuman abilities to render herself invisible and create force fields, the latter of which she is still attempting to master at the beginning of \"The Incredibles\". Her superpowers mirror the personality of an awkward teenager who dislikes attention and would rather avoid being looked at, as well as her insulated, protective nature. According to \"The New York Times\" film critic A. O. Scott, Violet's powers \"serve mainly as metaphors for her shyness and disconnection.\" Several journalists agree that Violet's abilities resemble the desires of most teenage girls. Vowell herself explained that her character's powers \"reflect a female teen's occasional desires to protect herself, block out the world and avoid scrutiny or surveillance.\" Violet uses her powers both in battle and to hide during uncomfortable situations, such as when she encounters Tony Rydinger, a schoolmate on whom she harbors a crush. This behavior establishes the character as a social outcast. \"Las Vegas Weekly\"'s Josh Bell identified Violet's invisibility as \"the physical manifestation of the effects of peer pressure.\"\n\n\"The Incredibles\" follows Violet as she learns to control her powers. Violet's low self-esteem manifests in the use of her superpowers to the point at which she resents having them, as demonstrated when she struggles to create a force field large enough to shield her family's jet from missiles at her mother's insistence. Kundert-Gibbs attributes Violet's ineptitude to lack of energy, which the author believes is also reflected in her straight, flat hair and slouching posture. However, Sweeney argues that Violet's inability to suddenly summon a force field of such magnitude is due to the fact that she is still unaccustomed to her powers, the use of which she had long been denied prior. After rescuing herself and her children, Helen apologizes to Violet for pressuring her to perform such a large feat, but at the same time warns Violet that they can no longer afford to doubt their abilities, assuring her daughter that she has hidden potential and \"When the time comes you'll know what to do. It's in your blood.\" IGN identified Helen's speech as female empowering, while Vowell cited the scene as a \"dramatic\" moment in which Violet dons her mask and truly \"becomes a hero\" for the first time, elaborating that the character evolves significantly \"in terms of really discovering ... and developing her powers\". Violet eventually learns to embrace her abilities. According to Sweeney, Violet transforms from a shrinking violet into \"Ultra-Violet\" by the end of the film, while Mic's Kevin O'Keeffe wrote that Violet uses \"invisibility while growing out of her own wallflower sensibility.\" \"Salon\" film critic Stephanie Zacharek opined that Violet slowly \"discovers that, when she really tries, she can build a force-field bubble that protects her whole family\". Tor.com's Mari Ness believes that Violet's gradual acceptance of her powers reinforces that \"happiness comes only after people embrace the extraordinary\". Vowell observed that by the sequel, Violet has consequently become skilled and confident to the point at which she starts enjoying her powers, \"so as the new film starts, she wants more. She wants to use her powers. She wants to be out there.\" Violet ultimately grows incapable of resisting the temptation to fight crime alongside her family.\n\nViolet can use her power of invisibility to render herself either wholly or partially invisible at will. Able to turn invisible rather quickly, the \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\"'s Mike Ward joked that the character s capable of disappearing faster than the short-lived 2004 presidential campaign of politician John Kerry. Edna designs a super suit for Violet that automatically turns invisible whenever she does. Violet's force fields consist of psychic energy, as they are created using her mind. Her fields sometimes demonstrate an anti-gravitational effect on the objects they surround, and can be used to deflect heavy oncoming artillery. Typically spherical, she can use them to surround both herself and anyone she is willing to protect. Improving her abilities over the course of the films, Violet becomes skilled to the point at which she can perform significantly more feats with her fields, capable of manipulating them to create various effects. Wilkinson believes that Violet is the most talented member of her family. Hypable contributor Aaron Locke agreed that Violet \"feels like the Super with the most potential\", particularly in \"Incredibles 2\". However, a particularly heavy, blunt force can potentially cause the wall of her shield to collide with her upon impact and dissipate, leaving her vulnerable to attacks. According to \"Ottawa Life Magazine\", Violet uses her force fields more often than her invisibility, although both powers have proven useful; in the first film, she uses both powers to battle hovercrafts and Syndrome's robot. Additionally, Violet has also been identified as highly intellectual.\n\nViolet's superpowers are very similar to those of the Invisible Woman (Susan Storm-Richards), a Marvel Comics superheroine and founding member of the superhero team the Fantastic Four. Fans of the film quickly identified similarities between the two characters when the first film was released in 2004. Contributing to IGN, comic book historian Peter Sanderson identified Violet's powers as \"The real giveaway of the F. F.'s influence on \"The Incredibles\"\". Similar to classic Marvel superheroes, the character is under the impression that her powers make her different from most people, and considers herself to be an outsider as a result of this. According to Eric Lichtenfeld, author of \"Action Speaks Louder: Violence, Spectacle, and the American Action Movie\", the character has also demonstrated the ability to manipulate the energy produced by her force fields, much like the comic book superheroine.\n\nViolet debuted in \"The Incredibles\" (2004) as the first-born child and only daughter of Bob and Helen Parr, a pair of retired superheroes known to the world as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl. The character has two younger brothers: Dash and Jack-Jack. A junior high school student with the superhuman abilities to turn invisible and create force fields, Violet is shy and insecure, and would much rather be a \"normal\" teenager, finding it difficult to fit in among her peers. Helen resumes superhero work in search of Bob, and Violet stows away with Dash onto the jet that their mother is piloting towards Syndrome's private island. When the jet is attacked by Syndrome's missiles, Violet fails to create a force field large enough to protect its passengers at her mother's insistence; the plane is downed and the family becomes stranded on Syndrome's island. Helen leaves Violet and Dash hidden in a cave, encouraging Violet to use her powers whenever necessary. Violet and Dash are eventually pursued by Syndrome's henchmen, forcing her to use her powers to defend herself and her brother for the first time; she begins to realize her full potential while striving to master her abilities, which she had been largely suppressing prior. Violet is instrumental in helping her family escape Syndrome's lair, using a force field to interfere with the electromagnetic fields that are imprisoning them, before returning to Metroville where she teams up with her family to defeat Syndrome's robot. Once Jack-Jack is rescued from Syndrome, Violet uses a force field to protect her family from the debris falling from Syndrome's destroyed jet. At Dash's sports meet, Violet finally musters the courage to ask Tony out on a date.\n\nViolet appears in the film's sequel \"Incredibles 2\" (2018), in which she receives more screen time. The film follows Violet as she struggles with being a teenager and a superhero simultaneously, resuming shortly after Violet and Tony have agreed to go on their first date. Tony witnesses Violet and her family battling The Underminer, discovering that Violet is a superhero when she unknowingly removes her mask in his presence, prompting him to run away. Violet protects her family from The Underminer by creating her most powerful force field to-date. Despite limiting the destruction of the villain, superheroes remain illegal, and the Parrs remain prohibited to use their powers, which frustrates Violet. Government agent Rick Dicker erases Tony's memories of the event and inadvertently wipes Tony's memory of Violet altogether, forcing Violet to come to terms with the consequences. Violet's storyline revolves around her struggling with teenage angst, boys, dating and adolescence, while mother Helen, who has been recruited by a pair of entrepreneurs in order to repair superheroes' public image in the hopes of legalizing them again, leaves Violet and her siblings in Bob's charge, who becomes challenged with parenting Violet, attempting to make her feel better as she explores her teenage romance. Although initially resentful towards Bob for the fact that Dicker erased Tony's memories of her to the point of which she \"renounces\" her superhero heritage, Violet eventually offers assistance upon realizing how much effort her father is putting into raising his children. At the end of the film, Violet simply re-introduces herself to Tony. Just as the characters are about to begin their first date, Violet postpones it so that she can help her family fight criminals instead, promising to rejoin him afterward.\n\nViolet has made several appearances in other media, with Vowell returning to voice the character in various media tie-ins and merchandise, including toys and cell phones.\n\nAmong the video games in which Violet appears is the original 2004 video game based on the film, Violet appears mostly in stealth missions, using her invisibility to maneuver past guards and enemies unnoticed. The character's invisibility is limited by her Incredi-Meter, which can become greatly depleted by the use of her powers. In later levels, players can combine the powers of Violet and Dash to create the Incredi-Ball, in which Violet surrounds both herself and Dash using a force field, and Dash runs within it to propel it forward. The Incred-Ball has been identified as virtually indestructible. On some platforms, Violet is able to use force fields to levitate other objects. In a negative review, Alex Navarro of \"GameSpot\" described Violet's levels as arguably \"the worst the game has to offer\" due to time limits that restrict her invisibility, making it \"difficult to gauge when a guard will or won't notice you.\" Similarly, \"Eurogamer\"'s Patrick Garratt wrote that younger children will find playing as Violet increasingly difficult to due to the character's tendency to \"run out of Incredible Power juice\" quickly, limiting her ability to \"sneak her way to the end of the level,\" while Duke Ferris of Game Revolution found the character's stealth levels to be \"particularly weak\". \"\" (2004) features 10 minigames that revolve around Violet and the rest of her family, particularly using Violet's powers to avoid difficult situations. The characters are first played as their secret identifies before players unlock levels in which they can then be played as their superhuman alter egos. There are two minigames that revolve around Violet and her abilities. In the first, \"Violet's Diary Drama\", she projects force fields to intercept Dash and prevent him from stealing her belongings, while \"Violet Surrounded\" features the character using a force field to protect herself from oncoming projectiles and deflect them back at Syndrome's henchmen.\n\nIn \"\" (2012), players explore six worlds based on various Pixar films, pairing them with Violet in some of the \"Incredibles\"-themed levels to navigate around hazards and obstacles. Violet is available as an add-on figurine for \"Disney Infinity\" (2013), sharing her abilities from the film (her force fields are identified as \"plasma shields\" in the game). When utilized, the character becomes a player character, and can be used in Toy Box mode, \"The Incredibles\" play set and her own adventure \"Violet's Stealth Mission\", in which the player uses Violet to retrieve as many collectibles as possible while remaining undetected by spotlights within a limited timeframe. Violet appears as a player character alongside her family in \"Lego The Incredibles\" (2018), in which her force fields can be used to intercept laser security systems. In early levels, Violet unites with Elastigirl and Dash to rescue Mr. Incredible from Syndrome; the titular family most often works together in order to overcome obstacles, such as Violet levitating over poisonous substances to assist Dash.\n\nIn 2004 Dark Horse Comics published a four-issue comics miniseries, \"The Incredibles\", written by director Brad Bird and Paul Alden, and drawn by Ricardo Ruiz and Ramón K. Pérez. It was collected in a trade paperback published in 2005.\n\nIn early 2009 Boom! Studios published the four-issue comics miniseries \"The Incredibles: Family Matters\" by writer Mark Waid and artist Marcio Takara. Later that year, Boom! premiered a monthly ongoing series, titled simply \"The Incredibles\", with Waid joining Landry Walker on writing duties from issues 0 - 7, after which Walker wrote the series by himself. Various artists illustrated the title during its 15-issue run, which was collected in four trade paperbacks. The series holds a rating of 8.0 out of 10 on the review aggregator website Comic Book Round Up.\n\nIn 2004, a children's book based on \"The Incredibles\" was published entitled \"The Incredibles: Violet's Incredible Diary\", written by children's author Richard Dungworth. Described as \"Violet's side of the story\", the book follows the film albeit written from Violet's perspective in the form of a diary.\n\nViolet has garnered positive reviews from film critics. \"The Washington Post\"'s Jennifer Frey described Violet as \"instantly familiar as the teenage girl who pines for the cute boy, fights with her little brother and is so uncertain of herself\". In addition to appreciating Pixar's decision to cast the lesser-known Vowell, Joshua Tyler of CinemaBlend dubbed Violet his \"favorite character\" in \"The Incredibles\", praising her many \"goose-bump worthy moments as she starts to accept who she is.\" Commending the multidimensionality of the film's characters, Hollywood.com's Julia Emmanuele observed that, through Violet, audiences \"understand how awkward and insecure being a teenager can be, even without the addition of superpowers.\" Vulture.com's Abraham Riesman described Vowell's voice acting as \"terrific\". In addition to praising Vowell's performance, Carla Meyer of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote that her character ultimately \"emerges as the most sympathetic member of the family\". In a retrospective review, Jonathon Dornbush of IGN cited \"Violet’s sense of isolation and misunderstanding\" among the main reasons \"The Incredibles\" remains \"a deeply relatable, enduring film\" and \"one of Pixar's best\". \"Slate\" film critic David Edelstein acknowledged the difficulty of animating Violet's hair while calling her ability to create force fields \"to die for\".\n\nGermain Lussier of io9 deemed Violet as \"arguably [one of] the best parts of \"Incredibles 2\",\" writing that her \"journey through adolescence not only gives her a great arc, but some truly hilarious and embarrassing moments too.\" \"The Globe and Mail\"'s Barry Hertz found Violet's design and animation particularly impressive, likening the scene in which she dries her hair to \"glimpsing the future of animation, where the real and the unreal fold into each other.\" Patricia Puentes of CNET found Violet's role in the film to be empowering for teenage girls, praising the character's decisions to re-introduce herself to Tony and ultimately choose to fight crime over their date, concluding, \"This teenage girl prefers to go catch some bad guys -- because she's a hero and that's her calling -- over having a date with the guy she likes.\" The Ringer editor Juliet Litman identified Violet as \"a galvanizing force\" in the sequel, crediting her with \"propelling the plot in crucial moments and injecting raw emotion into the\" otherwise comedic film. Litman also commended Vowell for recognizing \"The precise balance of the serious and lighthearted[ness]\" required for her role, concluding that it has become difficult to imagine Violet voiced by any other actress. Syfy Wire writer Kristy Puchko described Violet's reaction to being stood up by Tony as \"all too familiar\". Writing for Vulture.com, Edelstein called it \"wonderful to hear Sarah Vowell and her euphonious quack as the irritable Violet,\" describing the character as \"the quintessential brilliant but ever-stricken and angry teenage girl.\" \"The New Yorker\"'s Anthony Lane wrote that Vowell \"still provides the pitch and yaw of adolescent speech—now tetchy, now timid, but touched here and there with a determination that might just save the day.\"\n\nSome critics complained that the character was underused in the sequel. CNET contributor Mike Sorrentino wrote that the film's emphasis on Helen and Bob results in Violet being \"relegated to the sidelines for most of the film\", while Screen Daily's Tim Grierson wrote that the character's \"awkward dating woes all streak by too quickly.\" For Screen Rant, Molly Freeman observed that the character's arc \"largely exist[s] to serve Bob's own storyline\". Writing that while Violet's storyline offered \"a great deal of potential\" by \"exploring how a child with superpowers growing up in a world where superheroes are illegal could affect her sense of self\", Freeman criticized it for being \"boiled down to either focusing on her dating life or providing a challenge for Bob to overcome.\" However, the critic acknowledged that Violet is provided with several opportunities \"to demonstrate [her] visually compelling superpowers.\"\n\nVowell's performance and character have proven to be particularly popular among young women and teenager girls, from whom she continues to receive positive feedback. Cosmic Book News crowned Violet \"the teen-queen of sarcasm\", while Michelle Lima of Oh My Disney wrote that the character boasts \"some seriously amazing sarcasm skills.\" Ana Luisa Suarez of Hollywood.com considers Violet's sarcasm to be among \"15 Reasons Why 'The Incredibles' Is The Best Superhero Movie\". \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Violet the 20th \"Best Pixar Movie Character\", ahead of Mr. Incredible (24th), with author Alissa Wilkinson calling her \"super-smart ... which makes the moment when she finally transforms into a confident superheroine ... that much more delightful.\" Hypable ranked Violet the third best \"Incredibles 2\" superhero, with author Aaron Locke writing, \"It would be great to see Violet take on an investigation of her own.\"\n\nPajiba ranked Violet Pixar's ninth best female character. IndieWire ranked Vowell's work as Violet Pixar's 19th greatest performance, writing that her \"quirky tones perfectly captures the kind of girl who wishes she could (and in this case actually can) fade into the background,\" continuing, \"the way she eventually finds her own voice is one of the most moving aspects of the film.\" Similarly, The Playlist also ranked Vowell's performance 19th. The Cinemaholic ranked \"The Incredibles\" the third best film featuring invisible characters, with author Clarisse Tenreiro writing that Violet \"possesses perhaps the coolest power of\" the film's characters.

The company was known as World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) in 1982 as they introduced the WCWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship, on occasion billed as the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship (\"Texas version\"). As it is a professional wrestling championship, it is won not by actual competition, but by a scripted ending to a match.\n\nThe first champions were The Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes, Terry Gordy and Buddy Roberts), who won the championship on December 25, 1982 as part of WCCW's annual Christmas Star Wars show. For storyline purposes David Von Erich actually substituted for Buddy Roberts in the match, citing \"travel difficulties\". After winning the match Von Erich gave the belt to Buddy Roberts, which was part of a building storyline feud between the Freebird and The Von Erichs. The Von Erich/Freebird storyline feud played a major part in the history of the championship as various combinations of Freebirds and Von Erichs were involved in 17 of the 19 reigns. Michael Hayes, Kevin Von Erich and Kerry Von Erich were the last team to hold the championship as it was abandoned in 1988.\n\nThe Freebird combination of Hayes, Roberts and Gordy held the championship a total of five times, the most of any trio. Kevin Von Erich held the championship 11 times with various partners including his father Fritz Von Erich, brothers Kerry, David and Mike Von Erich, as well as Michael Hayes, Brian Adias, Chris Adams, Steve Simpson and Lance Von Erich. The longest individual reign lasted 282 days as Kevin, Mike and Lance held the title from July 4, 1986 to April 12, 1987. The Freebirds' five reigns combined to at least 581 days, the longest combined of any team. Fritz, Kevin and Mike Von Erich held the championship for a matter of hours, as Fritz gave his third of the championship to Kerry Von Erich at the end of the show where they won it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2069661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069661", "title": "Dunboyne", "text": "Dunboyne\n\nDunboyne () is a town in Meath, Ireland. It is located close to Blanchardstown and is a commuter town for Dublin. In the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 censuses, the population of Dunboyne more than doubled from 3,080 to 7,272 inhabitants.\n\nDunboyne is centred on the crossroads formed by the R156 regional road and the old Maynooth Road (formerly designated R157).\n\nDunboyne's Irish language (Gaelic) name, Dún Búinne, indicates it was the fort of Bui who was the wife of the god Lugh. Dunboyne was home to many men who fought for and against British rule in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. During the War of Independence the town was Division Headquarters to the IRA (Irish Republican Army) 1st Eastern Division, a unit formed in April 1921 under Divisional commander, Seán Boylan. The Division consisted nine brigades: 1st Brigade (south Meath & north Kildare); 2nd (Navan & Trim); 3rd (Kells, Virginia & Mullagh); 4th, Delvin; 5th (Mullingar & north Westmeath); 6th, Edenderry; 7th (Naas & south Kildare); 8th Fingal; and 9th (Drogheda & south Louth). Dunboyne got its name from Boann, the goddess of the River Boyne. The River Tolka runs through Dunboyne.\n\nDunboyne Castle, originally a castle was built as a seat for a branch of the Butler dynasty, the Lords Dunboyne. It later passed to the Mangan family and was the seat of Simon Mangan, HM Lieutenant for County Meath in the 1890s and 1900s.\n\nThe house was sold in 1950 and became the Good Shepherd convent, in which nuns used to live and operate a mother and baby home, the Árd Mhuire mother and baby home in Dunboyne was opened by the sisters of the Good Shepherd in 1955. It closed in 1991. A partial section of the building has been dismantled. In 2006, the convent was sold and converted into a hotel.\n\nDunboyne Athletic Club was founded in 1928 and is located on the Rooske Road, where facilities include a 400-metre, all-weather track, IAAF standard hammer throwing cage and club house. In 2013 the club had 790 registered members.\n\nThe local GAA team, St Peters Dunboyne GAA, won the Meath Senior Football Championship championship in 1998, 2005 and 2018. Dunboyne man Seán Boylan was the longest-serving county manager in GAA history and led Meath to four All Ireland victories in 1987, 1988, 1996 and 1999.\n\nSince its foundation in 1996, Dunboyne Ladies GFC remains the only standalone Ladies Gaelic football club in Meath. Dunboyne Ladies GFC have won Meath Championships several times in all under age levels up to and including Under 21s.\n\nDunboyne was a motor racing venue between 1958 and 1967 for both cars and motorbikes. The racing circuit was a 4 mile long triangular shaped circuit with a combination of fast straights and hairpin bends. The start/finish line was in the centre of Dunboyne village and the racing circuit itself consisted of public roads around the village. During these years races such as the Leinster Trophy, Dunboyne Trophy and Holmpatrick Trophy were held. \n\nDunboyne has two football clubs, Dunboyne FC and Dunboyne AFC. Dunboyne AFC's grounds are on the Summerhill Road which has a floodlit astro turf pitch, three 11 a-side pitches, two small-sided pitches, club shop, and clubhouse. Dunboyne FC plays in the Phoenix Park. They were both officially opened by Pele in November 2009 in recognition of the club receiving the FAI Club of the Year award for 2009.\n\nThe GUI National Golf Academy is located 5 km outside Dunboyne on the Maynooth Road. It has a driving range, putting green and short game area. There is also a golf society in Dunboyne.\n\nTwo Irish rugby internationals, brothers Tom and Conleth Feighery who received a number of international caps in the 1970s, were born locally.\n\nPrimary schools serving the area include Dunboyne Junior Primary School, Dunboyne Senior Primary School, Gaelscoil Thulach na nÓg and St Peter's National School (Church of Ireland).\n\nIn 2002 the headmaster at Gaelscoil Thulach na nÓg was dismissed by the board of patrons for writing a letter to the parents of the children which was deemed by the Board of Management to be misconduct. The parents of the school were divided on the issue, with some reportedly believing that the incident was unfairly represented in the press.\n\nThe local secondary school is St. Peter's College.\n\nDunboyne College of Further Education, located in Dunboyne Business Park, provides full-time courses at FETAC level 5. It is for PLC. The college operates under the authority of the County Meath Vocational Education Committee. As of 2016, 38 post-leaving certificate courses were offered by the college. \n\nLocal youth club Cumann na bhFiann was begun in 2001, originating from the organisation \"Coláiste na bhFiann\". The aim of the club is to promote the Irish language. Approximately 50 students participate in the club, which takes place from September to May. Foróige, an English speaking youth club, meets on Friday nights.\n\nIn 1985 a public meeting was held in Dunboyne, and it was agreed that a social and recreational centre was needed. Four years of fund-raising followed, and over £400,000 was raised. The Irish government contributed grants totalling £35,000, and a community centre was opened by then-President of Ireland, Dr Patrick Hillery, in 1989.\n\nWith the establishment of St Peter's College on the adjoining site in 1994, the opportunity arose to undertake a venture which subsequently became a model for school/community ventures elsewhere in Ireland. The money that would have been spent on putting sports facilities into the college, £280,000, was instead invested in the centre. Through further fund-raising, the committee added another £150,000 to this and the result was a major extension of the building in 1997. This arrangement provided the college with a larger sports hall than it otherwise would have had while, outside of school hours, the extension enabled the centre to cater to the growing community better. Health and fitness facilities were added in early 2000, and a floodlit all-weather pitch (another joint venture with St Peter's College), whose development began in 2003.\n\nDunboyne is situated primarily on the Station Road (L2228) Regional Road, at the intersection of the Maynooth Road (L2227) The town also lies parallel with the M3 motorway, which connects to L2228 using the R157 at a roundabout west of the town.\n\nThere are two rail stations in Dunboyne. Dunboyne railway station, which was built to service the town and is situated to the east of the town and M3 Parkway railway station which was built to service commuters using the M3 coming down from Navan. They were built as part of the reopening of the Navan-Clonsilla line under the Irish Governments Transport 21 development programme. However, due to a lack of funding, this railway stops after the M3 Parkway railway station just outside of Dunboyne. The original Dunboyne railway station was opened on 29 August 1862 and closed on 1 April 1963.\n\nDunboyne is served by three bus routes: the 70 and 70d (operated by Dublin Bus) and 270 (operated by Go-Ahead Ireland). There is also a limited Bus Éireann service to/from Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells on route 109 and to Mullingar, Killucan, Rathmolyon and Summerhill on route 118.\n\nBus Éireann route 109 provides two journeys a day in the morning to Kells via Dunshaughlin and Navan and two return journeys in the evening. No Bus Éireann services serve Dunboyne on Sundays. Bus Éireann route 111 between Dublin and Athboy stops at the M3 parkway station, just outside Dunboyne.\n\nThe Castle River flows into the Tolka river and flooding in and around Dunboyne has been attributed to problems further down the Tolka. Alleviation works have resulted in the risk of flooding being lessened. The last major flood was in 2002, preceded by a flood in 2000.\n\nOn 11 May 2007, the town was hit by a small tornado in which slates were torn from roofs and branches from trees during a brief storm.\n\nThe 1970s television series, \"The Riordans\", set in the fictional townland of Leestown, was filmed in Dunboyne. Some for the RTÉ \"Ear to the Ground\" program was also filmed locally, including at the GAA grounds on the Rooske Road, in 2006.\n\n\n\n"}

The goal of the project, started in 1991, is to develop a highly portable, yet efficient, operating system for massively parallel-distributed memory systems.\n\nSUNMOS uses a single-tasking kernel and does not provide demand paging. It takes control of all nodes in the distributed system. Once an application is loaded and running, it can manage all the available memory on a node and use the full resources provided by the hardware. Applications are started and controlled from a process called \"yod\" that runs on the host node. Yod runs on a Sun frontend for the nCUBE 2, and on a service node on the Intel Paragon.\n\nSUNMOS was developed as a reaction to the heavy weight version of OSF/1 that ran as a single-system image on the Paragon and consumed 8-12 MB of the 16 MB available on each node, leaving little memory available for the compute applications. In comparison, SUNMOS used 250 KB of memory per node. Additionally, the overhead of OSF/1 limited the network bandwidth to 35 MB/s, while SUNMOS was able to use 170 MB/s of the peak 200 MB/s available.\n\nThe ideas in SUNMOS inspired PUMA, a multitasking variant that only ran on the i860 Paragon. Among the extensions in PUMA was the Portals API, a scalable, high performance message passing API. Intel ported PUMA and Portals to the Pentium Pro based ASCI Red system and named it Cougar. Cray ported Cougar to the Opteron based Cray XT3 and renamed it Catamount. A version of Catamount was released to the public named OpenCatamount.\n\nIn 2009, the Catamount lightweight kernel was selected for an R&D 100 Award.\n\n\n"}

She assumed her father's duties in March 2016, upon his retirement, and has claimed the headship of the House of Romania since his death on 5 December 2017. She also heads the Princess Margareta of Romania Foundation.\n\nUntil 2011, she also used the style of a princess of Hohenzollern. Margareta has four sisters and no brothers or children. Her heir-presumptive is her next sister, Princess Elena of Romania. According to the defunct royal constitutions of 1923 and 1938, women were barred from wearing the crown, and Margareta and her sisters would not be in the line of succession to the throne.\n\nOn 30 December 2007, King Michael designated Margareta as heir presumptive to the defunct throne by an act that is not recognized by the Romanian government and lacks legal validity without approval by Romania's Parliament. On the same occasion, Michael also requested that, should the Romanian Parliament consider restoring the monarchy, the Salic law of succession not be reinstated, allowing female succession. According to the new statute of the Romanian Royal House as declared by Michael, no illegitimate descendants or collateral lines may claim dynastic privileges, titles or rank and any such are excluded from the Royal House of Romania and from the line of succession to the throne.\n\nMargareta was born on 26 March 1949 at Clinique de Montchoisi in Lausanne, Switzerland as the first of King Michael I and Queen Anne's five daughters. She was baptised in the Romanian Orthodox Church; her godfather is Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Her godmother was her maternal grandmother Princess Margaret of Denmark who was also her namesake. She was followed by four sisters: Princess Elena (born 1950), Princess Irina (born 1953), Princess Sophie (born 1957) and Princess Maria (born 1964).\n\nMargareta spent her childhood at family homes in Lausanne and at Ayot House, St Lawrence, in Hertfordshire, England. During holidays she and her sisters spent time with their grandparents; paternally with Helen, Queen Mother, at \"Villa Sparta\" in Italy and maternally, with Princess Margaret and her husband Prince René of Bourbon-Parma in Copenhagen. She and her sisters were told \"fascinating tales of a homeland they couldn't visit\" by their father. She also spent time with relatives in Greece, Italy, Denmark, Luxembourg and Spain.\n\nMargareta met Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom for the first time in the summer of 1952 at Balmoral Castle, when she was three years old. In her childhood, she spent holidays with Prince Charles and his sister, Princess Anne, who were close to Margareta, as well as Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, and the Greek, Danish and Luxembourg royal families.\n\nQueen Helen's interest in horses influenced Margareta to become an equestrian.\n\nIn 1964, along with five other princesses, Margareta was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark to King Constantine II of Greece.\n\nIn 1956 Margareta lived with Queen Helen for six months at her villa in Florence, attending kindergarten until returning to Switzerland, where she attended a primary school, with Princess Sophie, from age six to nine.\n\nIn 1960 she was sent to a boarding school in Old Basing, Hampshire, where she stayed until she was 13; she found it difficult to be away from home but was glad that she became more mature, noting that her English improved later.\n\nHer favourite subjects were: art, riding and natural sciences (she learned how to grow plants) and also piano lessons.\n\nIn 1964 she began secondary education at a French school in Switzerland, where she studied philosophy.\n\n\"I did my baccalaureate in Switzerland, got my driving licence the next day and I left very fast. I really didn't enjoy the baccalaureate, I didn't enjoy school, I didn't enjoy Switzerland\" Margareta said in an interview in 2007.\n\nAfter her Swiss-French baccalaureate, rather than heading straight for Paris and studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, her preferred destination, she was persuaded to return to Florence to spend a year with her Romanian grandmother, whom she described as \"my spiritual guide, my mentor, guiding star. She taught me a lot about life, opened my eyes to all that is beautiful and good in the world\". Her dreams of art school were soon replaced by a determination to go to university.\n\nQueen Helen's aesthetic tastes extended Margareta's cultural horizons and excited her to meet interesting people who were part of her grandmother's circle of acquaintances, in which she met Romanian and Greek diplomats, artists, intellectuals, scientists and craftsmen, as well as subjects. Helen grandmother took the opportunity to encourage the Margareta to attend a university and pursue a career at the United Nations.\n\nAs relatives and friends of her parents lived in London, Margareta was hesitant to attend a university there, not wanting to be tied down by formalities associated with being a princess, and chose instead to attend the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Known there as \"Margareta de Roumanie\", for the first few weeks she felt a depressing \"sense of foreignness\". She studied sociology, political science and public international law. Engaging herself in activities on the campus, she became a member of the students' representative council. In 1974 she completed her studies and obtained her degrees.\n\nDuring an interview from 2011 she confessed that her first desire was studying philosophy: \"I really enjoyed philosophy, but I realized I had to be a bit more practical. Then, in the 1970s, sociology was fashionable, so I chose it alongside the international law I wanted for the United Nations, and the political sciences because they could relate to international relations and give the opportunity to know systems. This combination of studies was very interesting. Maybe now, if I had to resume, I would do something more practical.\"\n\nWhile at the University during her twenties, Margareta was involved in a five-year romantic relationship with Gordon Brown, who would serve as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2010; In 2007 she was interviewed by an editor of \"The Daily Telegraph\": \"It was a very solid and romantic story; I never stopped loving him, but one day it didn't seem right any more, it was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing,\" she said.\n\nAfter her graduation in 1974, she worked in a number of British universities for a few years, specialising in medical sociology and Public health policy. Later she participated in an international research program coordinated by the World Health Organization that focused on developing health policy recommendations and preventive pilot projects.\n\nIn 1979, she then worked for the agencies of the United Nations: The World Health Organization and The United Nations Population Fund, where she joined Social projects in public health, based in Africa and Latin America where she came into contact with suffering and deficiencies of the disadvantaged which was the kick start of her experience of the beginning of a road in humanitarian service, which she has still followed since then.\n\nIn 1983, she moved to Rome and joined the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations where, as a member of the World Food Day project team, she worked for three years on the public awareness campaign concerning agricultural programs, nutrition, and poverty alleviation. She belonged to the International Fund for Agricultural Development team until 1986.\n\nIn 1986, she joined the International Fund for Agricultural Development where she handled relations with nongovernmental organizations and assisted in raising funds for IFAD programs.\n\nProblems started to arise in Romania and in the summer of 1989 Margareta resigned from her job. Concluding that something fundamental was needed in Eastern Europe, she moved to Geneva to work with the Romanian Crown Council and the Royal family, whose members began preparing themselves for what was to come.\n\nIn mid 1989, civil and governmental unrest started arising in the Eastern Bloc as the loosening of control of Eastern Europe by the Soviet Union had triggered most of the impact for the former states which started a Revolutionary wave leading to the Revolutions of 1989.\n\nIn early December 1989, there was civil unrest by the anti-government protesters and on 16 December 12-day Romanian Revolution started; On the commands of Dictator President Nicolae Ceaușescu a mass genocide was led by members of the military who unanimously switched on the 22nd from supporting him to backing the protesting population. On 25 December the Dictator President Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Deputy Prime Minister Elena Ceaușescu were deposed, captured and executed by orders from a Drumhead military tribunal; 42 years of the Socialist Republic of Romania had ended. The revolution was the first overthrow of the ruling governmental system since King Michael's Coup which he successfully staged in 1944 by arresting members of the Military Government which supported Nazi Germany.\n\nDuring the Revolution, all members of the Royal Family took a part to console the situation outside of Romania.\n\nWhile she was visiting one orphanage, a child in a filthy cot died in front of her. It spurred her to establish the \"Princess Margareta of Romania Foundation\" in 1990.\n\nOperating in Romania, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, France, Belgium and the United States, the \"Princess Margareta of Romania Foundation\" develops programs that:\n\nThe foundation has raised more than five million euros, through which it contributes to the development of Romanian civil society.\n\nSince taking up permanent residence in Romania, along with her parents, Margareta continues to engage in public activities there, sometimes along with officials of the Romanian Republic including, for example, in January 2015 the celebration of the 25th year since her return to Romania held at the Romanian Athenaeum, followed by a dinner at the CEC Palace with Romania's Prime Minister Victor Ponta and Senate President Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu; and of 200 guests — foreign personalities, but also Romanian ones activating in all fields of interest, who have supported the Royal Family for the past 25 years. Out of these personalities of Romania, the United States of America, France, and Switzerland, a certain number was decorated by Margareta, on the occasion of the aforementioned series of events. Among the foreign personalities decorated was Frédéric Mitterrand, the nephew of the former president of France as well as hosting a March 2015 gala at the dynasty's historical family seat, Peleș Castle, in honour of the Romanian Rugby Union, attended by Klaus Johannis, the first incumbent Romanian president to pay an official visit to the former royal family.\n\nOn 15 May 2015, the General Assembly of the Romanian Red Cross elected Margareta as President of the Romanian Red Cross. The Red Cross was instituted as a Romanian branch of the International Red Cross in 1876, under the reign of her great-great grand uncle King Carol I of Romania, it benefited from important support from his wife Queen Elisabeth; From 1915, the Romanian Red Cross received the leadership of Margareta's Paternal great grandmother Queen Marie, who was seen as a symbol, an ambassador and an inspirational leader of the organisation; Margareta's paternal grandmother: Queen Helen, Queen Mother also provided great patronage to the organisation during the Second World War. This is a role in which Margareta will be further leading by following and fulfilling the legacy of her ancestors.\nIn her statement, she expressed her gratitude to the Romanian Red Cross representatives, who re-established a long and valuable tradition of partnership between the oldest organization in the country and the Romanian Crown.\n\nIn September 2015 she and her Red Cross entourage organised a 2-day festival for the 28th annual First Aid Convention in Europe held at Herăstrău Park, where there was an annual competition that brought together teams of first aid from the Red Cross and Red Crescent in Europe to demonstrate their abilities of first aid through demonstrations of emergency intervention and a gala held later on in the day for the chance for the Red Cross members to meet with each other; 500 personalities from 28 first aid teams in 24 European countries took part in the FACE competition.\n\nFrom the 6–10 December 2015 Margareta travelled to Geneva, Switzerland with her Red Cross entourage and accompanied by Lazăr Comănescu, Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs for the 32nd International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent where she met with representatives of the Government of Switzerland, International Red Cross and Red Crescent and Members of the Diplomatic corps; During the conferences, Margareta spoke about the effectiveness of her leadership and the participation of the 'Romanian Red Cross in national and foreign affairs and also the analysis of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 of the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction which is complemented by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.\nOn the final day of the conferences Margareta discussed with her Foreign Royal counterparts: Grand Duchess Maria Teresa of Luxembourg, President of the Luxembourg Red Cross; Duchess Sophie, Hereditary Princess of Liechtenstein, President of the Liechtenstein Red Cross and Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, President of the Netherlands Red Cross about the relationships of Royalty and the dedication one must have towards the National Red Cross.\n\nAlthough at her birth she was not expected to inherit the defunct Romanian throne and the headship of the Romanian Royal Family, the birth of four younger sisters and no brother meant that without a change in the royal family's succession laws, male members of the House of Hohenzollern would succeed her father as pretenders to the Romanian throne, in accordance with the Salic law enshrined in both the defunct royal Romanian Constitution of 1923 and the defunct Statute of the Romanian royal house, dated 1884.\n\nIn 1997 King Michael designated Margareta as successor to \"all prerogatives and rights\" of his, indicating his desire for a gender-blind succession to the throne; although there was much consideration of altering the line of succession, no actions were taken until 30 December 2007, when King Michael I issued the statutes for the Royal House, called \"The Fundamental Rules of the Royal House of Romania\",\n\nFollowing the announcement of \"The Fundamental Rules\", King Michael asked the Romanian Government that, should it consider restoring the monarchy, it should also abolish the Salic law of succession.\n\nAs Margareta has no children, her designated heir is her younger sister Princess Elena.\n\nAccording to the Romanian Constitution of 1923, which barred women from ascending to the throne, Margareta and her sisters are not eligible to succeed to the throne of Romania, which is also why King Michael issued \"The Fundamental Rules\", which comply with EU legislation, in particular with the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nAccording to article 1, paragraph 2 of the Fundamental Rules of the Royal Family of Romania, \"The Head of the Royal House of Romania, according to all the practices and conventions of today, is de jure or de facto Sovereign in terms of authority over the Royal House of Romania at any moment. Immediately after the death of the Head of the Royal House of Romania, without any subsequent proclamation, the Evident Heir or the Presumptive Heir, depending on who will be alive and the first in the succession line at that time, will receive from that moment the title and the name of King or Queen, regardless of the position of the Family as a Reigning or Non-Reigning Dynasty, and whether or not he/she will later choose to use such a title or appellation.\" Accordingly, since Romania is still a republic, Margareta, chose not to use the title of Queen and is instead \"Custodian of the Romanian Crown\", a title that Michael I offered her.\n\nPaul-Philippe Hohenzollern (son of King Michael's illegitimate half-brother, Carol Lambrino) denounces King Michael's actions of creating \"The Fundamental Rules\" and severing ties with the House of Hohenzollern. Paul also claims to be head of the Romanian Royal Family, unlike his father.\n\nAlthough Margareta has no official role within the politics of Romania to maintain ties with other countries, she does however heed to and maintain the morals of the House of Romania in which she develops and keeps close ties with foreign countries, governments, heads and former heads of state and also the people of the country; During these visits she is often accompanied by her husband Prince Radu, who is a special Romanian Government representative for Integration, Co-operation and Sustainable Development. During visits which she undertakes, accompanied by Prince Radu, they often hold lectures of what Romania contributes to the European Union.\n\nMargareta has been to foreign countries for visits, such as: Belgium: meeting privately with King Albert II, his wife Queen Paola and their daughter Princess Astrid in May 2008; The Czech Republic: meeting with Livia Klausová, 3rd First Lady in February 2007 and a second time meeting with Petr Nečas, 9th Prime Minister in November 2010; Denmark: meeting privately with Queen Margrethe II and her husband Prince Henrik in November 2010; France: meeting with Hans-Gert Pöttering, 23rd President of the European Parliament in June 2008; India: as a guest of the Governments of Maharashtra, Goa and Rajasthan meeting with the leaders and members of each cabinet in November 2004; Israel: as a guest of the Knesset meeting with members of the Cabinet of Israel and also Patriarch Theophilos III in April 2014; Jordan: meeting with King Abdullah II and members of the Royal Family in May 2014, 2017 and 2018; Moldova: meeting with President Nicolae Timofti, Prime Minister Iurie Leancă and members of the Cabinet of Moldova in October 2013; Qatar: meeting with Emir Hamad in November 2009; Spain: meeting privately with King Juan Carlos I and his wife Queen Sofia in June 2009; and King Felipe and Queen Letizia in 2018; Sweden: meeting privately with King Carl XVI and his wife Queen Silvia in June 2010; Turkey: meeting with Murat Yalçıntaş, President of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce in March 2008 and another time meeting privately with Bartholomew I of Constantinople in September 2012; the Vatican City for a private audience with Pope John Paul II in April 2003 and with Pope Benedict XVI in June 2012.\n\nShe has also been a guest of former royal families, such as: the Hohenzollerns: with Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia in September 2008; and the Karađorđevićs: with her 2nd cousin Crown Prince Alexander and his wife Crown Princess Katherine in 2007, 2010, November 2013, and 2015.\n\nApart from being present for official visits hosted by her father, Margareta hosts official visits at Elisabeta Palace, where there is: a private meeting, a meeting with members of the Romanian and foreign government, a visit to the local areas, a visit to her charity 'FPMR' and finally planting a tree in the garden of the palace to mark the visit of the guests.\n\nShe has hosted official visits from: Belgium: with her 2nd cousin Prince Lorenz, Archduke of Austria-Este in September 2015; the Czech Republic: with President Miloš Zeman in May 2014; Jordan: with Princess Muna al-Hussein in June 2013, May 2015, 2016, and 2017 and also with Princess Rym al-Ali in April 2011; Liechtenstein: with Hereditary Prince Alois and his wife Princess Sophie in June 2010; Lithuania: with Vytautas Landsbergis, former President of Lithuania and his wife Gražina Ručytė-Landsbergienė in June 2015; Luxembourg: with her 2nd cousin Prince Guillaume in September 2014; Senegal: with Viviane Wade, 3rd First Lady of Senegal in November 2008; Spain: with her 2nd cousin Felipe, Prince of Asturias and his wife Princess Letizia in April 2009; Switzerland: with members of the Swiss Federal Council in October 2002; United Kingdom: with her 4th cousin Charles, Prince of Wales, in June 2012, 2016, 2017, and 2018 and with Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, and his wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex, in June 2013.\n\nShe has also hosted visits for former royal families, such as: her 2nd cousin, former King Simeon II and his wife Queen Margarita of Bulgaria in November 2012 and 2016; her mother's cousin Crown Prince Otto of Austria in October 2005; Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia in April 2008, 2011;, 2016 and 2017; her 2nd cousin Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark in April 2012 and 2017; Prince Leka of Albania in June 2014 and 2017; her 2nd cousin Crown Prince Alexander and his wife Crown Princess Katherine of Yugoslavia in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2017; and Bernhard, Hereditary Prince of Baden and his wife Princess Stephanie in April 2013.\n\nMargareta also maintains close ties with her foreign reigning royal relatives, she has attended many events such as: the weddings of Prince Albert II of Monaco and Charlene Wittstock, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Daniel Westling, Prince Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and Countess Stéphanie de Lannoy, Prince William of Wales and Catherine Middleton, and many other royal weddings; anniversaries; The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II of United Kingdom, birthdays, and funerals.\n\nIn 1994, she met Radu Duda, a Romanian citizen and actor, through the work of the Princess Margareta Foundation. Duda was working as an art therapist in orphanages when he was introduced to the princess during her tour of the foundation's programs. On 21 September 1996 in Lausanne, Margareta married Duda. The religious service was officiated by Bishop Damaskinos of Switzerland, who also attended the wedding of Queen Ana and King Michael in 1948 when he was a young deacon. The Bishop attended all the special events of the Royal Family, such as the baptism of Margareta and her sisters, Elena and Irina, who also took part in the Greek Orthodox Church in Lausanne. This is also the place where the Queen Mother Hellen (Elena) of Romania was buried.\nDuring the religious service, Margareta was accompanied by King Michael, who was also a godfather in the first part of the wedding ceremony, along with King Constantine II of Greece, who was spiritual parent at the ceremony of gold crowns, according to the royal ritual.\nOver 250 guests, members of the royal families around the world, including Queen Sofía of Spain, Infanta Elena of Spain, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, Crown Prince Alexander and Princess Catherine of Serbia, Queen Farah of Iran, King Constantine II of Greece and Queen Anne-Marie, Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, Prince Hassan and Princess Sarvath of Jordan alongside hundreds of Romanians attended the religious ceremony and the following party at Polo Club. The royal couple spent the honeymoon in Jordan in Amman and in Aqaba on the shores of the Red Sea and the Dead Sea for 18 days at the invitation of the Jordanian Royal Family.\n\nHe was accorded the style \"Radu, Prince of Hohenzollern-Veringen\" on 1 January 1999, and was subsequently styled \"\"HRH\" Radu, Prince of Romania\", being referred to by King Michael on 30 December 2007, as future \"Prince Consort of Romania\". In Margareta's company and, more often alone, he has represented the former royal family publicly on various occasions. They live in the Elisabeta Palace in Bucharest.\n\nBAE Systems, one of the donors to the Princess Margareta of Romania Foundation, and its representatives have been involved in a corruption scandal involving purchase by the Romanian government of two decommissioned UK Royal Navy frigates refurbished by BAE, for which an alleged £7 million bribe was paid, some of which, it has also been alleged, ended up in the pockets of the Hohenzollern royal family to which Margareta belongs. The \"Gardianul\" newspaper, noting that both Margareta and her husband, as Special Representative of the Government, had met a number of times with the BAE Systems representatives before and after the signing of the governmental contract, inquired whether the royal family was involved in any lobbying on behalf of the company. In an official communiqué sent to the newspaper, Prince Radu denied any such lobbying activities, stating that as patron of the British-Romanian Chamber of Commerce of which BAE Systems is a member, he met with its representatives as well as those of other British companies.\n\nThe main pro-monarchist party PNŢCD, currently extra-parliamentary, is ambiguous in its support for Margareta. In 2002, it rejected any role for her or her husband in a restored monarchy, while in 2003 the Cluj branch of PNŢCD officially invited her to be its electoral candidate to the Senate of the Republic in upcoming elections.\n\nPrior to his death, King Michael had not given up the hope for the restoration of the throne: \"We are trying to make people understand what Romanian monarchy was and what it can still do.\"\n\nIn a July 2013 survey about a potential restoration of monarchy in Romania, 19% of respondents gave Margareta as their favorite, while 29.9% supported her father. 48.1% said they did not know or did not answer.\nIn December 2017, on the backdrop of the increased capital of trust in the Royal House of Romania, re-emerging with the death of King Michael, the executive chairman of the ruling Social Democratic Party Nicolae Bădălau said that one could organize a referendum on the transition to the monarchical ruling form, arguing that \"it is not a bad thing, considering that the countries that have the monarchs are developed countries\", being a project of the future. At the same time, the leader of the coalition party and the president of the Senate of Romania, Călin Popescu Tăriceanu, reinforced this idea, claiming that he is a convinced monarchist and \"Constitutional monarchy has the advantage of placing the monarch over political games, case: the president, instead of being an arbitrator, prefers to be a player. \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are carved into the cliffs surrounding the area of Akhetaten, or the Horizon of Aten, which demarcates the limits of the site. The Pharaoh Akhenaten commissioned the construction of Akhetaten in year five of his reign during the New Kingdom. It served as a sacred space for the god Aten in an uninhabited location roughly halfway between Memphis and Thebes at today's Tell El-Amarna. The boundary stelae include the foundation decree of Akhetaten along with later additions to the text, which delineate the boundaries and describe the purpose of the site and its founding by the Pharaoh. Total of sixteen stelae have been discovered around the area. According to Barry Kemp, the Pharaoh Akhenaten did not “conceive of Akhetaten as a city, but as a tract of sacred land”.\n\nSixteen boundary stelae have so far been discovered at Tell El-Amarna. The French Jesuit Claude Sicard was the first European to call attention to the stelae. He published a sketch of Stela A and a description of the site after visiting it in 1714. Stela U was discovered by A. C. Harris and George Gliddon in 1840 and, also in the early 1840s, another stela was discovered by George Lloyd of Brynestyn. Lloyd made a copy of Stela P, which was published along with a new copy of Stela A and a copy of Stela U made by Émile Prisse d'Avennes. Prisse was the first one to realize, based on the inscriptions on the stelae, that there must be at least six stelae that demarcate the area of the site. In 1843 and 1845, Karl Richard Lepsius travelled to the site with a Prussian expedition and discovered four new stelae, later named stelae K, M, N, and R. The practice of referring to the stelae with a discontinuous series of letters, in order to leave space for possible further discoveries, was begun by W. M. Flinders Petrie whose survey of Amarna was published in 1894. In 1892, Petrie found six new stelae at the site: stelae B and F on the western side of the Nile River, and stelae J, L, P, and V on the eastern side. From the previously found stelae, only Stela A is located in the western side. In 1893, Percy E. Newberry found Stela Q on the east bank. Jean Daressy published the earliest printed translation of the legible parts of the text, also in 1893, based on copies of stelae S and R, using variants found on stelae A and U. In 1898, stelae J, K, M, N, Q, R, S, and U were copied by Georg Steindorff who also photographed the sites of the stelae and took some loose fragments with him to Germany. Steindorff subsequently made his materials available for the Egypt Exploration Fund. In 1901, Norman de Garis Davies was shown the northernmost stela on the east bank, which led him to include the boundary stelae in his publication of the \"Rock Tombs of El Amarna\" in 1908. Davies's publication included a translation of the two different sets of stelae, which Davies named the “Earlier Proclamation” and the “Later Proclamation”, as well as of the texts that were added to the stelae bearing the Later Proclamation in the year eight of Akhenaten's reign. The latest addition to stelae A and B was termed the “Colophon” by Davies. A partial translation of the stelae had also appeared in James Henry Breasted’s \"Ancient Records\" published in 1906. An additional stela was discovered by the archeological survey of the Egypt Exploration Society in the season 2005-2006 and it was labeled Stela H.\n\nStelae K, M, and X on the east side of the Nile contain what Davies termed the Earlier Proclamation. All three stelae contain both vertical and horizontal lines of text. Stela K is the best preserved and was made to replace Stela M which was damaged early on, thus necessitating a replacement. Both Stela K and Stela M are located in the southern side of the site and the text in their horizontal lines reads from left to right, away from the center of the site. Stela X is located in the northern side of the site and it is a mirror image of stelae K and M in that its horizontal lines read from right to left, also away from the center. The inscription on the stelae K, M, and X is dated to the fifth regnal year of Akhenaten in day 13 of the season of Peret. They include the full title of the god Aten, as well as titles of the king Akhenaten and the king's wife Nefertiti. The stelae also describe the founding of the site by the pharaoh, reasons for choosing it, the proposed layout of the site, instructions regarding the burials of the royal family and certain notables, and instructions for the maintenance of the cult of Aten. The Earlier Proclamation also includes a promise from Akhenaten to build various temples and other structures to the god Aten in the location. The latter part of the text is fragmentary and has inspired a variety of interpretations.\n\nWhat Davies termed the Later Proclamation was carved on stelae J, N, P, Q, R, S, U, and V on the eastern side of the Nile, and on stelae A, B, and F on the western side. The inscription of the Later Proclamation is dated to year six of Akhenaten's reign in the day 13 of the season of Peret, which corresponds with the one year anniversary of the Earlier Proclamation, and includes a “renewal of the oath” that appeared in the Earlier Proclamation regarding the location and permanence of the site. with some modifications to include more land, especially a swath of agricultural land in the cultivation on the western side of the river. Titulary of the god Aten is also given, along with a repetition of much of the Earlier Proclamation. The Later Proclamation includes a description of events that took place after the inscription of the Earlier Proclamation, such as a journey of the pharaoh to the southeastern crag of the site. The Later Proclamation also mentions six principal boundary stelae that delimit the site.\n\nEarly in the year eight of Akhenaten's reign, in the season of Peret, a repetition of the oath of Akhenaten regarding the site is added to the stelae furnished with the Later Proclamation, and later that same year, in the season of Akhet, another text, termed the “Colophon” by Davies, is added to stelae A and B. The Colophon contains a reaffirmation of the borders and Aten's ownership of the site.\n\nStela L was found in 1892 by Petrie and is located about seven meters south from Stela M. The stela is different from the rest of the stelae in its small size and is badly weathered. Davies did not include Stela L among the boundary stelae due to its dissimilarity with the other stelae.\n\nThe boundary stelae of Akhenaten were carved in locations around the city of Akhetaten that was built by the pharaoh Akhenaten to his god Aten. Their purpose is to demarcate the boundaries of the holy site of Aten, but also to inform people about the intentions of the pharaoh and the nature of the site as a holy place for Aten. The boundary stelae are a major source of information about the religious reforms of Akhenaten, as they include the full titulary of the god Aten and other clues about the cult practiced in Akhetaten. The stelae are royal monuments commissioned by the pharaoh and thus contain an inherent bias that favors the king's undertakings and condemns those who opposed his reforms. They are nonetheless important historical artefacts and are very useful to historians.\n\nStelae X, M, and K have an image carved on top of the text, showing Akhenaten and Nefertiti worshipping Aten with their daughter Meritaten. Their second daughter Meketaten was later added to the picture in stela K, which is taken to signal that her birth must have taken place sometime after year five of Akhenaten's reign, to which year the Earlier Proclamation is dated. Another unnamed figure was also later added to Stela K, while Stela X, and probably also the damaged Stela M, included only Meketaten and her parents. The text of the Earlier Proclamation only mentions Meketaten and not her younger sisters. The stelae that have the Later Proclamation inscribed on them are more elaborate than the earlier ones and include rock-cut statues of the king and his wife, as well as two of their daughters, suggesting that the second daughter was born by the time these stelae were carved in the year six of Akhenaten. In addition to the second daughter that was added to Stela K, a third daughter is added to stelae A, B, P, Q, and U, which all have the Later Proclamation inscribed on them and are thus dated to year six or later of Akhenaten's reign. This has led Murnane and Van Siclen to conclude that only Meritaten had already been born by year five, while her younger sister Meketaten was most likely born during year five or six and the third princess Ankhesenpaaten toward the end of year six at the earliest, but most likely sometime in year seven or eight before the completion of the later stelae.\n\nDue to the fragmented part of the Earlier Proclamation making a mention of some unsavory things the pharaoh had heard at Thebes, a theory that posits a clash with the priesthood of Amun of Thebes has been put forward by scholars. Barry Kemp argues that the full expression of the beliefs of Akhenaten “demanded the creation of a physical sacred landscape” and that the boundary stelae are “the most extensive personal testimony we have as to what was in his mind”.\n\nAt least nine of the stelae have been damaged by thieves and one, Stela F, has disappeared altogether. Two others, stelae P and Q, have also been virtually destroyed.\n\nThe full title of the god Aten in the Earlier Proclamation is: “the Good God, who rejoices [in Ma’at], Lord of Heaven, Lord of [earth]; the [great living] o[rb who illumi]nates the two banks; (my [?]) Father, The Aten; the great living orb who is in jubilee within the [house] of the Orb in ‘Horizon of the Orb’”.\n\nThe title as given in the Later Proclamation is slightly different and reads: “the Good God who is content with Ma’at, the lord of heaven, the lord of earth, the great living orb who illuminates the Two Banks. Live the (divine, royal) Father, The Aten, given life everlastingly forever, the great living orb who is in jubilee within the estate of the orb in ‘Horizon of the Orb’”.\n\n"}

The Falls have receded upstream toward Lake Erie by slow erosion of hard Lockport Dolomite (a dolomitic limestone or dolomite, which is the surface rock of the escarpment), combined with rapid erosion of the relatively soft layers beneath it.\n\nThe force of the river current in the gorge is one of the most powerful in the world; because of the dangers this presents, kayaking the gorge has generally been prohibited.

He is most widely remembered as a possible inventor of the thaumatrope, which he published with W.

He also wrote about the accidents caused by the use of explosives in mines, and gave lectures to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall on chemistry as well as serving as the society's first secretary.

Located in Los Angeles, California, ONE Archives has been a part of the University of Southern California Libraries since 2010. ONE Archives' collections contain over two million items including periodicals; books; film, video and audio recordings; photographs; artworks; ephemera, such as clothing, costumes, and buttons; organizational records; and personal papers. ONE Archives also operates a small gallery and museum space devoted to LGBT art and history in West Hollywood, California. Use of the collections is free during regular business hours.\n\nONE Archives originated from ONE, Inc., which began publishing the earliest national homosexual publication in 1952. In 1956, ONE Inc. created the ONE Institute, an academic institute for the study of homosexuality, utilizing the term \"Homophile Studies.\" In 1994, ONE, Inc. and the International Gay and Lesbian Archives run by Jim Kepner merged. Since 1994 the organization has operated solely as a LGBT archive.\n\nONE Archives' mission statement reads as follows: \"It is the mission of ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries to collect, preserve, and make accessible LGBTQ historical materials while promoting new scholarship on and public awareness of queer histories.\"\n\nONE, Inc. was founded in 1952 to publish the nation's first wide-circulated, national homosexual periodical, \"ONE Magazine\". In 1953, ONE Inc. became the first gay organization to open a public office in Downtown Los Angeles. The original founders include Martin Block, Tony Sanchez (aka Tony Reyes), and Dale Jennings. The corporation's original core members included Martin Block, Tony Reyes, Dale Jennings, Guy Rousseau, Merton Bird, Don Slater, William Lambert (aka W. Dorr Legg), Eve Elloree (aka Joan Corbin), and Ann Carll Reid (aka Irma \"Corky\" Wolf).\n\nIn 1955, ONE Inc. held the ONE Midwinter Institute, the first in a series of conferences to bring together experts and community members to talk about gay and lesbian topics.\n\nIn 1956, ONE Inc. created the ONE Institute, an academic institute for the study of homosexuality under the name of \"Homophile Studies\".\n\nIn 1957, marking the first time the Supreme Court of the United States explicitly ruled on homosexuality, ONE Inc. fought to distribute its magazine by mail, and prevailed. The ruling in the case, \"One, Inc. v. Olesen\", not only allowed ONE to distribute its magazine, but also paved the way for other controversial publications to be sent through the U.S. mail.\n\nAlso during the 1950s ONE Inc. became an ad hoc community center and began a library. Jim Kepner was involved in adding material to this library.\n\nAs the burgeoning Gay Liberation movement took off and became more closely intertwined with the movements for civil rights of the 1960s and 1970s, ONE Inc., Jim Kepner and a growing group of activists were poised to collect original materials from that critical time period. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, ONE obtained crucial documents chronicling the establishment of the \"gay community\" and its established and increasingly diverse groups and organizations.\n\nSince the 1980s, the archival collections have grown substantially as gay issues and gay culture became more integrated into the mainstream culture of the United States.\n\nIn October 2012 ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives celebrated the 60th anniversary of its founding and the printing of \"ONE Magazine\".\n\nThe institutional history of ONE reveals a set of complex, overlapping and groundbreaking activities that provided a wide variety of pioneering services to LGBT Americans:\n\nThe collections at ONE Archives are primarily national in scope, with special focus on LGBT histories in the Los Angeles region. The archives also include a number of international materials, such as archival records and rare publications.\n\nONE houses over 600 archival collections of personal papers from activists, artists and ordinary citizens, as well as records from LGBTQ political, social, educational and cultural organizations. The collections include a wide array of materials such as manuscripts, photographs, letters, graphics, and other historically significant materials.\n\nImportant archival collections of note include:\n\nONE's main library collection comprises over 33,000 volumes of books and monographs; as well as over 13,000 titles of periodicals, such as magazines, newspapers, and newsletters. From issues of the earliest American LGBT publications to the most recent LGBT titles, the collection includes many rare and unusual titles, some of which may be the only copies in existence. The library also includes foreign publications in more than 40 different languages.\n\nONE's collection of audiovisual materials includes over 4,000 films, 21,000 videos (including 10 years of recorded lectures from ONE, Inc.), and 3,000 audio recordings. Many of ONE's films and videos are stored and preserved in conjunction with the Outfest Legacy Project at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.\n\nONE Archives' art collection include over 4,000 paintings, drawings, works on paper, photographs, and sculptural objects, the majority of which date from the 1940s to the present.\n\nONE Archives also collects and houses over 3,500 posters; textiles, such as T-shirts, banners and flags; and memorabilia such as buttons, matchbooks, dolls and other three-dimensional objects.\n\nSince 2008, ONE Archives has operated an exhibition space in West Hollywood, California dedicated to presenting temporary exhibitions on LGBT art and history. The gallery is located in a city owned building that also houses the June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives.\n\nIn 2011, ONE Archives participated in the region-wide initiative with the exhibition \"Cruising the Archive: Queer Art & Culture in Los Angeles, 1945-1980\" which was presented at the ONE Gallery in West Hollywood, as well as at ONE Archives' main location on West Adams Boulevard and in the Treasure Room at the Doheny Library at the University of Southern California Libraries. The exhibition included works by Steven F. Arnold, Don Bachardy, Claire Falkenstein, Anthony Friedkin, Rudi Gernreich, Sister Corita Kent, and Kate Millett, among many other less known or anonymous artists. The only exhibition dedicated to queer content within the PST initiative, this exhibition marked the most comprehensive exhibition of materials from the collections at ONE Archives to date and was accompanied by a scholarly catalogue. The publication included contributions by Ann Cvetkovich, Vaginal Davis, Jennifer Doyle, Jack Halberstam, Catherine Lord, Richard Meyer, Ulrike Müller, and Dean Spade.\n\nThe ONE Gallery has presented solo exhibitions of artwork by Steven F. Arnold and Joey Terrill, exhibitions of historical materials from the collections at ONE, and highlights from the collections of the Tom of Finland Foundation and the Center for the Study of Political Graphics.\n\n"}

It is located in Al Minya Governorate in Middle Egypt.\n\nThe oldest monument in the area is one of the Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten, up in the cliffs, protected by a glass 'booth'. This makes it quite difficult to see properly, but prevents further erosion.\n\nLater catacombs were dug under the necropolis; these were used to store thousands of sacred mummies of falcons, baboons and ibises.\n\nNear to the modern entrance to the catacombs is the tomb of the 4th century BC high priest Petosiris. This sepulchre is constructed to look like a temple, resembling Dendera. The outside is decorated in typical Late Period style, whereas the outer court is ornamented in a Greek style. The tomb was constructed around the time of the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great, and seems to have been decorated like this to curry favour with the new Ptolemaic rulers.\n\nIsadora was a wealthy and beautiful young woman living in Hermopolis during the time when the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius (AD 138–161) ruled over Ægyptus. She fell in love with a young soldier from Antinoöpolis (current Sheikh ‘Ibada), and they wanted to get married. However, her father refused, so the young couple decided to elope. Unfortunately, Isadora drowned while crossing the Nile. Her body was mummified, and her father built an elaborate tomb for her, featuring a poem of 10 lines inscribed in Greek elegiac couplets. At some time after her death, a cult developed around her tomb. Isadora's mummified remains are still present, encased in glass, in her mausoleum—a prominent building at Tuna el-Gebel.

Buffinton (born Buffington) (June 14, 1861 – September 23, 1907), was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1882 to 1892. One of the workhorse pitchers of the 1880s, he won 20 games seven times and his 1,700 career strikeouts are the ninth-highest total of the 19th century.\n\nBorn in Fall River, Massachusetts, Buffinton—mainly known for his brilliant sinker ball—began his career with the Boston Red Stockings/Beaneaters. He played in the days of 2- or 3-man pitching staffs and was a big part of many of his teams' successes. From 1883 to 1885 he was one of Boston's two principal pitchers along with Jim Whitney; together they picked up 62 of Boston's 63 wins in 1883 when the Beaneaters took the pennant. Buffinton's best season came right after that, though, when he went 48–16 with a 2.15 ERA in 67 starts in 1884. During that season, he struck out 17 batters in one game, won 13 straight games, and ended the year with 417 strikeouts, becoming one of seven pitchers that season to break the previous record of 361. Typical of the era, he completed 63 of his starts, with 8 being shutouts. Such win totals were not completely extraordinary at the time, as Buffinton's only 30-win season ranked third in the major leagues that year as Charles Radbourn set a record with 59 wins.\n\nAfter a poor 1886 season which saw him drop to 7–10 in more limited play due to arm trouble, his contract was sold to the Philadelphia Quakers in 1887. He pitched two one-hitters in a row for the team at one point and became the mainstay of their staff during his three years there, winning over 20 games in each. He jumped to the Philadelphia Athletics of the Players' League in 1890, posting a 19–15 record and managing the team for most of the year, before shifting to the American Association's Boston Reds in 1891. In Boston, he enjoyed a 29–9 year for the league champions – his last 20-win campaign. After a 4–8 record with the Baltimore Orioles in 1892, he retired rather than accept a midseason pay cut and went into business as an investor in coal and cotton. In 1893 the pitching distance in baseball was increased from 50 feet to 60 feet 6 inches, effectively ending his chances of returning.\n\nIn an 11-year career, Buffinton had a record of 233–152 with a 2.96 ERA in 414 games (396 starts). He pitched 351 complete games, including 30 shutouts, struck out 1,700 and allowed 1,120 earned runs in 3,404 innings pitched. At the time of his retirement he ranked between seventh and tenth in virtually every career pitching category, although due to the short history of the major leagues all of those ahead of him were his contemporaries. As the 1890s progressed he quickly dropped further down the lists. During his career, he also played as an outfielder for 137 games, and batted .245 for his career.\n\nBuffinton died in Fall River, Massachusetts, at the age of 46 from heart disease. He was laid to rest at the Oak Grove Cemetery in Fall River.\n\n\n"}

Chronologically it comes after the Study Symphony in F minor and before the \"nullified\" Symphony in D minor. (Symphony No. 2 in C minor was completed after the \"nullified\" Symphony in D minor.) The composer gave it the nickname \"\"Das kecke Beserl\"\", or \"The Saucy Maid\", and conducted its 1868 premiere. Much later, after Bruckner was granted an honorary University of Vienna doctorate in 1891, he dedicated the 1890 version of the work to that institution. \nThe symphony has four movements:\n\nThe choices of key for the first two movements mirror Beethoven’s for his Fifth Symphony, but Bruckner has the timpani retune to A and E.\n\nBefore completing the symphony in April 1866, Bruckner composed other forms of the Adagio and the Scherzo.\n\nThe Adagio was first conceived in classical sonata form, with development, not the ternary structure with elaborate middle section. It was partially orchestrated, without trumpets or trombones; the recapitulation of the second subject, which was sketched only by the second violins and the woodwinds, breaks off at bar 154. Thereafter, five bars were left unwritten before the — on the contrary — fully orchestrated close of the movement.\n\nThe originally conceived Scherzo was not fully orchestrated either, lacking trumpets and trombones, but its Trio was carried over unchanged in 1866. The scherzo of this draft version exhibits many irregular phrase rhythms which Bruckner evened out in later versions. In the leaflet for his recording of the symphony, Tintner says that \"the earlier very short Scherzo, which Bruckner discarded before 1866 (because of its brevity?), with chromatic syncopation, is perhaps more interesting [than the final one].\"\n\nIn 1995 Wolfgang Grandjean edited the earlier Adagio and Scherzo as a study score (I/1a-STP). For performance purposes, Grandjean filled in the missing bars of the Adagio using the corresponding musical material in the 1866 score (Doblinger 74 014).\n\nA recording of these movements by Osmo Vänskä is in the Bruckner Archive, and an electronic recreation of it by Joan Schukking can be heard and downloaded at John Berky’s website.\n\nThe first version of the symphony was written in 1866 by Bruckner in Linz. It was published in 1998 by William Carragan and first recorded that same year by Georg Tintner in Glasgow.\n\nBruckner made some slight adjustments to the score for the 1868 premiere. The premiere version has been issued by Thomas Röder in the new edition of the \"Bruckner Gesamtausgabe\" and has been premiered by the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra under Cornelius Meister during the 2014 Salzburger Festspiele. The first American performance using Röder’s edition, played by the Sam Houston State University Orchestra in 2016 with Jacob Sustaita conducting, can be heard and downloaded at John Berky’s website.\n\nAlthough routinely referred to as the “Linz” version and as having been made in 1866, this, the most frequently performed version of the work, was prepared neither in Linz nor in that year. It was made in 1877 in Vienna and revised there in 1884. It is available in editions by Robert Haas (published 1935) and Leopold Nowak (1953).\n\nThe Vienna version, which differs considerably from the earlier 1866 and 1877 versions, is available in an edition by Günter Brosche, published in 1980 as part of the \"Gesamtausgabe\".\n\nThis was the first published edition. Edited by Doblinger under the supervision of Cyrill Hynais, it had few differences from the 1891 version. It has been recorded by F. Charles Adler, Volkmar Andreae and Fritz Zaun (scherzo only).\nOf the (revised, 1877) \"Linz version\" and (1891) \"Vienna version\" in the earlier \"Gesamtausgabe\".\n\nOf the (1877) \"Linz version\", again under \"Gesamtausgabe\" auspices. \nOf the (1891) \"Vienna version\", again as part of the \"Gesamtausgabe\".\nOf the 1868 version, as part of the new \"Bruckner Gesamtausgabe\"\n\nThe score calls for a pair each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, and strings, with an extra flute in the Adagio.\n\nThe first recording of any part of the work was made in 1934 by Fritz Zaun and the Berlin State Opera Orchestra; it included only the Scherzo, in the 1893 first published edition. The first complete commercial recording of the symphony came in 1950, with Volkmar Andreae conducting the Lower Austrian Tonkünstler Orchestra, again using the first published edition.\n\nThere is a single commercially available recording of the early \"Adagio\" and \"Scherzo\":\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There are 22 known families of megasecopterans, with about 35 known genera.\n\nLike all other paleodictyopteroids, the megasecopterans had sucking mouthparts. The suctorial mouth parts were probably used to pierce plant casings and extract high-quality plant materials, such as spores and pollen.\n\nUnlike some earlier insects, megasecopterans bore two pairs of wings, which were nearly of the same size. The wings probably were held horizontally, as in dragonflies (Odonata, Anisoptera). The wing bases tend to be very slender and petiolated, as in damselflies (Odonata, Zygoptera). The body was usually long and thin, although the genus \"Protohymen\" was rather stouter and shorter than a typical megasecopteran. Another distinctive feature was the presence of a number of fine processes projecting from the body, which in some cases could be longer than the body itself, forming long fringes on the insect's underside.\n\nDuring their relatively brief period of existence, the Megasecoptera were rather successful. It has been estimated that this insect order accounted for 50% of the insect biomass in some locations, but the available evidence might be misleading..\n\nPalaeos.com\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial period, Lal-lo was known as Ciudad de Nueva Segovia and was the seat of the Diocese of Nueva Segovia before it was moved to Vigan in Ilocos Sur. There is a recent move in the Philippine Congress to rename Lal-lo back to its former name and reclassify the municipality again as a component city.\n\nRecently, the provincial government of Cagayan thru the leadership of Governor Manuel Mamba is planning to make Lal-lo the provincial capital of Cagayan again.\n\nAn international airport is currently being built in the southern part of Lal-lo. The Northern Cagayan International Airport is constructed to support the Cagayan Special Economic Zone in northern Cagayan and will also serve the seaborne traffic through Port Irene. The airport project involves the construction of a 2,200-meter runway, with a width of 45 meters, following the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Once completed, the international airport can accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A319-100 and Boeing regional jets of comparable size.\n\nRoyal Air Philippines do twice weekly service using BAe146 aircraft.\n\nLal-lo is politically subdivided into 35 barangays.\n\nLal-lo means \"twisting two strands to make a rope\", or may also refer to the strong river current as it is located along Cagayan River, the longest and largest river in the Philippines.\n\nIn the classical era, Lal-lo was used to be the home of hunter-gatherers who were specialized in hunting mollusks. These hunter-gatherers have stockpiled their leftover mollusk shells in numerous sites in Lal-lo and neighboring Gattaran, until eventually, the shells formed into the largest stock of shell-midden sites in the entire Philippines.\n\nThe first European to set foot on what is now the town of Lal-lo is Juan de Salcedo, the Spanish conquistador and grandson of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, in 1572. Don Juan Pablo Carrion established it as a \"pueblo\" (municipality) in 1581 and named it Nueva Segovia. The reason is currently unknown, as the hometown of this Spanish soldier was Carrión de los Condes (Palencia, Spain), as his last name, Carrión, suggests. This is mentioned by Juan Miguel Aguilera and Ángel Miranda in their book \"Espadas del Fin del Mundo\" (2016).\n\nIn 1595, Pope Clement VIII created the Diocese of Nueva Segovia and in 1596, the Dominicans accepted it as an ecclesiastical mission. Nueva Segovia had three churches: the cathedral that was under the secular clergy, and the parishes of Centro and Tocolona under the supervision of the Dominicans. But because of its distance from Manila and the constant threat of the Cagayan River's rampaging waters, the Diocese of Nueva Segovia was transferred to Vigan in Ilocos Sur province in 1758. The diocese's name went along with the transfer to Vigan and to avoid confusion, Bishop Miguel Garcia requested that Nueva Segovia and its suburbs renamed back to Lal-lo. The seat of the Diocese of Nueva Segovia remains in Vigan till today where is now elevated as the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia.\n\nThe transfer affected the closure of the cathedral and the merging of the three churches into the single parish of Centro. The two other churches were abandoned and eventually destroyed because of neglect while the church of Centro, dedicated to \"Santo Domingo de Guzman\" (Saint Dominic) became what is now the church of Lal-lo. The remains of three bishops are interred in the church: Bishop Miguel de Benavides who was Nueva Segovia's first bishop and later of Manila where he founded the University of Santo Tomas, Bishop Diego de Soria who was the second bishop of the diocese, and Bishop Diego Aduarte who was the sixth.\n\nLal-lo used to be the capital of Cagayan province until 1839 when the provincial seat of power was relocated to Tuguegarao. The decline of Lal-lo is the transformation of Tuguegarao as the most important town in Cagayan. It was accepted as an ecclesiastical mission by the Dominicans in 1604, 23 years after the foundation of Lal-lo.\n\nResearchers have found a Spanish document which declared this municipality as a city during the Spanish regime, according to board member Maria Olivia Pascual. Pascual said a bill, which clamors for the restoration of the former \"Ciudad Nueva Segovia\" now called Lal-lo filed by 1SR Congressional District Representative Juan Ponce Enrile Jr., will be re-filed.\n\nDuring the first term of Mayor Florante Pascual, he resolved that the cityhood be restored through an earlier bill. However, even after sending a research delegation to Madrid to retrieve the historical document originally signed by King Philip, the team failed to locate it. The document is a basic requirement in the bid of this town for cityhood.\n\nUnder the local government code, municipalities who want to elevate themselves into cities must satisfy requirements on population, land area and income. For municipalities who were earlier declared as Spanish cities, only decrees which declared them as such is the basic requirement. Earlier, the towns of Naga (Nueva Caceres) and Vigan (Ciudad Fernandina) were elevated to cityhood status after both towns applied for their historical rights in the early 1990s. Academics clarified that there is a big difference between restoration and conversion of cities under Philippine laws.\n\nUnder the Diocese of Nueva Segovia, Lal-lo enjoyed lavish gifts from Spain and was the capital of the entire Cagayan Valley region until its transfer to Tuguegarao City in 1839.\n\nAs recently as 2018, vice mayor Oliver Pascual has said that the establishment of Northern Cagayan International Airport in the municipality would be \"a great boost\" in its bid for the restoration of its city status.\n\nIn 2006, the shell-midden sites of Lalo-lo and Gattaran were included in the UNESCO Tentative List for World Heritage Site inclusion, a step closer to becoming a world heritage site. The shell-midden sites are currently being conserved by the local government from looting to preserve its outstanding universal value.\n\nIn the , the population of Lal-lo, Cagayan, was people, with a density of .\n\n\n"}

Abulacan was founded by the ecclesiastical authorities on April 30, 1757 with San Juan Nepomuceno as the patron saint. Sometime in 1842, Vicar Pedro Montenegro, O.P. convinced the people to unite the two towns. The vicar named it \"Pamplona\" in memory of his hometown Pamplona in Spain.\n\nAfter the fusion, an agreement was made that there would be two patron saints of Pamplona: San Juan Nepomuceno and San Pedro de Martir. This is the reason why the town fiesta is celebrated for two days and the images of the two patron saints are carried during religious processions. The town fiesta is celebrated every April 29.\n\nIn 1919, some of the prominent people of Pamplona recommended the transfer of the same to Bidduang, a barrio of Pamplona. The transfer was made on November 16, 1919, during the administration of municipal president Esteban Meneses by order of General Wood. In 1928, on the sixth year of the administration of municipal president Paulino Ifurung, one of his last acts was the transfer of the municipal government back to its old site, Pamplona, by then called \"Albano.\"\n\nMost interesting spot is the mouth of the Pamplona River. It saw history in the making for it was the starting point of Salcedo and his conquistadores when they explored Cagayan in 1572. Because of the river's strong current and unpredictable floods, Mayor Nicolas B. Aquino built in 1955 a concrete levee along Barangay Masi. He also built an irrigation system. It was the first of its kind in Cagayan.\n\nThe town is also noted for its Malagabavi Cave and waterfall. It is located at the foot of a mountain virtually shaped like a pig. Legend has it that this cave was used by a giant as an entrance to his abode.

It is the home of Our Lady of Piat which continues to be the source of inspiration and object of devotion of many Catholics in the region.\n\nThere are quite a few conjectures on how Piat got its name. One has it is that it derives from \"\"piyas\",\" an Ilokano word, in Ibanag \"\"addulu\"\" and in Tagalog, \"\"kamiyas\".\" Another has it that the word comes from \"\"aggapiya\",\" meaning \"healer, masseuse,\" and a more credible version has it that it is derived from the Ibanag and Itawes word \"\"piya\"\" which means \"goodness, kindness, health.\"\n\nThe original people were the Itawes; at present, there are many Ibanag.

Miguel de San Jacinto named Piat as a mission in the Itawes region comprising the towns of Tabang, Malaueg, Tuao and Piat.

It attracts excursionists and vacationists anytime, especially in summer.\n\nRizal is home to Cagayan's legendary figures – Biuag and Malana – who were said to have fought their epic battle for supremacy over the hand of the beautiful \"Maguinganay\" by swapping volleys of uprooted trees and live cattle. Their hangouts, two high mountains and a steep trail called \"escolta\" from where they uprooted trees to hurl at one another, can still be seen in Malaueg (Rizal).\n\nLocal crops are corn, rice and tobacco. It is known before of its specie as \"Matalag\", which means men and women alike to go for its aroma and suaveness. Its bananas and mangoes have become a good source of revenue.\n\nThe incorporation of the town was dated early 1500s during the Spanish era in the Philippines. The name became permanently until 1903 when the town was renamed in the honor of the Philippine National Hero Dr. José Rizal.\n\nDuring the Spanish regime, the town was said to be the rest spots of the Spanish Authorities, friars and some locals, because of its cool environmental climate. Malaueg people build the largest stone convents for the friars, some nipa hut houses for Spanish Authorities and some ordinary houses for the locals. Malaueg became a center of Christianity next to Nueva Segovia after the Malaueg Church was built.\n\nDuring the American occupation of the Philippines, the town of Malaueg was also a favorite spot for the Americans. During the Spanish–American War, the town was almost destroyed when the soldiers used its towering mountains to hide their ammunition and dug some trenches. The Authorities were very protective of the condition of the church during war.\n\nThe town before had two municipalities, namely: Mauanan and Malaueg. The barrios on the western and northern part belonged to the municipality of Malaueg, while the barrios on the eastern part belonged to the municipality of Mauanan, where the seat of two municipal governments was established (Philippine Commission; Act nos. 943,944, 1903). Act no. 2390 changed the names of the municipalities of Santo Nino and Mauanan.\n\nThe names of the municipalities of Santo Nino and Mauanan were changed to Faire and Rizal respectively. Mauanan was named Rizal in the year 1914 and the sitios of Lattut, Capacuaan and Macatal were annexed from Rippang in 1933, under executive Order No. 690 dated March 28, 1935.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, the town was largely destroyed in bombing attacks. The town also became one of the centers of resistance in the Philippines because of its forested areas that served as a hideout.\n\nOn December 3, 2008, elected mayor Raul dela Cruz sustained bullet wounds to the body and died while being taken to the hospital in Tuguegarao City.\n\nMore violence took place on January 23, 2011, during the Town Fiesta, Police Commander Roweko and his wife together with six others were ambushed. \n\nRizal is located north-west of Tuguegarao City, which is from the city.

The road from Tuao to Rizal is rough and can take up to one-half-hours. It will take another half-hour ride from Tuguegarao to Tuao.\n\nThe provincial road was opened in 1951. From 1951 to 1986, one had to cross the Matalag River with a ferry boat made out of bamboos and drum. The ferry boat loaded only one jeep or bus at a time. Traveling to Rizal from Tuao to Tuguegarao or vice versa in those days was slow and tiresome because it took the ferry boat almost an hour to ferry its load to and from the other side of the river.

Some fishermen from Minanga ( a barrio of Gonzaga) came and settled in Palawig. In 1891, Felipe Agarpao with some settlers organized a \"\"gimong\"\" (society) called \"\"Inanama\".\" The purpose of the organisation was to acquire and occupy lands around the place. That same year, Briccio Campañano of Lapog, Ilocos Sur together with some others from Ilocos came to Palawig to apply for homesteads in the sitio of Marede. These settlers organized another \"\"gimong\"\" called \"\"Dagupan\".\"\n\nIn 1900, the woodcutters from Aparri led by Don Julian Astigarraga arrived by the first boat. Thus, began the clearing of settlements.\n\nFrom 1919 to 1935 several group of settlers from the Ilocos Region came to claim lands aboard \"virays\" (light seagoing boats). The once-forested areas were accessible only via rivers and the sea. Before reaching the settlements in the northern and eastern portions, they had to navigate through Palawig River.\n\nThe name Palawig was coined from the local term \"pasawig\", meaning mouth of the river.\n\nIn 1935, the gimongs \"\"Inanama\" and \"Dagupan\"\" fused into one called \"\"Da Inanama\",\" headed by Navarro, they began to work for the separation of Palawig as a municipality independent from Gonzaga. Their application was held in abeyance because their population did not meet the needed number required by law. The move was suspended in 1941 and when World War II broke out the move was not carried out.\n\nBarrio Palawig and its neighbouring barrios were separated from Gonzaga and the town was created by President Elpidio Quirino via Executive Order No. 289 (21 October 1949). Contrary to the usual assumption, it is not named for Saint Anne but is an acronym of the surnames of the then-three provincial officials: Governor Nicasio Arranz; and Provincial Board members Federico Navarro; and Roberto Avena. The association to the saint was a back-formation in keeping with traditional Hispanicised toponyms.\n\nIn the , the population of Santa Ana, Cagayan, was people, with a density of .\n\nSanta Ana is a mix of agricultural, commercial and agricultural economy. Most of the commercial and industrial activities are at Port Irene as the Cagayan Special Economic Zone in Barangay Casambalangan.\n\nSome of its agricultural and aquatic products are rice, corn, peanut, fish, lumber, shells, etc. Among its natural resources are limestone deposits at Bawac Mountain, coal at Carbon Mountain, Santa Clara and guano deposit at Kapannikian Cave.\n\nAside from the Cagayan Special Economic Zone which host casinos and other gaming facilities, scenic spots and historical landmarks are present in this town. These include:\n\nSanta Ana is the Game Fishing hub of the Philippines. It has hosted international decathlons, where athletes run through the rugged terrain of Punta Verde to Cape Engaño, then dipped in the crystal clear water of the Philippine Sea.\n\nSanta Ana is also known as one of the sites for Kiteboarding and Windsurfing. In 2015, the Philippine Windsurfing Association and the Philippine Kiteboarding Association organized a Kiteboarding and Windsurfing competition in Anguib Beach, known as the paradise for kiteboarders and windsurfers.\n\nIn 2016, Beach Volleyball Republic hosts the third leg of the Nationwide On Tour, also in Anguib Beach. Beach volleybelles Charo Soriano, who is a native from Tuguegarao, and Filipino-American Alexa Micek won the third leg of the BVR On Tour.\n\nEvery May 26 to May 30 of the year, the town plays host to the \"Viray Festival\", organized by the local government with the support of the regional tourism office and the private sector. Launched in June 2005, the Viray Festival was conceptualized to dramatize the significance of the viray, which played a key role in the lives and history of the town.\n\nA viray is a large wooden flat boat which, before the use of gasoline-fed engines in the early 1950s, was propelled by sails. Comerciantes (traders) used large virays measuring long, wide and high. Fishermen, on the other hand, used smaller ones, usually long, wide and high. Equipped with oars to reach nearby fishing grounds, these types sailed for longer distances.\n\nDue to its capacity to carry great quantities of cargo, viray was the only means of transport used by the first settlers of Santa Ana.\n\nLeaders and well-off families derived income from the services of the viray ranging from fishing operation, commerce and trade to means of transport during the years when Santa Ana was at its prime. Used for \"daklis\" (trawl net), \"sapiao\" (net) and \"sirut\" (ring net) fishing, viray could carry the fishing gears, provisions, supplies, and manpower. It is assisted by small bancas during the fishing operation.\n\nAn annual fluvial parade of colorful boats is held during the first day.\n\nThe second day of the festival features a grand carabao parade where each of the 16 barangays composing the municipality has their turn to show off their artistic talents.\n\nOn the third day, local folks and visitors alike line up along the main street to watch colorful bodies participating in the street dancing competition.\n\n"}

It has a longer wet season, unlike most parts of the country that enjoy almost equal periods of wet and dry seasons. The wet season normally starts in the last week of May and lasts up to the end of January. It is during the later months of this season that the famous \"gamet\" or \"nori\" grows along its rocky seacoast. The dry season starts by the end of January till the end of May.\n\nSanta Praxedes is politically subdivided into 10 barangays.\n\n\nThe town's original name was Langangan, then changed to Santa Praxedes, after the second-century martyr of the same name, by virtue of Republic Act No. 4149 in 1964. The first settlers were known to be the emigrants from the neighboring provinces of Ilocos Sur (from the municipalities of Sinait and Magsingal) and Ilocos Norte (from the municipalities of Pasuquin, Badoc and Pinili).\n\nThere has also been past and present moves by the municipal council to regain political control of some barangays of the neighboring municipality of Claveria, particularly the barangays of Cadcadir, Lablabig, Mabnang, Union, Kilkiling and Siam-Siam.

Currently, the local government is further developing both Portabaga Falls and Mingay Beach Resorts.

It flapped its wings noisily, cried \"\"battuao, battuao, battuao\"\" and then flew away.\n\nThe native laborers in the construction stopped working and refused to continue telling the priests that the site had not been well chosen. They insisted that a party should find out where the bird had flown to.\n\nTo humor the pagan natives, one of the priests allowed himself to be led by a party of natives to look for the mysterious bird. To his surprise, they found the bird serenely perched on top of a tall tree on the edge of a wide clearing ideal for a town site. He sent one of the natives to call for the other priests, who, on their arrival, found the place much to their liking. And so the first church of Tuao was constructed on the site where the present edifice now stands.\n\nWhen the civil authorities founded the town in 1604, the natives insisted that it be called Tuao. Eight years later on May 13, 1612, Tuao was accepted ecclesiastically. Father Miguel de San Jacinto, O.P. gave the town Santos Angeles Custudios (Holy Guardian Angels) as its patron saints.\n\nThe early missionaries in Tuao were zealous evangelists and tactful pacifiers of warlike natives. One of them was Father Francisco Capillas who later became the first martyr in China. The first parish priest, Father Juan B. Cano, O.P. worked patiently with the people.\n\nA late comer, Father Gabriel Serrano, O.P. built a strong brick and mortar church, a rectory (convento) and a fort (cotta) in which the Spaniards and the natives sought refuge every time the town was raided by the Kalingas from the Caraballo ranges. Unfortunately, these priceless monuments to the politicalization and evangelization of Tuao by the Spaniards were destroyed by a strong earthquake on December 29, 1749.\n\nIn protest of abuses committed by some Spanish civil petty officials and soldiers, the inhabitants of Tuao and neighboring Malaueg, rose in revolt in 1781 under Magtangaga and Tomas Sinaguingan. The uprising was put down by Capitan Juan Pablo de Orduna.\n\nTuao became a part of events during World War II as the seat of the successful renaissance government of Governor Marcelo Adduru.

During the Spanish regime, the city is a part of the Tobacco industry. Cauayan City is nearly the geographic center of the province and bordered by 7 neighboring towns which makes it as an important economic center of the province. In the recent years, there is an increase in economic activities.\n\nCauayan City is a fast-growing rural industrial center centrally located in the province and in the entire stretch out of Cagayan Valley. It is about 375 kilometers northeast Manila; 34.5 kilometers south of Ilagan, the capital city of Isabela; about 48 kilometers north Santiago City; and roughly 117 kilometers away from Tuguegarao City in Cagayan Province.\n\nCauayan have its name from the word \"Kawayan\" meaning bulo in the Ilocano language, the early settlers of the place. How it got its name is vaguely told by the natives. In the tale, early Spaniards reached the place found abundant bamboo trees along creeks that circled the town site of Bulod, Sipat, Bungkol, and Marabulig creeks where few families lived. It was also a common to see crocodiles basking under the cluster of bamboo along the creeks in the early morning sun.\n\nAnother version of how the town was named is this way: One day the miraculous image of the Blessed Virgin Mary disappeared. For many weeks, a tireless search was undertaken but it was nowhere to be found. Then one day in October the image was found among the bamboo groves. Not a single sign of mishandling or scratch was detected on the image.\n\nCauayan used to be a big municipality in terms of land area. With the creation of the neighboring municipalities of Luna (Antatet) Cabatuan, Reina Mercedes (Callering), Aurora and San Mateo, however, the land area was reduced to about 336.40 square kilometers.\n\nThe original inhabitants (as recorded by the Dominican vicar of Ilagan, Father dela Torre, who explored the area in 1736) were Gaddang. Cauayan town was once a part of the province of Cagayan. When Nueva Vizcaya was created as a province in 1839, Cauayan was transferred to it. On May 1, 1856, the province of Isabela was created by a Royal Decree, Cauayan was again administratively transferred, this time to Isabela. Founded in 1740, Cauayan antedates the establishment of Isabela by 116 years. The town site was first located in a place called Calanusian along the Cagayan River. After a series of disastrous floods, the town site was moved to its present location.\n\nCauayan City is politically subdivided into 65 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Cauayan, Isabela, was people, with a density of .\n\nCauayan is a third class city in the province of Isabela. Cauayan City has been selected to host the Proposed Isabela Special Economic Zone and the Regional Agro-Industrial Growth Center. There are over 2,422 commercial establishments that include distributors, wholesalers and retailers.\n\nCauayan city is a surplus producer of rice and corn. A total of 24,004 hectares or 69.9% hectares is utilized for palay production and corn production. Average yield per hectare per cropping is 4.5 MT for rice and corn. Other products include livestock and poultry, fruits and vegetables, and fishery products such as hito (cat fish) and tilapia. The National Irrigation Administration has an office in the city.\n\nAs of the year December 31, 2015, Cauayan has a total of 30 banks, with a total volume of bank deposits at Php 17.5 billion. There are six banks based in the city namely PR Bank (Philippine Resources Savings Bank), FICO Bank (First Isabela Cooperative Bank), Rural Bank of Cauayan, North Pacific Banking Corp., Common Wealth Rural Bank Inc., and Golden Rural Bank of the Philippines. PR Bank is the largest of this six with 46 branches all over the Philippines, second is FICO Bank with 31 branches all within in Luzon, and third is Rural Bank of Cauayan with 19 branches all within the Cagayan Valley. PR Bank is the 15th largest thrift bank in the Philippines in terms of assets at 9.6 Php billion.\n\nRecently, SM Prime opened a new mall in Cauayan City, the SM City Cauayan is situated in District II, National highway, Cauayan City, the former site of Isabela Colleges. SM City Cauayan is the first SM Supermall in Region II which caters at least 1 million residents of the province and neighboring states. SM City Cauayan is the first non-premier SM Supermall to offer Al-fresco malling experience, tapping the clean and fresh air that the city has to offer.\n\nSM City Cauayan also delivers new stores, national and international brands, giving Cauayan City and other neighboring towns and cities the opportunity to experience high-end shopping on a vibrant and elegant environment—and most notably is the Japanese clothing line Uniqlo. The Cauayan, Isabela branch of UniQlo is the first in Northern Luzon. KFC, Kenny Rogers,and Max's Restaurant are also expected to open a branch in SM City Cauayan, the companies's first stores in Cagayan Valley. Puregold, a large retail chain in the Philippines, is currently operating two supermarkets in Cauayan. Some notable local shopping centers such as Talavera Square Mall and Primark Town Center Cauayan, which opened in June 2016, has continued to take a significant part of the local commerce industry.\n\nSmall Restaurants also made their part to the industry like Kinomo Restaurant, Hap Chan, and is located at San Fermin, Cauayan City.\n\nBig real estate developers like Vista Land and Lifescapes, Inc. also entered the city with the opening of Camella Cauayan and Lumina Cauayan\n\nGawagaway-yan Festival of Cauayan City is a celebration of the city's bountiful livelihood and merriment for the ethno-linguistic groups residing in Cauayan. It also traces and gives due recognition to the ancestry of Cauayenos from the ethno linguistic group called Gaddang and recognizes the diversity of the cultural groups residing in Cauayan City through streetdancing, float parade and other indigenous activities.\n\nCauayan traces its roots to the people of Gaddang, who the city celebrates during the annual festival of Gawagaway-yan. This celebration features a street dance competition, a float parade and assorted activities that different ethno-linguistic groups participate in.\n\nIts ease at growing mushrooms has established Cauayan as the “Mushroom City of the North.” Do not leave the city without visiting the Mushroom Center and trying the delicious local mushrooms cooked in a delightfully unfamiliar way, like tempura, sisig and lumpia.\n\nThe city was once tobacco land, and there are still reminders of this past at the Old Tabacalera Warehouse, known as Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas during the Spanish period. This local tobacco industry was a massive enterprise going all the way back to 1881, when it first started supplying the Tobacco Monopoly of the Spanish government. The old Tabacalera Warehouse is part of Hacienda San Luis, an eco-tourism park in the city.\n\nAside from the majestic view of Cagayan river from the 250m long and 30 ft high zip line, Hacienda San Luis is a home for cultural heritage. Museo San Luis features how tobaccos are made for the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade. It also showcases sculptures of St. Luis (Louis) and several masterpieces.\n\nIn Cauayan City, there is a difference in the adequacy of infrastructure facilities in urban and rural areas. Generally, the closer the area is to the main service center of the city, i.e. the Poblacion, the better are the facilities for production and distribution of goods and services. The analysis in this sector is based on the existing infrastructure facilities and those considered in the pipeline for 2002–2006 implementation. No projects are as yet programmed beyond 2006 in higher levels of government.\n\nThe existing infrastructure Provision for Transport of Cauayan City is shown in Table 41. The city has a total of 512.27 kilometers of roads. Roads are classified into national, provincial, municipal/city and barangay roads including NIA access roads. All of the 18.16 kilometers of national roads are concrete roads while more than two-thirds of the 42.904 kilometers of Provincial roads are graveled and 17.86 kilometers of city roads are concrete roads, about 97.40% or 340.16 kilometers of barangay roads are gravel roads while the 56.40 kilometers of NIA access road is only 2.22% concrete. By type of pavement, the total of 512.27 kilometers of roads in the city, only 12.37% or 63.322 kilometers is concrete and 87.68% is graveled accounting to 448.948 kilometers. However, all settlement areas are provided with roads.\n\nThe national roads allow the operation of various bus and jeepney operators in the City of Cauayan and neighboring towns and areas to transport passengers and cargo to any point of Luzon, making the City of Cauayan one of the transport pivotal points in the Cagayan Valley.\n\nThe 18.16 kilometers of national roads in the City of Cauayan provide mobility and access to the neighboring towns, provinces and regions. This road is the Cagayan Valley Road (CVR). The CVR is the Cagayan Valley section of the Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway, also known as the Maharlika Highway.\n\nThe CVR from Alinam to Tagaran is the city's longest stretch of concrete road. This road links the City of Cauayan to the rest of the region, to Region 03 and National Capital Region in the south and to Region 01 in the north.\n\nThe proposed Cauayan City Diversion Roads include the Minante I- Marabulig-I – Dadap (Mun. of Luna) – San Fermin – Tagaran with an approximate length of 12..5 kilometers; the Alicaocao – Turayong – District II – Labinab – District I – Minante I Diversion Road (4.8 km); and the San Fermin – Tagaran via CRAIGC (4.2 km) These Diversion Roads when constructed will improve the settlements, the movement of goods and services and even the flow of traffic in the city. The estimated construction cost for these tree (3) projects will reach PhP 119.5 million including drainage and 4 bridges.\n\nOf the 59.66 kilometers of provincial roads, only 28.09% or 16.756 kilometers are concrete and the rest are all gravel roads constituting 42.904 kilometers accounting to about 71.91%.\n\nApproximately 61.3% of city streets or 17.860 kilometers are concrete while 38.70% or 10.950 kilometers are gravel roads. In order for business to flourish in the poblacion, all city streets need to be concreted within the plan period.\n\nOf the total 512.27 kilometers of roads within Cauayan, about 11.01% or an aggregate length of 56.40 kilometers is NIA access roads constructed and maintained by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA). However, in 1997, NIA turned over these roads to the city government for maintenance.\n\nThe barangay roads are important as they provide mobility and access in the settlement areas. With each new settlement area, barangay roads are initiated with private homeowners’ efforts, provided the road is donated to the government, for concreting and maintenance. The government later on augments the private road development.\n\nBarangay roads totals 349.24 kilometers or 68.17% of the total 512.27 kilometers of roads in the city. Of this length, 97.40% or 340.16 kilometers are graveled. Only about 9.080 kilometers or 2.60% are concrete.\n\nThe provision of heavy equipment necessary in the construction and maintenance of roads and other infrastructure facilities and utilities is of high importance in order for the city government to enhance mobility thereby increasing productivity.\n\nThe standards for road provision are 2.40 kilometers for every 1,000 urban population and 1.50 kilometers for every 100 hectares of arable land in the rural areas. Presently, the rural road density (km/km²) is placed at 1.52 topping the list in the entire province in terms of rural road density. With 35.575 kilometers of roads in the 5 barangays with a CY 2000 population of 31,037, the city of Cauayan has an urban road density of only 0.872 kilometers per 1,000 urban populations. Additional roads must be constructed in the poblacion to hasten development. On the other hand, it has 313.665 kilometers in the 60 rural barangays with 23,501.21 hectares of arable land. This means a road density of only 1.33 kilometers for every 100 hectares of arable lands in the rural barangays. This implies that more roads have to be constructed in the rural barangays to fully support socio-economic development.\n\nThe city's road network includes 20 permanent bridges, 6 of which are reinforced concrete deck girder (RCDG) bridges. \"Thirteen concrete overflow bridges\" and \"one steel bridge\" account for a total aggregate length of 431.5 lineal meters. Two RCDG bridges along the Maharlika highway have recently been replaced under the Tulay ng Pangulo Program of then President Fidel Ramos and were inaugurated in 1999 by no less than President Joseph Estrada. However, The Alicaocao Overflow Bridge spanning 66 meters was hit by disastrous flood in 1998 causing the bridge to collapse particularly at the Carabbatan Chica portion. Replacement of the said bridge is crucial to the development of the other side of the Cagayan River since this is the only route going to that place except when you take Naguilian Bridge via Minanga in the municipality of Naguilian, which is a tormentous stretch aside from causing delay. Several overflow bridges within the city also needs immediate replacement and around 16 bridges and 18 RCCP culverts more need to be constructed/replaced in order to make the city road network system efficient.\n\nCauayan road network is supported with privately owned terminals for jeeps and buses located at Barangay San Fermin. SM City Cauayan has built a terminal beside the mall to support the public transportation in/out of the Cauayan.\n\n\nAn inter-provincial bus terminal with an estimated cost of PHP 70.00 million needs to be constructed in this rapidly urbanizing city to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the city's transportation system and to provide additional prime commercial area and needed tourism support services.\n\nThe city airport located at Barangay San Fermin completes the infrastructure provision for transport for the city of Cauayan with provincial and regional impact. It is a secondary airport as per BAT classification. The airport runway has a total length of 2,500 meters and 30 meters wide capable of accommodating Boeing 737s. It is equipped with VHF Omni Range Transmitter, VHF Air/Ground single band radio and provided with fire-fighting equipment and facilities. It is likewise provided with facilities for arriving and departing passengers. The entire airport facility is provided with a perimeter fence.\n\nAt present, the facility is undergoing upgrading of facilities intended to accommodate international cargo flights. When completed, it is also expected that normal operations of the Philippine Airlines will resume which is very crucial in the commerce and industry sector of the city. This is very timely since Cauayan City has been selected to host the Proposed Isabela Special Economic Zone and the Regional Agro-Industrial Growth Center.\n\nCebu Pacific Air fly in Cauayan daily utilizing an Airbus A320 aircraft with Flight No. 5J 196 departing from Manila and Flight No. 5J 197 departing from Cauayan City.\n\nCommunications facilities include PLDT, DIGITEL, PILTEL, BAYANTEL, RCPI, PT&T, BUTEL, Globe, Smart and Sun Cellular Communications. Philpost, LBC, JRS Express, FedEx, DCI Express, and EXL Express move mails. Broadcast media is provided by 5 FM and 2 AM station, a cable TV facility while a number of Internet Café have established their operations in the city. Nowadays, the most important means of communication with relatives and friends is thru internet. This was being provided by the NSCV internet connections plus the MYDSL and SmartBro broadband. The LGU likewise is utilizing handheld radio transceivers covering all barangays in city and the province as well with bases at the city hall, city police and fire protection offices.\n\nThe health needs of the city is served by a district hospital and 5 private hospitals; RHU-1 & RHU-2, 22 BHS, a puericulture Center, 13 private medical clinics, 11 private dental clinics, a rehabilitation center for the disabled, and the Cauayan Microscopy Center. These medical facilities has a total of 255 beds. Health personnel includes 41 medical doctors, 16 dentist, 74 nurses, 84 midwives, 10 medical technicians, 7 sanitary inspectors, 7 paramedics, 250 Barangay Health Workers and 148 Community Volunteer Health Workers both in the public and private sector.\n\nThe City Schools Division of Cauayan has a total 64 public and 14 private elementary schools, eight public and seven private secondary schools, two universities and four private colleges.\n\nColleges:\nHigh schools:\nElementary schools:\n13. https://web.archive.org/web/20141006113021/http://itsmorefuninthephilippines.com/cauayan-city/ Retrieved October 4, 2014\n\n14. http://cityofcauayan.gov.ph Retrieved October 4, 2014\n\n"}

At the time of his death, he was the 38th richest French citizen.\n\nÉdouard Stern was born in 1954 to one of France's wealthiest families, the owners of the private investment house Banque Stern. His father, Antoine Jean Stern is a descendant of a notable family of bankers, going back to 19th-century Frankfurt, and his mother was Christiane Laroche, former wife of French journalist and politician Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber. He is the great grandson of .\n\nKeen to follow in his father's footsteps, Stern graduated from the Ecole Supérieure des Sciences Economiques et Commerciales (ESSEC Business School) in Paris with a degree in finance before joining the family's private investment house in 1977.\n\nAged 22, Stern took the reins of Banque Stern with a clear mandate to revitalize the nearly bankrupt institution. During the 1980s, Stern revamped the bank, expanding its activity in financial markets, as well as in mergers and acquisitions. In 1985, Stern sold the bank for 300 million francs ($60 million in 2005 dollars) to Lebanese investors. Thanks to a clause attached to the contract, Stern got to keep the copyright over his last name. Immediately after the sale went through, Stern started a new bank, with a similar name and business profile, drawing in many of his former clients. He sold this second institution for an estimated 1.75 billion francs in 1988 to the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBS, which will later merge with UBS to form UBS S.A.). As a result of these transactions, Stern shot up the ranks of the richest families in France, occupying the 38th spot, according to Forbes.\n\nIn 1992, he joined Lazard Frères as managing partner and quickly became one of the firm's star bankers and heir-apparent. He tried to reduce overhead and bring in younger partners but clashed with Michel David-Weill, the bank's head and his father-in-law. He quit Lazard Frères in 1997 and set up his own investment fund, Investment Real Returns (IRR). He owned half and the remainder was held by Eurazeo, a Lazard holding company and Mainz Holdings Ltd., a U.S. Virgin Islands firm that Stern wholly owned. He maintained cordial relations with David-Weill, who invested $300 million in IRR.\n\nIn 2000, Stern bought shares in the London-based Delta PLC, an international engineering group that was revising its corporate strategy. His stake eventually increased to 26% and after applying considerable pressure, he was named non-executive chairman on 31 December 2003. In October 2003, Stern sued Rhodia, alleging false accounting and insider dealing.After Stern's death, Delta was taken over by the US company, Valmont. \n\nDuring his almost three decade long career, Stern amassed a fortune of more than a $1 billion through a series of \"often brilliant business deals\". His banking style was considered revolutionary for France's so-called \"cozy capitalism\", as Stern honed his skill at engineering hostile takeovers.\n\nOn 28 February 2005 Stern was found dead in his apartment in Geneva, his body riddled with bullets. He was found in the bedroom, in a flesh-coloured head-to-toe latex suit. Swiss authorities arrested his long-time lover, Cécile Brossard, over the killing. Brossard, 40, was convicted and on 18 June 2009 was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison. In addition, the Swiss court ordered Brossard to pay Stern's children one Swiss franc for \"moral damage\". \"The Wall Street Journal\" has reported that \"Stern's family hopes people will stop talking about the case\".\n\nCécile Brossard was freed on parole in November 2010, after spending five years in detention (including four years while awaiting trial. In 2013, Cécile Brossard talked about the murder for the first time since the trial, confessing that she \"eternally regrets\" her actions and she misses her lover, who had \"a lovely and luminous personality\".\n\nThe French film \"\"Une Histoire d'Amour<nowiki>\"</nowiki>\". (titled in English 'Tied') is a direct telling of the story, although the ending there could imply death by dehydration during the Mistress' long plane flight rather than by (a blank) gunshot.\nThe story of Édouard Stern is cited as the inspiration for Olivier Assayas' 2008 film \"Boarding Gate\".\nThe death of Édouard Stern was directly parodied on the FX animated series \"Archer\" in the third season episode \"Lo Scandalo\".\n\nIn 1983, Édouard Stern married Béatrice David-Weill, the daughter of Michel David-Weill, president of Lazard Frères. The couple divorced in 1998. Stern is survived by three children. In 1997, Stern became romantically linked to Julia Lemigova, former Miss USSR 1990 with whom he had a son, Maxmillian, who died as an infant under suspicious circumstances. In 2000, Stern became involved with Cecile Brossard.\n\nStern was known for his eccentric life style. He was very close to former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. He was a notorious gourmand, once reportedly eating seventy pieces of sushi in one sitting.\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nFormerly known as Pueblo de Carig during the time of the Spanish, it is located between southwestern part of Isabela and northwestern boundary of Quirino in Northeastern Luzon island of the Philippines. It is the gateway to the vast plains of Cagayan Valley.\n\nSantiago is situated north of Metro Manila. The city sits on a vast area of predominantly flat and fertile land in the Cagayan Valley, surrounded by the Caraballo Mountains to the south, the Great Sierra Madre to the east and the Cordillera Mountain Range to the west alongside the Magat River.\n\nThough statistically grouped by the Philippine Statistics Authority and geographically located within the boundaries of the province of , as well as part of the province's 4th District, Santiago City is administratively and legally independent from the province as stated in Section 25 of the LGC.\n\nThe origin of Santiago City can be drawn from the first native settlement discovered by the early Spanish missionaries at the bank of the old Carig River (now Diadi River) from which its original name, Carig, was derived. The early inhabitants were the Gaddangs and the Ibanags. When the Spanish settled in, the city was named Pueblo of Santiago Apostol de Carig, with Santiago as the Spanish name of Saint James the Apostle. In the early 1950s, the Municipal President Vicente Carreon changed the name to simply Santiago. Santiago remained a municipality for 84 years.\n\nSantiago was originally a part of the province Cagayan (comprising the whole Cagayan Valley region), which was reorganized as a political subdivision in 1583 with Nueva Segovia as its capital. On May 1, 1856, when the province of Isabela was carved out by a Royal Decree, Santiago was among the towns relinquished to the newly created province. The first five barrios after the Cadastral survey in 1927 were Patul, Batal, Nabbuan, Buenavista and Dubinan.\n\nIt was said that there were only about three Filipino-owned sari-sari stores in Santiago in 1917. The settlers acquired most of their merchandise and other provisions from Chinese traders in Echague, the landing zone for products intended for Santiago and other towns, owing to its proximity to the Cagayan River.\n\nIt was when the Villa-Verde Trail was opened when things were set in motion. It facilitated the entry of immigrants from various provinces in Luzon to the Cagayan Valley and Santiago absorbed a sizable share of these travelers. The new route served as an impetus for growth and introduced new technologies and business opportunities, and made Santiago a melting pot of different cultures.\n\nIn 1942, during World War II, the Japanese forces entered and occupied the town of Santiago. In 1945, the town was liberated by the Filipino soldiers of the 1st, 2nd, 12th, 13th and 15th Infantry Division and the USAFIP-NL 11th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, the 1st Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and the recognized guerrilla fighter units.\n\nSantiago survived through world wars, although badly damaged, and from then on developed to become the leading trading and commercial city in Cagayan Valley.\n\nOn December 17, 1993, the bill converting Santiago into an independent component city was approved by the Lower House spearheaded by the then Mayor Jose \"Pempe\" Miranda. In the following year, the Senate Committee on Local Government approved another public hearing dated February 23, 1994.\n\nOn May 5, 1994, by virtue of Republic Act 7720 signed by President Fidel V. Ramos, Santiago was pronounced as an independent component city, the first in the Cagayan Valley Region. This made Santiago self-governing and independent from the province of Isabela. Republic Act 8528 repealed this statute transforming it to a component city. It was not until December 29, 1999, when the Supreme Court contested the validity of the latter decision and favored Santiago to be once again an independent component city.\n\nThe total land area the city is 80% flat or nearly level land in the portions of northwestern, eastern and western parts of the city. While adjacent areas have gently undulating and moderately rolling areas, and the remaining areas constitute steeply undulating and rolling lands. The Dariuk Hills is the highest point in the city.\n\nThe geographic coordinate of the city lies between 16º35’00” to 16º47’30” north latitude and 121º25’00” to 121º37’00” east longitude.\n\nThe city has a climate with no pronounced wet or dry season. Usually, the city has a considerably dry climate with minimum rainfall. The average yearly temperature is measured at . Annual and daily temperature variation is minimal. Temperature ranges are usually from .\n\nThe dominant religion in the city is Roman Catholic (Saint James the Apostle Parish in Barangay Centro West and Saint Francis of Assisi Parish in Barangay Rizal). However, other Christian sectors are also present in Santiago such as Iglesia ni Cristo, United Methodist Church, Pentecostal Missionary Church of Christ (4th Watch), Jesus is Lord Church, Christ the Rock Church and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Being a hurried district full of different cultures, such as Indians, Muslim, and Chinese, several religious groups have also opened their places of worship to the public, such as Chinese Temple, the Muslim Mosque, and the Sikh Temple.\n\nHome of several business enterprises, banking institutions, educational entities, as well as manufacturing companies, Santiago City is considered the Commercial and Trading Center of Cagayan Valley and tagged as the Investment Hub of the North.\n\nRobinsons Land Corporation has launched Robinsons Place Santiago as its pioneer mall in Cagayan Valley. Vista Land and Lifescapes, Inc. built its first horizontal subdivision in the Valley with Camella Isabela Communities, Inc. In 2013, it launched another project named Camella Santiago. In 2018, Camella Santiago expanded and named as Camella Santiago Trails. It is building its banner mall in the Cagayan Valley Region, the Vista Mall Santiago. Another multi-national real estate developer will soon be built its prime subdivision, Primeworld Suburb, owned by Primeworld land holdings Company. The head-office of Grupo Marilens, the largest homegrown corporation in the region, is in Santiago City. Aljay, an agri-chemical company, has a presence in the city and has a manufacturing plant for agrichemical, fertilizer and feeds supply for poultry and piggery and the only manufacturing plant for fertilizer and agrichemical in the region. Three of the biggest TV networks in the country (i.e.ABS-CBN, GMA7, TV5) stationed their regional networks and relay stations in the city. San Miguel Corp., Pepsi Cola, Purefoods, Digitel and PLDT also operate in the city while different car companies abound(i.e. Mitsubishi, Nissan, Hyundai, KIA, Ford, Chevrolet, Peugeot, Foton, Mahindra and other car companies as well as Yamaha and Honda Motors). The National Food Authority competes with local traders to stabilize prices.\n\nSantiago City houses some of the biggest hospitals in the region.

The Southern Isabela Medical Center is the biggest public hospital while Flores Memorial Hospital and Medical Center is the oldest in the city. Santiago City also has Renmar Specialists' Hospital, which is a specialty hospital for complicated cases of pulmonology and orthopedics. Santiago Medical City is the latest addition. The city's location is key to the growth of smaller hospitals like Renmar Hospital and Corado Hospital.\n\nBased on the 2016 City Competitiveness Index, Santiago is the fastest growing local economy in the entire Philippines and is now ranked 51 in terms of economy size among all cities in the country.\n\nDespite rapid industrialization, agriculture is still the main source of livelihood. The main crops are rice, corn, and high-value fruits and vegetables. The city is where imposing grain stations can be found. Rice mills abound. It is the pivotal place for crops where harvests from Ifugao, Kalinga, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, and parts of Isabela are transported either to Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Pangasinan or Batangas. In addition to the city's product is muscovado sugar which the local government has been promoting for export.\n\nDuring the Miranda Flagship, the city Government adopted the parental AxR Hybrid rice seed production as its flagship program for agriculture, which produces the offspring F1 Hybrid rice seed. This rice variety makes a phenomenal yield of 249 per ha. doubling the income of Santiago City farmers per cropping, and is expected to bring Santiago City over 2 billion in income and also additional taxes of 17 million and the national government of 33 million per year.\n\nAfter the previous leadership, The Navarro Administration added more life in culture and strengthen the livelihood of the people. The Navarros' spearheaded a unique program for farmers in planting on mid-summer and harvest by early September side by side in focusing on high-value fruits.\n\nThe city is governed by a mayor-council system. There are ten city councilors. The council is the official governing body of the city, also known as the Sanguniang Panglungsod. The council agenda is presided over by the city vice mayor. Being an independent-component city with its own charter, the city is not subject to the jurisdiction of Isabela province, of which it is geographically a part. It is however represented in the Philippine Congress as part of Isabela's 4th legislative district. No native was ever elected mayor of Santiago since the Philippine became a Commonwealth and Republic.\n\nSantiago City is politically subdivided into 37 barangays.\n\nThe majority of the population speaks Tagalog and Ilocano. English is the medium of instruction in schools and is generally understood and spoken especially in the business community.\n\nTourism is a new industry in the city. Serving as the jump-off point in northeastern Luzon for tourists, many landmarks are developed. Tourist spots near Santiago are Quirino Province, Magat Dam in Isabela, Banaue Rice Terraces in Cordillera, and white sand beaches in Aurora Province facing the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\nSantiago City is the gateway to the plains of Cagayan Valley. It connects several provinces with the following major roads crossing the city:\n\n\n\nServing as a bridge to the region's provincial network, numerous bus terminals are present in the city. These include, Victory Liner, Northeast Luzon Bus Line (formerly Nelbusco), GV Florida Transport, Five Star Bus Company, EMC LBS bus lines, GMW trans (Santiago-Laoag-Vigan-Abra via Cagayan province among others. By air via Cauayan Airport.\n\nThe Integrated Transport Terminal and Commercial Complex has also been established to cater for all public utility jeepneys, buses, and vans that operate from nearby provinces and localities to the city. Additional to city transport is the taxi, first in the city and whole Region 2.\n\nNotable school institutions located in the city are the School of Saint James the Apostle (formerly La Salette Elementary School), Santiago Cultural Institute (Chinese School), Children First School, Infant Jesus Montessori School, AMA Computer College Santiago City Campus, TAPS, Patria Sable Corpus College, University of La Salette and Northeastern College, one of the oldest schools in the region.

Farming is its major livelihood and rice its major product and resource.\n\nAlicia is politically subdivided into 34 barangays:\nAlicia was once called \"Angadanan Viejo\" (which means \"Old Angadanan\") when the new Angadanan was relocated in 1776 to its current location near the Angadanan Creek.\n\nThe old Angadanan town was part of the Cagayan Valley province. The entire Cagayan Valley was one large province which the Spaniards called La Provincia del Valle de Cagayan, but divided into two new provinces in 1839 by the Spanish conquistadors. One retained the old name Cagayan which comprised all towns from Aparri to Tumauini; while a new province of Nueva Vizcaya was created composed of all towns from Ilagan City to the Caraballo del Sur including Catalangan, Angadanan (now Alicia), and Palanan, with Camarag (Echague) as its capital.\n\nA Royal Decree was created on 1 May 1856 creating Isabela de Luzon to distinguish it from other Isabelas in the Philippines. It comprised the town of Carig (now Santiago City), Camarag (now Echague), Angadanan (now Alicia), Cauayan, Calanusian (now Reina Mercedes), Gamu, and Ilagan City, all detached from Nueva Vizcaya; while Tumauini and Cabagan were taken from the Cagayan province. It was placed under the jurisdiction of a governor with the capital seat at Ilagan City, where it remains at the present.\n\nWhen then Philippine President Elpidio Quirino signed Executive Order No. 268 on 28 September 1949, the Old Angadanan was renamed and created the municipality of Alicia in honor of then Quirino's wife, Dona Alicia Syquia Quirino, who was murdered by the Japanese during the Japanese occupation.\n\nIn the , the population of Alicia, Isabela, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe population is a combination of different ethnic group dominated by Ilocano speaking people which make Ilocano the common language used in the municipality.\n\nAlicia, as a suburb of a progressive city, Cauayan, Isabela, is also showing signs of progress. Various banking institutions like Landbank of the Philippines, Security Bank, etc. are already present in Alicia. In 2013, popular fast food chain Jollibee has opened its first branch in Alicia which includes Drive Thru service.\n\nThe Our Lady of Atocha Church in Alicia is known for having an old Spanish church architecture. It is one of the best churches to visit for a pilgrimage in the Philippines during the Holy Week. The church was declared by the Philippine Department of Tourism as one of the national religious tourist attractions in the Philippines.\n\nThe structure of the church was original built by the Spaniards in the 18th century, but not finished. Passing by Angadanan town on 12 February 1805, Fr. Manuel Mora, OP wrote that \"Angadanan has a convent of bricks, though not totally finished. Its church is timber, wood, and bamboo. The number of inhabitants is 791.\" The church and convent as seen today in the town of Alicia, beautiful and antique, was built by Fr. Tomas Calderon, OP and inaugurated in 1849, with Fr. Francisco Gainza, OP, then vicar of Carig (now Santiago City). The church was dedicated to the Nuestra Señora de Atocha, more popularly known today as Our Lady of Atocha. The church is known for its antique Castilian architectural design and can be found along the Maharlika Highway and is accessible by land transport.\n\nThe Catholic churches in Alicia, Gamu, and Cauayan City, are examples of what is called as the \"Cagayan Style\" of Spanish churches that was inspired by the Tuguegarao church.\n\nThe municipality of Alicia belonging to the Third Legislative District of the province of Isabela is governed by a municipal mayor and a municipal council. \nThe first municipal mayor of the town was Glicerio Acosta who was appointed to office by the President of the Philippines upon the creation of Alicia as a municipality in 1949. The mayor and other elective officials are restricted to three (3) consecutive terms, totaling nine (9) years, although a mayor can be elected again after an interruption of one (1) term.\n\nAlicia has two universities that cater to the people of the municipality and other neighboring municipalities and provinces. Alicia is also noted for having the most high-tech school in the region.\n\n\nPrivate:\n\nPublic:\n\nPrivate:\n\nPublic:\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nCabagan had been the business center of three nearby towns (Santa Maria, San Pablo and Santo Tomas) before they had their own market. It is locally known for its \"pancit Cabagan\". Its people are called Ybanags. Nowadays, Ybanags are well educated and the source of the province's top politicians, professionals and a world class athlete.\n\nDuring Christmas, the Cabagan Square Park could be seen flashing brightly with many Christmas lights and lanterns. Cabagan's top schools are Cabagan Science Elementary School; Saint Ferdinand College - Cabagan Campus; Isabela State University; and Delfin Albano High School (Main Campus). The Malasi Lake is a sanctuary for migratory birds located in barangay San Antonio and has been hailed by the DENR. The biggest gymnasium in Isabela and in the whole Region 2 is located in this town and the century-old well that was built by the Spaniards, located at St. Ferdinand College, Cabagan Campus. The carousel in Cabagan Square Park has been dubbed by the townspeople as the largest in the Philippines.\n\nCabagan is politically subdivided into 26 barangays.\n\nEtymologically, the name Cabagan may have originated from the native word \"bag\" or \"bajaque\", not because \"G-strings\" were used here or made in Cabagan, but most probably because there were stores in the village, Cabagan could have also been derived from the word \"cabbagang\", meaning \"pilgrim\" or stranger. Based on the fact that Cabagan at the time, was in constant contact with members of the \"pagan tribes\" from Diffun, namely southern Isabela as well as with the \"Kalingas\", of the neighboring Cordillera mountains.\n\nThe Cabagan of old, that existed from 1646 to 1877 was simply called, \"Cabagan\".\nIn 1877, the Spaniards decided to transfer present-day Cabagan to a new site, abandoning the old Cabagan.\nIn 1888, the Spaniards resurrected the abandoned Cabagan, into a new town. With this development, there were now two Cabagans.\nThe Spaniards rectified the predicament by naming the first Cabagan as \"Cabagan Viejo\", and the second Cabagan as \"Cabagan Nuevo\" or the new Cabagan.\nApparently, the name was not to the liking of the new rulers, the Americans. When the Americans came to rule the Philippines after the Spaniards, they renamed Cabagan Nuevo as simply \"Cabagan\", and the old namesake, as the town of San Pablo.\n\nThe old Cabagan, Cabagan Viejo which is now called \"San Pablo\", was the key town in the colonization of the Irrayas and to some extent Diffun, i.e., southern Isabela. The Irraya rebelled and the only ones that the Spaniards could claim, were some three hundred families who agreed to establish the village of Maquilla, near Tuguegarao City. Cabagan became a charter town in November 30, 1646 and ecclesiastically in May 15, 1647 with Saint Paul the Apostle as the patron saint.\n\nThe new Cabagan came to exist, because the Spanish government decreed that in January 25, 1877, the old Cabagan or San Pablo of today, be transferred from its old site, to the one that is now occupying. The brainchild of the transfer of Cabagan, was parish priest Pedro Ricart, who then made representations with the Spanish government, for the transfer. Father Jose Burgues \"History of Cagayan Valley\" gave the unhealthiness of the old site, the reason for the transfer. Others had stated though, that Cabagan was transferred because progress appeared to be bypassing the old Cabagan, in favor of the villages to the south, near Cabagan's present site. The new site was the area between the villages of Ugad and Luquilu, villages that exists up to this day. The site is not far from the old, with the church of the new Cabagan just some three kilometers or so, south from that of the old.\nThe transfer was not without friction though. A number of Cabagan's inhabitants opposed the transfer. But the missionary's will had prevailed. In contempt, as it were of the natives' opposition, the missionary uprooted the Church of the old Cabagan and brought the images and other vestments, to the new Cabagan.\nWhen the Spaniards established a new town, they also endeavored to build a massive church and convent made of stone, brick and mortar. From 1877, when the new Cabagan was established, and culminating with the Philippine Revolution that deposed the ruling Spaniards 19 years later (1896), the then governing Spaniards were still not able to complete all constructions needed, for the new Cabagan.\nCabagan is a known meeting place among revolutionaries during the Spanish occupation.\n\nIn the , the population of Cabagan, Isabela, was people, with a density of .\n\nCabagan, as part of the Irraya region and its language, was Irraya. The Spaniards however, made the Ibanag \"The Official Language of the Valley\", and had exerted all efforts that everyone speak the dialect. Since then, the Irraya tongue gradually disappeared from the Cabagan psyche.\n\nWhen some people utter Irraya before, they were discouraged or forbidden to speak, because that was the language of the \"pagans\" at that time, the Kalingas. Whenever the townsfolk enter the poblacion, none would speak of Irraya, for they would be considered despicably as, a \"Kalinga\" or as \"ignorant persons\", living in the mountains.\n\nToday, no one speaks Irraya. There are however, a few barrios in Cabagan today, like San Bernardo and Tallag, wherein the Ibanag dialect gets interspersed with Irraya. However, some older generation townsfolk, could also remember sentences in Irraya.\n\nIlocano is also spoken in parts of Cabagan because of migration of poor Ilocanos from other parts of Luzon to seek opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was actually the fourth symphony composed by Bruckner, after the Study Symphony in F minor (1863), the Symphony No. 1 in C minor (1866), and the Symphony \"No. 0\" in D minor (1869).\n\nIn the fall of 1871, after having become established in Vienna, Anton Bruckner embarked on a new symphonic project, his fourth, which in less than a year would result in a completed and copied score of nearly 2000 bars.\nThe Symphony No. 2, which was mostly written in the summer of 1872, represents a breakthrough in Bruckner’s conception of the symphony. Although Bruckner had been composing sonata-form movements with three distinct themes since he began writing symphonies in 1862, in 1872 he greatly expanded the scope of their presentation and development, and established the framework, which he would use consistently in all of his subsequent symphonic work. Moreover, the Adagio of this symphony is in ABA′B′A″ \"Lied\" form followed by a coda – the framework which Bruckner would use in his subsequent symphonic work, with exception of the Sixth.\n\nThe Second Symphony is the only numbered Bruckner symphony without a dedication; Franz Liszt tacitly rejected the dedication, and Richard Wagner chose the Symphony No. 3 in D minor when offered both works. The symphony was planned to be performed in the same year by the Vienna Philharmonic under Otto Dessoff. However, the rehearsal did not lead to a performance, because Dessoff and a number of players considered it impossible to perform. Nevertheless, the symphony was premiered the following year, on 26 October 1873, by the Vienna Philharmonic with Bruckner himself on the podium.\n\nThe score calls for a pair each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, and strings.\n\nThe symphony has four movements. In the first version (1872) they are:\n\nIn the second version (1877) they are:\n\nThe description below will use the tempo markings of the latter version.\n\nThe symphony opens with tremolo strings and the lyrical main theme emerges from under this:\n\n\\new Staff \\relative c\" { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Moderato\" 2 = 60\n\\new Staff \\relative as' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2\n</score>\nNote that although there is tremolo, it is a somewhat slower tremolo than what Bruckner would employ in later symphonies. Shortly after this, an \"enigmatic\" trumpet call appears:\n\\new Staff \\relative c\" { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2 = 60\n</score>\nThis rhythm is an important device and will recur throughout the movement. The first theme group closes with one of the symphony's characteristic pauses and leads to the second theme group in E flat major:\n</score>\nThe third theme group is also in E major:\n\\new Staff \\relative bes' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2 = 60\n\\new Staff \\relative es { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef bass \\time 2/2\n</score>\nThe trumpet call from the first group recurs here. The movement heads into its development after a brief codetta. The recapitulation opens just as the exposition did; with tremolo strings giving way to the main theme and the reappearance of the trumpet call. At the end, there is a brief recollection of the main theme before a grand peroration closes the movement. The first part of the coda is cut in the second version.\n\nIn the first version, both sections of the Scherzo and both sections of the Trio are repeated. These repeats were excised in the second version. The Scherzo is based on rhythmic theme heard at the outset:\n\\new Staff \\relative c\" { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 3/4 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Mäßig schnell\" 4 = 245\n\\new Staff \\relative c { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef bass \\time 3/4\n</score>\nThe Trio is based on a \"tipsy\" melody in the violas:\n\\new Staff \\relative c\" { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\major \\clef treble \\time 3/4 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Gleiches tempo\" 4 = 190\n\\new Staff \\relative e' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\major \\clef treble \\time 3/4\n</score>\n\nThis movement opens quietly with the strings:\n\\relative c\" {\n</score>\nThis movement is the first Bruckner slow movement in five-part ternary form and so this part will recur twice. The second part of the movement begins with pizzicato strings introducing a new theme on the horns:\n\\new Staff \\relative des' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key aes \\major \\clef bass \\time 4/4 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 54\n\\new Staff \\relative as' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key aes \\major \\clef treble \\time 4/4\n</score>\nThe second part was cut roughly in half in the second version. The latter half contained a decorated restatement of the horn theme. However, the fourth part of the movement contains a similar (But not identical) passage in both versions. Near the end of the movement, Bruckner quotes from the \"Benedictus\" of his F minor Mass before the main theme begins the coda:\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\nThe movement opens quietly with the second violins playing an eighth-note accompaniment and the first violins playing a descending scale:\n\\new Staff \\relative as\" { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Mehr schnell\" 2 = 95\n\\new Staff \\relative g' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2\n</score>\nThis leads to the second theme of the first theme group, a loud passage given by the full orchestra that will recur as the main theme of the third theme group:\n\\new Staff \\relative c\" { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2 = 95\n\\new Staff \\relative g { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2\n</score>\nThe quiet opening returns after this and leads into the A major second theme group, called \"Schubertian\" by Georg Tintner:\n\\new Staff \\relative cis\" { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\major \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2 = 90\n\\new Staff \\relative a, { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\major \\clef bass \\time 2/2\n</score>\nThe exposition closes with a quote of the \"Kyrie\" of the F minor Mass. The development contains what William Carragan refers to as \"fantasies\" on the first and second theme groups. The recapitulation begins with the loud secondary theme of the first group before moving into the quieter first theme. Among other cuts between versions, one of note is in the coda of the movement. In the original version the coda is in two phases; a buildup leading to quotations of the first movement and the second theme group of this movement. This leads to the second phase, another buildup leading to the grand peroration in C major that closes the symphony. The first of these phases is cut in the second version, leaving only the final buildup and peroration.\n\nThe composer made two versions of this symphony recognised by the \"Internationale Bruckner-Gesellschaft\" (1872 and 1877). The work was also adjusted by the composer right before its premiere, as well as in 1876 and 1892.\n\nThis was published in a 2005 edition by William Carragan under the auspices of the \"Internationale Bruckner-Gesellschaft\" in 2005. The Scherzo comes second; the slow movement follows. Georg Tintner: “Bruckner’s mania for revision sometimes bore positive fruits … [but with] the Second and the Third [symphonies] his first versions seem to me the best.”\n\nBruckner made adjustments preparing for the 1873 premiere.\nThe violin solo … in duple quarters and duple eighths, … together with the rhythmic complexities already caused by the shift from sextuplets to quintuplets in the first violins, … must have created an amazingly detailed sound – not to say an impenetrable musical fog.\"\n\nIn 1876, Bruckner made additional, smaller changes prior the second performance, which occurred on 20 February 1876 in the Musikvereinsaal under Bruckner's baton.Bruckner made mainly cuts in the coda of the first movement, and in the development of the second theme and the coda of the Finale. The peroration of the Finale is recomposed and the additional trombone is removed.\n\nBruckner crossed out the second half of section 2 of the slow movement, judged too difficult for the solo horn – with, as a result, an imbalance in the structure of the movement – and re-orchestrated its section 5. He also made additional cuts in the first movement and the Finale, and dropped the “Neuer Satz“ and substituted it for an 18-bar long, new material. \n\nThis, the first published edition of the symphony, was prepared by Cyrill Hynais and was until recently thought to be inauthentic, but Carragan has shown that it corresponds closely to the 1877 version. This version was performed on 25 November 1894 by the Vienna Philharmonic under Hans Richter.\n\nThe first recording of any part of the symphony was made by Fritz Zaun with the Berlin State Opera Orchestra in 1934: a cut version of the Scherzo in the 1892 first published edition. The oldest surviving complete performance is by Georg-Ludwig Jochum with the Bruckner Orchestra of Linz, dating from 1944 and using the Haas edition. The first commercial recording was by Volkmar Andreae with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra in 1953, also using the Haas edition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Barenboim conducting the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, 1997 (using a pre-publ.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nBeing a major rice producing town, it is the home of several rice mills and rice traders, dubbed as the Land of the Golden Grains.\n\nCabatuan occupies a land area of 7,200 hectares. It lies in the south-western part of the Province of Isabela bounded on the north by the Municipality of Aurora, on the east by the Municipality of Luna, on the west by the Municipality of San Mateo and on the south by the Municipality of Cauayan. Its territorial boundaries are more specifically delineated under Executive Order 293 issued by President Elpidio Quirino on November 5, 1949.\n\nUpon the creation of Cabatuan in 1949, twelve barrios were extracted from the mother-town of Cauayan. They were: Cabatuan (as the seat of government), Buenavista, Caggong, Canan, Culing, Diamantina, Luzon, Macalaoat, Magdalena, Namnama, Tandul Viejo and Villa Visaya. The three sitios were: Nueva Era, Sampaloc and Saranay.\n\nIn 1951, a major re-organization was made creating the new barrios of: Calaocan (from Culing), Centro East (from the old Barrio of Cabatuan-poblacion), Centro West (from the old Barrio of Cabatuan-poblacion), La Paz (from Canan and Namnama), Nueva Era 1 (from Culing), Nueva Era 2 (from Culing), Sampaloc and Saranay. Barrio Buenavista, on the other hand, was joined with Barrio Caggong while Barrio Villa Visaya was also incorporated with Barrio Diamantina.\n\nIn 1956, two additional barrios were formed. Barrio Del Pilar was created from Magdalena while Barrio Del Corpuz was extracted from Nueva Era 1.\n\nIn 1964, Barrio Centro West was renamed to T. Abad honoring one of the founders of Cabatuan, Senor Teodoro Abad while Barrio Centro East was simply called Barrio Centro. Also the same year, Barrio Caggong was re-christened to Rang-ay while Barrio Tandul Viejo was simply called Tandul. Barrio Nueva Era 1 was renamed to Culing West while the remaining fraction of old Culing was called Culing East. Barrio Nueva Era 2 was plainly called Nueva Era.\n\nIn 1969, Barrios Culing East and West were chopped to accommodate a new barrio and was named Culing Centro.\n\nThe continuous re-organization of the barangay administrative and political set-up divided Barrio Macalaoat and in 1972, the Barrios of Magsaysay and Paraiso were created. The territory of Barrio Magsaysay was derived from the western portion while Barrio Paraiso got its land area at the eastern side of Macalaoat. Also in the same year, Barrio T. Abad was again renamed to San Andres to honor Cabatuan's patron, Saint Andrew the Apostle.\n\nToday the Municipality of Cabatuan has 22 barangays:\nThe early inhabitants of the vast forest land were the Kalingas who are indigenous to the mountain provinces. These settlers lived on tree houses which they built along the banks of the bountiful and mighty Magat River. These sturdy, dark complexioned, G-stringed, soldier-like people depended on hunting, fishing and a little agriculture and poultry.\n\nIn 1912, the pioneering Ilocanos started arriving with their families, relatives and friends. The Ilocanos settled away from the river but the Kalingas considered it an intrusion which later led to the encounters where the Ilocanos used piles of stones to drive away the ferocious Kalingas. The act of throwing stones was called “ambatuan” which later evolved to “cabatuan”. The warring groups eventually became friends through a peace pact led by their respective leaders and the place became known as Cabatuan.\n\nIn 1914, Cabatuan was incorporated with the Municipality of Cauayan. Many leaders emerged from the Cabatuan settlers and seeing that they are a political threat to the Cauayan leadership, the Municipal Council of Cauayan in 1948 agreed and endorsed the segregation of Cabatuan from the mother town. Through the initiative of the delegation formed by leaders who hailed from Barrio Cabatuan, Executive Order 293 creating the Municipality of Cabatuan was finally signed by President Elpidio R. Quirino in Malacañang on November 5, 1949. On November 30, 1949, the set of municipal officials appointed by President Quirino took their oath of office signaling the independence of Cabatuan from its mother town.\n\nThe land where Cabatuan now nestles was once teeming with vegetation, wildlife and fish, nurtured by the mighty and winding Magat River. Its history started when one of the indigenous people of the mountain provinces settled down in the vast valley of Cagayan where the Apayaos, Dumagats, Gaddangs, Ibanags, Ifugaos, Igorots, Itawes, Palananons and the Yogads were living. This tribe is known as the Kalingas, the name believed to have come from the Ibanag and Gaddang word, which means \"headhunters\". The Kalinga villages were strategically located along the banks of the Magat River in south-western Isabela near the boundary of Ifugao province, surrounding the locality now known as Sili, Bolinao, Dalig Kalinga (these places are now barangays of Aurora town) and Subasta (now a sitio of Barangay Saranay in Cabatuan). The early Cabatuanenses were generally known to be medium in height, with dark complexion and lissome with high nose bridges. Physically, they were very sturdy and well-built so that their war-like bearing feature made them more like soldiers. They lived on tree-houses and depended on hunting, fishing and a little of poultry and agriculture. The Kalingas were believed to be the descendants of the second wave of Malay who came to the Islands from Borneo. These pagans were headed by several able leaders like: Ronsan and Ngolan (both from Sili in Aurora town), Balindan, Melad and Gombi (from Bolinao, also in Aurora town), Tullayao Bayudoc (from Subasta, Saranay in Cabatuan) and the grand old chieftain Materig (also from Sili in Aurora town).\n\nThe Kalingas preferred to stay in the Cabatuan area of jurisdiction rather than in Aurora because the town proper of Aurora then was located in Dalig, now a barangay of Burgos town.\n\nWhen the Christians arrived, the Kalingas attached the word \"Infiel\" before their native name to fulfill their yearning for a second name like those of Christians. The name \"Infiel\" was derived from \"ynfieles\", a Spanish friar's term for non-believers of the Christian faith.\n\nAfter the Ilocano migrants, several waves of settlers particularly locals from Pangasinan and Central Luzon region came to Isabela as merchants. Some of the Pangasinan pioneers were: Nicolas T. Almirol (original surname is Lagasca), Benito Monte, Hermogenes B. Soriben and Zacarias P. Munoz.\n\nSome of the Tagalog migrants were: Carlino O. Munsayac (Nueva Ecija), Atanasio H. Dayrit (San Fernando, Pampanga), Atty. Rafael M. Tomacruz (then Mayor of Hagonoy, Bulacan and Provincial Board Member), Anselmo S. Esmino (Licab, Nueva Ecija), Mr. Pamintuan (Pampanga), Andres Alivia (Rizal, Nueva Ecija) and Antonio V. Altoveros (Rizal, Nueva Ecija).\n\nThe Chinese also migrated to Cabatuan and opted to permanently reside in the locality and inter-married with young Ilocano maidens. The bulk of the Chinese migrants came from Amoy, China in the 1930s. The Chinese migrants were: Clemente Paggabao (married Andrea Labasan), Eusebio Uy (married Lourdes Visaya), Juan Uy (married Felisa Acio), Mariano Uy (married Lourdes dela Cruz), Kaya Uy (married Carmen Rambac), Inocencio Uy (married Mercedes Domingcil), Francisco Uy (married Mercedes Llamelo), Guillermo Uy (married Tomasa Padron), Lorenzo Uy (married Teodora Visaya), Venancio Tio (married Monica Accorda), Vicente Pua (married Sabina Ventura), Joaquin Pua (married Entonia Labayog), Pedro Pua (married Isabela Guerrero), Kiana Uy (married Claudia Manuel), Pascual Pua (married Carmen Uy), Densoy Ty (married Maxima Uy), Tomas Uy, Miguel Dy, Mariano Tio, Julian Pua (married Felicitas Bagcal), Eusebio Tan (married Eusenia Lomotan), Jose Uy (married Adelina Ventura), Ben Chong (married Gue Eng Tio), Alfonso Uy (married Engracia Uy), Sytong Uy, Uwa Uy (married Avelina Gervacio), Ben Co (married Maria Vea), Pedro Ong (married Salud Bacallan), Pedro Yan (married Maria Aczon), Tio Nga Luy (married Pelagia Acosta), Alfredo Uy (married Ruperta V. Pancho)\n\nIn 1914, during the American Regime, Cabatuan was incorporated with the Municipality of Cauayan, Isabela with Senor Agapito A. Pilar as the first Barrio Teniente. Others who assumed the post were: Florencio Abad, Leocadio Acio, Pedro Acob, Felipe Aczon, Tomas Camungao, T. Damunglo, Jose Castillo, Cirilo Guerrero, Platon Guillermo, Ignacio Juan, Antonio S. Medina, Felipe Pascual, Feliciano A. Ramos, Roman Rivera, Inigo Sales, Francisco Salvador, Tirso Santos, B. Sumawang, Juan Ventura. Don Bernardo C. Dacuycuy, the acknowledged founder of Cabatuan, was appointed by Governor-General Leonard Wood as President of the Confederate Districts of Antatet (now Luna town), Dalig (former poblacion of Aurora town and now a barangay of Burgos town), Bolinao and Sili (now barangays of Aurora town). Later on, Cabatuan was sub-divided into four districts. District 1, comprises what is now the barangays of Sampaloc and Saranay. District 2, the barrio proper, comprises what is now the barangays of Centro and San Andres. District 3, comprises what is now the barangays of Del Pilar, Magdalena and portions of Paraiso. And District 4, comprises all populated areas upstream the Magat River like Macalaoat, Culing and Diamantina.\n\nThe desire to have a representation for the Magat region prompted the Cabatuanenses to support the candidacy of several of their barrio folks. Thus, the administrations of Cauayan Municipal Mayors Guillermo Blas (1938) and Zoilo Cuntapay (1938-1940), three of their Municipal Councilors hailed from Cabatuan. They were: Paz Sales-Cruz, Francisco Razon and Atanasio H. Dayrit. And realizing that men and women of Barrio Cabatuan has the potential and capacity to lead the whole town of Cauayan, the Cabatuanenses rallied behind the candidacy of Federico P. Acio as mayor. Acio won and assumed office in 1941 but his term was cut short when the Japanese Imperial Army occupied the valley. Acio was replaced by the appointment of Jose Canciller.\n\nWhen the Second World War erupted, several sons and daughters of Cabatuan were involved in various encounters in the countryside. The brave and freedom loving Cabatuanenses who fought for democracy in Bataan were: Norberto V. Abad (suffered the Death March), Dominador Acob (suffered the Death March), Victorino R. Agustin, Leopoldo Cadeliria (suffered the Death March), Alejandro A. Cadiente (suffered the Death March), Ventura D. Frogoso, Elpidio A. Galiza, Domingo J. Marcelo, Juan B. Molina (suffered the Death March), Ranulfo Navarro, Andres N. Palado, Cenon B. Ramos, Jose M. Rivera, Florencio B. Sacaben (suffered the Death March), Simeon B. Santos, Victorino O. Santos (missing in action), Lorenzo T. Sunga, Manuel T. Talimada, Damian S. Tomacruz and Hermogenes S. Tomas. Though the island of Corregidor and the peninsula of Bataan became the concentration of the war, many provinces in Luzon Island also participated in the fighting. The Cabatuanenses who fought outside Bataan were: Benedicto A. Acosta (Ilocos), Teodoro P. Asuncion (died in action in Tuguegarao, Cagayan), Sebastian M. Ballesteros (Ilocos), Rizalino M. Camungao (died in action in Batangas), Florencia M. Dacuycuy (Women's Auxiliary Service in Ilocos) and Enrique Padron (died in action in Tuguegarao, Cagayan).\n\nAs the Japanese Imperial Army occupied the valley after the Fall of Bataan, strong resistance continued. Many gallant Cabatuanenses joined the underground \"guerilla\" movement, locally known as the Bolo Unit as they continue their quest for freedom. The Guerillas from Cabatuan were: Federico P. Acio, Damaso A. Acosta, Mariano P. Alejo, Antonio V. Altoveros, Nestor R. Altoveros, Alvaro C. Antolin, Rufino D. Apostol, Benito G. Bauzon, Osmundo S. Bungay, Pacifico S. Cabantac, Felix G.

Rumbaoa, Maura A. Sales, Domingo D. Salgado, Severino Tarapia, Juanito S. Topinio, Juan P. Valeroso, Avelino A. Villanueva, Vicente Villar and Juan G. Visaya.\n\nMayor Acio was one of the remaining mayors of northern Luzon who have not surrendered to the Japanese. The foreign invaders tried to make Acio surrender by torturing his wife, Josefa Ventura-Acio, through \"water treatment\". In reality, the poor Mrs. Acio never knew the whereabouts of her husband and her suffering continued until before Liberation.\n\nThe tabacalera (almasin), now owned by Senor Bernardo Bulosan Garcia Sr married to Efrenia Tejada Ancheta, in District (now Barangay San Andres) became the chief garrison (Center of Command) of the invading foreigners. Other prominent Japanese garrisons were the residences of Federico Acio, Francisco Acob and Daniel Crisologo. The ever-fighting guerillas continued their underground activities and were fully supported by the barrio people. The Niponggo troops made plans to liquidate this stubborn resistance. The Japanese soldiers hired Filipinos to serve as \"magic eyes\" (Makapili) to pinpoint those who were supporters and members of the movement. The civilians who were unfortunate to be tagged and assassinated were: Catalino Pascual, Ireneo Acedo, Severino Tarampi and a certain Mr. Gomez. There was also an incident where the Japanese kidnapped a lady by the name of Genoveva A. Agsalda (residing in what is now Barangay San Andres) while reaping tobacco in her field (in Sili, Aurora) and never to be found again.\n\nWhen the \"liberating\" American warplanes arrived, a house in District Dos (now San Andres) where at least two families were residing was mistakenly identified as a Japanese camp. The house was heavily bombarded killing all the inhabitants of the compound. The fatalities were: Agustin Duldulao and wife Josefa Mercado with sister Teodorica M. Visaya. The Duldulao children were: Aprecion, Emeteria, Severo, Angel, Teofilo and the eldest, Demetrio and wife Demetria Aczon with their three-months old baby girl, Angeles.\n\nIn the , the population of Cabatuan, Isabela, was people, with a density of .\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Local Government Finance, the annual regular revenue of Cabatuan for the fiscal year of 2016 was ₱106,631,260.21.\n\nThis town has excellent telecommunications facilities.

{"id": "2069787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069787", "title": "Tröger's base", "text": "Tröger's base\n\nTröger's base is a white solid organic compound, with a tetracyclic structure and formula of (CHCHNCH)CH. Tröger's base and its analogs are soluble in various organic solvents and strong acidic aqueous solutions due to their protonation. \n\nTröger's original research in 1887, failed to elaborate the exact structure of his new product that lead Johannes Wislicenus, the departmental director of the time, to assign a mediocre grade for Tröger's thesis. Despite various possible structures had been drawn for Tröger's product, its correct structure remained as a mystery for 48 years, until the final elucidation in 1935 by Spielman.\n\nThe nitrogen inversion normally leads to a rapid equilibrium between the enantiomers of chiral amines, that prevents them showing any optical activity. The inversion can be stopped by conformational strain as Tröger's base has demonstrated that nitrogen is capable of forming a stereogenic center in organic molecules. In Tröger's base, this inversion is not possible, and the nitrogen atoms are defined stereogenic centers. The separation of the enantiomers of Tröger's base was first accomplished by Vladimir Prelog in 1944. Prelog performed column chromatography using a chiral stationary phase as a relatively new method that later on gained popularity and became a standard procedure. Tröger's base and its analogs can be resolved by various methods including chiral HPLC or be made as a single enantiomer.\n\nAlmost 30 years after Tröger's initial report, Hünlich described another mysterious product obtained from the condensation of formaldehyde and 2,4-diaminotoluene. After almost a century the structure of Hünlich's product was elucidated by X-ray crystallography as a C-symmetric amine-carrying analogue of Tröger's base. Tröger's base is a diamine, which exceptionally exhibits chirality due to the prevented inversion of configuration of two bridgehead stereogenic tertiary amine groups. Tröger's base and its analogs racemize under acidic conditions through the formation of iminium intermediates, that can be prevented by the replacement of methano-bridge with an ethano-bridge.\n\nThe molecule can be considered a molecular tweezer as the skeleton forces the molecule in a rigid locked conformation with the aromatic rings in 90 degree proximity.\n\nTröger's base and its analogs have been used as chiral discriminators for the recognition of a variety of organic compounds and as ligand in inorganic chemistry. When the methyl groups are replaced by interactive groups such as carboxylic acids or pyridine amide groups a host–guest chemistry interaction can take place between the Tröger's base and other molecules including glycosaminoglycans. It is found that the cavity dimensions are optimal for inclusion of suberic acid but that with a longer acid sebacic acid or a shorter acid adipic acid the interaction is less favorable. \nChromophore carrying analogs of the Tröger's base have displayed unique NLO properties and can be used as molecular switches and liquid crystal dopants. \n\nTröger's base is of historic interest as was first synthesised in 1887 from p-toluidine and formaldehyde in acid solution by Julius Tröger. It can also be prepared with DMSO and hydrochloric acid or hexamethylene tetraamine (HMTA) as formaldehyde replacement. The reaction mechanism with DMSO as methylene donor for this reaction is similar to that of the Pummerer rearrangement. The interaction of DMSO and hydrochloric acid yields an electrophilic sulfenium ion that reacts with the aromatic amine in an electrophilic addition. Methanethiol is eliminated and the resulting imine reacts with a second amine. Sulfenium ion addition and elimination is repeated with the second amino group and the imine group reacts in an intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. Imine generation is repeated a third time and the reaction concludes with a second electrophilic substitution to the other aromat. Stereoselective, enantiospecific methods have also been introduced for the direct synthesis of optically active analogs of Tröger's base.\n"}

It was originally composed of 21 barrios of virgin forest and wide fertile plains with Cabanuangan as the seat of the Municipal Government.\n\nThe house of one Tirso Mateo served as the first town hall with the following as the first municipal officials; President;Don Antonio Vallejo, Vice President; Benito Tiburcio, Secretary; Francisco Gumpal; Treasurer Pio Tomines; Justice of Peace Daniel Apostol; Zoilo Gadingan, Chief of Police; and Modesto Payuyo, Antonio Pintang, Gregorio Santos, Dionicio Cristobal, Valentin Torio; and Damaso Leano as Councilors.\n\nThe first proposed town site of Jones was in Barangay Daligan, but due to the insistence of the Municipal President Don. Antonio Vallejo who voluntarily donated two hectares of land for the municipal hall and public market site, he also later donated the vast fertile land area of Jones Rural School and Jones North Central School hence the present site of Barangay I and II.\n\nTransportation was then a big problem as there were no good roads, the barrios being only connected by narrow roads and trails suited for hiking, for horse and carabao and for sled and cart. During rainy days, these roads and trails easily turned into knee-deep mud fit only for wallowing carabaos. The principal means of transportation was the Cagayan River passing almost all the barrios, using raft and boats. It was only after about eight years of existence that more vehicles applied between Jones and Echague.\n\nThe vast virgin forest and fertile soil of the place was pioneered by enterprising Ilocanos from the Ilocos Province, particularly from Ilocos Norte and some Yogads who are natives of Cagayan Valley. Other ethnic groups followed like the Ibanags and some Tagalogs from Central Luzon.\n\nThe Aglipayan Church (Philippine Independent Catholic Church) was the first established church. There were very few primary schools, all hinged to an intermediate school called Jones Farm School at the Poblacion. The early inhabitants concentrated on agriculture with tobacco and corn as the chief crop. Revenue principally came from the real property tax, cedula and sled tax. The town was greatly dependent on national aid.\n\nThe town holds a special place in the history of Isabela. When the Japanese Imperial Army invaded the Philippines in 1914, JONES was a shelter for the National and Provincial officials and evacuees from other places up to 1942.\n\nThe town likewise became the provincial seat of the Provincial Government during the wartorn years from 1941 to 1942. It was subsequently occupied by the Japanese forces but it continued to be a stronghold of Filipino and American Guerillas led by the brave soldiers under the command of the Brigadier General Guillermo Nakar.\n\nOn 1945, Filipino troops of the 2nd, USAFFE 11th, 12th and 13th Infantry Division and the USAFIP-NL 11th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 1st Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was liberated and recaptured the entering towns in Jones, Isabela and helping recognized guerrilla units and defeated and attacking Japanese Imperial Army forces and ended in World War II.\n\nJones is the home of Silvino M.

There are more or less 700 family heads of inhabitants in the barangay and they are classified into four ethnic groups which are the Ilokos, Ifugaos, Igorots and Gaddangs. Agricultural products such as corn, cassava, banana and rice are the source of income of the Dicamay people.\n\nSibsib falls is the known tourist spot in Dicamay 2 which is 4 km from the barangay proper. It is a great place for bonding. Many visitors from other towns and barangays enjoy the beauty and freshness of air and water in the falls.\n\nDicamay people also celebrates the Banana “Saba” festival in the month of May.

The Agta are one of the many groups known as 'Negritos' and who are descended from the pre-Austronesian population of the islands. The Dicamay Agta, who combined hunter-gathering with swidden agriculture, have been severely impacted by the influx of other ethnic groups to take up farming land in the area, resulting in there being no Agta living in the area today. There are numerous reports of the Agta having been driven off their lands, and in some cases of having been killed by immigrant groups of farmers.\n\nJones is primarily an agricultural municipality best suited for the intensive production of rice and corn as evidence by its topographic map which shows that 73% of the agricultural area of 16,848 hectares is under 0-3 slope category.\n\nPinilisa Festival\n\nThe “Pinilisa Festival” is an acknowledgment of all Jonesian and celebrated every 17th day of March for the bountiful harvest of rice Pinilisa product, a unique organic plum colored rice known not only in the region but as well as on other country, due to its unique fragrant and unique flavor compared to other ordinary rice. Unlike other varieties that rely on synthetic commercial fertilizer to grow healthy, it is rare breed of rice thrives only rainwater and natural features to make it a favorite food for consumers.<\n\nThe success of the first Pinilisa Festival was conceptualized by the initiative of the administration of Florante A. Raspado, he was the first Director-General of the Pinilisa Festival. The festival was easily produced and marked the history of the town of Jones and one among the line-up of the Department of Tourism Wow! Philippines Program, making Pinilisa Festival is recognized not only in the Philippines but as well as on the world.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality of Mallig was named after the Mallig river that traverses it. The area was first mentioned by Fray Pedro de Santo Tomas as the area to which the Irray/Gaddang fled after the revolt of Dayag and Catabay in 1621 in what is now Ilagan City.\n\nIn 1939, then President Manuel L. Quezon declared the westernmost part of the province as a resettlement area, historically known as the Mallig Plains Resettlement Area. From then on, the influx of settlers from the Central Plains and the Ilocos Region encouraged more other settlers to migrate westward in these Kalinga-dominated plains.\n\nMallig was created by virtue of RA 678 authored in 1952 by congressman Samuel F. Reyes. The act was approved on April 8, 1953 with the former barrio Olango as the seat of government. The territory comprising Mallig was taken from several neighboring towns:\n\nMallig was never a ready haven and abode for the migrants at the beginning, particularly because of the hostile natives who formerly dominated the area, and also because of the occurrence of endemic malaria. It took the settlers gradual adaptation and acclimatization before they finally convinced their relatives and other migrants to settle permanently.\n\nMallig is bounded by the towns of Paracelis, Mt. Province on its western limits, Quezon, Isabela on its northern limits, Roxas, Isabela on its southern limits and by both Delfin Albano and Quirino, Isabela on its eastern limits. It is municipality within the Division/Province of Isabela in the region of Cagayan Valley.\n\nIts main gateway is the Santiago-Tuguegarao road which is a part of the national highway. The Ilagan-Delfin Albano-Mallig road, a provincial road, also serves as an important point of entry to Mallig.\n\nIt is also an agricultural town mainly composed of agricultural farms such as rice fields and corn fields which makes its rural landscape.\n\nMallig is politically subdivided into 18 barangays.\n\nThe climate in Mallig is tropical. Mallig has significant rainfall most months, with a short dry season. This location is classified as Am by Köppen and Geiger. The temperature here averages 27.0 °C.

{"id": "2069808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069808", "title": "Queens Botanical Garden", "text": "Queens Botanical Garden\n\nQueens Botanical Garden is a botanical garden located at 43-50 Main Street in Flushing, Queens, New York City. The site features rose, bee, herb, wedding, and perennial gardens; an arboretum; an art gallery; and a LEED-certified Visitor & Administration Building. Queens Botanical Garden is located on property owned by the City of New York, and is funded from several public and private sources. It is operated by Queens Botanical Garden Society, Inc.\n\nQueens Botanical Garden was created as part of the 1939 New York World's Fair and was originally located in nearby Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. It moved to its current location, a landfilled area east of Flushing Meadows Park, in 1963 in preparation for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Since then, the Queens Botanical Garden has continued to expand, with programming targeted at residents of surrounding community. In 2001, the Queens Botanical Garden Society published a master plan for a renovation of the garden, centered around the garden's location above the underground Kissena Creek. Several improvements were made over the following years, including the construction of a new environmentally friendly parking lot and administration building.\n\nDuring the 1939 New York World's Fair, held in adjacent Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, what would become the Queens Botanical Garden was a horticultural exhibit of the fair called \"Gardens on Parade\" operated by Hortus, Incorporated. The original gardens were located just west of the modern site at the northeast corner of the fair grounds, at 131st Street between Lawrence Street and the Flushing River in the path of the future Van Wyck Expressway.\n\nA New York City Department of Sanitation garage at Dahlia Avenue was located west of Main Street, in the modern Queens Botanical Garden. By the 1950s it had been abandoned, and there were calls to demolish it.\n\nA playground located at Elder Avenue and 135th Street in what in now the Queens Botanical Garden, was originally set to be complete by March 1957. However, by March 11, only a comfort station and lights were constructed, while the site required significant filling before development could occur. According to the Parks Department, the project was delayed due to bad weather. The playground site was used as dumping ground, and it was filled with dirt after community petition. After a three month delay, the playground was completed in June 1957.\n\nPrior to the 1964–1965 New York World's Fair, the western portion of Kissena Corridor Park between Lawrence Street / College Point Boulevard and Main Street adjacent to Flushing Meadows Park was leased to the World's Fair Corporation, along with most of Flushing Meadows. In 1961, as part of a $3 million development for the World's Fair, the Queens Botanical Garden was planned to be relocated from the fair grounds in Flushing Meadows to a site across College Point Boulevard to the east, within the current Kissena Corridor Park and adjacent to the World's Fair grounds. This tract was described as \" of bogs and dump land\". The project included a new administration building, to cost $150,000, and a pedestrian overpass over Lawrence Street leading to Flushing Meadows. The existing garden in Flushing Meadows would be demolished to make way for new fair exhibits, and the extension of the Van Wyck Expressway north through the park to the Whitestone Expressway. This site was originally planned to be used as parking space for the fair.\n\nGrading work for the project began on March 22, 1961. The Board of Estimate approved the Botanical Garden project and other World's Fair projects in September 23, 1961. At the time, the work for the gardens was estimated to cost $341,700. Construction on the administration building began in 1962. The building was designed by the Brodsky, Hopf & Adler firm, which also designed terminals at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas. Landscaping work was done by Gilmore David Clarke and Michael Rapuano, who also designed the original 1939 World's Fair grounds and the 1964 layout for the fair. The section of Elder Avenue that ran southwest across the Corridor Park site between Main Street and Peck Avenue was de-mapped to integrate the land into the Botanical Gardens. Three Blue Atlas Cedar trees were transplanted from the original garden site to the new main entrance on Main Street. The new Queens Botanical Garden was dedicated on October 19, 1963.\n\nFollowing Queens Botanical Garden's completion, New York City Parks commissioner Robert Moses unveiled an expanded plan for Kissena Corridor. The plan also included the Queens Zoo, to be built adjacent to the Queens Botanical Garden and operated by the Queens Botanical Garden Society. The zoo was expected to be complete by spring 1967, but ultimately opened in October 1968.\n\nBy 1972, the garden was averaging 300,000 visitors per year. The count included 50,000 students who had gone to the garden over the previous two years as part of various partnerships with Queens schools, or an average of 25,000 students annually. In the subsequent decades, the Queens Botanical Garden had various programs intended for members of the surrounding communities. In 1977, the garden hired a few dozen teenagers from schools in Queens to help plant trees, build a path, and restore part of an adjoining city park that had been vandalized. During the 1980s, the Queens Botanical Garden had several volunteers who would work with disabled teenagers. A sample of events from a 1979 newspaper article included an annual Environment Day and Senior Day; gardening classes; and a spring luncheon benefit. The Queens Botanical Garden had a senior garden, a children's garden, and community corn patches by 1982, as well as herb, bee, and bird gardens.\n\nThe city took control of Queens Botanical Garden in 1992 after the previous director and twenty board members were ousted due to a dereliction of duties. The Queens Botanical Garden Society regained control in 1993, and Susan Lacerte was appointed as the garden's executive director. Shortly afterward, the Queens Botanical Garden Society began offering programs to the substantial Chinese, Korean, and Latin American populations of Flushing. In 1997, it was announced that a formal Korean garden would be planted in recognition of the Korean population in Flushing, which numbered more than 60,000 at the time.\n\nIn 1998, Queens Botanical Garden Society began devising a master plan for the garden. Details of the plan were released in 2001. The project would convert much of the garden into a landscaped green space surrounding a watercourse, as well as add sustainable energy features that would allow the garden to retain all of the rainwater that it collected. The master plan was designed by BKSK Architects, Conservation Design Forum, and Atelier Dreiseitl. The $70 million cost would be paid for by the city and state governments, though at the time, funding from both governments was limited due to budget cuts. The following year, a fence was erected around the garden at a cost of $3.9 million. The arboretum at the west end of Queens Botanical Garden, which was formerly accessible after the rest of the garden had closed, was now within the limits of the fence. A renovation of the rest of the garden was also undertaken at a cost of $68 million. The additions included a green roof above one building, solar panels, geothermal power generation systems, stormwater collection systems, and new wetlands and water features.\n\nOn September 27, 2007, Queens Botanical Garden's new Visitor & Administration Building was opened. The center, designed by BKSK Architects, was the first building in New York City to achieve the \"Platinum\" LEED rating, the highest energy-efficiency rating possible. The new building was the first phase of the renovated garden to open. The renovation also included the construction of an environmentally friendly parking lot on the garden's north side, which was shaped around the surrounding land contours and contains a meadow that was designed to accommodate additional parking. In addition, an artificial wetland and \"cleansing biotope\" were constructed to collect stormwater in the garden.\n\nQueens Botanical Garden is situated on an irregularly shaped plot in southern Flushing, in the central section of the New York City borough of Queens. It comprises of land bounded by Blossom Avenue, Cromellin Street, and Dahlia Avenue to the north; Main Street to the east; Peck, Elder, Booth Memorial Avenues and 133rd Street to the south; and College Point Boulevard to the west. Roughly are dedicated to outdoor exhibits. The garden is free to visit from November to March; for the rest of the year, various admission rates are charged.\n\nQueens Botanical Garden has a pedestrian entrance on Main Street, on its east side, and an entrance and parking lot at Cromellin Street, on its north side. The parking lot takes up much of the northwestern corner of Queens Botanical Garden. The visitor building and the gift shop and gallery are located on the north side of the Queens Botanical Garden. The majority of the public exhibits are located on the east side of the garden, where paths subdivide the land into smaller flower gardens. Various educational buildings, non-public structures, and the Compost Project Demonstration Site are located on the garden's north side. The Arboretum/Crabapple Grove and Meadow take up much of the southwest corner.\n\nQueens Botanical Garden is located in a dip that is lower than the surrounding streets. Most of the garden is atop landfill, which in turn covers the former Kissena Creek. As a result, water tends to flow downward from nearby areas toward the garden, and sinkholes previously tended to form inside the Queens Botanical Garden. Because of these qualities, \"The New York Times\" called the site, \"hydrologically speaking ... a drainage ditch\". The 2001 master plan called for redesigning the garden around the dip, and included five \"systems\" with a total of 27 water features. As part of the master plan, a \"cleansing biotope\" was built across the northern side of the Queens Botanical Garden.\n\nThe site is often associated with the adjacent Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, to the west. Main Street separates the garden from Kissena Corridor Park to the east.\n\nThe Visitor & Administration Building opened in 2007. The building is a two-story, structure that contains administrative offices and an auditorium inside. The center, designed by BKSK Architects, was the first public building in New York City to achieve the \"Platinum\" LEED rating, the highest energy-efficiency rating possible. It contained features such as geothermal heating, urinals that do not use water, and composting toilets. The Visitor and Administration Building also included a roof with three environmentally sustainable sections; one section contains solar panels; a second includes a rainwater collection system; and the last uses plants as insulation. These features were planned to reduce energy use by 40% compared to other buildings of similar size. The building was constructed by main contractor Stonewall Contracting Corporation at a cost of $12 million.\n\nThe Farm & Compost Site, respectively located at the southwestern and northwestern corners of the garden, showcases how to make and use compost to create healthy soil. It includes a compost bin display, one-acre farm, and pollinator habitat, that demonstrate how people can divert organic waste and improve urban soils. Vegetables grown on the farm are shared with intern and volunteers, and donated to emergency food relief programs. Crops include heirloom tomatoes, beans, turnips, and a variety of kale, lettuces, peppers, and radishes.\n\nQueens Botanical Garden includes the Fragrance Walk, an outdoor walkway lined with flowers that is located near the Main Street entrance. There is also a Bee Garden near the center south portion of the garden.\n\nKissena Creek initially ran under the present-day sites of Kissena Park, Kissena Corridor Park, and Queens Botanical Garden before meeting Flushing Creek at what is now the Fountain of Planets / Pool of Industry in Flushing Meadows. In 1934, Kissena Creek was placed in a culvert at its crossing with Main Street (then called Jagger Avenue), as part of a widening project for the street. The rest of the creek was buried underground in the mid-20th century during Queens Botanical Garden's construction.\n\nToday, the remnants of Kissena Creek flow in a sewer underneath Kissena and Kissena Corridor parks and the Queens Botanical Garden. It merges with an outflow sewer under Kissena Corridor. The sewers flow west into the Flushing Bay Combined Sewer Outfall (CSO) Retention Facility, located in Flushing Meadows underneath the Al Oerter Recreation Center across to the west of the Queens Botanical Garden. The facility can hold up to of water from overflows during storms, before pumping the water to the Tallman Island Waste Water Treatment Plant in College Point. Otherwise, the water empties into the Flushing River which flows north into Flushing Bay.\n\nQueens Botanical Garden hosts four seasons of public programming, including cultural celebrations and seasonal festivals such as Harvest Fest & Pumpkin Patch, Arbor Fest, and \"Taiwan: A World of Orchids.\" Previous events in the 2000s and 2010s included tours of the administration building conducted shortly after it opened, as well as various children's events during the falls and winters. In 2014 and 2015, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1964 World's Fair, a model-train show was hosted at the Queens Botanical Garden.\n\nQueens Botanical Garden's educational workshops and tours offer education to children, adults, and teachers through gardens. The Garden also hosts wedding ceremonies, receptions, and other private and corporate events. The Queens Botanical Garden has a Victorian-style Wedding Garden designed specifically for weddings. However, registration is required to use the wedding garden and education building.\n\nThe Queens Botanical Garden receives funding from several sources. In 2016, it received $4.076 million in revenue before expenses. Of this, more than half came from governmental sources, such as the city and state governments. The rest was raised through fundraising events, memberships, and donations. The largest non-governmental donation was from HSBC Bank, which sponsored the Children's Garden.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the city provided funding for about half of the garden's budget, and paid for all of the gardeners and maintenance workers. However, the city's allocation to Queens Botanical Garden decreased in the wake of the late-1970s New York City fiscal crisis, and funding was only restored in 1980 after significant outcry.\n\nIn 2005, Queens Botanical Garden was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation. This, in turn, was made possible through a donation by then-New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nSeveral bus routes of MTA Regional Bus Operations operate in the vicinity of Queens Botanical Garden. The bus route operates at the far west end of the park on College Point Boulevard, between Flushing Meadows–Corona Park to the west and the Queens Botanical Garden to the east. The route then crosses Flushing Meadows via the Long Island Expressway. The Q20A/B and Q44 Select Bus Service routes run on Main Street at west end of the park, serving the Queens Botanical Garden.\n\nThe closest New York City Subway station to the park is Flushing–Main Street on Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue in Downtown Flushing, served by the . Long Island Rail Road service on the Port Washington Branch is available at the LIRR station of the same name farther south on Main Street at Kissena Boulevard and 41st Avenue.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nQuezon is a border town of Isabela with the province of Kalinga. It is bordered in the west by the City of Tabuk.\n\nUnlike some parts of Isabela like Santiago City, Echague and Alicia the history of the municipality of Quezon is relatively recent. The former municipalities have long been seats of rich and colorful historical events that influenced the lives of the people of Isabela since its creation on May 1, 1856 through a Royal Decree issued in honor of Queen Isabella II of Spain (reigned 1843 to 1868). It was in these very places where decisions that ultimately governed the lives of the local people were made by Spanish authorities.\n\nPrior to its creation, Quezon was once part of a vast track of agricultural land called the Mallig Plains. At that time, the area that is now under the political jurisdiction of the municipality was sparsely populated. Historians believe that the precursor of the present inhabitants of Quezon were the Igorots and the Kalingas of the Cordilleras. Although the Igorots and the Kalingas are primarily upland dwellers, historians have observed that these natives come down from the highlands from time to time to hunt for low-landers especially the \"Kanyaw\" rituals.\n\nWhen Manuel L. Quezon was elected as the President of the Philippine Commonwealth, one of his administration's main programs was to promote development in the other areas in the country aside from Manila. In order to achieve this objective, President Quezon opened up vast uninhabited areas for settlement hoping that these would be developed by those who will decide to settle in those areas. Aside from Mindanao, other parts of Luzon were similarly offered for settlement and development including the province of Isabela, particularly the north-western portion of the province which was later called Mallig Plains.\n\nCiting for the potential of the area for settlement and agricultural development, President Quezon declared the entire land area of Mallig Plains as project site for his program on rural development. In support of this declaration, he created the Office of National Land Settlement Administration which was renamed to Land Settlement Development Corporation (LaSeDeCo). Subsequently, this corporation was reorganized. At that time, the primary objective of LaSeDeCo was basically to oversee and facilitate the distribution of lands to qualified settlers. With the development of this opportunity for rural and agricultural development and with the completion of the Balete Pass Road in the 1920s that runs through the hinterlands of the Caraballo Mountains, hundreds of inhabitants from the Ilocos and Central Luzon regions opted to settle and avail of the program of the government in the Mallig Plains area.\n\nA few years after the declaration of the area as site for settlement and agricultural development, World War II broke out and the region was later placed under Japanese control, Although the extent of damage on properties and the number of lives lost during the war was nothing compared to other areas in the Philippines, early settlers of the region had difficulty rebuilding their lives after the war for they were not spared from the wrath inflicted by the members of the Kalinga tribes from the north.\n\nOne of those who fiercely and bravely fought the onslaught of the Kalinga was Jesus Estrada for whom a barangay was named after him. It was only after the government and leaders of the tribes negotiated and agreed to end hostilities that the threat to the lives of early settlers of the region was eventually dispelled.\n\nWith the attainment of peace and security in the area, the exodus of settlers to the area increased particularly in the area of Barrio Narra where the future site of Quezon is located. But the continued influx of new settlers into the area increased the demand for basic requirements of the local residents. Officials of Isabela, particularly Representative Delfin Albano of the lone district of Isabela saw the urgency and the need to create a new municipality out of Mallig. \"House Bill No. 736\" authored by Albano was later approved by the Philippine Senate and President Carlos P. Garcia in 1959 through \"Republic Act No. 2418\". The name of the municipality was in honor of the last President Manuel L. Quezon who was instrumental in the development of the municipalities of Mallig and Quezon.\n\nHildebrando Pécson was appointed as the first mayor of the newly created municipality from 1960 until 1967 when after his term limit allowed by law then, he was succeeded by Hermogenes Padilla in the 1967 local elections. In 1971 local elections, Gavino Gascon challenged Padilla and was popularly elected by people. In 1976, he was replaced by William Corpuz and was in turn unseated in 1978. Oniate Tabangcura, a former officer of the military replaced Corpuz. When President Ferdinand Marcos was overthrown on 1986 through the 1986 EDSA Revolution, President Corazon Aquino issued and executive order replacing all local executives all throughout the Philippines. Corpuz was appointed as Officer-In-Charge Mayor of Quezon. On 1988 local elections, Gavino Gascon had his seat back, again with popular votes, as mayor of Quezon. He was reelected in the 1992 and 1995 local elections. Due to term limit as stated on the 1987 Philippine Constitution and the Local Government Code of 1991, the position of mayor was left as an open race in the 1998 elections. Lawyer Eduardo Cabantac won as municipal mayor. He was reelected in 2001 local elections Cabantac was again reelected in the 2004 local elections leaving the 2007 local elections as an open race again. Gascon's son Daryl won as mayor in the said election. Daryl G. Gascon was re-elected in 2010 and again in 2013 for his third and last term. In May 2016 Presidential and Local Elections, incumbent Vice Mayor Jimmy S. Gamazon Jr. won as Mayor against incumbent Councilor Eduardo R. Cabantac who wanted to reclaim his former post. In May 2019, incumbent Mayor Jimmy S. Gamazon Jr. won unopposed while his running mate Attorney Jesus V. Poquiz, a three-termer Councilor, handily won as Vice Mayor against Councilor Glenn A. Dulig.\n\nThe municipality of Quezon is one of the 34 municipalities which comprise the province of Isabela. Situated in the north-western portion of the province, it is bounded on the north by the municipalities of Santa Maria and Cabangan, on the south by the municipality of Mallig on the east by the municipalities of Delfin Albano and Santo Tomas all within the province of Isabela; and on the west by the Tabuk City in the province of Kalinga. A landlocked municipality, its absolute location is between 121°32’ to 121°41’ longitude East and 17°14’ to 17°26’ latitude north. Its municipal center is located 17°18'42.90\"N and 121°36'19.59\"E.\n\nIts main access is the Cagayan Valley National Highway that traverses in a general north–south direction virtually slicing the municipality lengthwise and connects it with other municipalities in Isabela. To the east lies a provincial road which links Quezon to the municipality of Santo Tomas, Isabela. Quezon is approximately south of the Cagayan Valley regional center of Tuguegarao City, about east of Tabuk City, the provincial capital of Kalinga province; and about north of Manila, the capital of the Philippines, with an average travel time of 8 to 9 hours by land.\n\nBased from the data from the Municipal Accessors Office, Quezon occupies an area of 268.26 km² or about 2.52% of the total land area of Isabela which is placed at 10,664.4 km². The figure was based on the actual tax mapping conducted by the said office. The same figure was also used in the old town plan of Quezon and was validated by using a digital planimeter. With this figure, Quezon is the 13th largest of the 34 municipalities of Isabela and the 3rd largest out of the 11 municipalities of District 2 (San Mariano being the largest at 1,469.50 km², followed by Aurora at 300.56 km²). It is larger than its neighbors Mallig (133.4 km²) and Roxas (184.8 km²).\n\nQuezon is politically subdivided into 15 barangays.\n\nPoblacion Centro (Settlement 1) consists of Alunan (Southeast Poblacion), Arellano (Northwest Poblacion), Santos (Northeast Poblacion), and Samonte (Southwest Poblacion). The rest of the barangays are rural barangays.\n\nThe municipal landscape of Quezon is characterized by a mixture of relatively flatlands punctuated at certain points by undulating and rolling terrain, with mountain ranges flanking its eastern and western sides. The low-lying hills ad surrounding mountains ranges are slightly dissected by intermittent creeks and waterways, which act as natural drainage avenues of accumulated run off water coming from the uplands.\n\nThe physiography of the municipality falls into two basic categories: an alluvial plain and a mountainous terrain. The central plain, where the Poblacion is located, has an elevation of about 100 meters above mean sea level, and is predominantly characterized by low relief and moderately sloping areas. Three fourths of the town is covered by these flatland which may be considered as a broad alluvial plain with recent depositions and residual soils. These areas are found sandwiched between the eastern and western uplands as well as on the other side of the Sierra Madre foothills.\n\nThe south-western portion is characterized by the low-lying hills with undulating and rolling terrain, having elevations ranging from 90–120 meters above mean sea level. These are basically shale and sandstone materials which dominate the Isabela-Kalinga boundary. The eastern edge, meanwhile forms part of the foothills of the major mountain range in the area and dominates the eastern flank of Quezon. This high relief area has peak elevations of up to 200 meters above mean sea level and is composed primarily of volcanic rocks.\n\nPedologic surveys conducted by the Bureau of Soils Management of the Philippine Department of Agriculture have identified two major soil series or categories in Quezon. These road categories are the Bago Sandy Clay Loam and the San Juan Clay. The San Juan Clay is extensively distributed covering about 113.94 km² or about 60 percent of the municipality. It offers excellent potential for such agricultural land use like onchards, commercial forest, woodland and pasture/ grazing lands. The Bago Sandy Clay Loam on the other hand, covers about or bout 40% of the municipality. This particular type of soil is devoted to lowland rice farming.\n\nThe assessment of the ground water resources by the Philippine National Water Resources Board in the entire province of Isabela was based on existing data on geologic formations, topography, ground surface elevations, precipitation and groundwater levels, all of which are available from the files of various agencies.\n\nBased on the study, Quezon is classified into two categories namely: deep and shallow well areas. Shallow well areas generally consist of recent formations with slopes ranging from zero to three percent. Most of these areas are located at elevations within 50 meters above mean sea level, like alluvial and coastal plains and river valleys. Shallow wells may also have deep-water aquifer and are less susceptible to salt water intrusion. Deep well areas generally consist of sedimentary formations, 90 percent of which are water carriers, These are usually located in slopes reaching up to 10%, usually at elevations of more than 50 meters above sea level. The waters from deep wells are in general, of good quality.\n\nAlmost the entire portion of Quezon is classified as deep well area with a small portion of barangay Barucboc, having the lowest point of elevation in the entire municipality, belonging in the shallow area. Quezon s underlain with sedimentary rock formations the dominant being recent depositions of alluvium. This covers much of the municipality except in the Barucboc-Estrada area which is underlain with sandstone. The unconsolidated nature of the sandstone layers in these areas could account for the relatively shallow depth to the water data, since in general sandstones’ permeability allow good infiltration of water.\n\nClustered development influenced considerably by a grid-iron pattern of road network characterizes the existing land use pattern. Built up areas, which include residential, commercial, institutional areas, parks and open spaces are sporadically located in the 15 barangays including the Poblacion, namely Arellano, Samonte, Santos and Alunan, which comprise the town proper. The total built up areas has an aggregate area of 8.79 km² or 5% of the total land area of the municipality.\n\nAgricultural land cover approximately or 65% of the total land area. Included are rice, corn, tobacco lands, lands devoted to vegetables, peanuts, fruit trees and other crops.\n\nOpen grasslands cover approximately or 28% of the total; however, only a small portion of these are actually being utilized as grazing/ pasture lands while a major portion is left idle.\n\nForest lands cover approximately or 2.5% of the total area and these are located on the eastern portion of the municipality. While the land classification indicates a vast timberland areas of more than 36 square kilometres, these do not appear to be based on the actual land use but rather on tenurial status. That is, public lands are generally termed timberland areas. Water bodies like rivers and creeks occupy an aggregate area of approximately or about 1% of the total land area of the municipality.\n\nLand resources in Quezon could be described as somewhat underutilized given its vast potential for agro-industrial development.\n\nUsing the corona classification scheme, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) has classified the climatic type of Quezon belonging to Type III category. Type III climate is characterized by two seasons which are not very pronounced; a relatively dry season which lasts for an average of five months from December to April, and a wet season from May to November with maximum rain periods towards the last quarter (September to November). This classification system is based on precipitation levels rather than on temperature ranges because the tropical location of the Philippines prevents any significant fluctuation in temperature readings.\n\nAlthough the Sierra Madre flanks boundaries of Quezon, the predominance of relatively flat to moderately sloped area and the absence of imposing peaks prevent orographic precipitation. Quezon, however, is exposed to the monsoonal wind systems and periodic typhoons is a permanent feature.\n\nAs observed and recorded at the Agro-Meteorological station located in Minanga, Iguig, Cagayan, the town received an annual rainfall of , 92.3 percent of which occurs from May to November. Maximum rainfall of occurs in October, while minimum rainfall of occurs in February.\n\nDiurnal variations in temperature readings are minimal, with an annual average of . The hottest month of the year is April with an average of . Temperature extremes however, may dip as low as in January, and may climb to as high as in April.\n\nThe constantly high temperature promotes evaporation in the area which in turn results in humid conditions. Sparingly does the humidity level drop below 69.4 percent which is the minimum level during the month of October, even as it peaks to 94.3 percent during the month of December. The annual average is a high 85.9 percent.\n\nThe population grows tremendously. During the census of 1960, one year after its creation as a municipality, Quezon had a population of only 5,797. Its population increased to 7,271 in 1970 and 8,225 in 1975 with an annual growth of 2.25% and 2.49% respectively. The tremendous increase of population began in 1975 to 1980 where population grows to 9,820 or 3.61% growth rate. Between the 1980s and 1990s, its population grew by 16,280 with an annual growth of 5.18%. Such an increase may be attributed to natural increase and influx of migrants particularly land seekers coming from various provinces (mainly from nearby Kalinga) with the operation of Chico River Irrigation System in 1983 that propelled the agricultural boom of Quezon. Population growth between 1990 and 1995 slowed down to 1.59% with 17,617 on record. The growth rate between 1995 and 2000 regained an increase of 2.66% when the local economy improved due to the concreting of the national highway and the increased remittances of its Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) working as either professionals or skilled workers in various fields in the Middle East, USA, Canada, London (UK), Hong Kong or Singapore.\n\nIn the 2000 census of population by the Philippine Philippine Statistics Authority, the municipality has a population of 20,090. This was about 1.56% of the total population of Isabela which were 1,287,575 for the same year.

The Han Chinese race compose a tiny minority of the population, most of whom are migrants from north of the Philippines. The municipality is peopled by a conglomeration of groups that speak several local languages and dialects. The majority of the population speak Ilocano followed by Pangasinan. This can be attributed to the fact that most of their forefathers came from Ilocos region and Pangasinan. In fact, Barangay Samonte in Poblacion is sometimes referred to as \"Little Pangasinan\" of Quezon, Isabela. Recent data reveal that 87.58% of the total population speaks Ilocano. Kankanaey and Igorot dialect represent 10.85% of the total population. This was attributed to the proximity of Quezon to the Mountain Province area and with the opening of Chico dam that made this downstream municipality as its irrigation's beneficiary. The rest of the household speaks other dialects such as Itawanes, Ibanag and others. As required in the field of commerce and education. Most residents are multi-lingual with Tagalog and English as their secondary and tertiary mode of communication.\n\nAn estimated 61.22 percent of the municipal population were Roman Catholics.

These sectors represent the different groups of economic activity. In most cases, these sectors are interlinked. One sector supports one or more sectors and vice versa. The performance of one sector depends greatly on its linkages with other sectors besides its own viability. This has a significant bearing on the sustainability of employment, an important indicator to measure the performance of a specific sector in particular and the economic status of the municipality in general.\n\nThe municipality of Quezon is primarily an agricultural community. Majority of the population depends upon agriculture for their livelihood and income. The office of the municipal agriculturist reveals that there was a total of 58.17 km² of agricultural lands.

Average yield was 5.5 metric tons or 110 cavans per hectare for irrigated lands and 4.0 metric tons or 80 cavans per hectare for rain fed areas. Value wise, the total palay production with a farm gate price of 10 pesos per kilogram amount to not less than 252.12 million. The average yield has been computed in dry weight basis of 14% moisture content and the weight per cavan of 50 kilograms.\n\nCorn is the secondary source of cereal requirement of the municipality.

Except for some cattle at Abut, Callanguigan and Minagbag as well as carabaos at Minagbag where animals are raised for sale, these animals are used more as work animals in tilling the land for agricultural and hauling farm products. These big animals (3,812 heads for cattle and 2,627 heads for Carabao) are grown/ maintained more as farm-helps rather than for commercial purposes. Some cattle however are good source of fresh milk and meat for local consumption. The work animals play an important role in land preparation for planting crops and hauling products especially those families who can't afford to buy hand tractors.\n\nThe hogs and goats numbering 7,664 and 977 respectively serve as part of the livelihood for additional income and supplementary source of protein for local residents. It is seldom that hogs and goats are sold in commercial scale outside the municipality. Only few barangays keep horses. These animals are mostly found in barangays Abut and Lepanto. They are used for transporting farm produce and as a means of transporting some residents. All barangays kept dogs as house pets. In the 15 barangays, there are a total of 4,615 dogs.\n\nOn the other hand, poultry which is composed mostly of native chicken and duck species, are not grown in commercial quantity. Except for barangay Estrada and Minagbag where some ducks are branded in the farm as layers, the poultry products are intended for local consumption only. While a number of household sell some of the birds to their neighbors and the local town market to supplement family income, most are limited to family consumption.\n\nSome farms in almost all barangays are engaged in tilapia culture through backyard fish pen as their supplementary source of food and income. There are around 15 hectares of backyard fish pens and 28.5 hectares of commercial fishing grounds along the river, dam and creeks.\n\nA good potential source of food protein and supplementary income, fish culture, not only tilapia species must be encouraged, Fish are grown together with palay on rice fields with sustained irrigation water through rice-fish culture schemes. Some species such as mudfish and catfish can be raised even without any input or feeding as long as there is adequate water.\n\nThe commercial activity in Quezon is concentrated within and around the perimeter of the Public Market. It is the primary source of staple and convenience goods and services for the Poblacion and neighboring barangays. In the public market and around the commercial district are retail and wholesale trade, small-scale restaurants (carinderias), videoke bars, mini-stores (sari-sari stores) and a number of other businesses of trading establishments.\n\nThe public market in the Poblacion area is considered as the economic center of Quezon. A well-paved Cagayan Valley Highway connects it to Santiago City in Isabela and Tuguegarao City in the Cagayan province. Moreover, it is connected to other barangays of the municipality by municipal and barangay roads.\n\nThe majority of the mini-stores (sari-sari stores) are established near the roads sporadically spread in many barangays of Quezon. Most stores are characteristically just an extension of the main house. Many of the small booths of wood are galvanized with nipa roofing. They are situated near the house of the owner.

Practically all barangays have varying numbers of sari-sari stores with Arellano, Barucboc, Minagbag, Abut, Lepanto, Alunan, and Santos having the most.\n\nAside from the ambiguity of mini-stores (sari-sari stores), Quezon is also known for its thriving balut industry, Out of a total of 290 establishments, 15 are into balut production. There are only two barangays where this particular activity is found and these are Minagbag in the north and Alunan in the south. Since the most dominant economic activity in the area is rice farming it would do the farmers well if they could venture into this type of enterprise since this will provide additional income for them.\n\nThere are also industries, which transform raw materials into final goods. These industries include a vinegar factory and a wood, and bamboo furniture and hut processing plant in barangay Santos, as well as rattan shop in Barucboc. Another major observation that can be obtained from the distribution of business enterprises in the municipality is the presence of activities that caters to the needs of the agricultural sector or the personal needs and requirements of residents. For instance, there are four business activities concentrated in barangay Arellano, which supply agricultural equipment from nearby municipalities such as Mallig and Roxas. This condition is brought about by the fact that some farmers especially in barangays quite distant from the Poblacion such as Turod and Barucboc have accessibility problems. It was learned also that some business establishments in nearby municipalities provide financial assistance to these farmers, which make farmers gravitate toward these other centers. To cater to the personal needs of the local residents, there are a number of business activities, which provide such services as photo supplies, beauty parlors and video rentals.\n\nThere are 31 industrial establishments in operation within the municipality. These are categorized as agro-industries, manufacturing or service-oriented industries. The concentration of industrial activities is in grains processing.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality of Ramon has a semi-radial but more defined linear development along the national road from Santiago City in the south to San Mateo towards the north. With the completion of the Magat River Multi-purpose high dam at Barangay General Aguinaldo, near the Isabela-Ifugao provincial boundary, trend of expansion has deviated westward.\n\nIn the middle of nowhere (1925-2016) when the San Jose–Santa Fe national road opened, Ilocano migrants from the Central Plain of Luzon like Tarlac, Pangasinan, and Nueva Ecija, arrived in bull carts to settle on this vast area covered with weeds called “\"samon\"” as homesteaders. As required by statutes, these people stayed right on their farms to clear the lot in order call it their own. The place was a part of Buenavista, the oldest barrio of Santiago, Isabela. For more than ten long years amidst hardships and sufferings due to malaria disease and unfavorable weather conditions, the pioneers labored to convert their homestead into a productive farm with palay as their main crop.\n\nAt the latter part of the thirties (1937), the Santiago–Santa Maria road via Mallig Plains was opened and more immigrants came to farm in the place. This area which is away from the town proper of Santiago later emerged to become barrio Bugallon, eventually becoming the biggest barrio of Santiago.\n\nThe completion of the Maris Dam at Oscariz in 1957 attracted more migrants to farm at the irrigated areas of Bugallon. Along with the Ilocano arrivals were few Tagalogs, Pangasinenses, and many others.\n\nThe municipality of Ramon was created on June 18, 1961, by virtue of Republic Act No. 3320 sponsored by the then Congressman Delfin Albano of the then lone district of Isabela. On November 12, 1963, the first set of local officials were elected with Angelino F. Vizcarra as Municipal Mayor.\n\nThe original seat of government was first conceived to be established 500 meters north of Barangay Burgos. However, the local officials decided to temporarily locate the site at Bugallon which eventually became the permanent site by virtue of Republic Act No. 11354, upon which a two storey Municipal Hall was built on December 8, 1968.\n\nThe municipality was named in honor of Don Ramon Elento and was originally classified as a seventh class municipality at the time of its inauguration on January 1, 1964. Ramon had 12 original barangays carved out from the municipalities of San Mateo and Santiago. In 1966, another barangay was annexed from the municipality of Echague. Later, by virtue of the revised Barangay Charter or Republic Act. No. 3590, six additional barangays were created.\n\nThe rural Electrification Program of ISELCO I was completed in the later part of the seventies (1976–77).\n\nAnd, with the completion of the Magat High Dam in 1983, more areas were converted into irrigated rice lands which attracted more and more people from all places to migrate to the municipality, including Igorots and Ifugaos from the hinterlands.\n\n\nIn the , the population of Ramon, Isabela, was people, with a density of .\n\nEndowed with prime agricultural lands, the majority of its inhabitants derive their income from agriculture. Ramon ranks among the top rice-producing towns of Isabela alongside the towns of Alicia and San Mateo.\n\nThe northern border of Ramon is the Magat River that provides power to national grid though the Magat Dam. The dam is a major employer in Barangay General Aguinaldo and has the works buildings and staff compounds situated there also. An undeveloped airport is in the area next to the river.\n\nRamon functions as a satellite town of Santiago City, a major growth center in southern Isabela. The Magat River Multi-purpose project, likewise, provides the municipality economic and social gains brought about by the influx of technological advancements like irrigation and electric power.\n\nSince 1948, Ramon was a mission of Santiago. It was 1978 that Ramon had a resident priest and it was only March 28, 1981 that then Bishop Miguel G. Purugganan, canonically erected this town into the status of a parish with Fr. Conrad Blanchet, MS as its first official parish priest.\n\nFormer Bishop Sergio L. Utleg, D.D., the Ordinary of the Diocese of Ilagan (now the Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Tuguegarao), offered the Parish of San Roque to remain under the \"\"in perpetuum\"\" care of the Missionaries of Our Lady of La Salette. The Provincial Superior, in deliberation with his Council, accepted the offer in its 94/04 decision in their meeting June 29, 2004. With this event, the Town of Ramon is now the only remaining parish entrusted to the Missionaries of Our Lady of La Salette.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality is the center of business and commerce in the Mallig Plains Region.\n\nEarly settlers were the Kalingas who originated from adjacent places in Mountain Province and some part of Kalinga-Apayao. Despite occasional clashes with Kalingas, Ilocano people settled in this area of the province, and increased their number with an influx from Ilocanos from Central Plains of Luzon and Ilocos Region.\n\nThe place used to be called Bindang (Bayani), and was part of the La Provincia del Valle de Cagayan (present day area of Cagayan to Nueva Vizcaya). But in 1839, two new provinces were created by the Spanish conquistadors dividing the La Provincia del Valle de Cagayan into two. One retained the name Cagayan, while a new province of Nueva Vizcaya was created. Bindang was dissolved as Barrio Vira under the municipality of Gamu, Isabela.\n\nIn 1938, the area of Mallig Plains was set aside by the National Land Settlement Administration (NLSA) under Settlement No. 2 due to the construction of another National Highway project of President Manuel L. Quezon that passes through the area. But World War II interrupted the implementation of the highway so it remains uncemented for many years. After the war, provincial leaders saw the potential of Barrio Vira as an independent town.\n\nOn July 1, 1948 President Elpidio Quirino established Executive Order 136 creating Barrio Vira as an independent municipality named \"Roxas\" to honor his predecessor Manuel A. Roxas who just died a few months back. It was then inaugurated on July 4, 1948, and Rafael Lintao became its first mayor.\n\nIn 1952, the barrios of Holy Friday, San Jose (East), and San Jose (West) were transferred to the newly created town of Mallig. In 1957, the barrios of Callang, Eden, Babanuang, Cabaritan, Santa Cruz, Malalinta, Mararigue, Calaocan, and Caraniogan were separated to form the municipality of Callang, now San Manuel. In the same year, the barrio of Basilio was renamed to San Jose.\n\nThe municipality of Roxas is one of the 34 municipalities comprising the wide province of Isabela. It is exactly located on the central-western part of the province, bounded in the north by the municipality of Mallig, on the north-east by the municipality of Quirino, on the east by the municipality of Burgos, on the south by the municipality of San Manuel all within the province of Isabela and on the west by the municipality of Paracelis in the province of Mountain Province.\n\nThe road traversing the municipality of Roxas is the Maharlika Highway or better known as Cagayan Valley Road, connecting to other towns in Isabela particularly the adjacent towns of Gamu, Quirino, Mallig and San Manuel. The southern tip of Cagayan Valley Road connects the town to Manila, which is 9 to 10 hours travel by land and to other southern provinces like Nueva Ecija, Pangasinan and Bulacan.\n\nRoxas lie on a flat fertile land between the two valleys of Cagayan. It occupies an area of or 2.01% of the total land area of Isabela. The town is partly urban, and partly rural. The urban area is expanding rapidly throughout the years making it a future city. The rural part of the town compose mainly of rice fields.\n\nThe landscape of Roxas is relatively compose of flatlands with minimal rise at certain point with base mountain elevations on the eastern part, on the parts of \"Sinamar\", \"Simimbaan\" and \"San Placido\". It is approximately 90% of the land area comprising the town can be described as low-lying hills with rolling terrain and an elevation of 200 feet or 61 meters above sea level. The town is dissected by creeks, river and waterways acting as natural drainage from waters coming from the uplands. The \"Siffu River\", a connection from \"Ilog ng Cagayan\"(Cagayan River) traverse west ward from its diversion from Paracelis to Tuguegarao City supplying the rice fields with irrigation.\n\nThe center of the town is relatively low relief of flatlands, while the south-western and north-western part having moderately sloping areas comprising the foothills of Mountain Province.\n\nUsing the corona classification scheme, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) classified Roxas' climatic type as to Type III category. Type III Climate is characterized by no pronounced seasons, but often drier from November to April and wet season from May to October like any other parts of the country. Roxas is described as Cloudy especially during summer time with an average wind of 1 mph to 3 mph.\n\nThe temperature of Roxas is very rare to change but it varies minimally with an average temperature ranging from 23.4 °C to 23.9 °C. The hottest months of the year are April and May with an average of 27 °C, but it can reach as low as 17 °C in January. People can describe the temperature as hot weather, due to its close proximity to the hottest points of the Philippines, like Quezon in Isabela and Tuguegarao City in Cagayan. The data was gathered using weather station RPLC, above Roxas, Isabela.\n\nRoxas is politically subdivided into 26 barangays. Below is the breakdown of its population as of August 1, 2015. Highlighted are the Poblacions.\n\nIn the , the population of Roxas, Isabela, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe existence of the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) System in the municipality that provides water supply services in irrigating farmlands makes the locality a prime agricultural community. The presence of these services makes the agricultural workers the highest in number. The agricultural productivity of Roxas is high, reaching as much as 95 percent cultivation rates in rice and corn. Surplus production of rice and corn are being exported to other places. Other crops are vegetables, tobacco and root crops in which production is just sufficient for local consumption. Likewise, the production of meat including pork and poultry is just sufficient but the supply of fish of other kinds aside from the harvest of inland fishpond owners within the locality is dependent on the arrival of supply coming from other places.\n\nIn the area, rice is the predominant crop, planted twice a year. The livelihood opportunity is very limited thus,a year-round planting of vegetables is practiced to sustain additional income for the settlers. Farm labor is highly utilized and low productivity was experienced because of manual farming. As such, during peak of drying, farmers are compelled to sell their produce freshly threshed which commands lower price. In 2009, the government provided P3 million financial assistance for the \"Mestizo 1\" hybrid seeds planting and for the establishment of needed agricultural components for Farming improvements. With the Local Government Unit’s strong support, cooperative members embarked on hybrid rice production starting as early as 2007-2008 wet season cropping and followed through the next dry season using 40-percent organic fertilizer.\n\nRoxas municipality prides itself as the \"pioneer\" in hybrid rice production in the province of Isabela with the farmers now producing their own M1 hybrid seeds. The farmers who belong to three irrigators associations in barangays Simimbaan, Casilbagan and Tanap Progreso, have organized themselves into a cooperative called Simca Model Cluster MPC under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture. The rice cluster operation is an extension strategy in reaching farmers and extending assistance to achieve increased productivity, food sufficiency and job generation. This is initiated in support to the Ginintuang Masaganang Ani (GMA) Rice Program of then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\nAside from hybrid rice enterprise, they also venture on fishery. Through the Bureau of Fishery and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), the cluster coop had dispersed fingerlings to initial 23 fishery cooperators who have backyard fishpond and rice-fish integrated farming.\n\nSince 2007, Roxas is notable for being most progressive town in Mallig Plains Region. It has the most number of banks such as BDO, Metrobank, Landbank, BPI, PNB, Chinabank, EastWest Bank, Producers Bank, FICO Bank, Rural Bank of Cauayan, Banco Agricola, Inc., Mallig Plains Rural Bank and other non-major banks.\n\nRoxas has the largest market in the Mallig Plains Region due to its continuous expansion after its 1987 construction. The market place is an organized area by which dry goods, wet market, toy stores and commercial stores are separated from each other. It offers a variety of products that is enough to provide the needs of the residents. Also, settlers from nearby municipalities of San Manuel, Quirino, Burgos, Mallig, Quezon and as far as Paracelis in Mountain Province are able to purchase their commodities from Roxas.\n\nMultinational retail companies like Puregold and Savemore Market have opened in the recent years. There are also notable homegrown investors like XentroMall that houses fast food chain like Mang Inasal and stores like Pandayan Bookshop, Handyman, and Robinsons Appliances. Fast food chains like Jollibee, Chowking and \"Chic Boy\" have opened their respective stand-alone stores in the town.\n\nThe municipality of Roxas belonging to the Fifth Legislative District of Isabela is governed by a chief executive and a municipal council.\n\nOver the past two years, when Dr. Harry G. Soller took the helms of government as its Municipal Mayor, Roxas has seen an unprecedented pace in its infrastructure development. The local government, in cooperation with then Governor Grace Padaca and Congressman Edwin Uy, has concreted 20 kilometers of roads, more or less, in the town proper as well as in the barangays. As of March 2010, at least 10 kilometers of roads are programmed to be concreted. Moreover, Roxas' public places, and parks have been greatly improved. New parks include the Barangay Park, which features 26 nipa huts put up by each of the barangays of Roxas; the Roxas Municipal Park and Freedom Stage, which features a comfort room, a Pasalubong Center, a Center Gazeebo with a fountain, and other park amenities; the Forest Park in front of the municipal hall; the Binibining Roxas Park; the Rizal Park; and the newly improved Children's Park. The latter was further improved by the then Mayor, Benedict Calderon in 2011.\n\nOther infrastructure projects include the renovation of the municipal hall, the construction of a new module in the public market, the new vegetable trading post (Bagsakan Center), numerous flood control projects, road widening projects, and many others. Also, a future Grand Terminal for bus, jeepneys and public utility vans is at plan and will have its location in Rizal.\n\nIn January 2011, Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Field Office 02 Regional Director Arnel B. Garcia personally handed a check amounting to P7 million pesos on January 4, 2011 to the LGU-Roxas for the construction of 100 core shelter units. On December 28, 2011, the Local Government Unit of Roxas avails 1,000,000.00 thru the Local Government Support Fund, wherein the said amount was used to purchase lot in Baranggay San Placido. The said lot was utilized for the Core Shelter and Resettlement Program for the 100 less privilege families and those affected by typhoon Juan. In 2013, incumbent Mayor Benedict Calderon launched the Core Shelter Assistance Program in the area now called, \"Sitio Benito\" wherein the awarding of certificate of acceptance to the indigent families was held.

This houses different events which include \"Isabela Got Talent\", a talent competition participated by contenders around Isabela and many more entertainment events.\n\nRoxas is composed of mainly municipal and baranggay roads. A 22 kilometer National Road known as the Maharlika Road(Cagayan Valley Road) extends northward to the adjacent municipality of Mallig and to the province of Cagayan. The southern par extends to the adjacent municipality of San Manuel and provides the link to the cities of Santiago City and Manila. Roxas also has one provincial road from the center of the town extending eastward to the adjacent municipalities of Burgos, Gamu and Ilagan City.

It is located 60 km south of Mumbai, in Raigad District of Maharashtra state in western India.\n\nIn 1508, the Egyptian Mamluks, allied with the Gujarat Sultanate vanquished the Portuguese in the Battle of Chaul. The first Portuguese settlement at Chaul took place in 1521 with the construction of the first fort on the south bank of the Kundalika River. In October 1531, the Portuguese erected a new square stone fortress, named \"Santa Maria do Castello\", which contained a church and dwellings for 120 men. A town developed around the fortress, but a 1558 treaty precluded fortifying the town. The town was destroyed in a 1570-71 siege by the Nizam Shahi Sultan of Ahmadnagar, but a treaty was concluded which lifted the siege, and the town was rebuilt and surrounded by walls and bastions. A fort (Korlai fort) was built on the Morro de Chaul, a rocky promontory on the north side of the river opposite the town. The town withstood several further attacks, and its defence works were expanded in 1613.\n\nChaul was part of Portuguese India's Northern Province, which by the mid 17th century extended for 100 km along the coast of present-day Maharashtra and Gujarat, from Chaul in the south to Daman in the north. The headquarters of the northern province was at Baçaim (modern Vasai) north of Bombay. \n\nDuring the later 17th and early 18th centuries Portuguese India declined economically and politically, and Chaul lost its former importance. As the power of the Mughal Empire declined in the early 18th century, the Marathas expanded their control of central and western India. The Portuguese colony of Kalyan was captured by the Marathas in 1720, and in 1737 the Maratha general Angria began a concerted campaign to capture the remaining Portuguese territories. Chaul and the Morro de Chaul came under siege in March 1739, but the siege was raised in October. After the capture of Baçaim in 1740, a peace treaty was concluded, and on 18 September 1740, Chaul was ceded by treaty to the Marathas. The city was subsequently abandoned and left in ruins.\n\nThe village of Korlai, near the ruins of Chaul, is still home to speakers of Portuguese Creole.\n\n\n"}

There are seven towns in Isabela named after its founders but used prefix \"San\" (Saint) to remove the idea of being self-serving.\n\nIn the old days, the present site of San Agustin, Isabela was a hinterland inhabited by headhunting Ilongots and some scattered bands of Aetas locally known as \"Pogot\". It was then a part of the municipality of Echague. From this historic town sailed forth a band of intrepid pioneers led by Juan Gumpal, Antonio Pintang, and Vicente Taguiam. They penetrated the wilderness and explored the rich valleys along both sides of the Cagayan River. They put up scattered settlements which were often plagued by malaria, and the marauding Ilongots and Pogots but the brave pioneers stayed put and in the end they were able to befriend Ilongots and Aetas and at the same time they were able to lick malaria. Not long after the scattered settlements grew into sitios and one of them was Lakay-lakay (named after the creek) on the western side of the Cagayan River. The place is now \"Masaya Centro\", the seat of the municipal government of San Agustin.\n\nWhen Jones was organized into an independent municipality in 1921, 30 barrios were separated from the municipality of Echague and one of them was Masaya. Because all the barrios of Jones prospered beyond the inhabitants' expectations and since there were no good roads connecting the barrios at that time, the people of Masaya and adjoining barrios petitioned the President of the Philippines to organize the barrios into a regular town.\n\nIn 1959, the barrio of Uldogan was renamed Laoag.\n\nIt is the home of the \"Nuang Festival\" the annual celebration in honor of the sturdy carabao and in recognition of the highly successful Carabao Upgrading Program of the local government, through the Office of the Municipal Agriculturist and its cooperating agencies and stakeholders.

It constitutes 13.78 percent of the total land area of the Province, and is the province's largest and the country's third largest municipality.\n\nThe municipality lies in the eastern part of the Province of Isabela. It is bounded on the north by the Ilagan City, on the east by the Municipality of Palanan, on the south by the Municipality of San Guillermo and on the west by the Municipality of Benito Soliven. It is approximately from Metro Manila and from Ilagan City, the provincial capital.\n\nToday, San Mariano is continuously being developed, road constructions and other infrastructure project is already being implemented.\n\nSan Mariano is politically subdivided into 36 barangays.\n\nOf the total land area of the municipality, built-up area constitutes 1,268 hectares or 0.86 percent with the Poblacion as the largest and most densely populated built-up area. Open grasslands occupy a total area of approximately 20,700 hectares representing about 14.09 percent. Generally, the open grasslands are flanked by either agricultural areas or forest areas. Vast forest areas of the municipality are mostly found at its eastern portion, which covers about 53.39 percent or an approximated area of 78,450.50 hectares. About 29,264 hectares or 19.91 percent are presently devoted to extensive agricultural activities with corn, rice and bananas as the major crops. Water bodies, including banks, buffer or salvage zones occupy an estimated 11.58 percent while existing roads and streets cover 2.17 percent of the municipality’s total area.\n\nLegend has it that San Mariano was once a barrio of Ilagan, the capital city of the province of Isabela. It was first named as Angela in reference to Mariano Kalingog whose family was one of the foremost settlers of the place. Angela was drowned while she was washing clothes along the Pinacanauan River. The incident brought grief to the people and her husband Mariano who also died some years later. Since then, this village teeming with fish and lush trees was known as San Mariano.\nIn 1920, by virtue of Executive Order 25, San Mariano became a Municipal District and with the passage of Philippines Legislature Act No. 3416 dated December 7, 1927, it was made a distinct and regular municipality.\n\nAfter some years, there was an influx of migrants coming from the provinces of Ilocos, Cagayan and Pangasinan. These new settlers formed communities in tracks of agricultural lands on which they grew corn and other crops such as rice, root crops, different kinds of vegetables and bananas.\n\nRecords also show that when a German naturalist named Carl Semper hiked the Sierra Madre mountains in May 1860, he observed early inhabitants who are known today as the Kalingas. He described the said group as a typical Filipino “cultural minority” who grew their own food, practiced their own religious rites, smithed their own tools, decorated their own artifacts with distinctive designs and traded forest products for metal and salt.\n\nOn the pacific side of the mountains, Semper saw the “Negritos” and concluded that they were new arrivals because he observed no “Kalinga-Negrito” mestizos among them. They inhabited the forest close to the “Kalinga” settlements and showed up with games in seasonal periods to barter for agricultural products. Years later, some sociologists noted that there were inter-marriages entered into between these tribes.\n\nThese natives, however, were out-numbered by the mestizos or the “Ibanag-Kalinga,” the pure Ibanags and Ilocanos with a ratio of about four to one. These settlers tilled permanent farms at a place which is now known as Barangays Disulap and Minanga.\n\nThere was also an influx of several groups from the Bicol and Tagalog regions during the logging concession boom. The continuing acculturation of these groups brought about social changes in the locality. The once verdant forest slowly became barren and denuded with the ceaseless illegal logging and kaingin system employed by the local people and new migrants. When the national government decided to impose a total log ban, the ethnic groups decided to settle in the remote areas of the municipality to farm their lands. The Bicolanos and Tagalogs, on the other hand, went back to their own regions.\n\nIn the , the population of San Mariano, Isabela, was people, with a density of .\n\n"}

A proposal has been suggested by scholars to make a separate UNESCO inclusion for the \"Old Centre of Tumauini which includes the Tumauini Church\". The same would be made for other churches listed in UNESCO's tentative sites, where each town plaza and surrounding heritage buildings would be added. No government agency has yet to take action on the proposal.\n\nTumauini is located at the northern portion of the province of Isabela. Its land area is or 5.62% of the total land area of Isabela. It is bounded on the north by the municipality of Cabagan and south from Tuguegarao (the Regional Center); on the east by the municipality of Divilacan, on the south by the City of Ilagan, the capital of Isabela ( away) and north from Manila; on the west by the Cagayan River and the municipality of Delfin Albano.\n\nTumauini is politically subdivided into 46 barangays. Four (4) of which compose the center of the city whereas the other forty two (42) are in the outlying areas. Some of them are even several kilometers away from the center of the municipality.

It is said that when some Spaniard wanted to know the name of the trees, they asked a native saying, \"\"Como se llama el grande lenia? Sabes tu?\"\" The native not knowing what the Spaniards said, picked the last word he heard and answered \"Tumauini\".\n\nIn 1952, the barrios of Barucbuc, Siempre Viva, Bimmonton, Pasurgong, Manga, and Settlement No. 1 were transferred to the newly created town of Mallig.\n\nIn 1957, the barrios of San Antonio, San Juan, Ragan Sur, Ragan Norte, Ragan Almacen, San Jose (Bulo), San Patricio, Quibal, San Andres (Lattu), Calinawan Sur, Bayabo, Santor, Santo Rosario, Andarayan, Aneg, San Isidro, Mawi, San Roque, Carmencita, Aga, Villa Pareda, Villaluz, San Pedro, Concepcion, Sammabario and San Nicolas and the sitios of Turod, Paco, Calamagui and Kim-malabasa, were separated from the municipality of Tumauini to form the town of Magsaysay.

Aside from agriculture being the main backbone of the town's economy, commerce and trade also became the second economic-based income of the town and its residents with the opening of numerous business establishments, hotels and financial institutions that generated many opportunities and more employment for its residents. In 2015, SM Prime opened its first branch of Savemore Market in the town along National Highway while Puregold, a large retail chain opened its first Puregold Price Club Store in the same year. Multi-national fast food chain like Jollibee opened their first branch in the area in 2017. Other fast food chains like McDonald's and Mang Inasal will soon put up their branches which will be located in Xentro Mall, the town's first mall. Banking institutions like BDO Unibank, Development Bank of the Philippines, Producers Bank, FICO Bank and other smaller financial institutions put up their branches in the town which is a good indication that the town is gearing towards rapid commercialization. In 2019, another fast food chain like 7-Eleven is already open.\n\nThis quiet town boasts of a famous historical landmark, the Tumauini Church. Built in the 1780s by the Dominicans, the church has a unique cylindrical bell tower made of bricks. Also one of the popular tourist attraction of the town is the Camp Samal Resort and Leisure Park where known as a semi-Tagaytay because of being high on its location where can view the entire town in the west, south and north and the Cordillera Sierra Madre in the east.\n\nThe Parish Church of San Matias was built in the 1780s by the Dominicans. This is the best-preserved church ensemble in Isabela although its convento is in ruins. The church can be considered to be the best and most artistic brick structure in the Philippines. The delicate brickwork is evident in the church itself and also in the cylindrical, confectionery-like bell tower (a later addition). In the convento's vaulted ceiling may still be seen impressions of the mats that were used as forms to mold wet plaster during construction. A low, undulating brick wall circumscribes the front garden. [PDI, Dec 16, 2001]\n\nFirst build of light materials by Francisco Nunez O. P., and dedicated to the Patron Saint, 1707. Separated from Cabagan and became a regular parish in 1751. The Roman Catholic Church was erected by the Dominican in 1753. They were made of bricks and coral stones with unique cylindrical bell tower, the only of its kind in the Philippines was constructed by Fr. Domingo Forto in 1793 and completed on 1805, became the capital of Isabela for sometimes in 1880′s. The Church was partly damaged during World War II and repaired into original form by the faithful of Tumauini.\n\nFurthermore, the church architectural design bear traces of Chinese artistry which confirms the belief that long before the Spaniards came to the Philippines, the Chinese had settled in the coastal towns of Northern Luzon.\n\nBy virtue of Presidential Decree # 260, 11 August 1973, as amended by Executive Order No. 357, 14 January 1974 and No. 1505, 11 June 1978, the Church of Tumauini was declared a National Historical Landmark on February 24, 1989.\n\nThe historic Camp Samal was the site of the National Jamboree in 1977 and is the home of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines. It is located at the eastern outskirts of the Spanish – built town of Tumauini, on a of elevated mass of rolling hills 500 feet above sea level. It is endowed with natural spring, evergreen grasses, trees and shrubs. It overlooks the Cagayan River, the Pinacanauan River, the town of Tumauini itself, the municipality of Delfin Albano, and the Sierra Mountain ranges.\n\nIts name was derived from the first syllable of the surnames of the spouses, Ricardo C. Sadornas and Purificacion Malana who donated the camp to the Boy Scout of the Philippines in 1954. After the holding of the 1977 National Jamboree, the camp slept for 26 years until the assumption of Arnold S. Bautista in July 2001 as Municipal Mayor, who drew out the support of the government and private sectors for its restoration and development. It is still the favorite destination of the Boy Scout and Girl Scouts of the Philippines for their annual district and provincial encampments. It hosted another big event which is the 5th Northeastern Luzon Regional and Ilocos Region Invitational Jamboree of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines held last November 25 – 30, 2004 with a total of 5,281 participants.\n\nPatronal town fiesta in honor to St. Mathias and the promotion of Tumauini as source of corn and its by-products. Tumauini is also the home of St. Mathias Church, a Spanish brick colonial church (1753) with the only cylindrical belfry in the country and is considered a national cultural treasure.\n\nOne of the most enduring legacies of the Spanish colonial era lives on, quite literally in Tumauini, corn (Zea mays). It was one of the plants that came aboard the galleons and became one of the primary crops of the Philippines. Corn seems to have transcended being a mere crop in Tumauini. The late National Artist for Dance, Ramon Obusan traced the origins of a traditional dance inspired by the crop to Tumauini. Thus, a corn inspired festival seemed especially appropriate for Tumauini.\n\nThreading highways and byways of Antagan 1st is a quiet river which locked a natural beauty, beauty that holds thousands of souls, beauty that makes up life abundant. Magoli River is one of the many prides of Tumauini and considered as the most well-known tourist destination in town because of its perfect location that shows the refreshing view of the mountains and hills. Water from its fresh flowing river gives an unlimited supply of water in many irrigation, farms and households. In its heart lies the invigorating view of Blue Lagoon, a place where you can find inner peace. Blue Lagoon will show you how majestic the work of our creator is. Deep blue water and natural artistic water-shone, curved through time, will be seen in this seen. In the middle of the long running river, there are two life-size rocks called by the natives as \"Kambal na Bato\" which also served as a tourist attraction because of its oddity and beauty that no place can ever have.\n\n"}

In January 1995, the Bahraini government forcibly exiled him to Dubai for leading a popular campaign demanding the reinstatement of the constitution and the restoration of parliament during the 1990s Uprising. From there he made his way to London and sought asylum. He continued opposition activities from London, where he was associated with the Bahrain Freedom Movement. Salman returned to Bahrain in March 2001 in a general amnesty as part of a set of political reforms announced by King Hamad.\n\nAccording to an unknown source close to his family, Sheikh Ali Salman was severely tortured by Al Khalifa regime in prisons.\nNumerous protests were held the detention of Sheikh Ali Salman and several people were injured after the Al Khalifa forces fired tear gas and birdshots to disperse the protesters. Within Al Wefaq he is considered a 'moderate' public face of the organization and has opposed the more confrontational approach with the authorities typical of the other leaders.\n\nAli Salman originally studied in Qom, a major centre of Twelver Shi'a theological thinking in Iran. He is a Twelver Shiite who originally followed the quietist teachings of Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Abul-Qassim al-Khoei, the spiritual leader of much of the Shia world until his death in 1992. Following death of his original Marja’, Salman has not felt compelled to speak publicly about his new Marja’. However, in a private interview he claimed that he now tended to rely on the rulings of Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali al-Husayni al-Sistani.\n\nThis choice is significant as Salman does not rely on an external source of authority to justify his political positioning. This following of Sistani is on a purely individual basis that does not spill over into the public sphere; Sistani is a Marja’ known for avoiding interference in the political choices of his followers.\n\nAli Salman is widely perceived to have been one of the leaders of the 1990s uprising in Bahrain. The starting point of the uprising is described as having been a charity marathon organised in November 1994 by several foreign companies. As the marathon runners, both men and women dressed in shorts and T-shirts, entered some Shia villages, groups of villagers headed by activist clerics tried to stop them, considering that running among them in such light clothing was a direct insult to their religious and moral values. Events disintegrated into fist-fighting and stone throwing. The same night, security forces arrested several of the protesters, including Ali Salman. His arrest sparked a cycle of mass-demonstrations that led to the death of a dozen demonstrators and the incarceration of hundreds of others. Salman was the leader of several of these demonstrations.\n\nFollowing his arrest in 1994, Salman was exiled and made his way to London, where he associated with the Bahrain Freedom Movement, an opposition group led by Saeed al-Shehabi. Salman worked independently from the group but was in cooperation with them in order to achieve the political demands of the Bahrain uprising, mainly by releasing regular communiqués distributed in Bahrain in which they demanded the reinstatement of the Parliament.\n\nSalman is the current official leader of Al Wefaq. His legitimacy as leader is derived from elections that are held every four years in Al Wefaq's General Conference where at least 50%+1 of all members in Al Wefaq elect the Secretary-General, his deputy, the members of both Al Wefaq's Shura Council and Arbitration Board. Salman faces little competition as leader of the movement and is regarded as an inspirational figure. However, the General Conference is the supreme authority in Al Wefaq and is authorized to dismiss the Secretary-General and his deputy.\n\nAl Wefaq's organisational structure includes a Shura Council which is half-elected every two years, so that half of the Council members will keep their positions for a period of four years. The Shura Council is an advisory and monitoring board to the General-Secretariat which is formed by the Secretary-General.\nThe spiritual Godfather for the Wefaqi party is Sheikh Isa Qassim, a senior Bahraini cleric. Sheikh Issa Qassim is the most prominent cleric in Bahrain with the biggest number of followers. This can be clearly seen by comparing the number of people who pray behind him with those who pray behind other clerics. He has proved his ability to contain the anger of the masses that pray behind him and listen to his sermon every Friday. He has been able to spread self-restraint among his followers even in the peak of regime-terror and brutality during the state of emergency in 2011 following the wide Arab-Spring-inspired pro-democracy protests. However, small groups of youth do clash with the police.\n\nPro-regime groups believe that Ali Salman, the formal head of al-Wefaq and also a cleric, is “obeying the orders of Isa Qassim, his former teacher and superior in the clerical hierarchy”. The independence of ‘Ali Salman as the formally elected leader of al-Wefaq is believed to be limited by his obligation, as a cleric who has not yet reached the level of independent reasoning (ijtihad), to submit his decisions to the sanction of a higher-ranking scholar. Because its leadership is considered subservient to an external religious authority, and therefore, they argue al-Wefaq is considered as lacking the transparency for the normal exercise of internal democracy.\nHowever, this claim fails to stand accurate in face of Al Wefaq's public and open strategy. For instance, in 2002, when the parliament was restored after about 30 years of suspension, Sheikh Issa Qassim's publicly declared advise to Al Wefaq was to participate in the elections, but Al Wefaq took a joint-decision with other opposition groups to boycott the 2002 elections in protest of the King's unkept promise to separate the three powers and transit from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy.\n\nSalman was arrested on 28 December 2014. Later on, he was given a life sentence in prison on 4 November 2018.\n\n"}
{"id": "2069837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069837", "title": "Rome (TV series)", "text": "Rome (TV series)\n\nRome is a British-American-Italian historical drama television series created by John Milius, William J. MacDonald, and Bruno Heller. The show's two seasons were broadcast on HBO, BBC Two, and Rai 2 between 2005 and 2007. They were later released on DVD and Blu-ray. \"Rome\" is set in the 1st century BC, during Ancient Rome's transition from Republic to Empire.\n\nThe series features a sprawling cast of characters, many based on real figures from historical records, but the lead protagonists are ultimately two soldiers named Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, who find their lives intertwined with key historical events. \"Rome\" was initially a ratings success for HBO and the BBC, although the numbers declined considerably in the second season. The series received substantial media attention from the start, and was honoured with numerous awards and nominations in its two-season run. The series was filmed in various locations but most notably in the Cinecittà studios in Italy.\n\nThe series primarily chronicles the lives and deeds of the rich, powerful, and historically significant, but it also focuses on the lives, fortunes, families, and acquaintances of two common men: Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, fictionalized versions of a pair of Roman soldiers mentioned in Caesar's \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\". The fictional Vorenus and Pullo manage to witness and often influence many of the historical events presented in the series, although some dramatic license is taken.\n\nThe first season depicts Julius Caesar's civil war of 49 BC against the traditionalist conservative faction in the Roman Senate (the Optimates), his rise to dictatorship over Rome, and his fall, spanning the time from the end of his Gallic Wars (52 BC or 701 \"ab urbe condita\") until his assassination on 15 March 44 BC (the infamous Ides of March). Against the backdrop of these cataclysmic events, we also see the early years of the young Octavian, who is destined to become Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome. The second season chronicles the power struggle between Octavian and Mark Antony following Caesar's assassination, spanning the period from Caesar's death in 44 BC to the suicide of Antony and Cleopatra in 30 B.C. after their defeat at the Battle of Actium.\n\n\nWilliam J. MacDonald and John Milius pitched the idea to HBO as a mini series, but the network made it a full-fledged series. In 2002, HBO and the BBC agreed to co-produce the series, committing a US$100–110 million (£62.7 million) budget to the production of twelve 1-hour episodes, with HBO contributing $85 million, and the BBC contributing $15 million. The BBC contributed £800,000 to every episode of \"Rome\" in its first season. \"Rome\" is the largest co-produced series with the American film market in the BBC's history. The series also marked the first series on which HBO and the BBC worked together as co-producers, although the two companies had worked together in other roles in earlier series, including \"Band of Brothers\" and \"The Gathering Storm\".\n\nTranter from the BBC has said this about the development of \"Rome\": \"It felt like something that could have been developed by us, and HBO felt like natural partners for the BBC\". On 20 April 2006, Carolyn Strauss, president of HBO announced the development of a second season for \"Rome\".\n\nBetween March 2004 and May 2005 \"Rome\" was filmed in co-production with Rai Fiction in the Italian countryside on Cinecittà studios' six sound stages in Rome. A collection of massive sets in Cinecittà studios' back lots comprised an elaborate \"period reconstruction\" of sections of ancient Rome. It was a huge undertaking, with an international crew of 350, and more than 50 local Italian interns.\n\nThe production is regarded as one of the most expensive in the history of television. Funding was generously employed to recreate an impressively detailed set featuring a number of Roman Villas, the Forum, and a vast slum area of the ancient city of Rome. A significant part of this set was later destroyed by a fire that burned down a portion of the Cinecittà Studios in 2007. According to HBO, the fire started after they had finished filming the second season. A portion of the set was also used in late 2007 by the crew of the long-running BBC sci-fi drama series \"Doctor Who\", for the fourth-season episode \"The Fires of Pompeii\".\n\nAudio commentary on the Season 1 DVD indicates that many of the background performers used in the series were also their true professional counterparts. One example is that the actor shown in the series working as a butcher on the streets of Rome was in fact a real-life butcher.\n\nIn a separate move, the BBC also decided to re-edit the first three episodes (all directed by Michael Apted) into two episodes. The BBC claimed that this was because the British audience were more familiar with the history of Rome than their American counterparts and so much of the history was unnecessary; however, Apted claims that the purpose was to boost the ratings by increasing the prominence of the scenes of sex and violence. In an interview with \"The Times\", Apted said:\nI'm really pissed off with the BBC for bringing down my first three episodes to two and, in doing so, taking out much of the vital politics. What also makes me very grumpy is that I was told that the cuts had been introduced by the BBC because they thought British viewers already knew the historical background. But all that's happened as far as the viewer is concerned is that it has made \"Rome\" hard to follow.\nApted also said that he only learned of the edits by accident, \"...a couple of weeks ago when one of the actors told me\". Since then, the original uncut Season 1 episodes aired on UKTV Drama, coincident with the UK broadcast of Season 2 on BBC Two.\n\nThe Italian broadcast of the series was also marred by controversy. Strong language was removed in the Italian dubbing process; as for the more explicit sex scenes and disturbing violence, they were replaced by \"safe\" alternative versions shot during production especially for the Italian market. Rai 4 began showing the \"complete version\" of the series on Italian TV in September 2009.\n\nComposer Jeff Beal was invited to audition for \"Rome\" after he completed work on HBO's \"Carnivàle\". The producers sent him a short edit of season 1 episode 7. From that, Beal began writing a demo score. Based on head writer Bruno Heller's desired gritty pre-Christian feel for the series, and HBO's interest in a non-modern sound, Beal chose to compose and record with live instruments from across the ancient Roman world. For each episode, Beal had about two weeks to work: in the first, he composed for – and recorded – the instruments he performed on the soundtrack. In the second week, he incorporated producer's notes, and orchestrated and recorded the other live instrumental sections.\n\n\"Rome\"'s first season originally aired on HBO in the United States between 28 August and 20 November 2005, subsequently being broadcast on the United Kingdom's BBC Two between 2 November 2005 and 4 January 2006, and on Rai 2 in Italy between 17 March 2006 and 28 April 2006. The second season aired on HBO in the US from 14 January 2007 to 25 March 2007.\n\nThe series was launched in the United States on 25 August 2005, at Wadsworth Theatre in Los Angeles. HBO broadcast the series pilot \"The Stolen Eagle\" four days later. According to the Nielsen ratings system, the pilot broadcast was seen by 3.8 million viewers and achieved a 9.1 household rating for Sunday primetime. HBO re-aired the pilot 11 times in the week following 28 August 2005 premiere, garnering a total viewership of 8.9 million for all 11 airings. After the broadcast of only three first-season episodes, HBO announced plans to produce a second season of \"Rome\" in 2006, for release in March 2007. HBO aired each episode multiple times a week, and by the end of the first season, the total weekly audience for all airings exceeded seven million viewers. The second season premiered in January 2007, with the first episode attracting 1.5 million viewers. The final episode aired 25 March 2007 in the US, garnering 2.4 million viewers.\n\nIn total, HBO spent about $10 million US$ to promote \"Rome\". HBO enlisted the Mozilla Firefox web browser in its marketing campaign for the series by designing a downloadable custom \"Rome\" Firefox theme. BBC Two premiered \"Rome\" in the United Kingdom on 2 November 2005, attracting 6.6 million viewers (27%); viewing figures declined in future episodes, with the season finale only attracting 3 million viewers (13%). The first episode of the second season aired on BBC Two on 20 June 2007.\n\nA \"sanitized\" version of the first series of \"Rome\" – with toned-down nudity and violence – aired on Rai 2 in Italy, garnering only a meager 10% audience share. RAI also stated to have co-produced the show, whereas HBO listed only itself and BBC as co-producers. The Italian newspaper, \"Corriere della Sera\" called it a \"prime example of historical misinformation\", and called actor Ciarán Hinds (Julius Caesar) a \"parody\". The paper also called the relationship between Atia of the Julii (Polly Walker) and Mark Antony (James Purefoy) \"ridiculous\". The second series was never broadcast at all on analog TV; however, starting from October 2009, digital-only channel Rai 4 broadcast the original uncut version of the first series and went on to broadcast the second series unaltered as well.\n\nHBO Chairman Chris Albrecht announced in a July 2006 news conference that season two of \"Rome\" would be its last, citing the fact that the series (called \"notoriously expensive\" by \"Broadcasting & Cable\") had been developed under a two-year contract with the BBC that would have been difficult for the BBC to extend due to the series' cost. Of the storyline, co-creator Heller said:\nIn a February 2008 interview with Movieweb.com, actor Ray Stevenson stated that a \"Rome\" film was in development, with Heller working on a script. Heller confirmed in December that there was \"talk of doing a movie version\", adding that \"It's moving along. It's not there until it is there. I would love to round that show off\". In an April 2009 interview with the Associated Press, actor Kevin McKidd stated the \"Rome\" film was \"in development\", and Lucius Vorenus would likely be a part of it. McKidd said in a later 2009 interview, \"There is a script that is being shopped and it's supposedly very good, I haven't seen it, but I am definitely going to be a part of the movie... He is very much alive, so that should be a fun story to tell.\" In March 2010, \"Entertainment Weekly\" stated that Heller had completed the script for Morning Light Productions, the film's financiers, and was now awaiting a director and a studio, since HBO Films \"won't be involved\". However, in a 2011 interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\", Heller indicated the project had stalled – \"I'm not holding my breath.\" \n\n\"Rome: The Complete First Season\" was released as a six-disc Region 1 DVD box set in the United States in 2006, distributed by HBO Home Video. Featuring all 12 episodes, it included features such as episode commentaries, behind-the-scenes footage and making-of features. The set (without the episodic previews and recaps) was also released in Region 2, with the same title.\n\nSeason 2 was released in North America in 2007 and soon after in Region 2. \"Rome: The Complete Series\" was released in November 2009 on Blu-ray in North America.\n\n\"Rome\" has garnered mostly positive reviews. Sean Woods from \"Rolling Stone\" called the series \"masterful\" and \"epic\", and gave the series 3.5 out of 4. Alessandra Stanley from \"The New York Times\" said: \"But behind all that gritty squalor the glory that was Rome gets lost\", while reviewing season 2. Lisa Schwarzbaum from \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave season 2 a B and commented on the \"spectacular\" clothing design. Michael Ventre from \"Variety\" magazine was positive towards the series and was intrigued by the \"complex\" character of Atia of the Julii. James Poniewozik from \"Time\" magazine commented on the \"slow start\" but further stated that the series \"draws you\" to the ancient city of Rome.\n\n\"Empire\" magazine reviewer Helen O'Hara said: \"Not as good-looking as \"Gladiator\", perhaps, but richer in (reasonably accurate) history and texture\", and gave season 1 of \"Rome\" four out of five stars. Robert Bianco from \"USA Today\" called season 2 \"the fall of \"Rome\"\", commenting that season 2 was not as good as season 1 citing \"off-key characterizations and plot absurdities\". Linda Stasi from \"The New York Post\" called herself a \"slave\" to the show. Melanie McFarland from \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" called season 2 \"at top of its form\" and said it was as good as the former season. Historian Robin Lane Fox, writing in \"The Guardian\", called the series \"splendidly ambitious\". Eric Neigher from \"Slant Magazine\" called season 1 of \"Rome\" \"good art\". Robert Abele from \"LA Weekly\" called it the \"most lavish dramatic series yet\" released by HBO.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 83% based on 36 reviews, with an average score of 8.62/10; the critical consensus reads: \"\"Rome\" builds slowly, but a laborious start delivers rich rewards in the form of decadent sets, delicious drama and a surprising amount of intimacy\". The second season has an approval rating of 89% based on 28 reviews, with an average score of 8.05/10; the critical consensus reads: \"Pulp meets prestige in \"Rome\"’s sensational second season -- though its style sometimes outweighs its substance\".\n\nCapping its successful first season, \"Rome\" won four Emmy Awards out of eight nominations in 2006, for the episodes \"Caesarion\", \"Triumph\", \"Kalends of February\" and \"Stealing from Saturn\". The series also won an Art Directors Guild (ADG) in the category \"Excellence in Production Design – Single-Camera Television Series\" for the pilot episode \"The Stolen Eagle\". Michael Apted won the Directors Guild of America (DGA) in the category \"Outstanding Directing – Drama Series, Night\" for \"The Stolen Eagle\". The series itself was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category \"Best Television Series – Drama\", and Polly Walker who portrayed Atia of the Julii was nominated in the category \"Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series – Drama\". The series was also nominated for three Satellite Awards, two for season 1 and the last for season 2. The pilot episode \"The Stolen Eagle\" won a Visual Effects Society (VES) award in the category \"Outstanding Visual Effects – Broadcast Series\". Writers Guild of America (WGA) nominated the series for the category \"Best Writing – New Television Series\" in 2005. The series was also nominated for four British Academy Television Awards (BAFTA), three in season 1 (2006) and one in season 2 (2008). In 2005, the series was nominated for a Cinema Audio Society Award (CAS) in the category \"Outstanding Achievement in Sound Mixing for Television Series\" for the episode \"The Spoils\". The British award ceremony nominated the series for the Royal Television Society (RTS) award in the category \"Best Visual Effects – Digital Effects\". For season 2 (2007) Alik Sakharov won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, for the episode \"Passover\".\n\nThere are numerous inaccuracies in the series' representation of various historical events and personages. Co-creator Bruno Heller has said: \"We try to balance between what people expect from previous portrayals and a naturalistic approach ... This series is much more about how the psychology of the characters affects history than simply following the history as we know it\". Series Historical Consultant Jonathan Stamp also notes that the show aims for \"authenticity\" rather than \"accuracy\". The filmmakers stressed that they wanted to portray a more accurate picture of Rome, a gritty and realistic city as opposed to what they call the \"Hollyrome\" presentation that audiences are used to from other films, with \"cleanliness and marble and togas that looked pressed.\"\n\nLucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo are historical figures mentioned briefly in Caesar's \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\", but their adventures and involvement in key events in the series are fictional. Some important events are not mentioned in \"Rome\", including the whole year spent before the Battle of Dyrrhachium, which, though indecisive, was considered a victory for Pompeius. Many significant members of the Optimates, the traditionalist faction of Brutus and Cato, are also missing from the series. They include Titus Labienus, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Crus, and Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, who failed to empty Rome's treasury before the \"Optimates\"' departure, resulting in a severe lack of funds to support their war effort.\n\n\n\n"}

As is usual for G8 summits, there were a range of protests.\n\nThe Group of Seven (G7) was an unofficial forum which brought together the heads of the richest industrialized countries: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada starting in 1976. The G8, meeting for the first time in 1997, was formed with the addition of Russia. In addition, the President of the European Commission has been formally included in summits since 1981. The summits were not meant to be linked formally with wider international institutions; and in fact, a mild rebellion against the stiff formality of other international meetings was a part of the genesis of cooperation between France's President Giscard d'Estaing and West Germany's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt as they conceived the initial summit of the Group of Six (G6) in 1975.\n\nThe G8 summits during the twenty-first century have inspired widespread debates, protests and demonstrations; and the two- or three-day event becomes more than the sum of its parts, elevating the participants, the issues and the venue as focal points for activist pressure.\n\nOfficial \"G8 Summit\" magazines which have been published under the auspices of the host nations for distribution to all attendees since 1998; the 2008 edition was published by Prestige Media.\n\nThe G8 is an unofficial annual forum for the leaders of Canada, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThe 29th G8 summit was the last summit for Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien.\n\nThese summit participants are the current \"core members\" of the international forum:\n\nTraditionally, the host country of the G8 summit sets the agenda for negotiations, which take place primarily amongst multi-national civil servants in the weeks before the summit itself, leading to a joint declaration which all countries can agree to sign.\n\nReconciliation amongst the G8 leaders was the top priority in the wake of the beginning of the Iraq War. The G8 had sharply divided over the American-led invasion. Chirac's broad agenda was organized under four main themes — solidarity, responsibility, security and democracy.\n\nThe summit was intended as a venue for resolving differences among its members. As a practical matter, the summit was also conceived as an opportunity for its members to give each other mutual encouragement in the face of difficult economic decisions.\n\nDuring the protests, some manifestations went out of order as Swiss towns have been sacked by rioters. An accident also occurred during protest at the Aubonne bridge in Switzerland between Lausanne and Geneva, in which two activists suspended themselves from the bridge via a rope, with the rope stretching across the bridge, displaying a banner and obstructing traffic on the highway with the highest traffic density of Switzerland. Some protestors were arrested. One of the policemen, unaware people were attached to the rope, cut it. As a result, one of the protestors, Briton Martin Shaw, to plunge 20m into a rocky river and suffered multiple fractures. The other activist, German Gesine Wenzel, was caught by other protestors and could later abseil safely. In a ruling on 17 February 2006 a judge acquitted the two police officers found responsible on the grounds that their actions had been based on \"\"a series of unfortunate misunderstandings\"\" and therefore were not criminal. Indeed, as the anti-G8 manifestations were difficult to handle by their scales and by the seriousness of the disorders they caused many policemen (including the one who cut the rope) came from the German speaking part of Switzerland. The linguistic barriers, added to the stress of the situation (a blocked highway that could have resulted in many deaths) were considered by the court as critical in the misunderstandings that generated the accident.\n\n\n"}

The name Bayombong emanated from the Gaddang word “\"Bayongyong\"” which means confluence of two or more rivers. It has been reported that a certain tribe arrived and tried to invade the place, which caused the outbreak of the first tribal war in the area. The site was renamed “Bayumbung” as a sign of the Gaddangs' first victory in fighting for their private domains.\n\nThe terrain is mountainous dominated by steep hills and mountains encompassing an area of 36.44% of its total land area. Level to gently sloping is 32.03%, rolling to hilly is 8.09% while the remaining 23.44% are very steep mountains. The town was founded at the juncture of the Calocool and Magat Rivers, and has grown to incorporate the Pan-Philippine Highway.\n\nBayombong is politically subdivided into 25 barangays.\n\nIt was in 1739 when Spanish Augustinian Friars named the place \"Bayumbung\", which was later changed into Bayombong. Bayombong was formally founded on June 12, 1739 during the first Mass celebrated in the region, officiated by Father Pedro Freire in a makeshift chapel at the foot of the Bangan Hill.\n\nBayombong came under the administration of Dominican friars as a part of the Paniqui mission pueblo a few months after its founding.

A \"Capitan del Pueblo\" was appointed as the chief executive. In 1982, the town became the seat of the new Diocese of Bayombong.\n\nFrom 1773–1792, Fray Juan Crespo constructed the brick St. Dominic's church, the convent and the cemetery next to the church, and started the octagonal tower. By 1829, Fray Juan Molano finished the tower. In 1880 the church building was damaged in an earthquake, while more than a century later, in 1987, a fire destroyed the church and convent.

In 1930, Bayombong Rural School was re-purposed as Nueva Vizcaya Rural High School (NVRHS), and in 1934 St. Mary's added a high-school department. During the Japanese occupation, high school operations were suspended; they resumed in 1945. In 1947, the St. Mary's College (now St. Mary's University) was established by the CICM near the elementary and high-schools of the same name. In 1956, NVRHS was converted into two programs: Nueva Vizcaya General Comprehensive High School and Nueva Vizcaya National Agricultural School. In 1964 the agricultural school became Nueva Vizcaya Agricultural College, then in 1973 Nueva Vizcaya State Institute of Technology. Presently, the school is Nueva Vizcaya State University.\n\nBayombong is the 1913 birthplace of Roy Anthony Cutaran Bennett (1913–1990), editor of the \"Manila Bulletin\" who was tortured for his outspoken opposition to the Japanese occupation of the Philippines.

The recent aquaculture congress found that the growth of tilapia production was due to government interventions: provision of fast-growing species, accreditation of private hatcheries to ensure supply of quality fingerlings, establishment of demonstration farms, providing free fingerlings to newly constructed fishponds, and the dissemination of tilapia to Nueva Vizcaya (in Diadi town).

At the , it had a population of people.\n\nDupax del Sur is politically subdivided into 19 barangays.\n\nThe name \"Dupax\" comes from the Isinai word \"\"dopaj\"\". By \"\"dopaj\"\" the Isinais, who are the first inhabitants of Dupax, meant \"to lie down in complete relaxation.\" According to folklores that have survived from generation to generation, even long before the founding fathers established the municipality, the site of what eventually became the \"poblacion\", or town proper of Dupax, used to serve as a roaring camp for primitive hunters from surrounding tribal settlements. After hard days of hunting in nearby mountains, the hunters would repair the camp where they would feast on their catch of wild animals. When they were through with their brand of merrymaking \"they would lie down and relax completely\" before getting up again to return to their respective home. The camping area, which was a plain or a valley, was near their hunting grounds that later, they decided to settle on it together with their families and the town of Dopaj was established.\n\nIn time, the town's name metamorphosed into Dupax, after the arrival of the Spaniards who, for convenience, substituted the letter \"\"x\"\" in lieu of letter \"\"j\"\" for easy pronunciation.\n\nThe original town of Dupax is the largest municipality of the province of Nueva Vizcaya in terms of land area. But in 1971, the Congress passed into law Republic Act 6372 otherwise known as \"\"An Act Creating the Municipality of Dupax del Sur from the Municipality of Dupax in the province of Nueva Vizcaya\"\", sponsored by Congressman Benjamin B. Perez in the Philippine House of Representatives and Senator Leonardo B. Perez in the Philippine Senate. President Ferdinand Marcos amended some sections and signed it into law with the promulgation of Presidential Decree 586 on November 26, 1974 which paved the way for the division of Dupax into two municipalities: Dupax del Norte and Dupax del Sur.\n\nThe town hosts the San Vicente Ferrer Church (Dupax del Sur), which is also known as the Dupax Church or Dopaj Church. The heritage structure is an 18th-century Baroque church located at Barangay Dopaj. The parish church, under the advocation of Saint Vincent Ferrer, is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayombong. The church complex has been declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines in July 2001. Its construction was finished in 1776, making it older than other heritage structures in the entire country.\n\nAn earlier church structure of modest design might have been erected before 1773 and records tell that the structure may have been reused as a schoolhouse after the erection of the present church at around 1773 by Father Manuel Corripio, OP. By this time, the church of Tuguegarao by Father Antonio Lobato, OP was already standing. Like the earlier Tuguegarao church, Father Corripio had the church of Dupax made of bricks and even had two kilns made near the church complex, one for firing bricks and the other for preparing lime. The current façade, which mimics the silhouette of the earlier Tuguegarao Cathedral and is reflected on the churches of Bayombong and Bambang in Nueva Vizcaya, dates back to 1776 while each level of the bell tower bears inscription of the years when which it must have been completed. Its original titular patron is the Nuestra Señora del Socorro but was replaced by San Vicente Ferrer soon after the mission was returned to the Dominicans.\n\nThe façade is divided by cornices into horizontal segments of plastered brick. The first level features a semicircular arched main portal embellished with clay insets. The main doorway is flanked on both sides by two blind windows with an embossed image of the Holy Eucharist. The second story features a niche and two windows framed by embossed carvings. The triangular pediment is divided into two horizontal sections with the lower half pierced with a deeply recessed oculus and the upper part featuring a relief of a cross. The entire pediment is capped by undulating cornices and seven finials, with the central finial crowned with a cross.\n\nTo the left of the façade is the four-level, unplastered, rectangular bell tower. The base features saint’s niches similar to that found on the second level of the façade while the second level features long, narrow windows framed with bracket columns. The tower is capped with a decorative parapet and a small cupola surmounted by a cross. The church plaza is enclosed by a low perimeter wall and a replica of an earlier atrial cross.\n\nTwo focal points inside the church are the pillars supporting the choir loft. The two, white-washed pillars are embellished with reliefs of cherubs, shells, florals and arabesques. Similar motifs can also be found on the baptistery. The original main altarpiece and pulpit are still intact but the heads of the images in the altarpiece are believed to be replicas of the ivory ones stolen over the course of the church’s history.\n\nThe Dupax del Sur church is an officially declared \"National Cultural Treasure\" of the Philippines. In 2015, the Dampol Bridge was also declared as a\"National Cultural Treasure\", where both heritage sites were collectively named by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as the \"San Vicente Ferrer Church Complex and Dampol Bridge of Dupax Del Sur\". The declaration remains as the only \"National Cultural Treasure\" declaration in the entire Nueva Viscaya province.\n\nDue to the outstanding cultural value of the town of Dupax del Sur, many scholars have been pushing for its inclusion in the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Philippines.\n\n"}

This further solidified the status of Solano as the undisputed premier town of Cagayan Valley.\nSolano, being the premier town in Nueva Vizcaya and the fastest-growing municipality in the region, is slated to become Cagayan Valley Region's 5th City after Tuguegarao, Santiago, Cauayan, and Ilagan.\n\nSolano is politically subdivided into 22 barangays.\n\n\nIn 1760, the original name of the town was Bintauan. Its pioneer settlers were the Gaddang tribe.\nThe municipality was founded in 1767 by Father Alejandro Vidal, a Dominican priest who led a Spanish mission. In 1768, it was called \"Lungabang\", which means \"cave\" in the Gaddang dialect. The name was later changed to \"Lumabang\" by the Spaniards for convenience.\nIn 1851, Governor General Antonio Urbiztondo declared Lumabang a barrio of Bayombong for not having sufficient inhabitants and revenue to maintain itself. Governor General Ramon Solano y Llanderal authorized the separation of Lumabang as barrio from Bayombong.\nIn 1853, the first Ilocanos arrived brought by Don Diego Lumicao, former Gobernadorcillo.\nIn 1889, it was renamed Solano, in honor of Governor General Ramon Solano y Llanderal.\nThe town was planned by Father Juan Villaverde. The poblacion, as designed, consisted of 14 parallel wide streets, each having a width of 20 meters. The streets run from north to south and east to west forming 100 square blocks with an aggregate area of one hectare per block.\nSolano was the largest municipality in the province until two of its barangays, Caliat and Bintawan, were segregated to become the municipalities of Quezon and Villaverde respectively. The land area of Solano was correspondingly reduced to 13,980 hectares.\nIn 1957, the barrios of Ibung and Bintawan were separated to form the town of Ibung, later renamed as Villaverde.\n\nUnder the Spanish regime, the \"Gobernadorcillo\" commonly called Municipal Mayor, Captain, Petty Governor was a native and elected annually. The election was made by the Cabezas de Barrangay - Heads of Barangay - which represented the survival of the earlier tribal organizations and were responsible for the tributes of their groups. The Heads were originally hereditary, but, in time, it became elective. The electors of the Gobernadorcillo were current or former heads of the Barrangay and after 3 years of service became eligible for the office of Petty Governor.\n\nThe following list shows the Gobernadorcillos, who had the honorary title \"Don\", during the Spanish regime from 1762-1898.\n\nThe following served as capitanes del pueblo:\nThe next three years, the town head was to be known gobernadorcillo, and the use of capitan del pueblo was stopped.\n\n\nThe following served as alcaldes de naturales:\n\n\nOn April 19, 1789, the alcalde mayor [of Cagayan] conveyed to the people the decree issued by the King of Spain ordering the restoration of the title gobernadorcillo.\nBy executive order of 1851, Governor-General Antonio Urbiztondo, Marquez de la Solana, declared Lumabang to become a barrio of Bayombong resulting in the office of gobernadorcillo (Bayombong) and teniente del barrio (of Solano/Lumabang).\nIt was during this time when a new province, Isabela, was created, carving a portion of Nueva Vizcaya and a part of Cagayan. The new province was named in honor of Queen Isabela of Spain. The Governor of Nueva Vizcaya was Julian del Valle. The alcalde mayor of Cagayan came here for the purpose of this reorganization.\n\n\nGeneral Ramon Solano y Llanderal authorized the separation of Lumabang as a barrio from Bayombong restoring the title of gobernadorcillo to Solano/Lumabang\n\n\nThere was a new order at this time to increase the term of a gobernadorcillo from one year to two years.\nIn 1890, the establishment of the office of the justice of the peace was inaugurated in all the towns, and the first to assume this office in Solano was Domingo Panganiban who was in turn succeed by Juan Sobrino, a Spaniard. who was succeeded by Sebastian Panganiban. who was then succeed by Domingo Panganiban who held this office til 1898.\n\nIt was during this time when the Royal Decree of the Central Government came stopping the use of the title gobernadorcillo and in its stead capitan municipal was to be used.\n\n\nThe government of Spain ended on September 14, 1898\n\n\n\nFestival\n\n\n\nUniversity/College/Vocational School\n\n\nHigh School\n\nElementary\n\nLocal\n\n\n"}

The first one was promulgated in 1973, and the second one in 2002.\n\nThe constitution of 1973 was written shortly after Bahrain's independence from Britain in 1971. In 1972, the then ruler Shaikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa issued a decree providing for the election of a Constituent Assembly to draft and ratify a constitution. The electorate of the constituent assembly was native-born male citizens aged twenty years or older. The Constituent Assembly consisted of twenty-two elected delegates, plus the twelve members of the Council of Ministers and eight members directly appointed by Shaikh Isa.\n\nThe draft constitution provided for a unicameral legislature (the National Assembly) consisting of 44 members, 30 elected by \"universal suffrage\" (though franchise was restricted to males), plus 14 royally-appointed government ministers who were ex officio members. The constitution was enacted by decree in December 1973.\n\nThe 1973 Bahraini general election was the only election held under the 1973 Constitution, before it was abrogated by Shaikh Isa in 1975. The country was governed under emergency laws from 1975 to 2002.\n\nAfter the death of the Amir Shaikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa in 1999, his throne was taken over by his son Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. Seeking to bring an end to the 1990s uprising in Bahrain, he announced a new set of democratic reforms, including a promise to return to constitutional rule.\n\nIn 2001 Emir Hamad put forward the National Action Charter which would return the country to constitutional rule. However the opposition was opposed to the Charter's call for an amendment to the 1973 Constitution, changing the legislature from unicameral to bicameral. The Charter stated that \"the legislature will consist of two chambers, namely one that is constituted through free, direct elections whose mandate will be to enact laws, and a second one that would have people with experience and expertise who would give advice as necessary.\" The opposition groups argued this statement to be too ambiguous, and remained opposed to the Charter. Also as part of the new Constitution the country was raised in status from an Emirate to a Kingdom.\n\nEmir Hamad responded by holding a highly publicised meeting with the spiritual leaders of the Shia Islamist opposition. He signed a document clarifying that only the elected lower house of the parliament would have legislative power, while the appointed upper house would have a strictly advisory role. Upon this assurance, the main opposition groups accepted the Charter and called for a 'Yes' vote in the national referendum. The Charter was accepted in the 2001 referendum with 98.4% voting 'Yes' for it.\n\nHowever, in 2002 Emir (now King) Hamad promulgated the 2002 Constitution, without any public consultation, in which both the elected and the royally-appointed chambers of parliament were given equal legislative powers, going back on his public promise of 2001. As a result, the parliamentary elections due to be held later that year were boycotted by four political societies; Al Wefaq, a Shia Islamist group, thought to be the most popular political society in the country, National Democratic Action, the largest Leftist political society, Islamic Action Society, a marginal Shia Islamist society, and the Nationalist Democratic Rally Society, a marginal Arab Nationalist society.\n\nAccording to of the 2002 Constitution, \"executive authority is vested in the King together with the Council of Ministers and Ministers\". The Council of Ministers (Cabinet) is appointed directly by the King (Article 33d).\n\nBahrain has had only one Prime Minister since the country's independence in 1971, Khalifah ibn Sulman al-Khalifah, the uncle of the reigning King Hamad ibn Isa al-Khalifah. As of 2010, roughly half of the cabinet ministers have been selected from the Al Khalifa royal family, including the Minister of Defence, Minister of Interior, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Justice and Islamic Affairs.\n\nAccording to of the 2002 Constitution, \"legislative authority is vested in the King and the National Assembly.\n\nThe National Assembly is bicameral with the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, having 40 members elected in single-seat constituencies by universal suffrage for a four-year term. The upper house, the Shura Council, has 40 members appointed by the King of Bahrain. Among the members of the current Shura Council are representatives of Bahrain's Jewish and Christian communities as well as several women legislators.\n\nThe speaker of the National Assembly is from the appointed Shura Council.\n\nAll legislations must be passed by a majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Shura Council, and must be ratified by the King.\n\nPolitical parties are illegal in Bahrain, de facto political parties operate and are known as 'political societies'\n\nThe Judiciary of Bahrain is divided into two branches: the Civil Law Courts and the Shari'a Law Courts. The Civil Law Courts deal with all commercial, civil, and criminal cases, as well disputes related to the personal status of non-Muslims. The Shari’a Law Courts have jurisdiction over all issues related to the personal status of Muslims.\n\nJudges of the middle and lower courts are nominated by the Ministry of Justice and appointed by decree by the prime minister. The Supreme Judicial Council, chaired by the King, appoints the members of the Constitutional Court.\n\nMany of the high-ranking judges in Bahrain are either members of the ruling family or non-Bahrainis (mainly Egyptians) with 2-year renewable contracts. To secure renewal of these contracts, judges may be prone to consider it necessary to take decisions not unfavourable to the wishes or interests of the Government.\n\nBahrain is divided into four governorates for administrative purposes:\n\nEach governorate has an appointed governor and an elected municipal council.\n\n\n"}

A seasonally ice-bound species, it is found in the Arctic and Subarctic regions of the North Pacific Ocean, notably in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. It is distinguished by its striking coloration, with two wide white strips and two white circles against dark brown or black fur.\n\nIt is the only living species in the genus Histriophoca, although a possible fossil species, \"H. alekseevi\", has been described from the Miocene of Moldova.\n\nAdult seals are recognizable by their black skin, which carries four white markings: a strip around the neck, one around the tail and a circular marking on each body side, which encloses the front fins. The contrast is particularly strong with the males, while with females the difference in color between bright and dark portions is often less conspicuous. Newborn ribbon seal pups have white natal fur. After moulting their natal fur, their color changes to blue-grey on their backs and silvery beneath. Over the course of three years, portions of the fur become darker and others brighter after every molt, and only at the age of four years does the striped pattern emerge.\n\nThe ribbon seal has a short snout with broad, deep internal nares and large, rounded, front-facing orbits. Like other phocids it possess enlarged auditory bullae and lacks a sagittal crest. The ribbon seal has curved, widely spaced dentition and smaller canines than other species of phocid.\n\nThe ribbon seal has a large inflatable air sac that is connected to the trachea and extends on the right side over the ribs. It is larger in males than in females, and it is thought that it is used to produce underwater vocalizations, perhaps for attracting a mate. Unlike other pinnipeds, the ribbon seal lack lobes in its lungs that divide the lungs into smaller compartments. The ribbon seal can grow about long, weighing in both sexes.\n\nThe main predators of ribbon seals include Great white sharks and Killer whales.\n\nMale ribbon seals are typically larger than females. This is particularly recognizable in their skull morphology because male nares openings are much larger than female nares openings. Larger males are hypothesized to have a better chance of reproducing with multiple females. They have a higher fitness level and win in competition with other males over females.\n\nThe ribbon seal lives in the Arctic parts of the Pacific Ocean. During winter and spring, it hauls out on pack ice to breed, molt, and give birth. During this time, it is found at the ice front in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas. During the summer and autumn, the ribbon seal lives in open water, though some move north as the ice recedes with warmer temperatures. Little is known about its habit during this time, as it is so far from land and human observation. The ribbon seal almost never comes to land.\n\nThus far, there have been three acknowledged instances where ribbon seals have been found as far south as Squamish, British Columbia, Long Beach, Washington and even further south at Morro Bay, California. There was nothing to suggest that illness was the cause of the seals appearance, as they appeared to be healthy.\n\nRibbon seals are rarely seen out on the ice and snow. Their method of movement on the ice is unusual and highly specialized. While quickly undulating their body in serpentine motion, they grip into the ice with their claws and use alternating flipper strokes to pull themselves across the ice's surface. It has been observed that this form of locomotion is rendered ineffective on other surfaces, most likely due to the increased friction between the animal's fur and the substrate.\n\nWhile out on the ice, ribbon seals are noticeably indifferent to their surroundings. Humans in boats have been able to closely approach these seals before disturbing them. Mothers have been observed leaving pups by themselves for extended lengths of time. This would suggest that they experience little predation from land predators such as bears or humans, relative to other seals. When these seals are captured in nets, they are known to engage in feigning death behavior.\n\nThe diet of ribbon seal consists almost exclusively of pelagic creatures: fish like pollocks, eelpouts, the Arctic cod and cephalopods such as squid and octopus; young seals eat crustaceans as well. The ribbon seal dives to depths of up to 200 m in search of food; it is solitary and forms no herds.\n\nRibbon seals located in the Bering Sea consume pollock, eelpout, and arctic cod. Adult seals have relatively weak and smooth canines because their food does not need to be viciously torn.\n\nRibbon seals have a polygynous mating system, where males mate with multiple females. Ribbon seals mate and give birth on pack ice rookeries, sea ice that is not connected to land. Males use vocalizations to defend breeding territories or to attract mates. Males become sexually mature at three to six years old, females become sexually mature between two and five years old. Breeding occurs once annually, and takes place usually in late May to June, corresponding to the loss of sea ice in spring.\n\nAfter mating, the embryo does not implant directly after fertilization, instead it has delayed implantation for approximately two to four months. Delayed implantation allows the female to give birth when sea ice extent is greatest. Pregnant females have a gestation of approximately ten to eleven months, and give birth to one pup. Females care for their pup on pack ice for approximately four to six weeks. The milk females provide their pup is high in proteins and lipids, which allows the pup to grow very quickly. While lactating, a female ribbon seal will not forage for food, but must rely on fat stores in her body. After weaning the pup the female will teach the pup how to dive to forage for prey.\n\nSeal pups are born with a white lanugo (fur coat) that is shed about a month after birth. These pups do not enter the water until their lanugo is completely gone because their layer of blubber, and protection from cold ocean temperatures, remains undeveloped until shedding. Young ribbon seals were over hunted because of their soft and dense fur coat, which caused the population to decline.\n\nYoung ribbon seals look like young harp seals, and like these, they were hunted for their fur. Since they do not form herds, ribbon seals were more difficult to catch than harp seals. Since the Soviet Union limited the hunt on ribbon seals in 1969, their population has recovered. The current population is around 250,000.\n\nIn March 2008 the US government agreed to study Alaska's ribbon seal population and considered adding it to the endangered species list. However, in December 2008, the US government decided that sea ice critical to the seals' survival will not be endangered by global warming, and declined to list the species. Instead, it became a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern. The US Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), has some concerns regarding status and threats of some species, for which insufficient information is available to list them under the US Endangered Species Act.\n\nIn the summer of 2009 the Center for Biological Diversity filed suit to get the decision changed. On July 10, 2013, after again reviewing the status of this species, the National Marine Fisheries Service found that listing under the ESA was not warranted.\n\n"}

It is currently owned and maintained by the New London Maritime Society as part of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act program.\n\nRace Rock Light was built 1871–78 and designed by Francis Hopkinson Smith (1838–1915). It is an excellent example of 19th-century engineering and design. The massive masonry foundations on the reef took seven years to complete, but the stone structure, the keeper's quarters, and the tower were built in only nine months once the foundation was secure. The lighthouse has a fourth-order Fresnel lens in a tower standing above the waterline. The United States Coast Guard automated the light in 1978.\n\nThe lighthouse is believed by some to be haunted. It was featured on an episode of \"Ghost Hunters\" and seen in the show's opening credits.\n\nRace Rock Lighthouse stands in Long Island Sound, from New London, Connecticut, at the mouth of the Race where the waters of the Sound rush both ways with great velocity and force. By 1837, eight vessels had been lost in 8 years on Race Point reef.\n\nIn 1838, Congress appropriated $3,000 for a lighthouse at Race Rock but the money was never expended. In 1852, the Lighthouse Board reported: \"Various efforts have been made, and numerous appropriations expended, in endeavoring to place an efficient and permanent mark on this point. Buoys cannot be kept on it, and spindles have hitherto only remained until the breaking up of the ice in the spring.\" \n\nConstruction of the riprap foundation began in April 1871. In all, 10,000 tons of granite were used in the foundation. The Board reported in 1872 that the building costs were so high that \"no more than the landing and the enrockment of the foundation, and two courses of the pier\" could be paid for. Congress appropriated a further $75,000 in 1873, and the lighthouse was completed at a total cost of $278,716.\n\nThe ledge on which the lighthouse is built is under water and ¾ mile from Race Point Reef. It was made approximately level with small broken stone and riprap. Upon this was placed a circular-stepped mass of concrete, thick, built in four concentric layers. To form the layers of concrete, cylindrical bands of half-inch iron were used. The upper surface of the concrete is above mean low water and carries a conical pier that is high, in diameter at the base, and crowned by a projecting coping in diameter. The pier is made of heavy masonry backed with concrete and contains cisterns and cellars.\n\nThe pier is surmounted by a 1½ story granite dwelling, and the granite light tower ascends from its front. The whole structure is surrounded and protected by riprap. The tower is square at the base and octagonal at the top; it carries a fourth-order alternating electric light, standing above sea level and above land, and visible at sea. \n\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 as Race Rock Light Station. In June 2011, the General Services Administration made the Race Rock Light available at no cost to public organizations willing to preserve them as part of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act program. The New London Maritime society took ownership of Race Rock and two other lighthouses that mark the approach to New London, Connecticut.\n"}

It is the flag carrier and largest airline of Venezuela, operating services to domestic destinations and to destinations in the Caribbean and South America.\n\nIn January 1997, Venezuela's former flag carrier, Viasa, ceased operations after 37 years of service due to prolonged financial problems. In May 2001, the idea to create a new flag carrier for Venezuela was proposed, but in December 2002, the project was put on hold until 1 October 2003. On 30 March 2004, then President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, signed a decree that formally established the airline. This decree was published in the nation's official gazette the next day.\n\nOn 28 November 2004, Conviasa's inaugural flight was made with a De Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft flying from the airport in Charallave to the Santiago Mariño International Airport, on Margarita Island. On 10 December 2004, Conviasa formally began its national and international operations. Conviasa was originally run by the now defunct Ministry of Production and Commerce (\"Ministerio de la Producción y el Comercio\"), but it has since been taken over by the Ministry of Infrastructure.\n\nOn 17 April 2006, José David Cabello Rondon replaced Wilmer Castro Sotelo as head of Conviasa. On 30 June 2006, Jose David Cabello Rondon replaced Ramon Alonzo Carrizalez Rengifo as the Minister of Infrastructure and on 18 July 2006, Franklin Fernandez Martinez became president of Conviasa.\n\nFollowing the Flight 2350 crash, on September 17, 2010, the government of Venezuela grounded all Conviasa flights so that it could perform a technical review of the airline's fleet. The airline said that the temporary suspension would remain in effect until October 1, 2010. Flights were then re-instated.\n\nDecree No. 7838 of the Official Gazette No. 39,558 published on Wednesday, provides for the appointment of Colonel citizen (AVB) Jesús Rafael Viñas García, President of the Venezuelan Consortium Trading Company Aircraft Industries and Air Services SA (CONVIASA) under the Ministry of Popular Power for Transportation and Communications.\n\nOn 3 April 2012, Conviasa has been banned from flying to countries in the European Union because of safety concerns. It said that Conviasa failed to show it had taken adequate steps to prevent future accidents, but had this restriction lifted on 10 July 2013.\n\nConviasa is under the authority of the Ministry of Aquatic and Air Transport. The airline is owned by the Venezuelan government (80%) and the regional government of Nueva Esparta (20%). Conviasa has its headquarters on the grounds of Simón Bolívar International Airport in Maiquetía, Venezuela, near Caracas. Originally Conviasa had its headquarters on Margarita Island. At one time Conviasa had its headquarters in the East Tower of Parque Central in Caracas.\n\nIn August 2016, it has been reported that over 80 percent of Conviasa pilots quit their jobs due to low and outstanding payments and the airline had to reduce operations down to around 16 flights per day subsequently. Additionally, several of the company's aircraft have been stored unused since several months.\n\nOn 5 May 2017, Conviasa was forced to suspend all international operations due to a lack of foreign currency to pay for international aircraft insurance. Also in May 2017, Wamos Air terminated its contract with Conviasa on short notice. Wamos Air operated a single Boeing 747-400 for Conviasa between Caracas and Madrid. At autumn 2019 Conviasa started again many early terminated international routes back for the Conviasas network.\n\nOn 7 February 2020 the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") added Conviasa and its fleet of 40 aircraft to the Specially Designated Nationals (\"SDN\") list. In practice this makes it extremely unlikely that Conviasa will be able to source replacement parts for its fleet of airworthy and grounded B737 aircraft. Additionally, US Nationals are prohibited from flying on Conviasa's domestic and international flights. Finally, to the extent that other countries abide by OFAC policy, those countries (Brazil, France, UK) will refuse to sell Conviasa replacement parts for Embraer and Airbus aircraft, prohibit its nationals from flying Conviasa, and will cancel Conviasa-serviced routes to their respective countries (Panama, Mexico, Bolivia, and Ecuador).\n\n, Conviasa serves the following scheduled destinations:\n\nThe Conviasa fleet includes the following aircraft :\n\n\n\n"}

In the series, Appa is the only known living sky flat-tailed flying bison , a species of animals that can fly naturally, and is the animal spirit guide of the protagonist, Aang. Dee Bradley Baker voices Appa, along with all the other animals, in both the TV series and the film.\n\nThe show's creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko have described Appa's appearance as a cross between a buffalo and a manatee, although its body plan does resemble that of a water bear. According to an interview with the artists involved with creating the show, Appa's design was based on that of Catbus from the movie \"My Neighbor Totoro\", as they found it difficult to create a six-legged mammal.\n\nIn the \"Avatar\" franchise, Appa is the last known living sky bison, which are large mammal-like creatures that fly through airbending and steer through air currents with their broad tails. The bison are covered in thick white fur with a large brown arrow marking that is remarked to be extremely itchy. In the show, the markings on the flying bison's backs are what inspired the tattoos which symbolize an Air Nomad's mastery of . Their fur is shed at the end of winter. The Air Nomads summon the sky bison to their side through the use of whistles that only the animals can hear. Aang and friends use the words \"yip yip\" to get Appa to take off into the air.\n\nLike all animals in the Avatar series, Appa cannot speak.\n\nThroughout the series, Appa has demonstrated high intelligence and often appears to understand a portion of human speech, whereas , the winged lemur, struggles to understand. Although placid, Appa has shown himself capable of fighting when necessary.\n\nOther aspects of Appa's character include his fear of fire and his trusting of those who have been kind to him. He can become quite temperamental towards anyone who he thinks is a threat to himself or his friends, especially Aang. Conversely, he has demonstrated an unrestrained affection towards those that he likes. Appa also has a fear of going underground or in small tunnels, evidenced by his claustrophobic panic in the episode \"The Cave of Two Lovers\".\n\nHe has a special friendship with Momo the lemur, with whom he is often in company. Appa also shows a special preference towards Zuko, who saved him from his imprisonment beneath Lake Laogai.\n\nAppa is featured prominently throughout the franchise, not only in the \"\" TV series, but also in the film \"The Last Airbender\", various video games, and manga. Dee Bradley Baker voices Appa in both the TV series and the film.\n\nAppa is in almost every episode of the animated series, having appeared in 58 of the 61 episodes of the three seasons. Much of the back-story about the character comes from the episode \"Appa's Lost Days\", \"in which the most under-explored member of the team gets his very own episode.\"\n\nThe first meeting between Aang and Appa is seen during a flashback sequence in \"Appa's Lost Days\".\nIt is tradition with Air Nomads that each young is given a sky bison calf once they come of age to be the Airbender's lifelong animal companion. In a flashback on Appa's Lost Days, Appa's herd flies down to an Air Nomad Temple where Aang and other young Airbenders are waiting. Aang brings Appa an apple as a sign of friendship, which Appa accepts, sealing their bond as well as giving Appa his name, after the word \"apple\". Almost immediately, the two became friends and would remain close, Appa being the one thing aside from his staff and robes from Aang's home that Aang took with him when he fled the Southern Air Temple.\n\nAppa remained in suspended animation along with Aang for 100 years until their discovery by and Sokka.\nSince then, Appa has been the group's main form of transportation in their quest, as well as occasionally assisting in battle. Appa was a consistent part of the group throughout the series until his capture by the Sandbenders in \"\".\n\nAppa became lost for a short time when the group was traveling in the Earth Kingdom. He was kidnapped by Sandbenders in the middle of the vast Si Wong desert, while Aang, Katara, Sokka, and their winged lemur Momo were trapped in a vast underground library. It is later revealed that he was eventually sold to a Fire Nation circus where an animal tamer attempted to make him part of the show.\nAppa later escaped and journeyed throughout the Earth Kingdom until he encountered the Kyoshi Island Warriors, who attempted to heal the various wounds he had sustained in his travels and escort him back to Aang.\nAppa was forced to leave after an attack by Azula and her allies, ushered away by Suki while the warriors tried to delay the three Fire Nation girls.\nOn his journey he encountered a sadhu named Guru Pathik at the Eastern Air Temple, to which he had fled.\nBeing healed of his personal turmoil and directed to Aang by the sadhu, Appa flew to Ba Sing Se, where he was captured by Long Feng.\n\nAppa was kept in a secret location at Lake Laogai until his rescue by Zuko, who was initially planning on utilizing him to capture the Avatar. Appa eventually returns to the main group in the last scenes of Lake Laogai.\nAppa still accompanies Aang and his group even after they enter the Fire Nation. However, in order to make sure that he does not give away Aang's identity when flying, Aang covers Appa with clouds as a disguise while in flight.\n\nAt the Western Air Temple, he was among the first members of the group to accept Zuko as Aang's firebending teacher, as he is still grateful for Zuko freeing him in Ba Sing Se. He flew Aang and Zuko to the Sun Warrior Temple in order to learn the origin of firebending.\nHe also flew Zuko and Katara to the Southern Raiders ship, so Katara could confront the murderer of her mother.\n\nAfter the search for Aang in the \"finale\" failed, the group was forced to divide their efforts to prevent the Fire Nation from wiping out the Earth Kingdom. Appa flew Zuko and Katara to the Fire Nation capital where they fought and defeated Azula before she could assume leadership of the throne. Afterward, Appa is last seen outside of Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se, listening to Iroh play a horn.\n\nAppa appears in the 2010 live action film \"The Last Airbender\" with roar effects provided by Dee Bradley Baker. Appa's role in the film has been noted to be significantly less prominent than in the animated series.\n\nThe sky bison was rendered entirely in computer graphics for the film by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), with Pablo Helman as visual-effects supervisor. Regarding the challenges of adapting the cartoon Appa into a realistic-looking CGI beast, Helman said:\n\nILM animators also looked at polar bears while imagining the two front legs moving as arms while Appa walked.\n\nThe first video game Appa appeared in is the 2006 \"\". Appa also appears in \"\" and in \"\". In the \"Avatar: The Last Airbender Plug It In & Play TV Game\", Appa takes center stage in \"Appa Air Attack\" in which Appa destroys Fire Nation airships using his airbending abilities.\n\nAppa has been featured in varying pieces of merchandise, including toys and plush dolls. The sky bison has also been featured as a McDonald's Happy Meal toy—with Appa as a launcher that shoots out Momo, the flying lemur.\n\"KidsTelly.com\"'s Dan G. Hughes noted that \"the flying six legged bison has a lovingly sketched personality,\" further commenting how every character (including Appa) changes and grows throughout the series. Kevin Fitzpatrick of \"UGO Entertainment\" praised Appa's \"love and courage throughout the series\" citing how \"our cuddly 8-foot tall buddy [is] willing to face any danger, and overcome any hardship to return to his master.\"\n\nLeading up to the opening of \"The Last Airbender\", reporter Kofi Outlaw of \"Screen Rant\" remarked that Appa \"is a fan-favorite of the series.\" Similarly, Edward Douglas noted in \"Superhero Hype!\" that \"Two of the characters from the cartoon fans are most anxious to see brought to life aren't even human. They are Appa, Aang's six-legged flying bison, and Momo, his flying pet lemur.\" The film trailer shown during Super Bowl led \"UGO Entertainment\" critic Jordan Hoffman to ask, \"Where's Appa?\" as the sole complaint, noting the character's lack of prominence in the preview. Correspondingly, MTV's Rick Marshall provided instructions online on \"how to find the elusive Appa\" for the character's brief appearance in the background of a trailer scene.\n\nAs with the rest of the film, Appa's appearance in \"The Last Airbender\" was met with largely negative reviews. \"Geekosystem\"'s Susana Polo found the CGI version of Appa \"really quite creepy,\" noting \"that prey animals (like bison) have eyes on the sides of their heads, and so moving them to the front without changing rest of the facial structure tips us right into the Uncanny Valley.\" With regards to the film's scripting, \"io9\" reviewer Meredith Woerner wrote, \"The saddest cut by far was watching Appa and Momo's personalities disappear.\"\n"}

The film is based on Vito Russo's 1981 book \"The Celluloid Closet: Homosexuality in the Movies\", and on lecture and film clip presentations he gave in 1972–1982. Russo had researched the history of how motion pictures, especially Hollywood films, had portrayed gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender characters.\n\nThe film was given a limited release in select theatres, including the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, in April 1996, and then shown on cable channel HBO as part of its series \"America Undercover\".\n\nThe documentary interviews various men and women connected to the Hollywood industry to comment on various film clips and their own personal experiences with the treatment of LGBT characters in film. From the sissy characters, to the censorship of the Hollywood Production Code, the coded gay characters and cruel stereotypes to the changes made in the early 1990s. \n\nVito Russo wanted his book to be transformed into a documentary film and helped out on the project until he died in 1990. Some critics of the documentary noted that it was less political than the book and ended on a more positive note. However, Russo had wanted the documentary to be entertaining and to reflect the positive changes that had occurred up to 1990.\n\nRusso approached Epstein about making a film version of \"The Celluloid Closet\" and even wrote a proposal for the film version in 1986. But it was not until Russo died in 1990 that Epstein and Friedman gained any traction on the project. After his death, Channel 4 in England approached the filmmakers about the film, and offered development funding in order to write a treatment, “and most importantly to determine if it would even be possible to obtain the film clips from studios.”\n\nAfter developing the project for years, fundraising remained the biggest obstacle. Lily Tomlin, the actress and comedian who would narrate the film, launched a direct mail fundraising campaign in Vito Russo's honor. She also headlined a benefit at the Castro Theatre, which featured Robin Williams, Harvey Fierstein, and drag star Lypsinka. Individuals such as Hollywood producer Steve Tisch, James Hormel, and Hugh Hefner offered “significant support” and the filmmakers also began to receive foundation funding from the Paul Robeson Fund, the California Council for the Humanities, and the Chicago Resource Center.\n\nEuropean television again played an important role in funding the project, when ZDF/arte signed on, but it was not until the filmmakers reached out to HBO that they were able to begin production. In May 1994, “Lily Tomlin contacted Michael Fuchs, chairman of HBO, on behalf of the project. Epstein, Friedman, Tomlin, and Rosenman flew to New York for a meeting with Fuchs and HBO Vice President Sheila Nevins. At that meeting, HBO committed to supply the remainder of the budget.”\n\nThe following people are interviewed for the documentary.\n\nIn 2001, the DVD edition of the documentary includes a crew audio commentary, a second audio commentary with the late Russo, an interview Russo gave in 1990, and some deleted interviews put together into a second documentary titled \"Rescued from the Closet\".\n\n\"The Celluloid Closet\" had precursors in Parker Tyler's 1972 book \"Screening the Sexes\" and Richard Dyer's 1977 \"Gays and Film\".\n\nThe film was released at a dramatic time in gay history, as Bill Clinton was elected president as the first major party presidential candidate to court and to promise openly to gay voters. However, the movement faced a huge public setback when \"Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell\" was passed. In response to these obstacles, the LGBT-rights movement became increasingly media focused, realizing that the images projected into the world negatively affected perceptions of homosexuality. In 1994, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation was formed as a national organization. \"The Celluloid Closet\" came out in 1996, as marches and protests against homosexual representation in film and television grew.\n\n\"Protests [were] aimed specifically at some of Hollywood's biggest and most prestigious films, including \"The Silence of the Lambs\", which features a crazed transvestite who kills and flays women, and \"JFK\", which has a scene in which gays alleged to be conspirators in the Kennedy assassination cavort in sadomasochistic fun and games\". The article quoted above features an interview with Kate Sorensen, a member of Queer Nation, an organization that helped to organize the protests: \"‘Every lesbian and bisexual character in these films is accused of being a psychotic killer ... And the girl never gets the girl. I'm tired of that.’” Gay activists across the country attacked films like these, where the homosexual character is portrayed as a disgustingly erotic killer. \n\nIt was believed that these portrayals reflected \"a perverse fear of AIDS or the rising intolerance that [had] caused an increase in hate crimes of all kinds. Still, Hollywood's treatment of gays [hadn’t] helped. With few exceptions, the homosexual characters in films are creepy misfits or campy caricatures\". The release of \"The Celluloid Closet\" further emphasized the twisted way homosexuals have been depicted throughout history. Addressing specific issues that were pertinent at the time, Russo exposes the existence of Hollywood homosexuals as well as the uncontrolled homophobia that keeps homosexuality in the closet on and off the screen.\n\n\"Russo essentially did for film what ACT UP did for AIDS awareness ... he opened up a world and a culture that had almost never been discussed before under any circumstances, exposing prejudices and hurts”. The film continued to motivate the need for positive representation of homosexuals. The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation held seminars for staff at Columbia Pictures and Carolco. In addition, Hollywood Supports, a service organization with the mission to combat AIDS phobia and homophobia in the entertainment industry, was founded.\n\nGay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) gives an award called the Vito Russo Award to openly gay or lesbian people within the Hollywood film industry who advance the cause of fighting homophobia.\n\nIn addition the film was honored with four Emmy Award nominations in 1996. It was nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Informational Programming for editing, sound recording and director of photography. It was also nominated for Outstanding Informational special. Additionally, the film received both a Peabody Award and recognition at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival by winning the Freedom of Expression award.\n\nThe following is a list of film excerpts in \"The Celluloid Closet\":\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2069980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069980", "title": "Hillsboro Inlet Light", "text": "Hillsboro Inlet Light\n\nHillsboro Inlet Lighthouse is a lighthouse located on the north side of Hillsboro Inlet, midway between Fort Lauderdale and Boca Raton, in Hillsboro Beach, Florida. The light marks the northern limit of the Florida Reef, an underwater coral formation on the lower east coast of the state.\n\nHillsboro Point was designated as hazardous for the safe navigation of ships in 1855 and federal designation was sought. A request for a lighthouse at the inlet was first made in 1884. The request was repeated yearly and rejected 17 times. In 1901, the United States Lighthouse Board persuaded Congress to authorize the construction of a lighthouse in the dark area between Jupiter Inlet Light and Fowey Rocks Light. The official order approved on February 12, 1901 called for a \"first-order light at or near Hillsboro Point...at a cost not to exceed $90,000.\" No appropriation of funds was made in 1901 and in 1902 $45,000 was appropriated. The full funding to build the lighthouse was appropriated on March 3, 1903. Initially a site on the south side of the inlet was selected, however it was not feasible, so a site on the north of the inlet was chosen. The owner of the property did not want to sell at first but after beginning condemnation proceedings, an agreement to purchase the land was reached. The 3 acre (1.2 ha) parcel was purchased for $150 from Elnathan T. Field and Mary W. Osborn of Middleton, New Jersey who had bought the land for 70 cents an acre (0.4 ha) from the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund.\n\nSoon after the light was operational unexplained reports of fires in the Everglades began to come in. The cause was the lens, when stopped in the morning at just the right position, it would focus the sunlight west towards the wetlands. A landward baffle was installed. This also shielded nearby residents from the bright light at night.\n\nLightkeepers would assist shipwrecks using three 12 to 20 horsepower gas boats. The wives of the lighthouse keepers would make sea grape jelly to trade for pickled vegetables from local farmers. Four Coast Guard signalmen were stationed at the lighthouse in World War I barracked in one of the storehouses.\n\nDuring the 1926 Miami hurricane J.B. Isler stood a 32-hour watch, keeping the light burning while fearing the lighthouse would fall. It stood but of sand was washed out from under it, according to Mary Ella Knight Voss, daughter of a prior lightkeeper. The storm also damaged the dwellings and carried away the boathouse and wharf. Isler's son George and daughter Ruth, born in the keeper's house, were the first children of record born at the Hillsboro Inlet.\n\nThe lighthouse beach patrol spotted a German U-boat in 1943, during World War II. The submarine was reportedly sunk, but no wreck has been documented. Later that year a freighter, the M.S. \"Arcura\" aroused the suspicion of a lighthouse keeper. The ship was being used as a raider and was crewed by German nationals and carrying arms. The crew were transported to Port Everglades and the \"Arcura\" became a war prize.\n\nIn 1974 the lighthouse was fully automated. One United States Coast Guardsman was assigned to remain on site to maintain the light and grounds. The assistant keepers' homes were converted to guest quarters for senior coast guard and other senior military officers. The Hillsboro Inlet Light Station was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 16, 1979. The lighthouse and buildings are little altered from their original construction in 1907.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, this inlet became an increasingly busy waterway. Hillsboro Inlet Light is considered one of the most powerful lights in the world with a beam that can be seen for .\n\nThe octagonal iron pyramidal tower was built by a Chicago steel firm for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. After the fair it purchased by the U.S. government, Russell Wheel and Foundry of Detroit, Michigan completed the metal work for the structure in 1907. It was then disassembled and moved to Hillsboro Inlet. The J.H. Gardner Construction Company of New Orleans, Louisiana cleared the land, laid the foundations and re-assembled and erected the lighthouse. The construction is held together with bolts there are no welds. Iron piping held together with 192 special cast iron joints and 80 tension rods with turnbuckles make up the structure.\n\nIt is supported by eight concrete foundations in a 40-foot (12 m) circle with a ninth at the center. It is an iron skeleton framework with a central column and a watch house. The inner column has circular stairs and space for the weights that were used to rotate the lens. It stands tall. It was lit on March 7, 1907. It is one of the oldest structures in Broward County.\n\nA description published at the time read, \"The structure is an octagonal pyramidal, iron skeleton tower with central stair cylinder; the lower third of the structure is painted white; the upper two-thirds and the lantern are painted black. There are three white one-and-one-half story light-keepers dwellings in a row, about 100 feet to the northward of the light tower and a red brick oilhouse about fifty feet to the westward of the tower. There is also a boathouse near the inlet with boatways sixty feet long.\" The paint scheme was selected for daytime visibility, the lower portion white to stand out among trees, the top black to contrast with the daytime sky. The lighthouse has a cast iron roof with a finial. The main entrance faces north and has double doors in a vestibule. There is an iron balustrade separating the lantern from the watch room. The interior is iron with wood paneling and wood floors and ceiling in the watch room. The watch room has five two over two double hung sash windows.\n\nIts second-order bivalve Fresnel lens emits a light measuring 5.5 megacandelas and is placed above sea level. Although the order authorizing the lighthouse specified a first-order light, a second-order light and rotating mechanism was contracted for from Barbier, Bernarn and Turenne of Paris, France at the cost of $7,250. The lens is in diameter and weighs . It consists of 356 individual hand ground glass panels in a brass frame. The original light was an incandescent oil vapor lamp fueled with kerosene. At 370,000 candle power it could be seen from away at sea on a clear night.\n\nThe light assembly rotated on a liquid mercury reservoir, allowing up to one rotation per 15 seconds. The mercury was contained in a doughnut-shaped base and required filtering every 10 years to remove salt that accumulated. Rotation was driven by a weight on ropes through a gear mechanism. The amount of weight determined the speed of rotation. The weight had to be hand cranked back up about each hour and a half. Several times a night fuel was carried by hand up the 175 steps.\n\nThe kerosene lamp was replaced with four 250 watt incandescent bulbs in the 1920s. At 550,00 candlepower, it was then the most powerful lighthouse on the east coast of the United States. The electrical system was upgraded in 1932 allowing the same amount of light to be generated with three bulbs instead of four. This is about the time electric utility wires were erected in the Hillsboro area. Two 1,000 watt xenon high pressure lamps were installed in 1966, bringing the light to 5.5 megacandelas, making it the third most powerful lighthouse in the world at that time. In 1977 it was the most powerful light in Florida. In the 21st century it has been claimed that the beam from the Hillsboro Inlet Light is the most powerful in the world.\n\nAutomated in 1974, the light acts both as a coastal navigational aide and as a support to local water traffic.\n\nThe G.W. Brown Construction Company of West Palm Beach, Florida was contracted in 1905 to build the support buildings on the site, for a cost \"not to exceed $21,500\". Three dwellings, an oilhouse, a storehouse, a wharf, outhouses, walks and fences were built. There were three lighthouse keepers who lived with their families in the three houses. The oilhouse stored barrels of kerosene as the primary fuel for the light.\n\nIn 1977 the complex was made up of a lighthouse, light keeper's quarters, senior officer recreation quarters, shop and garage building, timer and generator building, and a barracks building. Four of these were in use by the coast guard to operate the station.\n\nThe keeper's quarters and recreational quarters are one-story wood frame vernacular buildings on brick piers. The construction is wood and clapboard. They have gabled roofs with a cross gable. One of these three homes was demolished in 2005 with plans to rebuild it in a new location. It had been bought by the Hillsboro Club in 1936, when a third lightkeeper was no longer needed, and moved north. The building had suffered structural damage and the club planned to erect a modern building in its location.\n\nThe barracks is a building on a brick foundation with an asphalt shingle roof. It was originally used as an administration building then as quarters for the crew until 1974. The garage building is . It is a wood frame single story structure with a redwood shingle roof. First used as a stable by the beach patrol it later housed a government vehicle, when assigned. Both were built in 1907. The timer and generator building was built in 1942 and is .\n\nIn 1992 the big light was turned off, due to the failure of the rotating mechanism, and a smaller temporary light (a Vega 25 rotating beacon) was installed on the railing. This light was only visible for . The Coast Guard had planned to remove the original fresnel lens but a successful local campaign, including resolutions from the cities of Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach and Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, led to the restoration. The Hillsboro Lighthouse Preservation Society was founded by Harry Cushing in 1997 as a part of the campaign. About 200 people joined the preservation society at that time. The historical value of keeping the lens in the lighthouse and the importance of the bright light as an aid to navigation were cited in the effort to persuade the Coast Guard to restore the light. The cost of the restoration was $143,000.\n\nThe old mechanism contained of mercury which was replaced by a specially designed ball bearing system. The mercury was removed in 1995 by Chemical Waste Management of Pompano Beach at a cost of $32,500. The lead based paint sandblasted off and epoxy paint applied by Worth Contracting of Jacksonsville, Florida the same year. The cost of this cleanup was $98,000. The large light was relit on January 28, 1999.\n\nOne month after the lamp was relit the bearing system, designed by Collins Engineering of Chicago, failed. It was redesigned by the Coast Guard Civil Engineering Unit, with sixty 2 inch (51 mm) balls in of oil. The redesigned mechanism was built by the Torrington Company of South Carolina and cost the Coast Guard $30,000. Once again on August 18, 2000 the light was turned on. the fresnel lens was one of nine in active use in the United States.\n\nOn June 13, 2003, the Hillsboro Inlet Light was commemorated with a 37¢ U.S. postage stamp. An art show in 2004 at the Pompano Beach civic center featured works \"inspired by the lighthouse, its station keeper's dwellings, monuments, beach and flora\". The Hillsboro Lighthouse Preservation Society (the preservation society) took over maintenance from the Coast Guard in 2008. The Coast Guard considered turning the light off or obscuring a portion of it to prevent guiding hatchling sea turtles away from the ocean in 2012. Also that year a bronze statue of the Barefoot mailman, James \"Ed\" Hamilton, was erected at the base of the lighthouse. It replaced a concrete and marble one created in 1973. The earlier sculpture stood outside the Barefoot Mailman Restaurant until it closed, moving to in front of the Hillsboro Inlet town hall and then in 2003 to the lighthouse grounds. The new bronze cost about $30,000. Both sculptures were the work of Frank Varga.\n\nOn August 9, 2014 a national historic marker commemorating the Hillsboro Inlet Light Station, commissioned by the Daughters of the American Revolution was dedicated in the Hillsboro Inlet Park across the inlet from the lighthouse.\n\nSurrounded by water on three sides and on the other by the Hillsboro Club which restricts access to its property, the lighthouse is only available to tours four times a year conducted by the preservation society via boat. In some U.S. government drug operations the lighthouse served as a vantage point. It is known locally as the \"Big Diamond\". Ralph Krugler the official historian of the preservation society is preparing a book on the history of the lighthouse. He intends to correct many of the inaccuracies that have been reported (he states even the list of keepers in bronze on the lighthouse isn't accurate) and relate stories uncovered in his research. The lighthouse is threatened by coastal erosion. Hurricane Irma washed a large amount of sand from under the foundations of the lighthouse and displaced the barefoot mailman statue. Half of the land the lighthouse sits on was washed away. Irma damaged the building and the site. The footings and foundation were fractured. The preservation society is raising funds for a plan to build a granite spur jetty to protect the site.\n\nThe first keeper, appointed March 3, 1907, was Alfred A. Berghell. His title was Captain of the United States Lighthouse Service. Bergell's work exceeded the expectations of a keeper, he rescued many stranded seafarers and saved numerous lives. The first assistant keepers were Henry A. Keys (First Assistant) and Robert H. Thompson (Second Assistant). In 1911 Thomas Knight became lightkeeper. His four children grew up at the station and were educated at a school there. At the time there were no established roads along the beach and it was a day-long trip to reach the nearest town, Pompano Beach about away. Knight's monthly salary was $125, the First Assistant B.F. Stone was paid $115 and the Second Assistant J.B. Isler $110. A local story is that Knight would signal his brother Eugene Knight, a rum-runner when the coast was clear.\n\n\n"}

The object of the game is to travel stealthily around each building while avoiding guards, retrieve several objects within a time limit, and move to the roof where a blimp is expecting the player with the loot. In this fashion the plot and gameplay resemble the older Atari 2600 title \"Keystone Kapers\", but with added features that are similar to the ones in \"Lock 'n' Chase\". Two players can play cooperatively at the same time, as the screen is always split in two.\n\nThe places the brothers burgle include a bank, a millionaire's mansion, a casino, a mint, an art gallery and a treasury. While similar in graphics and gameplay, the story and the Bonanza Bros.' role changes from the original Japanese to the early western versions: in the former, the duo are thieves attempting to steal valuable treasures for profit whilst avoiding getting arrested; in the latter, they are recruited by the Police Chief of Badville to test security facilities and help the police recover evidence from various crooked businesses and institutions, but on the threat of jail if they fail to do so.\n\nThe player can walk, jump, shoot and move behind a column or large furniture, which allows both hiding and dodging shots from the guards, which can't be neutralized definitively, only stunned for a few seconds using the gun or pressing a door against them. They are alerted by sounds or with the Brothers entering their field of vision, and then either hide, call for help or fire against the player. Some guards have a riot shield and can only be hit when moving away. A player loses a life if hit by a guard's projectile or melee attack, attacked by a dog, or pressed by a door. Losing a life in these ways causes the player to drop all items. Running out of time both costs players a life and forces them to restart the stage.\n\nThe arcade game was ported to the Sega Mega Drive, Master System, TurboGrafx-CD (Japan only), ZX Spectrum (Europe only), Amstrad CPC (Europe only), Commodore 64, Amiga, Sharp X68000 (Japan only) and Atari ST, with minor graphics differences, depending on the system, and some changes in the gameplay, mainly in the bonus stages.\n\nIt was included in the Japanese version of \"Sonic Gems Collection\" (it was removed in the Western release). It has also seen a Sega Ages release on the PlayStation 2, and that version was included in the English compilation \"Sega Classics Collection\". The game appeared as part of the \"Sega Genesis Collection\" for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The game next appeared in \"Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection\" for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Then the game is also playable in Sega Genesis Classics for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and for PC\n\nThere are also 3 spin-offs to the game. The first is called \"\"\"\" which was released in the year 1992, the second called \"\"\"\", which was released in the year 1994. These two arcade games were ported to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Saturn, and later packaged with the Sega Ages release of \"Bonanza Bros\". on the PlayStation 2. They are considered spin-offs as they do not follow the action genre of the original game, as they are instead puzzle games. A third arcade game \"\"\"\" was released in 1995 by Sega and ported to the Sega Saturn in Japan by CRI.\n\n\"Bonanza Bros.\" was also included in Sonic Gems Collection but only for the Japanese Market. It was removed from the US and PAL releases along with the \"Streets of Rage\" series in order to preserve its universal rating. However, \"Bonanza Bros.\" made its first appearance on the recent \"Sega Genesis Collection\" for the PS2 in North America as the PS2 version of Sonic Gems Collection remains in Japan and Europe.\n\nOn January 29, 2007, the Mega Drive/Genesis version of \"Bonanza Bros\". became available for download on the Wii Virtual Console in America. It was later released in Europe on February 2, 2007. It was also released for cell phones using SoftBank Mobile.\n\nRobo and Mobo later appeared as playable characters in \"Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing\" and made a cameo in the \"Race of AGES\" track in \"Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed\".\n\nA \"\"Bonanza Bros\".\" slot machine has been released by Aristocrat Leisure.\n\n"}

The name has sometimes been used for the genus \"Phoebetria\" as well, but these are usually called sooty albatrosses. They are restricted to the Southern Hemisphere, where they are the most common of the albatrosses. They were long considered to be in the same genus as the great albatrosses, \"Diomedea\", but a study of their mitochondrial DNA showed that they are a monophyletic taxon related to the sooty albatrosses, and they were placed in their own genus.\n\nThe word \"mollymawk\", which dates to the late 17th century, comes from the Dutch \"mallemok\", which means \"mal\" – foolish and \"mok\" – gull. Another etymology suggests that it comes from the German Mallemugge, a term used originally for midges or flies that whirled about lights.\n\nMollymawks are a type of albatross that belong to the family Diomedeidae of the order Procellariiformes, along with shearwaters, fulmars, storm-petrels, and diving-petrels. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns, although the nostrils are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. The fossil species \"Thalassarche thyridata\" known from a skull fragment from the Late Miocene of Victoria, Australia shows that the genus had already diverged from the sooty albatrosses 10 mya.\n\n\nMollymawks have the largest range in size of all the albatross genera, as their wingspans are . Mollymawks have what has been described as gull-like plumage, with dark black backs, mantle and tails and lighter heads, underwings and bellies. The heads of several species are often slightly darker grey, or have dark around the eyes. They all have a colourful pinkish flesh stripe from their gape to their ear that is shown during displays. They have distinctive bill structure and colouring which makes for easier identifying than other albatrosses. The bills of mollymawks are either brightly coloured orange or yellow, or dark with several bright yellow lines.\n\n\n"}

It is part of the Electrostar family, which are the most common EMUs introduced since the privatisation of British Rail. The units were ordered by Connex South Eastern, introduced in 2004/2005 by South Eastern Trains originally to replace Class 465 and Class 466 to be transferred to the Outer Suburban services to Kent to replace the Class 423 slam-door trains.\n\nIt is a derivative of the Class 375 Electrostar specially designed for use on the high-volume metro routes running from Central London, and through Southeast London in the United Kingdom. The changes are mostly focused on increasing the trains’ capacity and decreasing station dwell times. The Class 376’s doors are wider to allow more passengers to board at once, and are metro-style sliding pocket doors which are faster and more reliable than the Class 375s plug doors, although they do not close flush with the bodyside and hence are less aerodynamic and do not provide as much thermal insulation. The units have 2 sets of double doors per side in each carriage. Also, these trains do not have air conditioning, with hopper style windows available for ventilation. In order to provide more standing room, the trains also have fewer seats, more handrails, and no on-board toilets (South Eastern promised to provide additional facilities in their stations to compensate) and, as a consequence, these trains are limited to in-service journey times of 1 hour.\n\nClass 376 units have five coaches, and unlike the Class 375, they have full-width cabs instead of gangways at the ends of the train; as a result, it is not possible to walk between two coupled Class 376 units. The cab front is also smooth and ‘step free’ to reduce the dangerous problem of ‘train surfing’ in Southeast London.\n\nLike all new trains in the United Kingdom using third rail power, one carriage in each unit has a recess in its roof where a pantograph can be fitted, so as to allow for future conversion to overhead AC traction power and/or make the unit dual voltage.\n\nThe Class 376s operate on the high-density routes in South East London and Kent with their main roles being London to Dartford and London to Orpington\n\nAll Class 376 trains were allocated to Slade Green depot, but due to the high volume of work there, these trains are sent to Ramsgate for routine maintenance.\n\nIn 2017, 376 001 was named \"Alan Doggett\" after a railway employee.\n\nA train formed by units 376 002 and 376 035 was one of eleven trains that stalled and became stranded in the Lewisham area on 2 March 2018.

The school is named after the Torrey pine tree that grows in the area. Torrey Pines High School is a member of the San Dieguito Union High School District and serves the communities of Rancho Santa Fe, Del Mar, Fairbanks Ranch, Solana Beach, and Carmel Valley in San Diego County. Students from Encinitas may attend as well.\n\nTorrey Pines is one of five high schools in its district, the others being San Dieguito Academy, La Costa Canyon High School, Sunset High School and Canyon Crest Academy.\n\nThe school is a three-time National Blue Ribbon School and a California Distinguished School. In 2005, Torrey Pines was ranked as one of the 100 Best High Schools in the nation by Newsweek magazine. In 2012, Torrey Pines appeared as 110th and in 2011, as 90th. In 2015, Torrey Pines was ranked 336th. In 2016, Torrey Pines was ranked #284 nationally and #43 in California. Torrey Pines offers 26 Advanced Placement courses and had a 2012–2013 API score of 895. That same year, Torrey Pines seniors scored an average of 1860 on the SAT I, with 41 and 31 of them being recognized as National Merit Scholarship Semifinalists and Finalists respectively.\n\nIn December 2006, Torrey Pines received the Claes Nobel School of Distinction Award from the National Society of High School Scholars (NSHSS)\n\nIn 2007, Torrey Pines had students designated AP scholars by the College Board. Torrey Pines is well known for its numerous AP advanced students. In the 2013–14 school year, 72% of seniors took at least one AP exam at their time at high school, with 5.1 being the average of exams taken per test taker. 84% of AP exams taken were passed.\n\nPrior to 1936, students in all of coastal North County went to high school in Oceanside, California, as the areas of Carmel Valley and Torrey Hills were not developed for several decades.\n\nIn 1936, the San Dieguito Union High School District was created and San Dieguito High School in Encinitas opened to serve students living in Del Mar, Solana Beach, Rancho Santa Fe, and Encinitas. It remained the only high school in the district until Torrey Pines High School opened in 1974.\n\nBased on population growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and projections, a second high school was needed. At the time, San Dieguito High School and Earl Warren Middle School were forced to do double sessions to deal with the shortage of space. Earl Warren at the time also had the ninth grade freshman class attending its school.\n\nIn the early 1970s after two defeats, a bond issue placed on the ballot finally passed. A location was chosen at what seemed out-of-the-way at the time; however, the location was based on the projected growth of what was then known as “North City West” – commonly known today as Carmel Valley.\n\nTorrey Pines High School opened in the fall of 1974. The architecture reflects the era with stained/painted wood and the avocado greens, yellow, and orange decor popular in the era 1970s. When it initially opened, access to the school came from the original alignment of the two-lanes only Black Mountain Rd., but the access road was later modified when Del Mar Heights Rd. was extended east.\n\nThe architecture of the school was considered modern at the time. Design features included an open courtyard and wide hallways with large carpeted podium-like benches one could sit on. The classrooms had no windows, and many did not have doors. It also had its own Black Box Theater. The large library (the Media Center) was considered state-of-the-art at the time. In 2016, construction began on the Media Center to build a new exterior and entrance. Construction was completed December 2016.\n\nThere were many logistical problems in its initial opening, including an immediate shortage of classrooms and lockers, and lack of a food service building and a football stadium. As a result, portable classrooms and a bank of vending machines were used. Football games were played at San Dieguito High School. The school rid of all lockers in the 1990s.\n\nIn the 1980s, the school expanded. Various changes include the Media Center building's expansion towards Del Mar Heights Rd., the addition of a parking/transportation area, the repurposing of portable classrooms into athletics and weight rooms, the addition of a football stadium, and the conversion of the original black box theater into a lecture hall (with a second black box theater, a converted machine shop, later added in the Arts building). In 2003, Building E and G were built. Stairs were added to the main building. In the summer of 2008, more stairs were constructed leading from the parking lot nearest Del Mar Heights Road to the English building.\n\nIn November 2012, Prop AA, a $449 million bond initiative aimed at improving the public school district, was passed by tax payers. Since then, ongoing construction is taking place to include a performing arts center (the PAC), culinary arts center, revamping the student/front entry way, building more science and technology based classrooms, building a weight room, and moving classrooms in temporary buildings into permanent structures.\n\nTorrey Pine's chief rival is Canyon Crest Academy, located about three miles (5 km) to the east.\n\nTorrey Pines High School has a primarily Caucasian and Asian student body. Students from the districts of Del Mar, Solana Beach and Rancho Santa Fe school districts, with the exception of the area north of Escondido Creek in the Rancho Santa Fe School are eligible to attend.\n\nThe student body is largely reflective of the surrounding area of Torrey Pines, characterized mainly by a level of affluence. Most adults in the area are highly educated, and a strong majority have a bachelor's and master's degree. The median household income is over $100,000\n\nIn the 2013–14 school year, there were 2,740 students (60% White, 27% Asian, 11% Hispanic, 1% Black, <2% Other) attending Torrey Pines High School. 48% of the population was female.\n\nTorrey Pines High School's academic teams include Speech and Debate, Academic Team, Quizbowl, FRC robotics, and Science Olympiad.\nIn the 2009–10 school year, Torrey Pines High School placed 7th at the Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence National Quizbowl tournament and 7th at the HSNCT Nationals tournament. Torrey Pines regularly places in the top 5 for Science Olympiad (#3 in 2019/2018/2015, #4 in 2017/2016, and #2 in 2015). The Speech and Debate team regularly qualifies individuals to the state level competitions.\n\nPrograms include Football, Wrestling, Basketball, Men's and Women's Volleyball, Softball, Cross Country, Cheerleading, Men's and Women's Tennis, Track & Field, Soccer, Golf, Gymnastics, Baseball, Lacrosse, Swimming, Surfing, Badminton and Water Polo. On October 11, 2007, Torrey Pines football was featured in a nationally televised game on ESPNU.\n\nTorrey Pines has been named \"State School of the Year\" for overall sports excellence by Cal-Hi Sports in the 2002–03, 2014–15 and 2015–16 school years.\n\nAs of 2015, badminton is the newest team sport available at the school. In 2019 the girls volleyball team won CIF State Championship vs Kentfield, CA. The team is ranked #1 in the United States according to multiple media polls, including USA Today and MaxPreps.com!\n\nThe school has over 140 clubs. Many other non-school sponsored clubs are also available for students to join, from arts clubs such as Torrey Pines Players and National Art Honor Society, to science clubs like Torrey Pines FIRST Robotics and Drone Club, to community service organizations like American Red Cross and Amnesty International and Key Club.\n\nTPHS Model United Nations was ranked by BestDelegate in the top 150 MUN teams in the nation and the top 30 in the West for both the 2013–14 and 2017–18 school year. Each year, the teams attends 5 to 6 conferences across the state of California.\n\nThe music program has expanded to include an orchestra, a wind ensemble, guitar class, choir, and a jazz band. Various groups have consistently received high ranks at local and regional festivals such as SCSBOA each year since 2008.\n\nRecently with cuts to the music program, the symphonic band was combined with wind ensemble, and a new choir section and guitar class were opened. Choir has gone on to receive top awards at the Music in the Parks.\n\nThe speech and debate team participates in events including Congressional debate, Lincoln-Douglas debate, Public Forum debate, speech events, and Parliamentary debate. In 2005, Public Forum debaters competed in the final round of the nationally ranked Tournament of Champions. In 2013, the team qualified multiple people to the Tournament of Champions. In 2015, the team qualified three students to the Tournament of Champions, five students to NSDA nationals, and eleven students to the CHSSA state tournament. In 2016, the team qualified one student to the Tournament of Champions and numerous to the CHSSA tournament. The following year the team again qualified to the Tournament of Champions and CHSSA tournament. In both 2017 and 2018 one Lincoln-Douglas debater qualified for the Tournament of Champions. In 2019 one Congressional debater competed at NSDA nationals.\n\nThe \"Falconer\" is the monthly school newspaper. It placed first in the 1984 JEA/National Scholastic Press Association (NSPA) Spring National High School Journalism Convention in San Diego and again in March 1999 at the Spring National High School Journalism Convention in Phoenix. It placed first once again at the 2009 JEA/NSPA Convention and received a Pacemaker Award at the 2010 convention in Kansas City, Missouri. It also placed first at both the spring 2012 JEA/NSPA Convention in Seattle and the spring 2014 JEA/NSPA Convention in San Diego.

{"id": "2070060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070060", "title": "La Prensa (Managua)", "text": "La Prensa (Managua)\n\nLa Prensa is a Nicaraguan newspaper, with offices in the capital Managua. Its current daily circulation is placed at 42,000.\n\n\"La Prensa\" was founded by Pedro Belli, Gavry Rivas and Enrique Belli on March 2, 1926. In 1930, Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Zelaya became editor-in-chief, and in 1932 he bought the paper with the intention of promoting the principles of the Conservative Party of Nicaragua, as well as publicising historical studies of Nicaragua. In 1931 the office building that housed La Prensa was destroyed, for the first time out of many, in an earthquake that hit Managua. \"La Prensa\" suffered its first censorship in 1934 under the orders of Juan Bautista Sacasa, for being overly critical of the government. This began a long history of censorship under many different governments.\n\n1936 began another series of censorship by Anastasio Somoza Garcia, who came into power through a coup d'état. Threats against \"La Prensa\" for their anti-Somocista stance became customary. However, it was not until 1945, under the guise of national security, that \"La Prensa\" was ordered to completely shut down for an indefinite amount of time.\n\nIn 1952, after the death of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro, Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, his eldest son, became the new editor of \"La Prensa\", and is credited with the improvement of \"La Prensa\"'s fortunes. Chamorro Cardenal also increased the anti-Somoza rhetoric of his editorials, placing \"La Prensa\" under graver threat by the Somoza Regime. Somoza subsequently increased his pressure on the editors of \"La Prensa\". On May 22, 1953, one of Somoza's cronies, General Andrès Murillo, sent Somocista mobs to assault La Prensa's new building in Managua. Pedro was arrested, sent to military court, imprisoned and allegedly tortured for several months before his release.\nIn 1956, Luis Somoza Debayle succeeded his father, Anastasio Somoza Garcia after his assassination, and ascended to power in Nicaragua. Like his father, Debayle had little tolerance for the heavy criticism against his regime deriving from \"La Prensa\", which claimed to have argued for responsible government, participatory democracy, and neoliberal economic policies. That year, \"La Prensa\" was once again occupied by Somoza's forces, Pedro was charged with aiding the conspirators who killed Debayle's father. He was subsequently jailed and forced to publish condolences to the former Somoza. \"La Prensa\" was henceforth subjected to prolonged censorship by the regime.\n\nIn 1959, Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal went to Havana, Cuba, to meet with the new revolutionary leader, Fidel Castro, in order to bargain a deal for arms and munitions. After prolonged negotiations, disagreements between the two figures assured that no deal was created. However, by May of that year, Pedro had gathered enough capital and weapons to land 120 men, including himself, in the provinces of Boaco and Chontales, in an attempt to overthrow Luis Somoza Debayle. The invasion, the so-called \"Guerrilla de Olama y Mollejones\", failed, and Pedro was captured and sentenced to several years in prison.\n\nIn 1963, \"La Prensa\" was praised for launching a literacy campaign, a concept that was later adopted by the Marxist–Leninist FSLN. With modest tools \"La Prensa\" caused a nationwide sensation by publishing over 100,000 primers that were the backbone of the National Literacy Campaign. They circulated maps of Nicaragua to millions who had never had the opportunity the study one in school. The program was distributed by UNESCO to local \"teachers\". Notably, future Sandinistas such as Ernesto Cardenal, Sergio Ramirez, Gioconda Belli Murillo, and Carlos Mejía Godoy all contributed to the campaign. However, that year Somoza ordered the dissolution of the Patriotic Literacy Campaign's National Committee.\n\nDecember 23, 1972 saw the destruction of \"La Prensa\" due to a massive earthquake that leveled most of Managua. \"La Prensa\" was then rebuilt on the \"North Highway\" and reopened in March 1973.\n\nThe next years saw an increase of pressure by the people of Nicaragua against Somoza. \"La Prensa\" continued to be a voice of opposition even as several radio talk shows and media outlets were being shut down by the government. In August 1978, \"La Prensa\" even loaned 50,000 Cordobas to a Sandinista operation, which was never repaid.\n\nOn January 10, 1978, Pedro was blocked by a green Toyota on his way to work in the morning. He was shot by several rounds from a shotgun and died in an ambulance on the way to a nearby hospital. It is widely believed in Nicaragua that Somoza's son, \"El Chigüin\", was behind the murder. Chamorro became a martyr, and his death helped ignite widespread opposition to the Somoza government. Many of the middle and upper classes supported the Sandinista insurgency after his murder. His assassination sparked off the beginning of the final mass insurrection against Somoza.\n\nAs Somoza made his exit from Nicaragua, he ordered a final destruction of \"La Prensa\" by his Guardsmen, who used kerosene to light \"La Prensa\" ablaze. \"La Prensa\" was rebuilt within months.\n\nAfter the fall of the government, Chamorro's widow, Violeta, served on the five-member Junta of National Reconstruction. However, Chamorro and the middle-class supporters of the revolution had a different vision for the country than the Sandinistas. When it became apparent that these differences could not be resolved, Violeta Chamorro resigned from the junta in 1980 and began to oppose the Sandinistas.\n\nAt this point there was a split in \"La Prensa\". The editor Xavier Chamorro Cardenal, together with 80% of the staff, left the paper to form \"El Nuevo Diario\". This was a more pro-Sandinista paper.\n\nSoon after the passing of new laws, freedom of the press once again became answerable to many political criteria. On July 22, 1979 the Law of National Emergency would allow all media in Nicaragua to be placed under government control. On September 10, 1980, decrees 511 and 512 established prior censorship for matters of national security.\n\nIn this period the US, with the support of the newspaper, also started its campaign against the Sandinista government with support to the Contras. In this struggle under the Sandinistas, La Prensa was also often accused of being puppets of the CIA They were accused of being Contra sympathizers and thus, \"vende-patrias\" (‘motherland-sellers’) or traitors to the motherland. The paper admitted to receiving funds from the National Endowment for Democracy, a bipartisan, Congressionally financed agency created to take over financing of groups that in the past received covert aid from the C.I.A. However, it claimed that this funding was publicly declared and legal.\n\nOn March 15, 1982, the government declared a State of Emergency which closed down all independent broadcast new programs. Sandinista censorship began clamping down on political dissent and criticism. That same year \"La Prensa\" was occupied three times by Sandinista forces, and it was constantly surrounded by Sandinista mobs. Under the FSLN this pattern of hostility continued throughout the years of Sandinista rule. During the 1980s, La Prensa received extensive subventions from the United States National Endowment for Democracy.\n\n\"La Prensa\"'s strident criticism of Sandinista policies, particularly its economic policies, and its attacks on FSLN leader Daniel Ortega allegedly led the Sandinistas to adopt various restrictions on press freedom. \"La Prensa\" editors claimed that they were harassed by state security and that it was sometimes censored or closed, although it had a significantly higher circulation than the Sandinista \"Barricade\" (70 thousand copies against 45 in 1986). The restrictions were lifted in a deal between Ortega and his opponents in the run-up to the 1990 election.\n\nIn April 2018 \"La Prensa\" began criticizing the Ortega government and following a series of articles about human rights violations in October and November of that year, the government imposed a blockade of paper, ink, and other printing supplies. News media \"Confidencial\" and \"100% Noticias\" were looted and confiscated, journalists Miguel Mora and [[Lucía Pineda Ubau] were arrested, and the work of 68 exiled reporters was disrupted. Negotiations in March 2019 led to a promise to lift the blockade in October 2019, but the government did not keep its promise. The blockade was lifted in February 2020, although the newspaper must still pay off its debts before receiving the material it needs in order to operate.\n\n\"La Prensa \"generally supports [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics and is largely aligned with the United States government. It is generally conservative on social issues, and identifies closely with the Catholic Church (its cancellation of a weekly column written by Church theologians sparked a minor controversy). However, the paper has attacked ex-President and PLC Leader [[Arnoldo Alemán]] for corruption, opposed the political agreement between Alemán and Daniel Ortega, and challenged the perceived weak government of conservative President [[Enrique Bolaños]]. It has also challenged the outspoken comments of the current U.S. ambassador Paul Trivelli regarding Nicaraguan affairs.\n\n\n[[Category:Daily newspapers published in Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Spanish-language newspapers]]\n[[Category:Mass media in Managua]]\n[[Category:Nicaraguan Revolution]]"}

{"id": "2070074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070074", "title": "Busch Stadium", "text": "Busch Stadium\n\nBusch Stadium, also referred to informally as \"New Busch Stadium\" or \"Busch Stadium III\", is a baseball park located in St. Louis, Missouri, the home of the St. Louis Cardinals, the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. The stadium has a seating capacity of 44,494, and contains 3,706 club seats and 61 luxury suites. It replaced Busch Memorial Stadium (aka Busch Stadium II) and occupies a portion of that stadium's former footprint. A commercial area, dubbed Ballpark Village, was built adjacent to the stadium over the remainder of the former stadium's footprint.\n\nThe stadium opened on April 4, 2006 with an exhibition between the minor league Memphis Redbirds and Springfield Cardinals, both affiliates of the St. Louis Cardinals, which Springfield won 5-3 with right-hander Mike Parisi recording the first win. The first official major league game occurred on April 10, 2006 as the Cardinals defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 6–4 behind an Albert Pujols home run and winning pitcher Mark Mulder.\n\nThe highest attendance for a sports event other than baseball was on May 23, 2013, when 48,263 people watched Chelsea Football Club and Manchester City Football Club play a friendly match. To date, the largest attendance for a baseball game occurred Mothers Day May 12th, 2019 with an attendance of 48,556 in a game between the Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nIn 2004, then Anheuser-Busch president August Busch IV announced the brewing-giant purchased the 20-year naming rights for the stadium. Team owner William Dewitt, Jr., said: \"From the day we began planning for the new ballpark, we wanted to keep the name ‘Busch Stadium.' August Busch IV and Anheuser-Busch share our vision for continuing that tradition for our great fans and the entire St. Louis community.\" \n\nThe stadium is the third stadium in St. Louis to carry the name Busch Stadium. Sportsman's Park was renamed Busch Stadium in 1953. Team owner August Busch Jr. had planned to name it Budweiser Stadium, but league rules prohibited naming a venue after an alcoholic beverage. Busch named the stadium after himself and later created Busch Beer. The first Busch Stadium closed in 1966 and both the baseball Cardinals, and the National Football League (NFL)'s team of the same name (now the Arizona Cardinals) moved to a new multi-purpose stadium, named Busch Memorial Stadium.\n\nIn 1995, St. Louis Cardinals team ownership began to lobby for a new ballpark in downtown St. Louis, but the team was unable to acquire funding for the project for several years. In June 2001, the Missouri state government signed a contract with the team, proposing a ballpark in downtown St. Louis, but a subsequent funding bill was struck down in May 2002, leaving the saga open. Team owners sought a location near Madison, Illinois, adjacent to Gateway International Raceway, until the city of St. Louis drafted a financing plan for the team to construct the new stadium in downtown St. Louis. The stadium was financed through private bonds, bank loans, a long-term loan from St. Louis County, and money from the team owners. The development, including the Ballpark Village was projected to cost approximately $665 million with the stadium alone costing $365 million.\n\nNew Busch Stadium was designed by Populous (then known as HOK Sport) and built by Hunt Construction with an estimated cost of $344.8 million, which proved too low by $20.2 million to its final cost of $365 million. Populous' senior project designer for Busch Stadium was Jim Chibnall, who was also the lead designer of Progressive Field in Cleveland, Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Sydney Olympic Stadium and other notable stadiums throughout the world.\n\nThe field level (16,880 seats), terrace level (9,150), and bleachers (3,661) were completed in time for opening day, with total capacity on that day of 37,962, not including up to 2,751 standing room tickets. An integrated LED video and scoring system from Daktronics was installed in the stadium prior to its opening, featuring a video display measuring high by wide and three message displays, as well as more than of digital ribbon board technology.\n\nConstruction on the seating area was completed in late May increasing the capacity for the May 29, 2006 game vs the Houston Astros with finishing touches performed throughout the year. Including all 2,886 standing-room-only tickets for the general public and the suites and party rooms, the stadium's total capacity is 46,861. Natural grass turf was installed in March 2006.\nIn the stadium's debut season every Cardinal game was sold out, giving a total attendance of 3,407,104 for the season, the second-largest in team history, but since surpassed in both 2007, 2008, and 2014-2017.\n\nIn the first season of the new stadium, the Cardinals hosted the San Diego Padres in Games 3 and 4 of the National League Division Series. On October 7, in the first postseason game at the new Busch Stadium, San Diego defeated St. Louis 3-1. The Cardinals won the next night by the score of 6-2, clinching the series win. In the 2006 National League Championship Series the Cardinals hosted the New York Mets in Games 3, 4, and 5. St. Louis won Game 3 and Game 5, and eventually clinched their 17th National League pennant by defeating the Mets on the road in Game 7, 3-1. \n\nThe Cardinals faced the Detroit Tigers in the 2006 World Series. This was the third meeting between the two ballclubs in the Fall Classic, and the first in 38 years. The Cardinals won the first in 1934, and the Tigers won the second in 1968; each went the full seven games. Because the American League won that year's All-Star Game, the Tigers were granted home field advantage, meaning the Cardinals would host Games 3, 4, and 5. This proved fortuitous for St. Louis, as they won every game at home, clinching their 10th World Series championship in Game 5 on October 27, by the score of 4-2.\n\nBusch Stadium hosted only one postseason game in 2009, a 5–1 loss versus the Los Angeles Dodgers on October 10, to complete a sweep of the Cardinals.\nIn 2011, Busch Stadium hosted two postseason games in the National League Division Series versus the Philadelphia Phillies. On October 4, the Phillies won 3–2, to take a 2–1 game lead over the Cardinals. The next night, the 5th, the Cardinals beat the Phillies 5–3 to tie the series at 2 games apiece. In the NLCS versus the Milwaukee Brewers, the Cardinals won 2 of the three games they played at home (Games 3, 4, 5). The Cards ended up winning the series on the road in Milwaukee to advance to the World Series. (This was the second time the Cardinals had defeated the Brewers in a postseason series, the first being the 1982 World Series, when Milwaukee was represented as an American League team; the Brewers switched over to the National League in 1998.)\n\nBecause the National League had won the 2011 MLB All-Star Game, home field advantage went to the Cardinals as the National League champions, thus allowing the team to host the Texas Rangers for Games 1, 2, 6 and 7. Game 1 was won by the Cardinals on October 19, along with Game 6 on October 27, in a game won in walk-off fashion by a David Freese home run, then the deciding Game 7, which was taken by the Cardinals in a 6-2 final, giving the team the 2011 World Series title.\n\nBusch Stadium hosted two postseason games vs. the Washington Nationals in the 2012 National League Division Series. The two teams split the two games at Busch, before the Cardinals won two of the next three games at Nationals Park. The Cardinals then won the first two home games against the San Francisco Giants to take a 3–1 series lead, but lost Game 5 and went on to lose the series in Game 7 at AT&T Park.\n\nThe Cardinals hosted nine postseason games at Busch Stadium in 2013. In the National League Division Series, they won Games 1 and 5 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, with the latter game capping off a series comeback after trailing 2–1. They would win every home game of the NLCS against the Dodgers, including a 9–0 shutout win in Game 6 to take the series 4–2. In the World Series, the Cardinals hosted Games 3–5 against the Boston Red Sox. Game 3 on October 26 ended in an obstruction call when Allen Craig was impeded by Will Middlebrooks at third base, thus awarding him a run after umpire Jim Joyce ruled obstruction on the play. The next night Game 4 ended on a successful pickoff by Koji Uehara on pinch-runner Kolten Wong at first base. The Cardinals led 2–1 after the controversial Game 3 win, but proceeded to lose the next three games to lose the series 4–2.\n\nThe Cardinals played two games in Busch Stadium against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series. The first two games of the Series were played at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, and the teams each won a game there. The Series then moved to Busch Stadium, and the Cardinals won the next two games, to win the Series 3-1 and advance to the National League Championship Series.\n\nThe Cardinals opened the National League Championship Series at Busch Stadium on October 11, 2014, against the San Francisco Giants. The teams split games 1 and 2 played at Busch Stadium, and the Series moved to AT&T Park in San Francisco. The Giants won games 3, 4, and 5 in their home ballpark, to defeat the Cardinals in the NLCS 4-1, and move on to an appearance in the 2014 World Series against the Kansas City Royals.\n\nThe Cardinals hosted two postseason games at Busch Stadium in 2015. In the National League Division Series, they won game 1 on October 9, 2015, but lost game 2 against the Chicago Cubs. The Cardinals then lost games 3 and 4 to the Cubs at Wrigley Field to lose the series 3-1.\n\nThe stadium hosted the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game on July 14, 2009. The American League defeated the National League in that game, 4-3. Tampa Bay Rays outfielder Carl Crawford won MVP. President Barack Obama threw out the ceremonial first pitch wearing a Chicago White Sox jacket.\n\nMissouri has recently started to play one game a year at Busch. In 2009, they defeated SLU, and in 2010, they defeated Illinois in a Braggin' Rights matchup.\n\nThe Cardinals have allowed local high school teams to play each other on the field following select weekend afternoon games. So far, only 3 homeruns have been hit by high school students. The first was on May 7, 2011 by Johnny Wilson of Marquette Catholic High School against Farmington High School. The second was on April 21, 2018 by Zach Hilboldt of De Smet Jesuit High school against Palmyra High School. The third was on April 11, 2018 by David Olejnik (St. Louis Home School Patriots) against (Marshall County High School, Benton, Kentucky).\n\nOn August 19th, 2019, Paul DeJong hit his 22nd Home run which shattered the \"M\" on the Big Mac Land sign. The \"M\" was taken out for repairs and the rest of the season (including the playoffs) now says \"Big _ac Land\".\n\nBusch Stadium hosted an exhibition soccer game on May 23, 2013, between English clubs Manchester City and Chelsea. Tickets for the match sold out within 20 minutes of going on sale, and Manchester City won 4-3 in front of a crowd of 48,263, to date the largest attendance at a sporting event at the stadium.\n\nLater that year on November 18, Busch hosted a friendly between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Argentina; before a crowd of more than 30,000, many of which were members of St. Louis' large Bosniak community, Argentina beat Bosnia 2-0, with Sergio Agüero scoring both goals.\n\nOn April 4, 2015, the United States Women's National Soccer Team defeated New Zealand 4-0 in front of over 35,000 fans.\n\nOn November 13, 2015, the United States Men's National Soccer Team defeated St. Vincent and the Grenadines 6-1 in the first match of the fourth round of qualifiers for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in front of a crowd of 43,433.\n\nAnother international friendly was hosted at Busch in 2016: Italian side A.S. Roma, bolstered by a goal from Bosnian star Edin Džeko, defeated Liverpool F.C. 2-1.\n\nThe United States women's national team returned on May 16, 2019, for another friendly against New Zealand as part of their preparations for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. The United States won 5–0 in front of 35,761 spectators.\nOn March 9, 2016, the National Hockey League announced that the St. Louis Blues, for the first time in their 50-year history, would host an outdoor game. The 2017 NHL Winter Classic was held at Busch Stadium on January 2, 2017. The Blues won the game by a score of 4–1 against the Chicago Blackhawks. Despite thick fog and spotty rain, Busch Stadium sold out to a crowd of 46,556 St. Louis hockey fans.\n\nOn June 12, 2019, the stadium hosted a watch party for game 7 of the Stanley Cup, where the Blues beat the Boston Bruins and won their first ever Stanley Cup.\n\nSouthern Illinois University and Southeast Missouri State played each other in the first ever football game at Busch Stadium on September 21, 2013 in front of a crowd of 14,618.\n\nWhereas the previous stadium was enclosed on all sides in the \"cookie-cutter\" style very similar to Riverfront, Veterans, Three Rivers and Atlanta-Fulton County stadiums, the new stadium is similar to the many other Populous designed \"retro-classic\" fields. Like all those, it offers a panoramic view of the downtown skyline.\n\nThe Gate 3 entrance on the west side of the stadium is most iconic, with a large \"bridge\" resembling the Eads Bridge arching over the entrance. The exterior of the stadium contains historical plaques of Cardinals logos, the STL insignia and a Busch Stadium logo behind home plate.\n\nAfter complaints from fans that not all out-of-town games could be placed on the Daktronics out-of-town scoreboard at one time, following the inaugural season a number of advertisement panels were removed to expand the scoreboard and also create a secondary video board. In 2016, the entire original scoreboard and fascia-board system was replaced, creating two full HD video boards: the main board, which took up the entire area of the original scoreboard and video board, measures 4,800 sq ft (40 ft x 120 ft), with the out-of-town scoreboard measuring 3,280 sq ft (40 x 81 ft).\n\nOutside the Gate 3 entrance stands a bronze statue of Cardinals legend Stan \"The Man\" Musial. Other Cardinals statues that previously surrounded Busch Memorial Stadium are now displayed at the corner of Clark and 8th streets, outside the Cardinals' team store. The statues are of former Cardinal players and Hall of Fame inductees Enos Slaughter, Dizzy Dean, Rogers Hornsby, Red Schoendienst, Lou Brock, Bob Gibson and Ozzie Smith; former St. Louis Browns player and Hall of Fame inductee George Sisler; former Negro league St. Louis Stars player and Hall of Fame inductee Cool Papa Bell; and former Cardinals radio broadcaster and Hall of Fame honoree Jack Buck.\n\nFans at the stadium have access to a large amount of food and drink options, ranging from standard ballpark fare like bratwurst, nachos and peanuts to St Louis-area favorites such as pork steak sandwiches and toasted ravioli. Budweiser holds the beer contract for the stadium as one would expect, but local craft breweries such as Saint Louis Brewery, Urban Chestnut, and 4 Hands all are available at multiple outlets. Tickets for multiple all-inclusive areas are sold on a single game basis, with amenities running the gamut from the ritzy Champions Club (offering a multiple-course buffet, large screen televisions, a chance to get on television or radio as a broadcast booth is located inside the club, and a full bar) to the more family-oriented Scoreboard Patio (with table seating for four in center field and a cookout-style selection of food). Cardinal management also allows outside food and drink (including soft-sided drink coolers); as a result, it is not uncommon to see vendors selling discounted bags of peanuts and bottles of soda and water, or even scalpers including a box of Cracker Jack with tickets.\n\nThe ballpark features a make-your-own-mascot store featuring Fredbird, the Cardinals' team mascot.\n\nAfter \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" sportswriter Rick Hummel was honored with the J. G. Taylor Spink Award and induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007, the Cardinals renamed the stadium's press box the \"Bob Broeg-Rick Hummel Press Box\", honoring the two local writers enshrined in Cooperstown.\n\nBallpark Village is a multi-phase residential and entertainment complex located on the site of the former Busch Memorial Stadium across the street from the new ballpark. Despite several years of delays, groundbreaking occurred in February 2013 and the first phase was completed in time for Opening Day 2014.\n\nDuring a weather incident during a July 2006 game vs the Atlanta Braves, portable concession stands were knocked over, the infield rain tarp was damaged, and plastic sheets used to protect the press box were dislodged. As a result of the storm at least 30 spectators were injured, of whom five were taken to the hospital. After the storm happened, the stadium designated shelter areas for such disasters which are located throughout the ballpark.\n\nFollowing Juan Encarnación's face injury on August 31, 2007, workers extended the screen from dugout to dugout during the 2007-2008 off season.\n\n"}

Fishman was the longest-running news anchor in the history of American television before Dave Ward surpassed him in 2015. He was also a record-holding aviator. \"The Simpsons\" cartoon television anchorman Kent Brockman was partially inspired by Hal Fishman.\n\nA Brooklyn, New York native, Fishman received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University where he worked at the campus radio station. He also received a master's degree in political science from UCLA in 1956. Planning for a career in academia, he served as an assistant professor of political science at California State University, Los Angeles for two years.\n\nEventually, Los Angeles independent television station KCOP approached Fishman to teach an on-air course, and later, the station invited him to anchor his own segment. Fishman had been on the air continuously since June 20, 1960, moving from KCOP to KTLA in 1965. That year, he received significant exposure as a field reporter for KTLA when he helped cover the Watts Riots live from the Los Angeles Police Department command center. Fishman also worked at KTTV and KHJ-TV (now KCAL-TV) during the early 1970s, returning to KTLA on January 8, 1975, to anchor their evening new broadcast \"NewsWatch,\" later renamed \"News at Ten.\"\n\nAs a news anchor, Fishman covered numerous events in Los Angeles and the world, ranging from the assassination of presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, to the Sylmar and Northridge earthquakes, to Pope John Paul II's 1987 visit to southern California. He, along with KTLA, was credited for being the first to air footage of the police beating of Rodney King in 1991, an event that sparked riots a year later when the officers were acquitted. In 2000, KTLA dedicated its newsroom in Fishman's honor, commemorating his 40 years in television and his years of service and commitment to the region.\n\nFishman won myriad awards, including the Associated Press Television-Radio Association's first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award. He received a \"star\" on the Hollywood \"Walk of Fame,\" at 1560 Vine Street and KTLA named its television news studio after Fishman. He also authored two novels, \"Flight 902 Is Down\" (co-authored with aviation writer Barry J. Schiff) and \"The Vatican Target.\" Fishman was also an accomplished pilot and set 13 records for speed and altitude. In 1969, he was awarded the Louis Blériot medal by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.\n\nHal Fishman's last broadcast was on July 30, 2007, eight days before his death. On July 31, 2007, the night before Fishman became ill and after his last broadcast, KTLA celebrated his 47 years in television with a special gala at the Autry National Museum in Los Angeles. The event was emceed by \"Morning Show\" anchor Michaela Pereira and attended by such dignitaries as Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Los Angeles County sheriff Lee Baca. During the gala, Fishman spoke to the audience about his time in television. He appeared somewhat fatigued but little would be known about his condition until the day after.\n\nFishman died August 7, 2007 at home, 18 days before he would have turned 76, following recent treatment for a liver infection, which had detected cancer in his liver and colon. That morning, the station interrupted its regular news schedule and dedicated much of the \"Morning Show\" and \"Prime News\" broadcasts to Fishman. The reporters on \"Prime News\" did not break for commercials that evening.\n\nFishman played a television news anchor or reporter in numerous films during his career:\n\n"}
{"id": "2070091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070091", "title": "Battle of Campaldino", "text": "Battle of Campaldino\n\nThe Battle of Campaldino was a battle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines on 11 June 1289. Mixed bands of pro-papal Guelf forces of Florence and allies, Pistoia, Lucca, Siena, and Prato, all loosely commanded by the paid \"condottiero\" Amerigo di Narbona with his own professional following, met a Ghibelline force from Arezzo including the perhaps reluctant bishop, Guglielmino degli Ubertini, in the plain of Campaldino, which leads from Pratovecchio to Poppi, part of the Tuscan countryside along the upper Arno called the Casentino. One of the combatants on the Guelph side was Dante Alighieri, twenty-four years old at the time.\n\nLater, in the mid-14th century, Giovanni Villani recorded the long-remembered details— as Florentines remembered them— in his chronicle, though the \"casus belli\" he offers are merely conventional \"outrages\" on the part of Arezzo; the elaborately staged raid and fight led by aristocrats on both sides sounds like stylized gang warfare, though carried out, according to Villani, under the battle standard of the absent Charles, the Angevine King of Naples. The immediate cause of the battle were reports that the Guelphs were ravaging the places of Conte Guido Novello, who was podestà of Arezzo, and, worse, threatening the fortified place called Bibbiena Civitella. This led to an Aretine force being quickly assembled and marching out to counter the threat. It was reported by Villani that a plot had been intercepted at Arezzo, by which the bishop agreed to give over to the Florentines Bibbiena Civitella, and all the villages of his see, in return for a life annuity of 5,000 golden florins a year, guaranteed by the bank of the Cerchi family. The plot was uncovered by his nephew Guglielmo de' Pazzi, and they hustled the bishop onto his horse and brought him to the battlefield, where they left him dead among the slain of the battle and its aftermath: Guglielmino de' Pazzi in Valdarno and Buonconte, the son of Guido I da Montefeltro.\n\nThe Guelphs had the numerical advantage in the battle, with about 12,000 combatants. Most of these troops had been raised by Florence, and were generally well-equipped due to their hometown's wealth. Florence was well known at the time as a producer of highly regarded weapons and armour, and its troops probably had better weaponry than the Ghibellines. The Florentines were reinforced by other Tuscan Guelphs, including Bologna, Pistoia, Lucca, San Gimignano, San Miniato, Siena, Volterra, and other small towns. Furthermore, small contingents of Guelphs from Romagna and Guelph exiles from Arezzo fought at Campaldino. The Guelph cavalry lacked combat experience and suffered from indiscipline, so that the about 10,000 infantrymen formed the actual core of the Guelph army. At least half of the infantry were better-trained specialists who operated as spearmen, pavisiers, crossbowmen, and archers, while the rest consisted of less effective, but still reliable militiamen. In general, the Italian Guelph troops were less experienced than the Ghibellines. In addition to these local forces, about 400 French knights of Amerigo di Narbona's retinue fought at Campaldino; they were experienced veterans who were highly regarded for their combat prowess.\n\nThe Guelph army was officially led by Amerigo di Narbona, who served as Charles II of Naples's representative for Tuscany and had been appointed as a compromise, since the Italian Guelphs could not agree on one of their own to lead them. Though he probably possessed some combat experience and proved to be a competent commander, Amerigo's relative lack of military skill, youth, and the fact that he did not speak Tuscan Italian meant that his command of the army was mostly nominal. As a result, the \"de facto\" leader of the army was a Carcassonne knight in Amerigo's retinue, Guillaume da Durfort, a highly experienced veteran of several wars. Under these two, several Italian Guelphs served as sub-commanders, with the most notable being Corso Donati, Vieri de' Cerchi, and the Barone de Mangiadori.\n\nThe Ghibelline army was of similar size, but differed drastically in its composition from the Guelph force. Unlike their opponents, the Ghibellines relied less on \"ad hoc\" city militias and were instead mostly composed of feudal lords and their retinues, who were generally much better trained and more experienced than their opponents. The Ghibelline cavalry and infantry were thus of higher quality than their opponents, with Villani describing them as \"the flower of the Ghibellines of Tuscany, of the March, and of the Duchy, and of Romagna\" who were \"practised in weapons and in war\". The Ghibelline infantry consisted of fewer spearmen, pavisiers, and crossbowmen than its Guelph counterparts; instead, it relied on offensive close-quarters combat with swords and bucklers. Despite this, many Ghibelline fiefs were rather poor, and both their cavalry and infantry were probably less well equipped than the Guelphs.\n\nThe Ghibelline army had three main commanders: First, Guglielmo Ubertini who had served for forty years as the bishop of Arezzo by the time of the battle. \"A man of the sword as much as of the pen\", Ubertini had proven to be a capable, ruthless, and brave military commander during several conflicts before 1289, though his strategic acumen was impeded by his interest in defending the possessions of his family at any cost. This greatly influenced his decision to seek battle at Campaldino, despite having been advised against it. The second most important Ghibelline commander was Guido Novello Guidi, the Count of Poppi, a veteran of several campaigns, and long-time leader of the Ghibelline cause in Tuscany. A shrewd and opportunistic politician and military leader, he was one of the few Ghibelline commanders to survive the Battle of Campaldino. Finally, there was Buonconte di Montefeltro, an accomplished strategist and tactician who had led the Ghibellines to a \"brilliant\" victory at Pieve al Toppo in 1288. Montefeltro was one of those who argued against seeking battle at Campaldino, but nevertheless drew up a good battle-plan when forced to do so.\n\nThe Florentines deployed an advance guard of cavalry, behind which, in the centre of their line stood the bulk of their cavalry. On each wing they placed their infantry, slightly forward so the line was crescent shaped. Behind this force, they drew up their baggage and, behind that, a reserve of infantry and cavalry. The Aretines drew up in four lines; the first, second, and fourth of cavalry, the third of infantry.\n\nThe Aretines attacked with their first three lines, scattering the Florentine advanced guard and pushing back the main body towards the wagons. However, they now came under crossfire from the flanking infantry. The Florentine reserve now made a flanking attack, trapping the Aretines. According to Villani, Corso Donati, podestà of Pistoia, though under orders to stand ready in reserve, shouted “If we lose, I will die in the battle with my fellow citizens; and if we conquer, let him that will, come to us at Pistoia to exact the penalty!” and charged the Aretine flank, helping break up the lines and win the day for the Guelphs. Instead of coming to the rescue, the Aretine reserve fled. Aretine casualties were high. Ploughing the Campaldino plain used to turn up human remains and bones as recently as eighty years ago.\n\nThe Battle of Campaldino secured Guelph dominance in Florence, though internecine fighting among the Whites and Blacks among the Florentine Guelphs resulted in civic disturbances and the exile of many, including notable medieval Italian poet Dante Alighieri (a member of the Whites, the faction more opposed to papal power).\n\n"}

In 1814, this re-organisation continued and the territory was subdivided into parishes. Some examples of those were Alnwick (Neguac and Tabusintac), Saumarez (from Tracadie to Caraquet), and Beresford (from Nepisiguit to Restigouche).\n\nNames were then given to these new civil parishes honouring naval and military men (Nelson, Wellington, and Carleton, for Thomas Carleton).

It is notable for the unusual lodges that adorn each corner in a style that could be likened to miniature Greek temples.\n\nThe bridge links the A4 (London Road) in Walcot on the north side of the Avon, with the A36 in Bathwick, via Bathwick Street at the point where it is joined by St. John's Road.\n\nCleveland Bridge was built in 1826, by William Hazledine (Coalbrookdale Ironworks) with Henry Goodridge as the architect, on the site of a Roman ferry crossing. Named after the 3rd Duke of Cleveland, it spans the River Avon at Bathwick, and enabled further development of Georgian Bath to take place on the south side of the river. It was designed by architect Henry Goodridge to take the traffic of his day, horse-drawn vehicles and pedestrians, and was constructed using the warm golden Bath Stone and an elegant cast-iron arched span.\n\nA toll house was required to charge users of the bridge for the privilege of crossing. Rather than building merely one, Goodridge decided to install four — one on each corner — in order to maintain the absolute symmetry of his elegant neoclassical design. He provided each of these lodges with columns fronting onto the bridge, giving them the appearance of small ancient temples. This is what still gives the bridge its unique appearance today. Only one of the four (Number 1 next to St John's Road) was actually used as a toll house; the rest were always let to private tenants as small dwellings or shops. Given the small size of these dwellings (one room upstairs, two on the middle floor and one that would have flooded each winter in the basement) it seems extraordinary that the 1891 UK census clearly records a family of three people and two lodgers living in one of the lodges.\n\nThe bridge was constructed using funds subscribed by numerous local wealthy citizens to a specially formed Bathwick Bridge Company with a view to investors making a return on investment through the toll charges. In order to establish the bridge and the company an Act of Parliament was required and, in a move which would later prove the undoing of the company, the level of the toll was fixed at one penny. Unfortunately for the shareholders of the Bathwick Bridge Company, inflation took hold during the 19th century and, by the early 20th century, a one penny toll was not worth much. By the 1920s, the revenues from tolls no longer covered the costs of operating and maintaining the bridge.\n\nThe Bath Corporation Act of 1925 allowed the City Council to take over the bridge from the now bankrupt Bathwick Bridge Company. To much celebration, it was freed it from tolls for all traffic on 20 June 1927 and extensively restored during 1928 and 1929. Cleveland Bridge is still free to use today, although the next bridge upstream at Bathampton is one of the UK's few remaining privately owned toll bridges.\n\nAfter the Second World War, a shortage of cash and materials and a general lack of interest in Bath's architecture meant that the fabric of the bridge was neglected. By the 1980s, three out of four of the lodges were derelict and unfit for human habitation. Concerned at the neglect of this unique structure by its owners, Bath and North East Somerset Council, a group of local individuals formed a charity (the \"Bath Historical Buildings Trust\") to take a very long lease on three of the lodges and to restore them so that they could once again become homes for people. This work is almost complete.\n\nIn 2019 a survey showed some structural parts were near end of life, resulting in a temporary 18-tonne weight restriction being imposed from January 2020. It is anticipated major repair work will be carried out in 2020, subject to government funding, involving the temporary closure of the bridge.\n\nAround the same time that the bridge was freed from toll, heavier vehicles powered by the internal combustion engine were making their way onto the roads. The slender cast iron span of Cleveland Bridge required reinforcement. Four reinforced concrete trusses were inserted under the roadway around 1929, giving it the strength which today allows it to carry 38 tonne trucks. Bath has no eastern bypass, so the bridge has become a heavily used \"Euro route\" for large trucks on their way from Britain's south coast ports to the docks further north. High volumes of local traffic at peak travelling times make this a regular traffic slow spot in the mornings and evenings, carrying 17,000 vehicles a day.\n\nDespite the frequent traffic jams on Cleveland Bridge, Bath's only fire and ambulance stations are located next to it and the drivers of emergency vehicles are assertive in expressing their need to cross on the way to respond to an emergency call. The connection between the bridge and these services is long established because the lodge formerly used as a toll house (Number 1) was the 999 response centre for the city of Bath for some time after the Second World War.\n\nThe distinctive lodges of Cleveland Bridge are now restored to their former glory and are back in use as homes. One, however, remains a working premises. Sculptures by ceramic artist Peter Hayes are on display around the world but he still works from a studio below his gallery at lodge number 2. His techniques for creating a patina include immersing half-completed pieces for a period of months in the river, where they absorb minerals from the water.\n"}

It is found in New Zealand, Hawaiian Islands, Borneo, Java, New Guinea, islands of the Pacific Ocean to Australia and the Juan Fernández Islands.\n\nThe name \"Coprosma\" means \"smelling like dung\" and refers to the smell (methanethiol) given out by the crushed leaves of a few species.\n\nMany species are small shrubs with tiny evergreen leaves, but a few are small trees and have much larger leaves. The flowers have insignificant petals and are wind-pollinated, with long anthers and stigmas. Natural hybrids are common. The fruit is a non-poisonous juicy berry, most often bright orange (but can be dark red or even light blue), containing two small seeds. The orange fruit of the larger species were eaten by Māori children, and are also popular with birds. It is said that coffee can be made from the seeds, \"Coprosma\" being related to the coffee plants. A notable feature (also found in other genera of Rubiaceae) is that the leaves contain hollows in the axils of the veins; in these, and on the leaf stipules, nitrogen-fixing bacteria grow. In addition the hollows, or domatia, encourage certain kinds of mites to take up residence, which feed on and reduce parasitic fungi which attack the leaf.\n\n"}

Ticket and snack prices were kept low, partly because the theater was staffed almost entirely by volunteer teenagers and run partly on donations. The foundation ran several film-related programs for seniors, mothers and youth. It also provided direct financial and promotional support to other local nonprofit organizations.\n\nThe theater is located on Fairfield's main street, 1424 Post Road.\n\nExcept for the general manager of the premises, the staff is mostly under the age of eighteen, and the theater is a popular place for teens to earn community service hours in order to apply for college.\n\nAccording to the theater's Web site, it costs more than $20,000 a year to maintain the building, including more than $7,500 a year in maintenance costs for the 75-year-old marquee sign and $10,000-plus for the new DVD projection system's 35mm film projection equipment (replacement cost for one film projector would be $75,000). \nThe new projection system \"has enhanced the theater's capabilities\" by \"increasing the opportunities for special programs and events at the theater.\"\n\nThe foundation runs a number of programs using the theater:\n\nThe theater first began operation in 1920 as a local moviehouse. It added a second screen room in 1979. There are many stories regarding the theater's changing construction. For instance, behind one of the balconies, there used to be an office. It was accompanied with a lounge, but in 1950, the owner decided to make the office bigger, compromising the lounge. A lift would raise an organ out of the basement and onto the stage. The theater was also home to stage performances in the past but was converted into a movie theater in the 1970s.\n\nStarting in the late 1990s, the Loew's chain attempted to run it as an art house, but failed and had to close it down in the spring of 2001.\n\nLeo Redgate, a real estate investor in town who remembered seeing \"Jaws\" at the moviehouse as a kid, decided it would be good for the community to revive the place. He created the theater foundation, invested his own money to fix up the building, and rounded up volunteers, including high school students. By the end of 2001, the theater was open again.\n\nBut now the foundation faces another challenge. Repairs are desperately needed to the property, which Redgate would like to buy from the Pollack family. He has made a couple of multimillion-dollar offers, but Norman Pollack told the Fairfield Citizen-News that the seven members of the family who make up the limited liability company are not inclined to sell at this time. Redgate is not asking for anything unreasonable in wanting to buy the property. The lease even states that he can match any offer the Pollacks receive - whether now or 10 years from now - for as long as he still rents the place.\n\nAmong the goals of the foundation were to restore and operate the theater and provide affordable entertainment, unite young people in the spirit of volunteerism, and act as a catalyst for community involvement, inspiration, and support. However, Redgate failed to deliver on his promises when the foundation faced financial struggles owing more than eighty thousand dollars on the lease and over fifteen thousand to film distributors and services provided to the foundation.\n\nThe Fairfield Citizen reported that Redgate's decision in stepping away from the foundation had nothing to do with the financial struggles it was facing and two lawsuits that were filed by Buena Vista Pictures and Sony Pictures . Redgate left a lot in question when he claimed that \"there is no issue with the non-profit status\" when in fact the Internal Revenue Service revoked the non-profit status in 2010.\n\nThe theatre's final public showing was held on September 8, 2011. \n\nThe Fairfield Citizen reported that new leasing efforts were underway to find someone who would be willing to take over the Fairfield landmark. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "2070168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070168", "title": "Battle of Ilipa", "text": "Battle of Ilipa\n\nThe Battle of Ilipa () was an engagement considered by many as Scipio Africanus’s most brilliant victory in his military career during the Second Punic War in 206 BC.\n\nIt may have taken place on a plain east of Alcalá del Rio, Seville, Spain, near the village of Esquivel, the site of the Carthaginian camp.\n\nThough it may not seem to be as original as Hannibal’s tactic at Cannae, Scipio's pre-battle maneuver and his \"reverse Cannae\" formation stands as the acme of his tactical ability, in which he forever broke the Carthaginian hold in Iberia, thus denying any further land invasion into Italy and cutting off a rich base for the Barca dynasty both in silver and manpower.\n\nAfter the Battle of Baecula and Hasdrubal Barca’s departure, further Carthaginian reinforcements were landed in Iberia in early 207 BC under Hanno, who soon joined Mago Barca. Together they were raising a powerful army by the heavy recruitment of Celtiberian mercenaries. Meanwhile, Hasdrubal Gisco also advanced his army from Gades into Andalusia. Thus Scipio was facing two concentrated enemy forces, one of which would no doubt fall on his rear if he tried to attack the other.\n\nAfter careful planning, Scipio decided to send a detachment under Marcus Junius Silanus to strike Mago first. Marching with great speed, Silanus was able to achieve complete surprise when he fell on the Carthaginian camps, which resulted in the dispersion of Mago's Celtiberians and Hanno's capture.\n\nThus Hasdrubal was left alone in facing Scipio's concentrated force, but the Carthaginian general was able to avoid battle by splitting his troops among fortified cities. The Iberian campaign of 207 BC ended without any further major action.\n\nThe next spring, the Carthaginians launched their last great effort to recover their Iberian holdings. Mago was joined at Ilipa by Hasdrubal Gisco, creating a force estimated at 54,000 to 74,000, considerably larger than Scipio's army of 48,000 men, which was composed of a large number of Spanish allies who were not as seasoned as Roman legionaries. Livy's figures, however, give the Carthaginian army 50,000 infantry and 4,500 cavalry (where he mentioned other sources give the figure of 70,000, such as Polybius at 11.20, but Livy believes it was the lesser number), whilst he puts Scipio's force at 55,000 men, so it was also possible Scipio outnumbered the Carthaginians by a slight margin.\n\nUpon the arrival of the Romans, Mago unleashed a daring attack on the Roman camp with most of his cavalry, under his Numidian ally Masinissa. However, this was foreseen by Scipio, who had concealed his own cavalry behind a hill, which charged into the Carthaginian flank, and threw back the enemy with heavy losses on Mago's side.\n\nThe two opponents spent the next few days observing and testing each other, with Scipio always waiting to lead out his troops only after the Carthaginians had advanced from their camp first. The Roman formation always presented the legions in the center and Iberians on the wings, thus leading Hasdrubal and Mago to believe that this would be the Roman arrangement on the day of battle.\n\nBelieving his deception had taken a firm hold on the Carthaginian commanders, Scipio made his move. First he ordered the army to be fed and armed before daylight. He then promptly sent his cavalry and light troops (\"velites\") against the Carthaginian outposts at daybreak, while advancing with his main force behind, all the way to the front of the Carthaginian position. This day his legions stood at the wings and the Iberians in the centre.\n\nSurprised by the Romans' sudden attacks, the Carthaginians rushed to arm themselves and sallied forth without breakfast. Still believing that Scipio would arrange his force in the earlier fashion, Hasdrubal deployed his elite Africans in the centre and the Spanish mercenaries on his wings; he was not able to change formation after discovering the new Roman arrangement because the opposing army was too close, as Scipio had ordered his troops to form for battle closer to the Carthaginian camp.\n\nFor the next few hours Scipio held back his infantry behind the skirmishing light troops and thus amplified the effect of the missed breakfast on his enemy. When he finally decided to attack, the light troops were called back through the space between the \"maniples\" to position themselves behind the legions on the wings; then the main advance began. With his wings advancing at a faster pace than the Iberians in his center, Scipio formed a concave, or \"reverse Cannae\", battle line. Furthermore, the Roman general expanded his wings by ordering the light troops to the flanks of the legionaries, and the cavalry to the flank of the light troops, thus enveloping the whole Carthaginian line on both sides.\n\nStill refusing his center, Scipio's legions, light troops, and cavalry attacked the half-trained Spaniards on the Carthaginian wings from front, flank, and rear respectively. The Carthaginian center was helpless to reinforce its wings with the threat of the Iberian force that was looming large in the near distance but not yet attacking.\n\nWith the inevitable destruction of its wings, the Carthaginian center was further demoralized and confused by the trampling by their own maddened elephants, which were being driven towards the center by the Roman cavalry attacking the flanks. Combined with hunger and fatigue, the Carthaginians started to withdraw, at first in good order. But as Scipio now pressed his advantage by ordering his Iberian center into battle, the Carthaginians crumbled, and a massacre that might have rivaled the one in Cannae was only averted by a sudden downpour, which brought a hold to all actions on the field, and enabled the remaining Carthaginians to seek refuge in their camp.\n\nAlthough temporarily safe in their camp, the Carthaginians were not able to rest. Facing the inevitable Roman attack the next morning, they were obliged to strengthen their defenses. But, as more and more Spanish mercenaries deserted the Carthaginians as night drew forward, Hasdrubal tried to slip away with his remaining men in darkness.\n\nScipio immediately ordered a pursuit. Led by the cavalry, the whole Roman army was hot on Hasdrubal's tail. When the Romans finally caught up with the Carthaginian host, the butchery began. Hasdrubal was left with only 6,000 men, who then fled to a mountain top without any water supply. This remnant of the Carthaginian army surrendered a short time later, but not before Hasdrubal and Mago had made good their escape.\n\nAfter the battle, Hasdrubal Gisco departed for Africa to visit the powerful Numidian king Syphax, in whose court he was met by Scipio, who was also courting the favor of the Numidians.\n\nMago Barca fled to the Balearics, whence he would sail to Liguria and attempt an invasion of northern Italy.\n\nAfter his final subjugation of Carthaginian Iberia and revenge upon the Iberian chieftains, whose betrayal had led to the death of his father and uncle, Scipio returned to Rome. He was elected consul in 205 BC with a unanimous nomination, and with the Scipiones and their allies now in power, he would have the control of Sicily as proconsul, from where his invasion of the Carthaginian homeland would be realized.\n\n"}

{"id": "2070187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070187", "title": "History of California 1900–present", "text": "History of California 1900–present\n\n\"This article continues the history of California in the years 1900 and later. For events through 1899, see History of California before 1900.\"\n\nAfter 1900, California continued to grow rapidly and soon became an agricultural and industrial power. The economy was widely based on specialty agriculture, oil, tourism, shipping, film, and after 1940 advanced technology such as aerospace and electronics industries – along with a significant military presence. The films and stars of Hollywood helped make the state the \"center\" of worldwide attention. California became an American cultural phenomenon; the idea of the \"California Dream\" as a portion of the larger American Dream of finding a better life drew 35 million new residents from the start to the end of the 20th century (1900–2010). Silicon Valley became the world's center for computer innovation.\n\nCalifornia is now the most populous state in the United States. If it were an independent country, California would rank 34th in population in the world. California has had waves of immigration and emigration over the years. The first big wave was the California Gold Rush starting in 1848 of miners, businessmen, farmers, loggers, etc. as well as their many supporters.\n\nThere were fewer than 10,000 females in a total California population (not including Native Americans who were not counted) of about 120,000 residents in 1850. About 3.0% of the gold rush Argonauts before 1850 were female or about 3,500 female Gold Rushers, compared to about 115,000 male California Gold Rushers. Massive immigration from mostly other states continued throughout the nineteenth century. California did not reach a \"normal\" male to female ratio of about one to one until the 1950 census. California for over a century was short on females.\n\nThe 1900 census showed emigrations down to \"only\" a 20% growth rate. The early 1900s showed a massive population increase of over 60% between 1900 and 1910. The population more than doubled again in the next 20 years by 1930. Foreign immigration largely ceased during the Great Depression, as immigration to the United States was held to a low of 23,068 per year by 1933, and many foreign workers were deported. There were not enough jobs to go around. After World War II and the Great Depression, there was a rapidly increasing buildup of United States workers in California as wartime industries boomed. Most of these workers were from other states as they settled in California and increased the California population to 10,586,223 by 1950. Immigration to the United States only started to increase significantly in 1946, when immigration to all of the United States was back up to 108,721 per year The continuing prosperity and emigration from other states and immigration from other countries in the 1950s and 1970s almost doubled the California population again to 19,953,134 by 1970. The 1970–2010 population growth has still been substantial but has slowed to \"only\" about a 15% growth rate per decade. By 2010 the California population growth rate slowed slightly to 10%.\n\nEarthquakes in California are common occurrences since the state is traversed by six major strike-slip fault systems with hundreds of related faults, many of which are \"sister faults\" of the infamous San Andreas Fault that runs nearly the full length of California at the juncture of the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The fault systems include the Hayward Fault Zone, Calaveras Fault, Clayton-Marsh Creek-Greenville Fault, and the San Gregorio Fault. Significant blind thrust faults (faults with near vertical motion and no surface ruptures) are associated with portions of the Santa Cruz Mountains and the northern reaches of the Diablo Range and Mount Diablo. The California earthquake forecast gives a rough estimate of where the main earthquake zones in California are. Earthquake damage depends on what area is hit, how close to the surface the center of the earthquake is located, and its magnitude. Earthquake damage, for a given magnitude earthquake, to human structures depends on how well the buildings are built and what the structures are located on. Buildings on soft or filled-in soil suffer the most because they feel shock waves most strongly. Buildings on bedrock suffer less damage because the ground is firmer. Sometimes the ensuing fires, floods or tsunamis caused by the earthquake are often where the greatest damage occurs.\n\nThe 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck the city (then the largest in California) and nearby communities at 5:12 a.m. on Wednesday, April 18, 1906. Devastating fires broke out in the city that lasted for several days, destroying about 28,000 buildings. As a result of the quake and fires, over 3,000 people died and over 80% of San Francisco was destroyed. The death toll from the earthquake and resulting fire is the greatest loss of life from a natural disaster in California's history.\n\nThe most widely accepted estimate for the magnitude of the earthquake is a moment magnitude (M) or Richter magnitude (M) of 7.8; however, other values have been proposed, from 7.7 to as high as 8.25. Shaking was felt from Oregon to Los Angeles, and inland as far as central Nevada.\n\nThe San Francisco 1906 earthquake was caused by a rupture on the San Andreas Fault, a continental transform fault that forms part of the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The fault is characterized by mainly lateral motion where the western (Pacific) plate moves northward relative to the eastern (North American) plate. The 1906 rupture propagated both northward and southward from its epicenter for a total of about . The San Andreas Fault runs the length of California from the Salton Sea in the south to Cape Mendocino to the north, a distance of about . The earthquake ruptured the northern third of the fault for a distance of about . The maximum observed surface displacement was about ; however, geodetic measurements show displacements of up to in some places. The most recent analysis by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) shows that the most likely epicenter of the 1906 earthquake was very near Mussel Rock on the coast of Daly City, an adjacent suburb just south of San Francisco.\n\nA strong foreshock preceded the mainshock by about 20 to 25 seconds. The strong shaking of the main shock lasted about 42 seconds. The shaking intensity as described on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale reached VIII in San Francisco and up to IX in areas to the north like Santa Rosa, where destruction was devastating. There were decades of minor earthquakes – more than at any other time in the historical record for northern California – before the 1906 quake. They have been widely interpreted subsequently as precursory activity to the 1906 earthquake.\n\nDue to a widespread practice by insurers to indemnify San Francisco properties from fire, but not earthquake damage, most of the destruction in the city was blamed on the fires. Some property owners deliberately set fire to damaged properties in order to claim them on their insurance. Capt. Leonard D. Wildman of the U.S. Army Signal Corps reported that he \"was stopped by a fireman who told me that people in that neighborhood were firing their houses… they were told that they would not get their insurance on buildings damaged by the earthquake unless they were damaged by fire. The insurance industry eventually paid out over $250,000,000 (the largest amount they paid out for the next 60 years) which significantly helped to rebuild the city.\" Building standards of the original 1906 buildings had almost no earthquake resistance built in. Since 1906 earthquake standards have been steadily upgraded as damages caused by earthquakes are investigated. Unfortunately, a lot of older buildings do not meet today's standards, and it would typically cost too much to upgrade them. It was discovered in 1906 (again) that all masonry-type structures built of brick and un-reinforced concrete are resistant to fire but not earthquakes. A detailed analysis of the city of San Francisco today estimates that an earthquake over 7.0 magnitude would completely destroy or seriously damage many sections of San Francisco and could possibly result in thousands of deaths. Today in most communities, structures built to later earthquake standards would do well in all but the strongest earthquakes. The water mains and other infrastructure needed for fighting fires have all been upgraded but are yet untested.\n\nCalifornia pioneers after 1848 discovered an increasing number of oil seeps—oil seeping to the surface, especially in Humboldt, Colusa, Santa Clara, and San Mateo counties, and in the asphaltum seeps and bituminous residues in Mendocino, Marin, Contra Costa, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties. In Southern California, large seeps in Ventura, Santa Barbara, Kern, and Los Angeles counties received the most attention. Interest in oil and gas seeps was stirred in the 1850s and 1860s, becoming widespread after the 1859 commercial uses of oil were demonstrated in Pennsylvania. Kerosene quickly replaced whale oil for lighting, and lubricating oils became an essential product in the Machine Age. Other uses later in the 19th century included providing paving material for many roads and providing power for many steam locomotives and steam-powered shipping—replacing coal.\n\nOil became a major California industry in the 20th century with the discovery of new fields around Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley, and the dramatic explosion in demand for gasoline to fuel the rapidly growing number of automobiles and trucks now being produced. Most of the oil production in California began in the late 19th century. At the turn of the century, oil production in California continued to rise at a booming rate. In 1900, the state of California produced 4 million barrels. In 1903, California became the leading oil-producing state in the US, and traded the number one position back and forth with Oklahoma through 1930. Production at the various oil fields increased to about 34 million barrels per year by 1904. By 1910 production had reached 78 million barrels. California drilling operations and oil production are concentrated primarily in Kern County, the San Joaquin Valley, and the Los Angeles Basin. \nAs of 2012, California was the nation's third most prolific oil-producing state, behind only Texas and North Dakota. In the past century, California's oil industry grew to become the state's number one GDP export and one of the most profitable industries in California.\n\nThere is also some offshore oil and gas production in California, but there is now a moratorium on new offshore oil and gas leasing and drilling in California waters and a deferral of leasing in federal waters. These restrictions were imposed after a series of accidents in the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill released oil into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn 1920, oil production in California had expanded to 77 million barrels. Between 1920 and 1930, new oil fields across Southern California were being discovered with regularity, including Huntington Beach in 1920, Long Beach and Santa Fe Springs in 1921, and Dominguez in 1923. Southern California had become the hotbed for oil production in the United States.\n\nHowever, the development of increased oil production in California had consequences. The additional California oil fields, along with booming oil supplies in Texas and Oklahoma, put downward pressure on the price. In the 1930s the Texas Railroad Commission tried to take charge of allocating oil production among the states to keep prices from falling to a few pennies a barrel.\n\nAfter a century, the San Joaquin Valley remains a major producer. The Kern County part of the valley in 2008 had over 42,000 producing oil wells that provided about 68% of the oil produced in California, 10% of the entire United States production, and close to 1% of the total world oil production. Add to that another producing 2,000 wells in Fresno County. If the valley were a state in its own right, it would rank behind Texas, Alaska, and Louisiana as the fourth largest oil producer state in the country.\n\nThe San Joaquin Valley is also home to 21 giant oil fields that have produced over 100 million barrels of oil each, with four \"super giants\" that have produced over 1 billion barrels of oil. Among these \"super giants\" are Midway-Sunset, the largest oil field in the lower 49 United States, and Elk Hills, the former United States Naval Petroleum Reserve.\n\n\"For a chronology of the state's oil industry see California oil and gas industry#Chronology of the California oil industry.\"\n\nIn 2012 the state was the 13th largest producer of natural gas in the United States, with a total annual production of 248 billion cu feet of gas. Today natural gas is the second most widely used energy source in California. About 45% is now burned in gas-fired plants for electricity generation; the proportion increases as coal-burning plants are phased out and nearly all new plants are powered by natural gas. One of the main advantages of natural gas is that it only produces about 55% as much CO as coal for the same amount of electricity produced. About 9% of the natural gas is used in facilitating the extraction of more oil and gas. Another 21% is used for residential space and water heating, cooking, clothes drying, etc.; 9% is used for commercial building and water heating, and 15% is used in industrial use. California imports about 85% of its natural gas, using six large gas pipelines from Texas, New Mexico and Canada.\n\nIn 1911 a new California Assembly created a new railroad commission with vastly enlarged powers and brought public utilities under state supervision. Organized businessmen were the leaders of both of these reforms. The driving force for railroad regulation came less from an outraged public seeking lower rates than from shippers and merchants who wanted to stabilize their businesses. Public utility officers spearheaded campaigns for the passage, and later the enlargement of the Public Utilities Act. They expected that state regulation would reduce wasteful competition between their companies, improve the value of their companies' securities, and allow them to escape continual wrangling with county and municipal authorities.\n\nAlthough the businessmen were influential in obtaining the passage of bills they wanted, no group of businessmen dominated the California legislature or the railroad commission after 1910. Legislation proposed by some businessmen was opposed by other business interests. Organized labor made significant gains during the Progressive Era, but they were not a result of benevolent, middle-class reformer actions, but of powerful lobbying activity on the part of unions with their solid base in San Francisco and Oakland.\n\nIn the 1920s, most progressives came to view the business culture of the day not as a repudiation of progressive goals but as the fulfillment of it. The most important progressive victories of 1921 were the passage of administrative reorganization laws, the King Bill, increasing corporate taxes, and a progressive budget. In 1927–31, governor Clement Calhoun Young (1869–1947) brought more progressivism to the state. The state began large-scale hydroelectric power development, and began state aid to the handicapped. California became the first state to enact a modern old-age pension law. The state park system was upgraded, and California (like most states) rapidly expanded its highway program, funding it through a tax on gasoline, and creating the California Highway Patrol.\n\nCalifornia women had the right to own property in their own name since the first California Constitution in 1850. In 1911 California voters, in a special election, narrowly granted women the right to vote, nine years before the 19th Amendment enfranchised women nationally in 1920, but over 41 years later than the women of Wyoming had been granted the right to vote. Women's clubs flourished and turned a spotlight on issues such as public schools, dirt and pollution, and public health. California women were leaders in the temperance movement, moral reform, conservation, public schools, recreation, and other issues. They helped pass the 18th amendment, which established Prohibition in 1920. Initially, women did not often run for public office.\n\nCalifornia played a major role in the Progressive Movement. It was the only state where the Progressives took control of the Republican Party.\n\nCalifornia was a leader in the Progressive Movement from the 1890s into the 1920s. A coalition of reform-minded Republicans, especially in southern California, coalesced around Thomas Bard (1841–1915). Bard's election in 1899 as United States senator enabled the anti-machine Republicans to sustain a continuing opposition to the Southern Pacific Railway's political power in California. They helped nominate George C. Pardee for governor in 1902 and formed the \"Lincoln–Roosevelt League\". In 1910 Hiram W. Johnson won the campaign for governor under the slogan \"Kick the Southern Pacific out of politics.\" In 1912 Johnson became the running mate for Theodore Roosevelt on the new Bull Moose Party ticket.\n\nBy 1916 the Progressives were supporting labor unions, which helped them in ethnic enclaves in the larger cities but alienated the native-stock Protestant, middle-class voters who voted heavily against Senator Johnson and President Wilson in 1916.\n\nPolitical progressivism varied across the state. Los Angeles (population 102,000 in 1900) focused on the dangers posed by the Southern Pacific Railroad, the liquor trade, and labor unions; San Francisco (population 342,000 in 1900) was confronted with a corrupt union-backed political \"machine\" that was finally overthrown following the earthquake of 1906. Smaller cities like San Jose (which had a population of 22,000 in 1900) had somewhat different concerns, such as fruit cooperatives, urban development, rival rural economies, and Asian labor. San Diego (population 18,000 in 1900) had both the Southern Pacific and a corrupt machine.\n\nCalifornia played a major role in terms of agriculture, industry, finance and propaganda during World War I. Its industrialized agriculture exported food to the Allies, 1914–1917, and expanded again when America entered the war in 1917. After the war ended, it shipped large quantities of food to central Europe as part of national relief efforts. Hollywood was thoroughly engaged, with feature films and training films. Attractive climate conditions led to the addition of numerous Army and Navy training camps and airfields. Construction of transports and warships boosted the economy of the Bay area.\n\nOrganized labor was centered in San Francisco for much of the state's early history. By the opening decades of the twentieth century, labor efforts had expanded to Los Angeles, Long Beach and the Central Valley. In 1901, the San Francisco-based City Front Federation was reputed to be the strongest trade federation in the country. It grew out of intense organizational drives in every trade during the boom around the start of the 20th century.\n\nEmployers also organized during the building trades strike of 1900 and the (San Francisco) City Front Federation strike of 1901, which led to the founding of the Building Trades Council. The open shop question was at stake. Out of the City Front strike came the Union Labor Party, because workers were angry at the mayor for using the police to protect strikebreakers. Eugene Schmitz was elected mayor in 1902 on the party's ticket, making San Francisco the only town in the United States, for a time, to be run by labor. A combination of corruption and unscrupulous reformers culminated in graft prosecutions in 1907.\n\nIn 1910, Los Angeles was still an open shop, and employers in the north threatened for a new push to open San Francisco shops. Responding, labor sent delegations south in June 1910. National organizers were sent in during a lockout of 1,200 idled metal-trades workers. Then occurred an incident that would set back Los Angeles organizing for years: on October 10, 1910, a bomb exploded at the \"Los Angeles Times\" newspaper plant that killed 21 workers.\n\nIn the decade following, the rapid growth of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or Wobblies) in un-unionized trades, logging, wheat farming, and lumber camps began extending its efforts to mines, ports and agriculture. The IWW came to public notice after the Wheatland Hop Riot, when a sheriff's posse broke up a protest meeting and four people died. It led to the first legislation protecting field labor. The IWW was harmed by anti-union drives and prosecution of members under the California Criminal Syndicalism Act.\n\nThe IWW was also involved in the 1923 seamen's strike at San Pedro, where Upton Sinclair was arrested for reciting the Declaration of Independence. The man who became the most prominent Wobbly of all, Thomas Mooney, soon became a \"cause-celebre\" of labor and the most important political prisoner in America.\n\nThe Preparedness Day Bombing killed ten people and hurt labor for decades. During the 1920s, the open shop efforts succeeded through a coordinated strategy called the \"American Plan\". In one case, the Industrial Association of San Francisco raised over a million dollars to break the building trades strikes in 1921 that led to the collapse of the building trades unions. This employers association cut wages twice in one year, and the Metal Trades Council was defeated, losing an agreement that had been in effect since 1907. The Seamen's Union also suffered defeat in 1921.\n\nUnions grew rapidly after 1935 with political and legal support from the national New Deal and its Wagner Act of 1935. The most serious strike came in 1934 along the state's ports. In May 1934, dock workers and longshoremen along the West Coast went on strike for better hours and pay, a union hiring hall and a coast-wide contract. Communists were in control of the union, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), led by Harry Bridges (1901–1990).\n\nOn \"Bloody Thursday\", July 5, 1934, San Francisco was swept by bloody rioting. Striking maritime workers, pitting themselves against police, took control of much of the waterfront and warehouse areas of the city. Two workers were killed and hundreds were clubbed and gassed. The West Coast Waterfront Strike lasted 83 days, with longshoremen returning to work on July 31. Arbitration was agreed to, and it resulted in a victory for the strikers and the unionization of all West Coast ports in the United States.\n\nSan Francisco in the late 1930s had 120,000 union members. Longshoremen wore union buttons on their white union-made caps, Teamsters drove trucks as unionists, and fishermen, taxi drivers, streetcar conductors, motormen, newsboys, retail clerks, hotel employees, newspapermen and bootblacks all had representation. Against 30,000 trade union members in 1933–34, Los Angeles by the late thirties had 200,000, even against a severe 1938 anti-picketing ordinance. But Los Angeles became unionized in the mass production industries of aircraft, auto, rubber, and oil, and at the yards of San Pedro. Later, drives for unionization spread through musicians, teamsters, building trades, movies, actors, writers and directors.\n\nFarm labor remained unorganized, the work brutal and underpaid. In the 1930s, 200,000 farm laborers traveled the state in tune with the seasons. Unions were accused of an \"inland march\" against landowners' rights when they took up the early effort to organize farm labor. A number of valley towns endorsed anti-picketing ordinances to thwart organizing.\n\nIn the 1933–1934 period, a wave of agricultural strikes flooded the Central Valley, including the Imperial Valley lettuce strike and San Joaquin Valley cotton strike. In the 1936 Salinas lettuce strike, vigilante violence shocked the nation. Again, in the spring of 1938, about three hundred men, women and children were driven by vigilantes from their homes in Grass Valley and Nevada City.\n\nA 1938 ballot proposition against picketing, \"Proposition #1\", considered fascist by commentators for the state grange, became a huge political struggle. Proposition #1 failed at the polls. Soon, racist distinctions fell as California unions began to admit non-white members.\n\nBy the advent of World War II, California had an old-age assistance law, unemployment compensation, a 48-hour work week maximum for women, an apprentice law, and workplace safety rules.\n\n\"Okies\" were the 250,000 hard-luck migrants who fled the Dust Bowl and depression in Oklahoma and neighboring states in the 1930s in search of a better future. Many sought farm labor jobs advertised in the Central Valley. They were harshly disparaged at the time. Police were stationed at the Arizona line to keep them out, and the state legislature passed a law to keep them out, but it was overturned by the United States Supreme Court. Historian James Gregory has explored the long-term impact of the Okies on California society. Gregory finds that most came from urban backgrounds, and one in six had been a white-collar worker. He notes that in \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" novelist John Steinbeck saw the migrants becoming active agitators for unions and the New Deal, demanding higher wages and better housing conditions. Steinbeck did not foresee that most Okies would move into well-paid jobs in war industries in the 1940s. The children and grandchildren of the Okies seldom returned to Oklahoma. They did leave the farms and became concentrated in Southern California's cities and suburbs. Long-term cultural impacts include a commitment to evangelical Protestantism (especially the Pentecostals and the Southern Baptists), a love of country music, populist conservatism of the sort that boosted Reagan, and strong support for traditional moral and cultural values.\n\nIn the 1934 California gubernatorial election, novelist Upton Sinclair was the narrowly defeated Democratic nominee, running on the platform of the socialist End Poverty in California (EPIC) movement, a radical response to the Great Depression. Other radical movements flourished, such as the Townsend Plan for old age pension, and \"Ham and Eggs\", which promised \"$30 Every Thursday\" to everyone over age 50. Voters narrowly rejected it in 1938, and the utopians failed to enact any panaceas; however, the movements did spawn a generation of activists on the left.\n\nThe only way California can support its extensive population and agriculture is to store water in numerous reservoirs and use pipes, tunnels, pumps and canals to distribute it where it is needed when it is needed. Beginning before 1900, California has built extensive water projects costing many billions of dollars to store and move water where it is needed. California water comes primarily from snowfall in the Sierra Nevada in the northern part of the state during the relatively short winter from about October to March. The rest of the year typically has very little rainfall or snowfall. California weather is also prone to extended droughts that can last several years. During an average rainfall year, about 14% of the power used in California is generated by hydroelectricity.\n\nThe Los Angeles Aqueduct runs from the Owens Valley, through the Mojave Desert and its Antelope Valley, to dry Los Angeles far to the south. The aqueduct project began in 1905 when the people of Los Angeles approved a bond for the \"purchase of lands and water and the inauguration of work on the aqueduct\".\n\nOn June 12, 1907, a second bond was passed with a budget of to fund the project. Construction began in 1908 and finished in 1913 while employing 5,000 workers during that period.\n\nThe Los Angeles aqueduct as originally constructed consisted of six storage reservoirs and of conduit. Beginning north of Black Rock Springs, the aqueduct diverts the Owens River into an unlined canal to begin its journey south to the Lower San Fernando Reservoir. This reservoir was later renamed the Lower Van Norman Reservoir. Creeks flowing from the eastern Sierra are diverted into the aqueduct.\n\nThe original project consisted of of open unlined canal, of lined open canal, of covered concrete conduit, of concrete tunnels, and of steel siphons. To build it required of railroad track, two hydroelectric plants, three cement plants, of power lines, of telephone line, and of roads. It was later expanded with the construction of the Mono Extension and the Second Los Angeles Aqueduct.\n\nThe Los Angeles Aqueduct uses gravity alone to move water and to generate electricity, so it is cost-efficient to operate. Finished in 1911, the Los Angeles Aqueduct was the brain-child of the self-taught engineer William Mulholland and is still in use today.\n\nHetch Hetchy is a valley that lies in the northwestern part of Yosemite National Park and is drained by the Tuolumne River. Starting in about 1901, San Francisco started looking for a new supply of municipal water. Following the disastrous 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, this search intensified, and they finally chose the Tuolumne River as the \"best\" available water resource. The City and County of San Francisco bought most of the water rights to the Tuolumne River watershed in 1910. The Hetch Hetchy project centered on damming the main Tuolumne River as it meandered through Hetch Hetchy's wide glacial-cut valley. The river, with its source in a perpetual glacier on Mount Lyell, drains of watershed of the rugged granite mountains sloping west from the Sierra Nevada crest. The Hetch Hetchy water system's goal was providing up to of water per day to San Francisco and the growing Bay Region and tap the hydroelectric power that would be generated by a dam and power stations. After a vigorous debate, the United States Congress passed the Raker Act in 1913 which authorized the building of dam(s), hydroelectricity plant and municipal water supply system inside part of Yosemite National Park. The act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson in February 1916.\n\nA key element of the plan was a new dam and reservoir in the Hetch Hetchy Valley, but access to the area was poor, so a railroad was planned to help build the dam. The steep terrain dictated a 4-degree roadbed, roughly twice as steep as a \"regular\" railroad. The steep grades dictated geared-down locomotives. The first of the Hetch Hetchy Railroad (HHRR) were completed in 1915, and the remaining were completed by October 1917. Construction costs for the HHRR were about US$3 million, far less than what the city might have paid contractors to transport workers, concrete and other materials for the dam over the rough and steep terrain by 12 mule train wagons. The president of the railroad was San Francisco Mayor James Rolph, and the vice president and general manager was the construction project's chief engineer Michael O'Shaughnessy. The Hetch Hetchy Railroad was begun as a connection of the Sierra Railway at Hetch Hetchy Junction, west of Jamestown, and extended another to the Hetch Hetchy Dam (later named the O'Shaughnessy Dam after the chief engineer) site for delivery of construction workers and materials. The regular trains were supplemented by trucks converted to run on the tracks to carry unscheduled loads of men or supplies or evacuate ambulance patients. The railroad was dismantled and part of its road bed converted into a highway after the Michael O'Shaughnessy dam was completed, and the new Don Pedro Reservoir built in 1971 flooded part of the original track line.\n\nThe vast Hetch Hetchy Project undertaking created the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, miles of tunnels, and a aqueduct to deliver the water and power lines to deliver electricity to the Bay Area. Of the many dams, reservoirs, and power plants, three were in the high country of Tuolumne County. The main dam was built in two phases. Large pipes called penstocks channeled water down the mountain to the main Moccasin Power hydroelectric plant completed in 1925 and rebuilt in 1968.\n\nIn 1923, the O'Shaughnessy Dam was completed to its initial height on the Tuolumne River, creating the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. The dam was raised higher to its present height in 1939. The dam and reservoir are the centerpiece of the Hetch Hetchy Project, which in 1934 began to deliver water west to San Francisco and its client municipalities in the greater San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nTrinity Dam was the main storage feature of the Central Valley Project (CVP) proposal to divert water from the Trinity River in northwestern California to augment water supplies in the CVP service area. In 1948, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which was responsible for the construction and operations of most CVP facilities, devised a plan of four dams and two tunnels to capture and store some of the flow of the Trinity River and transport it to the Sacramento River, generating a net surplus of hydroelectric power along the way. Trinity Dam was the main storage feature of the division, providing a stable flow to the Lewiston Dam, the diversion point for Trinity River waters into the Central Valley via the Trinity Tunnel. Trinity Lake was completely filled with water from the Trinity River by 1963, becoming the third largest lake in California, with of shoreline.\n\nShasta Dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam across the Sacramento River in the northern part of California, at the north end of the Sacramento Valley. The dam mainly serves long-term water storage and flood control in its reservoir, Shasta Lake. The lake has of mostly steep mountainous shoreline covered with tall evergreen trees and manzanita. The lake's maximum depth is . Water released from the lake generates hydroelectric power. At high, the dam is the ninth-tallest dam in the United States and forms the largest reservoir in California.\n\nShasta Dam was envisioned as early as 1919 because of frequent floods and droughts troubling California's largest agricultural region, the Central Valley. Shasta Dam was first authorized in the 1930s as a state undertaking. However, this coincided with the Great Depression, and building of the dam was transferred to the federal Bureau of Reclamation as a public works project. Construction started in earnest in 1937 under the supervision of Chief Engineer Frank Crowe. During its building, the dam provided thousands of much-needed jobs; it was finished 26 months ahead of schedule in 1945. When completed, the dam was the second-tallest in the United States after Hoover, and was considered one of the greatest engineering feats of all time.\n\nEven before its dedication, Shasta Dam served an important role in World War II, providing electricity to California factories, and it still plays a vital part in the management of state water resources. However, it has brought about major changes to the environment and ecology of the Sacramento River, and met with controversy over its significant destruction of Native American tribal lands. In recent years, there has been debate over whether or not to raise the dam in order to allow for increased water storage and hydropower generation.\n\nPardee Dam is a structure across the Mokelumne River on the boundary between Amador and Calaveras counties, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada approximately northeast of Stockton. The Pardee Reservoir impounds of water when it is full.\n\nConstruction on the Mokelumne Aqueduct and Pardee Dam began in 1926, and by 1929 the concrete arch Pardee Dam and the First Mokelumne Aqueduct, consisting of a single pipeline, were completed. The first deliveries to the Bay Area from the reservoir were made on June 23, 1929. At the time of completion, Pardee Dam was the tallest in the world (this record was surpassed one year later by Diablo Dam in Washington). In 1949, a second pipeline was built, and in 1963 the third pipeline was constructed, bringing the aqueduct to its present capacity. In 1964, the second major dam and reservoir on the Mokelumne River, the Camanche Dam and Camanche Reservoir, were completed below Pardee. The Mokelumne Aqueduct and dam(s), run by the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD), is the primary water source for 35 communities in Alameda and Contra Costa counties, including Berkeley and Oakland. EBMUD holds water rights to almost all of the in the Mokulumne River watershed and in other watersheds. EBMUD also has an American River water right that could be sent to the Mokelumne Aqueduct through the Folsom South Canal.\n\nThe California Aqueduct is a system of canals, tunnels, and pipelines that conveys water collected from the Sierra Nevada mountains and valleys of Northern and Central California to Southern California. The Department of Water Resources (DWR) operates and maintains the California Aqueduct, including the two largest pumped-storage hydroelectric plants in California, Castaic and Gianelli. Gianelli is located at the base of San Luis Dam, which forms San Luis Reservoir, the largest off-stream reservoir in the United States. The Castaic Power Plant is located at the northern end of Castaic Lake, while Castaic Dam is located at the southern end.\n\nThe aqueduct begins at the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta at the Banks Pumping Plant, which pumps from the Clifton Court Forebay. Water is pumped by the Banks Pumping Plant to the Bethany Reservoir, which serves as a forebay for the South Bay Aqueduct via the South Bay Pumping Plant. From the Bethany Reservoir, the aqueduct flows by gravity approximately to the O'Neill Forebay at the San Luis Reservoir. From the O'Neill Forebay, it flows approximately to the Dos Amigos Pumping Plant. After Dos Amigos, the aqueduct flows about to where the Coastal Branch splits from the \"main line\". The split is approximately south-southeast of Kettleman City. After the Coastal Branch, the line continues by gravity another to the Buena Vista Pumping Plant. From the Buena Vista, it flows approximately to the Teerink Pumping Plant. After Teerink it flows about to the Chrisman Pumping Plant. Chrisman is the last pumping plant before the Edmonston Pumping Plant, which is from Chrisman. South of the plant the west branch splits off in a southwesterly direction to serve the Los Angeles Basin. At the Edmonston Pumping Plant it is pumped over the Tehachapi Mountains.\n\nWater flows through the aqueduct in a series of abrupt rises and gradual falls. The water flows down a long segment, built at a slight grade, and arrives at a pumping station powered by Path 66 or Path 15. The pumping station raises the water, where it again gradually flows downhill to the next station. However, where there are substantial drops, the water's potential energy is recaptured by hydroelectric plants. The initial pumping station fed by the Sacramento River Delta raises the water , while a series of pumps culminating at the Edmonston Pumping Plant raises the water over the Tehachapi Mountains. The Edmonston Pumping station requires so much power that several power lines off Path 15 and Path 26 are needed to ensure proper operation of the pumps.\n\nA typical section has a concrete-lined channel at the base and an average water depth of about . The widest section of the aqueduct is , and the deepest is . Channel capacity is , and the largest pumping plant capacity at Dos Amigos is .\n\nThe California State Water Project, commonly known as the SWP, is a water management project under the supervision of the California Department of Water Resources. The SWP is the world's largest publicly built and operated water and power development and conveyance system, providing drinking water for more than 23 million people and generating an average of 6,500 GWh of hydroelectricity annually. However, as the largest single consumer of power in the state, its net output in an \"average\" rainfall year is 5,100 GWh.\n\nThe SWP collects water from rivers in Northern California and redistributes it to the water-scarce but populous south through a network of aqueducts, pumping stations and hydroelectric plants. About 70% of the water provided by the project is used for urban areas and industry in Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area, and 30% is used for irrigation in the Central Valley. To reach Southern California, the water must be pumped over the Tehachapi Mountains—the highest single water lift in the world. The SWP shares many facilities with the federal Central Valley Project (CVP), which primarily serves agricultural users. Water can be interchanged between SWP and CVP canals as needed to meet peak requirements for project constituents. The SWP provides estimated annual benefits of $400 billion to California's economy.\n\nSince its inception in 1960, the SWP has required the construction of 21 dams and more than of canals, pipelines and tunnels, although these constitute only a fraction of the facilities originally proposed. As a result, the project has only delivered an average of annually, as compared to total entitlements of . Environmental concerns caused by the dry-season removal of water from the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, a sensitive estuary region, have often led to further reductions in water delivery. Work continues today to expand the SWP's water delivery capacity while finding solutions for the environmental impacts of water diversion.\n\nThe Colorado River Aqueduct, or CRA, is a water conveyance in Southern California, operated by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD). The aqueduct impounds water from the Colorado River at Lake Havasu on the California–Arizona border. This water is then transferred west by pumping stations, reservoirs, and canals across the Mojave and Colorado deserts to the east side of the Santa Ana Mountains. It is one of the primary sources of drinking water for Southern California.\n\nOriginally conceived by William Mulholland and designed by Chief Engineer Frank E. Weymouth of the MWD, it was the largest public works project in southern California during the Great Depression. The project employed 30,000 people over an eight-year period and as many as 10,000 at one time.\n\nThe system is composed of two reservoirs, five pumping stations, of canals, of tunnels, and of buried conduit and siphons. Average annual throughput is .\n\nDavis Dam is located on the Colorado River about downstream from Hoover Dam. Davis Dam stretches across the border between Arizona and Nevada and impounds the Colorado River to form Lake Mohave. The United States Bureau of Reclamation owns and operates the dam, which was completed in 1951. Davis Dam is a zoned earth fill dam with a concrete spillway, in length at the crest, and high. The earth fill dam begins on the Nevada side, but it does not extend to the Arizona side. Instead, there is an inlet formed by earth and concrete. At the end of the inlet is the spillway. The power plant is on the Arizona side of the inlet, perpendicular to the dam. This is a very unusual design. The hydroelectric plant generates between 1 and 2 terawatt-hours of electricity annually. The plant has a capacity of , and the tops of its five Francis turbines are visible from outside the plant. The plant's hydraulic head is . The dam's purpose is to generate hydroelectricity and regulate water releases into the Colorado River for use downstream by California, Arizona and Mexico.\n\nImperial Dam is a concrete slab and buttress, ogee weir structure across the Colorado River on the California–Arizona border, northeast of Yuma. Completed in the 1938, the dam retains the waters of the Colorado River in the Imperial Reservoir before desilting and diversion into the All-American Canal, the Gila River, and the Yuma Project aqueduct. Between 1932 and 1940, the Imperial Irrigation District relied on the Inter-California Canal, the Imperial Canal, and the Alamo River.\n\nImperial Dam was built to replace the Laguna Diversion Dam, built in 1901–1915, which was the first dam and reclamation project on the Colorado River. Imperial Dam was built with three sections; the gates of each section hold back the water to help divert the water towards the desilting plant. Three giant desilting basins and 72 scrapers hold and desilt the water; the removed silt is carried away by six sludge pipes running under the Colorado River that dump the sediment into the California sluiceway, which returns the silt to the Colorado River. The water is now directed back towards one of the three sections which divert the water into one of the three channels. About 90% of the volume of the Colorado River is diverted into the canals at this location. Diversions can top per second—more than 50 times the flow of the Rio Grande.\n\nThe Gila River and the Yuma Project aqueduct branch off toward Arizona, while the All-American Canal branches southwards for before reaching its headworks on the California border and bending west toward the Imperial Valley.\nThe All-American Canal is an aqueduct in southeastern California. It conveys water from the Colorado River into the Imperial Valley and to nine cities. It is the Imperial Valley's only water source, and replaced the Alamo Canal, which was located mostly in Mexico. The Imperial Dam, about northeast of Yuma, Arizona, on the Colorado River, diverts water into the All-American Canal, which runs to just west of Calexico, California, before its last branch heads mostly north into the Imperial Valley. Five smaller canals branching off the All-American Canal move water into the Imperial Valley. These canal systems irrigate up to of good cropland and have made possible a greatly increased crop yield in this area, originally one of the driest on earth. It is the largest irrigation canal in the world, carrying a maximum of . Agricultural runoff from the All-American Canal drains into the Salton Sea. The All-American Canal runs parallel to the Mexico–United States border for several miles.\n\nThe Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel (also known as the \"Sacramento River Deep Water Ship Channel\" or \"SRDWSC\") is a canal from the Port of Sacramento to the Sacramento River, which flows into San Francisco Bay. It was completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1963. The channel is about deep, wide, and long.\n\nThe Port of Sacramento has always been a significant port on the West Coast of the United States since the 1849 California Gold Rush. It was originally served primarily by paddle steamers which carried cargo from San Francisco Bay up the Sacramento River to Sacramento. Today it receives far less traffic than larger ports and handles primarily agricultural products and other bulk goods rather than containers, which now dominate the shipping market.\n\nOther engineering feats were the building of Hoover Dam, which though in Nevada, provides power and water to Southern California.\n\nAnother project was the draining of Tulare Lake, which during high water was the largest freshwater lake fully inside an American state. This created a large wet area amid the dry San Joaquin Valley, and swamps abounded at its shores. By the 1970s, it was completely drained, but it attempts to resurrect itself during heavy rains.\n\nThe recycling of treated municipal wastewater has become a significant part of California's water supply. The different water agencies in California were recycling over as of 2009, the date of the last survey. Some of the many uses for recycled water are: golf course irrigation 7%, landscape irrigation 17%, agricultural irrigation 37%, commercial reuse of water 7%, industrial uses 7%, geothermal energy production 1%, seawater intrusion barrier via fresh water injections 7%, groundwater recharge by well injection and flotation ponds 12%, recreational impoundments 4%, and natural wetland systems/restoration 4%. The stated goal is the recycling of of treated municipal wastewater.\n\nOn March 14, 2014, the State Water Board approved $800 million in financial incentives for recycled water projects. These projects typically take years to get approved and built.\n\nThe Water Replenishment District of Southern California (WRD), in service since 1959, is one of the more aggressive agencies that use recycled water for their groundwater replenishment and seawater intrusion barriers. To prevent seawater contamination of their groundwater, they have several sets of injection wells that inject clean water between their aquifer and the sea. This creates a local water barrier to seawater intrusion. The other mechanism is to make sure the water level is above sea level.\n\nWell users, including municipal water users, in the WRD area pump about of water per year out of their aquifer. This is an \"overdraft\" of about of water over what their underground aquifer can \"normally\" refill. To replace this \"overdraft\" of water into the aquifer, they have flotation ponds that catch rain runoff water, and supplement with other water they either buy or recycle, then let the water soak into the ground (spreading water) to help replenish the water in the aquifer(s). In addition they buy Colorado River water that is shipped via the Colorado River Aqueduct, and they accept part of the treated municipal wastewater of the about 4,000,000 people in their district and treat it to additional purity and sanitation levels by using reverse osmosis and advanced filtering. Their largest tertiary water treatment facility is the Leo J. Vander Lans Advanced Water Treatment facility. The water out of this facility is better than the water that comes out of the \"average\" municipal water treatment facility. To finance their water recycling projects WRD charges $268 per acre-foot of water pumped out, which generates about $65,000,000/year. WRD is now on a project (WIN) to enlarge their water treatment facilities to take larger quantities of treated municipal wastewater and treat enough of it that they will not have to buy Colorado River water. Overall it is estimated that this project provides over 40% of the water used in the Southern California district served by the WRD.\n\nAmong the many water recycling projects just being completed, the South Bay Water Recycling program distributes recycled water to more than 400 customers in the San Jose, area for irrigation, industrial and other purposes. In Northern California, two agencies have teamed up to develop the San Ramon Valley Recycled Water Program. Jointly sponsored by the Dublin San Ramon Services District and the East Bay Municipal Utility District, the program will provide recycled water to municipal parks, golf courses, business parks, greenbelts and roadways. The Irvine Ranch Water District has built a dual water system, which supplies recycled water to commercial high rises for use in flushing toilets and urinals. A West Basin Municipal Water District project distributes recycled water to more than 85 customers, including Chevron and Mobil refineries. Monterey County Water Recycling Projects provide recycled water for agricultural irrigation to help ease demands on an overused groundwater aquifer. The Padre Dam Water Recycling Facility was expanded to recycle 2 million gallons/day for turf irrigation at parks, golf courses and other commercial and industrial facilities.\n\nIn the San Diego region, 16 water agencies are planning to use over of recycled water per year in order to meet the region's water supply demand. The city of Carlsbad's new recycled water treatment and distribution system will deliver approximately } per year of recycled water to customers located in that community. In the southern portion of San Diego County, the Otay Water District is constructing a distribution system to deliver an estimated per year of recycled water by 2030 purchased from the city of San Diego's South Bay Water Recycling Plant. In Southern California, the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District is using recycled water to help replenish and enhance Lake Elsinore.\n\nThe Orange County Sanitation and Orange County Water Districts are planning for treated wastewater, currently discharged into the ocean, to undergo microfiltration, reverse osmosis and ultraviolet disinfection. The purified water will be equivalent in quality to distilled water and exceed all state and federal drinking water standards. The purified water will be pumped to spreading ponds near the Santa Ana River for percolation into the groundwater basin, with some injected through injection wells along the coast as a barrier to seawater intrusion. Like the WRD projects in Southern California, the Orange County Water District has amassed a long record of successfully recycling water with its Water Factory 21.\n\nOn December 24, 2012, the San Diego County Water Authority announced they had sold $734 million worth of tax-free bonds at 4.38% interest to build the Carlsbad Seawater Desalination Project, the largest seawater desalination plant in the Western Hemisphere. The project is located near the Encina Power Station in Carlsbad, and is expected to produce about of water per year by 2016 when the project is completed. The plant is expected to use over 17,000 reverse osmosis racks. The project includes $80 million in San Diego Water Authority upgrades to its own facilities. A pipeline is being built to deliver desalinated water into its Twin Oaks Valley Water Treatment Plant near San Marcos. The developer Poseidon Resources is building the plant and pipeline in a joint venture with contractor Kiewit Shea Desalination. The project will deliver up to 50 million gallons a day of drought-proof, highly reliable water that will become a core, day-to-day resource for the region. It is projected to meet about 7% of San Diego County's demand in 2020. The total cost is projected at $1,849 to $2,257 per acre-foot. The additional cost of desalinating seawater will add $5 to $7 per month to ratepayers' bills—about a 10% increase.\n\nThe present (2014) drought has brought reconsideration of the Charles Meyer Desalination Facility that was built for $34 million in the early 1990s in Santa Barbara but was later essentially mothballed when the drought was over. There are early discussions about investing around $20 million more to upgrade and restart the desalination plant. They have permits to make about of desalinated water per year, but they will incur additional costs to pump their desalinated water to existing higher elevation reservoirs if they reactivate the plant. The projected costs (2014) were about $3,000 per acre foot.\n\nThe small city of Sand City, located on the Monterey Peninsula, struck out on its own in 2007 to develop a small desalination plant. The city partnered with California American Water for the $14 million project, which started producing 300 acre feet of freshwater a year in 2010. The cost and water are shared with other nearby small communities.\n\nThe web site run by the California Department of Water Resources lists the present reservoir storage levels for each of California's major reservoirs. Individual reservoir capacities and percent of full are given for the major reservoirs. As of April 3, 2014, they had of water stored, or about 65% of the of water they usually would have at that time of year.\n\nAutomobile travel became important after 1910 when motor cars and trucks began to become common. Before that nearly all long-distance travel was by railroad or stagecoach, with horse- or mule-drawn wagons hauling the freight. A key route was the Lincoln Highway, which was America's first transcontinental road for motorized vehicles, connecting New York City to San Francisco. The creation of the Lincoln Highway in 1913 was a major stimulus on the development of both industry and tourism in the state. Similar effects occurred in 1926 with the creation of Route 66. The last large addition to the state highway system was made by the California State Assembly in 1959, after which only minor changes have been made. Most new highway construction was then done on the Interstate Highway System started under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who championed its formation.\n\nThe first state road was authorized on March 26, 1895, when a law created the post of \"Lake Tahoe Wagon Road Commissioner\" to maintain the Lake Tahoe Wagon Road (the 1852 Johnson's Cut-off of the California Trail), now US 50 from Smith Flat, east of Placerville, to the Nevada state line. The road had been operated as a privately owned toll road from about 1855 till 1886, when El Dorado County bought it; the county deeded the road to the state on February 28, 1896. Funding initially was only enough for minimal improvements, including a stone bridge over the South Fork American River in 1901.\n\nAlso in 1895, on March 27 the legislature created the three-person Bureau of Highways to coordinate efforts by the counties to build good roads. The bureau traveled to every county of the state in 1895 and 1896 and prepared a map of a recommended system of state roads, which they submitted to the governor on November 25, 1896. The legislature replaced the Bureau of Highways with the Department of Highways on April 1, 1897, three days after it passed a law creating a second state highway from Sacramento to Folsom – another part of what became US 50 – to be maintained by three \"Folsom Highway Commissioners\". This was the last highway maintained by a separate authority, as the next state road, the Mono Lake Basin State Road (now part of SR 120), was designated by the legislature in 1899 to be built and maintained by the Department of Highways. Construction of a large connected system began in 1912, after the state's voters approved an $18 million bond issue for over of highways. The Lincoln Highway when it was set up in 1913 used the Lake Tahoe Wagon Road (the 1852 Johnson's Cut-off of the California Trail), now US 50, to get over the Sierra Nevada.\n\nSeveral more state highways were legislated in the next decade, and the legislature passed a law creating the Department of Engineering on March 11, 1907. This new department, in addition to non-highway duties, was to maintain all state highways, including the Lake Tahoe Wagon Road. On March 22, 1909, the \"State Highways Act\" was passed, taking effect on December 31, 1910, after a successful vote by the people of the state in November. This law authorized the Department of Engineering to issue $18 million in bonds for a \"continuous and connected state highway system\" that would connect all county seats. To this end, the department created the three-member California Highway Commission on August 8, 1911, to take full charge of the construction and maintenance of this system. As with the 1896 plan by the Bureau of Highways, the Highway Commission traveled the state to determine the best routes, which ended up stretching about . Construction began in mid-1912, with groundbreaking on Contract One – now part of SR 82 in San Mateo County – on August 7. Noteworthy portions of the system built by the commission included the Ridge Route in southern California and the Yolo Causeway west from Sacramento.\n\nBecause the first bond issue did not provide enough funding, the \"State Highways Act of 1915\" was approved by the legislature on May 20, 1915, and the voters in November 1916, taking effect on December 31. This gave the Department of Engineering an additional $12 million to complete the original system and $3 million for a further approximately specified by the law. At this time, each route was assigned a number from 1 to 34; this system of labeling routes, although never marked with signs, remained until the 1964 renumbering. In 1917, the legislature gave the California Highway Commission statutory recognition, and turned over the approximately of roads adopted by legislative act, until then maintained by the State Engineer, to the commission. Where not serving as extensions of existing routes, these – and routes subsequently added legislatively in 1917 and 1919 – were given numbers from 35 to 45. A third bond issue was approved by the voters at a special election on July 1, 1919, and provided $20 million more for the existing routes and the same amount for new extensions totaling about , adding Routes 46 to 64 to the system. The three bond issues together totaled , of which just over 40% (60% if the 1919 bond issue is left out) was completed or under construction in mid-1920.\n\nThe Department of Engineering became part of the new Department of Public Works in 1921, and the California Highway Commission was entirely separated as its own department in 1923. In order to pay for the roads, a 2-cent per gallon gasoline tax was approved in 1923. The legislature continued to add highways to the system, including the Mother Lode Highway (now part of SR 49) in 1921 and the Arrowhead Trail (now I-15 north of Barstow) in 1925. In January 1928, the California State Automobile Association and Automobile Club of Southern California, which had already been placing guide and warning signs along state highways, marked the U.S. Highways along several of the most major state highways. The California Toll Bridge Authority was created in 1929 to acquire and operate all toll bridges on state highways, including the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and Carquinez Bridge.\n\nAfter 1927 and 1929, in which no highways were added to the system, the legislature authorized the construction of 23 new routes in 1931, which were numbered from 72 to 80 when not forming extensions of existing routes. Two years later, another 213 sections of highway were added, almost doubling the total length of state highways to about ; the last-assigned route number jumped from 80 to 202. Many of these new routes, as well as a number of existing routes, were incorporated into the initial system of state sign routes in 1934, also posted by the auto clubs.\n\nThe Division of Highways took over signage on state highways from the auto clubs in 1947, though at least the Auto Club of Southern California continued to place signs on city streets until 1956.\n\nThe first decades of the twentieth century saw the rise of the film studio system. MGM, Universal and Warner Brothers all acquired land in Hollywood, which was then a small subdivision known as \"Hollywoodland\" on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The enormous variety in terrain and the year-round sunshine made filmmaking easier and cheaper, and actors, producers, financiers and craftsmen headed to Hollywood.\n\nThe movies made California even better known, attracting hundreds of thousands of migrants, especially from the Midwest, who loved the mild Mediterranean climate, cheap land, and new jobs.\n\nBy the 1930s, Hollywood had extended its reach into radio, and by 1950 Southern California had also become a major center of television production, hosting studios for major networks such as NBC and CBS.\n\nIn 1883–1886, John J. Montgomery began experimenting with gliders. He made the first controlled flights in a heavier-than-air flying machine in America. Montgomery was killed in 1911 in a glider-related accident.\n\nAfter Wilbur and Orville Wright demonstrated the feasibility of controlled manned flight, Glenn Curtiss entered the field, focusing on aircraft manufacturing and pilot training. Part of this training was done in California.\n\nThe Los Angeles International Air Meet (January 10 to January 20, 1910) was among the earliest air shows in the world and the first major air show in the United States. It was held in Los Angeles County at Dominguez Field in present-day Compton. Spectator turnout numbered approximately 254,000 over 11 days of ticket sales. The \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"one of the greatest public events in the history of the West.\"\n\nOn November 29, 1910, Glenn H. Curtiss wrote to Secretary of the Navy George von L. Meyer offering flight instruction without charge for one Navy officer as one means of assisting \"in developing the adaptability of the aeroplane to military purposes.\" In the winter of 1910, Glenn Curtiss established a private flying school on North Island, on land obtained through the cooperation of the Aero Club of San Diego. He soon invited the Army and Navy to send officers to receive free instruction as \"aeroplane pilots\". On December 23, 1910, Lieut. T. Gordon \"Spuds\" Ellyson was ordered to report to the Glenn Curtiss Aviation Camp at North Island in San Diego. He completed his training April 12, 1911, and became Naval Aviator No. 1. The original site of this winter encampment is now part of Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego and is referred to by the Navy as \"The Birthplace of Naval Aviation\".\n\nOn January 18, 1911, at 11:01 a.m., Eugene Ely, flying a Curtiss pusher, landed on a specially built platform aboard the armored cruiser USS \"Pennsylvania\" at anchor in San Francisco Bay. At 11:58 a.m., he took off and returned to Selfridge Field, San Francisco.\n\nCaltech in Pasadena provided an ideal situation for the development and manufacture of aircraft. In 1925, aircraft builder Donald Douglas and \"Los Angeles Times\" publisher Harry Chandler worked together with Caltech president Robert Millikan to bring a state-of-the-art aeronautical research laboratory to the Pasadena college. Douglas recruited some of Caltech's best and brightest students for his company. Douglas utilized the lab's wind tunnel and research staff while designing his DC-1, 2, and 3. In this way, the DC-3, undoubtedly one of the most successful aircraft designs ever built, represented more than just a single designer's project. It was a regional product, the result of an alliance of business and science created over the preceding five decades.\n\nThe Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) traces its beginnings to 1936 in the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT), when the first set of rocket experiments were carried out in the Arroyo Seco. Caltech graduate students Frank Malina, Weld Arnold, Apollo M. O. Smith, and Tsien Hsue-shen, along with Jack Parsons and Edward S. Forman, tested a small, alcohol-fueled motor to gather data for Malina's graduate thesis. Malina's thesis adviser was engineer-aerodynamicist Theodore von Kármán, who eventually arranged for United States Army financial support for this \"GALCIT Rocket Project\" in 1939. In 1941, Malina, Parsons, Forman, Martin Summerfield, and pilot Homer Bushey demonstrated the first jet-assisted takeoff rockets (JATO units) to the Army. In 1943, von Kármán, Malina, Parsons, and Forman established the Aerojet Corporation to manufacture JATO motors. The project took on the name Jet Propulsion Laboratory in November 1943, formally becoming an Army facility operated under contract by the university.\n\nDuring JPL's Army years, the laboratory developed two deployed weapon systems, the MGM-5 Corporal and MGM-29 Sergeant intermediate range ballistic missiles, the first US ballistic missiles developed at JPL. It also developed a number of other weapons system prototypes, such as the Loki anti-aircraft missile system, and the forerunner of the Aerobee sounding rocket. At various times, it carried out rocket testing at the White Sands Proving Ground, Edwards Air Force Base, and Goldstone, California. A lunar lander was also developed in 1938–39 which influenced design of the Apollo Lunar Module in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1954, JPL teamed up with Wernher von Braun's rocketeers at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, to propose orbiting a satellite during the International Geophysical Year. The team lost that proposal to Project Vanguard, and instead embarked on a classified project to demonstrate ablative re-entry technology using a Jupiter-C rocket. They carried out three successful sub-orbital flights in 1956 and 1957. Using a spare Jupiter-C, the two organizations then launched America's first satellite, \"Explorer 1\", on February 1, 1958.\n\nJPL was transferred to NASA in December 1958, becoming the agency's primary planetary spacecraft center. JPL engineers designed and operated Ranger and Surveyor missions to the Moon that prepared the way for the Apollo program. JPL also led the way in interplanetary exploration with the Mariner missions to Venus, Mars, and Mercury. In 1998, JPL opened the Near-Earth Object Program Office for NASA; as of 2013, it has found 95% of asteroids that are a kilometer or more in diameter that cross Earth's orbit.\n\nIn 1940, 65% of aircraft manufacturers were located along or near the East or West Coasts of the United States. California alone had 44 percent of all aircraft manufacturing. In 1944, 12 states shared 85 percent of airframe floor space, and California's percentage had dropped to 24%. Engine and propeller manufacturing had also decentralized. Most wartime expansion took place inland due to concerns over possible coastal attacks. After the war, massive layoffs occurred as wartime orders were cancelled.\n\nMajor manufacturers of aircraft in California were/are Douglas Aircraft Company, Lockheed Corporation, Boeing, Hughes Aircraft, Glenn L. Martin Company, North American Aviation, Northrop Corporation, Vultee, and many others. Many of these early companies would disappear or consolidate with other companies. However, a few would grow to become giants in the industry.\n\nGallery of aircraft and spacecraft built and developed (wholly or in part) in California. Many more could be included.\n\nDuring World War II, California's mild climate became a major resource for the war effort. Numerous air-training bases were established in Southern California, where most aircraft manufacturers, including Douglas Aircraft and Hughes Aircraft, expanded or established factories. Major naval shipyards were established or expanded in San Diego, Long Beach, and Mare Island in San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe four Richmond Shipyards, located in the city of Richmond, California, were run by Permanente Metals and Kaiser Shipyards. The Richmond yards were responsible for constructing more Liberty ships during World War II (747) than any other shipyard in the United States. Liberty ships were chosen for mass production because their somewhat obsolete design was relatively simple and their triple expansion piston steam engine components were simple enough that they could be made by several companies that were not highly needed to manufacture other parts. Ship building was given a high priority for steel and other needed components, as the German U-boats until 1944 sunk more ships than could be built by all the shipyards in the United States. The United States shipyards built about 5,926 ships in World War II plus over 100,000 more smallcraft made for the U.S. Army naval components.\n\nHenry J. Kaiser's company had been building cargo ships for the U.S. Maritime Commission in the late 1930s. In 1940 orders for ships from the British government, already at war with Nazi Germany, allowed for growth. Kaiser established his first Richmond shipyard beginning in December 1940, eventually building three more in Richmond; each yard with four to eight slips to build ships. Kaiser-Permanente specialized in mass-producing Liberty ships quickly and efficiently, and that was all they built until 1944, when they switched to the much more complicated Victory ships and built some tugs and Landing Ship, Tank (LSTs) and other specialized ships in the newly built Yard #4.\n\n747 EC2-S-C1 Liberty ship cargo transports were built. The following references list individual ships built:\n\nThese Liberty ships were completed in two-thirds the amount of time and at a quarter of the cost of the average of all other shipyards. The Liberty ship was assembled in less than five days as a part of a special competition among shipyards; but by 1944 it was only taking the astonishingly brief time of a little over two weeks to assemble a Liberty ship by standard methods. They pre-assembled major parts of the ship including the hull sections at various locations in the shipyard and then, when needed, moved them with heavy lift cranes to the shipyard launching site, where they welded the pre-built sections together. After the ships were launched they were finished to their final configuration while afloat, and the launchway was available to start building another ship.\n\nIn 1945, the shipyards were shut down as quickly as they had started up four years earlier. Much of the shoreline previously occupied by the shipyards is now owned by the city of Richmond and has been cleaned up and redeveloped under federally assisted \"brownfields\" programs. The Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park was established on the shipyard site to commemorate and interpret the role of the home front in winning World War II.\n\n\nCalifornia Shipbuilding Corporation (often called Calship) built 467 Liberty and Victory ships during World War II, including \"Haskell\"-class attack transports. The Calship shipyard was created at Terminal Island in Los Angeles as part of the World War II shipbuilding effort. It was initially eight ways, then increased to 14. After the war, it was liquidated. The ships they built were:\n\nMare Island, near the city of Vallejo, was the site of the first naval base in California. The Napa River forms the eastern side of the island as the river enters the Carquinez Strait at its juncture with the east side of San Pablo Bay. In 1850, Commodore John Drake Sloat, in charge of a commission to find a California naval base, recommended the island across the Napa River from the settlement of Vallejo, it being \"free from ocean gales and from floods and freshets.\"\n\nOn November 6, 1850, two months after California was admitted to statehood, President Millard Fillmore reserved Mare Island for government use. The United States Navy Department acted favorably on Commodore Sloat's recommendations, and Mare Island was purchased in July 1852, for the sum of $83,410, for the use as a naval shipyard. Two years later, on September 16, 1854, Mare Island became the first permanent United States naval installation on the West Coast, with Commodore David G. Farragut as Mare Island's first base commander. For more than a century, Mare Island served as the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. A drydock was built by the Public Works Department on an excellent rock foundation of cut granite blocks. The work took nineteen years and was completed in 1891. During the Spanish–American War, a concrete drydock on wooden piles, long, was completed after eleven years of work, in 1910. By 1941, a third drydock had been completed, and drydock number four was under construction. The ammunitions depot and submarine repair base were modern, fireproof buildings. A million-dollar, three-way vehicle causeway to Vallejo was completed.\n\nBefore World War II, Mare Island had been in a continual state of upbuilding. By 1941, new projects included improvements to the central power plant, a new pattern storage building, a large foundry, machine shop, magazine building, paint shop, new administration building, and a huge storehouse. The yard was expected to be able to repair and paint six to eight large naval vessels at a time. Several finger piers had recently been built, as well as a new shipbuilding wharf, adding one and one berth. It employed 5,593 workers at the beginning of 1939, and rapidly increased to 18,500 busily engaged by May 1941, with a monthly payroll of $3,500,000 (1941). Then came the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1941, the drafting department had expanded to three buildings accommodating over 400 naval architects, engineers and draftsmen. The hospital carried 584 bed patients. Mare Island became one of the Navy's shipbuilding sites in World War II specializing in building diesel engine-powered submarines; they eventually built 32 of them. After the war was over, Mare Island became a premier site for building nuclear-powered submarines, building 27 of them.\n\nIn 1969, the Navy transferred its (Vietnam War) Brown Water Navy Riverine Training Forces from Coronado, California, to Mare Island. Swift Boats (Patrol Craft Fast-PCF), and PBRs (Patrol Boat River), among other types of riverine craft, conducted boat operations throughout the currently named Napa-Sonoma Marshes State Wildlife Area, which are located on the north and west portions of Mare Island. Mare Island Naval Base was deactivated during the 1995 cycle of US base closures, but the US Navy Reserves still have access to the water portions of the State Wildlife Area for any riverine warfare training being conducted from their new base in Sacramento.\n\nIn 1996 Mare Island Naval Shipyard was closed.\n\nNaval Base San Diego was started on land acquired in 1920. It is the largest base of the United States Navy on the west coast of the United States. Naval Base San Diego is the principal homeport of the Pacific Fleet, consisting of 54 ships and over 120 tenant commands. The base is composed of 13 piers stretched over of land and of water. The total on-base population is 20,000 military personnel and 6,000 civilians. San Diego has become the home port of the largest naval fleet in the world, and includes two supercarriers, as well as U.S. Marine Corps stations, United States Navy ports, and U.S. Coast Guard installations.\n\nAfter the war, hundreds of land developers bought land cheap, subdivided it, built on it, and got rich. Real estate development replaced oil and agriculture as Southern California's principal industry. In 1955, Disneyland opened in Anaheim. In 1958, Major League Baseball's Dodgers and Giants left New York City and came to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. The population of California expanded dramatically, to nearly 20 million by 1970.\n\nIn the late 1960s the baby-boom generation reached draft age, and many risked arrest to oppose the war in Vietnam. There were numerous demonstrations and strikes, most famously on the prestigious Berkeley campus of the University of California, across the bay from San Francisco. In 1965, race riots erupted in Watts, in the South Central area of Los Angeles. The hippie riots on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles were immortalized by Buffalo Springfield in the song \"For What It's Worth\" (1966). Some commentators predicted revolution. Then the federal government promised to withdraw from the Vietnam War, which at last happened in 1974. The radical political movements, having achieved a large part of their aim, lost members and funding.\n\nCalifornia still was a land of free spirits, open hearts, and easy-going living. Popular music of the period bore titles such as \"California Girls,\" \"California Dreamin',\" \"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair),\" \"Do You Know the Way to San Jose\" and \"Hotel California\". These reflected the Californian promise of easy living in a paradisaical climate. The surfing culture burgeoned. Many people took low-paying jobs and joined the surfers living in trailers at the beach, and many others forsook ambition and joined the hippies living in cities.\n\nThe most famous hippie hangout was the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. The state's cities, especially San Francisco, became famous for their gentility and tolerance. A distinctive and idyllic Californian culture emerged for a time. The peak of this culture, in 1967, was known as the Summer of Love. California became known elsewhere in the United States often derogatorily, as the \"land of fruits and nuts\".\n\nConversely, during the same period, the Golden State also attracted commercial and industrial expansion at astronomical rates. The adoption of a Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960 allowed the development of a highly efficient system of public higher education in the community colleges and the University of California and California State University systems; by creating an educated workforce, it attracted investment, particularly in areas related to high technology. By 1980, California became recognized as the world's eighth-largest economy. Millions of workers were needed to fuel the expansion. The high population of the time caused tremendous problems with urban sprawl, traffic, pollution, and, to a lesser extent, crime.\n\nUrban sprawl created a backlash in many areas, with local governments limiting growth beyond certain boundaries, reducing lot sizes for building homes, and so on. Open space districts were created in several parts of the state specifically to obtain, manage, and preserve undeveloped land. For example, in the San Francisco Bay Area, the open space districts have created a nearly contiguous range of permanently undeveloped land running through the coastal range and hills surrounding the Bay's urban valleys, enabling the creation of huge natural parks and envisioning a hiking trail that will eventually circumnavigate the Bay in an unbroken loop.\n\nThe immense problem with air pollution (smog) that had developed by the early 1970s also caused a backlash. With schools being closed routinely in urban areas for \"smog days\" when the ozone levels became too unhealthy and the hills surrounding urban areas seldom visible even within a mile, Californians were ready for changes. Over the next three decades, California enacted some of the strictest anti-smog regulations in the United States and has been a leader in encouraging nonpolluting strategies for various industries, including automobiles. For example, carpool lanes normally allow only vehicles with two/three or more occupants (whether the base number is two or three depends on what freeway you are on), but electric cars can use the lanes with only a single occupant. As a result, smog is significantly reduced from its peak, although local Air Quality Management Districts still monitor the air and generally encourage people to avoid polluting activities on hot days when smog is expected to be at its worst.\n\nTraffic and transportation remain a problem in urban areas. Solutions are implemented, but inevitably the implementation expense and the time required to plan, approve, and build infrastructure can't keep pace with the population growth. There have been some improvements. Carpool lanes have become common in urban areas, which are intended to encourage people to drive together rather than in individual automobiles. San Jose is gradually building a light rail system (often over routes of an original turn-of-the-century electric railroad line that was torn out and paved over to encourage the advent of the automobile age). None of the implemented solutions are without their critics. The sprawling nature of the Bay Area and of the Los Angeles Basin makes it difficult to build mass transit that can reach and serve a significant portion of the population.\n\nDuring the 1960s, under the aegis of Chief Justice Roger J. Traynor, the California Supreme Court became more liberal and progressive. Traynor's term as Chief Justice (from 1964 to 1970) was marked by a number of firsts: California was the first state to create true strict liability in product liability cases, the first to allow the action of negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) even in the absence of physical injury to the plaintiff, and the first to allow bystanders to sue for NIED where the only physical injury was to a relative.\n\nStarting in the 1960s, California became a leader in family law. California was the first state to allow true no-fault divorce, with the passage of the Family Law Act of 1969. In 1994, the Legislature took family law out of the Civil Code and created a new Family Code. In 2002, the Legislature granted registered domestic partners the same rights under state law as married spouses. In 2008 California became the second state to legalize same-sex marriage when the California Supreme Court ruled the ban unconstitutional.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, the California Supreme Court has become more conservative, particularly with regard to the rights of criminal defendants. This is commonly seen as a reaction against the strict anti-death penalty stance of Chief Justice Rose Bird in the early 1980s, although the funding that eventually brought about her defeat was from corporate and business interests concerned with what they felt was an anti-business stance by the Chief Justice. The state's electorate responded by removing her (and two of her perceived liberal allies) from the court in November 1986.\n\nStarting in the 1950s, high technology companies in Northern California began a spectacular growth that continued through the end of the 20th century. The major products included personal computers, video games, and networking systems. The majority of these companies settled along a highway stretching from Palo Alto to San Jose, notably including Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, all in the Santa Clara Valley, the so-called \"Silicon Valley\", named after the material used to produce the integrated circuits of the era.\n\nThis era peaked in 2000, by which time demand for skilled technical professionals had become so high that the high-tech industry had trouble filling all of its positions and therefore pushed for increased visa quotas so that they could recruit from overseas. When the \"Dot-com bubble\" burst in 2001, jobs evaporated overnight, and for the first time over the next two years more people moved out of the area than moved in. This somewhat mirrored the collapse of the aerospace industry in southern California some twenty years earlier.\n\nAlthough air pollution problems have been reduced, health problems associated with pollution have continued. The brown haze known as \"smog\" has been substantially abated thanks to federal and state restrictions on automobile exhaust.\n\nAn energy crisis in 2001 led to rolling blackouts, soaring power rates, and the importation of electricity from neighboring states. Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Company came under heavy criticism.\n\nThe ongoing demand for well-educated workers continued. Housing prices in urban areas continued to increase so that a modest home that in the 1960s cost $25,000, cost half a million dollars or more in urban areas by 2005. More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas. Speculators bought houses they never intended to live in, expecting to make a huge profit in a matter of months, then rolling it over by buying more properties. Mortgage companies were compliant, as everyone assumed the prices would keep rising. The bubble burst in 2007-8 as housing prices began to crash and the boom years ended. Hundreds of billions in property values vanished and foreclosures soared as many financial institutions and investors were badly hurt.\n\nIn the 2002 gubernatorial campaign, Democratic incumbent Gray Davis defeated Republican challenger Bill Simon. On October 7, 2003, Davis was recalled, with 55.4% of the voters supporting the recall (see results of the 2003 California recall). With a plurality of 48.6% of the vote, Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was chosen as the new governor. Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante received 31.5% of the vote, and Republican state senator Tom McClintock received 13.5% of the vote.\n\nSchwarzenegger began his shortened term with a soaring approval rating and soon after began implementing a conservative agenda. This initially resulted in sparring with the heavily Democratic Assembly and Senate over the state budget, battles which provided his infamous \"girly men\" comment but also began taking their toll on his approval rating. Schwarzenegger then embarked on a campaign to enact several ballot propositions in a 2005 special election touted as reforming California's budget system, redistricting powers, and union political fundraising. The union-led campaign spearheaded by the California Nurses Association contributed heavily to the defeat of every proposition in the special election.\n\nSince this conspicuous failure, Schwarzenegger made a turn back to the left, criticizing the Bush Administration at many junctures, reviving his environmental agenda, and compromising with the legislature on the traditionally Democratic issue of education spending. His approval rating also revived, and he was re-elected in 2006. However, continued paralysis in state government and the inability of the legislature and governor to work out the fundamental funding questions resulted in voter disapproval of both the legislators and the governor, whose approval rating was among the lowest ever recorded pending the election of Jerry Brown in November 2010.\n\nThe 2014 Pew Religious Landscape Survey showed the religious makeup of California as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2070188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070188", "title": "Lebesgue constant (interpolation)", "text": "Lebesgue constant (interpolation)\n\nIn mathematics, the Lebesgue constants (depending on a set of nodes and of its size) give an idea of how good the interpolant of a function (at the given nodes) is in comparison with the best polynomial approximation of the function (the degree of the polynomials are obviously fixed). The Lebesgue constant for polynomials of degree at most and for the set of nodes is generally denoted by . These constants are named after Henri Lebesgue.\n\nWe fix the interpolation nodes formula_1and an interval formula_2containing all the interpolation nodes. The process of interpolation maps the function formula_3 to a polynomial formula_4. This defines a mapping formula_5 from the space \"C\"([\"a\", \"b\"]) of all continuous functions on [\"a\", \"b\"] to itself. The map \"X\" is linear and it is a projection on the subspace of polynomials of degree or less.\n\nThe Lebesgue constant formula_6 is defined as the operator norm of \"X\". This definition requires us to specify a norm on \"C\"([\"a\", \"b\"]). The uniform norm is usually the most convenient.\n\nThe Lebesgue constant bounds the interpolation error: let denote the best approximation of \"f\" among the polynomials of degree or less. In other words, minimizes among all \"p\" in Π. Then\n\nWe will here prove this statement with the maximum norm.\n\nby the triangle inequality. But \"X\" is a projection on Π, so\n\nThis finishes the proof since formula_9. Note that this relation comes also as a special case of Lebesgue's lemma.\n\nIn other words, the interpolation polynomial is at most a factor worse than the best possible approximation. This suggests that we look for a set of interpolation nodes with a small Lebesgue constant.\n\nThe Lebesgue constant can be expressed in terms of the Lagrange basis polynomials:\n\nIn fact, we have the Lebesgue function\n\nand the Lebesgue constant (or Lebesgue number) for the grid is its maximum value\n\nNevertheless, it is not easy to find an explicit expression for .\n\nIn the case of equidistant nodes, the Lebesgue constant grows exponentially. More precisely, we have the following asymptotic estimate\n\nOn the other hand, the Lebesgue constant grows only logarithmically if Chebyshev nodes are used, since we have\n\nWe conclude again that Chebyshev nodes are a very good choice for polynomial interpolation. However, there is an easy (linear) transformation of Chebyshev nodes that gives a better Lebesgue constant. Let denote the -th Chebyshev node. Then, define\n\nFor such nodes:\n\nThose nodes are, however, not optimal (i.e. they do not minimize the Lebesgue constants) and the search for an optimal set of nodes (which has already been proved to be unique under some assumptions) is still an intriguing topic in mathematics today. However, this set of nodes is optimal for interpolation over formula_17 the set of times differentiable functions whose -th derivatives are bounded in absolute values by a constant as shown by N. S. Hoang. \nUsing a computer, one can approximate the values of the minimal Lebesgue constants, here for the canonical interval :\n\nThere are uncountable infinitely many sets of nodes in [-1,1] that minimize, for fixed > 1, the Lebesgue constant. Though if we assume that we always take −1 and 1 as nodes for interpolation (which is called a \"canonical\" node configuration), then such a set is unique and zero-symmetric. To illustrate this property, we shall see what happens when \"n\" = 2 (i.e. we consider 3 interpolation nodes in which case the property is not trivial). One can check that each set of (zero-symmetric) nodes of type is optimal when (we consider only nodes in [−1, 1]). If we force the set of nodes to be of the type , then \"b\" must equal 0 (look at the Lebesgue function, whose maximum is the Lebesgue constant). All \"arbitrary\" (i.e. zero-symmetric or zero-asymmetric) optimal sets of nodes in [-1,1] when \"n\" = 2 have been determined by F. Schurer, and in an alternative fashion by H.-J. Rack and R. Vajda (2014).\n\nIf we assume that we take −1 and 1 as nodes for interpolation, then as shown by H.-J. Rack (1984 and 2013), for the case \"n\" = 3, the explicit values of the optimal (unique and zero-symmetric) 4 interpolation nodes and the explicit value of the minimal Lebesgue constant are known. All \"arbitrary\" optimal sets of 4 interpolation nodes in [-1,1] when \"n\" = 3 have been explicitly determined, in two different but equivalent fashions, by H.-J. Rack and R. Vajda (2015).\n\nThe Padua points provide another set of nodes with slow growth (although not as slow as the Chebyshev nodes) and with the additional property of being a unisolvent point set.\n\nThe Lebesgue constants also arise in another problem. Let \"p\"(\"x\") be a polynomial of degree expressed in the Lagrangian form associated with the points in the vector \"t\" (i.e. the vector \"u\" of its coefficients is the vector containing the values formula_18). Let formula_19 be a polynomial obtained by slightly changing the coefficients \"u\" of the original polynomial \"p\"(\"x\") to formula_20. Consider the inequality:\n\nThis means that the (relative) error in the values of formula_19 will not be higher than the appropriate Lebesgue constant times the relative error in the coefficients. In this sense, the Lebesgue constant can be viewed as the relative condition number of the operator mapping each coefficient vector \"u\" to the set of the values of the polynomial with coefficients \"u\" in the Lagrange form. We can actually define such an operator for each polynomial basis but its condition number is greater than the optimal Lebesgue constant for most convenient bases.\n\n"}

A spin-off company of the University of Surrey, it is presently wholly owned by Airbus Defence and Space.\n\nThe company began out of research efforts centred upon amateur radio satellites, known by the UoSAT (University of Surrey Satellite) name or by an OSCAR (Orbital Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio) designation. SSTL was founded in 1985, following successful trials on the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components on satellites, cumulating in the \"UoSat-1\" test satellite. It funds research projects with the university's Surrey Space Centre, which does research into satellite and space topics.\n\nIn April 2008, Surrey University agreed to sell its majority share in the company to European multinational conglomerate EADS Astrium. In August 2008, SSTL opened a US subsidiary, which included both offices and a production site in Denver, Colorado; in 2017, the company decided to discontinue manufacturing activity in the US, winding up this subsidiary.\n\nSSTL was awarded the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement in 1998, and the Queen's Awards for Enterprise in 2005. In 2006 SSTL won the \"Times Higher Education\" award for outstanding contribution to innovation and technology. In 2009, SSTL ranked 89 out of the 997 companies that took part in the \"Sunday Times Top 100 companies to work for\".\n\nIn 2020, SSTL started the creation of a telecommunications spacecraft for lunar missions. It will be completed in 2024 and used for data transmission to Earth.\n\nDuring the early decades of the Cold War era, access to space was effectively the privilege of a handful of superpowers; by the 1970s, only the most affluent of countries could afford to engage in space programmes due to extreme complexity and expensive involved. Despite the exorbitant costs to produce and launch, early satellites could only offer limited functionality, having no ability to be reprogrammed once in orbit. During the late 1970s, a group of researchers at the University of Surrey, headed by Martin Sweeting, were experimenting with the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components in satellite construction; if found viable, such techniques would be highly disruptive to the established satellite industry.\n\nThe team's first satellite, \"UoSat-1\", was assembled in a small university lab, using in a cleanroom fabricated from B&Q and integrating printed circuit boards designed by hand on a kitchen table. In 1981, UoSAT-1 was launched with NASA's aid; representing the first modern reprogrammable small satellite, it outlived its planned three-year life by more than five years. Having successfully demonstrated that relatively compact and inexpensive satellites could be rapidly built to perform sophisticated missions, the team decided to take further steps to commercialise their research.\n\nDuring 1985, Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) was founded in Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom as a spin-off venture from the university. Since its founding, it has steadily grown, having worked with numerous international customers to launch over 70 satellites over the course of three decades.\n\nIn 2002, SSTL moved into remote sensing services with the launch of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) and an associated child company, DMC International Imaging. Some of these satellites also include other imaging payloads and experimental payloads: onboard hardware-based image compression (on BilSAT), a GPS reflectometry experiment and onboard Internet router (on the UK-DMC satellite). The DMC satellites are notable for communicating with their ground stations using the Internet Protocol for payload data transfer and command and control, so extending the Internet into space, and allowing experiments with the Interplanetary Internet to be carried out. Many of the technologies used in the design of the DMC satellites, including Internet Protocol use, were tested in space beforehand on SSTL's earlier UoSAT-12 satellite.\n\nDuring June 2004, American private space company SpaceX arranged to acquire a 10% stake in SSTL from Surrey University; speaking on the purchase, Elon Musk stated: \"SSTL is a high-quality company that is probably the world leader in small satellites. We look at this as more a case of similar corporate cultures getting together\". In April 2008, Surrey University agreed to sell its majority share in SSTL, roughly 80% of the company's capital, to European multinational conglomerate EADS Astrium. SSTL has remained an independent entity despite all shares having been purchased by Airbus, the parent company of EADS Astrium.\n\nDuring 2005, SSTL completed construction of \"GIOVE-A1\", the first test satellite for Europe's Galileo space navigation system. In 2010 and 2012, the firm was awarded contracts to supply 22 navigation payloads for Galileo, the last of which was delivered during 2016. During 2017, SSTL was awarded a contract to supply a further 12 payloads; this was viewed as a coup in light of the political backdrop surrounding Brexit.\n\nDuring the 2010s, SSTL has been working on various improvements in its satellite technology, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as well as smaller and lighter units. According to Luis Gomes, SSTL's head of Earth observation, micro-satellites translate to a lower cost of design, construction and launch, albeit at a cost of a more frequent failure rate, in comparison to larger and more costly units. These features has been marketed towards customers such as the DMC.\n\nIn summer 2008, Surrey formed an American subsidiary, \"Surrey Satellite Technology-US\", in Englewood, Colorado, intent on serving US customers in the smallsat market. In June 2017, SSTL announced their intention to close their Colorado satellite manufacturing facility, opting to instead consolidate all of its manufacturing activity in the UK. Sarah Parker, SSTL's managing director, the rapid growth of new competing firms in the small satellite sector had changed the marketplace, necessitating reorganisation, which has included the increased use of outsourcing.\n\n\n\n"}

Its main base was Simón Bolívar International Airport, Maiquetía (Caracas).\n\nThe airline was established on 1 November 1995 and started operations on 1 March 1997. At March 2000, the airline had 80 employees and a fleet of three ATR42-300s to serve both a domestic and a regional network that consisted of Aruba, Barquisimeto, Barranquilla, Caracas, Coro, Curaçao, Las Piedras, Maracaibo, Mérida, Santa Barbara Zulia and Valencia. It wholly owned Islas Airways until September 2006, when Islas was sold to the Canary Islands company Grupo SOAC. Santa Barbara Airlines was rechristened as \"SBA Airlines\" in 2007 following the acquisition of the carrier by Aserca.\n\nAt first it only covered airline flights to Cabimas, Mérida, El Vigía and Santa Bárbara del Zulia. The route to Alberto Carnevali Airport in Mérida was diverted to El Vigía-Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo International Airport after the crash of Flight 518.

He most recently worked for Texas Wesleyan University serving as the Assistant Head Coach under former teammate Mike Jeffcoat.\n\nGreer attended high school in Albertville, Alabama before playing college baseball at the University of Montevallo. (Montevallo was the only college interested in Greer prior to a senior-year all-star game where he finally drew attention from larger schools; however, he chose to remain at Montevallo since they initially offered him a scholarship.) While at Montevallo, Greer was a Resident Assistant in Napier Hall. The Rangers made him their tenth-round pick (279th overall) in the 1990 amateur draft, and he spent the rest of the season playing for their rookie-level minor league club in Butte, Montana. He would spend all 15 years of his professional baseball career in the Rangers organization, a feat that had become a rarity among professional ballplayers thanks to free agency.\n\nAt Butte, he batted .345 with an OPS of 1.032, which earned him a promotion to the Class A Florida State League the following season. He finished 1991 with the Class AA Tulsa Drillers in the Texas League; he stayed with Tulsa through 1992 and most of 1993, before being called up to the Class AAA Oklahoma City 89ers for eight games. He also started the 1994 season with the 89ers, batting .315 in 31 games, when he earned a call-up to the Rangers.\nRusty currently can be heard as a weekly guest on B.A.D. radio (The Bob and Dan Show) which airs 12:00-3:00 p.m. on 1310/96.7 KTCK \"The Ticket\" in Dallas, Tx. talking Texas Rangers baseball.\n\nGreer continued his successful run at Oklahoma when he was called up to Texas, where he batted .314 with ten home runs in 80 games, including one in his second major-league at bat, thus becoming the second Ranger to accomplish this feat. (Rubén Sierra was the first on June 1, 1986 at Kansas City) He also played an integral part in baseball history against the Anaheim Angels on July 28, 1994, when he made a diving catch of Rex Hudler's fly ball to protect a perfect game by Kenny Rogers. Although that was one of the most significant catches he made in his career, he made many others like it, and his all-out style of play made him a fan favorite throughout his major-league career. Greer also caught Gary DiSarcina's fly ball for the game's final out.\n\nGreer cooled off slightly in his second season, batting .271. However, in 1996, he had one of the best seasons of his career, batting .332 (fifth in the American League) and having his first of three 100-RBI seasons.\n\nThe 1997 season also proved successful for Greer, as he finished seventh in the AL with a .321 batting average, played in a career-high 157 games, and he hit a career-high 26 home runs. In 1998, he had a career-high 108 RBI and a .306 batting average. The Rangers honored him for his contributions by granting him a new contract that paid him $3.3 million in 1999, up from $1.025 million the previous season. In 1999, he batted an even .300 with 20 home runs, 101 RBI, and a career-high 96 walks (to go with 67 strikeouts). In the 2000 season, he was limited to 105 games due to injuries and posted a batting average of .297, with eight home runs.\n\nIn 2001, Greer was limited to 62 games because of injuries, but he still hit seven home runs. Still a fan favorite, he was honored with a three-year, $21 million contract before the 2002 season. However, due to injuries he would only play 51 games with the Rangers in 2002.\n\nGreer's aggressive style of play took a severe toll on his body, and he spent the remainder of his baseball career undergoing and recovering from surgeries. After first coming off of the disabled list in 2002, he was only able to play one more game, on July 11 of that year, before going back on the disabled list. On August 22, he had surgery to fuse the C5 and C6 vertebrae in his neck; and in the offseason, he had surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in his shoulder. He was then expected to miss the entire 2003 season. While rehabilitating from the rotator cuff surgery, he had to undergo Tommy John surgery and an ulnar nerve transposition in July 2003. He actually was also supposed to receive operations on his right hip and right knee, but he decided against those. He also had surgery in the following offseason to remove scar tissue that had built up in his elbow, and early in the 2004 season he had additional surgery to remove scar tissue from his shoulder.\n\nNevertheless, he was still determined to come back; and he and the Rangers expected to see him back on the field as a designated hitter during the last month of their season. He worked out at the Rangers' spring training facility in Surprise, Arizona, with the intention of doing a rehabilitation assignment in the minor leagues shortly thereafter. However, his workout was cut short; he returned to Texas, where he had surgery to remove scar tissue on his forearm and was declared out for the season. The Rangers, not surprisingly, decided to buy out the option year on his contract; he actually made almost as much money during the two lost seasons as he did in the rest of his career combined.\n\nGreer received invitations from the Rangers and the Minnesota Twins to go to spring training as a non-roster invitee, but he decided that he would rather retire than move his family to another state. Thus, on February 20, 2005, he announced his retirement, officially ending his comeback attempt.\n\nOn August 11, 2007, the Rangers inducted Greer into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the 1996, '98 and '99 American League Division Series, Greer batted only .111 (4-for-36). He played all three outfield positions and first base in his career. His fielding percentage was .980 at left field, .970 at right field, .981 at center field and .960 at first base.\n\nOn May 8, 2008, Rusty served as the honorary manager of Team Hardline in the KTCK SportsRadio 1310 The Ticket's Great Game in Frisco, Texas at the Dr Pepper Ballpark.\n\nToday, Greer resides in Colleyville, Texas and has three children.\n"}

{"id": "2070218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070218", "title": "Atlantic Coast Express", "text": "Atlantic Coast Express\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Express (ACE) is an express passenger train in England that has operated at various times between London and seaside resorts in the South West England. It is currently operated as a summer only service by Great Western Railway between London Paddington and Newquay.\n\nAfter completion of the lines to Bude in 1898 and Padstow in 1899, the London & South Western Railway (L&SWR) introduced the first \"North Cornwall Express\" in 1900 leaving London Waterloo at 11:10, and this continued over the next decade as the \"North Cornwall & Bude Express\" with the departure time adjusted to 11:00 running during the summer only. By 1914 this train was running throughout the year, and outside the summer season carried through coaches to Padstow, Bude, Plymouth and Ilfracombe, a presage of things to come. However World War I reduced both the scope for holidays and stretched the railways resources, and after this the L&SWR did not pursue a policy of having a premier named train on the route.\n\nThis was set to change as a result of the 1923 Railway Grouping Act which created four new companies to run Britain's railways, and the former London & South Western Railway became part of the new Southern Railway. The Great Western Railway (GWR), as the main competitor for services to Devon and Cornwall, had been left virtually unchanged by the railway company mergers, and the directors of the new Southern Railway recognised that some initiative was needed to publicise their services to the South West, and in addition show they were ready to compete with \"the old enemy\" once more; the GWR had coined the phrase \"Cornish Riviera\" and had been using this in its publicity for 20 years.\n\nJohn Elliot, a public relations assistant to the Southern Railway, proposed to the board in December 1924 that the next batch of express passenger locomotives be named after characters from Arthurian legend, and that a named train be introduced. The name was chosen as the result of a competition run in the staff magazine and the winning entry was submitted by Mr F. Rowland, a guard from Woking who won a prize of three guineas for suggesting \"Atlantic Coast Express\". He was soon to move to Great Torrington in North Devon; he was killed in a shunting accident there six years later. It made its inaugural run on 19 July 1926.\n\nFrom the beginning the \"ACE\" effectively had five destinations, three in Devon and two in Cornwall.\n\nPlymouth, by far the largest city in Devon, was served via Okehampton and Tavistock. The steep gradients and tortuous nature of the route beyond Exeter meant that it was not possible to compete with the Great Western Railway's \"Cornish Riviera Express\" in terms of speed, but it was a useful alternative route, particularly for passengers from the South and South East of England, who could make a connection at Salisbury and thus avoid travelling via London.\n\nHalwill Junction was the junction for the two Cornish destinations: Bude, a small but growing resort on the most northerly part of the Cornish coast; and Padstow, a fishing port at the mouth of the River Camel and the Southern Railway's most distant outpost almost 260 miles from Waterloo. At the junction, the Bude carriages were detached and the Padstow section turned south to Launceston, skirting the edge of Bodmin Moor before reaching Camelford. A swift descent to Wadebridge followed, through countryside described by Poet Laureate John Betjeman. The route was completed following the River Camel.\n\nThe North Devon portions of the \"ACE\" followed the route from Exeter Central through Crediton to Yeoford before turning north west and reaching the valley of the River Taw at Lapford. Thereafter the line hugged the river to Barnstaple Junction, the junction for the two North Devon destinations of the \"ACE\". From here the Torrington portion followed the estuary of the Taw westward to Instow before turning south along the River Torridge to Bideford and its destination of Great Torrington. The portion for Ilfracombe, another port that owes its status as a holiday destination to the coming of the railways, continued northwards. Started from Barnstaple Junction, the branch for Ilfracombe headed north through Barnstaple Town and on to Braunton before climbing steeply to Mortehoe and then descending more steeply to the terminus at Ilfracombe.\n\nAt various times Exmouth, Sidmouth, Seaton Junction and Lyme Regis had through coaches.\n\nThe heavy reliance on holiday passengers meant that the volume of traffic was very seasonal. On Summer Saturdays, the \"ACE\" consisted of up to five trains departing from Waterloo in the 40 minutes before 11:00, stretching resources on the long single-track branch lines to the limit. In the winter timetable, one train was sufficient for all of the branches, and stops were made at all but the most insignificant stations west of Exeter. Significant delays were frequent at the junctions, as coaches were detached or attached and shunted between the various sections of the train, belying the name of \"Express\".\nIn later years, a carriage was detached at Salisbury to join a following stopping train along the main line, and two carriages were detached at Sidmouth Junction, one for Sidmouth and one for Exmouth via Budleigh Salterton. The restaurant and buffet cars were normally removed during the major division at Exeter Central.\n\nSaturdays were always the busiest and in August 1939 the \"ACE\" was shown in Bradshaw's Guide as five separate trains departing from Waterloo; serving Ilfracombe (10:36), Padstow (10:40), Ilfracombe again (10:47), Bude (10:54) and a final departure at 11.00 with portions for Padstow, Bude and Plymouth.\n\nServices continued in much the same pattern until the outbreak of World War II, which necessitated longer trains and substantial deceleration on all lines, rendering named trains no longer appropriate.\n\nWith the end of hostilities the Southern Railway lost no time in reintroducing its most prestigious express. The company's locomotive design department, under its innovative Chief Mechanical Engineer, Oliver Bulleid, had been working during the war years; Bulleid's two new designs of express locomotive, the Merchant Navy class Pacifics for services between Waterloo and Exeter Central and the lighter West Country and Battle of Britain class for the branches beyond, enabled improvements in timekeeping and reliability and facilitated the introduction of heavier trains. Initially there was little increase in overall speeds owing to the poor state of the track, which had suffered neglect during the war.\n\nThe 1950s marked the highpoint of the \"ACE\", with the first mile-a-minute timing on the Southern Region (as the Southern Railway had become) with a 12:23 arrival in Salisbury, 83 miles from Waterloo. Gradual improvements in schedules continued until the final acceleration in autumn of 1961, when the journey time from Waterloo to Exeter Central came down to 2 hours 56 minutes.\n\nIn common with lines all over the country, the 1960s were a period of steady decline for services to the West Country as car ownership increased.\n\nIn 1963 control of all lines west of Salisbury was handed over to the Western Region – still the hated Great Western Railway to most of the Southern employees – and changes to the \"ACE\" followed swiftly. From June 1963 the Bude, Torrington and Plymouth through carriages were withdrawn except on summer Saturdays. The remaining services survived through the following summer until, on 5 September 1964 West Country locomotive 34023 \"Blackmoor Vale\" hauled the last \"ACE\" out of Padstow, and the last coaches of the \"Atlantic Coast Express\" arrived there from Waterloo behind N Class locomotive 31845.\nThe radical pruning of the railway system from 1966 by Dr Richard Beeching affected the West Country. Torrington lost its passenger services in 1965, the North Cornwall branches in 1966, the Plymouth line in 1968, and Barnstaple to Ilfracombe in 1970.\n\nIn 2008 First Great Western revived the name for a new summer only daily service from London Paddington to Newquay operated by High Speed Trains. As at May 2018, this departs London Paddington on Mondays to Fridays at 09:03 and Newquay at 15:06, and on Saturdays departs London Paddington at 11:35 and Newquay at 11:30.\n\nFirst Devon & Cornwall previously ran a regular bus service from Exeter to Bude, via Okehampton and Holsworthy (service X9), which was branded \"Atlantic Coast Express\", with this name appearing on the indicator board of the bus and also on bus stops. The bus had to make a diversion around the back streets of Holsworthy to avoid a low bridge – one of the surviving overbridges of the old railway route.\n\nThe Bluebell Railway operates some of its Mark 1 coaching stock with ACE roofboards. While there is no chance of reopening all the routes of the ACE, some significant sections may soon see the return of passengers. The Bodmin & Wenford Railway plans to extend 5 miles west from Boscarne Junction into Wadebridge in the future (although only the last mile of this will be over the route of the ACE). The Launceston Steam Railway wants to extend its short narrow-gauge line further west along the North Cornwall line as far as Egloskerry, and to provide winter services using a railmotor. \n\nThe course of the Barnstaple to Bideford route is retained, and there is an active campaign for reopening. The Exeter to Plymouth route beyond Okehampton via Tavistock has been considered for reopening, partly due to population growth in Tavistock, and partly because of coastal erosion of the South Devon Railway sea wall at Dawlish.\n\n"}
{"id": "2070219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070219", "title": "Subject-SUBJECT consciousness", "text": "Subject-SUBJECT consciousness\n\nSubject–SUBJECT consciousness is a concept articulated by Harry Hay, representing the valuable mindset in same-sex relationships, emerging from the inherent similarities of the partners.\n\nThe notion stands in contrast to the subject–object dynamic prevailing in heterosexual society, where men presume cultural dominance and see only themselves as \"subjects\" relative to women, who are in turn treated as \"objects\" or property. Hay extrapolated this interpersonal/sexual dynamic into a broader social context, believing that subject–object relationships were the root of society's ills. Objectification served as a barrier, emotionally separating an individual self from another individual by dehumanizing them.\n\nSame-sex relationships, however, suggest a different dynamic at work. Hay believed that gay relationships evolve from mutual respect and empathy for the other: a longing for a companion who is as equally valuable as the self, an interpersonal/sexual dynamic based on \"subject–SUBJECT\" consciousness. (Hay capitalized the second term for emphasis in all writings on the topic.) Hay believed that this subject–SUBJECT way of viewing the world is the most valuable contribution LGBT people bring to society at large: by empathizing with all people, relating to each other as equal-to-equal, society can change drastically, and social justice can prevail.\n\n\n"}

Four of the stores include ice cream parlors year-round, with one location offering ice cream seasonally.\n\nAlbert \"Mike\" Malley borrowed $500 in 1935, and opened his first candy store on Madison Avenue in Lakewood. The Malley family lived in the back of the building. Their efforts were successful, and by 1949, they opened a second store, also in Lakewood.\n\nIn 2010, Malley's moved its corporate headquarters from Cleveland back to Lakewood, Ohio, near where the company was founded in 1935. The reason for the move was to free up more retail space at the company's main plant, where the HQ had been since 1990. Malley’s manufacturing hub is a 60,000 square-foot factory in Cleveland, noted for three tall pink silos with the words \"Milk,\" \"Sugar,\" and \"Cocoa\" painted on them. The company’s signature confection, chocolate-covered strawberries, are prepared by a special 50-person crew around Valentine’s Day every year.\n\nIn October 2017, the company opened its 23rd retail outlet in Plain Township, OH, a suburb of Canton. This was Malley’s first venture into Stark County; its closest stores located in nearby Summit County.\n\nMalley's has been in business for over seven decades, and has been Cleveland's largest family owned and operated factory since 1935. It is currently a third generation company.\n\nThe Republican Party, holding its national convention in Cleveland in 2016, named Malley's Chocolates as one of 22 vendors to be included in the RNC \"Freedom Marketplace\" to be held at Progressive Field concurrent with the convention in adjacent Quicken Loans Arena. Malley's will offer their signature chocolates with a Cleveland theme.\n\nThird generation Malley's president, Dan Malley, is renowned for his unusual promotional events. He has persuaded Cleveland celebrities, such as Natalie Ronayne of the Cleveland Botanical Garden; Beth Mooney, CEO of KeyCorp; and celebrity chef Rocco Whelan to appear in his Malley's catalog wearing fuzzy bunny ears. It is an annual event Malley has also distributed 50,000 \"Choc\" Chocolate bumper stickers. If a driver is spotted by one of Malley's team, the driver gets $25 and a chance to win $500. Perhaps the most unusual promotion was when Malley persuaded 25 people to lease and drive pink Volkswagen beetles emblazoned with the Malley's and \"Choc\" logos. Malley pays the drivers $150/month and sets up the $300/month lease through a Cleveland car dealer.\n\n"}

Zappa also released a video titled \"The Amazing Mr. Bickford\", which was entirely composed of Bickford animations set to a soundtrack of Zappa's orchestral music.\n\nBickford was born in Seattle in 1947. He served with the U.S. Marines and fought during the Vietnam War. \n\nBickford's animations depict surreal scenes based on his unique worldview. Often outwardly seeming to be somewhat disconnected from the world around him, Bruce Bickford's work is extremely subjective in its content and concepts, making for some disturbing and shocking imagery. Much of his video work depicted fast-moving, fluid-like transformations of human figures and disfigured faces into odd beasts on surreal structural settings with impressive camera effects (moving around within his stop-motion animation).\n\nHis life and work were featured in the 2004 biographical documentary film \"Monster Road\", directed by Brett Ingram.\n\nIn 2006, he was working on \"Boar's Head/Whore's Bed\" (line animation, 4,500+ frames and counting), \"Tales of the Green River\" and \"Castle 2001\", a feature-length film which is animated using 3D shapes made out of bits of paper.\n\nIn 2008, \"Prometheus' Garden\" was released, a 28-minute short originally completed in 1988.

{"id": "2070239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070239", "title": "Shirehampton", "text": "Shirehampton\n\nShirehampton is a district of Bristol in England, near Avonmouth at the northwestern edge of the city.\n\nIt originated as a separate village, retains a High Street with a parish church and shops, and is still thought of as a village by many of its 6,867 inhabitants. Although on the far northwest corner, and largely separated from the rest of Bristol by a broad swathe of parkland extending from the Blaise Castle estate, with the River Avon forming a barrier for access to Somerset, the community is still a convenient location from which to reach all parts of the city and its work environment.\n\nTravel is also easy from Shirehampton into Gloucestershire, South Wales and Somerset since it lies within easy reach of all the main motorways in the area, including the M5, the M4 Second Severn Crossing, and the M49, and it is served by the A4 Portway and by Shirehampton railway station, which allow access to near the city centre. It is informally known to local people as \"Shire\".\n\nShirehampton looks across the Avon towards the rural Failand Hills of Somerset. For many centuries the only direct connection with Somerset was via a small rowed ferry which crossed from near The Lamplighters pub (\"The Lamps\") to the village of Pill, Somerset opposite. This state of affairs continued until the completion of the M5 Avonmouth Bridge in 1974. From the limestone ridge of Penpole Point (whose name meant approximately Land's End in the Celtic language spoken here before English), there used to be extensive and far-reaching views across the River Severn to the distant hills of South Wales, but tree growth has restricted this once spectacular prospect.\n\nThe gravel terraces above the River Avon provide some of the earliest evidence of human occupation in the British Isles. Here and around Ham Green and Pill, on the opposite bank of the Avon, humans with a Lower Palaeolithic (earliest phase of the Old Stone Age) culture (possibly of the hominid type \"Homo heidelbergensis\") left tools and debris behind at an uncertain time some 250–400,000 years ago. For comparison, the well-known Palaeolithic sites at Waverley Wood, Warwickshire, and Boxgrove Quarry, Sussex, have artefacts from about 500,000 years ago, and Boxgrove has yielded bones of \"H. heidelbergensis\".\n\nShirehampton was originally a detached part of the parish of Westbury-on-Trym, separated from the main part of Westbury by a part of Henbury parish, which included Kingsweston, the great house, King's Weston House whose inhabitants have had a considerable impact on Shirehampton as employers and benefactors. The area is on record as part of the estate of \"Stoke\", which was granted by King Offa of Mercia to the bishop of Worcester in about 795, along with the district that is now called Stoke Bishop, and there are two later Anglo-Saxon documents about the same pieces of land.\n\nThe place was originally called simply Hampton, meaning \"large farming estate\" or \"farm enclosed on several sides\", and later became known as \"sharny Hampton\", meaning \"dungy Hampton\". The name was \"cleaned up\" by the Elizabethans to its current form.\n\nThe village grew up around the lowest safe river crossing on the river Avon before it empties into the Severn. The ferry between the villages of Pill, Somerset, and Shirehampton, originally in Gloucestershire, connects a ridgeway along Kingsweston Hill (sometimes now called \"Abbot's Way\") with the hills beyond the Avon and continues on towards Clevedon. The ferry ran continuously until 1974, when it was superseded by the M5 bridge.\n\nA priory of the Benedictine abbey of St Mary, Cormeilles, in Normandy, is sometimes said to have been established at Shirehampton in the early Middle Ages, and the converted fifteenth-century tithe barn in the High Street is believed to have belonged to the monastic estate. However, the place referred to in Domesday Book is certain to have been Kyre in Worcestershire, and there is no real connection between Shirehampton and Cormeilles apart from the building stones exchanged by the two communities in 1963 on the strength of the supposed historical connection.\n\nThe development of Shirehampton throughout the eighteenth century is closely associated with the history of the adjacent King's Weston House and its extensive estate. Much of the surrounding area was in the ownership of the Southwell family, owners of King's Weston and later to receive the title of Baron de Clifford. Shirehampton prospered through tourism as sightseers from Bath, Clifton and Bristol's Hotwells came to view Kings Weston and the famous views from Penpole Point.\n\nShirehampton became ecclesiastically separate in 1844 when the chapel of ease of St Mary, dating from at least Elizabethan times, was raised to parish church status. The original chapel building, about which nothing is known, had been replaced in 1727 and this had been rebuilt in 1827. This Gothic-style building burnt down in 1928 and was replaced by the current church, designed by Percival Hartland Thomas, which has a distinctive electric carillon installed in 1959 with the aid of a benefaction from parishioner Mabel Creber.\n\nThere are three other churches in Shirehampton: Methodist, Baptist, and Roman Catholic.\n\nDuring World War I, Shirehampton was the location of a remount depot for horses. This was the largest such depot in the country, with a capacity of up to 5,000 horses. These horses were mostly supplied from the US and Shirehampton was conveniently close to the new Royal Edward Dock at Avonmouth where they were landed. After some weeks of training, horses would then pass to the depot at Swaythling, from where they passed to France. 347,045 horses and mules passed through Shirehampton in the course of the war. After the war much of the materiel from the remount depot was bought by local builder Robert Stride who used it to develop Severn Beach. Robert was the cousin of Jared and Jethro Stride who developed Sneyd Park.\n\nAvonmouth was a part of Shirehampton parish until 1917. It developed as the main element of the port of Bristol in the later nineteenth century, attracting many workers to settle there and in Shirehampton proper; it had grown so big by 1917 that it was given separate status, for both ecclesiastical and civil purposes. Shirehampton itself expanded considerably in the later nineteenth century, and was absorbed, with Avonmouth, by the city of Bristol in 1904. After World War I, the city built a great deal of decent social (\"council\") housing here, and this has largely determined the present character of the place.\n\nAlong the High Street there remains a fair sprinkling of the larger houses which typified the place before 1900, often (like Twyford House and The Wylands) converted to public or commercial use; some have been demolished and replaced by small infill estates (like Sunny Hill); some have been retained and surrounded by other houses (such as Penlea and the former vicarage partly retaining some of the supposed priory's construction); and some have gone altogether like the ancient house of sixteenth-century appearance, which has been lost to road widening and a row of 1960s shops.\n\nAs Shirehampton and Avonmouth grew, the squires of Kings Weston House, notably Philip Napier Miles (1865–1935), gave many benefactions to the district, including land for churches, war memorials and social amenities. Among these important gifts was the Public Hall of 1904, whose main claim to fame is perhaps that it was the venue of the first performance of Vaughan Williams's rhapsody \"The Lark Ascending\", in its original version for solo violin and piano, played by the violinst Marie Hall, a friend of Vaughan Williams from his visits to Kings Weston house, in 1920. Little Park (or Shirehampton Park) was given to the National Trust after World War I, and is used as a golf course.\n\nShirehampton is well provided with churches, schools, sporting facilities, shops and pubs. It has a number of public open spaces and antiquities nearby. These include Kingsweston Roman Villa (whose ruins are visible by the roadside in the modern suburb of Lawrence Weston), Blaise Castle Estate, and Blaise Castle House Museum, in addition to Shirehampton Park. Shirehampton Football Club, based at Penpole Lane, in Shirehampton and play in the Somerset County League.\n\nOn the banks of the River Avon stands the Old Powder House. It was built in 1775-6 to store gunpowder, which was not allowed into Bristol docks. It is a grade II listed building. The village war memorial stands by Shirehampton Road north of the golf course, not far from the site of the now dry Rush Pool, a pool formerly used by drovers bringing cattle from Wales across the Severn to market in Bristol.\n\nShirehampton, in particular the woodland overlooking Horseshoe Bend in the Avon (a National Nature Reserve), is well known as being the main location for certain rare plant species including the true service tree \"(Sorbus domestica)\" and two other whitebeams, \"Sorbus eminens\" and \"Sorbus anglica.\" The nationally scarce large-leaved lime \"(Tilia platyphyllos)\" also occurs, as it does elsewhere in the Severn basin, and rare herbaceous plants include field garlic \"(Allium oleraceum)\" and pale St. John's-wort \"(Hypericum montanum).\" The narrow saltmarsh below the wood contains two nationally scarce vascular plant species, slender hare's-ear \"(Bupleurum tenuissimum)\" and long-stalked orache \"(Atriplex longipes).\"\n\nThe Lamplighters Marsh Site of Nature Conservation Interest is also within the boundaries of Shirehampton.\n\n\nThe novelist Evelyn Waugh (1903–66) is known to have visited both Shirehampton, where his mother had lived, and Kingsweston House in the 1950s, whilst researching his autobiography, but his memory seems to have been confused. He wrote of his visit in a postcard to a friend, Francis Beaufort Palmer. Waugh's mother lived at Priory House, 61 Pembroke Road. In his book \"A Little Learning\", Waugh writes:\n\nIn less than ten years from the book's publication in 1964, Priory House and the new vicarage had been demolished, but The Priory is still there.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s a Dalek sat outside the Haven Master's building on the banks of the river Avon, just across from the Lamplighters public house. The Dalek used to face up river, so that boats coming from Bristol Docks to the Severn and Bristol Channel (not to mention the Pill Ferry) would have to pass under its nozzle. The Dalek was used to raise funds during at least one Shirehampton Carnival in (probably) the very late 1960s. For 6d, children could sit inside on the plain wooden slat and twiddle the nozzle for a few minutes apiece.\n\nBoth the Dalek and the Pill Ferry (as well as 'The Cockle Lady', who used to sell cockles in the High Street during the 1960s) are featured in the not-quite-children's book, \"Tabitha Miggins: Ship's Cat (on the Pill Ferry)\", by Shirehampton author, Mark Jones (writing as Philippa Perry). Note that the photograph on the rear jacket of the follow-up book, \"Further Adventures of Tabitha Miggins, Ship's Cat on the Pill Ferry\" (this time attributed to Mark Clinton Jones), shows a painted-out direction post in Pill that points the way to the \"Shirehampton Ferry\". This is a bit of a misnomer because it was known as 'the Pill ferry' on both sides of the river.\n\n\n\n"}

One of the more persistent sources of disputes was largely resolved with an agreement signed in 1999, which stabilized CHSR's largest source of funding: undergraduate students at the University of New Brunswick. The new agreement requires a signed petition and a referendum to change or remove the media fee, whereas previously funding could be (and once was) removed by a simple motion of Student Union Council.\n\nAs a community radio station housed on a university campus, CHSR makes an extra effort to reach out to the off-campus community, playing local content and providing on-site training for new DJs who later are able to host their own show.\n\nA founding member of the national community broadcasters collective, the National Campus and Community Radio Association, CHSR remains an active member of the alternative media, including participation in the NCRA's Dig Your Roots project.
