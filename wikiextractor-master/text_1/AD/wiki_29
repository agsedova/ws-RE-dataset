It is one of 87 mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first past the post method of voting.\n\nThe electoral district was created in the 1993 boundary redistribution from the old Grande Prairie electoral district and significantly modified in the 2017 redistribution.\n\nThe district and its antecedent have been a stronghold for conservative candidates in recent decades. The representative for this district is United Conservative Wayne Drysdale. He won election for the first time in 2008. To date there have been three representatives who have held the district.\n\nThe riding takes its name from the City of Grande Prairie and the Wapiti River.\n\nWhile a predominantly rural riding, Grande Prairie-Wapiti includes a few neighbourhoods on the east side of the City of Grande Prairie (including Cobblestone, Countryside, Crystal Heights, Crystal Landing, Hillside, Ivy Lake, and Smith). Four small towns are also located in the riding - Beaverlodge, Hythe, Sexsmith, and Wembley. The bulk of the riding's area is made up of rural municipalities, including almost all of the County of Grande Prairie No. 1 and a portion of the Municipal District of Greenview No. 16.\n\nThe riding's Indigenous community includes the Horse Lake First Nation and the Wanyandie Flats East settlement of the unrecognized Aseniwuche Winewak Nation.\n\nGrande Prairie-Wapiti surrounds the riding of Grande Prairie and borders Central Peace-Notley to the north and east and West Yellowhead to the south. The riding's western boundary is the Alberta-British Columbia border.\n\nThe electoral district was created in the 1993 boundary redistribution from the old Grande Prairie electoral district. It remained mostly unchanged in the 1997 and 2003 re-distributions. The Boundaries Commission proposed to abolish the district to create a completely urban Grande Prairie district but it changed its decision under public pressure. The 2010 distribution made minor changes to the border with Grande Prairie-Smoky in the city of Grande Prairie but stayed the same in the rural areas.\n\nThe electoral district was created in the 1993 boundary redistribution from the old Grande Prairie district. The first representative elected in 1993 was Progressive Conservative candidate Wayne Jaques. He won a hotly contested race over Liberal candidate Dwight Logan to pick up the new district for his party. Jaques was re-elected in the 1997 election with a much larger margin. He retired from provincial politics in 2001.\n\nThe second representative was Progressive Conservative was Gordon Graydon who won his first term in office in 2001 with a landslide over a field of five other candidates. He won a second term in the 2004 general election winning over half the popular vote. After the 2004 election Premier Ralph Klein appointed Graydon Minister of Gaming. He held that post until 2006. Graydon retired from provincial politics in 2008.\n\nThe third representative is current Progressive Conservative MLA is Wayne Drysdale who was elected in the 2008 election for the first time.\n\n\"Voters had the option of selecting 4 Candidates on the Ballot\"\n\nOn November 19, 2004 a Student Vote was conducted at participating Alberta schools to parallel the 2004 Alberta general election results. The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. The vote was conducted in 80 of the 83 provincial electoral districts with students voting for actual election candidates. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located.\n"}

The athletics program traces its earliest roots to events used in the ancient Greek Olympics. The modern program includes track and field events, road running events, and racewalking events. Cross country running was also on the program in earlier editions but it was dropped after the 1924 Summer Olympics. \n\nThe events contested have varied widely. From 1900 to 1920, tug of war was considered to be part of the Olympic athletics programme, although the sports of tug of war and athletics are now considered distinct.\n\nNo new events have been added to the men's athletics programme since the 1952 addition of the short racewalk. The roster of events has not changed since then, with the exception of the omission of the long racewalk in 1976 (the IAAF held a 50 km walk World Championships that year instead and as a result the event was restored in 1980). The long racewalk is the only event currently held for men but not included on the women's programme, with the exception of women taking part in the heptathlon rather than the decathlon and the 100 metres hurdles rather than the 110 metres hurdles. The last women's event added to the roster was the 3000 metres steeplechase in 2008.\n\nA total of 52 different events have been held in the men's competition. The current list comprises 24 events.

{"id": "2221526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221526", "title": "Depiction", "text": "Depiction\n\nDepiction is reference conveyed through pictures. Basically a picture refers to its object through a non-linguistic two-dimensional scheme. A picture is not writing or notation. A depictive two-dimensional scheme is called a picture plane and may be constructed according to descriptive geometry where they are usually divided between \"projections\" (orthogonal and various oblique angles) and \"perspectives\" (according to number of vanishing points). Pictures are made with various materials and techniques, such as painting, drawing, or prints (including photography and movies) mosaics, tapestries, stained glass, and collages of unusual and disparate elements. Occasionally, picture-like features may be recognised in simple inkblots, accidental stains, peculiar clouds or a glimpse of the moon, but these are special cases, and it is controversial whether they count as genuine instances of depiction. Similarly, sculpture and theatrical performances are sometimes said to depict, but this requires a broad understanding of 'depict', as simply designating a form of representation that is not linguistic or notational. The bulk of studies of depiction however deal only with pictures. While sculpture and performance clearly represent or refer, they do not strictly picture their objects. \nObjects pictured may be factual or fictional, literal or metaphorical, realistic or idealised and in various combination. Idealised depiction is also termed schematic or stylised and extends to icons, diagrams and maps. Classes or styles of picture may abstract their objects by degrees, conversely, establish degrees of the concrete (usually called, a little confusingly, figuration or figurative, since the 'figurative' is then often quite literal). Stylisation can lead to the fully abstract picture, where reference is only to conditions for a picture plane – a severe exercise in self-reference and ultimately a sub-set of pattern.\n\nBut just \"how\" pictures function remains controversial. Philosophers, art historians and critics, perceptual psychologists and other researchers in the arts and social sciences have contributed to the debate and many of the most influential contributions have been interdisciplinary. Some key positions are briefly surveyed below.\n\nTraditionally, depiction is distinguished from denotative meaning by the presence of a mimetic element or resemblance. A picture resembles its object in a way a word or sound does not. Resemblance is no guarantee of depiction, obviously. Two pens may resemble one another but do not therefore depict each other. To say a picture resembles its object especially is only to say that its object is that which it especially resembles; which strictly begins with the picture itself. Indeed, since everything resembles something in some way, mere resemblance as a distinguishing trait is trivial. Moreover, depiction is no guarantee of resemblance to an object. A picture of a dragon does not resemble an actual dragon. So resemblance is not enough.\n\nTheories have tried either to set further conditions to the kind of resemblance necessary, or sought ways in which a notational system might allow such resemblance. It is widely believed that the problem with a resemblance theory of depiction is that resemblance is a symmetrical relation between terms (necessarily, if x resembles y, then y resembles x) while in contrast depiction is at best a non-symmetrical relation (it is not necessary that, if x depicts y, y depicts x). If this is right, then depiction and resemblance cannot be identified, and a resemblance theory of depiction is forced to offer a more complicated explanation, for example by relying on experienced resemblance instead, which clearly is an asymmetrical notion (that you experience x as resembling y does not mean you also experience y as resembling x). Others have argued, however, that the concept of resemblance is not exclusively a relational notion, and so that the initial problem is merely apparent.\n\nIn art history, the history of actual attempts to achieve resemblance in depictions is usually covered under the terms \"realism\", naturalism\", or \"illusionism\".\n\nThe most famous and elaborate case for resemblance modified by reference, is made by art historian Ernst Gombrich. Resemblance in pictures is taken to involve illusion. Instincts in visual perception are said to be triggered or alerted by pictures, even when we are rarely deceived. The eye supposedly cannot resist finding resemblances that accord with illusion. Resemblance is thus narrowed to something like the seeds of illusion. Against the one-way relation of reference Gombrich argues for a weaker or labile relation, inherited from substitution. Pictures are thus both more primitive and powerful than stricter reference.\n\nBut whether a picture can deceive a little while it represents as much seems gravely compromised. Claims for innate dispositions in sight are also contested. Gombrich appeals to an array of psychological research from James J. Gibson, R. L. Gregory, John M. Kennedy, Konrad Lorenz, Ulric Neisser and others in arguing for an 'optical' basis to perspective, in particular (see also perspective (graphical). Subsequent cross-cultural studies in depictive competence and related studies in child-development and vision impairment are inconclusive at best.\n\nGombrich's convictions have important implications for his popular history of art, for treatment and priorities there. In a later study by John Willats (1997) on the variety and development of picture planes, Gombrich's views on the greater realism of perspective underpin many crucial findings.\n\nA more frankly behaviouristic view is taken by the perceptual psychologist James J. Gibson, partly in response to Gombrich. Gibson treats visual perception as the eye registering necessary information for behaviour in a given environment. The information is filtered from light rays that meet the retina. The light is called the stimulus energy or sensation. The information consists of underlying patterns or 'invariants' for vital features to the environment.\n\nGibson's view of depiction concerns the re-presentation of these invariants. In the case of illusions or trompe l'oeil, the picture also conveys the stimulus energy, but generally the experience is of perceiving two sets of invariants, one for the picture surface, another for the object pictured. He pointedly rejects any seeds of illusion or substitution and allows that a picture represents when two sets of invariants are displayed. But invariants tell us little more than that the resemblance is visible, dual invariants only that the terms of reference are the same as those for resemblance\n\nA similar duality is proposed by the philosopher of art Richard Wollheim. He calls it 'twofoldness'. Our experience of the picture surface is called the 'configurational' aspect, and our experience of the object depicted the 'recognitional'. Wollheim's main claim is that we are simultaneously aware of both the surface and the depicted object. The concept of twofoldness has been very influential in contemporary analytic aesthetics, especially in the writings of Dominic Lopes and of Bence Nanay. Again, illusion is forestalled by the prominence of the picture surface where an object is depicted. Yet the object depicted quite simply \"is\" the picture surface under one reading, the surface indifferent to picture, another. The two are hardly compatible or simultaneous. Nor do they ensure a reference relation.\n\nWollheim introduces the concept of 'seeing-in' to qualify depictive resemblance. Seeing-in is a psychological disposition to detect a resemblance between certain surfaces, such as inkblots or accidental stains, etc. and three-dimensional objects. The eye is not deceived, but finds or projects some resemblance to the surface. This is not quite depiction, since the resemblance is only incidental to the surface. The surface does not strictly refer to such objects. Seeing-in is a necessary condition to depiction, and sufficient when in accordance with the maker's intentions, where these are clear from certain features to a picture. But seeing-in cannot really say in what way such surfaces resemble objects either, only specify where they perhaps first occur.\n\nWollheim's account of how a resemblance is agreed or modified, whereby maker and user anticipate each other's roles, does not really explain how a resemblance refers, but rather when an agreed resemblance obtains.\n\nThe appeal to broader psychological factors in qualifying depictive resemblance is echoed in the theories of philosophers such as Robert Hopkins, Flint Schier and Kendall Walton. They enlist 'experience', 'recognition' and 'imagination' respectively. Each provides additional factors to an understanding or interpretation of pictorial reference, although none can explain how a picture resembles an object (if indeed it does), nor how this resemblance is then also a reference.\n\nFor example, Schier returns to the contrast with language to try to identify a crucial difference in depictive competence. Understanding a pictorial style does not depend upon learning a vocabulary and syntax. Once grasped, a style allows the recognition of any object known to the user. Of course recognition allows a great deal more than that – books teaching children to read often introduce them to many exotic creatures such as a kangaroo or armadillo through illustrations. Many fictions and caricatures are promptly recognised without prior acquaintance of either a particular style or the object in question. So competence cannot rely on a simple index or synonymy for objects and styles.\n\nSchier's conclusion that lack of syntax and semantics in reference then qualifies as depiction, leaves dance, architecture, animation, sculpture and music all sharing the same mode of reference. This perhaps points as much to limitations in a linguistic model.\n\nReversing orthodoxy, the philosopher Nelson Goodman starts from reference and attempts to assimilate resemblance. He denies resemblance as either necessary or sufficient condition for depiction but surprisingly, allows that it arises and fluctuates as a matter of usage or familiarity.\n\nFor Goodman, a picture denotes. Denotation is divided between description, covering writing and extending to more discursive notation including music and dance scores, to depiction at greatest remove. However, a word does not grow to resemble its object, no matter how familiar or preferred. To explain how a pictorial notation does, Goodman proposes an analogue system, consisting of undifferentiated characters, a density of syntax and semantics and relative repleteness of syntax. These requirements taken in combination mean that a one-way reference running from picture to object encounters a problem. If its semantics is undifferentiated, then the relation flows back from object to picture. Depiction can acquire resemblance but must surrender reference. This is a point tacitly acknowledged by Goodman, conceding firstly that density is the antithesis of notation and later that lack of differentiation may actually permit resemblance. A denotation without notation lacks sense.\n\nNevertheless, Goodman's framework is revisited by philosopher John Kulvicki and applied by art historian James Elkins to an array of hybrid artefacts, combining picture, pattern and notation.\n\nPictorial semiotics aims for just the kind of integration of depiction with notation undertaken by Goodman, but fails to identify his requirements for syntax and semantics. It seeks to apply the model of structural linguistics, to reveal core meanings and permutations for pictures of all kinds, but stalls in identifying constituent elements of reference, or as semioticians prefer, 'signification'. Similarly, they accept resemblance although call it 'iconicity' (after Charles Sanders Peirce, 1931–58) and are uncomfortable in qualifying its role. Older practitioners, such as Roland Barthes and Umberto Eco variously shift analysis to underlying 'connotations' for an object depicted or concentrate on description of purported content at the expense of more medium-specific meaning. Essentially they establish a more general iconography.\n\nA later adherent, Göran Sonesson, rejects Goodman's terms for syntax and semantics as alien to linguistics, no more than an ideal and turns instead to the findings of perceptual psychologists, such as J. M. Kennedy, N. H. Freeman and David Marr in order to detect underlying structure. Sonesson accepts 'seeing-in', although prefers Edmund Husserl's version. Resemblance is again grounded in optics or the visible, although this does not exclude writing nor reconcile resemblance with reference. Discussion tends to be restricted to the function of outlines in schemes for depth.\n\nThe art historian Norman Bryson persists with a linguistic model and advances a detail of parsing and tense, 'deixis'. He rejects resemblance and illusion as incompatible with the ambiguities and interpretation available to pictures and is also critical of the inflexible nature of structuralist analysis. Deixis is taken as the rhetoric of the narrator, indicating the presence of the speaker in a discourse, a bodily or physical aspect as well as an explicit temporal dimension. In depiction this translates as a difference between 'The Gaze' where deixis is absent and 'The Glance' where it is present. Where present, details to materials indicate how long and in what way the depiction was made, where absent, a telling suppression or prolonging of the act. The distinction attempts to account for the 'plastic' or medium-specific qualities absent from earlier semiotic analyses and somewhat approximates the 'indexic' aspect to signs introduced by Peirce.\n\nDeixis offers a more elaborate account of the picture surface and broad differences to expression and application but cannot qualify resemblance.\n\nLastly, iconography is the study of pictorial content, mainly in art, and would seem to ignore the question of how to concentrate upon what. But iconography's findings take a rather recondite view of content, are often based on subtle literary, historical and cultural allusion and highlight a sharp difference in terms of resemblance, optical accuracy or intuitive illusion. Resemblance is hardly direct or spontaneous for the iconographer, reference rarely to the literal or singular. Visual perception here is subject to reflection and research, the object as much reference as referent.\n\nThe distinguished art historian Erwin Panofsky allowed three levels to iconography. The first is 'natural' content, the object recognised or resembling without context, on a second level, a modifying historical and cultural context and at a third, deeper level, a fundamental structure or ideology (called iconology). He even ascribed the use of perspective a deep social meaning (1927). However more recently, a natural or neutral level tends to be abandoned as mythical. The cultural scholar W. J. T. Mitchell looks to ideology to determine resemblance and depiction as acknowledgement of shifts in relations there, albeit by an unspecified scheme or notation.\n\nIconography points to differences in scope for a theory of depiction. Where stylistics and a basic object is nominated, resemblance is prominent, but where more elaborate objects are encountered, or terms for nature denied, simple perception or notation flounder. The difference corresponds somewhat to the division in philosophy between the analytic and continental.\n\nDozens of factors influence depictions and how they are represented. These include the equipment used to create the depiction, the creator’s intent, vantage point, mobility, proximity, publication format, among others, and, when dealing with human subjects, their potential desire for impression management.\n\nOther debates about the nature of depiction include the relationship between seeing something in a picture and seeing face to face, whether depictive representation is conventional, how understanding novel depictions is possible, the aesthetic and ethical value of depiction and the nature of realism in pictorial art.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The organization seeks to influence public opinion and legislation in favor of coal-generated electricity in the United States, placing emphasis on the development and deployment of clean coal technologies.\n\nSince carbon capture and sequestration—which ACCCE and its member companies advocate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal burning—has yet to be tested on a large scale, some have questioned whether this approach is feasible or realistic.\n\nIn 2009, ACCCE faced a Congressional investigation when it was discovered that a lobbying firm hired by ACCCE had sent forged letters to lawmakers. The letters, purporting to come from a variety of minority-focused non-profit groups, were in fact forged by a lobbying firm hired by ACCCE.\n\nThe ACCCE began operations in 2008, the result of a combination of two organizations: the Center for Energy and Economic Development (CEED) and Americans for Balanced Energy Choices (ABEC). CEED had been founded in 1992 and since then had been involved in a wide range of climate and energy policies related to coal-based electricity. ABEC, formed in 2000, had focused on consumer based advocacy programs concerning the use of coal-based electricity. In 2008 these two groups were combined to form ACCCE, with the goal of focusing on both legislative and public advocacy efforts. The main programs include the America's Power campaign, launched in 2007 by ABEC, which had a significant presence during the 2008 and 2012 elections, as well as legislative efforts during the United States House of Representatives debate over the Waxman-Markey cap and trade legislation.\n\nMike Duncan became President and CEO of ACCCE in 2012. By 2017, Duncan had been succeeded in that position by Paul Bailey, who had previously been named one of the top lobbyists by \"The Hill\", where he was described as ACCCE's \"point man for policy... essential in crafting the ACCCE's response\" to the positions taken by the Obama administration. Another notable ACCCE lobbyist, Jaime Harrison, was a Democratic political operative, who worked on behalf of ACCCE from 2009 to 2012. Harrison thereafter chaired the South Carolina Democratic Party, and in January 2017 made a bid for DNC chair, which he ended on February 23 with his endorsement of eventual winner Tom Perez. Harrison later accepted an appointment from Perez as Associate Chairman and Counselor of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIn June 2017, Paul Bailey joined Republican leaders including Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell in welcoming the announcement by President Donald Trump of the United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Bailey stated that \"[t]he previous administration volunteered to meet one of the most stringent goals of any country in the world, while many other countries do far less to reduce their emissions\", and contended that \"[m]eeting President Obama's goal would have led to more regulations, higher energy prices, and dependence on less reliable energy sources\". The organization maintains headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn addressing comprehensive climate change legislation that would place a cap on greenhouse gas emissions and allow for trading of emission allowances, the position of ACCCE has primarily involved advocating for the development and use of clean coal technologies, while also including provisions concerning the allocating of carbon emission allowances. ACCCE has as also expressed support for a ceiling on emission allowances prices. At the time in 2008 when the U.S. Senate was considering the Lieberman-Warner bill (bill number ) – which would create a cap and trade system – ACCCE changed its prior stance towards climate-change legislation, noting that it \"would support mandatory limits on carbon dioxide as long as legislation met a set of principles that encouraged 'robust utilization of coal.'\"\n\nThe group also employed legislative efforts surrounding the 2009 debate over the Waxman-Markey cap and trade legislation (bill number ), to which it argued that regulations relating to carbon emissions in the proposed legislation would have led to increased energy costs and reduction in employment – potentially placing additional strain on the economy during the late 2000s recession. ACCCE provided proposals to Members of Congress for changes in this legislation, and approved of some changes that were adopted; though the group did not support the final version of the bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives on account of concerns that there were not enough measures taken to control energy rates.\n\nIn addition to legislative methods employed by ACCCE, the organization has engaged in consumer-focused advocacy efforts in response to perceived environmental effects surrounding clean coal, consisting of direct to consumer advertising, as well as a group of approximately 225,000 volunteers (referred to as \"America's Power Army,\" according to their website) involved in \"visiting town hall meetings, fairs and other functions attended by members of Congress (to) ask questions about energy policy.\"\n\nInitiatives of this form became the subject of news coverage surrounding the 2008 United States presidential election, as the organization's presence at the Democratic National Convention, Republican National Convention, presidential debates and other events has been described as having impacted both Senators John McCain and Barack Obama's positions in regards to investment in clean coal. In the last debate held prior to the election in 2008, Senator Obama noted his support of clean coal technology, when prompted by Senator McCain to explain a time in which he had backed a position not favored by the leaders of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe organization actively countered President Obama's climate change agenda, arguing in 2013 that the industry had \"made strides toward making coal more environmentally friendly\", with ten new clean-coal technology plants having built between 2011 and mid-2013, and five more in development or scheduled to begin operations at that time. Duncan asserted that regulations propounded by the Environmental Protection Agency had contributed to nearly 290 coal plant closures that year, with more likely to come if additional regulations were enacted, and that absent the additional burdens imposed on the industry by such interference, the coal industry would continue developing cleaner technologies. ACCCE supported the FutureGen capture and sequestration project, first announced by President George W. Bush in 2003. The project was funded in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, but the Department of Energy suspended the project in February, 2015.\n\nACCCE's legislative positions and advocacy-based actions have been met with opposing viewpoints from advocacy groups such as the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, which have questioned the viability of developing environmentally sustainable clean coal within an adequate time frame and budget – representing their perspective that funding of such projects should be sourced exclusively from within the coal industry.\n\nSince 2009 the Coalition has - according to \"The Atlantic\" - \"pushed outright denial of climate science\". For example in a 2014 report it said that human-caused climate change was a \"hypothesis\" and a \"debate\" and claimed that carbon pollution would be beneficial instead of negative and that its benefits could be up to 400 times as high as its costs. Higher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels would be a benefit and more carbon dioxide had no \"discernable influence\" on how much sea-level would rise.\n\nA 2009 article by Josh Harkinson of \"Mother Jones\" magazine said ACCCE was among the most prominent organizations in promoting climate disinformation, grouping it with entities including ExxonMobil, the American Petroleum Institute, The Heartland Institute, and the Institute for Energy Research, as \"members of the chorus claiming that global warming is a joke and that CO2 emissions are actually good for you\".\n\nDuring the 2009 debate over the Waxman/Markey bill, Bonner & Associates, a Washington, D.C. lobbying firm subcontracted by ACCCE though the Hawthorne Group to drum up \"grassroots support\" for this effort, sent a number of fraudulent letters to lawmakers on behalf of ACCCE. The letters were forged to appear to come from various minority-focused non-profit groups, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Association of University Women.\n\nWhen the forgery was exposed, and faced with a proposed Congressional investigation, ACCCE apologized to the community groups and to the members of Congress involved. ACCCE disavowed the tactic and blamed the forgeries on their subcontractor, who in turn blamed a temporary worker, acting alone. \"The Washington Post\" described the situation as a \"saga of modern Washington, in which an 'American coalition' [the ACCCE] claiming 200,000 supporters still relies on a subcontractor to gin up favorable letters.\"\n\nAn investigation of ACCCE by U.S. Representative Edward Markey, launched in response to the forgeries, disclosed an additional set of fraudulent letters sent to lawmakers to lobby against the environmental legislation. In response to the investigation, the ACCCE pledged to take \"all possible steps\" to verify the authenticity of letters sent by Bonner & Associates on its behalf, and stated that it was cooperating with Markey's investigation. The investigation concluded in October 2009 with Jack Bonner, chairman of Bonner & Associates, taking “full responsibility” for the forged letters. Bonner and Associates was never paid by ACCCE for their work on the legislation.\n\n, ACCCE is supported by 31 member organizations:\n\n\n"}

It is found in mountainous regions of southern and central Europe.\n\nMountain areas of Albania, Andorra, Austria, Great Britain, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Liechtenstein, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Yugoslavia (Serbia, Kosovo, Voivodina, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia). \n\nIt is Britain's only true alpine species of butterfly. The larva feeds on moor matgrass near bogs and springs and the nectar-feeding adult visits bilberry, tormentil and heath bedstraw.\n\nThe pale cream eggs are laid singly, each female laying up to 70. The egg stage lasts two or three weeks.\n\nThe larva is green with a double dorsal and a single lateral white or yellowish line. The third instar larvae hibernate in grass tussocks. They emerge in the spring and recommence feeding. Some larvae spend two years in this stage, the result of a late spring and short summer restricting growth. Recorded larval food plants are \"Aira praecox\" (Czechoslovakia, Spain), \"Deschampsia cespitosa\" (Czechoslovakia), \"Festuca ovina\" (Spain), \"Nardus stricta\" (British Isles) and \"Poa annua\" (Spain)\n\nThe pupa is formed deep in grass tussocks, encased within a loose silk structure. The pupa stage lasts about three weeks.\n\nThe flight period is extremely short, a few weeks only, June to August depending on altitude.\n\nDescription in South (1906).\n\nWingspan . \"The typical form of this butterfly, \"epiphron\", Knock, has the tawny bands unbroken on the fore wings, and almost so on the hind wings; the black dots on the hind wings of the female are often pupilled with white, and more rarely this is so in the male also. It has been stated that specimens occur in Perthshire which exhibit these characters. All the British examples of the small mountain ringlet that I have seen are referable to the form known as \"cassiope\", Fab. (Plate 77). The tawny, or orange, bands are rarely so entire on the fore wings as in \"epiphron\", and are generally rather narrower; and that on the hind wing is broken up into three or four rings. The black dots are usually smaller and without white pupils. The female is somewhat larger and the bands or rings paler. Variation in the markings is extensive. The bands on the fore wings become less and less complete, until they are reduced to a series of mere rings around the black dots.

The show, which asked couples questions about their personal lives, aired in syndication during the 1969-1970 season, and was taped at NBC Studios in New York City.\n\nThe show was produced by Goodson-Todman Productions for primary sponsor Holiday Inn (American Home Products, the makers of over-the-counter drugs such as Dristan and Anacin, also sponsored). Johnny Olson and Bill Wendell announced.\n\nThe show had two formats during its run; one in which four celebrity couples (one or both of the members being a celebrity) competed, and one which had a single celebrity couple and three civilian couples.\n\nThe format was modified and brought back on CBS in 1974 as \"Tattletales\", with Bert Convy as host.\n\nEach team was given 100 points to begin the game (later they began with nothing). One member of each team (the men for the first half of the show, the women during the second half) were asked the questions, while the other member was taken to an off-stage room. Each could be seen and heard via a fake monitor that sat before each player using an electronic chroma key process; Garagiola communicated with them via an on-stage speaker phone.\n\nGaragiola read a statement (e.g., \"How he shows affection\"), and each contestant would have to raise his hand. The first three to raise their hands would say a one- or two-word answer, which Garagiola would ask them to explain. The answers would then be read one at a time over the phone, and the off-stage partner would have to ring in if she thought her partner had said it. If the first person to ring in was correct, the couple won 25 points. If she was wrong, the couple lost 10 points, as did the team which originally gave the answer. Each of the three answers would be read in random order. During the all-celebrity format, the off-stage partner would have to not only ring in for the correct answer, but also relate the same explanation or story about the answer as the on-stage partner to get the points; otherwise they lost 10 points.\n\nEach game consisted of four questions with the men and women switching positions halfway through the game. For the last question, only two people were allowed to raise their hands to answer.\n\nAt the end of the game, the team(s) with the most points won $250 and a full week's stay at any Holiday Inn. The remaining couples would each win a $100 gift certificate redeemable at any Holiday Inn. The celebrity couple played for a designated couple in the audience which was revealed at the end of the show. In the all-celebrity format, each celebrity couple played for a different couple in the audience.\n\nThe original pilot, titled \"It Had to Be You\", was originally produced for NBC with Ed McMahon as host and had all-civilian couples.\n\nAmong the episodes aired by GSN is the pilot for the 1969 series. The format features only one celebrity couple (Gene Rayburn and his wife Helen) playing against three civilian couples. The pilot exists as a black-and-white kinescope, although virtually all American television production had fully converted to color by this point.\n\nThe 1971 pilot of the same name used a similar format. Round 1 was the same as what made it to air, only using dollars instead of points and buzzers instead of raising their hands. The remaining teams were given $400, $200, and $100 depending on where they finished.\n\nIn Round 2, three questions were asked to each couple in the same manner as \"Tattletales\" – $50 each if all three matched, $100 if two matched, and $150 if only one matched.\n\nThe two highest scorers moved on to Round 3, in which each member of the team was out on stage. Each of the four players got half the bank to bid on a question. Host Garagiola presented a question to one member of each team of the same gender. They wrote their answer on a card and then their partner gave a bid and an answer. If they were correct, they won their bid; if wrong, they lost it. The two players switched roles and repeated the process.\n\nThe top scorer played the Big Match, a single question where each player wrote their answer on a card. If they matched, they drew from a hopper of balls with dollar amounts from $250 to $1,500 in $250 increments with two of each amount, for a possible total of $3,000.\n\nThe show was planned to be revived in Syndication for the Fall 2016 season, but no distribution plans we made.\n\nThe show's status is unknown. Relatively few episodes of the series have been aired by GSN, mostly featuring more well known guests (including Sally Field). This includes the pilot which has survived only as a black-and-white 16mm film that was originally videotaped in color.\n\nOn Valentine's Day 2016, Buzzr aired six episodes of the series as part of a marathon. The network also aired two episodes as part of the \"Buzzr Secret Vault\" on September 30, 2018.\n"}

He became particularly well known for his buildings and structures in Athens and Vienna, and is considered an outstanding representative of Neoclassicism and Historicism.\nAfter training with Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and some years studying in Vienna, he moved to Athens in 1837, where he studied architecture and design, with a concentration and interest in Byzantine architecture. During his stay in Athens, Hansen designed his first building, the National Observatory of Athens and two of the three contiguous buildings forming the so-called \"Athenian Trilogy\": the Academy of Athens and the National Library of Greece, the third building of the trilogy being the National and Capodistrian University of Athens, which was designed by his brother Hans Christian Hansen (1803–1883).\n\nThe Greek-Austrian entrepreneur Georgios Sinas (1783-1856, who donated the observatory, called Hansen to Vienna in 1846, where Hansen took up an apprenticeship with noted Austrian architect Ludwig Förster (1797–1863).\nIn his early works, such as the museum at The Arsenal in Vienna, Hansen was still rather aligned to a more romantic style. In later years, he became the most outstanding representative of Renaissance-inspired historicism (Neo-Renaissance), which also came to be known as Viennese-style. This style extended into the smallest details of the interior design and partially accepted the courses of a synthesis of the arts.\n\nAlong with Förster and many others, Hansen was one of the most important and influential architects of the Viennese Ringstraße. His most famous work is the Austrian Parliament building, which was created in the style of an ancient, neo-classic temple, and serves to refer to the Greek beginnings of democracy. Hansen was originally a staunch critic of the Classical style that was taught to him at the Copenhagen Academy. Over the years, however, he came to incorporate Classical elements into his forms. \"Bauleiter\" on this project was Swiss-Austrian architect Hans Auer (1847–1906) who would go on to win the competition for the Swiss Bundeshaus.\nHansen's famed Musikverein in Vienna is one of the most notable concert halls in the world; a concert hall whose design and acoustics are often admired and copied in present-day music houses.\nHansen worked together with Austrian sculptor Vincenz Pilz (1816-1896) and artist Carl Rahl (1812–1865), as well as with architect Otto Wagner (1841-1918).\nIn 1884 Emperor Franz Joseph honoured Hansen with a barony in the Austrian nobility and he was since styled \"Freiherr von Hansen\".\n\n\n"}

A CRO is an official of the company who has direct contact with the creditors and who has executive power to implement changes. The advantage of using a CRO is that the arrangement gives both the creditor and debtor more say over the future of the company than might be the case where a Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee is appointed.\n\n\n"}

It was enacted by the Constitution Amendment, 1993 (New Brunswick) and guarantees equality between English-speaking and French-speaking New Brunswickers.\n\nSection 16.1 (pronounced \"sixteen point one\") is not to be confused with subsection 16(1) (\"sixteen one\"), which is part of section 16 and goes back to 1982. Section 16.1 is a separate section; the \"point one\" numbering simply indicates that at some time (i.e. in 1993) an amendment inserted this new section between two existing sections without renumbering them.\n\nThe section reads,\n\nSection 16.1 makes reference to a need for \"institutions\" for both language groups, including educational institutions, and it seemingly gives the provincial government powers to protect the right. This is not completely revolutionary in that this merely entrenches laws already found in \"An Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswick\" (1981), as noted in the 2001 Court of Appeal case \"Charlebois v. Mowat\". The section can be seen as providing \"collective rights,\" and one critic charged that a deeper meaning to the section would have to be decided by Canadian courts.\n\nIn \"Charlebois v. Mowat\", the court ruled that section 16.1, as well as subsections 16(2) and 18(2), require bilingual municipal laws when the minority language population of a municipality is significant. The ruling was made primarily on the basis of the court's interpretation of subsection 18(2)), but in its ruling the court also stated that section 16.1 is \"remedial\", meaning that it is supposed to fix historical problems. (A related case later went to the Supreme Court as \"Charlebois v. Saint John (City)\".)\n\n\"An Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswick\" was enacted in 1981 by Premier Richard Hatfield. It provided independent school boards for both linguistic groups. Its principles were later incorporated into the Constitution of Canada, through section 16.1, in response to a shift in provincial politics in the early 1990s.\n\nWhereas in the 1980s all parties had supported the rise of bilingualism in New Brunswick, in 1991 a new party called the Confederation of Regions Party, which was opposed to official bilingualism, became the official opposition in the legislature. The pro-bilingualism Liberal provincial government proceeded to seek a constitutional amendment mandating bilingualism in New Brunswick to make any future change in New Brunswick's status subject to Federal approval.\n\nThe constitutionalization of the legislation was originally meant to be accomplished as part of a package of amendments known as the Charlottetown Accord in 1992. The amendment was made separately once the Accord was rejected in a national referendum, prompting Professor Peter Russell to refer to this as an \"encouraging [sign] that Canadians may be recovering the capacity to accomplish constitutional reform without linking everything together and getting bogged down in the mega constitutional swamp.\"\n\nSection 43 of the \"Constitution Act, 1982\" was the part of the amending formula used to add section 16.1 to the \"Charter\". This meant the amendment was approved by the province affected (New Brunswick) and the Senate of Canada and House of Commons of Canada, although constitutional lawyer Deborah Coyne argued that the amendment involved federal jurisdiction and thus seven provinces would be needed. The House of Commons passed the amendment with a vote of 219-2, on February 1, 1993.\n\nA \"Montreal Gazette\" article approved, calling the New Brunswick government \"courageous\" because of its resistance to the Confederation of Regions Party, and added that the section provided a \"noble, generous vision of Canadian duality and co-existence. Too bad it seems confined to New Brunswick.\"\n\nIt did attract some criticism, with columnist William Johnson claiming that Parliament had not fully analyzed the amendment and tried to stifle public discussion. He even suggested that section 16.1 might create two governments for New Brunswick, one in English and one in French. Earlier, this columnist had also charged that enshrining collective rights in the Constitution was \"alien to liberalism,\" and would undermine the individual in favour of a larger group; he also said section 16.1 excluded Aboriginal peoples in New Brunswick and could make them \"second-class citizens.\" He compared section 16.1 to how the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord would have recognized Quebec as a distinct society.\n\nHowever, Opposition leader Jean Chrétien, who at that time represented Acadians, said that \"For me it is a great day. It is an example that we can be together and at the same time be different in Canada.\"\n\nThe \"Constitution Amendment, 1993 (New Brunswick)\" was signed by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Attorney General Pierre Blais, and Registrar General Pierre H. Vincent, under a proclamation of Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn in Ottawa on 12 March 1993.\n\nIn 2000, an Ontario court ruled that the province was legally obligated to keep from closing the Montfort Hospital as part of its program of merging many of the hospitals in the Ottawa region. The basis for the decision was the court's conclusion that this was a logical application of an unwritten constitutional principle of minority rights, which had been found by the Supreme Court in the 1998 \"Reference re Secession of Quebec\". Since the Montfort Hospital was the only hospital in the region operating primarily in French, it amounted to a protected parallel service-provider, much as New Brunswick's French-language and English-language school systems are parallel service providers, and therefore as an essential component of the collective rights of Ottawa's Franco-Ontarian population. The Government of Ontario criticized the decision as judicial activism, and charged that \"The divisional court decision has effectively rewritten the constitution to make [Section] 16.1 applicable to Ontario despite the express intention that it apply to New Brunswick alone.\"\n\n"}

Designed by the Pei Cobb Freed & Partners architectural firm, the tower consists of two separate structures: A 10-story parking garage owned by the city and the 47-story office tower built upon the air rights of the garage. Preliminary planning for the tower began in February 1980; construction on the garage began by November. The garage was completed in February 1983 and the tower began construction a year later. On August 1984, while the tower was under construction, a 5-alarm fire began on the ninth floor; construction was subsequently delayed for several weeks. On December 15, 1985, the tower was lit for the first time in Miami Dolphins aqua and snowflakes.\n\nBy mid-1986, the tower's exterior was complete and the grand opening for the complex was set for early fall that same year. Due to the uneven settling of the tower's foundation to one side by several inches, and the resulting misalignment of the tower's elevator rails, the grand opening for the complex was delayed until February 1987. The complete complex featured the world's only elevated metro station in a skyscraper (Knight Center station). It also gained notoriety for its luxurious interiors, including a skylobby on the 11th floor covered in marble and gold and a outdoor terrace. Also its indoor gym features mahogany cabinets.

The arboretum is 72 acres, and is open to the public.\n\nThe Arboretum’s collections include nearly 1,700 accessioned woody plants and about 25,000 total plants, comprising trees, shrubs, and perennial and annual plantings laid out in the manner of European gardens. Many plantings date back to the 1920s. Recently the Arboretum has focused on increasing the diversity of woody plants and developing demonstration gardens including a lilac garden, perennial walkway, native plant garden, and labyrinth. Perennial gardens feature daylilies, purple coneflowers, and daisies; the annual flower displays include a yearly planting of some 7,000 spring bulbs including tulips and daffodils, as well as approximately 5,000 annuals and 1,500 chrysanthemums. In addition, the Kingman Museum, a natural history museum and planetarium, is located on the Arboretum grounds.\n\nThe Leila Arboretum dates back to 1922 when Leila Post Montgomery, widow of breakfast cereal magnate C. W. Post, purchased 72 acres (291,000 m²) of an old country club and donated the land to the City of Battle Creek “to be laid out and improved as a public Arboretum...”. This gift was part of the larger vision of Edward M. Brigham who started planning an educational campus consisting of a museum, an historical building for the Battle Creek Historical Society, a fine arts building, a hall of music, and a lyceum (lecture hall) building. Mrs. Charles E. Kolb, W. I. Fell and Burritt Hamilton donated additional land, and the combined property, which became known as Leila Arboretum, was designed and developed by T. Clifton Shepard between 1924 and 1930. However, the Great Depression soon overshadowed these plans and the gardens fell into great disrepair. They were finally revived in 1982 by a band of volunteers who styled themselves the Leila Arboretum Society and who set about the ultimately successful task of reclaiming the fine landscapes hidden under years of overgrown brush.\n\n\n"}

In the second half of the 20th century it spread in Germany to the north and west across Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein and the Netherlands to the North Sea coast. Already 1881 it was present in Jutland (Denmark). In 1955, the northern distribution limit of indigenous Danish populations was Falster, Lolland and Zealand. It reached Sweden in the 1970s, and in 1973 it was first seen in Finland. \"A. levana\" was found on May 30, 1973, in south-eastern Finland, in Lauritsala, by a young lepidopterist, Mr Jouko E. Hokka. The specimen was the first known \"A. levana\" in northern Europe, excluding Denmark. Since 1983, the map has been established in Finland and has since steadily increased its area.\n\nIn the UK this species is a very rare vagrant, but there have also been several unsuccessful – and now illegal – attempts at introducing this species over the past 100 years or so: in the Wye Valley in 1912, the Wyre Forest in the 1920s, South Devon 1942, Worcester 1960s, Cheshire 1970s, South Midlands 1990s. All these introductions failed and eggs or larvae have never been recorded in the wild in the UK. (Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 it is now illegal to release a non-native species into the wild.)\n\n\"A. levana\" L. (64d) has on a reddish ochreous ground a characteristic pattern of spots, some whitish sub-apical and distomarginal spots on the forewing and a row of blue bars near the distal margin of the hindwing. The underside of the forewing on the whole agrees with the upper, but the apical area bears violet dusting, the ground-colour is paler, and there are sharply defined white lines at the cell-spots; the hindwing is for the greater part red-brown, bearing in the centre a pale transverse band which widens behind, in places light lines traverse the wing and there is a dull violet smear in the distal area; the margin of both wings bears thin black lines. This is the first brood, which flies early in the spring (April—May). There occur among the ordinary form occasionally specimens in which the black basal and costal markings are confluent and both\nwings dark-margined, while the other markings of the wings (in the centre) are quite or nearly obsolete, these areas therefore being nearly uniformly red-brown. This is ab. \"frivaldszkyi\" Aigner. The summer-brood (July till August), sometimes also a third brood (September—October), is essentially different, being known as ab. \"prorsa\" L. (64d). Black, the forewing with white spots, the hindwing with a white transverse band; for the greater part red-brown beneath, with whitish lines and bands. On the upperside there appear vestiges of reddish yellow lines at the distal margin; specimens in which these lines are absent or only in places slightly indicated, while the white markings are narrowed, are ab. \"obscura\" Fruhst. (64f). If the white marking is narrowed to a yellowish stripe, or if the hindwing is entirely black, the name ab. \"schultzi\" Pfitzn. may be employed. Specimens in which the upperside is entirely without white bands, the small spots in the distal area being either present or absent, have been named ab. \"weismanni\" Fisch. (artificially produced). On the other hand the individuals with the bands partly yellowish and the reddish yellow distal markings strongly developed may be named ab. \"intermedia\" form. nov. (64d); not rare in nature, being especially frequent in wet and cold summers. It forms the transition to ab. \"porima\" O. (64d) which is already so much changed in the direction of the spring-brood that the reddish yellow colour in the distal area forms the ground-colour, the bands of \"prorsa\", however, still being visible. Finally, ab. \"diluta\" Spul. is an artificially produced variety which resembles \"porima\", but the forewing has an archaic Nymphalidian character in the row of spots recalling the ocelli found in the Satyrids. All these forms are connected by intergradations, \"prorsa\" being considered the more recent form, which can be changed by the application of cold into \"levana\" (the ancestral form), while the inverse does not take place. — The egg of the species is ovate, flattened above, ribbed, of a greenish colour. The larva feeds on \"Urtica dioica\" gregariously; it is black or pale brown with black stripes, sometimes with a reddish side-line, armed with short branched thorns, which are black, sometimes yellow. Pupa brown, spotted with blackish, the projections of the head and back obtuse, sometimes with metallic spots. The pupa of the last brood hibernates. The species is distributed over Central and East Europe (except England) southward to Dalmatia, through Armenia, Siberia, Amurland, Ussuri, Corea to Japan (here apparently in 3 broods), the varieties recurring in the East without showing any striking or constant differences from those of the West.\n\nThe map is unusual in that its two annual broods look very different. The summer brood are black with white markings, looking like a miniature version of the white admiral and lacking most of the orange of the pictured spring brood.\n\nThe eggs are laid in long strings, one on top of the other, on the underside of stinging nettles, the larval food plant. It is thought that these strings of eggs mimic the flowers of the nettles, thereby evading predators. The larvae feed gregariously and hibernate as pupae.\nTh map prefers moist habitats with stinging nettles, as they are found in open forests, at forest edges and transitional moors. both the needs of the caterpillars for high humidity and shade as well as the moths for abundant flowering perennials must be met. The insect lives in the flat and hilly country of the lowlands and rarely rises more than 1000 meters.\n"}
{"id": "2221641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221641", "title": "Montgó Massif", "text": "Montgó Massif\n\nMontgó () is a mountain in Alicante Province, Spain, which rises to . It is the last spur on the Cordillera Prebética Mountain Range and is located in the Marina Alta region in the north of Alicante between the towns of Dénia and Jávea. The mountain rises dramatically from the valley floors surrounding it and dominates the skyline for miles around. Its craggy cliffs are home to some of the most unusual flora and fauna in Spain. The mountain is renowned for its rock formations, cliffs, caves and natural harbours. From the Xàbia side Montgó is often said to resemble the head and trunk of an elephant. The mountain can be easily reached by highway CV-736 which links Denia with Jávea, both of which are accessible via the AP-7 motorway or the N-332 national highway.\n\nThe Montgó Nature Reserve encompasses 2150 hectares (5312 acres) around the mountain. It includes a coastal section that covers over . The Reserve contains important archaeological finds such as cave paintings, Phoenician amphoras and the remains of Iberian settlements. Because of its extraordinary wealth of flora, fauna and ecosystems the park was declared an officially protected nature reserve in 1987. The reserve runs almost parallel to the coastline, joining the coastal area via a flat area known as ‘les Planes’ which ends at Cap de San Antoni.\n\nThe mountain was formed during the Cretaceous period, some 70 million years ago, when plate tectonic processes forced the African and European continental plates upwards, creating spectacular mountainous landscapes such as that of the Montgó. Over the next few million years, strong erosion and rock slides sculpted it to the shape it has today.\n\nThe geological composition of this Nature Reserve is characterized by Cretaceous materials. On the lower parts, marl and marlaceous lime abound, while the escarpments are formed by compact limestone.\n\nThe geology and climate of the Montgó has fostered more than 650 species of flora. The primitive Mediterranean oak, which once dominated the mountain before over-exploitation by man, is still present, as is Mount Atlas Pistachio, rosemary, white hellebore, rock lavender, marine juniper and cistus.\n\nIn the higher more humid areas there are a number of endemic plants such as the \"Hippocrepis Valentina\" and the Valencian rock violet, as well as the blue Mediterranean fan palm (usually seen in the plains), the only palm species to grow wild in Europe. In addition, the \"Carduncellus Dianius\" or ‘Hierba Santa’ as it is known in Spanish, is unique and only found here and in Ibiza.\n\nThe Montgó flora also includes Kermes oak groves dotted with mastic trees and \"rhamnnus alaternus\", as well as the Mediterranean scrub. On the summit there is red lavender and Kermes oak. These take over from the communities of holm oak which dominate the more protected areas with deeper soil.\n\nOn the cliffs of the Cap de Sant Antoni, the vegetation is characterised by plants adapted to growing in the fissures, cracks and sherves of the cliff, and able to withstand contact with salt water. In the areas closest to the sea, Marine Fennel and the everlasting flower, \"Helichrysum decumbens\", can be found. As one moves away from the sea and the salinity decreases the valencian rock violet appears as well as cave scabius on the steeper slopes. On more level ground, diannic endemic plants can be found (the town of Denia takes its name from the cult to the Roman goddess Diana) such as the valencian rock violet and also diannic pitiusic vegetation (in reference to the nearby archipelago Pitiusas) such as rock thistle and valerian can be found.\n\nOn the plain, as on the hillside, lavender and Kermes oak grow mingled with repopulated aleppo or carrasco pine and vegetation typical of unirrigated land. Shady cliffs, with their increased humidity level, isolation and inaccessibility encourage the growth of endemic plants such as valencian rock violet, Cave Scabius, \"Sanguisorba ancistroides\", and\" Sarcocapnos saetabensis\". On wider shelves, a community of Black Sabina and \"Chamaerops humilis\" has developed. In areas exposed to the sun, various communities of species adapted to high temperatures and scarce humidity levels are located, such as \"Chaenorrhinum crassifolium\" and \"Teucrium hifacense\".\n\nThe marine bird life comprises the yellow-footed gull (\"Larus cachinnans\"), Sandwich tern (\"Sterna sandvicensis\") and Audouin's gull (\"Larus audouinii\"), amongst other species. The peregrine falcon and the Eurasian eagle owl live on the Montgó as well as eagles, ravens, seagulls and an abundance of other migratory birds. In the higher areas the patiamarilla gull nests and Audouin's gull winters along with Bonelli's eagle.\n\nIn total there are eight species of birds of prey in the Montgó Natural Park which have been documented to be breeding. Four of these species are nocturnal (eagle owl, Eurasian scops owl, tawny owl and the little owl) and the other four diurnal (goshawk, peregrine falcon, kestrel and sparrow-hawk). They feed on the many rabbits, foxes, toads, snakes, badgers, dormice, country rats, badgers, gineta, weasels and bats which share their mountain home. Although there is no concrete evidence as yet, it is probable that buzzards, short-toed eagles and the Eleanora's falcon also reproduce in the Montgó park.\n\nDue to shortages of places to collect water, amphibians are rare, although the common toad and the corridor toad (\"Bufo calamita\") are still found. Reptiles are more frequent, such as the common small lizard, the ocelad lizard, the horseshoe snake, and, most exotically, the Iberian \"eslizón\". As regards invertebrate species, there are a great number of gasteropedes communities and insects.\n\nThe first evidence of human presence on Montgó dates to the Paleolithic period some 30,000 years ago. During this period, small nomadic groups occupied the caves and hills that faced the sea in the Cap de San antoni. The communities lived a hunter-gatherer way of life, and were able to survive thanks to rich fishing grounds, plentiful supply of animals and mild temperatures. Evidence of human presence in past millennia can be seen in the famous paintings in Migdia cave. Elsewhere on the mountain Stone-Age hand-axes and flints have been found along with Roman pottery and Muslim ceramics.\n\nAt the beginning of the 10th century the moorish Caliph, Abd ur Rahman the Third, made a special trip from Cordoba to collect over a hundred medicinal herbs from the slopes of Montgó.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, a high demand for raisins led to the cultivation of the Moscatel grape on its slopes. Today, these areas have been largely abandoned due to difficulty in accessibility and non-profitability. Yet some vines, which produce the sweet grape variety, mostly the Mistela of the Marina Alta, as well as some citrus products, are still grown.\n\nClouds are often seen forming around the peak of Montgó even when the sky is clear elsewhere. This is caused by Orographic lift. Humid air from the Mediterranean is forced up towards the summit of the Montgó, then condenses and falls as rain. Despite its dry and austere appearance, rain is common on the mountain, with peak precipitation occurring between September and November. However, during the summer there is often a long period of drought.\n\nIt is possible to climb to the top of Montgó from all sides. The excursion leads through numerous eco-systems: stony terrain, croplands, pine forests and scrub land. The ascent takes about four hours. At the summit of Montgó one will find the remains of the Casa de Biot, an Iberian settlement of the eighth century B.C. From the summit there are magnificent views of the coast and the sea and on a clear day, Ibiza can be seen.\n\nDecree 25/87 issued on March 16, 1987 by the Consell of the Generalitat Valenciana declared the Montgó a Natural Park. This decree has since been modified by Ordinance 110/92. Law 5/88 issued on June 24, 1988 by the Generalitat Valenciana protects the nature reserves of the Province of Valencia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2221642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221642", "title": "Assay sensitivity", "text": "Assay sensitivity\n\nAssay sensitivity is a property of a clinical trial defined as the ability of a trial to distinguish an effective treatment from a less effective or ineffective intervention. Without assay sensitivity, a trial is not internally valid and is not capable of comparing the efficacy of two interventions.\n\nLack of assay sensitivity has different implications for trials intended to show a difference greater than zero between interventions (superiority trials) and trials intended to show non-inferiority. Non-inferiority trials attempt to rule out some margin of inferiority between a test and control intervention i.e. rule out that the test intervention is no worse than the control intervention by a chosen amount.\n\nIf a trial intended to demonstrate efficacy by showing superiority of a test intervention to control lacks assay sensitivity, it will fail to show that the test intervention is superior and will fail to lead to a conclusion of efficacy.\n\nIn contrast, if a trial intended to demonstrate efficacy by showing a test intervention is non-inferior to an active control lacks assay sensitivity, the trial may find an ineffective intervention to be non-inferior and could lead to an erroneous conclusion of efficacy. \nWhen two interventions within a trial are shown to have different efficacy (i.e., when one intervention is superior), that finding itself directly demonstrates that the trial had assay sensitivity (assuming the finding is not related to random or systematic error). In contrast, a trial that demonstrates non-inferiority between two interventions, or an unsuccessful superiority trial, generally does not contain such direct evidence of assay sensitivity.\n\nAssay sensitivity for a non-inferiority trial may depend upon the chosen margin of inferiority ruled out by the trial, and the design of the planned non-inferiority trial. The chosen margin of inferiority in a non-inferiority trial cannot be larger than the largest effect size which the control intervention reliably and reproducibly demonstrates compared to placebo or no treatment in past superiority trials. For instance, if there is reliable and reproducible evidence from previous superiority trials of an effect size of 10% for a control intervention compared to placebo, an appropriately designed non-inferiority trial designed to rule out that the test intervention may be as much as 5% less effective than the control would have assay sensitivity. On the other hand, with this same data, a noninferiority trial designed to rule out that the test intervention may be as much as 15% less effective than the control may not have assay sensitivity, since this trial would not ensure that the test intervention is any more effective than a placebo given that the effect ruled out is larger than the effect of the control compared to placebo. The choice of the margin is sometimes problematic in non-inferiority trials. Given investigators desire to choose larger margins to decrease the sample size needed to perform a trial, the chosen margin is sometimes larger than the effect size of the control compared to placebo. In addition, a valid noninferiority trial is not possible in situations in which there is a lack of data demonstrating a reliable and reproducible effect of the control compared to placebo. \n\nIn addition to choosing a margin based upon credible past evidence, to have assay sensitivity, the planned non-inferiority trial must be designed in a way similar to the past trials which demonstrated the effectiveness of the control compared to placebo, the so-called \"constancy assumption\". In this way, non-inferiority trials have a feature in common with external (historically) controlled trials. This also means that non-inferiority trials are subject to some of the same biases as historically controlled trials; that is, the effect of a drug in a past trial may not be the same in a current trial given changes in medical practice, differences in disease definitions or changes in the natural history of a disease, differences in outcome timing and definitions, usage of concomitant medications, etc.\n\nThe finding of \"difference\" or \"no difference\" between two interventions is not a direct demonstration of the internal validity of the trial unless another internal control confirms that the study methods have the ability to show a difference, if one exists, over the range of interest (i.e. the trial contains a third group receiving placebo). Since most clinical trials do not contain an internal \"negative\" control (i.e. a placebo group) to internally validate the trial, the data to evaluate the validity of the trial comes from past trials external to the current trial.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2221650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221650", "title": "Henri Mouhot", "text": "Henri Mouhot\n\nHenri Mouhot (May 15, 1826 — November 10, 1861) was a French naturalist and explorer of the mid-19th century. He was born in Montbéliard, Doubs, France - near the Swiss border, but spent his childhood in Russia and possibly, parts of Asia. He died near Naphan, Laos. He is remembered mostly in connection to Angkor. Mouhot's tomb is located just outside of Ban Phanom, to the east of Luang Prabang.\n\nHe traveled throughout Europe with his brother Charles, studying photographic techniques developed by Louis Daguerre. In 1856, he began devoting himself to the study of Natural Science. Upon reading \"The Kingdom and People of Siam\" by Sir John Bowring in 1857, Mouhot decided to travel to Indochina to conduct a series of botanical expeditions for the collection of new zoological specimens. His initial requests for grants and passage were rejected by French companies and the government of Napoleon III. The Royal Geographical Society and the Zoological Society of London lent him their support, and he set sail for Bangkok, via Singapore.\n\nFrom his base in Bangkok in 1858, Mouhot made four journeys into the interior of Siam, Cambodia and Laos. Over a period of three years before he died, he endured extreme hardships and fended off wild animals, to explore some previously uncharted jungle territory.\n\nOn his first expedition, he visited Ayutthaya, the former capital of Siam (already charted territory), and gathered an extensive collection of insects, as well as terrestrial and river shells, and sent them on to England.\n\nIn January 1860, at the end of his second and longest journey, he reached Angkor (already charted territory) — an area spread over more than 400 km²., consisting of many sites of ancient terraces, pools, moated cities, palaces and temples, the most famous of which is Angkor Wat. He recorded this visit in his travel journals, which included three weeks of detailed observations. These journals and illustrations were later incorporated into \"Voyage dans les royaumes de Siam, de Cambodge, de Laos\" which were published posthumously.\n\nMouhot is often mistakenly credited with \"discovering\" Angkor, although \"Angkor was never lost\" — the location and existence of the entire series of Angkor sites was always known to the Khmers and had been visited by several westerners since the 16th century. \nMouhot mentions in his journals that his contemporary Father Charles Emile Bouillevaux, a French missionary based in Battambang, had reported that he and other Western explorers and missionaries had visited Angkor Wat and the other Khmer temples at least five years before Mouhot. Father Bouillevaux published his accounts in 1857: \"\"Travel in Indochina 1848–1846, The Annam and Cambodia\"\".\nPreviously, a Portuguese trader Diogo do Couto visited Angkor and wrote his accounts about it in 1550, and the Portuguese monk Antonio da Magdalena had also written about his visit to Angkor Wat in 1586.\n\nMouhot did, however, popularise Angkor in the West. \nPerhaps none of the previous European visitors wrote as evocatively as Mouhot, who included interesting and detailed sketches. \nIn his posthumously published \"Travels in Siam, Cambodia and Laos,\" Mouhot compared Angkor to the pyramids, for it was popular in the West at that time to ascribe the origin of all civilization to the Middle East. For example, he described the Buddha heads at the gateways to Angkor Thom as \"four immense heads in the Egyptian style\" and wrote of Angkor:\n\"One of these temples—a rival to that of Solomon, and erected by some ancient Michael Angelo—might take an honourable place beside our most beautiful buildings. It is grander than anything left to us by Greece or Rome, and presents a sad contrast to the state of barbarism in which the nation is now plunged.\"\n\nMouhot also wrote that: \n\"At Ongcor, there are ...ruins of such grandeur... that, at the first view, one is filled with profound admiration, and cannot but ask what has become of this powerful race, so civilized, so enlightened, the authors of these gigantic works?\"\n\nSuch quotations may have given rise to the popular misconception that Mouhot had found the abandoned ruins of a lost civilisation. The Royal Geographical Society and The Zoological Society, both interested in announcing new finds, seemed to have encouraged the rumor that Mouhot — whom they had sponsored to chart mountains and rivers and catalog new species — had discovered Angkor. Mouhot himself erroneously asserted that Angkor was the work of an earlier civilization than the Khmer. For although the very same civilization which built Angkor was alive and right before his eyes, he considered them in a \"state of barbarism\" and could not believe they were civilized or enlightened enough to have built it. He assumed that the authors of such grandeur were a disappeared race and mistakenly dated Angkor back over two millennia, to around the same era as Rome. The true history of Angkor Wat was later pieced together from the book \"The Customs of Cambodia\" written by Temür Khan's envoy Zhou Daguan to Cambodia in 1295-1296 and from stylistic and epigraphic evidence accumulated during the subsequent clearing and restoration work carried out across the whole Angkor site. It is now known that the dates of Angkor's habitation were from the early 9th to the early 15th centuries.\n\nSome have argued that Mouhot may have been a tool for French expansionism and the annexation of territories which followed shortly after his death. Mouhot himself, however, did not seem to be a hardcore colonialist, for he occasionally doubted the beneficial effects of European colonisation:\n\n\"Will the present movement of the nations of Europe towards the East result in good by introducing into these lands the blessings of our civilization? Or shall we, as blind instruments of boundless ambition, come hither as a scourge, to add to their present miseries?\"\n\nMouhot died of a malarial fever on his 4th expedition, in the jungles of Laos. He had been visiting Luang Prabang, capital of the Lan Xang kingdom, one of 3 kingdoms which eventually merged into what can be known as modern day Laos, and was under the patronage of the king. Two of his servants buried him near a French mission in Naphan, by the banks of the Nam Khan river. Mouhot's favourite servant, Phrai, transported all of Mouhot's journals and specimens back to Bangkok, from where they were shipped to Europe.\n\nA modest monument was erected over his grave in 1867 under the orders of French commander Ernest Doudart de Lagrée, who gave him this eulogy:\n\"We found everywhere the memory of our compatriot who, by the uprightness of his character and his natural benevolence, had acquired the regard and the affection of the natives.\"\nThe monument was destroyed by the overflow of the river Nam Khan. It was replaced in 1887 by a more durable crypt monument, and a maisonnette was built nearby to house and feed visitors to the white shrine. Some restoration work was done on the tomb in 1951 by the EFEO (Ecole Française d'Extrème Orient—The French School of the Far East).\n\nMouhot's tomb was consumed by the jungle and lost until it was accidentally rediscovered in 1989 by a French Laos scholar, Jean-Michel Strobino, who played a part in rehabilitating it with the support of the French embassy and the Municipality of Montbeliard, Mouhot's birth town. A new plaque was fixed to one end of the crypt in 1990 to commemorate this rediscovery. The location is now known to hotels and tourist operators in Luang Prabang, and a minivan or \"tuk tuk\" may be hired to take one the 10 km from town to visit it. This entails a walk down a steep track on the southern bank of river Nam Khan, over a small wooden bridge, and then up to a well-cleared track to the tomb, altogether about 150 meters. A new road being constructed nearby (June 2013) will make access easier. The tomb is still quite near the river (only about 20m), and access by boat from town should be possible. As more people visit the tomb, the pathway hopefully will be improved, as it is quite slippery after rain; sensible shoes are a must.\n\nThe popularity of Angkor generated by Mouhot's writings led to the popular support for a major French role in its study and preservation. The French carried out the majority of research work on Angkor until recently.\n\nTwo species of Asian reptiles are named in his honor: \"Cuora mouhotii\", a turtle; and \"Oligodon mouhoti\", a snake.\n\nMouhot's travel journals are immortalized in \"Voyage dans les royaumes de Siam, de Cambodge, de Laos et autres parties centrales de l'Indochine\" (published 1863, 1864).

The current Spanish royal family consists of the present king, King Felipe VI, the queen consort, Queen Letizia, their children Leonor, Princess of Asturias and Infanta Sofía of Spain, and the king's parents, King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofía. The House of Bourbon-Anjou is a branch of the House of Bourbon that descends from Philip V of Spain. The royal family lives in Zarzuela Palace in Madrid, although their official residence is the Royal Palace of Madrid.\n\nThe titles and styles of the Royal Family are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> - Member of the Royal Family (as opposed to the Family of the King, or extended family)\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> - Member of the Extended royal family\n\nMembers of the Spanish Royal Family are often asked by non-profit charitable, cultural, or religious organizations within and without Spain to become their patrons, a role the Spanish constitution recognizes and codified in Title II Article 62 (j). It is incumbent for the monarch \"to exercise the High Patronage of the Royal Academies\". Royal patronage conveys a sense of official credibility as the organization is scrutinized for suitability. A royal presence often greatly raises the profile of the organization and attracts media publicity and public interest that the organization may not have otherwise garnered, aiding in the charitable cause or cultural event. Royalty make use of their considerable celebrity to assist the organization to raise funds or to promote government policy.\n\nAdditionally, members of the royal family may also pursue their own charitable and cultural interests. Queen Sofía devotes much of her time to the Queen Sofia Foundation (\"Fundación Reina Sofía\"); while Leonor, Princess of Asturias presents the annual Princess of Asturias Awards (\"Premios Princesa de Asturias\"), which aims to promote \"scientific, cultural and humanistic values that form part of mankind's universal heritage.\" The Princess of Asturias Foundation (\"Fundación Princesa de Asturias\") holds the annual Princess of Asturias Awards acknowledging the contributions of individuals, entities, and/or organizations from around the world who make notable achievements in the sciences, humanities, or public affairs. \n\nKing Felipe VI serves as president of the Organization of Ibero-American States which hosts the annual Ibero-American Summit, serves as president of the Codespa Foundation, which finances specific economic and social development activities in Latin American and other countries, and serves as president of the Spanish branch of the Association of European Journalists, which is composed of achieving communications professionals. King Felipe VI also serves as honorary chair of the Ministry of Culture National Awards Ceremonies.\n\nInfanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo, Juan Carlos' elder daughter, is the Director of Cultural and Social Projects of Mapfre Foundation, while Infanta Cristina, Juan Carlos' younger daughter, served as the Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations for the 2nd World Assembly on Ageing, and is a member of the Dali Foundation Board of Trustees, president of the International Foundation for Disabled Sailing, and Director of Social Welfare at the La Caixa Foundation in Barcelona where she lives with her family.\n\nKing Juan Carlos, Queen Sofia, and Infanta Cristina are all members of the Bilderberg Group, an informal think-tank centered on United States and European relations, and other world issues.\n\n"}

Routine work proved distasteful to him, and he read with avidity the works of Jean Charles, Chevalier Folard and other theoretical writers on war, and of Rousseau.\nAfter sixteen years service he left Prussia, and endeavoured without success to obtain a commission in the Austrian army. He then returned to Prussia, and for some time managed a theatrical company. The failure of this undertaking involved Bülow in heavy losses, and soon afterwards he went to America, where he seems to have been converted to, and to have preached, Swedenborgianism.\n\nOn his return to Europe he persuaded his brother to engage in a speculation for exporting glass to the United States, which proved a complete failure. After this for some years he made a precarious living in Berlin by literary work, but his debts accumulated, and it was under great disadvantages that he produced his \"Geist des Neueren Kriegssystems\" (Hamburg, 1799) and \"Der Feldzug 1801\" (Berlin, 1801). His hopes of military employment were again disappointed, and his brother, the future field marshal, who had stood by him in all his troubles, finally left him.\n\nIn 1797, Bülow published his two-volume \"Der Freistaat von Nordamerika in seinem neuesten Zustand\". It offered an decidedly negative account of the United States. John Quincy Adams, then U.S. minister at Berlin, translated the work, describing it as a \"libel upon America.\" Adams' transcription was subsequently published in Joseph Dennie's Philadelphia-based \"Port Folio\" in the early 1800s.\n\nAfter wandering in France and the smaller German states, Bulow reappeared at Berlin in 1804, where he wrote a revised edition of his \"Geist des Neueren Kriegssystems\" (Hamburg, 1805), \"Lehrstze des Neueren Kriegs\" (Berlin, 1805), \"Geschichte des Prinzen Heinrich von Preussen\" (Berlin, 1805), \"Neue Taktik der Neuern wie sie sein sollte\" (Leipzig, 1805), and \"Der Feldzug 1805\" (Leipzig, 1806). He also edited, with G. H. von Behrenhorst (1733–1814) and others, \"Annalen des Krieges\" (Berlin, 1806). These brilliant but unorthodox works, distinguished by an open contempt of the Prussian system, cosmopolitanism hardly to be distinguished from high treason, and the mordant sarcasm of a disappointed man, brought upon Bülow the enmity of the official classes and of the government. He was arrested as insane, but medical examination proved him sane and he was then lodged as a prisoner in Kolberg, where he was harshly treated, though August von Gneisenau obtained some mitigation of his condition. Thence he passed into Russian hands and died in prison at Riga in 1807, probably as a result of ill-treatment.\n\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition: \n\nHis early training had shown him merely the pedantic minutiae of Frederick's methods, and, in the absence of any troops capable of illustrating the real linear tactics, he became an enthusiastic supporter of the methods, which (more of necessity than from judgment) the French revolutionary generals had adopted, of fighting in small columns covered by skirmishers. Battles, he maintained, were won by skirmishers. We must organize disorder, he said; indeed, every argument of writers of the modern extended order school is to be found \"mutatis mutandis\" in Bülow, whose system acquired great prominence in view of the mechanical improvements in armament. But his tactics, like his strategy, were vitiated by the absence of friction, and their dependence on the realization of an unattainable standard of bravery.\n\n"}
{"id": "2221663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221663", "title": "Grayling (butterfly)", "text": "Grayling (butterfly)\n\nThe grayling or rock grayling (\"Hipparchia semele\") is a species in the brush-footed butterfly family Nymphalidae. Although found all over Europe, the grayling mostly inhabits coastal areas, with inland populations declining significantly in recent years. The grayling lives in dry and warm habitats with easy access to the sun, which helps them with body temperature regulation.\n\nA grayling goes through four stages in its life cycle. The eggs hatch around August, and larvae grow in four instars from August to the following June. By June, the larvae begin to pupate by spinning a silk cocoon below the surface of the ground. The adult grayling emerges around August. The grayling migrates in small groups of two or three butterflies throughout most of August, typically moving southeast.\n\n\"H. semele\" engages in cryptic coloring, with their tan and brown colored wings helping them camouflage into their surroundings. The grayling exposes the eyespots on its wings when it believes to have been detected by a predator, but generally keeps them hidden to avoid being seen. Male butterflies are territorial, and engage in flight performances to determine who settles in the best oviposition site. Additionally, the grayling regulates its body temperature by orienting its body and posture to adjust to the heat from the sun.\n\nGrayling populations have recently begun to decline, and while it is not globally endangered, the species is now considered a priority for conservation efforts in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Hipparchia semele\" lives at elevations between sea level and about . The grayling is a species endemic to Europe, and is found almost all over Europe and parts of western Russia. In parts of northern and western Europe, including Scandinavia, Britain, Ireland, and the Baltic states, it can be seen mostly in the coastal areas. The butterfly population is declining in many areas, especially inland. The grayling is not found in west France, large parts of Greece, Albania, North Macedonia, and south of Bulgaria and the Mediterranean islands.\n\n\"S. semele\" L. (42 f). The female above similar to the preceding [ \"anthe\" ie. dark brown with a yellow-orange submarginal band marked in the female, more discreet in the male, with an interrupted fringe and two black blind or very discreetly pupiled ocelli on the forewing and a very small oocellus on the hindwing.The verso of the forewing is yellow-orange surrounded by a marbled band of brown and white with the two black ocelli while the hindwing verso is marbled with brown and white.], but the bands above ivory-yellow, often obscured, especially on the hindwing. The male above almost entirely dark, the band being only perceptible on the hindwing in the form of a row of obsolete ochre-yellow spots. Both sexes show, on a pale ochre ground, before the anal angle a dark ocellus which occasionally is pupilled with white. The underside of the hindwing is marbled with dark, a pale powdering in the form of a band terminating the basal portion distally. this band protruding in a strong tooth below the cell towards the margin.\n\nGrayling populations are typically found in dry habitats with warm climates to aid in their thermoregulatory behavior. Often found in sand dunes, salt marshes, undercliffs, and clifftops in coastal regions, and heathlands, limestone pavements, scree and brownfield land in inland regions, but graylings are also known to inhabit old quarries, railway lines, and industrial areas. Colonies typically develop around areas with little vegetation and bare, open ground, with spots of shelter and sun to help them regulate their body temperature.\n\n\"Hipparchia semele\" can be considered a specialist feeding species. They tend to feed on the following plants:\n\n\"Hipparchia semele\" sometimes lay their eggs on the green leaves that the larvae later feed on. Because the adult butterflies lay their eggs on the ground, the larvae can easily find the host plants to feed on. Therefore, laying eggs directly on host plants does not seem to be crucial for survival to adulthood.\n\n\"Note that information on this species applies to Great Britain and some details may not be consistent with the species in other parts of its range.\"\n\nThere is one generation per year. The eggs are laid from July to September singly, often on the food plant. \"H. semele\" eggs are white at first, but turn pale yellow as they develop. The egg stage generally lasts between two and three weeks.\n\nWhen the eggs hatch, the caterpillar grows slowly, feeding at night and typically hibernating during cold temperatures in a deep patch of grass. The larvae are small and cream colored, and there are four moults. The first-instar and second-instar larvae feed in mid-to-late summer and then hibernate, while still small, in the third instar, at the base of a tussock. Feeding then resumes in the spring and the last instar larvae are nocturnal, hiding in the base of grass tussocks during the day. These larval instars take place from August to June. By June, the larvae should be fully grown, and at this point the caterpillar spends most of its time basking in the sun on the bare ground or rocks. The larvae are attracted to muddy puddles and sap from tree trunks. When the time comes to pupate, the caterpillar spins a cocoon in the ground.\n\nPupation happens in a cavity lined with silk below the surface of the ground. The pupa is unattached in an earth cell. The pupal stage lasts around four weeks. The pupa is formed from June to August and the adult butterflies emerge in August.\n\nThe \"Hipparchia semele\" often migrates in small groups of two or three, generally at 10-11 kilometers per hour. The flight direction of these migrating grayling is direct and constant, notably because they do not pause or dart off into short flights. The grayling generally migrates in the southeast direction through most of August.\n\n\"Hipparchia semele\" engages in cryptic coloring, or camouflage that makes it difficult to see them when they are resting on the bare ground, tree trunks, rocks, etc. Their tan and brown colored wings help them conceal themselves. Usually at rest and when not in flight, the butterflies keep their wings closed, with their forewings tucked behind their hindwings. This helps them conceal their eyespots and makes them appear smaller, further helping them camouflage to their environment.\n\nAdditionally, the forewing of a \"Hipparchia semele\" has one large and one small eyespot. When the grayling butterfly believes it may have been detected by a predator, it exposes these spots. However, there may be a balance between their cryptic coloring behavior and the exposure of their conspicuous eye spots. Exposing their spots may increase detectability by their predators. Therefore, at rest, the grayling adopts its cryptic coloring position, pulling its forewings down behind its hindwings in order to conceal the eyespots.\n\nWhen it comes time to mate, male and female \"H. semele\" meet above a solitary tree in a wide and open area. This takes on many forms, from a tall tree in a heathland to bare patches of ground in sand dunes. The female lays her eggs on various fine-leaved grasses, including fescues, bents, and bromes, a few centimeters above the ground.\n\nMale butterflies exhibit behaviors for defending territories. Females choose males based on the best territory for them to lay their eggs in. These territorial males engage in competitions of flight performances where the winning male settles in the territory. Thermoregulation helps these butterflies prepare for maximum flight efficiency in order to gain ownership of the most optimal territory.\n\nMale graylings make short and frequent flights, both spontaneous and non-spontaneous. These may function as a signal of display for females.\n\nThe male graylings’ courtship procedure for copulation may also serve to indicate to the female the amount and the nature of the males’ sex pheromones. Further research must be conducted to determine this for certain, but the courtship procedure likely plays a role in pheromone production. \"Hipparchia semele\" only copulate once, so determining the best possible male, based on the pheromones and courting procedure, is very important for reproductive success. Pheromone releasers are located all over the wings of the males.\n\nGrayling females partake in resource defense polygyny. Females choose a territorial male in order to gain the best oviposition site. This allows for a higher survival rate of the eggs, as well as the inheritance of the ability to defend the best territories which are attractive to females, leading to a higher reproductive rate of the offspring, thus allowing the female grayling a higher opportunity to propagate her genes.\nA complex courtship procedure is performed by grayling males for copulation. The male moves behind the female, and engages in short movements around her until they are facing each other. Then, the male raises his forewings slowly, and quickly lowers and closes them, continuing this rhythmically. He then spreads his antennae to create a circular shape, and spreads his wings so the forewings are separated from the hindwings. After closing the wings again slowly, the male moves around the female again, and attempts copulation.\n\nThe grayling is a large and distinctive butterfly when in flight. The flight of a grayling is characterized by strong loops.\n\nThe flying patterns of a grayling are also important in male-male interactions of territoriality. Initially, when defending a territory, each male grayling flies in a spiral motion, trying to be higher than and behind the other male. When this formation is stabilized, the two male graylings go into an alternating sequence of dives and climbs. At the end, the male that is able to achieve the highest position settles in the territory.\n\nThe graylings prefer to live in open habitats, with easy access to the sun. This may be due to their ability to regulate their body temperature using the sun. When the temperature gets too cold, the grayling leans to expose its side towards the sunlight, therefore allowing its wings to gain heat from the sun. When the temperature gets too warm, the grayling stands straight, on its tiptoes, exposing its head towards the sun and keeping the majority of its body away.\n\nThe male tends to orient its body and wings to control which parts of the body are exposed to the sun. This allows the grayling to keep its body temperature as close to the preferred level as possible. Therefore, at lower temperatures, the male grayling exposes as much of its body area as it can to increase the surface area facing the sun. This process is sometimes called sun-basking. This can raise body temperatures by up to 3 degrees Celsius. Contrarily, at high temperatures, the male grayling exposes as little of its body area as possible to the sun. This process can lower body temperatures by up to 2.5 degrees Celsius. At intermediate temperatures, the male grayling is often observed gradually changing his body orientation and posture in order to evenly spread the heat all over his body. This behavior can often be observed by male butterflies defending their territories. Many times, the territories that male graylings defend are specific mating sites. Thermoregulation allows the male butterflies to maximize their efficiency, in order to prepare for optimal flight performance if another male enters the territory.\n\nThe grayling has been decreasing in numbers significantly in recent years. While it was not considered of importance before, \"Hipparchia semele\" is now considered a priority species for conservation efforts in the United Kingdom.\n\nIt is now a UK Biodiversity Action Plan species (Butterfly Conservation, 2007).\n\nMuch of the \"Hipparchia semele\"’s common habitats, such as heathlands, have started to become transformed into agricultural land. The dry habitats are occupied by trees and other greenery, reducing the optimal available habitats for the graylings.\n\n"}
{"id": "2221668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221668", "title": "KXAN-TV", "text": "KXAN-TV\n\nKXAN-TV, virtual channel 36 (UHF digital channel 21), is an NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Austin, Texas, United States. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, as part of a duopoly with Llano-licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate KBVO (channel 14); Nexstar also operates CW affiliate KNVA (channel 54) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with owner Vaughan Media. The three stations share studios on West Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard between the Old West Austin section of Austin and the University of Texas at Austin campus (a setup which consists of the main studio and newsroom, and an unconnected auxiliary office building across the street); KXAN's transmitter is located at the West Austin Antenna Farm north of West Lake Hills.\n\nOn cable, KXAN can be seen on Charter Spectrum, Suddenlink and Grande Communications channel 4.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on February 12, 1965, as KHFI-TV, broadcasting on UHF channel 42. It was owned by the Kingsbury family, along with KHFI radio (970 AM, now KTSN at 1490; and 98.3 FM, now KVET-FM at 98.1). KHFI was the second television station in Austin, signing on a little more than twelve years after KTBC-TV (channel 7). Although Austin was big enough to support three television stations as early as the 1950s, KTBC was the only VHF license in the area. Until 1964, UHF stations could only be seen with an expensive converter, and even then picture quality left much to be desired. Additionally, UHF signals usually do not travel very far over long distances or over rugged terrain. This made several potential owners skittish about the prospects for UHF in a market that stretched from Mason in the west to La Grange in the east, and also included much of the Hill Country.\n\nKHFI-TV logically should have signed on as Austin's NBC station, since up to that time all three networks had been shoehorned on KTBC, then a primary CBS affiliate. However, due to contractual obligations, it spent more than a year-and-a-half as an independent before joining NBC in 1966. Unlike most affiliates with the network in then two-station markets, KHFI did not take on a secondary ABC affiliation (KTBC instead took on the secondary ABC affiliation, until a third station, KVUE signed on in 1971, taking on the ABC affiliation). The Kingsburys would later bring in Henry Tippie as a partner and on January 15, 1973 were granted permission from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to move KHFI-TV to channel 36.\nWith the channel change came a new set of call letters, KTVV. The station also boosted its transmitter power to five million watts, which more than doubled its coverage area, and for a time billed itself as the most powerful TV station in the Southwest with these changes. What was then known as LIN Broadcasting purchased the station in 1979. The call letters were changed to the current KXAN-TV on October 15, 1987, in reference to then-sister station and fellow NBC affiliate (now owned-and-operated station) KXAS-TV in Fort Worth. Even with the increased power, channel 36's signal was marginal in some parts of the Hill Country such as Fredericksburg. On September 6, 1991, LIN signed on KLNO in Llano to improve KXAN's reach in the Hill Country. It changed that station's call letters to KXAM-TV after about a month on the air and later to the current KBVO on August 3, 2009. This call sign, named after the University of Texas' mascot \"Bevo\", was formerly used on the current channel 42—which is now CBS affiliate KEYE-TV—from December 1983 to July 1995, and is shared with channel 14's repeater KBVO-CD.\nKXAN is one of two stations in Austin (the other being KVUE, channel 24) to retain its original network affiliation in the wake of a network swap between KTBC and Fox station KBVO (now KEYE-TV, channel 42) in 1995, the result of Fox's affiliation deal with New World Communications due to that network acquiring rights to NFL games. On October 21, 2009, KBVO became a separate station after picking up the MyNetworkTV affiliation from KNVA. That station carried the network as a secondary affiliation (airing on KNVA on Monday through Saturday nights from 9 to 11 p.m.), known on-air as \"MyNetworkTV on The CW Austin\", from its launch on September 5, 2006. In mid-September 2009, that station moved MyNetworkTV programs an hour later from 10 p.m. to midnight to make room for a nightly 9 p.m. newscast to compete with KTBC's established prime time newscast. To date, KNVA was one of two stations in the United States to carry The CW and MyNetworkTV (the other being KWKB in Iowa City, Iowa, which until 2011 was the only station that carried the full schedules of both netlets/programming services).\n\nKXAN's current tower was activated in 1996, replacing an older structure that had been built in 1964. Of the fifteen towers on the hill, the channel 36 tower is the tallest and the highest structure in Austin. In addition to its transmission antenna, the mast also incorporates a camera with views of downtown to the east and the hills to the west.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, it was announced that Media General would acquire LIN. The merger was completed on December 19, 2014, and KXAN joined the Media General station portfolio. Just over a year after that deal was completed, on January 27, 2016, Media General announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Nexstar Broadcasting Group (who is based in Irving and already owns many other stations in Texas), in a deal valued at $17.14 per-share, valuing the company at $4.6 billion plus the assumption of $2.3 billion debt. The combined company would be known as Nexstar Media Group, and own 171 stations (including KXAN-TV), serving an estimated 39% of households. The merger also marked a re-entry into Austin for Nexstar, which had managed CBS affiliate KEYE-TV under a groupwide agreement with the Four Points Media Group before that company's stations were sold to Sinclair at the beginning of 2012. The deal was finalized on January 17, 2017.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn August 7, 2009, KXAN began offering Mobile TV service through BlackBerry.\n\nKXAN-TV shut down its analog signal on June 12, 2009, as part of the FCC-mandated transition to digital television for full-power stations. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 21, using PSIP to display the KXAN-TV's virtual channel as 36 on digital television receivers.\n\nKXAN and LIN TV were locked into a contract dispute with Suddenlink Communications, which serves portions of the Austin market, such as Pflugerville and Georgetown. The dispute centered around KXAN's failure to grant retransmission consent to Suddenlink. The station was removed from Suddenlink after the previous contract expired on December 31, 2007. KXAN claimed that it was seeking \"fair value\" for its programming. However, a press release from Suddenlink management indicated that the dispute included consideration for other stations owned by LIN TV outside of Texas.\n\nOn January 3, 2008, Suddenlink began transmitting the signal of Temple-based NBC affiliate KCEN-TV to restore the network's programming to the affected areas. This is allowed under FCC rules because KCEN is a \"significantly viewed\" station in Williamson County even though that county is located in the Austin market. On March 24, Suddenlink and KXAN's dispute was settled and the station's programming was restored to Suddenlink's systems the following day. The terms of the settlement were not announced though it is widely believed that KXAN had lost thousands of viewers. Despite its cable carriage problems, the station surprised many observers by placing first in the 5–7 a.m. weekday time slot during the May 2008 sweeps period.\n\nKXAN and LIN TV were locked in another contract dispute with Time Warner Cable, which serves a very large majority of the Austin metropolitan area. LIN dropped its stations from Time Warner Cable systems nationwide at Midnight CDT on October 3, 2008. Over-the-air stations such as KXAN have long allowed cable companies to carry their signals for free. Cable networks are paid as much as ten cents per day per subscriber for their content and LIN TV wanted Time Warner to pay them less than one cent per subscriber per day. KXAN general manager Eric Lassberg stated that the cable company \"does not have to pass that cost along to the viewers unless they want to\". On October 3, Time Warner replaced KXAN with a continuous loop of instructions on how to hook up a television to a computer on Time Warner Cable. Some days later this was replaced by the premium channel Starz Kids and Family. KXAN returned to the Time Warner lineup during the early morning hours of October 29, 2008. No details were released on the deal though some have speculated that KXAN could not afford to be without over 67% of their previous viewers during the critical November ratings period.\n\nSyndicated programming on KXAN includes \"Wheel of Fortune\", \"Jeopardy!\", \"Dr. Phil\" and \"Rachael Ray\". KXAN is the Austin broadcast television home of the San Antonio Spurs, sharing coverage with sister station KBVO.\n\nKXAN-TV presently broadcasts 31 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday and three hours each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nFor most of its first 30 years on the air, KHFI/KTVV/KXAN was a distant runner-up to KTBC. Despite efforts to produce a newscast of major market quality (early newscasts deliberately copied the look of NBC owned-and-operated station WNBC in New York City), it was usually unable to make a dent in KTBC's ratings dominance. Another setback was as a UHF station, KTVV/KXAN had a hard time maintaining a local share as an NBC affiliate due to the presence of nearby NBC stations in the San Antonio and Temple/Waco markets. KXAN's first number one rated newscast was also Austin's first hour-long morning newscast, News 36 Firstcast, which went on the air in November 1990. All other local stations soon followed suit, but Firstcast built an audience that delivered KXAN the station's first sweeps victory in February 1993. After KTBC switched to its current Fox affiliation in 1995, KXAN's ratings slowly increased in other time periods. By the latter part of the 1990s, channel 36 had overtaken channel 7 for the lead. Since then, it has waged a spirited battle for first place in the market with KVUE.\n\nOn December 23, 2008, starting with the weekday noon newscast, KXAN became the third television station in the Austin market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. On September 28, 2009, the station began producing a nightly 9 p.m. newscast on KNVA (currently titled \"KXAN News at 9\") to compete with KTBC's longer-established and hour-long prime time newscast.\n\nOn September 3, 2013, KXAN began producing a two-hour extension of its weekday morning newscast for sister station KNVA. Known as \"KXAN News on The CW Austin,\" the expanded broadcast runs from 7 to 9 a.m. and competes against KTBC's long-dominant morning newscast \"Good Day Austin\" and the national morning programs on the market's other major network affiliates.\n\n"}

He lived among grizzly bears of Katmai National Park in Alaska for 13 summers. At the end of his 13th summer in the park, in 2003, he and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were killed and almost fully eaten by a 28-year-old brown bear, whose stomach was later found to contain human remains and clothing. Treadwell's life, work, and death were the subject of Werner Herzog's critically acclaimed documentary film \"Grizzly Man\" (2005).\n\nTreadwell was born on Long Island, New York, one of five children of Val and Carol Dexter. He attended Connetquot High School, where he was the swimming team's star diver. He was very fond of animals and kept a squirrel named Willie as a pet. In an interview in the film \"Grizzly Man\" (2005), his parents say he was an ordinary young man until he went away to college. There, he claimed that he was a British orphan who was born in Australia. According to this account, his father said Timothy \"spiraled down\" and became an alcoholic after he lost the role of Woody Boyd to Woody Harrelson in the sitcom \"Cheers\".\n\nTreadwell studied grizzly bears during summer seasons for 13 years, before being killed by one of them. According to his book, \"Among Grizzlies: Living with Wild Bears in Alaska\", his mission to protect bears began in the late 1980s after surviving a near fatal heroin overdose. He claims in his book that his drug addiction grew from his alcoholism.\n\nA lover of animals since he was a child, Treadwell decided to travel to Alaska to watch bears after a close friend convinced him to do so. He wrote that after his first encounter with a wild bear, he knew he had found his calling in life, and that now his destiny was entwined with that of the bears. He attributed his recovery from drug and alcohol addictions entirely to his relationship with bears.\n\nTreadwell spent the early part of each season camping on the \"Big Green\", an open area of bear grass in Hallo Bay on the Katmai Coast. He called the area \"The Grizzly Sanctuary\". Treadwell was known for getting extremely close to the bears he observed, sometimes even touching them and playing with bear cubs. However, in his book, he claimed that he was always careful with the bears and actually developed a sense of mutual trust and respect with the animals. He habitually named the bears he encountered and consistently saw many of the same bears each summer, and thus claimed to build a standing relationship with them. \nIn contrast, Tom Smith, a research ecologist with the Alaska Science Center of the U.S. Geological Service declared that Treadwell \"...was breaking every park rule that there was, in terms of distance to the bears, harassing wildlife and interfering with natural processes. Right off the bat, his personal mission was at odds with the park service. He had been warned repeatedly.\" Referring to Treadwell's death, Smith concluded \"It's a tragic thing, but it's not unpredictable.\"\n\nDuring the later part of each summer he would move to Kaflia Bay and camp in an area of especially thick brush he called the \"Grizzly Maze\". Here the chances of crossing paths with grizzlies were much higher, since the location intersected bear trails. Treadwell recorded almost 100 hours of video footage (some of which was later used to create the documentary \"Grizzly Man\") and produced a large collection of still photographs.\n\nTreadwell claimed to be alone with the wildlife on several occasions in his videos. However, his girlfriend Amie was with him during parts of the last three summers (the documentary says two summers) and at the time of their deaths. Other people possibly accompanied Treadwell during the other summer trips.\n\nBy 2001, Treadwell became sufficiently notable to receive extensive media attention both on television and in environmental circles, and he made frequent public appearances as an environmental activist. He traveled throughout the United States to educate school children about bears and appeared on the Discovery Channel, the \"Late Show with David Letterman,\" and \"Dateline NBC\" to discuss his experiences.\n\nHe also co-wrote \"Among Grizzlies: Living with Wild Bears in Alaska\" with Jewel Palovak (his co-worker with whom he lived for 20 years), which describes Treadwell's adventures on the Alaska Peninsula. Treadwell and Palovak founded Grizzly People, an organization devoted to protecting bears and preserving their wilderness habitat.\n\nCharlie Russell, who studied bears, raised them, and lived with them in Kamchatka, Russia, for a decade, worked with Treadwell. Russell advised Treadwell to carry pepper spray and use electric fences. He originally refrained from commenting on Treadwell after he was killed, but after \"Grizzly Man\" was released wrote a lengthy critique of Treadwell's failure to follow basic safety precautions. In spite of his criticism of Treadwell, Russell praised him for his devotion to bears and his ability remain alive for so long. He defended him against people who criticized his work, writing, \"If Timothy had spent those thirteen years killing bears and guiding others to do the same, eventually being killed by one, he would have been remembered in Alaska with great admiration.\" Russell was critical of the film \"Grizzly Man\", saying it was unfair to Treadwell, and if Palovak \"really was a protector of bears, she should have looked for a filmaker who would have been sympathetic towards them.\"\n\nAccording to the organization Treadwell founded, Grizzly People, five bears were poached in the year following his death, while none had been poached while he was present in Katmai. However, according to court records as reported by the \"Anchorage Daily News\", the guilty parties were charged with poaching wildlife along Funnel Creek in the Preserve, an area open to hunting that borders the National Park. According to several sources, including Nick Jans' book, \"The Grizzly Maze\", Treadwell camped only near the Katmai Coast, mainly in areas around Hallo Bay and Kaflia Bay, and never in or near the Preserve. The only effective way to patrol all of Katmai National Park is by airplane, the method used by authorities.\n\nTreadwell's years with the grizzlies were not without disruption. Almost from the start, the National Park Service expressed their worries about his behavior. The Park's restrictions made him increasingly irate. According to the file kept on Treadwell by the Park Service, rangers reported he had at least six violations from 1994 to 2003. Included among these violations were guiding tourists without a license, camping in the same area longer than the Park Service's seven-day limit, improper food storage, wildlife harassment, and conflicts with visitors and their guides. Treadwell also frustrated authorities by refusing to install an electric fence around his camp and refusing to carry bear spray to use as a deterrent. In fact, Treadwell had carried pepper spray with him and had resorted to using it at least one time, but wrote that he had felt terrible grief over the pain he perceived it had caused the bear and refused to use it on subsequent occasions.\n\nIn 1998, park rangers issued Treadwell a citation for storing an ice chest filled with food in his tent. A separate incident involved rangers ordering him to remove a prohibited portable generator. When the Park Service imposed a new rule—often referred to as the \"Treadwell Rule\"—requiring all campers to move their camps at least one mile (1.6 km) every seven days, Treadwell initially obeyed the order by using a small motorboat to move his camp up and down the coast. Finding this method impractical, he later hid his camp from the Park Service in stands of trees with heavy brush. He was cited at least once for this violation.\n\nIn October 2003, Treadwell and his girlfriend, physician assistant Amie Huguenard (born October 23, 1965, in Buffalo, New York), visited Katmai National Park, which is on the Alaska Peninsula across Shelikof Strait from Kodiak Island. In \"Grizzly Man\", Werner Herzog states that according to Treadwell's diaries, Huguenard feared bears and felt very uncomfortable in their presence. Her final journal entries indicated that she wanted to be away from Katmai. Treadwell chose to set his campsite near a salmon stream where grizzlies commonly feed in autumn. Treadwell was in the park later in the year than normal, at a time when bears attempt to gain as much fat as possible before winter. Food was scarce that fall, causing the grizzly bears to be even more aggressive than usual.\n\nTreadwell was to leave the park at his usual time of year but extended his stay a week in an effort to locate a favorite female brown bear. He said he hated modern civilization and felt better in nature with the bears than he did in big cities around humans. The bears he had been used to during the summer had already gone into hibernation, and bears that Treadwell did not know from other parts of the park were moving into the area. Some of the last footage taken by Treadwell, hours before his death, includes video of a bear diving into the river repeatedly for a piece of dead salmon. Treadwell mentioned in the footage that he did not feel entirely comfortable around that particular bear. In \"Grizzly Man\", Herzog speculates on whether Treadwell filmed the very bear that killed him.\n\nAround noon on Sunday, October 5, 2003, Treadwell spoke with an associate in Malibu, California, by satellite phone; Treadwell mentioned no problems with any bears. The next day, October 6, Willy Fulton, a Kodiak air taxi pilot, arrived at Treadwell and Huguenard's campsite to pick them up but found the area abandoned, except for a bear, and contacted the local park rangers. The couple's mangled remains were discovered quickly upon investigation. Treadwell's disfigured head, partial spine, and right forearm and hand, with his wristwatch still on, were recovered a short distance from the camp. Huguenard's partial remains were found next to the torn and collapsed tents, partially buried in a mound of twigs and dirt. A large male grizzly (tagged Bear 141) protecting the campsite was killed by park rangers during their attempt to retrieve the bodies. A second adolescent bear was also killed a short time later, when it charged the park rangers. An on-site necropsy of Bear 141 revealed human body parts such as fingers and limbs. The younger bear was consumed by other animals before it could be necropsied. In the 85-year history of Katmai National Park, this was the first known incident of a person being killed by a bear.\n\nA video camera was recovered at the site that proved to have been operating during the attack, but police said that the six-minute tape contained only voices and cries as a brown bear mauled Treadwell to death. The tape begins with Treadwell yelling that he is being attacked. \"Come out here; I'm being killed out here,\" he screams. That the tape contained only sound led troopers to believe the attack might have happened while the camera was stuffed in a duffel bag or during the dark of night. In \"Grizzly Man\", filmmaker Herzog claims that the lens cap of the camera was left on, suggesting that Treadwell and Huguenard were in the process of setting up for another video sequence when the attack happened. The camera had been turned on just before the attack, presumably by sound activation, but the camera recorded only six minutes of audio before running out of tape. This, however, was enough time to record the bear's initial attack on Treadwell and his agonized screams, its retreat after Huguenard tells Treadwell to play dead and when she attacked it and its return to carry Treadwell off into the forest.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2221678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221678", "title": "Puerto Rican boa", "text": "Puerto Rican boa\n\nChilabothrus inornatus, until recently known as Epicrates inornatus, is a large species of boa; this snake is only found on the island of Puerto Rico. It is locally known most simply by the common names of culebrón, which basically means 'big snake', or more specifically as the boa puertorriqueña. For publications in English either the names Puerto Rican boa or yellow tree boa have been promoted, although it is not yellow, nor does it live in trees: it is a terrestrial snake with a dark brown coloration. It grows to in length. It feeds on small mammals such as rodents and bats, birds and sometimes anole lizards. Like all boas, it is viviparous (bearing live young) and kills its prey using constriction, squeezing its victims to death.\n\nIt is extremely similar to the Jamaican species \"Epicrates subflavus\" which was seen as the same species for some fifty years until it was split from this species in 1901 by Leonhard Hess Stejneger.\n\nThe taxon \"Piesigaster boettgeri\" was described from Mindanao, the Philippines, by the Spaniard in 1881, but was identified as a synonym of this species by Stejneger. Seoane's brother was an officer in the Spanish Navy and thus the localities of the group of specimens Seoane had obtained doubtlessly got confused during their passage to Spain.\n\nAlthough it has been known under the name \"E. inornatus\" for over a century, having been moved to the genus \"Epicrates\" (which had been created in 1830 by Johann Georg Wagler) by the Belgian zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1893 when cataloguing the specimens in the Natural History Museum, London, a number of authors decided to it move to \"Chilabothrus inornatus\" in 2013. It had first been moved to \"Chilabothrus inornatus\" from the genus \"Boa\" in 1844 by either the French herpetologists André Marie Constant Duméril and Gabriel Bibron, or the Italian snake expert Giorgio Jan, only a year after it had been described in that genus by the Dane Johannes Theodor Reinhardt in 1843. Reinhardt had three snakes of this species to study for his description, these are the syntypes and are stored in Copenhagen. They were collected by a certain Dr. Ravn from Puerto Rico. It is often still known as \"Epicrates inornatus\" in many publications.\n\nThe generic epithet \"epicrates\" is derived from the Ancient Greek word ἐπικρατής, meaning 'powerful', and the specific epithet \"inornatus\" is from the Latin negation of \"ornatus\", meaning 'adorned', thus the boa is 'unadorned'.\n\nA characteristic of this species are the irregular parietal scales. It can grow to some , with 261 to 271 ventral scales and 67 to 75 caudal scales, according to Stejneger in 1904, who only knew of at least twelve specimens at the time. The colours of the three live specimens he knew of were variable; two he describes as \"bistre\" (deep, dark, grayish brown), the other as \"chestnut\" with a darker colour near the tail, the first had a darker ventral surface, the second he describes as \"slate\" coloured, and the last had a lighter slate-brown underside with the ventral scales having paler edges. The first was patterned with seventy to eighty indistinct dusky cross bars consisting of a row of spots, these cross bars increasing in width to the end of the snake; in the second these patterns were much more distinct, with the crossbars having pale centres but being outlined in blackish colour, the lateral spots being so aligned as to form a blackish line in the front third of its body, but in the last snake there was little evidence of patterning with only a few scattered and obscure darkish spots on its sides. The iris he describes as \"silvery gray clouded with dusky\". \n\nIt grows to in total length.\n\nPuerto Rico has very few snakes for a Caribbean island of its size, besides this species there are \"Alsophis portoricensis\" and \"Arrhyton exiguum\" and a number of very small blindsnakes of the genus \"Typhlops\", and this is the largest species by far. The only other species of \"Epicrates\" in the area is \"Epicrates monensis\". In that species the supraocular scales are about one half as broad as the frontal scales, whereas in this species the supraoculars are about one third as broad as the frontal scales. \n\nThe Puerto Rican boa is endemic to the island of Puerto Rico. \n\nIt is found in wooded and rocky places in the foothills. It is more common in the northwest and in the karst regions which are found along the northern coast of the island.\n\nThe boa feeds by seizing the prey in its jaws, wrapping several coils around the victim, and then constricting until the prey has suffocated. The prey is then swallowed head first. The feeding habits of the very young are unknown. However, locals claim they eat small lizards, other small vertebrates and some insects.\n\nThis species is a sit-and-wait predator as opposed to an active hunter of prey. It is a nocturnal, terrestrial hunter which is not found often in trees. The dissections of 72 snakes from the West Indies show that while young boas of the genus \"Epicrates\" feed primarily on anoles, mature boas (with the exception of \"Epicrates gracilis\") feed for some 60% on mammals combined, which distinguishes them ecologically from the other three genera of snakes on the island. Birds constitute some 10% of the diet. The rest of the prey items are composed of \"Anolis\" lizards and a very small amount of frogs. They also prey on much larger-sized prey than the other snakes. Half of the mammals are non-native species of mice (\"Mus\") and rats (\"Rattus\"), it is suspected that the original prey was other small mammals such as \"Nesophontes\", \"Brotomys\" and \"Isolobodon\" before the introduction of these species. Bats constitute the other half. Newborn snakes may possibly feed on geckos. It is thought that this species in particular feeds less on anoles and more on birds, rodents and bats.\n\nSince the karst region where the Puerto Rican boa lives usually has many caves, the boa has the opportunity to feed on bats -a phenomenon which was previously seen in other \"Epicrates\" species. Observations in the 1980s revealed that boas capture the bats in flight by hanging at the opening of the cave, waiting until bats fly out of it. They then grab a bat with their jaws before killing it via constriction.\n\nPregnant females give birth to about 23-26 live boas.\n\nHistoric records, some dating back to the 18th century, indicate that during the first few centuries of Spanish colonization in Puerto Rico the boa was relatively abundant, and oil produced from the snake's fat was utilized extensively as an export (see snake oil). Impacts to the boa resulting from the oil trade were undoubtedly heightened by a concurrent reduction of habitat. Deforestation of the island began during this period and continued until, by the early 20th century, very little natural forest remained. Predation by the mongoose, introduced into Puerto Rico in the 19th century, has been postulated as a further cause for the boa's present status, but there is no direct evidence to support this idea. \n\nIn 1904 Stejneger mentions that during his time the snake was rather rare, he himself, as well as a number of other collecting parties in the newly acquired territory, were unable to see one during their expeditions on the island, although a trail of one was seen. Other collecting parties were able to collect five specimens in 1900 and in those first few years the island became a possession of the United States, and bring these to the mainland, almost doubling the specimens known at the time. In the previous century only six other specimens had been secured, these were all in Europe -one in Milan (used by Jan), one in Paris (studied by Duméril and Bibron from Bayamon, there was also a second specimen from Haiti, but this one is now thought to have been misidentified), two or more somewhere in Spain (those of Seoane supposedly from Mindanao), and the three original syntypes used by Reinhardt in Copenhagen.\n\nAfter the invasion and annexation of the territory by the United States a few years before Stejneger and numerous other Americans were able to collect on the island, there was a subsequent economic decline due of the loss of traditional agricultural markets for sugar, and much of the forests have regrown on the island. There is an indication that the boa has recovered somewhat in recent years, although not to the degree that protective measures can be dropped. To prevent its extinction, a few conservation efforts have been attempted, including a conservation area for it in Bosque Estatal San Patricio in Guaynabo.\n\n"}

{"id": "2221686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221686", "title": "Social marketing", "text": "Social marketing\n\nSocial marketing has the primary goal of achieving \"social good\". Traditional commercial marketing aims are primarily financial, though they can have positive social effects as well. In the context of public health, social marketing would promote general health, raise awareness and induce changes in behaviour. Social marketing has been a large industry for some time now and was originally done with newspapers and billboards, but similar to commercial marketing has adapted to the modern world. The most common use of social marketing in today's society is through social media.. However, to see social marketing as only the use of standard commercial marketing practices to achieve non-commercial goals is an oversimplified view. \n\nSocial marketing seeks to develop and integrate marketing concepts with other approaches to social change. Social marketing aims to influence behaviors that benefit individuals and communities for the greater social good. The goal is to deliver competition-sensitive and segmented social change programs that are effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable.\n\nIncreasingly, social marketing is described as having \"two parents.\" The \"social parent\" uses social science and social policy approaches. The \"marketing parent\" uses commercial and public sector marketing approaches. Recent years have also witnessed a broader focus. Social marketing now goes beyond influencing individual behaviour. It promotes socio-cultural and structural change relevant to social issues. Consequently, social marketing scholars are beginning to advocate for a broader definition of social marketing: \"social marketing is the application of marketing principles to enable individual and collective ideas and actions in the pursuit of effective, efficient, equitable, fair and sustained social transformation\".\nThe new emphasis gives equal weight to the effects (efficiency and effectiveness) and the process (equity, fairness and sustainability) of social marketing programs. Together with a new social marketing definition that focuses on social transformation, there is also an argument that \"a systems approach is needed if social marketing is to address the increasingly complex and dynamic social issues facing contemporary societies\"\n\nThe first documented evidence of the deliberate use of marketing to address a social issue comes from a 1963 reproductive health program led by K. T. Chandy at the Indian Institute of Management in Calcutta, India. Chandy and colleagues proposed, and subsequently implemented, a national family planning program with high quality, government brand condoms distributed and sold throughout the country at low cost. The program included an integrated consumer marketing campaign run with active point of sale promotion. Retailers were trained to sell the product aggressively, and a new organization was created to implement the program. In developing countries, the use of social marketing expanded to HIV prevention, control of childhood diarrhea (through the use of oral re-hydration therapies), malaria control and treatment, point-of-use water treatment, on-site sanitation methods and the provision of basic health services.\n\nHealth promotion campaigns began applying social marketing in practice in the 1980s. In the United States, The National High Blood Pressure Education Program and the community heart disease prevention studies in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and at Stanford University demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach to address population-based risk factor behaviour change. Notable early developments also took place in Australia. These included the Victoria Cancer Council developing its anti-tobacco campaign \"Quit\" (1988) and \"SunSmart\" (1988), its campaign against skin cancer which had the slogan \"Slip! Slop! Slap!\"\n\nSince the 1980s, the field has rapidly expanded around the world to include active living communities, disaster preparedness and response, ecosystem and species conservation, environmental issues, development of volunteer or indigenous workforces, financial literacy, global threats of antibiotic resistance, government corruption, improving the quality of health care, injury prevention, landowner education, marine conservation and ocean sustainability, patient-centered health care, reducing health disparities, sustainable consumption, transportation demand management, water treatment and sanitation systems and youth gambling problems, among other social needs (See).\n\nOn a wider front, by 2007, government in the United Kingdom announced the development of its first social marketing strategy for all aspects of health. In 2010, the US national health objectives included increasing the number of state health departments that report using social marketing in health promotion and disease prevention programs and increasing the number of schools of public health that offer courses and workforce development activities in social marketing.\n\nTwo other public health applications include the CDC's CDCynergy training and software application and SMART (Social Marketing and Assessment Response Tool) in the U.S.\n\nSocial marketing theory and practice has been progressed in several countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK, and in the latter a number of key government policy papers have adopted a strategic social marketing approach. Publications such as \"Choosing Health\" in 2004, \"It's our health!\" in 2006 and \"Health Challenge England\" in 2006, represent steps to achieve a strategic and operational use of social marketing. In India, AIDS controlling programs are largely using social marketing and social workers are largely working for it. Most of the social workers are professionally trained for this task.\n\nA variation of social marketing has emerged as a systematic way to foster more sustainable behavior. Referred to as community-based social marketing (CBSM) by Canadian environmental psychologist Doug McKenzie-Mohr, CBSM strives to change the behavior of communities to reduce their impact on the environment. Realizing that simply providing information is usually not sufficient to initiate behavior change, CBSM uses tools and findings from social psychology to discover the perceived barriers to behavior change and ways of overcoming these barriers. Among the tools and techniques used by CBSM are focus groups and surveys (to discover barriers) and commitments, prompts, social norms, social diffusion, feedback and incentives (to change behavior). The tools of CBSM have been used to foster sustainable behavior in many areas, including energy conservation, environmental regulation, recycling and litter cleanup\n\nIn recent years, the concept of strategic social marketing has emerged, which identifies that social change requires action at the individual, community, socio-cultural, political and environmental level, and that social marketing can and should influence policy, strategy and operational tactics to achieve pro-social outcomes.\n\nOther social marketing can be aimed at products deemed, at least by proponents, as socially unacceptable. One of the most notable is People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) which for many years has waged social marketing campaigns against the use of natural fur products. The campaigns' efficacy has been subject to dispute.\n\nNot all social marketing campaigns are effective everywhere. For example, anti-smoking campaigns such as World No Tobacco Day while being successful (in concert with government tobacco controls) in curbing the demand for tobacco products in North America and in parts of Europe, have been less effective in other parts of the world such as China, India and Russia. (See also: Prevalence of tobacco consumption)\nSocial marketing uses the benefits of doing social good to secure and maintain customer engagement. In social marketing the distinguishing feature is therefore its \"primary focus on social good, and it is not a secondary outcome. Not all public sector and not-for-profit marketing is social marketing.\n\nPublic sector bodies can use standard marketing approaches to improve the promotion of their relevant services and organizational aims. This can be very important but should not be confused with social marketing where the focus is on achieving specific behavioral goals with specific audiences in relation to topics relevant to social good (e.g., health, sustainability, recycling, etc.). For example, a 3-month marketing campaign to encourage people to get an H1N1 vaccine is more tactical in nature and should not be considered social marketing. A campaign that promotes and reminds people to get regular check-ups and all of their vaccinations when they're supposed to encourage a long-term behavior change that benefits society. It can, therefore, be considered social marketing.\n\nSocial marketing can be confused with commercial marketing. A commercial marketer may only seek to influence a buyer to purchase a product. Social marketers have more difficult goals. They want to make potentially difficult and long-term behavior changes in target populations, which may or may not involve purchasing a product. For example, reducing cigarette smoking or encouraging the use of condoms have difficult challenges to overcome that go beyond purchasing decisions.\n\nSocial marketing is sometimes seen as being restricted to a client base of non-profit organizations, health services groups, the government agency. However, the goal of inducing social change is not restricted to this narrow spectrum of organizations. Corporations, for example, can be clients. Public relations or social responsibility departments may champion social causes such as funding for the arts, which would involve social marketing.\n\nSocial marketing should not be confused with the societal marketing concept which was a forerunner of sustainable marketing in integrating issues of social responsibility into commercial marketing strategies. In contrast to that, social marketing uses commercial marketing theories, tools, and techniques to social issues.\n\nSocial marketing applies a \"customer-oriented\" approach and uses the concepts and tools used by commercial marketers in pursuit of social goals like anti-smoking campaigns or fundraising for NGOs.\n\nSocial marketers must create a competitive advantage by constantly adapting to and instigating change. With climate change in mind, adaptations to market changes are likely to be more successful if actions are guided by knowledge of the forces shaping market behaviors and insights that enable the development of sustainable competitive advantages.\n\nIn 2006, Jupitermedia announced its \"Social Marketing\" service, with which it aims to enable website owners to profit from social media. Despite protests from the social marketing communities over the perceived hijacking of the term, Jupiter stuck with the name. However, Jupiter's approach is more correctly (and commonly) referred to as social media optimization.\n\nMany scholars ascribe the beginning of the field of social marketing to an article published by G.D. Wiebe in the Winter 1951-1952 edition of \"Public Opinion Quarterly\". In it, Wiebe posed a rhetorical question: \"Why can’t you sell brotherhood and rational thinking like you can sell soap?” He then went on to discuss what he saw as the challenges of attempting to sell a social good as if it were a commodity, thus identifying social marketing (though he did not label it as such) as a discipline unique from c\nmmodity marketing. Yet, Wilkie & Moore (2003) note that the marketing discipline has been involved with questions about the intersection of marketing and society since its earliest days as a discipline.\n\nA decade later, organizations such as the KfW Entwicklungsbank in Germany, the Canadian International Development Agency, the Ministry for\nForeign Affairs in The Netherlands, UK Department for International Development, US Agency for International Development, World Health Organization and the World Bank began sponsoring social marketing interventions to improve family planning and achieve other social goals in Africa, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere.\n\nThe next milestone in the evolution of social marketing was the publication of \"Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change\" in the \"Journal of Marketing\" by Philip Kotler and Gerald Zaltman. Kotler and Zaltman coined the term 'social marketing' and defined it as \"the design, implementation, and control of programs calculated to influence the acceptability of social ideas and involving considerations of product planning, pricing, communication, distribution, and marketing research.\" They conclude that \"social marketing appears to represent a bridging mechanism which links the behavior scientist's knowledge of human behavior with the socially useful implementation of what that knowledge allows.\"\n\nCraig Lefebvre and June Flora introduced social marketing to the public health community in 1988, where it has been most widely used and explored. They noted that there was a need for \"large scale, broad-based, behavior change focused programs\" to improve public health (the community wide prevention of cardiovascular diseases in their respective projects) and outlined eight essential components of social marketing that still hold today:\n\nSpeaking of what they termed \"social change campaigns\", Kotler and Ned Roberto introduced the subject by writing, \"A social change campaign is an organized effort conducted by one group (the change agent) which attempts to persuade others (the target adopters) to accept, modify, or abandon certain ideas, attitudes, practices or behavior.\" Their 1989 text was updated in 2002 by Philip Kotler, Ned Roberto and Nancy Lee. In 2005, University of Stirling was the first university to open a dedicated research institute to Social Marketing, while in 2007, Middlesex University became the first university to offer a specialized postgraduate programme in Health & Social Marketing.\n\nIn recent years there has been an important development to distinguish between \"strategic social marketing\" and \"operational social marketing\".\n\nMuch of the literature and case examples focus on operational social marketing, using it to achieve specific behavioral goals in relation to different audiences and topics. However, there has been increasing efforts to ensure social marketing goes \"upstream\" and is used much more strategically to inform policy formulation and strategy development. Here the focus is less on specific audience and topic work but uses strong customer understanding and insight to inform and guide effective policy and strategy development. Social marketing in most cases stands in contrast to business marketing and serves for society wellbeing. The techniques of this marketing are used for change of attitudes and behaviours of different audiences in public life.\n\nSocial marketing is also being explored as a method for social innovation, a framework to increase the adoption of evidence-based practices among professionals and organizations, and as a core skill for public sector managers and social entrepreneurs. It is being viewed as an approach to design more effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable approaches to enhance social well-being that extends beyond individual behavior change to include creating positive shifts in social networks and social norms, businesses, markets and public policy.\n\nMany examples exist of social marketing research, with over 120 papers compiled in a six volume set.). For example, research now shows ways to reduce the intentions of people to binge drink or engage in dangerous driving. Martin, Lee, Weeks and Kaya (2013) suggests that understanding consumer personality and how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of the harmful effects of binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense of who they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person's close friends.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2221688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221688", "title": "Gay cruising in England and Wales", "text": "Gay cruising in England and Wales\n\nGay cruising describes the act of searching about a public place in pursuit of a partner for sex. The activity has existed in England and Wales since at least the 17th century and has a colourful legal history. It differs from prostitution in that the parties involved do not seek money for sex, and from gay nightclubs or bathhouses in that they are not on private premises, although they may take place on private land to which the public have been granted access.\n\nThe history of gay cruising is sparsely documented, as the illegality of gay sex meant that those who used such cruising grounds were likely to be discreet about them. Rictor Norton, author of \"Mother Clap's Molly House\" (a reference to Margaret Clap), is one of the few historians to address the topic. He believes that the first gay cruising grounds and gay brothels in London may have sprung up in the early 17th century; theatres were sometimes denounced as such by moralists of the time.\n\nSo-called \"cruising grounds\" or \"cruising sites\", where gay and bisexual men meet at a public place to cruise for sex, originated in the late 1600s (from the earliest known records, although it most likely originated much earlier) and has continued to the present day. Cruising came about owing to the illegality of homosexual acts in the United Kingdom. Prior to the Sexual Offences Act 1967, this illegality meant that many gay men could not live openly as homosexuals. Cruising provided a way for gay men to solicit sexual encounters while minimizing the risk of being caught by the police. When cruising first became known, it usually took place in public fields, parks, toilets (or \"cottages\" as they would become known as in the 20th century). In more recent times, public lay-bys located either on or off main roads or rural roads have also become popular sites.\nGay beat is an Australian term.\n\nBefore the 20th century, anal sex, whether conducted in public or private, was illegal under sodomy laws, including the Buggery Act set down by Henry VIII in 1533. The penalty for anal intercourse during most of this period was death; however, specific proof of successful anal penetration was required for this verdict to be brought. The lesser crime of \"gross indecency\" carried penalties including the pillory (as in the case of the Vere Street Coterie, who were arrested in a raid of a gay club in 1811), transportation and imprisonment.\n\nThe death penalty for anal sex was lifted in 1861. An 1885 law prohibited \"gross indecency\", which included all erotic conduct between men. Eventually, in 1967, some of the Wolfenden Report's recommendations of a decade earlier led to the decriminalisation of homosexual sex in private; no such legal privilege pertains to sex in public places, either for homosexual or heterosexual sex. Therefore, despite more tolerance in the law and society at large, gay men have continued to be at risk of prosecution for public sex. \n\nA number of well known people have been arrested for sex in public places in England and Wales, including:\n\nThe playwright Joe Orton wrote in his posthumously published diaries of his regular cottaging, but he did not incur prosecution.\n\n lists a number of London cruising grounds during the Georgian era. These included St. James's Park, Moorfields, the public privies at Lincoln's Inn, and Smithfield prior to the Gordon Riots.\n\nHampstead Heath in north London has a long history of gay cruising, which was accompanied by police arrests and attacks. From the late 1990s, this evolved into minimal active policing, and support from gay sexual health organisations. During an interview on BBC News 24, the singer George Michael, who was allegedly caught cruising on Hampstead Heath by \"News of the World\" photographers, claimed that his cruising was \"de facto\" private because it occurred at 2am. In 1992, Conservative MP Alan Amos resigned his parliamentary seat after he was found by the police \"engaging in a homosexual act\" on the Heath.\n\nClapham Common in south London is well-known for gay cruising. The Labour MP Ron Davies resigned from the government after national newspapers reported that he was attacked and robbed by a man whom he met on the Common. A number of homophobic attacks have occurred around the area, including the murder of Jody Dobrowski. The gay-themed TV drama \"Clapham Junction\" was based around the lives of gay men in the area and included scenes of cruising and cottaging.\n\nThe Sexual Offences Act 2003 prohibits all forms of sexual activity in a public lavatory, but has nothing to say about other forms of cruising. However, persons of any gender who engage in sexual intercourse in public can find themselves charged with offences under the Public Order Act 1986, if the police have sufficient evidence to convince a court of law that the activity was witnessed by a third party, or there was a high likelihood of the activity being witnessed by a third party.\n\nPresently, there is an active population of men who visit cruising grounds, which include parks, picnic areas and lay-bys where sex takes place in the bushes or other sheltered areas. These areas exist in all parts of Britain, including isolated rural areas. The attitude of the police to cruising at any given location varies, according to the time of the day or night, and the level of public concern measured by the number of complaints from local residents and councillors. Occasionally, police community support officers will visit a cruising area during the early hours of the morning with the intention of advising cruisers of the risk of homophobic attacks, and any persons seen to be involved in sexual behavior will be asked to move on rather than being arrested. A number of police forces actively participate in on-line discussions with cruisers in order to gather information on hate crimes and to discourage them from using locations about which complaints have been received.\n\nThe current trend for gay cruising has been bolstered by a continued use of online media. Apps and websites including Grindr, Cruizerz.com and Squirt.org make arranged cruising possible, although this has been a source of questionable safety, with Russian gangs having been found to use such media to lure gay men into dangerous situations.\n\n"}

The Panorama was phased out in 1986 to give its market to Elba/Duna Weekend.\n\nSome current cars available in that market were the Volkswagen Brasilia, Volkswagen Variant, Ford Belina and Chevrolet Caravan. Some time later, there were Chevrolet Marajó (end of 1980) and Volkswagen Parati (1982).\n\nThe mechanicals of the 147 were adapted for a heavier weight. The appeal of Panorama was the economy of space and fuel. The length was the smaller of all Brazilian wagons (3924 mm/154 in) but the internal space was equivalent to the bigger ones. In order to create more room space, the spare tire was placed along with the engine, as in 147. The light weight allowed a small fuel consumption either of gasoline or alcohol.\n\nIt was sold in three engine options: a 1048 cc gasoline with a maximum output of 56 hp (42 kW) and a 1297 cc gasoline or alcohol with a maximum output of 60 hp (45 kW) and 61 hp (46 kW) respectively.

He is best known for his powerful soulful voice and his energetic virtuosity on the Hammond organ, peaking in 1971 with his Top 10 pop hit single, \"Do You Know What I Mean\".\n\nMichaels began his career with The Sentinals, a San Luis Obispo, California-based surf group that included drummer Johny Barbata (later of The Turtles, Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship). Michaels joined Barbata in the Joel Scott Hill Trio, a group led by guitarist Joel Scott Hill. Michaels later moved to San Francisco, where he joined an early version of The Family Tree, a band led by Bob Segarini. In 1967, he signed a contract with A&M Records, releasing his debut album, \"Carnival of Life,\" later that year with David Potter on drums. As a session musician, he played with Jimi Hendrix, among others.\n\nMichaels' choice of the Hammond organ as his primary instrument was unusual for the time, as was his bare-bones stage and studio accompaniment: usually just a single drummer, most often a musician known as \"Frosty,\" real name Bartholomew Eugene Smith-Frost, who was a member of Sweathog, and whose bare handed technique was an inspiration for John Bonham, or with Joel Larson of The Grass Roots. This unorthodox approach attracted a following in San Francisco, and some critical notice. (\"Sounds Magazine,\" for one, reported of Michaels that he had been called \"the ultimate power organist.\") But Michaels did not achieve real commercial success until the release of his fifth album.\n\nThat album, titled \"5th\" and released in 1971, produced a surprise US Top 10 hit (#6 in the fall of 1971), \"Do You Know What I Mean.\" It was an autobiographical homage to the loss of a girlfriend. Michaels's Top 40 follow-up, a cover version of the Motown standard, \"Can I Get a Witness,\" peaked at #39 on Christmas Day of 1971, eight years to the week after Marvin Gaye's version peaked at #22. \"Billboard\" ranked \"Do You Know What I Mean\" as the No. 19 song for 1971. Michaels recorded two more albums for A&M before signing a recording contract with Columbia Records in 1973. But his Columbia recordings failed to generate much interest, and Michaels had gone into semi-retirement from the music industry by the end of the decade.\n\nIn 1991, Michaels obtained full rights to all of his A&M recordings in a settlement of disputes that had arisen from A&M granting licenses to Delicious Vinyl for the use of Michaels's recordings by means of digital sampling on several Young MC recordings. Once he had regained full ownership rights, Michaels granted licenses to Rhino Records and Shout Factory to release several \"best of\" albums over the years. In November 2015, Manifesto Records released his entire catalog of A&M recordings on compact disc and vinyl in February 2016.\n\n"}

Their sound blended light rock with elements of collegiate vocal harmony and jazz\n\nThe Castells were formed at Santa Rosa High School around 1959. They were booked for a performance at a local teenage \"canteen\". They did not have a name and their pianist, Jeff Bush, suggested one. It had no meaning other than they thought that it sounded good, and the intent was to be more thoughtful and change it later.\n\nThrough a Santa Rosa KJAX disc jockey who went by the name of Dan Dillon, they got Hollywood contacts. Girard's mother financed a demo for a hundred dollars, which was recorded in a San Francisco studio. They took their demo and went door-to-door in Hollywood, first to Crystalette Records, which seemed to be defunct, Aladdin Records, and then Era Records. They were excited that Aladdin seemed interested, as they considered themselves to be R&B, but eventually it was Era who signed them.\n\nTheir first release \"Little Sad Eyes\", went to \"Bubbling Under\" on the \"Billboard\" chart, then came \"Sacred\", which reached the charts. \"Make Believe Wedding\" went \"Bubbling Under\", then \"So This Is Love\" again charted. They played shows for a few years, and share the stage with Jackie Wilson, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bobby Vee, and Brenda Lee. They never charted again but did continue to record for a few years, first for Warner Bros. Records and then Decca Records. They disbanded around 1964. Chuck Girard later joined the surf rock group The Hondells and in the 1970s became a popular CCM artist.\n\nThe band's members were Chuck Girard, Tom Hicks, Warren Hays, Bob Ussery, and Jeff Bush. Bush didn't sing. He played piano on all the gigs. Hays left when the group was signed by Era Records. The group planned to move from Santa Rosa to southern California. Hays, a minor, was not allowed to move with the boys, and his parents also objected on religious grounds. When Hays left, Joe Kelly replaced him. When the group signed with Era Records, label president Herb Newman insisted on session pianists, and Jeff Bush was edged out.\n\nIn 1963 Bob Ussery got married, left the group, and moved out of California. He was temporarily replaced by Greg Van Krugel, Chuck Girard's roommate and high school friend, because he knew the material from attending rehearsals. After a few live performances as a substitute, he was elected to permanent membership. By late 1964, The Castells were still recording and doing public appearances, but their popularity was waning. By 1965 the group members remained friends and went their separate ways.\n\nMost often produced by Gary Usher of surf & hot rod rock fame, Chuck Girard and Joe Kelly went on to record as a duo under their real names, Chuck and Joe, recording blue-eyed soul covers of earlier popular songs like \"Harlem Shuffle\" and \"Feel So Fine.\" They recorded a few edgy pop-folk singles as the Devons. They worked for Usher for several years and recorded a number of hot rod and surf albums under many different group identities.\n\nTom Hicks began a family with a new wife and went on to become a successful businessman in southern California.\n\nGreg Van Krugel also married. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1966. In 1968, after active duty, he returned to his wife and daughter in southern California and made his career in the defense and aerospace electronics industry.\n\nOther performers of note with which the Castells shared the stage include Bobby Rydell, Dick and Dee Dee, Jan and Dean, The Beach Boys, The Righteous Brothers. The Rivingtons, Donnie Brooks, Dobie Gray, Gary Lewis & The Playboys, Ted Neely and Larry Verne.\n\nSession musicians the Castells worked with later became known as \"The Wrecking Crew\". They included Billy Strange (guitar), Barney Kessel (guitar), Ray Pohlman (bass & arranger of one of the group's sessions), Frankie Capp, Plas Johnson (saxophone), Glen Campbell (guitar), and Hal Blaine (drums).\n\n\n"}

Armstrong later served as Lord Mayor of Sydney from 1965 to 1967, and then as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1973 to 1974.\n\nArmstrong was born into a large Roman Catholic family in the Sydney suburb of Ultimo to William and Ellen (née Hannan) Armstrong, both emigrants from Ireland. He was educated at St Bede's School, Pyrmont, and at the Marist Brothers' High School, Darlinghurst. In 1934, he was elected as an alderman of Sydney Municipal Council, representing the Labor Party until 1948.\n\nArmstrong was selected for Labor's slate of candidates for the Australian Senate for the 1937 election partly because his name would appear high on the alphabetic ballot and he was duly elected, effective from July 1938. He married Joan Therese Josephine Curran in October 1945.\n\nDuring 1945, Prime Minister John Curtin's health greatly deteriorated but politicians and the media declined to publicly discuss Curtin's health for fear of concerning the Australian public during World War II. As a result, Armstrong gave a speech in the Senate on 13 June which included the first public reference to Curtin's health, and left the Australian public surprised.\n\nHe was appointed Minister for Munitions in Ben Chifley's November 1946 ministry. In April 1948, his portfolio was merged with the Supply functions of Bill Ashley's portfolio to create the portfolio of Supply and Development and he was attacked by the opposition for the breadth of his powers. Following Labor's defeat at the 1949 election, he became deputy-leader of the Opposition in the Senate. He was relegated to an unwinnable fourth position on Labor's ticket for the 1961 election and left parliament in July 1962.\n\nArmstrong was elected Lord Mayor of Sydney in 1966, but the position was abolished by the Askin government in 1967.

It is headquartered at Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson, Alaska.\n\n11 AF plans, conducts, controls and coordinates air operations in accordance with the tasks assigned by the commander, Pacific Air Forces, and is the force provider for Alaskan Command, the Alaska North American Aerospace Defense Command Region and other unified commanders.\n\nEstablished on 28 December 1941 as the Alaskan Air Force at Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory. 11 AF was a United States Army Air Forces combat air force in the American Theater of World War II, providing air defense of Alaska and engaging in combat operations primarily in the Aleutian Islands and Northern Pacific during the Aleutian Islands Campaign.\n\nRe-designated as Alaskan Air Command in late 1945, the organization became responsible for the air defense of Alaska during the Cold War. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the organization was realigned under PACAF in 1990 and returned to its previous Numbered Air Force command echelon.\n\nThe commander of the Eleventh Air Force also serves as the commander of United States Northern Command's sub-unified Alaskan Command, and as commander of the Alaskan North American Aerospace Defense Command Region.\nThis mission is accomplished largely through the PACAF Regional Support Center (PRSC), the 611th Air and Space Operations Center, and units of the Alaska Air National Guard (AKANG). Together, they provide a network of critical air surveillance and command, control and communications functions necessary to perform tactical warning and attack assessment in defense of Alaska.\n\n\nThe 11th Air Force has two major units that are gained upon their activation. These units are part of the Alaska Air National Guard.\n\nMilitary aircraft began flying in Alaska in 1920 when the Black Wolf Squadron, or The Alaska Flying Expedition, made The New York to Nome Flight. Capt. St. Clair Streett commanded 7 men in 4 DH-4s as they took off from Mitchel Field on 17 July 1920. Each plane had a black profile of a Wolf's head painted on their sides. The trip organizer, Billy Mitchell wanted to establish an airway to Alaska and Asia. The 9349 mile round trip route included flying west to North Dakota, then north through Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, the Yukon, and onwards to Fairbanks on 19 Aug. and finally Nome on the 23rd. They started their return trip on the 31st, landing Mitchel Field on 20 Oct. 1920 after 112 flying hours.\n\nIn 1924, the around the world flight by the Army using Douglas \"World Cruiser\"s also transited though Alaska. However, the first permanently based military aircraft began to deploy to Alaska during the last half of 1940 after the breakout of World War II in Europe and tensions began to deteriorate with Japan. To coordinate air activities there, the Alaskan Defense Command established the Air Field Forces, Alaskan Defense Command on 29 May 1941.\n\nEarly in 1940, the question of air defense of the Alaska Territory came into the limelight when President Roosevelt pointed out in his message to Congress requesting funds for fortification of Guam and Wake Islands and other strategic points in the Pacific that airfields were needed in Alaska. The original request for $12,000,000 to be appropriated for the construction of Alaskan defenses was cut to $600,000, but still was sufficient to begin the construction of an air base at Anchorage, Alaska. Thus was begun the construction of Elmendorf Field, primary fourth-echelon base for all future Eleventh Air Force operations. Construction of the airfield began on 8 June when 25 locally hired men began clearing brush, the Army intending it to be a permanent airfield.\n\nThe first \"troops\" of the Alaskan Air Force advance echelon to arrive in Alaska included a six-year-old Martin B-10 on 12 August 1940. On 12 December the Army designated the base Fort Richardson and flying field Elmendorf Field. The post was named for Brig Gen Wilds P. Richardson, former head of the Alaska Road Commission; the airfield and flying facilities were named Elmendorf Field in honor of Captain Hugh M. Elmendorf, killed in 1933 while flight testing an experimental fighter near Wright Field, Ohio.\n\nThe first Air Corps unit to be assigned to Alaska was the 18th Pursuit Squadron, which transferred to Elmendorf from Hamilton Army Airfield, California on 21 February 1941 with Curtiss P-40 Warhawks. The 23d Air Base Group was assigned shortly afterwards to provide base support. The 36th Bombardment Squadron arrived less than a month later from Lowry Field, Colorado, equipped with Douglas B-18 Bolo medium bombers.\n\nA major problem was the training of personnel and the preparing of equipment for operation in the cold Alaskan climate. Mechanical things showed unusual behavior at 40 degrees below zero. Oil became almost solid, metal and rubber brittle and fractured easily. At the same time, Texas-trained pilots had to learn to fly in a country where sudden fogs could close out airports in less than 10 minutes and high-velocity \"williwaws\" could tear the wings off combat planes.\n\nThe first months activities of the new command were spent in reconnaissance for a rim of defense bases. The hub of this defense \"wheel\" was to be at Elmendorf Field near Anchorage. In the meantime, plans for the establishment of bases were moving slowly. Certain planned fields had to be constructed in summer, because the severe Alaskan frost in winter made construction impossible, but equipment for the construction of fields north of Nome and around Anchorage failed to arrive, and construction was postponed until the following summer. Construction had been completed, however, on two important coastal fields in southeastern Alaska, Annette Army Airfield at Annette Island and Yakutat Army Airfield at Yakutat, and the first direct all-weather air route to Alaska from Seattle was open.\n\nAn extremely fortunate accident took place in October 1941, which possibly changed the whole course of World War II in Alaska. Equipment for the construction of a CAA-DLA (Civil Aeronautics Authority-Defense Land Appropriation) airfield at McGrath, on the mainland, arrived too late to begin construction of the field, since the ground already had become frozen, and General Buckner requested and received permission to divert the equipment and men to Cold Bay on the Alaskan Peninsula and Otter Point on Umnak Island, to build two airfields for the defense of the Naval Base at Dutch Harbor. To conceal their purpose, both fields were organized as ostensible business enterprises concerned with fishing and canning. The two cover names were: \"Blair Packing Company\" and \"Saxton & Company\", whose peculiar canning equipment consisted of bulldozers, power shovels and similar construction equipment. The top holding-company for these enterprises was the \"Consolidated Packing Company\" of Anchorage, known in military circles as the Alaskan Defense Command. Security was complete. Japanese intelligence never learned of the existence of these airfields and the Japanese tactical decisions were based on the assumption that their attack on Dutch Harbor would not be opposed by land-based aircraft.\n\nAll through the winter of 1941–1942, men worked at the construction of these two air bases, and by spring, two 5,000-foot airstrips were completed, one at Cold Bay (Fort Randall Army Airfield), the other at Otter Point on Umnak (Fort Glenn Army Airfield). Another vital factor in the construction of the Umnak field was the use of perforated steel matting. No other medium could have been used to build that runway in the time required, since Umnak has no natural construction material. The matting was laid over a graded gash in the tundra and set the pattern for the construction of future Aleutian runways.\nAdministratively speaking, the Eleventh Air Force also was born in that winter of 1941–1942. First conceived as the Air Force, Alaskan Defense Command, it emerged as an integral unit as the Alaskan Air Force on 15 January 1942, and was redesignated the Eleventh Air Force on 5 February. In May 1942, a field headquarters was established at Fort Morrow Army Airfield, Port Heiden, Alaska, and planes of the 73d Bombardment Squadron were deployed at Fort Randall Army Airfield, Cold Bay and the 21st Bombardment Squadron at Fort Glenn Army Airfield, Umnak.\n\nLadd Field near Fairbanks became a secondary major air base in Alaska. It was named after Major Arthur K. Ladd, killed in a flying accident near Dale, South Carolina on 13 December 1935. Unlike Elmendorf, Ladd Field came the jurisdiction of Ferrying Command, which was a part of the Lend-Lease Program. Through Lend-Lease, the United States transferred nearly 8,000 aircraft to the Soviet Union though Ladd Field during the course of World War II. The aircraft were flown into Ladd from Great Falls Airfield, Montana by American civilian aircrews; Soviet crews then flew the planes west through Nome (Marks Field) and on to Siberia. The pilots leaving Great Falls flew along a route of small airfields that became known as the Northwest Staging Route. One of those airfields, Big Delta Army Airfield, southeast of Fairbanks, became Fort Greely.\n\nIn mid-1942 the Imperial Japanese Navy laid plans to attack Alaska in conjunction with an attack on Midway Island in the central Pacific. The Japanese Northern Area Fleet's attacks on Dutch Harbor and Adak Island resulted in the Aleutian Islands Campaign. But because United States Naval intelligence had broken the Japanese naval cypher code, Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief Pacific Ocean Areas in Hawaii, learned of Japanese plans by 21 May 1942. As of 1 June 1942, United States military strength in Alaska stood at 45,000 men. On that day the XI Intercepter Command, activated earlier, in March, was redesignated the XI Fighter Command. However, Eleventh Air Force operational strength was small. It consisted of 10 B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers and 34 B-18 Bolo medium bombers at Elmendorf Airfield, and 95 P-40 Warhawk fighters divided between Fort Randall AAF at Cold Bay and Fort Glenn AAF on Umnak.\n\nWhen the first inklings of a possible Japanese attack on the Aleutian Islands were known, the Eleventh Air Force was ordered to send out reconnaissance aircraft to locate the Japanese fleet reported heading toward Dutch Harbor and attack it with bombers, concentrating on sinking Hosogaya's two aircraft carriers. Once the enemy planes were removed, Task Force 8 of the Navy would engage the enemy fleet and destroy it. On the afternoon of 2 June a naval patrol plane spotted the approaching Japanese fleet, reporting its location as 800 miles southwest of Dutch Harbor. Eleventh Air Force was placed on full alert. Shortly thereafter bad weather set in, and no further sightings of the fleet were made that day.\n\nThe first aerial bombing of the American continent during World War II took place on 3 and 4 June 1942, when two Japanese raids were made on the Dutch Harbor in the city of Unalaska, Alaska. While the first did little damage, the second destroyed the base's oil storage tanks, part of the hospital, and damaged a beached barracks ship. Although American pilots had finally located the Japanese carriers, attempts to destroy them proved fruitless. As bad weather again set in, all contact with the enemy fleet was lost.\n\nIn all, the Japanese raid claimed 43 U.S. lives, of which 33 were soldiers. Another 64 Americans were wounded. Eleven U.S. planes were downed, while the Japanese lost ten aircraft. During the two-day fight, Naval Task Force 8 had remained south of Kodiak Island, taking no part in the action. On 5 June, it received a report of enemy warships in the Bering Sea heading south toward Unalaska Island, which was interpreted to be a landing force intent upon seizing Dutch Harbor. While Task Force 8 entered the Bering Sea, Hosogaya's fleet moved south to join Yamamoto, who had just suffered the loss of his four large carriers at the Battle of Midway.\n\nBy mid-June the Joint Chiefs of Staff theorized that the attack on the Aleutian Islands and the occupation of its westernmost islands might be part of a holding action designed to screen a northward thrust by Japanese forces into Siberia's maritime provinces and the Kamchatka Peninsula. As a result of their concern about a possible Japanese attack upon the Soviet Union that might also include the occupation of St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea and of nearby Nome and its adjacent airfields on the Alaskan mainland.\n\nSupporting the possibility of an invasion of the Alaskan mainland were reports of a Japanese fleet operating in the Bering Sea. Three separate sightings placed an enemy fleet somewhere between the Pribilof and St. Lawrence Islands, suggesting that either an enemy raid on or an outright invasion of the Alaskan mainland was imminent, with Nome the likely objective. As a result, within thirty-six hours, Eleventh Air Force using commandeered civilian aircraft flew nearly 2,300 troops to Nome, along with artillery and antiaircraft guns and several tons of other equipment and supplies. Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers of the 404th Bombardment Squadron were sent to the Air Transport Command Marks Army Airfield with a mission to locate and attack the Japanese Fleet.\n\nNot until late July when United States intelligence reported with some certainty the departure of Hosogaya's fleet from the Bering Sea did the threat of invasion of the Alaskan mainland decline, allowing for the redeployment of many of the troops hastily assembled at Nome.\n\nOn 30 August 1942, in the face of a howling gale, American Army troops went ashore on Adak Island, some 250 miles east of Kiska. Adak affords a good fleet anchorage, a sheltered harbor and as was revealed later, a superlative site for quick construction of an airfield. The 807th Army Aviation Engineering Battalion set to work constructing a dike and draining the tidal flat between Kuluk Bay and the Sweeper Cove areas to create an airfield. Only ten days later engineers built a runway, and on 10 September the first aircraft, a B-18, landed at \"Longview Army Airfield\". Three days later there were 15 B-24s, a B-17, 15 P-38s and 16 P-39s on the island. On 12 September, the first air attack from Adak, consisting of 12 B-24s, 14 P-38s and 14 P-39s, was launched under the command of Major John S. Chennault of the 343d Fighter Group. The attack was launched against Japanese positions on Kiska. The airfield on Adak was renamed \"Davis Army Airfield\" in honor of Colonel Everett S. Davis, the first Commander, Eleventh Air Force, killed in an aircraft accident on 28 November 1942.\n\nThroughout the winter of 1942–1943, the Eleventh Air Force bombed Kiska and Attu whenever possible, although the flyers were extremely handicapped by the almost constant fog which covered the island. At the same time, the bases to the east of Adak were consolidated and built up. In October, the Field Headquarters of the Eleventh Air Force was closed at Kodiak and moved to Davis AAF.\n\nOn 11 January 1943, American Army troops went ashore on the unoccupied Amchitka Island, barely 75 statute miles from Kiska, and a month later, on 16 February, the first aircraft, a P-38 and a P-40, landed on Amchitka Army Airfield, a quickly-built airstrip. The first mission against Kiska was flown on 18 February.\n\nBy March, both medium and heavy bombers could make the short hop from Amchitka to Kiska and on good days, rare enough, crews flew as many as four and occasionally six sorties per day. It was said that the Japanese needed no air warning system on Kiska, because they could hear the Eleventh Air Force bombers warming up on Amchitka, and knew from the sound of the engines when the raids were taking off.\n\nThroughout this period, the striking power of the Eleventh Air Force included only three squadrons of medium bombers, three squadrons of heavies and four squadrons of fighters. An additional squadron of P-39 Airacobras operated in the Aleutian theater for a short while, but their light landing gear was unsatisfactory for use on the rough fields and they were returned to the States.\n\nTactically, the Eleventh Air Force was operating under the jurisdiction of the Navy, since Alaska was still in the situation of a \"fleet-opposed invasion\". The air arm, designated Task Force \"X\", was commanded by General Butler, and included the Air Striking Group (Eleventh Air Force) and the Air Search Group (Naval Fleet Air Wing Four). Overall command was vested in Vice Admiral Thomas Kinkaid, Commander, North Pacific Force, abbreviated to ComNorPacFor or ComNorPac.\n\nOn 1 April, a plan to by-pass Kiska and capture Attu was presented to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was approved, and on 11 May, American troops went ashore on Attu. In a short and fierce battle, the Japanese garrison was wiped out, and on 29 May, the island was declared secure. The first plane, a hospital C-47, landed on a newly completed runway at Alexai Point Army Airfield, Attu, on 7 June. The operation against Attu also included the occupation of the Semichi Islands, an archipelago of three tiny bits of land some 35 miles east of Attu. The flattest of these, Shemya, was to be the site of the most important American air base for future operations. Barely four miles long and only two miles wide, Shemya Army Airfield became, literally, a stationary aircraft carrier. These islands were taken without opposition, on 29 May.\n\nWith Kiska cut off by the occupation of Attu, the Japanese made plans to evacuate the Aleutian Islands. Numerous sorties were made by the Japanese Fifth Fleet, based at Paramushiru, but finally on 28 July, under cover of a thick fog, destroyers were able to enter Kiska Harbor and remove all occupation troops. When American troops went ashore on 15 August, the island was deserted, ending the Aleutian Campaign.\n\nSix million pounds of bombs had been dropped on Kiska and Attu in Eleventh Air Force operations. The Japanese had been prevented from building an air field and from bringing in reinforcements. 'Rufe' seaplane fighters were shot out of the air as soon as they came up to give combat. Air Force fighters and bombers had played an instrumental part in driving Japanese out of the Aleutian Islands. Illustrative of the challenges omnipresent in Alaska, only 35 aircraft were lost in combat compared to 150 operational accidents. It was the highest American combat-to-accidental loss ratio for any theater in World War II. Weather was the prime culprit. The Eleventh Air Force accounted for approximately 60 Japanese aircraft, one destroyer, one submarine and seven transport ships destroyed by air operations.\n\nWith the Aleutian Campaign completed, the Eleventh Air Force had the following units reassigned to other combat areas between 20 August and 1 September: the 21st Bombardment Squadron (Heavy), 36th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy), 73d Bombardment Squadron (Medium), 406th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) and the 407th Bombardment Squadron (Dive Bomber).\n\nMore than a month before the unopposed landing on Kiska, the Eleventh Air Force began a new phase of operations against the Japanese. On 10 July 1943, six Eleventh Air Force B-25 Mitchells made the long flight to Paramushiru Island in the Kuriles and made the first direct attack on the Japanese home islands since the famous Doolittle raid in April 1942. From Alexai Point AAF on Attu, eight Mitchells of the 77th Bomb Squadron. (28th BG) struck Paramushiro bases principally. All returned safely.\n\nA week later, B-24 Liberator heavy bombers from Attu bombed the Kuriles and secured pictures of the Japanese installations, the first pictures taken of northern Japan home-island defenses. The next Kurile raid, carried out on 11 August, was a diversionary raid prior to the landings on Kiska. On this mission, the first plane was lost over the Kuriles and Lieutenant James C. Pottenger and his crew made a forced landing in Russia.\n\nThese operations led to a joint mission on 11 September 1943, when Eleventh Air Force dispatched eight B-24 Liberators and 12 B-25s. However the Japanese were alert and reinforced their defenses. 74 crew members in three B-24s and seven B-25 failed to return. Twenty two men were killed in action, one taken prisoner and 51 interned in Kamchatka, Russia. It had proven that the Kurile Islands could be attacked, but new methods had to be devised as the raid lost Eleventh Air Force over half its offensive striking power. No more combat missions were flown in 1943.\n\nSeveral changes took place following the occupation of Kiska. The Eleventh Air Force became a component of Task Force \"Y\", still under Navy jurisdiction. Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher was named ComNorPac and Major General Davenport Johnson relieved General Butler as commander of the Eleventh Air Force. One of General Johnson's first acts was the establishment of the Eleventh Air Force Instrument flying school and the promotion of an intensive training program in navigation and instrument flying, as well as the accelerated development of radio and navigation aids in the Aleutian Islands. Because of the tremendous advances brought about by intensive instrument training and the increased aids to navigation and radio, planes that used to be grounded by weather, were now flying regular schedules. Troop Carrier Command and Air Transport Command planes were operating in the Aleutian Islands with airline regularity.\n\nIn November 1943 a second airfield, Casco Cove Army Airfield was constructed on Attu for long-range bombing operations.\nEleventh Air Force carried out another bombing mission against northern Kurils on 5 February 1944, when it attacked with six B-24s from the 404th Bomb Sqdn. (28th BG) and 16 P-38s from the 54th Fighter Sqdn. (343d FG). March 1944 saw Eleventh Air Force bombers over the Kuriles on daylight armed reconnaissance missions. Not many, but a sufficient number to convince the Japanese that there were aircraft in the Aleutian Islands and that the Kuriles were in constant danger of air attack. During the crucial period, while other United States forces were advancing in the South Pacific, the Japanese were forced to keep much-needed aircraft, in the Kuriles and Hokkaido as defense against possible attack from the North.\n\nOperations against Northern Japan became the new mission of the Eleventh Air Force, and it was being successfully carried out. Except for July 1944, when the weather was especially bad, each month of 1944 showed a steady increase in operations against the Kuriles. Each month's record showed planes turned back short of their targets, weather again protecting the Japanese. Often, too, B-24 Liberator bomb loads were dropped through the undercast by aid of the newly installed radar bombing equipment, a far cry from the timed runs made on the Kiska main camp area using the Kiska volcano as an initial point when the target was closed in. The record month, June 1945, for the Eleventh Air Force showed a record number of tons of bombs dropped.\n\nThe B-25 Mitchell medium bombers, too, were playing their part in operations against the Kuriles. They had been kept on shipping alert since the abortive 11 September raid, but in May, two planes on a gasoline consumption test west of Attu, discovered and sank two armed Japanese trawlers. From that time on, the Mitchells, made sweeps against shipping when weather permitted, and by fall were bombing land targets in the Kuriles.\n\nAlthough Eleventh Air Force was engaged in combat during the Aleutian Campaign, the command also supported the Lend-Lease transport of aircraft though Alaska to the Soviet Union by Air Transport Command beginning in September 1942. Lend-Lease aircraft were ferried from Great Falls Army Air Base, Montana to Ladd Field by the 7th Ferrying Group (Later Alaskan Wing), ATC. The United States manufactured aircraft were turned over to Red Air Force pilots at Ladd Field, and from there the Soviet pilots would fly to Marks Army Airfield, near Nome as a final refueling and maintenance stop on-route to Uel'kal', Siberia. From Siberia, the aircraft were flown westward across the Soviet Union (Uelkal-Krasnoyarsk route) to the combat areas in Russia for use against Nazi forces. Eleventh Air Force aircraft were also ferried up the NWSR, with the aircraft being flown to Elmendorf from RCAF Station Whitehorse. More than 8,000 airplanes were delivered over the route. Most were Bell Airacobras and Kingcobras, along with A-20s, B-25s and C-47s. ATC personnel were based at Edmonton as well as other Canadian bases.\n\nA lesser-known part of the aircraft ferrying mission for ATC pilots was search and rescue for Ferrying Command pilots and crews who were forced down in the remote wilderness. The ATC Alaska Wing was equipped with a number of single-engine C-64 \"Norseman\" light transports, which were equipped alternatively with pontoons, skis and wheels, depending the season. The C-64s were used to resupply stations along the Canadian pipeline as well as for search and rescue work.\n\nATC also developed two transport routes to Alaska during the war to support Eleventh Air Force. The first was from McChord Field, near Seattle, Washington north along the British Columbia coastline to Annette Island, then to Yakutat and into Elmendorf AFB. The second was developed to support the Aleutian Campaign and was built as American forces moved westward along the island chain. It started in Anchorage and went through Nannek Airfield then to Point Heiden, Cold Bay and along the Aleutian Islands until reaching Shemya and Attu Islands in 1944. These transport routes ferried personnel, along with high-value equipment and supplies that could not be shipped by normal cargo sealift. This eventually extended to Hokkaido, Japan after the end of the war, the route becoming part of the Great Circle Route from Japan to the United States. Much of the transport along the routes were an airline responsibility, with Northwest Airlines and Western Airlines operating the routes under contract.\n\n1944 also saw a drastic reduction in the personnel of the Eleventh Air Force. Fort Glenn AAF and Fort Randall AAF were reduced to the status of gasoline stations for the Aleutian air transport routes, and were manned by small housekeeping units; Annette Island Landing Field and Yakutat Landing Field assigned as sub bases to Elmendorf Field. The XI Bomber Command and XI Fighter Command disbanded per General Order 9, Headquarters, Eleventh Air Force, 25 February 1944.\n\nIt took these actions due to the fact that only two bomber squadrons remained in the Eleventh Air Force and the need to reduce the number of personnel. The 28th Bombardment Group on Shemya and the 343d Fighter Group at Alexai Point AAF, Attu, assumed the responsibilities of the two commands. The 404th Bombardment Squadron was responsible for conducting night reconnaissance missions over the Kuriles and flying a daily weather reconnaissance flights. The 77th Bombardment Squadron was held in readiness to repel a seaborne invasion and the fighter squadrons provided air defense. Air Corps supply and fourth echelon maintenance was carried on at the Alaska Air Depot at Elmendorf, and the normal paper-work, customarily handled by a Service command, devolved upon the Eleventh Air Force Headquarters.\n\nEleventh Air Force, sent between 24 August and 4 September 1945 two B-24 Liberators of the 28th BG flew reconnaissance overflights over the North Kuril Islands to take photos of the Soviet occupation in the area. Soviet fighters intercepted and forced them away a foretaste of the Cold war that lay ahead.\n\nAmericans planners had briefly contemplated an invasion of northern Japan from the Aleutian Islands during fall of 1943, but rejected that idea as too risky and impractical. They considered the use of Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, on Amchitka and Shemya Bases, but rejected that idea too. U.S. military maintained interest in these plans when they ordered the expansion of bases in the western Aleutian Islands, and major construction began on Shemya for a possible invasion of Japan via the Northern route in 1945.\n\nThe real nature of the Aleutian Islands the value of the Eleventh Air Force to America was known but not confirmed until 3 September 1945. On that day, a C-54 piloted by Major G. E. Cain, filed a flight plan at Atsugi Airdrome, near Tokyo, Honshū, Japan. Twelve hours later, he landed at Adak, refueled and took off for Seattle. He landed in Washington after 31 hours of flying time, with the first motion pictures of the Japanese surrender the previous day.\n\nThe Aleutian Islands, on the Great Circle route from North America to the Orient may not have fulfilled their hope of becoming the \"Northern Highway to Victory,\" but they were established as an air transport route, vital during the early years of the Cold War before long-distance air transports were developed.\n\nWith the end of the war, many of the small air bases in the Aleutian Islands closed permanently, and postwar emphasis turned to training. Air Transport Command transferred Ladd Field to the Eleventh Air Force on 1 November. On 15 December 1945, The Army reorganized its organization in Alaska. Eleventh Air Force, which was under the jurisdiction of the Army Western Defense Command, headquartered at the Presidio of San Francisco since its establishment in 1941, was transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States Army Air Forces.\n\nUnder the USAAF, it was re-designated as Alaskan Air Command' on 18 December 1945, without any change in headquarters location. Alaskan Air Command was established at the same Major Command echelon as the other overseas combat commands, the United States Air Forces in Europe, Far East Air Forces and Caribbean Air Command, with its mission being the air defense of the Territory of Alaska.\n\nSix months after Eleventh Air Force had been redesignated in Alaska, another headquarters, also named Eleventh Air Force, was established on 13 May 1946 and activated at Olmsted Field, Pennsylvania, on 13 June 1946. This new organization was assigned to Air Defense Command.\n\nMajor General Thomas J. Hanley, Jr. took command, and a cadre of enlisted personnel arrived at Olmsted on 19 June 1946. The headquarters was relocated to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on 9 August 1946, base units were assigned and training commenced for reserve and National Guard units in Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Training continued until the unit was inactivated on 1 July 1948. This organization was to have been activated on 1 July 1962 at Travis Air Force Base under Military Air Transport Service, but that action was revoked three days before it became effective. This unit is not related to the current Eleventh Air Force.\n\nWith the activation of the Alaskan Command in 1989, the next logical step was to place its air component (AAC) under the Pacific Air Forces. By reorganizing AAC into a Numbered Air Force, the Air Force was able to reduce its administrative manpower requirements during a period of massive Air Force strength reductions. On 9 August 1990, the Alaskan Air Command was redesignated the 11th Air Force once again and assigned as a Numbered Air Force (NAF) under United States Pacific Air Forces. The new organization was allotted the lineage of the previous Eleventh Air Force that had served in Alaska.\n\nThe early 1990s was a period of mission changes and force modernization. The 11th Air Force was reorganized as an objective Numbered Air Force during 1992–1993 and its headquarters reduced to only 100 authorizations.\n\nIts major units also changed. At Elmendorf AFB the 21st Tactical Fighter Wing was inactivated and was replaced by the 3rd Wing transferred from Clark AB in December 1991 due to the destruction of Clark AB by the Mount Pinatubo eruption. The F-15E Strike Eagle-equipped 90th Fighter Squadron was added as were the 517th Airlift Squadron (C-130Hs and C-12Fs) and the 962d Airborne Air Control Squadron (E-3B). There were also significant changes at Eielson AFB, when on 1 September 1992, Strategic Air Command inactivated the 6th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, assigned there in 1967.\n\nThe 343d Composite Wing became the host unit. The Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II assigned to the 18th Fighter Squadron were replaced with General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons in 1992 and an OA-10A squadron was activated. Eielson AFB became home of the Exercise Cope Thunder series, and the Alaskan range complex was greatly expanded and improved to accommodate not only Cope Thunder but other joint training requirements as well.\n\nFinally, in keeping with Air Force Chief of Staff guidance to retain the most illustrious units, the 343rd Wing, a veteran of the Aleutian Campaign, was inactivated in August 1993. The 354th Fighter Wing was activated in its place.\n\nOther changes during the period included upgrading the 11th Tactical Air Control Group to the 11th Air Control Wing (11 ACW) at Eareckson AS in January 1992. During yet another reorganization, the wing subsequently inactivated 1 July 1994 with the closure of the station. It was replaced by three smaller groups directly subordinate to the Eleventh Air Force; the 611th Air Operations Group, 611th Logistics Group and the 611th Air Support Group.\n\nEleventh Air Force also accomplished the daunting drawdown of the forward operating bases at Galena Airport, King Salmon Airport and Eareckson Air Force Station (Shemya Island), in a two-year period of time, 1993–1995, reflecting cost savings derived from the end of the Cold War. The stations, however, remain in a standby status, their facilities being maintained by civilian contractors.\n\nThe mission of the Eleventh Air Force moved inexorably from statically defending Alaska against a bomber threat to committing its forces to worldwide deployment. The shift from a Major Command to an Objective Numbered Air Force was among the most drastic reorganizations undertaken anywhere in the Air Force.\n\nAir Force personnel in Alaska were also fully integrated into the Air and Space Expeditionary Force deployment cycles, supporting operations as part of the Global War on Terrorism. In 2001–2002, the 18th Fighter Squadron deployed to Al Jaber, AB, Kuwait to take part in Operation Southern Watch, ENDURING FREEDOM, and ANACONDA; in 2004, The 355th Fighter Squadron deployed to Bagram AB, Afghanistan, as part of the War in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense released the proposed 2005 Base Realignment And Closure recommendations and Eielson AFB was on the list. The original recommendations called for Eielson to be drawn down to a warm status...nearly to the point of closure. However, the final decision came later in the year and it called for the departure of all the A-10s. Shortly thereafter, the 18 FS learned that they would be converting to F-16 Aggressors over the next few years. In 2007, the last three A-10 aircraft departed Eielson\n\nThe responsibilities for aerospace warning and aerospace control for North America are assigned to NORAD through the binational NORAD agreement. The Alaskan NORAD Region (ANR) is one of three NORAD regions responsible for the execution of the aerospace warning and aerospace control missions. ANR conducts these missions 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nEleventh Air Force is the United States Air Force component of ANR. Coordinating with the Canadian Forces Air Command, Both 11th AF and the Canadian Forces provide active duty forces to the 611th Air and Space Operations Center. The 176th Air Control Squadron, an Alaska Air National Guard unit, provides manning for the Alaskan Air Defense Sector to maintain continuous surveillance of Alaskan airspace with Alaskan Radar System long and short-range radars.\n\nUnder Alaskan Air Command, aerospace forces were built up in the 1950s and 1960s in response to a long-range bomber threat. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, concern shifted to the strategic ballistic missile threat and active air defenses were reduced.\n\nThe appearance of a strategic cruise missile threat once again prompted a buildup of air defense capabilities. The Alaska NORAD Region Air Operations Center (AKRAOC), operated by U.S. and Canadian personnel, became operational in 1983 at Elmendorf AFB which receives and analyses surveillance radar data from the sites in the Alaska Radar System (ARS) to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not the objects are friendly or hostile.\n\nThe Alaska RAOC enjoins state-of-the-art air defense systems and cutting-edge computer technology to significantly increase surveillance and identification capabilities, and better protect the nation's airways from intrusion and attack. It is fully integrated with the E-3B Airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) system. It employs Battle Control System-Fixed (BCS-F), a next-generation air sovereignty system. BCS-F fuses data from airborne, ground and naval elements and civil air traffic sensors into an integrated air picture. This allows commanders to surveil and monitor the airspace above, beyond and within U.S. and Canadian borders, providing a major component for homeland defense. It also incorporates a newly developed situational awareness system that gives ANR unprecedented tools and technology to assist state and local responders in dealing with natural disasters.\n\nThe ARS consists of minimally attended AN/FPS-117 radar sites which were established between 1984 and 1985 at the former manned surveillance and Ground Control Intercept sites of Alaskan Air Command, first activated in the 1950s. Elements of the 1985 North American Air Defense Modernization program followed. Flexible and graduated alert concepts were introduced in the 1990s.\n\nThe ANR provides an ongoing capability to detect, validate, and warn of any aircraft and/or cruise missile threat in its area of operations that could threaten North American security. By maintaining surveillance of Northwest Canadian and U.S. airspace, ANR is able to determine what goes on in and near North American airspace 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Aerospace control requires capabilities to intercept, shadow, escort, divert, direct landings, and if necessary, use force utilizing interceptors and other means up to and including the destruction of airborne objects.\n\n\n\nThe United States Department of War activated the Alaskan Air Force to manage the buildup of the Army Air Forces in Alaska and replacing the Air Force, Alaskan Defense Command.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Large new oil discoveries within it were announced in early 2019.\n\nThe field is being developed by BP plc and 25% partner ExxonMobil It is the largest offshore production platform in the Gulf, with a processing capacity of of oil and of natural gas, and the field is believed to hold in excess of of oil. Actual production approached capacity in March 2009, but started to decline soon after that.\n\nIn January 2019, BP announced a new billion barrels of oil have been found within the field.\n\nThe Thunder Horse discovery well was drilled in 1999 on Mississippi Canyon block 778. It was drilled to a depth of from the drillship \"Discoverer 534\", hitting three intervals of oil.\n\nA second well was drilled in block 822, southeast of the initial discovery, reaching a depth of in November 2000 and also encountered three primary intervals of oil.\n\nIn February 2001 a new field known as Thunder Horse North was drilled in block 776, approximately 5 miles northwest of the original field. This well reached and again met three intervals of oil.\n\nActually developing the field was a major technological challenge due to the depth of the find. Not only are the distances large, but at such depths the formations holding the hydrocarbons create pressures over and temperatures of . Prior to Thunder Horse, no field had ever been developed at such a depth.\n\nFollowing lengthy delays caused by the need to repair and replace components in the subsea system (following a failure during pre-commissioning checks), \"First oil\" came on June 14, 2008. Since then, Thunder Horse has steadily ramped up its production by bringing on new wells. In March 2009, Thunder Horse produced close to oil equivalent in oil and natural gas from seven wells. Plans were in place to add two additional wells in 2009 to further develop the north end of the field. By January 2010 the MMS data indicated that total daily production during 2009 had declined from near . The Washington Post noted in May 2010 that \"There could be less off-shore oil than the [Obama] administration assumes\" quoting an analysis in TheOilDrum.com by Glenn Morton, a consultant for oil exploration projects who stated that \"Thunder Horse hasn't reached anywhere near its expected potential,\" in oil or natural gas a fact which \"underscore[s] the point that deepwater oil drilling is a tricky process, and not always as easy or predictable as thought\"\n\n\"Thunder Horse PDQ\" is the largest moored semi-submersible production oil platform in the world, located in of water in the Mississippi Canyon Block 778/822, about southeast of New Orleans.\n\nThe hull section was constructed by DSME in South Korea and delivered in to Kiewit Offshore Services in Ingleside, Texas on 23 September 2004 aboard MV \"Blue Marlin\" for completion. Thunder Horse was completed at Kiewit Offshore Services in nearby Ingleside, Texas.\n\n\"Thunder Horse PDQ\" was evacuated with the approach of Hurricane Dennis in July 2005. after the hurricane passed, the platform was listing badly. The platform was designed for a 100-year event, and inspection teams found no hull damage, and no water was taken on from a leak through its hull. Rather, an incorrectly plumbed, 6-inch length of pipe allowed water to flow freely among several ballast tanks that set forth a chain of events causing the platform to tip into the water. The platform was fully righted about a week after \"Dennis\", delaying commercial production initially scheduled for late 2005. During repairs, it was discovered that the underwater manifold was severely cracked due to poorly welded pipes. The rig's design engineer, Gordon Aaker, said that the cracked manifold could have caused a catastrophic oil spill.\n\nThe platform took a near-direct hit six weeks later by Hurricane Katrina, but was undamaged.\n\nOriginally called \"Crazy Horse\", BP changed the name out of respect to descendants of the Native American warrior of the same name.

{"id": "2221741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221741", "title": "Canada national rugby union team", "text": "Canada national rugby union team\n\nThe Canada national rugby union team () represents Canada in men's international rugby union and it's governed by Rugby Canada, and play in red and white. Canada is classified by World Rugby as a tier two rugby nation. Canada competes in competitions such as the Americas Rugby Championship and the Rugby World Cup.\n\nCanada has been playing international rugby since their 1932 debut against Japan. Canada have competed at every World Cup since the tournament was first staged in 1987, the only North American team to do so. Canada achieved their best result at the World Cup in 1991, where they reached the quarterfinals. Canada was once the dominant power of North American rugby and was the second best team in the Americas; Canada currently ranks fourth in the region after Argentina, the US and Uruguay. The team has achieved victories over Six Nations teams such as France, Wales, Italy, and Scotland on at least one occasion in past years, mostly during the amateur era. Canada is currently ranked 22nd in the World Rugby Rankings.\n\nIn 1874 the first North American international game took place in Cambridge, Massachusetts between McGill and Harvard universities. Later that same year a second game was played, but this time Harvard were the hosts, and the game was played with early \"American Football\" rules. Today, in carrying on the oldest annual sporting competition in North America, McGill University and Harvard University continue the tradition of competing for the Covo Cup, at alternating venues each November, using the original rules of rugby football. McGill University can therefore lay claim to being the oldest rugby club in Canada, but due to rugby's popularity among students and the McGill University Rugby Football Club's affiliation with the university, the claim as the oldest independent rugby club goes to the still active Westmount Rugby Football Club.\n\nA Canadian Rugby Football Union was established in 1884, although this organisation went on to become the Canadian Football League, as rugby football in Canada evolved into Canadian football. In 1902–1903 the first Canadian team toured Britain. In 1909, Earl Grey, then Governor General of Canada, donated a trophy to the CRU to be awarded for the Rugby Football Championship of Canada. This trophy became known as the Grey Cup. However the rules used in Canada were vastly different from the rules used in countries that were part of the IRB. In the years that followed, the CRU would legalise forward passing and make other changes that would make Canadian football a totally different sport, similar to American football.\n\nDuring World War I and II rugby union was suspended but in the inter-war period there was something of a renaissance. In 1919 a Canadian Services team played overseas against representatives from England, New Zealand, South Africa and Australia. The formation of the Rugby Union of Canada took place in 1929 and this was followed by a tour of Japan by a Canadian representative side in 1932 to help foster trade between the two countries. About half the team were Canadian born (mostly British Columbia players) and the rest were originally from Britain. They lost 9–8 and 38–5 in the two test matches.\n\nThe original Canadian Rugby Union disbanded just before World War I. Canada's team to the United Kingdom in 1962 was dominated by British Columbia players. The Rugby Union of Canada was re-formed in 1965 as the Canadian Rugby Union. The 1966 British Lions played a non-cap match in Toronto on their way back from Australia and New Zealand, a match they won 19–8. Canada established themselves as the strongest team in North America, though they struggled to compete with the major test-playing nations in Europe and the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nCanada were one of the 16 nations that were invited by the International Rugby Board (IRB) to compete at the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987, hosted by both Australia and New Zealand. Canada were grouped with Wales, Ireland and Tonga in Pool 2. In their first ever World Cup match they defeated Tonga 37–4. However they lost their subsequent matches 46–19 to Ireland and 40–9 to Wales, and finished third in the pool (not advancing to the finals).\n\nCanada had to qualify for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Canada took part in the Americas tournaments, and finished first in the Americas qualifying standings. At the 1991 Rugby World Cup, Canada was placed into Pool D, alongside France, Romania and Fiji. Canada beat Fiji and Romania but lost their fixture against France 19–13 to finish second in the pool, advancing to the quarter-finals. They were then knocked out in the quarter-final by the All Blacks, 29–13. The 1991 tournament stands as Canada's best ever finish in a Rugby World Cup.\n\nCanada beat Wales 26–24 on November 10, 1993 at Cardiff Arms Park; beat France 18–16 on June 4, 1994 at Twin Elms Rugby Park in Nepean, Ontario; battled to a 27–27 draw against Ireland on 27 June 2000 at Markham, Ontario; and chalked up a 26–23 win against Scotland in Vancouver, British Columbia on June 15, 2002. The win over Scotland was the start of a streak of seven victories before losing to Wales in Cardiff.\n\nCanada has never beaten England in six games, but has played their national XV, B team, and Under 23 teams eleven times (for which Canada awarded its players international caps.) The most notable result was a 15–12 victory over a strong England XV on 29 May 1993 at Swangard Stadium in Burnaby. Unfortunately for the Canadians, on the eve of the match England's management chose not to award international caps (due to fact that some players were touring with the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand at the time.) Additionally, before defeating Scotland proper in 2002, Canada beat Scotland XV 24–19 on May 25, 1991 at Saint John, New Brunswick.\n\nAs they were quarter finalists in 1991, they automatically qualified for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. They were in Pool A with the hosts South Africa, defending champions Australia, and Romania. Canada finished third in the pool, winning their match against Romania but losing 27–11 to Australia and 20–0 to the Springboks.\n\nCanada won the now defunct Pacific Rim tournament three years in succession in 1996, 1997 and 1998.\n\nCanada finished second in Round 4 of the Americas 1999 Rugby World Cup qualifying, losing only to Argentina, and qualified for the World Cup. Canada finished third in their pool (with France, Fiji and Namibia), winning their match against Namibia but losing their other two fixtures. The victory against Namibia was uncharacteristic for Canada, as they ran the score up to 72–11, one of their most lopsided victories, as there was a very slight statistical chance that they could have advanced on points scored. This thrashing was the one bright light in an otherwise gloomy and disappointing 1999 World Cup performance.\n\nLike all second- and third-tier nations, the Canadians have had problems having these players available for important games. As a consequence Canada has slipped out of the top 10 rugby union nations, but has nevertheless provided top class players such as Dan Baugh, Rod Snow, Mike James, Colin Yukes, Dave Lougheed and Jamie Cudmore to teams in England, Wales and France. The Canadians qualified for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia.\n\nCanada qualified as Americas 1, finishing at the top of Round 4 Americas tournaments, winning five of their six fixtures to enter the 2003 World Cup in Australia, their fifth world cup in a row. Canada's sole win was a 24–7 result against Tonga as they lost their games against Italy, Wales and the All Blacks.\n\nSince 2003 Canada has played host to the Churchill Cup, making the final in 2010 but losing to the England Saxons 38–18. In 2004 and 2005 they replaced China in the Super Powers Cup. For the 2004 Superpowers Cup, Canada was substituted for China. In 2005 the competition was renamed the Super Cup. Canada beat Japan 15–10 in the final.\n\nIn 2006 Canada completed the qualification process for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. They were in a three-team group also containing Barbados and the United States. Each played the other once. On 24 June 2006, Canada defeated Barbados 71–3, in Bridgetown, their largest ever win. Canada achieved a record win over the US in the match in Newfoundland on August 12, 2006, defeating the USA 56–7 in front of a capacity crowd, when player James Pritchard scored a national record 36 points with three tries, six conversions and three penalties in the match, beating the record of 29 he had set against Barbados in their previous match. The win assured Canada of a place in the 2007 World Cup as Americas 2 in Pool B. Also that year, a Canadian team won the NA4 and the national team beat the US earlier in the Churchill Cup.\n\nGoing into the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, Canada were ranked as severe outsiders, and given odds of 5000/1 to win the tournament. Pool B also contained Australia, Fiji, Japan and Wales. In their opening match on 9 September the Canadians lost 42–17 to Wales. They followed this with a 29–16 loss to Fiji, whom they had needed to beat to have realistic hopes of progressing to the quarterfinals. They drew 12–12 with Japan, conceding an injury-time try by Koji Taira. In their final game they lost 37–6 to an Australian side consisting mostly of second-string players. Canada finished bottom of Pool B, and returned home from a World Cup without winning a single game for the first time ever.\n\nFollowing the 2007 Rugby World Cup Canada hired Kieran Crowley as head coach, and by April 2008 the former New Zealand All Black took over coaching duties.\nIn Autumn 2008 the Canadians toured Europe, beating Portugal in their opening match, but suffering heavy defeats in their subsequent games in Ireland, Wales and Scotland. In 2009 the Canadians hosted a tour by the Welsh and Irish.\n\nCanada beat the United States in a two-legged playoff game in July 2009 to qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand and enter the tournament as Americas 1.\n\nCanada began its Rugby World Cup preparations by finishing runner-up in the 2011 Churchill Cup for the second year in a row, losing 37–6 in the final to the England Saxons (England's second-string side). This good form carried on in a two-legged home and away series against the USA Eagles. In the home leg Canada secured a 28–22 victory in front a record 10,621 fans. In the away leg Canada won 27–7. Their warm-up schedule continued with a match against the Australian Barbarians which featured several of Australia's World Cup squad, and the Barbarians claimed a comfortable 38–14 victory.\n\nThe Canadians began their 2011 Rugby World Cup on September 14 against Tonga, winning 25–20. They followed this up with a 46–19 loss to France on September 18. The team had only a four-day turn-around after their first match, and let the game slip out of their reach within the final 20 minutes. They produced a repeat result of 2007, by playing to a 23–23 draw against Japan. Their Rugby World Cup concluded with a 79–15 loss against the All Blacks. Canada finished fourth in their pool, narrowly missing out on automatic qualification for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n\nCanada secured a spot in the 2015 Rugby World Cup on 23 August 2013, with a 13–11 win over the US, 40–20 on aggregate.\n\nCanada joined Pool D with France, Ireland, Italy and Romania. Canada finished the tournament with zero wins, last in Pool D.\n\nAt the 2016 Americas Rugby Championship, Canada claimed three wins over Uruguay, Chile and Brazil, and two losses versus Argentina XV and United States. In June 2016, the team defeated Russia and lost to Japan and Italy. In November 2016, Canada was defeated by Ireland, Romania and Samoa.\n\nAt the 2017 Americas Rugby Championship, Canada scored a single win versus Chile, and lost the other four matches. In June 2017, the team lost to Georgia and Romania. Later they faced United States for the 2019 World Cup North America play-off, being beaten on aggregate for the first time. In November 2017, Canada lost to the Māori All Blacks, Georgia and Fiji, while defeating Spain.\n\nIn 2018, Canada lost both matches versus Uruguay for the 2019 World Cup Americas play-off, therefore the team advanced to the intercontinental repechage which it won, securing the very last spot in the final tournament. The team also lost to United States in the 2018 Americas Rugby Championship.\n\nCanada secured the last spot in the 2019 Rugby World Cup on 23 November 2018, winning all of its three matches of the intercontinental repechage in Marseille, France.\n\nThey join 2019 Rugby World Cup Pool B with title holders New Zealand and third-placed team from 2015 South Africa, Italy and the African qualifier, Namibia.\n\nThe national team currently does not have a permanent home stadium and as such play their matches at various locations across Canada. BMO Field in Toronto, Ontario has been proposed as the national team's home stadium, even though it cannot provide a suitable rugby climate year-round. However, rumours have the national team playing out of the proposed Whitecaps Waterfront Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia if it is constructed. This would place the national rugby stadium in the country's main rugby stronghold of British Columbia, and in a city whose winter climate is considerably milder than that of most of the rest of Canada.\n\nIn August 2011 it was announced that the national team would have a permanent training centre located in Langford, British Columbia.\n\nThe highest attended matches in Canada involving the Canadian national team are:\n\nCanada has played in every Rugby World Cup since the inaugural 1987 tournament, always qualifying during the first round. However, for 2019, they have failed to qualify during the first two rounds, and can only qualify through the 4-team repechage in November 2018.\n\nBelow is table of the representative rugby matches played by a Canada national XV at test level up until 9 September 2019.\n\nThe following is a list of Canada's wins against Tier 1 countries:\n\nOn 3 September, Canada named their 31-man squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\n\nOn September 11, injured flanker Justin Blanchet was replaced by lock Josh Larsen in the World Cup squad.\n\nOn September 27, injured centres Nick Blevins and Ben LeSage were replaced in the squad by Guiseppe du Toit and Theo Sauder.\n\nOn October 3, Kainoa Lloyd joined the squad as an injury replacement for Taylor Paris.\n\nHead coach: Kingsley Jones\n\n\nLast updated: New Zealand vs Canada, 02 October 2019.

The core members of the Ancients were Samuel Palmer, George Richmond, and Edward Calvert. Except for Palmer, the central members who were artists were all students at the Royal Academy of Arts. They met in Blake's apartment, dubbed the \"House of Interpreter\" and at the home of Samuel Palmer in the Kent village of Shoreham. The Ancients made little impact on the English artistic scene during the ten years or so that the group continued, but several members were later significant artists, and interest in the group has gradually increased since the late 19th-century.\n\nThey were the first English manifestation of the formalised artistic \"brotherhood\", an artistic movement whose aims included elements of communal living and promotion of a general vision for society. Continental groups of this sort included the German Nazarene movement and the Barbus in Paris, and the most successful later English example was to be the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Like these groups they represented an oppositional break-away from the academic art establishment, and looked back to an idealized version of the past. They pursued equality among their members as a reaction to the hierarchical structure of the conventional art world. Like Nazarenes and Barbus, they promoted the wearing of special revivalist costume, though only Palmer seems often to have worn it in practice; it seems to be shown in some portraits of Palmer by Richmond such as the bust-length miniature and chalk drawing (1829, both National Portrait Gallery), which shows a round-necked pleated smock under a coat with a loose untidy collar and lapels, combined with somewhat Christ-like long hair and a beard. The Ancients were probably aware of the Nazarenes, but probably not of the Barbus.\n\nUnlike Blake they were mostly High Tory in politics, but equally distrustful of the modern mercantile society booming around them, and looked back to an idealized ruralist past. They never produced a manifesto, and their activities and relationships are poorly documented; Palmer's son later destroyed most of his father's papers from the period, hinting darkly that they contained sexual material showing \"a mental condition ... full of danger, and neither sufficiently masculine nor sufficiently reticent\". Most of the information about the group's activities and dynamics comes from memoirs by them or their families and friends recalled several decades later. Their name may have come from John Giles, Palmer's stockbroker cousin, who despite being no artist was an important figure in the group and perhaps the initial instigator, as Palmer's son suggested. He is recorded as very often extolling the superiority of \"the ancients\" in any context that occurred in conversation, though the word is also an important one for Blake. At this period \"ancient\" was a vaguer term than in modern English, often used to refer to the medieval or even Renaissance, as in the English legal term \"Ancient Monument\".\n\nChristiana Payne, in the \"Grove Dictionary of Art\", states, \"Their subject-matter was drawn from the Bible, or from a vision of a golden age of pastoral innocence and abundance that had both Christian and Vergilian overtones.\"\nThe artist members submitted works for the Royal Academy exhibitions, many of which were exhibited, but these \"stimulated no critical enthusiasm and were evidently not considered sufficiently threatening to provoke outrage, as the Pre-Raphaelites were to do a generation later\". None of the exhibited works seem to have been sold, and the group received very few commissions for works in \"Ancient\" style, though Richmond's successful career as a conventional portraitist took off in the early 1830s. Nor did the people of Shoreham seem to take objection to Palmer and his visitors, though he records they were known by some locals as the Extollagers, an attempt at \"astrologers\". Palmer added other local properties to his house there, which he rented out for the rest of his life.\n\nBoth the Nazarene Brotherhood and the Barbus were able to attempt communal living in abandoned monasteries outside Rome and Paris respectively, but these convenient possibilities on the continent in the Napoleonic period were not available in the London of the 1820s, so Palmer encouraged long-term stays at his house in Shoreham or elsewhere in the village. Most members had commitments of work or family in London that meant their visits were of weeks if not days, and only William Palmer and Welby Sherman seem to have stayed longer. Blake himself made the trip at least once. \nThe artist John Linnell (1792—1882) was not a member of the group however he was close to most of the members. Palmer's reference to Linnell's young daughters as \"little ancients\" in a letter to him of September 1824 is a key piece of evidence as to the date the group was formed (Palmer later married one of them, Hannah). Linnel was seven years older than Calvert, the oldest in the group, and a strong-minded person who disagreed with many of the group's positions. In a letter to Palmer years later he wrote that \"I ought to remember that I was not one of the monthly-meeting \"elite\"— when at the Platonic feast of reason and soul only real Greeks from Hackney and Lisson Grove were admitted\". Linnell was probably mainly responsible for introducing Palmer and the others to northern European art of the 15th and 16th centuries, which was then relatively little-known in England. He knew Charles (Karl) Aders, a German businessman living in London who had an important collection of early Northern paintings, including a copy of the \"Ghent Altarpiece\", which Linnell enabled the group to visit.\n\nIn 1832 Palmer received a further legacy, with which he bought a cottage in St John's Wood in London, and thereafter he gradually spent more time in London. The monthly dinners to which Linnell's letter refers were usually held there. Palmer and Richmond with their wives left together for an extended visit to Italy in 1837, which may be taken as the final end of the group, though most members continued as friends long afterwards. The exposure in Italy to art in the classical tradition influenced both artists to move away from Ancient primitivism. The proximity of Shoreham to the Captain Swing campaign of insurgency among rural labourers in 1830, which Palmer violently opposed, may have disillusioned him as to the peace and harmony of rural life. Richmond wrote in a letter to Palmer in later life \"We all wanted thrashing when in a dream of sentiment we thought we were learning art\".\n\nIf there was ever any formal list of members, it has not survived, but the main figures, recruited roughly between 1824 and 1827, were:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2221745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221745", "title": "Korg MS-20", "text": "Korg MS-20\n\nThe Korg MS-20 is a patchable semi-modular monophonic analog synthesizer which Korg released in 1978 and which was in production until 1983. It was part of Korg's MS series of instruments, which also included the single oscillator MS-10, the keyboardless MS-50 module, the SQ-10 sequencer, and the VC-10 Vocoder. Additional devices included the MS-01 Foot Controller, MS-02 Interface, MS-03 Signal Processor, and MS-04 Modulation Pedal.\n\nAlthough the MS-20 follows a conventional subtractive synthesis architecture of oscillators/filter/vca, its patch panel allows some rerouting of both audio and modulation, and it includes an external signal processor. This flexibility led to its resurgence during the analog revival of the late 1990s.\n\nIn 2013, Korg responded to a revived interest in monophonic analog synthesizers by reintroducing the MS-20 in a reduced-sized form, as the MS-20 Mini. Apart from being 86% of the size of the original, the use of 1/8\" jacks on the patch area, and the addition of MIDI capabilities, the MS-20 Mini is otherwise electronically identical to the original.\n\nThe MS-20 has two VCOs. The output of VCO1 can be set to triangle, sawtooth, adjustable-width pulse or white noise. The output of VCO2 can be set to sawtooth, square, rectangle or \"ring mod\" which is in fact an exclusive-OR between the pulse output of VCO1 and the square wave output of VCO2. Although the pulse width of VCO1 is adjustable, there is no voltage control for this parameter and as a result pulse width modulation is not possible although mods have successfully achieved this. The VCOs have Hz/V voltage control inputs but note that oct/V scaling is available via judicious use of the \"total\" CV input socket.\n\nThere are two VCFs in series. The first is a 6 dB/oct high-pass, the second a 12 dB/oct low-pass. Resonance (\"peak\" in Korg parlance) is adjustable but not voltage-controlled.\n\nOriginally, the filters used Korg's proprietary KORG-35 thick film IC. Later, the filters were redesigned to use off-the-shelf LM13600 OTAs. MS-20 units fitted with LM13600 filters have a small daughter board; the front panel on such units \"often\" has a tell-tale mounting screw whose head is visible in the vicinity of the VCA block diagram. However, a report to the Analogue Heaven email list in January 2010 identified an MS-20 with the front panel screw but containing the Korg 35 filter thick film circuit rather than the expected LM13600 circuit.\n\nA useful illustration of the Korg-35 filter in-circuit is shown here and some photographs illustrating the later LM13600 filter daughterboard are shown here (both URLs valid as of May 4, 2013). The tonal difference between the two is that the original Korg-35 filter has a slight amount of hiss which overdrives into the sound at high resonant settings. This causes the filter to have more of a \"screaming\" effect similar to it being used with a distortion pedal. The revised filter has most of this noise cleared up and is less aggressive sounding.\n\nThe final component in the audio path is a VCA. It is a single-transistor design, based on a selected 2SC945 which is an NPN silicon device (equivalenced by 2N2222A according to the Towers' International Transistor Selector book, update 5 (, 90100)).\n\nThe MS-20 has a low frequency oscillator, labelled \"modulation generator\". It has two controls (\"rate\" and \"shape\") and two outputs (pulse and sloped).\n\nThe shape control was a rather unusual feature for the time. It affects the duty cycle of the pulse output and the shape of the sloped output. When the control is at the anticlockwise end, the pulse width is very high (pulse output stays high for most of the cycle) and the sloped output is an upward sawtooth wave. At the clockwise end, the pulse width is very low (pulse output stays low for most of the cycle) and the sloped output is a downward sawtooth wave. At midway, the pulse width is 50% (pulse output is a square wave) and the sloped output is a triangle wave.\n\nThe pulse output is available through the patch panel. It is unipolar (0 or +5V) and suitable for triggering the S&H or the envelope generators.\n\nThe sloped output is bipolar (-2.5V to +2.5V). Like the pulse output, it is available through a dedicated jack on the patch panel. It also feeds the top modulation bus and so can be used to modulate the frequency of the VCOs and the cutoff frequency of either or both VCF without patching.\n\nThere are two envelope generators. EG1 has Delay, Attack, and Release parameters, whilst EG2 has Hold, Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release. The envelope generators have S-trig trigger inputs.\n\nThe MS-20 also includes a noise source (pink and white), a separate vactrol-based modulation VCA, a wheel controller, and a trigger button. It is possible to connect the MS-20 to a step sequencer like the SQ-10 (another product by Korg). This involves making use of the CV input and the trigger input which connects straight to the SQ-10, this means that the synthesizer and the step sequencer can work in synchronisation to play the notes when the next step of the sequencers pattern is triggered. In theory it is possible to connect any analogue sequencer to the MS-20 providing it has a trigger and CV output.\n\nThe MS-20 includes a frequency-voltage converter, envelope follower and gate extractor which can be used to drive it with an external signal. By connecting the output of the F-V converter to the CV input of the VCOs (VCO 1+2 CV IN) and the output of the gate extractor to the trigger input of the envelope generators (TRIG IN), the operator can play the MS-20 through his/her voice or another instrument.\n\nInstead of triggering the envelope generators, one can connect the output of the envelope follower to the main VCA's INITIAL GAIN input. In that mode of operation, the envelope generators are not used and the envelope of the MS-20's output is simply that of the external signal.\n\nIn January, 2013, Korg announced at NAMM that the company would release the Korg MS-20 mini. It is 86% the size of the Korg MS-20. The mini was designed by the engineers who developed the original MS-20. It aims to be a faithful re-release of the original electronic circuits of the MS-20. The MS-20 mini features 1/8-inch input and output jacks, a MIDI IN jack as well as USB MIDI (input and output).\n\nIn January, 2014, Korg announced that they would release a limited edition full-size unassembled MS-20. Like the MS-20 Mini, this kit adds MIDI and USB connectivity. The MS-20 Kit also includes both MS-20 filter revisions, selectable by the user. \n\nIn January, 2015, Korg announced at the 2015 NAMM show they would release an unassembled desktop module kit called the \"MS-20M Kit.\" The module kit does not include a keyboard and was sold as a bundle with the Korg SQ-1 step sequencer. This version features self-oscillating high-pass/low-pass filters with distinctive distortion, toggle switches for VCO 1 to 2 sync / VCO 1 to 2 FM, a toggle to switch between rev 1 and rev 2 filter designs, PWM IN jack allows pulse width modulation, supports all CV/GATE specifications: Hz/V and V/Oct, S-Trig and V-Trig, a MIDI IN connector and USB MIDI connector, and adds a junction patching bay for integration with SQ-1.\n\nIn September of 2019, Behringer announced their low-cost clone of the MS-20, the K-2.\n\nAt NAMM 2020, Korg announced a full size reissue of the MS-20, the MS-20 FS.\n\nThere is a software emulator of the MS-20 included in the KORG legacy Collection. As well as a standalone emulator, the Legacy Collection provides the MS-20 as a virtual instrument (VST). The external signal processor is implemented separately as a VST effect called MS-20EX. This same software emulated MS-20 was also part of the LAC-1 expansion for the Korg OASYS and is one of the Korg Kronos sound engines.\n\nKORG DS-10 is a music creation program for the Nintendo DS that emulates the Korg MS range of synthesizers.\n\nKORG iMS-20 is an MS-20 emulator for the iPad.\n\nhttp://www.synfo.nl/servicemanuals/Korg/MS-20_SERVICE_MANUAL.pdf\n\n\n"}

The prairie was named after its rich, dark soil.\n\nThe Texas Blackland Prairies ecoregion covers an area of , consisting of a main belt of and two islands of tallgrass prairie grasslands southeast of the main Blackland Prairie belt; both the main belt and the islands extend northeast/southwest.\n\nThe main belt consists of oaklands and savannas and runs from just south of the Red River on the Texas-Oklahoma border through the Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area and into southwestern Texas. The central forest-grasslands transition lies to the north and northwest, and the Edwards Plateau savanna and the Tamaulipan mezquital to the southwest.\n\nThe larger of the two islands is the Fayette Prairie, encompassing , and the smaller is the San Antonio Prairie with an area of . The two islands are separated from the main belt by the oak woodlands of the East Central Texas forests, which surround the islands on all sides but the northeast, where the Fayette Prairie meets the East Texas Piney Woods.\n\nThis area was shaped by frequent wildfires and visits by plains bison. Large fires ignited by lightning frequently swept the area, clearing shrubs and stimulating forbs and grasses. Large herds of bison also grazed on the grasses, and they trampled and fertilized the soil, stimulating the growth of the tallgrass ecosystem. Hunter-gatherers contributed to the formation and expansion of the prairie through controlled burns to make more land suitable for hunting bison and other game. Hunter-gatherers continually inhabited the prairie since pre-Clovis times over 15,000 years ago. In historic times, they included the Wichita, Waco, Tonkawa, and Comanche, each of whom were gradually replaced by settled agrarian society. The advent of large-scale irrigated farming and ranching in the area ended the expansionary period in the prairie's formation and quickly led to widespread habitat loss.\n\nBecause of the soil and climate, this ecoregion is ideally suited to crop agriculture. This has led to most of the Blackland Prairie ecosystem being converted to crop production, leaving less than one percent remaining (and some groups estimate less than 0.5% to less than 0.1% remaining) and making the tallgrass the most-endangered large ecosystem in North America. Small remnants are conserved at sites such as The Nature Conservancy's 800-acre Clymer Meadow Preserve near Celeste, TX.\n\nImportant prairie plants included little bluestem, yellow indiangrass, big bluestem, tall dropseed, and a variety of wildflowers including gayfeathers, asters, Maximilian sunflower, wild indigos and compass plant. The fauna of the Blackland Prairies includes foxes, frogs, lizards, rattlesnakes, opossums, coyotes, white-tailed deer, and striped skunks. The prairie was formerly home to animals such as American bison, wolves, and jaguars before overhunting and the destruction of most tallgrass ecosystems.\n\nThe soil of the Blackland Prairies, from which the \"blackland\" get its name, contains black or deep dark-gray, alkaline clay which is further blackened by char from wildfires and controlled burns. \"Black gumbo\" and \"black velvet\" are local names for this soil.

Her concept of privacy by design, which takes privacy into account throughout the system engineering process, was expanded on, as part of a joint Canadian-Dutch team, both before and during her tenure as commissioner (1997 to 2014).\n\nShe was hired by Ryerson University as a distinguished visiting professor after the end of her three terms as IPC. Cavoukian was appointed Executive Director of the Ryerson's Privacy and Big Data Institute in 2014. Since 2017, Cavoukian has been the Distinguished Expert-in-Residence of the university's Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence.\n\nCavoukian was born in Cairo, Egypt in 1952 to ethnic Armenian parents Artin and Lucie Cavoukian, and immigrated to Toronto with her family in 1958. She is the sister of Canadian children's entertainer Raffi and photographer Cavouk Cavoukian.\n\nShe holds a B.A. from York University and received an MA and Ph.D in psychology from the University of Toronto, where she specialized in criminology and law.\n\nIn the 1980s, she headed the Research Services Branch for the provincial Attorney General.\n\nShe joined the Ontario provincial Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner in 1987. Cavoukian served as its first Director of Compliance followed by her appointment as Assistant Commissioner in 1990.\n\nShe was initially appointed Commissioner in 1997, and is the first Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario to have been re-appointed for a third term. Serving as an officer of the provincial legislature, the Commissioner is independent of the government of the day.\n\nOn March 29, 2005, Commissioner Cavoukian spoke out against the adoption disclosure Bill 183, \"Adoption Information Disclosure Act,\" stating that the proposed law needed an amendment giving birth parents and adoptees from adoptions that occurred prior to the passing of this retroactive law the right, if desired, to file a disclosure veto to prevent the opening of their sealed files.\n\nThe \"Adoption Information Disclosure Act\" received Royal Assent on November 3, 2005, without Commissioner Cavoukian's proposed disclosure veto.\n\nOn September 19, 2007, Justice Belobaba, of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled the \"Adoption Information Disclosure Act\" as unconstitutional – it breached section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and thus, the sections of the \"Act\" relating to access to birth registration information are invalid.\n\nOn November 14, 2007, the government of Ontario introduced new adoption legislation that includes both a disclosure veto for adoptees and birth parents in adoptions that have already taken place and also promotes openness for adoptions where a disclosure veto is not registered and for all future adoptions. The \"Access to Adoption Records Act\" includes both a disclosure veto for adoptees and birth parents in adoptions that have already taken place.\n\nOn November 1, 2004, \"Personal Health Information Protection Act\" (PHIPA) took effect granting the province of Ontario its first health information privacy legislation where it will govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal health information. Cavoukian had been an advocate of this legislation since the IPC was first formed in 1987.\n\nThe IPC is the oversight agency for the new law. As of November 1, 2004 patients who are denied access to their own personal health records, or who believe that their personal health information was collected, used or disclosed contrary to the new legislation, can complain to the IPC.\n\nDuring her tenure, Cavoukian issued eleven Health Orders under PHIPA.\n\nCavoukian created the concept of Privacy by Design. In 2010 the annual assembly of International Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners unanimously passed a resolution recognizing privacy by design as an essential component of fundamental privacy protection and it is a core part of the European Union GDPR regulations.\n\nIn November 2007, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) announced plans to expand its video surveillance program which resulted in a formal complaint to Commissioner Cavoukian from Privacy International, a U.K.-based organization, citing concerns that the TTC's proposed expansion was a violation of privacy laws. In response to this complaint, Cavoukian launched an investigation where she ruled that the TTC's expansion of its video surveillance system did not contravene any applicable privacy laws. As part of her investigation, she made 13 recommendations to the TTC, which have all been implemented, and she also encouraged the TTC to conduct a pilot project to test the use of a privacy-enhancing video surveillance technology, developed by researchers at the University of Toronto.\n\nCavoukian was awarded an honourary LL.D by the University of Guelph at the Fall 2014 convocation.\n\nShe was hired by Ryerson University as a distinguished visiting professor after the end of her three terms as IPC. Cavoukian was appointed Executive Director of the Ryerson's Privacy and Big Data Institute in 2014. \n\nSince 2017, Cavoukian has been the Distinguished Expert-in-Residence of the university's Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence.\n\nIn 2017, Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google LLC), partnered with Waterfront Toronto to begin developing a smart city area in the 12 acre sector called Quayside. The project was heralded as a premier example that \"would develop a whole new district of Toronto as a working model of a new type of smart city\". Sidewalk Labs touted the Quayside Project as \"an experimental urban neighbourhood 'from the internet up'\". The project was occurring within the larger context of the Smart Cities Challenge, a competition for $80 million in Canadian government funding, although it was not seeking funding under the competition.\n\nThe proposed Sidewalk Labs development raised concerns around the breadth and depth of information collected under the project's umbrella. \"Quayside may be one of the most sensor-laden neighbourhoods [proposed] in North America...It's being imagined as the sort of place where garbage cans and recycling bins can keep track of when and how often they're used, environmental probes can measure noise and pollution over time and cameras can collect data to model and improve the flow of cars, people, buses and bikes throughout the day\". It was noted that \"Access to those systems and the use of that data, in this private-public partnership, will raise novel policy questions for governments about privacy and governance.” \n\nAs the project was seen as a potential standard-setting benchmark in the development of smart cities worldwide, researchers raised concerns about the value of the data collected by Alphabet in the course of the project and how that value might be negotiated with the City of Toronto- as well as the ways that data would be collected and managed. These issues were acknowledged by Waterfront Toronto's Board of Directors in March 2018: \"Privacy, data governance, cyber security and the ethical use of technology are complex questions which need to be addressed in a robust way to ensure that the Sidewalk Toronto initiative progresses in a way that encourages innovation while preserving the public good\". The Board of Directors committed to \"ensuring that the corporation has a robust team of independent advisors to ensure the protection of individual privacy rights for those who live,learn, work and visit within the new neighborhood\". As part of that commitment, Ann Cavoukian was retained by Sidewalks Lab \"to advise them on their privacy framework, and they have made a commitment to approaching all of their solutions with Privacy by Design at their foundation\".\n\nBy October of 2018, Cavoukian resigned from the Sidewalk Labs citing concerns that the project was not consistent with her widely respected \"Privacy by Design\" principles. While initially assured by Sidewalk Labs that they would de-identify all collected data at the source, Cavoukian was told at an October 15, 2018 meeting that Sidewalk Labs could not force the additional third parties involved in the data collection to similarly commit to de-identify data collected at the source. The de-identification of data at source significant according to Cavoukian because \"the smart city will likely be filled with sensors and other devices that will collect information 24/7, but their pervasiveness will make it to difficult to get consent from every person whose data is being collected\". Cavoukian stated, “When I heard that, I said, 'I’m sorry. I can’t support this. I have to resign because you committed to embedding privacy by design into every aspect of your operation'.” Her letter of resignation stated \"I imagined us creating a smart city of privacy, as opposed to a smart city of surveillance\".\n\nCavoukian met with Waterfront Toronto on November 5, 2018 to call for the immediate de-identification of data at the source and to express her willingness to continue working with the organization. Cavoukian stated, “We don’t want people worrying about where they’re coming and going. We certainly don’t want a city of surveillance. That’s not on.”\n\nCavoukian participated in a panel discussion at the 2019 ITAC Smart Cities Technology Summit in Brampton, Ontario. At one point, she said:\nCavoukian published two books on privacy with co-authors:\n\n\n\n"}

She was recommissioned with 112 guns and 1200 men when the Nine Years' War broke out in 1688 as the flagship of the \"escadre du Ponant\" (squadron of the West).\n\nShe was said to be a good sailing ship and her decorations were amongst the most beautiful and elaborate of all baroque flagships. The emblem of the \"sun\" had been chosen by Louis XIV as his personal symbol.\n\n\"Soleil Royal\" was recommissioned with 112 guns and 1200 men when the Nine Years' War broke out. She departed Brest on 22 June 1690 as flagship of Anne Hilarion de Tourville. She spent three days in Camaret-sur-Mer waiting for favourable wind before sailing to Isle of Wight where the English fleet was thought to be anchored. Two ships sent in reconnaissance located the English anchored at Beachy Head.\n\nThe Battle of Beachy Head (known in French as \"\"Bataille de Béveziers\"\") began in the morning of the 10 July 1690 when the French surprised the English ships anchored. \"Soleil Royal\" led the centre of the French formation.\n\nIn 1692, on the 12th of May, now carrying 104 guns, she left Brest, leading a 45-vessel fleet; on the 29th, the squadron met a 97-ship strong English and Dutch fleet in the Battle of Barfleur. In spite of their numerical inferiority, the French attacked but were forced to flee after a large-scale battle resulting in heavy damage to both sides. The \"Soleil Royal\" was too severely damaged to return to Brest, and was beached in Cherbourg for repairs, along with the \"Admirable\" and \"Triomphant\".\n\nDuring the night of the 2nd and 3 June, beached at the Pointe du Hommet, she was attacked by 17 ships, which she managed to repel with artillery fire. However, a fireship set her stern on fire and the fire soon reached the powder rooms. Although the population of Cherbourg came to rescue, there was only one survivor among the 883 (or even 950)-strong crew.\n\nThe remains of the \"Soleil Royal\" now lie buried beneath a parking space next to the Arsenal.\n\n\" Soleil Royal\" became a traditional name for capital ships of the Ancien Régime, and several ships bore it afterwards.\n\nA detailed 1/40th scale model of the hull and sculptures was built in 1839 by sculptor and modelist Jean-Baptiste Tanneron. This model is now on display at the Musée national de la Marine in Paris.\n\n\n"}

A continuation of the \"Jonny Quest\" (1964) series and \"The New Adventures of Jonny Quest\" (1986) series, it features teenage adventurers Jonny Quest, Hadji Singh, and Jessie Bannon as they accompany Dr. Benton Quest and bodyguard Race Bannon to investigate strange phenomena, legends, and mysteries in exotic locales. Action also takes place in the virtual realm of QuestWorld, a three-dimensional cyberspace domain rendered with computer animation. Conceived in the early 1990s, \"Real Adventures\" suffered a long and troubled development.\n\nHanna-Barbera dismissed creator Peter Lawrence in 1996 and hired new producers to finish the show. John Eng and Cosmo Anzilotti completed Lawrence's work; David Lipman, Davis Doi, and Larry Houston wrote new episodes with reworked character designs akin to those of classic \"Quest\". Each team produced half of the show's fifty-two episodes. While Lawrence's team crafted stories of real-world mystery and exploration, later writers used science fiction and paranormal plots. Turner supported the show through a massive marketing campaign with thirty-three licensees. \"Real Adventures\" debuted with an unprecedented wide release on Cartoon Network, TBS, and TNT, airing twenty-one times per week. Critics have debated the merits of the show's animation, writing, and spirit compared to classic \"Quest\", but it has also received praise in those categories.\n\n\"Real Adventures\" failed to gain high ratings with its targeted demographics and its merchandise performed poorly, leading to cancellation after fifty-two episodes. Turner Home Entertainment and Warner Home Video have released eight VHS tapes, two laserdiscs, and twenty-six DVD episodes; reruns have appeared on Toonami, CNX, and other Turner networks. All 52 episodes were made available for digital purchase on the iTunes Store in 2013.\n\nHanna-Barbera created \"The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest\" in the early 1990s after being acquired by Turner Entertainment Co. Turner planned a series of year-long \"Turner-wide initiatives\" to capitalize on old characters and create new franchises. Turner received copious fan mail and phone inquiries about \"Quest\", and observed \"incredibly high\" marketing Q Scores. The show was also Hanna-Barbera's most popular venture in the action-adventure genre; no other contemporary series featured realistic children enjoying lifelike adventures. With William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's blessings, the company planned a new series, live action film, and two telefilms—\"Jonny's Golden Quest\" and \"Jonny Quest vs. The Cyber Insects\". Combined with a substantial marketing campaign, the project would be their largest initiative since Turner acquired H-B. Turner Home Entertainment President Philip Kent claimed \"Quest\" would be a \"consumer-products bonanza\", and the company considered \"Real Adventures\" the linchpin of the \"Quest\" revival. \"Real Adventures\", the live-action film, and release of classic episodes on VHS would constitute a \"Year of \"Jonny Quest\"\" marketing blitz. Delayed until 1996, the project echoed 1994's \"Year of the \"Flintstones\"\" and 1995's \"Year of \"Yogi Bear\"\". Production on \"Real Adventures\" commenced in 1993. Turner hired a team led by director Dick Sebast, writer Peter Lawrence, and art director Takashi Masunaga. The firm appointed Stephanie Sperber head of the \"Quest\" task force in 1994.\n\nHanna-Barbera President Fred Seibert allowed Lawrence to create a new team of companions for Jonny, but Lawrence chose to revive the original group. Sebast and Lawrence decided to make the series as realistic as possible through accurate physics and depictions of machinery. Lawrence emphasized believability, eschewing \"ridiculous ...laser guns\" for real sidearms. The creative team researched child psychology, ensuring they could depict realistic action and consequences without fueling nightmares. Seibert described the show's theme as \"\"The X-Files\" for kids\", citing difficult questions and mysteries to be posed in each episode. Departures from the classic series included new character designs and the introduction of a new character to the \"Quest\" family. Takashi designed Jonny to be \"edgy and handsome\", and rendered characters in the style of Japanese animation to differentiate from American superhero cartoons. The team used a new character—Race's daughter, Jessie Bannon—to create conflict with Jonny. She was introduced in \"Jonny's Golden Quest\" as Race's daughter by Jezebel Jade. Lawrence initially titled the show \"Jonny Quest's Extraordinary Adventures\", but the title changed in 1995 to its final name. Intended for a 1995 release with 65 episodes, \"Real Adventures\" fell into development hell; roughly 30 scripts and only eight reels were in progress by March 1995. Both Lawrence and Takashi were removed in 1996, hiring John Eng and Cosmo Anzilotti to finish the first twenty-six episodes. Certain sequences necessitated exhaustive work and heavy revision.\n\nA new team led by David Lipman, Davis Doi, and Larry Houston finished twenty-six more for broadcast as a separate series named \"The New Jonny Quest\". Time Warner's acquisition of Turner negated this plan, leading to the episodes' release as the second season of \"Real Adventures\". Fred Seibert touted \"Quest\" as the \"\"Home Alone\" of adventure\", with \"high-tech, multicultural themes\" that would appeal to contemporary youth. Promoters promised the new \"Quest\" would avoid \"mindless violence, chauvinism, xenophobia and insensitivity\", addressing historical criticisms of the classic series. Turner also claimed that \"Quest\" would appeal to any gender, stating, \"Traditionally, action adventure animation may be stronger with boys, but in this case, storylines are being developed to draw girls in ... we're really hoping for a wide berth of viewership.\"\n\nPeter Lawrence aimed to \"go beyond cartooning and into animated film-making\" for the show's storytelling. Producers contracted seven studios to animate the first season, including Pacific Animation Co. in Japan and Toon's Factory in France. Japanese and Korean animators drew traditional cel sequences and added color; an international team handled digital post-production and QuestWorld scenes. Teva, a subsidiary of Total Group, organized a post-production team in Paris, led by Eric Jacquot, Gilles Deyries, and Pascal Legeay. Using video post-production high-end specialized tools, including \"Henry\", \"Spirit\", \"Flame\", and others, the team strove to deliver a high-speed computer editing and post-production process. The majority of the first season's footage was digitally inked and painted to enhance background elements. Producers applied the process in excess of twenty hours per episode, adding light effects, rain, snow, glitter, reflections, and fog.\n\nHanna-Barbera implemented a new computer system to combine manual animation with digital paint, and to provide camera movement flexibility, which created a partial three-dimensional effect. Takashi felt the system made the creative team \"honest filmmakers\" through hands-on production. Lawrence described the system in 1995:\n\nThis is the same group that set up and maintained the in-house digital ink and paint systems for Hanna Barbera as well as the Avid and Pro Tools systems used in Post Production. The group was founded and managed by Stephen Toback. \"Real Adventures\" maintained the classic show's realistic violence, featuring off-screen deaths of villains and allies. Japan-based Mook Studios exclusively animated the second season without digital post-processing. The show's format dictated that title sequences be aired first, followed by a short introduction, the first act, and the second act, with commercial breaks between.\n\nBodie Chandler directed music for \"Quest\", and Gary Lionelli, Thomas Chase, Stephen Rucker, Lawrence H. Brown, Guy Moon, Kevin Kiner, Christophe Beck, and Mark Koval wrote incidental music and cues. Lionelli conceived a new main theme based on the original 1960s \"Jonny Quest\" theme by Hoyt Curtin. Composer Guy Moon considered working for the show the \"hardest thing I've done in my life\" due to the producers' demands for epic music: \"They want a big orchestra with a good synth rig... It's great because they push me so much I'll probably replace my whole demo reel with 'Jonny Quest' music... It's hip and it's current.\" Stephen Rucker and Thomas Chase (who later composed in \"The Powerpuff Girls\") used MIDI to facilitate composing. Chase appreciated the producers' commitment to scoring, noting, \"For many kids, animation music is their first exposure to orchestral music.\"\n\nProducers cultivated an element of virtual reality through QuestWorld, a cyberspace simulation rendered with three-dimensional computer animation and motion capture. QuestWorld was designed as a futuristic application of contemporary technology, similar to the classic series' high-tech lasers, satellites, and robots. Seibert traced its origin to \"the same problem that James Bond has... When you look at even his newest gadgets, they're somewhat quaint.\" H-B marketers polled children on their familiarity with virtual reality, discovering that each child was aware of the concept. Planners took inspiration from cyberpunk novels written by Neal Stephenson and William Gibson, including \"Snow Crash\". Short, independent QuestWorld segments called \"Quest Bytes\" concluded certain episodes.\n\nQuestWorld characters were created as wire frame models, augmented with faces scanned from clay busts, then digitally painted and inked. Animation company Buzz F/X, based in Montreal and Santa Monica, created first season sequences. Work began in April 1996 with the opening titles—a gliding journey through a canyon of green, cartographic lines with scenes illuminated upon the walls. Buzz F/X used mostly inexperienced animators, as budgetary constraints would not permit hiring seasoned employees.\nWork followed on \"Escape to Questworld\" and \"Trouble on the Colorado\" as animators worked 12 hours a day, six days a week in a small garage with inadequate computers. Buzz F/X augmented the small team in July with ten recruits, but only two were experienced. Amateur employees struggled with lighting, and with synchronizing jerky motion capture from the House of Moves in Venice Beach; \"Quest\" was their first capture production order. By August, the team was working 14 hours a day, seven days a week, including full nights and mornings.\n\nAfter two more episodes, Buzz F/X terminated its unprofitable contract with H-B, later filing for bankruptcy in 1997 due to $3.6 million of debt created by work on \"Quest\". H-B hired Blur Studio to finish the second season's scenes on a ten-week production schedule. Blur used Intergraph hardware, and its sharp performance attracted press attention and sealed an amicable relationship with H-B. Both companies produced in total roughly one hundred minutes of computer animation for QuestWorld.\n\nTurner Entertainment promoted the series in forty countries and fourteen languages to establish international markets. Broadcasters included Antena 3 in Spain, TF1 in France, Channel One in Russia, RAI in Italy, Taurus Film in Germany, the BBC in the United Kingdom and Asia Television in ten Asian countries, representing ATL's first animated series to be broadcast in both English and Cantonese. Turner planned to introduce US-style animation to the Asian market through \"Quest\". The show was launched in Singapore on TCS Channel 5 (now known as MediaCorp Channel 5) to take advantage of Singapore's \"sophisticated retail sector and well-developed licensing industry\". \"Brandweek\" reported in 1995 that the show's budget, including merchandising and promotional costs, topped $40 million.\n\nDirector Richard Donner, producer Lauren Shuler Donner, and Jane Rosenthal purchased rights for a live-action film, having expressed interest in the property after Turner acquired H-B. Peter Segal was attached to direct. Slated to begin production in mid-1995, filming was delayed until 1996 and ultimately never began. Turner advertised \"Real Adventures\" as the \"next evolution in children's programming ... [redefining] television animation for the next generation.\" The company hosted a 1995 discussion with Peter Lawrence and Takashi at Yanceyville, and later aired previews at United States waterpark events. Staged in major US cities, these \"dive-in theaters\" featured previews of new series and local celebrities, including Jennifer Love Hewitt, Lacey Chabert, Cameron Finley, and Ashley Johnson for the UCLA event. Turner announced all the debut countries and TV stations as of May 1, 1996:\n\nTurner aired \"Real Adventures\" seven nights a week on TBS, TNT, and Cartoon Network for an unprecedented 21 weekly showings. Turner aired several commercial spots featuring the \"Quest\" logo and show introductions to build viral support. Turner's marketers surmised that juvenile groups watching TNT in the morning, TBS in the afternoon, or Cartoon Network in prime time and late night were mutually exclusive. \"Real Adventures\" premiered August 26, 1996, three months after a twenty-hour \"Farewell Marathon\" of original \"Quest\".\n\nThe show averaged a 2.0 Nielsen rating over August and September 1996, considered a strong start for an animated series. Though Cartoon Network suffered declining viewership in 1996, \"Quest\" was consistently one of the highest-rated programs; later season-one episodes drew around 650,000 viewers. \"Real Adventures\"s merchandise performed poorly, and it failed to build consistent ratings in its targeted demographics (though it did attract adult audiences). Turner tried to revive interest in February 1997 with a contest for an adventurous trip to Jamaica called \"Quest World Adventure\".\n\nCartoon Network did not order new episodes beyond the 52nd. Reruns aired for two years on Toonami until September 24, 1999, on Cartoon Network in other formats until 2004; and on CNX until 2003.\nFrom January 8, with episodes like Heroes to Bloodlines to February 2006 with Episodes like Eclipse to More Than Zero until March 26, 2006, Cartoon Network briefly revived the show on its Adult Swim block, where it ran at 4:00 am Eastern time. The series ran again on Adult Swim from August 6, to November 26, 2006, on Sundays at 4:30 am Eastern time.\n\nThe show's premise is that Dr. Quest, a famous phenomenologist, investigates mysterious occurrences and exotic locales with his son, Jonny Quest, adopted son Hadji Singh, bodyguard Race Bannon, Race's daughter Jessie, and pet bulldog Bandit. \"Real Adventures\" is set a few years after the classic series, making Jonny and his friends teenagers. Lawrence aimed to use \"existing, real phenomenon\"—such as the \"Airstrips of Nazca, the Ruins of Teotihuacan or the possible existence of Giant Squid\"—to capture audiences' curiosity. Stressing plausibility, he suggested writers cover real-world enigmas, cryptozoology, unique locales, an alien posing as the vice president, and fictional but \"believable\" mysteries. The Quests would frequently visit the virtual environment of QuestWorld, and encounter the villainous Jeremiah Surd and Ezekiel Rage. Paralyzed years prior by Race's SWAT team, Surd would try to exact revenge through technology; Rage—a former government agent left for dead on a botched mission—would try to destroy the world with nuclear terrorism.\n\nThe Quests would sparingly fight \"monsters of the week\", instead battling antagonists whose conflicts lay in \"personal objective or ambition ... opposed by Dr. Quest\". Lawrence stationed the family at a new compound on the coast of Maine, replete with houses, barns, and workshops. Rooms suited for each character included a library for Dr. Quest, workshop for Jonny, computer-equipped den for Jessie, dojo and gym for Race, and lighthouse lookout for Hadji's meditation. Lawrence equipped Dr. Quest with a fleet of air, land, and sea vehicles, including a 1940s biplane and state-of-the-art catamaran named \"Questor\" with diving bells and smaller research vessels stored in the hulls. Peter Lawrence prided \"Real Adventures\" on the strength of its writing, opining that \"very few writers in this or any other field actually write visually,\" and contesting that each episode would have \"enough material or potential to develop into a movie\".\n\n Peter Lawrence described Jonny as a \"hero in training\" on the cusp of adulthood. He remarked that Jonny possessed \"a straight-ahead, right-on attitude\" free of introspection or self-doubt.\n\nJonny Quest:\n\nJonny Quest, age 14, he's a confident problem-solver that's prone to getting in trouble. Writers framed him as more an intuitive thinker than an intellectual, and created tension by contrasting his father's academic leanings with Jonny's affinity for Race's daring lifestyle. Jonny inherited his father's driving curiosity (rendering him a \"walking query\"), as well as his mother's \"restless, adventurous spirit\". Takashi designed Jonny to be lean, wiry, athletic, and coordinated. Creative directors centered episodes around Jonny; Seibert summarized the shift:\n\nHadji:\n\nHadji Quest, age 16, became Dr. Quest's personal assistant, lacking his mentor's formal education but sharing his burning interest in archaeology, anthropology and the paranormal. A Hindu, as mentioned in the original series episode \"Riddle Of The Gold,\" and a yogi, he held a fatalistic attitude towards the show's drama, reacting to situations \"from the philosophical point of view that everything is as it's supposed to be\". Hadji often used wise aphorisms, taken from diverse cultures and sources and sometimes baffling Jonny. Lawrence cut Hadji's classic telekinesis to align his abilities with realistic yogi practices. \"He doesn't say things like 'Sim, Sim Sala Bim' anymore,\" season one voice actor Michael Benyaer explained. \"The writers and producers actually researched the actual yogic powers. He can do more plausible stuff. There is an episode where Hadji pretends to stop his breathing so that the bad guys think he is dead.\" Takashi drew Hadji taller and thinner than his classic counterpart.\n\nJessie Bannon:\n\nJessie Bannon, age 15, was characterized to be just as tough, smarter, and more thoughtful than Jonny. Written as \"more of an egghead\", she elected to spend time with Dr. Quest as Jonny did with Race, and was \"more in tune with Hadji\". Turner conceived Jessie as cool, independent, and a strong role model for contemporary girls. Peter Lawrence took pains to ensure Jessie would not be written as \"a guy in a skirt\", and made her more mature than Jonny.\n\nRace Bannon:\n\nRace Bannon (Jessie's father) age 38, retained his classic, laconic sense of humor and fearless, dependable nature. He retired from government work over ethical scruples with his former intelligence agency. Writers noted that Race was helplessly overprotective of Jessie, and Jonny was \"the boy Race never had\". Race was also given a western-US accent and a knack for crafting elaborate, colorful similes. Peter Lawrence sculpted Race to be a \"cowboy philosopher or philosopher-warrior\". Writers tasked Race with physical and self-defense training for the Quest team.\n\nDr. Benton Quest:\n\nDr. Benton Quest, age 55, retired from government research and operated from the \"Quest Compound\" on the coast of Maine. Driven by curiosity, he was \"consulted by individuals, governments and corporations\" to investigate enigmatic events. Described as \"single-minded—almost to the point of obsession—in his pursuit of knowledge\", he often encountered trouble as \"his drive to learn blanks out more basic instincts like self-preservation.\" Jessie appreciated his ponderous sense of humor. The show's promoters summarized him as the \"benevolent king\" archetype.\n\nBandit\n\nBandit the family dog also appeared in the series. Lawrence removed Bandit's clownish origins, stressing that Bandit could not understand English, nor reliably save the family from perilous situations.\n\nSummarizing the group's behavior, Lawrence wrote, \"Jonny's response to danger will be close to Race's. Jessie's intrigue with mysterious, unexplained phenomena will be close to Dr. Quest's and Hadji, with his roots in a different culture and a more spiritual approach to life, is different again.\"\n\nTakashi designed each character as physically fit and well-sculpted to reflect \"a more exercise-oriented society\". Fred Seibert downplayed worries that the new characters would disappoint cult fans of the classic series. He hoped \"Real Adventures\" would find success as new interpretations of comic book heroes had done.\n\nSeason two directors Larry Houston and Davis Doi changed the show to resemble the classic franchise. Writer Glenn Leopold revived Hadji's latent psionic powers—including spoon-bending and rope tricks—as he felt the first season's realism was \"not that interesting to watch\". All characters lost a year in age; Jonny became 13. Writer Lance Falk returned Race to governmental guard duty, sealed by an episodic visit with classic \"Quest\" spymaster Phil Corven. Race lost his western accent (with Falk even comparing Race's western accent to Batman having a French accent), and Dr. Quest regained his classic red hair and exhibited rudimentary combat skills. Falk regarded Jessie as the \"missing piece needed to complete the Quest family\", and Leopold added slight romantic overtones to episodes. Some fans complained about changes to Jessie, criticized as a damsel in distress with stereotypically female pink clothes. Jonny saved Jessie from danger several times. Falk defended his portrayal as giving her realistic, human fears, such as claustrophobia. Censors asked the second season team to replace firearms with dart guns, notably in the episode \"General Winter\".\n\nSecond season writers took greater creative liberties with \"Real Adventures\", invoking ghosts, other dimensions, and megalomaniacal schemes. Leopold and Falk sought to create a \"slam-bang adventure show with real monsters\" and heightened narrative emphasis on Jonny and his friends. Falk explained that cool contrivances took precedence over accuracy, stating that \"\"Jonny Quest\" is a show with one foot in the \"fantastic\", and one foot solidly based in reality.\" Opposed to QuestWorld, the new team was nonetheless contractually obligated to use it in their episodes.\n\nFalk felt that virtual reality undermined the show's \"strong connection to reality\", and suggested that after so many dangerous incidents Dr. Quest would have turned the system off. Writers brought back several classic characters, including Pasha the Peddler, Jezebel Jade, Dr. Zin and his twin daughters, Anaya and Melana. Falk honored \"Quest\" creator Doug Wildey by creating an eponymous grandfather for Jonny in the episode \"Nuclear Netherworld\", as well as homage to William Hanna's birthstate of New Mexico where Jonny's grandfather resides. The team created Estella Velasquez as Jessie's mother to retcon the telefilms, feeling that Jade would never get married. Writers eventually killed off villains Ezekiel Rage and Dr. Jeremiah Surd in favor of new adversaries. Comparing \"Quest\" without Zin to \"James Bond without S.P.E.C.T.R.E.\", Falk penned a season finale featuring classic robot spies and a visceral fight between Dr. Quest and Zin. Falk planned to resuscitate Palm Key as the \"Quest\" home in new episodes. Cartoon Network did not renew \"Real Adventures\", despite a pledge to explore the history of Jonny's mother Rachel in the season premiere.\n\nThe first season of \"Real Adventures\" featured J. D. Roth as Jonny, George Segal as Dr. Quest, Robert Patrick as Race, Jesse Douglas as Jessie, Michael Benyaer as Hadji, and veteran voice actors Frank Welker and Michael Bell as Dr. Jeremiah Surd and Ezekiel Rage, respectively. A childhood fan of the original series, J.D. Roth was inspired by Turner's vision for the new series and swiftly accepted the role of Jonny. Roth was attracted by Jonny's \"star quality\", and approved of his characterization as a real kid without superpowers. He enjoyed Jonny's infectious enthusiasm and impulsive alacrity. Roth also admired the show's educational quality, something he had tried to integrate in his personal television pilots. When asked about how he played the relationship with Jonny's father, he commented, \"Jonny is crazy about his dad. He looks up to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr. Quest knows that Jonny is going to be something really special.\" Michael Benyaer also enjoyed playing Hadji: \"[he] is one of the few roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy. I mean, how many East Indian heroes have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive kids out there. He is the outsider in all of us.\" A \"Star Wars\" fan, Benyaer was happy to work with Mark Hamill for \"In the Realm of the Condor\". Peter Lawrence's request for an Indian-descended voice actor was seen as an \"unusual case of multi-ethnic casting\".\n\nThe producers struggled to cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, who he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence—\"[Jesse Douglas] has immense energy, huge energy, and is the kind of woman who could do all the kind of things Jessie could do—you know, athletic, smart, so and so forth \"[sic]\".\" Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis. When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, \"I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard for the rest of the storyline.\" Roth supported her, claiming that \"Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with...I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend.\" H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults \"there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on.\" Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having \"a real family feeling about it... I'd never seen this stuff before. That was quite remarkable.\"\n\nHanna-Barbera bought out the first cast's contracts and hired new actors for the second season. This cast featured Quinton Flynn as Jonny, John de Lancie as Dr. Quest, Granville Van Dusen (for the first two episodes) and Robert Foxworth as Race, Jennifer Hale as Jessie, and Rob Paulsen as Hadji. Paulsen previously voiced Hadji in \"The New Adventures of Jonny Quest\" and the two \"Quest\" telefilms. Don Messick was hired to reprise his classic role as Dr. Quest, but was forced into retirement by a stroke during early sessions. Van Dusen voiced Bannon in the 1986 \"Quest\" series, and Foxworth took over the part after auditioning for Dr. Quest. Frank Welker, Michael Bell and B.J. Ward reprised their respective roles as Surd, Rage and Iris (the QuestWorld A.I.) in the second season.\n\nThroughout the two seasons, several notable guest stars included Kevin Conroy, Earl Boen, Clancy Brown, Robert Ito, James Shigeta, Irene Bedard, Lucy Liu, Brock Peters, Tristan Rogers, Edward Asner, Julian Sands, Helene Udy, Mayim Bialik, Mark Hamill, Andreas Katsulas, Jeffrey Tambor, Dorian Harewood, Clive Revill, Kenneth Mars, Nick Chinlund, George Kennedy, Clyde Kusatsu, Dean Jones, Thomas Gibson, Sarah Douglas and Carl Lumbly. Season two writer Lance Falk has also regretted not thinking about veteran voice actor John Stephenson, who was the very first voice of Dr. Quest, for a guest role.\n\nTurner launched a massive marketing campaign to promote \"Real Adventures\", intending to reach 80% of American children aged six to eleven. Each Turner network spent $5 to $7 million for a total $20 million invested in promotion; the company contracted 33 licensees. Other reports pegged the budget at $40 million, and \"Marketing Week\" estimated that the series launched with $300 million of merchandising support. \"The Wall Street Journal\" called \"Quest\" a \"property to watch\" in 1995; \"People\" and \"Good Housekeeping\" considered it a surefire blockbuster. Turner provided digital and bound style guides featuring collections of \"Quest\" artwork, coloring instructions, and product ideas.\n\nProduced for $100,000 and believed to be the first of its kind, the digital style guide included fonts, logos, character art, merchandising mock-ups, voice clips, and other interactive content. Hanna-Barbera launched \"Questworld.com\" as the show's internet hub, presenting it as if written by members of the Quest team. Complementing the show's educational, real-world premise, the site hosted links to academic, archaeological, and exploratory websites. Turner announced 32 licensees as of summer 1996:\n\nTurner marketed \"Real Adventures\" through a substantial diversity of products, considering its \"Quest\" campaign a role model for future shows. Galoob acquired figurine licensing rights in 1995 and created a product line of vehicles, figures, and Micro Machines for fall 1996 release. Turner felt that Galoob's commitment legitimized the \"Quest\" marketing plan, and next secured partnership with Pizza Hut and food retailers. Pillsbury included $3 mail-in rebates for future \"Quest\" videos, display contests, and instant coupon offers on over 20 million packages. Campbell Soup Company released six holographic miniature posters on the same number of SpaghettiOs cans; the posters were awarded in \"Converting\" in 1997. General Mills outfitted boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch with offers for T-shirts and other items. Over five thousand Pizza Hut restaurants held a two-month-long give-away of figurines with meals during the show's launch. Galoob failed to build popularity for its toys outside the United States, and discontinued the line in 1997.\n\nUpper Deck Company used art, sketches, and plots from the first season to create a sixty-piece card collection. Turner also marketed Zebco fishing poles bearing the \"Quest\" logo. Kid Rhino produced a cassette audio adventure based on the episode \"Return of the Anasazi\". The show's credits advertised a soundtrack available from Rhino, never sold or otherwise promoted. Turner listed several products in a \"Quest Adventure Value Pack\" coupon catalogue.\n\nMarketers tied in classic \"Quest\" merchandise, launching a classic H-B promotion with Days Inn hotels, Planet Hollywood restaurants, and Little Debbie snack cakes and offering rebates for \"Cyber Insects\" and classic episodes. The marketing campaign culminated with the release of eight VHS \"Real Adventures\" season one episodes. Turner also released two episodes on laserdisc. Metropolitan newspapers worked with Turner to promote the videos through grab-bag give-aways. Turner sold merchandise through several international distributors, and expected to make a $60 million profit per year in the Asia-Pacific region alone.\n\nSavoy Brands International handled South American distribution, involving 750,000 retail outlets in Argentina, Chile, Peru, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador and Columbia. Turner debuted \"Quest\" at a cocktail party for the European Licensing Fair in late 1996, and released merchandise in Europe through 90,000 retail outlets over the next six months. Copyright Promotions Licensing Group handled lincensing in the United Kingdom. Turner ensured that the license agreements forbade retailers from discounting \"Quest\" items. The size of the marketing initiative left one newspaper reviewer wondering, \"are [the Quests] back because they're too cool to die, or because they're too well known to be squandered as a licensing product?\" Turner worried that the promotion might overhype the brand, and timed commercial rollouts over the life of the show. H-B chief Fred Seibert expected high sales and success:\n\nTerry Bisson and others working under the alias \"Brad Quentin\" produced 11 original novellas featuring adventure and virtual reality themes. Critics appreciated that the books may have drawn kids to reading, especially those interested in technology. Only certain comics and coloring books used season two's designs, such as Dark Horse's \"Countdown to Chaos\", featuring General Vostok. Turner stopped marketing the show until April 2004, when Warner Home Video released episodes \"Escape to Questworld\" and \"Trouble on the Colorado\" as \"TV Premiere DVD: The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest\" on MiniDVD.\n\nVirgin Sound and Vision produced an adventure game for the series named \"Cover-Up At Roswell\", released in August 1996. Known as \"Escape from Quest World\" in development, \"Roswell\" cost $1 million to make. Virgin handled all marketing, sales, and distribution; Turner cross-promoted. Developers recycled fifty minutes of footage and art from six season one episodes to construct a new story about the Quest family gathering alien artifacts and saving an extraterrestrial from autopsy at The Pentagon. Jeremiah Surd and the Men in Black of General Tyler plan to misuse the technology and try to hinder the Quests. Gameplay consists of clicking areas on images of locations to navigate paths. Players sometimes encounter minigames, such as guiding a diving bell away from rocks or shooting rats with a slingshot. Virgin designed certain segments to be viewed with packaged stereostopic Chromatek plastic glasses.\n\nVirgin estimated the game would provide 20–25 hours of game play for adults and 80–100 hours for children. The season two cast provided all voices except for Michael Benyaer as Hadji and Charles Howerton as Dr. Quest. The game's music featured a \"high-intensity orchestral sound\" prone to monotony. One reviewer praised \"Roswell\" for \"good entertainment and variety\", but regretted low replay value and no modes of difficulty. Critics were divided over the puzzles, naming them both \"ingenious\" and \"elementary\". Peter Scisco of ComputerLife and FamilyPC's testers criticized some of the puzzles for relying on \"reflexes, not logical thinking\".\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" rated the game B+, naming the puzzles \"unimaginative...Pac-Man rip-offs and dopey jigsaws\". Scisco appreciated the nonviolent content and the inclusion of Jessie as a strong female character, but considered the extraterrestrial story too familiar. A writer from the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" warned against buying the game for easily frightened children, but recommended it for those who enjoy mental challenges.\n\nTurner, TBS, and Holiday Inn partnered to hold an essay contest as part of the Safe America Foundation's \"Quest for Safety\" drive. From October 9 to November 4, 1996, spots encouraged children to write essays about important safety issues and personal safety. A panel of public safety and community leaders selected the winner, dubbing them the \"Safest Kid in America\". TBS posted the winner's essay to the kids section of its website and awarded them a position on the \"Real Adventures\" float for the 1997 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena. Second-prize winners received bicycle helmets, T-shirts, and \"Jonny Quest\" lapel pins. Turner staged an international contest in February 1997 called \"Quest World Adventure\", featuring the grand prize of a trip to a \"secret island\" (Jamaica) in July to take part in a staged dramatic scenario.\n\nCommercials instructed fans to mail in episodes' geographical destinations during sweeps week. Advertisements appeared through Time Warner's television channels, \"Sports Illustrated for Kids\", DC Comics publications, radio stations, and Warner Brothers stores. The contest marked the first time that Cartoon Network U.S., TNT Europe, Cartoon Network Europe, Cartoon Network Asia, and Cartoon Network Latin America united for a single promotion. Turner encouraged local cable operators to submit their own spots, generating 34,000 ads among 174 cable systems for a total of $3.4 million cross-channel media support. 50,000 children with a median age of ten entered the competition, and 20,000 answered correctly. Turner selected ten viewers from the United States and nine from Latin America and Asia as grand-prize winners. They and two-hundred others received \"Quest\"-themed adventure packs, including a backpack, flashlight and siren, travel journal, pen, T-shirt, and glow sticks. Cartoon Network aired the names of winning children on a special feature in which Jeremiah Surd issued personal threats.\n\nWinners received all-expenses-paid trips to Ocho Rios, Jamaica, with up to three family members. Planners kept the destination secret until shortly before travel. In Jamaica, kids combated Surd's \"environmental terrorism\" by preventing him from finding the Jamaican \"Irie\" stones. Children received clues on the mission through e-mails seemingly written by Jonny Quest. Posing as allies, network employees prepared clues, buried treasure, and hosted barbecues, reggae concerts, and rafting trips. Participants searched for the stones at the White River, Dunn's River Falls, and Prospect Plantation; hosts filmed the proceedings for possible future promotions. The quest centered on cerebral challenges and puzzles. Attendees also learned about the history and ecology of Jamaica. The adventure doubled the show's ratings for February sweeps and tripled \"Questworld.com\"s hits. \"Brandweek\" awarded it the year's top honors for a global marketing promotion.\n\nOn October 8, 1996, Turner Home Entertainment and the Cartoon Network Video line released all four volumes of the series on VHS, \"The Alchemist\", \"Rage's Burning Wheel\", \"The Darkest Fathoms\" and \"Escape to Questworld\", with each videocassette containing two episodes along with two bonus shorts from the \"What a Cartoon!\" series. Warner Home Video released only \"Escape to Questworld\" on MiniDVD in April 2004, then WHV (via Hanna-Barbera Productions and Warner Bros. Family Entertainment) released the first thirteen episodes on February 17, 2009 as \"Season 1, Volume 1 of The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest\" on DVD in Region 1. On March 27, 2012, Warner Archive released \"The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest: Season 1, Volume 2\" on DVD in Region 1 as part of their Hanna–Barbera Classics Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner's online store and Amazon.com. The complete second (and final) season was released to DVD on November 10, 2015 from Warner Archive. All 52 episodes were made available for digital purchase in 2013 on the iTunes Store. Note: This is also the most recent show to be released under the Hanna-Barbera banner on DVD all subsequent shows would use the Cartoon Network banner.\n\nAnnouncement of Jessie Bannon's inclusion caused backlash among \"Quest\" fans. \"TV Guide\"'s editors feared that Jonny and Jessie would become romantically entangled, declaring her an \"icky female\". H-B Chief Fred Seibert responded, \"Jessie is a little older and smarter than Jonny... We're not doing \"Moonlighting\" here.\" Seibert also denied that Jessie had been created solely to appeal to little girls, citing extant support for Jonny and the classic team. A \"Miami Herald\" columnist called Jessie an \"effort to rewrite the past to conform to the sociopolitical mandates of the present\" and political correctness \"run amok\". \"Billboard\" conversely welcomed the change over an all-male cast. The fiasco subsided after the \"Cyber Insects\" telefilm aired; the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" rebuffed the \"icky girl\" label, as Jessie saved Jonny's life and taught him patience. A test screening of \"Cyber Insects\" to males revealed that though some questioned her addition, most understood that like certain elements criticized in the original series, it was a reflection of the times.\n\nSome fans still took issue with the series' distance from classic \"Quest\", which suffered accusations of cultural insensitivity and \"racial and sexual stereotypes\". \"Real Adventures\" evoked critical comparisons to the original series. \"Cinefantastique\" felt \"Real Adventures\" remained true to the classic show's formula, and praised the \"impressive\" cast. Another critic recommended the show to \"die-hard adult fans\", affirming that \"Real Adventures\" maintained the violence and off-screen deaths of the old series, as even the opening titles featured \"explosions, murder and mayhem\". \"The Washington Post\" judged the first season as \"grittier and more lifelike\" than the original \"Quest\". \"Chicago Tribune\" critic Allan Johnson agreed that \"Real Adventures\" was less \"way-out\" and contrasted the shows in detail. \"TV Guide\" applauded the writing as \"miles deeper and darker than on the old show\"; Hadji's quotations impressed the magazine's reviewer. Chicago's \"Daily Herald\" called the first episode \"vintage \"Quest\"\", and \"The Panama City Times-Herald\" echoed this position:\n\nHanna-Barbera founder and chairman Joseph Barbera considered \"Real Adventures\" a \"disaster\" because of changes to the characters and stories. He conceded, \"that's their business. Everybody needs to do their own thing.\" Critics generally enjoyed the characters and voice acting. \"People\" liked the cast, particularly George Segal. \"Saturday Morning Fever\" praised Jessie Bannon for her resemblance to Dr. Quest. Allan Johnson approved of the age jump, as Jonny and Hadji were now old enough to be part of the action. He considered Jessie \"cool... she gives Jonny grief just because she can, and she's not afraid of the action.\" He did not enjoy the \"toned down\" portrayal of Race Bannon. Some fans objected to Race's Western accent in the first season. Peter Lawrence defended the portrayal of Race as a \"man of action, not thought—though perfectly capable of deep thought\", noting that his accent and mannerisms encouraged variety, surprise, and originality.\n\nThe quality of \"Quest\"s traditional and computer animation split critics. The \"Toronto Star\" scathingly criticized the show for \"facile plots heavily laced with jarring science fiction and incongruous computer animation\", naming QuestWorld a \"poorly explained techno-gimmick.\" \"Le Figaro\" concurred, but praised QuestWorld for capturing the attention of young viewers. \"The Star\" praised QuestWorld, but regarded traditional sequences as \"flat and textureless, with minimal characterization, unnaturally stiff movement, and poor execution of shading and shadow\". Ted Cox of the \"Chicago Daily Herald\" agreed that animated motion was sometimes \"remarkably uneven\", but lauded realistic imagery like \"the play of light on the ocean\". \"TV Guide\" also found the animation somewhat flat, but considered the sound effects and backgrounds to be state-of-the-art.\n\nThe show's sound was warmly received by the industry. Episodes \"Nuclear Netherworld\" and \"Alien in Washington\" were nominated respectively for music and sound editing Golden Reel Awards in 1997, and the entire series was nominated for an animated sound editing Golden Reel Award in 1998. \"Real Adventures\" was also nominated for a 1997 Daytime Emmy Award for music direction and composition. Special effects director Alberto Menache criticized QuestWorld in \"Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Video Games\", considering it a mistake-laden failure. He explained that the size difference between the motion capturers and the characters caused unsteady animation and shaking, consequently mismatching interaction with props and uneven terrain.\n\nMenache blamed the show's budget, which did not allow for digital post-production and review; producers instead expected \"plug-and-play\" results straight from the capture studio. Menache concluded that the QuestWorld sequences suffered from a \"pipeline set up for mass production\" with little testing or planning. \"Quest\"s Senior Vice President of Production Sherry Gunther admitted that the motion capture technology was \"a little crude\" and best suited for broad movements. Menache was less critical of the facial capture, considering it \"medium-quality\" but still unacceptable given H-B's resources. These criticisms mirrored the comments of Buzz F/X animator Francois Lord, who cited inexperienced Montreal animators and rushed production schedules. He pointed out that Blur Studios had more time, money, and experience for season two's sequences.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2221777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221777", "title": "Kustom Amplification", "text": "Kustom Amplification\n\nKustom Amplification or Kustom Electronics is a manufacturer of guitar and bass amplifiers and PA equipment and accessories. Since 1999, Kustom has been owned by the Hanser Music Group headquartered in Cincinnati; Ohio, which also ownswww.powerwerks.com.\n\n\"Kustom\" was a brand and trademark of Ross, Inc., a company founded in 1964 by Charles A. \"Bud\" Ross in Chanute, Kansas. The main selling point of Kustom amplifiers was their unique appearance: Ross, Inc. was the first to mass-produce amplifiers covered in roll and pleat, popularly referred to as \"Tuck-And-Roll\" naugahyde, similar to hot-rod automobile upholstery popular at that time. The amplifiers featured solid-state circuitry instead of vacuum tube-based designs so common in the 1960s. \n\nRoss, Inc. operated in a factory in Chanute, Kansas. The company produced several models of guitar amplifiers, bass amplifiers, organ amplifiers, Guitars, Basses, and keyboards and P.A. systems. There was also a line of guitars with DeArmond pickups in a variety of colors, including the infamous Pink to Green sunburst that fans have affectionately named \"Watermelon Burst.\" In an original promotion Kustom gave away \"Kustom Kats\" with the purchase of an amplifier. The Kustom (The Nauga, or Naugie) Kats were from the same Uniroyal Naugahyde that Kustom used to cover their products. The original Kustom amps came in a variety of colors including Red Sparkle, Blue Sparkle, Gold Sparkle, Cascade Sparkle (teal), Charcoal Sparkle (grey), Silver Sparkle (white), and Flat Black (which contained no glitter). Eventually the company branched out to produce organs, drums, microphones, and guitars. \n\nCharles \"Bud\" Ross produced the first Kustom amp which comprised two fifteen inch speakers mounted side-by-side in a horizontal white sparkle cabinet with and a non-Frankenstein head. The first amp was built for a member of the Nebraska Hall of Fame and is now a featured display in the collection of Rainbow Recording Studios in Omaha, Nebraska. The company was owned by Bud Ross from 1964 until June 1972, when Ross sold it to Baldwin Pianos. The sale was finalized just prior to the 1972 Summer NAMM show where the metal/slant face Kustom amps were introduced. Later Bud Ross established a fairly lucrative business which manufactured police handheld radars. During the following years the factory in Kansas and the associated trademarks would change ownership numerous times. The most notable merger happened with Gretsch, which at the time was owned by Baldwin.\n\nAside from the Kustom brand, Kustom Electronics also began to manufacture an amplifier line called Kasino. The brand was established in 1972. These were internally the same as Kustom amplifiers but were covered with traditional Tolex material as seen on Fender style amplifiers. Kasino amps were used mainly by country music performers who felt the regular Kustom Tuck-And-Roll Naugahyde models were too flashy. Another reason for establishing a parallel brand was simply to gain a greater share of the amplifier market. One distributor could sell the Kustom brand and one could sell Kasino without competing with each other. Waylon Jennings was an early supporter of the Kasino line. Kasino amps were discontinued in 1975 when Kustom Electronics once again changed ownership.\n\nOther parallel brands of Kustom Electronics were Klassic and Camco. Klassic was a brief venture that reputedly fell into trademark disputes with Peavey Electronics who happened to own the \"Classic\" trademark. Camco was a brand used for drums.\n\nSome affiliated companies and trademarks were Woodson and Legend. Woodson Electronics, Inc. from Bolivar, Missouri was an independent business entity founded by Mike Woodson in the early 1970s (around the same time when Kustom was acquired by Gretsch). Mike was Bud's brother-in-law and all amps and P.A. systems were manufactured in Bolivar. Several Kustom employees moved to Bolivar to work for Woodson. Legend hybrid amplifiers of Legend Musical Instruments, Inc. from Syracuse, New York were also manufactured by the Kustom factory. Reputedly these were engineered by Richard Newman (an employee of Bonne Music Shop) and a former employee of Woodson Electronics.\n\nKustom abandoned the tuck-n-roll upholstery in the late 1970s. Around the same time the company also changed its logo to a bigger letter \"K.\" Mesa Boogie \"Mark\" series amplifiers appeared in the late 1970s generating a huge impact. Everyone wanted to clone the popular design, including Kustom Electronics. Kustom's answer to the Mark series was a hybrid amplifier series called \"K-Studio.\" The K-Studio was among the last traditional Kustom products, as subsequent Kustom trademark owners no longer had any affiliation with the old Kansas-based company.\n\nToday, Kustom amplifiers are considered fairly collectible and are preferred by some vintage enthusiasts for their solid-state tone. Rockabilly and Motown musicians originally used these amps. Other artists known for using the Kustom brand for live performances are Creedence Clearwater Revival, Hoyt Axton, The Altamonts, Dusty Murphy, 3 and Sheryl Crow. Some of the most famous Kustom P.A. users include Creedence Clearwater Revival, Leon Russell, Johnny Cash, Roy Clark, The Jackson 5, Carl Perkins and The Carpenters. CCR toured from mid-1969 - 1972 using their own massive Kustom 400 PA system due to a lack of quality backline PA systems in venues at that time. As a result, CCR concerts were superior in sound quality, but the cost of transporting the equipment made touring a money losing deal for the band.\n\nHanser Re-issues\n\nHanser Holdings, Inc. from Cincinnati, Ohio bought the bankrupted Kustom in the late 1980s. In 1994, Hanser produced some small solid-state amplifiers featuring tuck-n-roll covering under the Kustom brand. These amps were manufactured in China.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2001 Hanser continued producing Kustom brand tuck-n-roll amplifiers including a full tube guitar amplifier, 100W and a 50W solid state reverb amps called TRT100 and TRT50, a 400W hybrid bass amplifier TRB400H, as well as 2x12\", 4x12\" and 2x15\" speaker cabinets in original tuck-n-roll style.

Bud Ross has had numerous ventures in MI industry (including Road Electronics and Ross Systems). His only venture resembling traditional Kustom amplifiers was a brief venture with his son Andy Ross. The duo founded Krossroad Music Corporation in the early 1990s and for a brief period the company manufactured a series of solid-state bass amplifiers featuring traditional Kustom-style tuck-n-roll cosmetics. The amplifiers were even marketed with the Kustom Kat mascot. The venture proved unsuccessful, however, and within a few years the company had ceased to exist.\n\nGuitars\n\nAs noted above, Kustom also produced a line of guitars in the 1967-1969 designed by Doyle Reading who also designed guitars for Wurlitzer. Model numbers were similar to the amplifiers of the time, with the K-200 being a semi-hollow body instrument with a cats-eye sound hole giving it a somewhat Rickenbacker-style look. It was equipped with two single coil DeArmond pickups, a bound neck, a steel nut, and a rosewood fretboard with multiple dot inlays beginning with four for each position marker below the 12th fret. The guitars came in different colors including natural, white, blue, wineburst aka watermelon burst, cherry-orange sunburst, natural ash, black ash and white ash, and were produced with or without a Bigsby tailpiece. According to Doyle at the 1967 NAMM show in Chicago orders came flooding in which made it hard to meet the demand.\n\n"}

London is 41 miles (66 km) northeast of the town.\n\nIn 2016, Hook had a population of 7,916. Hook railway station currently has direct rail links to both London Waterloo and Basingstoke with indirect routes to Reading, Salisbury, and Southampton. Rail services are provided by South Western Railway.\n\nAmong the businesses located in the village are Serco and Trimble Navigation. Between 2004 and 2006, Hook expanded eastwards with the development of the Holt Park residential district, and from 2020 northeastwards with the Green Hart Park and Oakwood Grange developments.\n\nUntil the 18th century, only a few scattered farms could be found in the area; small hamlets did not begin to appear until inns sprung up to serve travellers. Hook was located on the main London to Exeter stagecoach route. In the late eighteenth century, a turnpike road was constructed to aid the navigation of the steep Scures Hill, to the west of the village. In 1883 Hook railway station was constructed, and the village began to grow with railway workers and commuters settling in Hook.\n\nSt John the Evangelist Parish Church was completed in 1938 replacing the tin tabernacle used by worshippers since 1886. The new Church was designed by Edward Maufe and shows in small scale design features that would later be incorporated by him into Guildford Cathedral. Even the Cathedral fund raising scheme of \"buying a brick\" was first utilised at Hook where the Church retains an impressive list of donors and benefactors. Hook also has a Roman Catholic church and an Evangelical Church. The latter now known as Life Church was originally paid for by the family who founded Burberry; founder Thomas Burberry being a Baptist who died in Hook. The present Life Church Centre was opened in 2011.\n\nHook being a hamlet in the village of Odiham before 1955; the distinct Anglican ecclesiastical parish of Hook was not created before then . It was only in 1943 that permission was given for burials in Hook itself.\n\nHook was considered as part of a scheme to settle Londoners in the country after the Second World War, but Basingstoke was selected for development instead. Recently, the town has grown in size considerably with new housing developments being constructed.\n\nAlthough within of the far larger town of Basingstoke to the west, Hook's development since the 1980s has been rapid. Calls have been made to redevelop the 'village' centre as Hook has few amenities for its size, as it is now generally considered as a town in terms of population and urban expanse.\n\nAffluence is high due to surrounding rural areas, estates, such as Tylney Hall Park and Garden which is Grade II* listed and Hook Common, a large mixture of forest and heathland coupled with excellent transport links.\n\nHook has one of the few national TaxiBus services.\n\nThere is the main line rail station mentioned above and direct access to the M3 motorway, as well as the straight route parallelling the Roman road the A30 connecting local towns such as Basingstoke and Yateley. Southampton Airport is to the south and London Heathrow Airport is away to the northeast. The far smaller Blackbushe Airport municipal air facility is to the east, near Yateley. Many residents commute to the larger local towns of Basingstoke, Winchester, Reading, Camberley, Fleet and Farnborough, with some travelling further afield to Southampton, Bracknell and London.\n\nIn Hook, there are a number of local schools. They are:\n\nThe Hook Schools are supported by the Hook Schools Parents Association (HSPA)and local donors\n\nThere are several annual and monthly community events held in the village:\n\nHook Focus is Hook’s authoritative magazine and since 1973 it has carried news of future Community Events and reports on all that has been happening in Hook. Focus is managed by Hook volunteers and is independent of all other bodies.\n\n"}

The 2021 OC Fair is from 16 July to 15 August.\n\nThe fair first took place in the year 1890 and consisted of some minor exhibits in Santa Ana and a horse race. From 1889 to 1894 the fair was run by the Orange County Community Fair Corporation, but was then taken over by the \"Orange County Fair Association, Inc\". Early fairs mainly consisted of horse races and livestock shows, but around 1900 new carnival-like attractions were added and the fair become a yearly occurrence. The fair was located in Santa Ana, except for a brief interval after World War I, when it was moved to Huntington Beach.\n\nStarting in 1916, the fair was managed by the Orange County Farm Bureau. An Orange County Fair Board was elected in 1925, and the fair was moved to Anaheim with the addition of a rodeo and carnival. From 1932 to 1939, the fair was located in Pomona, California as part of a combined Orange, Los Angeles, and Riverside County Fair. Following World War II the 32nd District Agricultural Association was formed by the state of California, and it took on the task of running the fair. The state purchased land from the Santa Ana Army Air Base and set some of it aside for use as a new fairgrounds. In 1949 the fair became a five-day-long event and was relocated to the old army base, which quickly became the permanent location.\n\nThe city of Costa Mesa was incorporated in 1953 with the fair residing in its boundaries. The fairgrounds' 150 acres has been the home of the fair ever since 1949 and has expanded to an annual 23 day summer event.\n\nOn April 27, 2020 for the first time since 1945, the 2020 fair was cancelled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic; come 2021, hand sanitisers will be installed within the premises, to prevent this and other diseases from spreading.\n\nIn May 2009, then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger recommended the Orange County Fairgrounds be listed for sale. He had decided the fairgrounds were \"surplus or underutilized\" assets, although the Fair hosts more than one million visitors each year and is utilized virtually every day of the week with multiple community activities. \"OC Weekly\" reported, \"What followed was a story of deception by a small group in a position of power within the fairgrounds hierarchy. Through various contractual agreements between people of wealth and power, a move was made to privatize that public land in what members of the Orange County Fairgrounds Preservation Society call one of the largest, most deliberate land grabs in the county's long history of land grabs.\" The Preservation Society quickly stepped in to halt the sale. They contended that the OC legislators in Sacramento had been remiss in intervening to stop the transaction, that the proposed deal to sell public land was both \"Ill-advised and illegal.\" Both the Del Mar Fairgrounds and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum were saved by just such an intervention by the legislators.\n\nA public auction was held, but before any sales agreements could be signed, there were two lawsuits filed and the sale was stopped. The Preservation Society, and Tel Phil Enterprises filed in the Court of Appeal and asked that the new governor Jerry Brown have the sale categorically dismissed. Lawsuits by two former building commissioners that Schwarzenegger had fired, however, stalled the proposed sale long enough for incoming Governor Brown to have the final word.\n\nAfter a closed session on January 27, 2011, the OCFEC Board of Directors issued the following policy statement regarding the sale of the fairgrounds:\nOn February 8, 2011, the 32nd District Agricultural Association sent a letter to Governor Jerry Brown, which can be viewed as a PDF at the site.\n\nIn February 2011, California Governor Jerry Brown told the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"This is not the best time to be selling real estate. I think we have time to consider what we ought to do with that.\" He also said that his predecessor's plan, rather than helping California's budget crisis, would \"have cost taxpayers far more in the long run.\" Assemblyman Jose Solorio (D-Santa Ana) stated that Brown's comments were \"a good sign.\" \n\nThe Orange County Fair is the 9th-largest fair in the United States.\n\nThe Fairground in Costa Mesa has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification \"Csb\"), that is nearly perfect for its many outdoor activities.\n"}
{"id": "2221816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221816", "title": "Chromatics (band)", "text": "Chromatics (band)\n\nChromatics is an American electronic music band from Portland, Oregon, formed in 2001. The band consists of Ruth Radelet (vocals, guitar, synthesizer), Adam Miller (guitar, vocoder), Nat Walker (drums, synthesizer), and Johnny Jewel (producer, multi-instrumentalist). The band originally featured a trademark sound indebted to punk and lo-fi that was described as \"noisy\" and \"chaotic\". After numerous lineup changes, which left guitarist Adam Miller as the sole original member, the band began releasing material on the Italians Do It Better record label in 2007, with their style streamlined into an Italo disco-influenced sound.\n\nTheir third album \"Night Drive\" (2007) was met with critical acclaim, as was their fourth album, \"Kill for Love\", which was released on March 26, 2012. Several of the band's songs have been featured in television series such as \"Bates Motel\", \"Gossip Girl\", \"Mr. Robot\", \"Parenthood\", \"Revenge\", \"Riverdale\", \"13 Reasons Why\", and \"Twin Peaks\", as well as being featured in the films \"Drive\" (2011), \"Taken 2\" (2012), and \"The Perfection\" (2019). In December 2014, the band announced what would have been their fifth studio album, titled \"Dear Tommy.\" While Chromatics have released a number of singles from it, \"Dear Tommy\" had yet to be released when they instead issued the album \"Closer to Grey\" in October 2019.\n\nChromatics' first 7-inch, \"Beach of Infants/Steps\", was a solo project of Adam Miller. It was released by Hand Held Heart. Miller has been Chromatics' sole consistent member. \"Beach of Infants/Steps\" was recorded in Seattle, Washington, on a Tascam 4-track. By the time the 7-inch was released, Chromatics had scaled up to a four-piece.\n\nMiller also played in The Vogue, a group that garnered media attention around Seattle. The Vogue were barely out of high school and created art punk that drew comparisons to The Fall. This band featured Johnny Whitney of The Blood Brothers on vocals and Hannah Blilie who went on to play drums in The Gossip. After The Vogue's keyboardist departed, the remaining members formed Soiled Doves, and released one 7-inch and one album. Although Chromatics began as a solo project for Adam Miller, he quickly added most of The Soiled Doves' lineup. Adam Miller became the vocalist. Devin Welch played guitar. Michelle Nolan, a new addition, played bass guitar Blilie played drums. After releasing their debut album \"Chrome Rats vs. Basement Rutz\" in 2003 on Gold Standard Laboratories, all members except Miller left to form Shoplifting.\n\nMiller and a revamped lineup released the band's second studio album, \"Plaster Hounds\", in 2004 on Gold Standard Laboratories. This lineup featured Adam Miller performing double duty on guitar and vocals, with Nat Sahlstrom on bass and the Get Hustle's Ron Avila on percussion. The lineup changed once again, as Miller played many of the same songs from the \"Plaster Hounds\" era with Lena Okazaki replacing Sahlstrom on bass and a drum machine replacing the free jazz-influenced percussive style of Avila. This lineup of Miller and Okazaki released a few CD-Rs, still in the lo-fi art punk style that had been established, but the addition of the drum machine hinted at the major stylistic shift to come.\n\nWhile Miller's CD-Rs with Okazaki hinted at an electronic direction, Okazaki left the band and Chromatics went through their largest reinvention around 2005, becoming the quartet of Miller, Ruth Radelet, Johnny Jewel, and Nat Walker. This resulted in a gradual but dramatic shift in the band's sound and live performance. Chromatics have often toured the world with labelmates Glass Candy, since Jewel plays in both bands, as well as Desire, a side project of Jewel and Walker. Walker and Jewel also have an instrumental project called Symmetry.\n\nChromatics' third studio album, \"Night Drive\", was released in 2007 on Italians Do It Better, the band's most acclaimed release. On \"Night Drive\", the group ditched their \"hairy noise-rock troupe\" aesthetic in favor of a \"neatly groomed pop-dance quartet\". In their review of the album, \"Pitchfork\" noted that \"the transformation of Chromatics has been so effortless that it's still easy to be wowed by the results\", adding that \"listeners who are only familiar with the band's forays into shambling punk will certainly be surprised by \"Night Drive\"s assured songwriting\".\n\nVarious songs from \"Night Drive\" have been licensed for usage in multiple Hollywood films, television shows, international television and internet advertisements, and runway shows.\n\nOther releases have included the \"Nite\" and \"In Shining Violence\" EPs. In 2007, Chromatics' non-album tracks \"In the City\" and \"Hands in the Dark\", as well as a demo of \"Night Drive\"s \"The Killing Spree\", were featured on the Italians Do It Better compilation album \"After Dark\".\n\nChromatics gained recognition for their song \"Tick of the Clock\" which was used in the film \"Drive\", released in September 2011 by director Nicolas Winding Refn, and its soundtrack, and again in the film \"Taken 2\", released in October 2012 by director Olivier Megaton, and its soundtrack. On December 23, 2011, Jewel and Walker—under the name Symmetry—released \"Themes for an Imaginary Film\", which was described by Pitchfork as Jewel's \"most ambitious project to date: a sprawling, 37-track, two-hour collection of cinematic noir-electro\", featuring contributions from Chromatics and fellow Italians Do It Better acts Glass Candy, Desire and Mirage.\n\nOn October 23, 2011, Chromatics released the title track from their then-upcoming fourth studio album, \"Kill for Love\". Reviews described the single as a \"really hypnotizing, fascinating song that will definitely get you psyched for the record—Ruth Radalet warmly croons her sweet, cryptic confessional lyrics while her band effortlessly weaves a bubbling, dreamy, New Order-esque soundscape.\"\n\n\"The Fader\" mentioned, \"Maybe \"Kill for Love\" will inaugurate a sea change where artists come to terms with themselves and start being open about how they sound when they sing. In basement studios everywhere, young vocalists will blink three times and start x-ing out effects in Ableton, look at the mirror for the first time in weeks, deep into their beady, sun-deprived eyes and whisper, \"God, there are no shortcuts... \"Kill for Love\" continues the band's penchant for popular-sound defiance that made Chromatics so exciting in the first place.\"\n\nAfter waiting patiently, Chromatics have begun to reach fans \"five years after the release of their incredibly prescient \"Night Drive\" album.\" \"Kill for Love\" was featured in the television shows \"Bates Motel\" and \"Gossip Girl\". On February 11, 2012, the band leaked a second track from \"Kill for Love\", \"Into the Black\", a cover of the Neil Young song \"Out of the Blue and Into the Black\", which was featured in the television shows \"Mr. Robot\", \"Revenge\", \"Riverdale\", and \"13 Reasons Why\". Chromatics followed their second leak with three additional tracks, \"Lady\", \"Candy\" and on March 11, 2012 their fifth leak \"Back from the Grave\".\n\nAs fans anticipated the album, Jewel mentioned that the process of creating \"Kill for Love\" resulted in a total of 36 tracks that have been narrowed down to 17 for the album.\n\nChromatics' fourth studio album, \"Kill for Love\", was released on March 26, 2012. The album has been described as sounding like a \"time warp ... a warm collision of past, present, and future.\" On May 7, 2012, the group released an alternative version of \"Kill for Love\" for free download, featuring eleven songs from the original album with no drums or percussion. Songs from the album have been featured in television shows such as \"Bates Motel\", \"Gossip Girl\", \"Mr. Robot\", \"Parenthood\", \"Revenge\", \"Riverdale\", and \"13 Reasons Why\". \"Kill for Love\" was named the eighth best album of 2012 by Pitchfork.\n\nChromatics were invited by Karl Lagerfeld to play the Chanel Spring Summer 2013 fashion show in Paris in early October. The band was put above the runway, overlooking the whole catwalk and creating a dreamy ambience. Chromatics performed about five new and old songs.\n\nOn December 4, 2014, the band announced their fifth studio album, \"Dear Tommy\". The album was preceded by the singles \"Just Like You\", \"I Can Never Be Myself When You're Around\", and \"In Films\".\n\nOn February 3, 2015, Chromatics released the three-track single \"Yes (Love Theme from \"Lost River\")\", which is included in both the trailer and soundtrack for Ryan Gosling's directorial debut, \"Lost River\", and featured in the television show \"Riverdale\". The soundtrack was released on March 30 by Italians Do It Better, while the film was released on April 10. The song \"Shadow\" was made available on September 9. On November 5, Chromatics released seven cover versions of Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\", one which was featured in an ad for Mango featuring Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne, and another that is featured in the trailer for the 2019 Netflix original series Baby. The band released a music video for the title track \"Dear Tommy\" on August 25, 2016.\n\nIn May 2017, Chromatics' former manager revealed on Twitter that Jewel had destroyed all copies of the finished \"Dear Tommy\" following a near-death experience in late 2015, but had subsequently re-recorded the entire album. As of August 2019, the album has not been released.\n\nThe band performed \"Shadow\" at the end of the two-hour-long season premiere of Showtime's \"Twin Peaks\" revival series, which aired on May 21, 2017.\n\nThe band released a deluxe version of the \"Cherry\" EP on July 31, 2017.\n\nOn October 1, 2019, the Italians Do It Better website was updated to show a new Chromatics album, albeit with the album and track names obscured. Upon the album's release in New Zealand, the album title was revealed to be \"Closer to Grey\", and the album title and track names were officially announced worldwide. The album was released on October 2, 2019. The band stated through their Instagram account that \"Closer to Grey\" did not contain any material from \"Dear Tommy\", and that the latter album would still be released, with no release date announced.\n\nOn January 24, 2020, Chromatics released a new single, \"TOY.\" On March 6, they released another single, \"Famous Monsters.\" On April 16 they released \"Teacher\" and a new tracklisting for Dear Tommy. \n\nChromatics have played at numerous music festivals around the world, such as the Paris Pitchfork Music Festival and Barcelona Primavera in 2012.

It is the home of Brown University's football and outdoor track teams. The athletic teams at Brown University, known as the Bears, compete in the Ivy League.\n\nBrown Stadium is located on Elmgrove Avenue in the city's East Side, approximately 3/4 of a mile from the rest of the athletic facilities and over a mile from the main campus. The architectural design features a trapezoid-shaped southwest stands and a smaller section of concrete bleachers on the northeast side. Stands sit on both sides of the field along with a running track. The press box traverses the entire top of the southwest stands, and the rear of the southwest side includes several ornate \"B\" logos and the university's seal, as well as two stone bear's heads on either end of the stands. \n\nThe stadium's current capacity is 20,000. The largest crowd ever recorded at the stadium was for the Brown vs. Colgate game on Thanksgiving morning 1932; portable bleachers were brought in to accommodate 33,000 fans.\n\nIn the early years of Brown sports, the football teams played at Adelaide Park in Elmwood or on the university campus. In 1897, Brown was given land just west of Hope Street about a mile and a half north of campus, on which it built Andrews Field. This combined football/baseball field and running track was used from 1899 to 1925.\n\nBrown Stadium, originally known as Brown University Field, constructed on the other side of Hope Street and slightly to the south, was financed entirely by subscription. The new field was dedicated on October 24, 1925, before a crowd of 27,000 spectators. The north stands are considerably smaller than the south ones, designed to allow for future expansion to mirror the large south ones and bring the stadium's fixed seating capacity to 32,000, but this expansion was never constructed. Adjacent to the field was Aldrich Baseball Field, and across Elmgrove Avenue was Marvel Gymnasium, completed in 1927.\n\nIn 1978 the stadium was completely renovated as part of the football team's 100th anniversary. The original wooden benches were replaced with aluminum. The concrete was restored and waterproofed, and the restrooms, press box, and graphics were painted. an underground sprinkler was installed. \n\nIn 1991 a new home team locker room and reception room were constructed.\n\nThe stadium's first night game was played on September 25, 2010, as Brown defeated Harvard, 29–14, before a crowd of 17,000 fans.\n\nBrown has had many successful teams since the stadium opened, including the Iron Man team of 1926, when eleven players played the entirety of two games and most of a third; the 1976, 1999, 2005, and 2008 Ivy League championship teams; as well as players such as Joe Paterno '50, former head football coach at Penn State, and several former NFL stars such as Don Colo of the Cleveland Browns and Steve Jordan of the Minnesota Vikings.\nThe stadium hosted the Division I NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship in 1976 and 1985 and two quarterfinal matches of the 2016 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship.\n\n\n"}

In fact, they form the basis of the so-called Bohemian school of chess composition, most fruitful in threemovers and moremovers. Model mates are very usual in helpmates and they appear often in selfmates too.\n\nThis example shows a problem by Miroslav Havel. The 1.

The main variations end with model mates from white batteries: \n\nThere are several other variations (after 1...Ne4 and 1...Ke6), which do not end with model mates, and allow for multiple continuations. In the Bohemian school they are irrelevant, as long as they end with a mate in a prescribed number of moves.\n\nThis example shows a helpmate, in which both sides cooperate to achieve a mate to the black king.

{"id": "2221830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221830", "title": "Progg", "text": "Progg\n\nProgg was a left-wing and anti-commercial musical movement in Sweden that began in the late 1960s and became more widespread in the 1970s. Not to be confused with the English expressions \"progressive music\" or \"prog rock,\" progg is a contraction of the Swedish word for musical progressivism, \"progressiv musik\". While there were progg bands playing progressive rock, the progg movement encompassed many different musical genres.\n\nThe political progg movement culminated around the 1975 Eurovision Song Contest, which was held in Stockholm after ABBAs victory in Brighton the year before. It was expressed that \"music can't be a contest\" and an \"alternative festival\" was held in protest. Due to this debate, Sweden did not participate in the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nThe progg movement was closely connected to similar movements in arts, theatre and design, as well as alternative lifestyles and left wing views. \nWhile being a political movement, some bands labelled as progg were nonetheless unaligned with any political agenda. The people playing and listening to this music came to be called \"proggare\" (literally \"proggers\") in Swedish.\nAlternative bands began to form in the late 1960s, but the movement emerged in full in the summer of 1970. A big alternative music festival was held at the field Gärdet in Stockholm between June 12 and June 14. The festival was illegal, as a permission for it had not been obtained . The new independent record company \"Silence\" released a compilation record with music from the festival as their first record, and signed some of the bands that played, including Träd, Gräs och Stenar and Gudibrallan. In 1971 MNW was formed. During this decade the progg movement had a strong position in the musical landscape of Sweden.\n\nAt the end of the 1970s, however, the movement started to decline, as many of the bands disintegrated and the \"music forums\" were closed. The left wing ideals became less dominating among young people, and the rock and folk music also became less popular than new genres such as hard rock and electronic music.\n\nMany musicians and people working with music in the end of the 1960s were against the commercialism of pop music. Notably, the record companies Silence and MNW were formed, and started to record and release this new music. They created a new distribution company, \"SAM-distribution\", which distributed the records of the alternative record companies, and so called \"music forums\", places where concerts could be held without a commercial middleman such as ordinary concert arrangers were created in many Swedish cities. In the middle of the 1970s around 75 music forums existed. The word that was generally used about the movement was \"musikrörelsen\", which means the music movement.\n\nProgg did not have a uniform sound and featured a broad spectrum of musical styles. There were a wide range of artists as well, including Bo Hansson, Kebnekajse, Södra bergens balalaikor, Blå Tåget, Hoola Bandoola Band, Nationalteatern, Dag Vag, and Jan Hammarlund.\nMost lyrics were in Swedish, while English was the common language for other pop and rock in Sweden at the time.\n\nThe two big progg record companies had a somewhat different musical profile.\n\nThe progg movement took a clear stance against capitalism and commercialism, but it was by no means a homogeneous movement. \nThe political opinions ranged from everything from anarchism and communism to less clearly pronounced general left-wing opinions. The relations with the governing Social Democratic Party were not that good, which can be exemplified by the song \"Fy på dig sosse\" (Shame on you, Social Democrat) by \"Gudibrallan\". Few people in the movement were members of any political party, though the communist parties the Swedish communist party and Communist Party of Sweden (1967) started their own record companies which joined the movement.\n\nThe United FNL groups were a strong movement in support of the National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam, and progg bands often played at their demonstrations. Progg bands also played at other big demonstrations at the time, such as the protest that managed to stop the cutting down of the elms in the park Kungsträdgården in Stockholm, and the protests to stop the tennis matches against tennis players from the Pinochet-ruled Chile in Båstad 1975.\n\nIn 1977 the record company Silence moved their studio to the small village Koppom in the forests of the province of Värmland.\n\nSome of the artists from the progg movement have continued to play music and managed to remain popular over the years, for example Björn Afzelius, Mikael Wiehe, Totta Näslund and Peps Persson.\n\nThere has been a stereotypical image of progg as something out of date and spaced out from the 1970s. On the other hand, since the end of the 1990s, many progg bands have experienced some renaissance, with many old progg bands reuniting for concerts and new records, for example Träd, Gräs och Stenar and Samla Mammas Manna. Some bands, like Nationalteatern, still go on long tours in the 21st century performing their old songs for a new generation. Silence has re-released much of their catalogue from the 1970s on CD, and old LPs with progg music are sold at high prices.\n\nThere are new musicians who have references to the progg music, and are sometimes called \"nyprogg\" (new progg), for example Dungen, Hovet, Cirkus Miramar and Doktor Kosmos.\n\nThe film \"Together\" from 2000 is set in Sweden during the progg era and features much progg music.\n\nThe Swedish comics artist David Nessle created the character Den Maskerade Proggaren (\"The Masked Progger\") as a pastiche on both the progg movement and Silver Age superhero comics.\n\n\n"}

He studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, Russia (where he was also known as Afanasy Slastyon), researched the Cossack documents in the archives of the Imperial Russian ministry of defense, and later worked as a teacher at the Arts and Crafts School (later renamed the State Ceramics Vocational School) in Myrhorod, Ukraine. A very gifted person, he perfected his talents in singing, bandura playing, ethnography, journalism, education, design, and architecture. Opanas Slastion was a true Ukrainian encyclopaedist.\n\nAt the time Slastion was growing up, there were opportunities for some Ukrainians to have their talents recognized in the Imperial capital and in Western Europe. Many gifted Ukrainian performers joined court choirs and theatre, opera, and ballet troupes, and the Ukrainian artists were attracted to the Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg. In the 19th century among these Ukrainian artists was the famous poet and writer Taras Shevchenko, whose writings, etchings and paintings dedicated to Ukrainian ethnographic themes (genre scenes and portraits) greatly influenced Slastion, who became the first illustrator of Shevchenko's 'Kobzar' (the illustrations to \"Haidamaky\"). As a painter, Slastion is credited with depicting series of Cossack and kobzar portraits and scenes of Ukrainian country life.\n\nSlastion was one of the most active propagators of the artistry of the kobzars. Actually, he himself was the first outstanding sighted bandura player and tutor of modern times. \"Kobzar\" Ivan Kuchuhura Kucherenko stayed with him in Myrhorod in order to refine his performance of \"dumy\" (sung epic poems) under the guidance of Slastion. Danylo Pika, one of the founders of the Poltava Bandurist Capella (who became its conductor), initially learned to play the bandura from Slastion in Myrhorod. Later in his life, in the early 1930s, Slastion designed the shape of the standard Kiev bandura (the familiar modern shape of the instrument). Some other instruments of the bandura family (such as those made by Ivan Skliar, for example) were also modeled on Slastion's designs.\n\nSlastion was also a leading Ukrainian folklorist and ethnographer. In 1875, then a student at the Petersburg Academy of Arts and a budding folklorist, he spent his holidays in Ukraine and got the chance to know the artistry of the \"kobzar\" Nekhovaizub.\n\nIn 1876 P. Martynovych and his colleague Slastion travelled to Lokhvytsia and recorded the \"duma\" parody by kobzar Ivan Kravchenko. In 1887 Slastion made an engraving of kobzar P. Siroshtan.\nIn 1905 he painted a portrait of kobzar Pavlo Hashchenko and noted that Hashchenko knew four \"dumy\".\n\nIn 1902-1903 he was one of the initiators of the idea of the preservation of kobzar music by means of sound recording using recently invented phonograph.\n\nIn 1906 Slastion met the \"kobzar\" Zhovniansky, recorded his performances of \"dumy\", and painted his portrait.\n\nIn 1908 in Yalta the technically savvy Slastion helped Lesia Ukrainka and her husband Klyment Kvitka make live recordings (on phonograph cylinders) of the \"dumy\" performed by the blind virtuoso Hnat Honcharenko (circa 1837 - circa 1917), as part of the major project of the preservation of kobzar music. These recordings were transcribed by Filaret Kolessa, who later published them in his collection \"Melodiyi ukrayins'kykh narodnykh dum\" (The Melodies of the Ukrainian Folk Dumas). It is known that Slastion corresponded with another well-known blind \"kobzar\", Tereshko Parkhomenko (1872–1910). In 1909 Slastion made recordings of the repertoire of \"kobzar\" Hovtan, including the \"duma\" \"The Widow and Her Three Sons\".\n\nSelections from Slastion's repertoire originally recorded on wax cylinders can be found on a record released as a dedication to Lesia Ukrainka.\n\nAs an architect, Opanas Slastion was one of the founding fathers of the \"Ukrainian Modern\" style in architecture.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2221848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221848", "title": "Zothique", "text": "Zothique\n\nZothique is an imagined future continent in a series of short stories by Clark Ashton Smith. Zothique is also the title of the cycle of tales which take place there. In terms of number and extent, the \"Zothique cycle\" is the largest collection of stories written by Smith. The cycle belongs to the fantasy genre, and more precisely to the Dying Earth subgenre.\n\nClark Ashton Smith himself described the \"Zothique cycle\" in a letter to L. Sprague de Camp, dated November 3, 1953:\nZothique, vaguely suggested by Theosophic theories about past and future continents, is the last inhabited continent of earth. The continents of our present cycle have sunken, perhaps several times. Some have remained submerged; others have re-risen, partially, and re-arranged themselves. Zothique, as I conceive it, comprises Asia Minor, Arabia, Persia, India, parts of northern and eastern Africa, and much of the Indonesian archipelago. A new Australia exists somewhere to the south. To the west, there are only a few known islands, such as Naat, in which the black cannibals survive. To the north, are immense unexplored deserts; to the east, an immense unvoyaged sea. The peoples are mainly of Aryan or Semitic descent; but there is a negro kingdom (Ilcar) in the north-west; and scattered blacks are found throughout the other countries, mainly in palace-harems. In the southern islands survive vestiges of Indonesian or Malayan races. The science and machinery of our present civilization have long been forgotten, together with our present religions. But many gods are worshipped; and sorcery and demonism prevail again as in ancient days. Oars and sails alone are used by mariners. There are no fire-arms—only the bows, arrows, swords, javelins, etc. of antiquity. The chief language spoken (of which I have provided examples in an unpublished drama) is based on Indo-European roots and is highly inflected, like Sanskrit, Greek and Latin. \nDarrell Schweitzer suggests the idea of writing about a far future land may have come from William Hope Hodgson's novel \"The Night Land\", noting that Smith was an admirer of Hodgson's work. However, this theory was conclusively disproven by Scott Conner's \"Dust and Atoms: The Influence of William Hope Hodgson on Clark Ashton Smith\" in \"Sargasso\" #2 (2016), the scholarly journal devoted to Hodgson.\n\nThe \"Zothique Cycle\" consists of sixteen completed short stories, a one-act play, and assorted incomplete story-fragments and story-sketches. The Tales of Zothique was also referenced in other mythos stories such as Derleth's Dwellers in Darkness and in Ramsey Campbell's The Tomb-Herd (an early version of The Church in High Street {published in Crypt of Cthulhu#43} ).\n\nIn chronological order of writing, the short stories are:\n\n\nThe publication date does not always follow the date of composition; some stories were rejected, but accepted at a later date; others were simply held for publication for a protracted period of time.\n\nBelonging to the period following the publication of \"Morthylla\" is a one-act play set in Zothique, \"The Dead Will Cuckold You\" (\"DC\"). It was not published during Smith's lifetime, but appeared in \"In Memoriam: Clark Ashton Smith, the Anthem Series\" in 1963.\n\nIn addition to these, two fragments of unfinished Zothique stories, each amounting only to a couple of pages, survive: \"Shapes of Adamant\" (\"SA\") and \"Mandor's Enemy\" (\"ME\"). A never-written Zothique story, \"The Feet of Sidaiva\" (\"FS\"), exists as a one-sentence plot sketch. A planned Zothique novel, \"The Scarlet Succubus\", only exists as a title.\n\nSeveral maps of Zothique have been drawn; all, however, include a fair amount of imagination on the part of their artists, which are either not derived from the Zothique stories or are actually inconsistent with them. Among the more common cartographical errors are:\n\nAccording to Smith's stories, the future continent of Zothique is bounded by sea to the west, south, and east; its northern boundaries are dubious.\n\nWest of Zothique lies the island of \"Iribos\" (MC), and, at a great distance, the necromantic isle of \"Naat\" (NN). Beyond Naat an oceanic current, called the Black River, is said to sweep all travelers to their doom beyond the world's edge (DE, NN, MC). Many notable necromancers and sorcerers come from Naat, including Mmatmuor and Sodosma, sometime rulers of Cincor (EN); Narghai and Vemba-Tsith, the assistants of Abnon-Tha (CG); Sarcand, the rival of Mior Lumivix (MC); and the necromantic household of Vacharn, Vokal, and Uldulla (NN).\n\nSouth of Zothique is the Indaskian Sea, in which are found the islands of \"Cyntrom\" and \"Uccastrog,\" the latter also known as the \"Isle of the Torturers.\" Uccastrog's king, Ildrac and the other inhabitants of the isle were known for their brutality and sadism against arriving travelers. They were wiped out by the \"Silver Death\" plague brought by Fulbra. (IT)\n\nEast of Zothique lies the island kingdom of \"Sotar\", whose capital is Loithé (VE, GA). Beyond it are the island of \"Tosk\" and the atolls of \"Yumatot\"; after that are the scattered islands of the Ilozian Sea, mostly unnamed, save for \"Ornava\", the island of birds. (VE)\n\nThe northernmost known realms of Zothique are \"Ilcar\" (BA) and \"Dooza Thom\" (WU, SA), whose royal seat is Avandas. North of Dooza Thom is only the desert of Nooth-Kemmor. Better known than these are four great realms that repeatedly appear in the stories: the empire of Xylac, and the kingdoms of Tasuun, Yoros, and Ustaim.\n\n\"Xylac\" is a major state of northwestern Zothique, governed by an emperor. Its principal city is Ummaos. It has a western seacoast which includes the port cities of Mirouane (MC) and of Oroth, from which one can sail to Yoros. (NN) Land routes lead southward from Ummaos through the Celotian Waste and past the city of Zul-Bha-Sair to the kingdom of Tasuun. (CG, DE)\n\n\"Zul-Bha-Sair\" is a city-state on the south-west of the red sands of the Celotian Waste, between Xylac and Tasuun. It is best known for its ancient temple of Mordiggian, god of the dead, to whom \"it is the law and the custom\" that all who die be given to his priests and offered to the deity as food. (CG)\n\n\"Tasuun\", \"famous for the number and antiquity of its mummies,\" lies due south of Xylac. Its chief city is Miraab. Ninety miles north of Miraab lies the centuries-abandoned capital of Chaon Gacca, site of the ancient palace of the Kings of Tasuun. Some legends about its abandonment refer to Shadows that menaced King Agmeni, driving him insane or causing his hand to rot. The mummy of Avaina is buried there with a magic mirror. (WV, WU) \n\n\"Yoros\", known for its wines, lies to the south, facing the Indaskian Sea. Its chief city is Faraad (also spelled Pharaad), situated on the river Voum, which flows south into the sea. Also in Yoros are the cities Silpon and Siloar (IT), the river Vos and the demon-haunted wasteland of Izdrel (BA).\n\n\"Tinarath\" lies 'far to the east' of Xylac (DE) and immediately north of Cincor (EN). It is a \"gray country\", whose people abhorred necromancy.\n\n\"Ustaim\" is a kingdom on the eastern shores of Zothique, east of Xylac, looking toward the island of Sotar. Its chief city is Aramoam (VE). From it one can travel to the dead kingdom of Calyz (X), or by a roundabout way to Tasuun (TS).\n\nIn Zothique, where the dead vastly outnumber the living, many kingdoms have risen and fallen. The abandoned cities of these lost kingdoms can still be found by the unwary traveler.\n\nOne of the most ancient of these was the \"kingdom of Ossaru\", who ruled half of Zothique. His capital lay in a desolate region near the northeastern borders of Yoros. (TS)\n\n\"Cincor\" was the home of the fabled Nimboth dynasty, and its capital of Yethlyreom. It once suffered a plague. It is now a \"drear and leprous and ashen\" desert (EN). The situation of Cincor relative to the other kingdoms of Zothique is uncertain, but it apparently lies east or southeast of Xylac. It was thought by some that Ossaru's capital might be located there. North of Cincor lies the land of Tinarath. The eastern bounds of Cincor are the Mykrasian Mountains, beyond which the way leads through fruitful Zhel, many-citied Istanam, and the desert of Dhir, until one comes at last to Calyz. (X)\n\n\"Calyz\" was an ancient kingdom on the eastern shores of Zothique, within traveling distance of Ustaim. For a thousand years, its chief city had been Shathair. Long abandoned, Calyz enjoyed a brief but evanescent return to glory when the long-dead King Amero, son of King Eldamaque, entirely possessed the body and mind of the young goatherd Xeethra and, through him, reclaimed his former rule. (X)\n\nThe historical sequence of events in Zothique cannot be securely determined, not only because the stories cover events only sketchily, but also because in Zothique history is non-directional. Kingdoms rise and fall, and are rebuilt, in a seemingly endless cycle; and whether a particular event took place before or after one of the catastrophes that punctuate the cycle is often a matter of conjecture.\n\nThe oldest of the kingdoms of which myth tells is that of Ossaru, the wizard-king who, together with the extraterrestrial monster Nioth Korghai, ruled half Zothique. The very name of this land is forgotten, and its capital is lost in a wilderness peopled by the cannibal Ghorii. (TS)\n\nAfter Ossaru rose the Empire of Cincor, which lasted for two thousand years, from its first emperor, Hestaiyon, to Illeiro, the last of the Nimboth dynasty ruling in Yethlyreom. Illeiro and all his people perished in a plague, and Cincor remained blighted and deserted for two hundred years after that, until Mmatmuor and Sodosma, necromancers of Naat, revived its people to an undead half-life. This empire of the dead, with which the necromancers planned to conquer the northern land of Tinarath, lasted only a brief time before the dead, led by the first and last of their ancient rulers, overthrew the sorcerers and brought themselves to oblivion. (EN)\n\nAfter Ossaru, and perhaps overlapping with the Nimboth dynasty, the kingdom of Tasuun was founded by King Tnepreez in Chaon Gacca. His successors included Queen Avaina, and the Kings Acharnil and Agmeni. (WV) The disasters that befell the latter prompted the movement of the capital of Tasuun to the city of Miraab, where Mandis and Archain reigned, the latter dying at the hands of his wife Xantlicha (DI). The fifty-ninth king of Tasuun, Famorgh, surpassed all the others in luxury, and his wife Lunalia (of Xylac) and his daughter Ulua were known for their experiments in sorcery. It was during his reign that the city of Miraab was destroyed by an earthquake; nonetheless, his son Mandor ruled after him. (WU, ME)\n\nThe Empire of Xylac was contemporary with Tasuun. Of its emperors, the names of Caleppos (CG), Pithaim, and Zotulla are remembered. The last, known for his pomp and cruelty, suffered at the hands of the sorcerer Namirrha, who had borne him a grudge since childhood. Namirrha's vengeance brought about the utter destruction of Ummaos, chief city of Xylac (DE); but a later Ummaos was built on the ruins, where the astrologer Nushain dwelt in after days (LH).\n\nThe Kingdom of Yoros was ruled under many kings of uncertain date, of whom Smaragad, son of Famostan (DC) and Hoaraph (BA) are known. The last king of Yoros was Fulbra, son of Altath, in whose time at least two lands—first Tasuun, then Yoros—were devastated by the Silver Death, a plague that killed its victims instantly and left them with a frosted appearance. Fulbra survived by magic, but only long enough to transmit the plague to the torturers' isle of Uccastrog (IT).\n\nZothique is a polytheistic society, where many gods and goddesses are worshipped. Some of this worship is open, with temples and priesthoods; other deities or even demons are worshipped secretly, service to them being either forbidden or at least not spoken of. Some deities are known throughout Zothique; others have their worship confined to a small area or even a single city.\n\n\"Vergama\", or \"Destiny\", is an ancient deity whose attributes are much disputed, though he is often believed to be almost omnipotent, ruling both the heavens and the earth. Vergama has no temples, idols, or altars, but is sometimes invoked in prayer, especially by sorcerers. When seen, he appears as a colossal \"cowled and muffled figure\" seated on a marble chair. The hieroglyphic writing in his book preserves the forms of all things that have ever been. (BV, LH)\n\nThe \"Moon-God\" has a temple in Faraad, capital of Yoros, formerly known for its wealth—especially in books of magic --- before it was plundered by the pirate Omvor. (MC)\n\n\"Ililot\" is a goddess of love known across Zothique. On the western coasts she is a gentle goddess, \"caring alone for love and lovers' joy\"; she is depicted with a moon between her eyebrows. But in Yoros she is \"a darker goddess\", whose worship has a tinge of blood. (DC)\n\n\"Basatan\" is a deity of the sea, who exerts power over the winds, the sea-currents, and the creatures of the deep. His signet-ring, shaped like a Kraken grasping a gem in its tentacles, was a powerful magic talisman that allowed its possessor a share in Basatan's powers. (MC)\n\n\"Ojhal\" is a virgin goddess, originally worshipped in Ilcar. Ojhal's priests formed an order of celibate monks. When the worship of Ojhal was banned by Ilcar's emperor, a group of monks fled south to Yoros, and founded a new monastery in the wastelands of Izdrel. (BA)\n\n\"Yuckla\", \"the small and grotesque god of laughter\", is deemed to exert a beneficent and somewhat protective influence. His shrines, unattended, could be found by the roadside in Tasuun. Worshippers sometimes sought his favor by pouring a libation of wine upon his altar. (WV)\n\n\"Yululun\" is a deity whose office is to protect the sanctity of tombs. (WV)\n\n\"Geol\" is a \"terrestrial god\", worshipped in the realm of Ustaim. He is the chief deity of the capital city of Aramoam, where his temple is. Geol is depicted in the form of a pot-bellied man reclining on his back. Worshippers in the Temple of Geol can sometimes hear the audible prophecies of the god emanating from the navel of the idol. These oracles are deemed to be infallible. (VE)\n\n\"Mordiggian\", the Charnel God, is worshipped nowhere but in the city of Zul-Bha-Sair, where his low, windowless temple is found in the city center. All those who die within the city are his rightful property, and are delivered to his temple in the care of his semi-bestial priests, where, it is said, the god devours them. These priests are always clad in purple gowns, their faces hidden by silver masks in the shape of skulls. Other than the private rituals of the priests, no other rites in honor of Mordiggian are practised. (CG)\n\nOf the less licit deities and demons known in Zothique, \"Thasaidon\" \"black god of evil\", \"the archfiend\", \"lord of the seven hells beneath the earth\" is the chief. He is depicted in the form of a warrior in full armor, wielding a spiky mace; he is also said to have \"dark horns\" and to sit on a \"throne of ever-burning brass\". Thasaidon gives help and power to those necromancers who put themselves at his service. He gave aid to the ancient king Ossaru who dominated half Zothique (TS); he aided the sorcerer Namirrha in his projects, until he projected the destruction of Xylac,(DE); he lent his power to Xeethra, in whom the spirit of the long-dead King Amero was revived, and allowed him to restore the kingdom of Calyz, for a time, to its former glory. (X)\n\n\"Thamogorgos\", \"lord of the abyss\", is a devil to whom the wizard Namirrha turned to destroy Ummaos, chief city of Xylac. His 'macrocosmic' horses were so gigantic that their hooves could flatten the city. (DE)\n\n\"Alila\", \"queen of perdition and goddess of all iniquities,\" was worshipped with obscene rites by some in Tasuun. (WU)\n\nOther, nameless deities include the god represented as a clay image in the palace of the Nimboth dynasty in Yethlyreom (EN); the goddess represented by an ebony figurehead on the royal barge of the kings of Yoros; the demonic god represented by a brazen image in the palace of the kings of Uccastrog (IT); the \"dim, fatal deity\" of the nomads of Zyra (NN); the 'fabulous goddesses' depicted on the tapestries of the royal palace in Tasuun (WU); and the gods to whom temples were built in Xylac (DE) and Calyz (X).\n\nAugust Derleth in The Dweller in Darkness mentions Zothique, and thus tries to tie this far future continent to the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2221852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221852", "title": "Chytridiomycosis", "text": "Chytridiomycosis\n\nChytridiomycosis is an infectious disease in amphibians, caused by the chytrid fungi \"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis\" and \"Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans\", a nonhyphal zoosporic fungus. Chytridiomycosis has been linked to dramatic population declines or even extinctions of amphibian species in western North America, Central America, South America, eastern Australia, East Africa (Tanzania), and Dominica and Montserrat in the Caribbean. Much of the New World is also at risk of the disease arriving within the coming years. \nThe fungus is capable of causing sporadic deaths in some amphibian populations and 100% mortality in others. No effective measure is known for control of the disease in wild populations. Various clinical signs are seen by individuals affected by the disease. A number of options are possible for controlling this disease-causing fungus, though none has proved to be feasible on a large scale. The disease has been proposed as a contributing factor to a global decline in amphibian populations that apparently has affected about 30% of the amphibian species of the world. However, recent research has shown that current evidence linking chytrid fungi and chytridiomycosis to global amphibian declines is minimal.\n\nWhether chytridiomycosis is a new, emergent pathogen or a pathogen with recently increased virulence is unclear.\n\nThe disease in its epizootic form was first discovered in 1993 in dead and dying frogs in Queensland, Australia. It had been present in the country since at least 1978 and is widespread across Australia. It is also found in Africa, the Americas, Europe, New Zealand, and Oceania. In Australia, Panama, and New Zealand, the fungus seemed to have suddenly 'appeared' and expanded its range at the same time frog numbers declined. In the Americas, it originated in Venezuela in 1987, where it swept up the continent into Central America. It was also found in the lower part of Central America in 1987, where it spread down to meet the upward sweep from South America. However, it may simply be that the fungus occurs naturally and was only identified recently because it has become more virulent or more prevalent in the environment, or because host populations have become less resistant to the disease. The fungus has been detected in four areas of Australia—the east coast, Adelaide, south-west Western Australia and the Kimberley—and is probably present elsewhere.\n\nAmong frogs, the oldest documented occurrence of \"Batrachochytrium\" is from a specimen of a Titicaca water frog collected in 1863, and among salamaders the oldest was a Japanese giant salamander collected in 1902. However, both these involved strains of the fungus that have not been implicated in mass-mortality events. A later instance of a Bd-infected amphibian was a specimen of an African clawed frog (\"Xenopus laevis\") collected in 1938, and this species also appears to be essentially unaffected by the disease, making it a suitable vector. The first well-documented method of human pregnancy testing involved this species, and as a result, large-scale international trade in living African clawed frogs began more than 60 years ago. If \"Batrachochytrium\" originated in Africa, the African clawed frog is thought to have been the vector of the initial spread out of the continent. The earliest documented case of the disease chytridiomycosis was an American bullfrog (\"Rana catesbeiana\") collected in 1978.\n\nThe geographic range of chytridiomycosis is difficult to ascertain. If it occurs, the disease is only present where the fungus \"B. dendrobatidis\" is present. However, the disease is not always present where the fungus is. Reasons for amphibian declines are often termed ‘enigmatic’ because the cause is unknown. Why some areas are affected by the fungus while others are not is not fully understood. Oscillating factors such as climate, habitat suitability, and population density may be factors which cause the fungus to infect amphibians of a given area. Therefore, when considering the geographic range of chytridiomycosis, the range of \"B. dendrobatidis\" occurrence must be considered.\nThe geographic range of \"B. dendrobatidis\" has recently been mapped, and spans much of the world. \"B. dendrobatidis\" has been detected in 56 of 82 countries, and in 516 of 1240 (42%) species using a data set of more than 36,000 individuals. It is widely distributed in the Americas, and detected sporadically in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Asia, for example, has only 2.35% prevalence.\n\nThe range suitable for \"B. dendrobatidis\" in the New World is vast. Regions with its highest suitability include habitats that contain the world's most diverse amphibian fauna. Areas at risk are the Sierra Madre Pine Oak Occidental Forest, the Sonoran and Sinaloan dry forest, the Veracruz moist forest, Central America east from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Caribbean Islands, the temperate forest in Chile and western Argentina south of 30°S, the Andes above 1000 m above sea level in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador, eastern slopes of the Andes in Peru and Bolivia, the Brazilian Atlantic forest, Uruguay, Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina, as well as the southwestern and Madeira–Tapajós Amazonian rainforests.\nCurrently, the effects of chytridiomycosis are seen most readily in Central America, eastern Australia, South America, and western North America.\n\nA study suggests that changing global temperatures may be responsible for increased proliferation of chytridiomycosis. The rise in temperature has increased evaporation in certain forest environments that as a result has promoted cloud formation. Experts propose that increased cloud cover might actually be decreasing the daytime temperature by blocking the sun, while at night the cloud cover serves as insulation to raise the nighttime temperature from its normal range. The combination of decreased daytime temperature and increased nighttime temperatures may be providing optimal growth and reproduction for Chytrid fungus which has preferred temperature range between 63° and 77 °F (17° and 25 °C). The fungus dies at temperatures at and above 30 °C, which without the cloud cover from increased evaporation is more easily reached by the environment and can, therefore, more easily keep the fungus population in check.\n\nChytridiomycosis caused by the fungus \"B. dendrobatidis\" predominantly affects the outermost layers of skin containing keratin. When most species reach a \"B. dendrobatidis\" threshold of 10,000 zoospores, they are not able to breathe, hydrate, osmoregulate, or thermoregulate correctly. This is proven by blood samples that show a lack of certain electrolytes, such as sodium, magnesium, and potassium. \"B. dendrobatidis\" is currently known to have two life stages. The first is the asexual zoosporangial stage. When a host first contracts the disease, spores penetrate the skin and attach themselves using microtubule roots. The second stage takes place when the initial asexual zoosporangia produce motile zoospores. To disperse and infect epidermal cells, a wet surface is needed.\nA second species of \"Batrachochytrium\", \"B. salamandrivorans\", was discovered in 2013 and is known to cause chytridiomycosis in salamanders.\n\n\"B. dendrobatidis\", a waterborne pathogen, disperses zoospores into the environment. The zoospores use flagella for locomotion through water systems until they reach a new host and enter cutaneously. The \"B. dendrobatidis\"’ lifecycle continues until new zoospores are produced from the zoosporangium and exit to the environment or reinfect the same host. Once the host is infected with \"B. dendrobatidis\", it can potentially develop chytridiomycosis, but not all infected hosts develop it. Other forms of transmission are currently unknown; however, chytridiomycosis is postulated to be transmitted through direct contact of hosts or through an intermediate host.\n\nMuch of how \"B. dendrobatidis\" is successfully transmitted from one host to the next is largely unknown. Once released into the aquatic environment, zoospores travel less than 2 cm within 24 hours before they encyst. The limited range of \"B. dendrobatidis\" zoospores suggest some unknown mechanism exists by which they transmit from one host to the next, which can involve the pet trade, and especially the American Bullfrog. Abiotic factors such as temperature, pH level, and nutrient levels affect the success of \"B. dendrobatidis\" zoospores. The fungus zoospores can survive within a temperature range of 4–25 °C and a pH range of 6–7.\n\nChytridiomycosis is believed to follow this course: zoospores first encounter amphibian skin and quickly give rise to sporangia, which produce new zoospores. The disease then progresses as these new zoospores reinfect the host. Morphological changes in amphibians infected with the fungus include a reddening of the ventral skin, convulsions with extension of hind limbs, accumulations of sloughed skin over the body, sloughing of the superficial epidermis of the feet and other areas, slight roughening of the surface with minute skin tags, and occasional small ulcers or hemorrhage. Behavioral changes can include lethargy, a failure to seek shelter, a failure to flee, a loss of righting reflex, and abnormal posture (e.g. sitting with the hind legs away from the body).\n\nAmphibians infected with \"B. dendrobatidis\" have been known to show many different clinical signs. Perhaps the earliest sign of infection is anorexia, occurring as quickly as eight days after being exposed. Individuals infected are also commonly found in a lethargic state, characterized by slow movements, and refuse to move when stimulated. Excessive shedding of skin is seen in most frog species affected by \"B. dendrobatidis\". These pieces of shed skin are described as opaque, gray-white, and tan. Some of these patches of skin are also found adhered to the skin of the amphibians. These signs of infection are often seen 12–15 days following exposure. The most typical symptom of chytridiomycosis is thickening of skin, which promptly leads to the death of the infected individuals because those individuals cannot take in the proper nutrients, release toxins, or, in some cases, breathe. Other common signs are reddening of the skin, convulsions, and a loss of righting reflex . In tadpoles, \"B. dendrobatidis\" affects the mouthparts, where keratin is present, leading to abnormal feeding behaviors or discoloration of the mouth.\n\nThe amphibian chytrid fungus appears to grow best between 17 and 25 °C, and exposure of infected frogs to high temperatures can cure the frogs. In nature, the more time individual frogs were found at temperatures above 25 °C, the less likely they were to be infected by the amphibian chytrid. This may explain why chytridiomycosis-induced amphibian declines have occurred primarily at higher elevations and during cooler months. Naturally produced cutaneous peptides can inhibit the growth of \"B. dendrobatidis\" when the infected amphibians are around temperatures near 10 °C (50 °F), allowing species like the northern leopard frog (\"Rana pipiens\") to clear the infection in about 15% of cases.\n\nAlthough many declines have been credited to the fungus \"B. dendrobatidis\" - although likely prematurely so in many cases - some species resist the infection and some populations can survive with a low level of persistence of the disease. In addition, some species that seem to resist the infection may actually harbor a nonpathogenic form of \"B. dendrobatidis\".\n\nSome researchers contend the focus on chytridiomycosis has made amphibian conservation efforts dangerously myopic. A review of the data in the IUCN Red List found the threat of the disease was assumed in most cases, but no evidence shows, in fact, it is a threat. Conservation efforts in New Zealand continue to be focused on curing the critically endangered native Archey's frog, \"Leiopelma archeyi\", of chytridiomycosis, though research has shown clearly that they are immune from infection by \"B. dendrobatidis\" and are dying in the wild of other still-to-be identified diseases. In Guatemala, several thousand tadpoles perished from an unidentified pathogen distinct from \"B. dendrobatidis\". \n\nA 2019 \"Science\" review assessed that chytridiomycosis was a factor in the decline of at least 501 amphibian species during the past 50 years, of which 90 species were confirmed or presumed to have gone extinct in the wild and another 124 had declined in numbers by more than 90%. The review characterized the overall toll as the \"greatest recorded loss of biodiversity attributable to a disease\". However, a follow-up study in \"Science\" found the 2019 study by Scheele et al. to be lacking in the necessary evidence to make these claims and found the conclusions could not be reproduced with the original study's data and methods. It remains unclear how many and which species have been impacted by chytridiomycosis, but there are good data for a limited number of species such as the mountain yellow-legged frog in the Sierra Nevada mountains.\n\nDue to the fungus' immense impact on amphibian populations, considerable research has been undertaken to devise methods to combat its proliferation in the wild. Among the most promising is the revelation that amphibians in colonies that survive the passage of the chytrid epidemic tend to carry higher levels of the bacterium \"Janthinobacterium lividum\". This bacterium produces antifungal compounds, such as indole-3-carboxaldehyde and violacein, that inhibit the growth of \"B. dendrobatidis\" even at low concentrations. Similarly, the bacterium \"Lysobacter gummosus\" found on the red-backed salamander (\"Plethodon cinereus\"), produces the compound 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol that is inhibitory to the growth of \"B. dendrobatidis\".\n\nUnderstanding the interactions of microbial communities present on amphibians' skin with fungal species in the environment can reveal why certain amphibians, such as the frog \"Rana muscosa\", are susceptible to the fatal effects of \"B. dendrobatidis\" and why others, such as the salamander \"Hemidactylium scutatum\", are able to coexist with the fungus. As mentioned before, the antifungal bacterial species \"Janthinobacterium lividum\", found on several amphibian species, has been shown to prevent the effects of the pathogen even when added to another amphibian that lacks the bacteria (\"B. dendrobatidis\"-susceptible amphibian species). Interactions between cutaneous microbiota and \"B. dendrobatidis\" can be altered to favor the resistance of the disease, as seen in past studies concerning the addition of the violacein-producing bacteria \"J. lividum\" to amphibians that lacked sufficient violacein, allowing them to inhibit infection. Although the exact concentration of violacein (antifungal metabolite produced by \"J. lividum\") needed to inhibit the effects of \"B. dendrobatidis\" is not fully confirmed, violacein concentration can determine whether or not an amphibian will experience morbidity (or mortality) caused by \"B. dendrobatidis\". The frog \"Rana muscosa\", for example, has been found to have very low concentrations of violacein on its skin, yet the concentration is so small, it is unable to facilitate increased survivability of the frog; furthermore, \"J. lividum\" has not been found to be present on the skin of \"R. muscosa\". This implies that the antifungal bacterium \"J. lividum\" (native to other amphibians' skin, such as \"Hemidactylium scutatum\") is able to produce a sufficient amount of violacein to prevent infection by \"B. dendrobatidis\" and allow coexistence with the potentially deadly fungus.\n\nOne study has postulated that the water flea \"Daphnia magna\" eats the spores of the fungus.\n\nThe hypothesis that pesticide use has contributed to declining amphibian populations has been suggested several times in the literature. Interactions between pesticides and chytridiomycosis were examined in 2007, and sublethal exposure to the pesticide carbaryl (a cholinesterase inhibitor) was shown to increase susceptibility of foothill yellow-legged frogs (\"Rana boylii\") to chytridiomycosis. In particular, the skin peptide defenses were significantly reduced after exposure to carbaryl, suggesting pesticides may inhibit this innate immune defence, and increase susceptibility to disease.\n\nHints of emerging evolutionary resistance in a rebounding population of an afflicted frog species were reported from ecological study of an epizootically endangered stream-breeding frog \"Mixophyes fleayi\" reported from subtropical Australia. Rebound of frog species in Panama after decline are not associated with pathogen attenuation, but rather a host factor - whether an evolved genetic resistance to the fungus infection, or an otherwise acquired trait (such as a hypothetically protective microbial colonization) is yet to be identified.\n\nThe use of antifungals and heat-induced therapy has been suggested as a treatment of \"B. dendrobatidis.\"However, some of these antifungals may cause adverse skin effects on certain species of frogs, and although they are used to treat species that are infected by chytridiomycosis, the infection is never fully eradicated. A study done by Rollins-Smith and colleagues suggests that itraconazole is the antifungal of choice when it comes to treatment of Bd.\nThis is favored in comparison to amphotericin B and chloramphenicol because of their toxicity, specifically chloramphenicol as it is correlated with leukemia in toads. This becomes a difficult situation because without treatment, frogs will suffer from limb deformities and even death, but may also suffer skin abnormalities with treatment. \"Treatment is not always 100% successful and not all amphibians tolerate treatment very well, therefore chytridiomycosis should always be treated with the advice of a veterinarian.\"\n\nIndividuals infected with \"B. dendrobatidis\" are bathed in intraconazole solutions, and within a few weeks, previously infected individuals test negative for \"B. dendrobatidis\" using PCR assays. Heat therapy is also used to neutralize \"B. dendrobatidis\" in infected individuals. Temperature-controlled laboratory experiments are used to increase the temperature of an individual past the optimal temperature range of \"B. dendrobatidis\". Experiments, where the temperature is increased beyond the upper bound of the \"B. dendrobatidis\" optimal range of 25 to 30 °C, show its presence will dissipate within a few weeks and individuals infected return to normal. Formalin/malachite green has also been used to successfully treat individuals infected with chytridiomycosis. An Archey's frog was successfully cured of chytridiomycosis by applying chloramphenicol topically. However, the potential risks of using antifungal drugs on individuals are high.\n\n\n"}

Theodosius passed\nthe rule of the Western Empire to his younger son Honorius in the following year (with general Stilicho as regent while Honorius was underage).\n\nIn 313 Constantine I and Licinius I had legalized the Christian faith with the Edict of Milan. Theodosius I had made it the official religion of the State with the 380 Edict of Thessalonica. Conflict simmered between the Roman Senate, many of whom were not Christian, and the emperors in Constantinople and Milan who officially subscribed to Christian teachings. The senators wrote letters and argued for a return to traditional Roman beliefs, often stressing the protection and good fortune the old Roman gods had bestowed upon Rome since her beginnings as a small city-state. For their part, the Christian emperors emphasized the primacy of Christianity, although not all did so to the same extent. This clash between the Roman world's two main religions was for the most part an academic debate, without threats of armed uprisings, although small-scale violence was widespread.\n\nHowever, on 15 May 392, the Western Emperor Valentinian II was found dead at his residence in Vienne, Gaul. Valentinian had continued the imperial policy of suppressing the interests of adherents of the old pagan religions while supporting Christians. This policy had resulted in increasing tensions between the emperor and the senators. Arbogast was the \"magister militum\", or military commander, of the Western Empire and its \"de facto\" ruler. After Valentinian's death he informed Theodosius, the Eastern Emperor that the young emperor had committed suicide.\n\nTensions between the two halves of the empire were heightened further that summer. Arbogast made several attempts to contact Theodosius, but apparently none got further than the ears of the Eastern praetorian prefect, or chief minister, Rufinus. The responses that Arbogast received from Rufinus were unhelpful. Theodosius himself was slowly coming to the belief that Valentinian had been murdered, in no small part because his wife Galla was convinced her brother's death was caused by treachery. For his part, Arbogast had few friends in the Eastern court, although his uncle Richomeres was chief commander of the eastern cavalry. As it appeared increasingly likely that whatever course Theodosius decided upon would be hostile towards Arbogast, the Frank decided to make the first move.\n\nOn 22 August Arbogast elevated Flavius Eugenius, the Western imperial court's \"magister scrinii\", or senior civil servant, to the throne of the Western Empire. Eugenius was a well-respected scholar of rhetoric, and a native Roman, making him a far more acceptable candidate for the purple than the Frankish commander. His ascension was backed by the praetorian prefect of Italy, Nicomachus Flavianus the Elder, and by many of the pagan members of the Roman Senate. Some senators, notably Symmachus, were uneasy with this action. After his elevation to emperor, Eugenius appointed several important pagan senators to key positions in the Western government. He also supported a movement to advance the traditional religion by granting it official recognition and by restoring important shrines such as the Altar of Victory and the Temple of Venus and Rome. These actions earned Eugenius withering criticism from Bishop Ambrose of Milan and did little to endear him to the Christian Theodosius.\n\nAs a Christian, Theodosius was distressed by the apparent pagan revival that was occurring under Eugenius's reign. In addition there was the issue of Valentinian's death, which had never been resolved to his satisfaction. Furthermore, Eugenius had removed all the high civil officers left by Theodosius when he had given the Western half of the empire to Valentinian, so that Theodosius had lost control of the Western Roman Empire. When a party of Western ambassadors arrived in Constantinople to request that Eugenius be acknowledged as the Western \"augustus\", Theodosius was noncommittal, even if he received them with presents and vague promises. Whether he had already decided on an offensive against Eugenius and Arbogast at this point is unclear. In the end, however, after declaring his son Honorius, then eight years old, as the western \"augustus\" in January of 393, Theodosius finally resolved to invade the West.\n\nOver the following year and a half Theodosius marshalled his forces for the invasion. The Eastern armies had atrophied since the death of the Emperor Valens and most of his soldiers at the Battle of Adrianople. It fell upon the generals Flavius Stilicho and Timasius both to restore discipline to the legions and to bring them back up to strength through recruitment and conscription.\n\nAt the same time another of Theodosius's advisers, the eunuch Eutropius, was sent out from Constantinople to seek the advice and wisdom of an aged Christian monk in the Egyptian town of Lycopolis. According to the accounts of the meeting given by Claudian and Sozomen, the old monk prophesied that Theodosius would achieve a costly but decisive victory over Eugenius and Arbogast.\n\nThe Eastern army set out towards the west from Constantinople in May 394. The re-galvanized legions were bolstered by numerous barbarian auxiliaries including over 20,000 Visigoth federates and additional forces from Syria. Theodosius himself led the army; among his commanders were his own generals Stilicho and Timasius, the Visigoth chieftain Alaric, and a Caucasian Iberian named Bacurios Hiberios.\n\nTheir advance through Pannonia until the Julian Alps was unopposed, and Theodosius and his officers must have had suspicions about what lay ahead when they discovered that the eastern ends of the mountain passes were undefended. Arbogast had, based on his experiences fighting against the usurper Magnus Maximus in Gaul, decided that the best strategy was to keep his forces united to defend Italy itself, and to that end he went so far as to leave the Alpine passes unguarded. Arbogast's forces consisted mainly of his fellow Franks, Alemanni, and Gallo-Romans, plus his own Gothic auxiliaries.\n\nThanks to Arbogast's strategy of maintaining a single, relatively cohesive force, the Theodosian army passed unhindered through the Alps and descended towards the valley of the Frigidus River to the east of the Roman port of Aquileia. It was in this narrow, mountainous region that they came upon the Western army's encampment within the Claustra Alpium Iuliarum in the first days of September.\n\nIt is uncertain exactly where the battle took place. Though it has been claimed that the location of the battle should be sought in the Upper Isonzo Valley, it has mostly been placed somewhere in the Vipava Valley. Whereas the \"Frigidus\" has been usually considered to be the Vipava River or Hubelj Creek and the battle to take place near Vrhpolje, recent research suggests that it actually took place some kilometers away, between Col and Sanabor in the so called \"Door to Roman Italia\".\n\nBefore the battle, Eugenius and Arbogast placed a statue of Jupiter on the edge of the battlefield, and had applied images of Hercules on the army banners. This way they hoped to repeat the victories of Rome in earlier days, when it had always relied on the old gods for support in battle. On the first day of battle the old gods seemed to be winning. Theodosius attacked almost immediately, having undertaken little to no prior reconnaissance of the field of battle. He committed his Gothic allies to action first, perhaps hoping to thin their ranks through attrition and lessen their potential threat to the Empire. The Eastern army's headlong attack resulted in heavy casualties but little gain: 10,000 of the Gothic auxiliaries are reported to have been slain, and the Georgian general Bacurius was among the dead.\n\nDay's end saw Eugenius celebrating his troops' successful defense of their position while Arbogast sent out detachments to close off the mountain passes behind Theodosius's forces.\n\nAfter a sleepless night, Theodosius was cheered by the news that the men Arbogast had sent to bottle him up in the valley intended to desert to his side. Buoyed by this favorable development, Theodosius' men attacked once again. This time nature was on their side as a fierce tempest—apparently the bora, a regular occurrence in the region—blew along the valley from the east.\nOther stories tell of Theodosius praying to God for a storm, which God subsequently granted.\n\nThe high winds blew clouds of dust into the faces of the Western troops (legend also says that the fierce winds even blew the Western troops' own arrows back at them). Buffeted by the winds, Arbogast's lines broke and Theodosius gained the decisive victory that the Egyptian monk had prophesied.\n\nIn the aftermath, Eugenius was captured and brought before the emperor. His pleas for mercy went unanswered and he was beheaded. Arbogast escaped the defeat and fled into the mountains, but after a few days' wandering, he concluded escape was impossible and committed suicide.\n\nWhile the version of the battle in which a divine wind defeated the pagan enemies of Theodosius became popular in late antiquity, modern historians, most notably Alan Cameron, have disputed the reliability of this version of events. Cameron asserts that the idea that Eugenius and Arbogastes were pagans or supporters of pagans was created to justify Theodosius' campaign against them, and that other usurpers, such as Magnentius, were falsely branded as pagans after their defeat. The idea that Theodosius' enemies were pagans originates in the church historian Rufinus, and only the sources dependent on Rufinus mention this idea.\n\nIn addition, the earliest source to mention the decisive bora wind was Ambrose of Milan, but he states in his sermon on Psalm 36 that the wind blew before that battle, and demoralized Theodosius' enemy before any fighting began. This idea was probably picked up by the poet Claudian, who, in his fanciful and propagandistic poetry for the Theodosian family, moved the wind to the decisive moment of the battle. Claudian seems to have been making a classicizing allusion to Silius Italicus, whose account of the Battle of Cannae mentioned a similar wind blowing spears and weapons back. From Claudian's poetry, which was popular in both eastern and western halves of the Roman Empire, the idea of the bora wind deciding the battle spread. It fit well with the other idea that the battle was one between pagans and Christians: Theodosius, as the Christian emperor, was aided by God in the form of the wind.\n\nIt had been a costly but total victory for Theodosius, and a total loss for Eugenius. The western provinces quickly submitted to Theodosius. A mere four months later he died, leaving the government in the hands of his young children Honorius and Arcadius.\n\nMost significantly, the battle has often been seen as the last attempt to contest the Christianization of the empire. According to Rufinus, the battle is on a par with the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in importance, for it was seen not only as a victory in a civil war, but a vindication of the Christian God and the triumph of Christianity – within a generation the elite pagan families of Rome would give up any serious resistance to Christianity.\n\nHowever, the battle also accelerated the collapse of the Roman army in the west. The legions were already losing their effectiveness, due to reorganizations and a decline in the quality of their training and discipline. The losses at the Battle of the Frigidus weakened the western legions. This downturn in the capabilities of the Roman soldiers meant an increasing reliance by the Empire on barbarian mercenaries employed as \"foederati\", who often proved to be unreliable, or even treacherous.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2221878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221878", "title": "Battle of Stromboli", "text": "Battle of Stromboli\n\nThe naval Battle of Stromboli sometimes called the Second Battle of Stromboli or the Battle of Alicuri, took place on 8 January 1676 during the Franco-Dutch War between a French fleet of 20 ships under Abraham Duquesne and a combined fleet of 19 allied ships (18 Dutch and one Spanish ship) under Lieutenant-Admiral-General Michiel de Ruyter that lasted eight hours and ended inconclusively. The fleets fought again at the Battle of Augusta.\n\nAt the end of the Franco-Spanish War, the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 provided for Louis XIV to marry Maria Theresa, the eldest daughter of Philip IV of Spain, who was to bring a substantial dowry to Louis and who renounced her right to inherit the Spanish throne. The dowry was never paid. On the death Philip IV in September 1665, his infant son Charles II of Spain the child of Philip's second wife Mariana of Austria was proclaimed king. Mariana's nearest male relative, the Emperor Leopold might therefore have had a claim to the Spanish throne if Charles died childless, so Louis therefore claimed that, since Maria Theresa's dowry had not been paid, her renunciation was invalid, and under an obscure Netherlands law, that as child of Philip IV's she rather than Charles II should have inherited, and that Maria Theresa's rights \"devolved\" to him as her husband. The French invasion of the Spanish Netherlands in 1667 in the War of Devolution was initially very successful, with the ending of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch began discussions with England and Sweden on creating a diplomatic alliance to protect Spain against France. The subsequent the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle signed in May 1668 gave Louis XIV much less Spanish territory than he had expected, and his resentment of the Dutch intervention decided him to detach England and Sweden from their alliance with the Dutch and prepare for war against the United Netherlands.\n\nFrance then invaded the United Netherlands in May 1672, initiating the Franco-Dutch War. Louis however refused a Dutch offer of very favourable peace terms made in June 1672, and the Dutch retreated behind the Dutch Water Line, a barrier of inundations, and prepared to resist the French by land and sea. In July 1674, the city of Messina in Sicily had revolted against Spanish rule and then asked for French protection. A small French squadron with a few troops and limited food supplies was sent to Messina in September 1674, but it withdrew before the year end in the face of a Spanish fleet of 22 ships and numerous galleys. A stronger French force of 20 ships, including nine ships of the line, and supply convoy managed to break through the Spanish blockade and defeat the more numerous Spanish fleet in a battle off the Lipari Islands on 11 February 1675, capturing one Spanish warship, and it brought the Spanish blockade of Messina to an end and provided considerable food supplies to the city. This battle is sometimes referred to as the First Battle of Stromboli.\n\nThe Spanish then asked for Dutch assistance. Michiel de Ruyter was sent to the Mediterranean with eighteen larger warships and a number of smaller vessels although, because Dutch resources had been strained by the continuing Franco-Dutch War, these were not fully manned and de Ruyter thought the force was insufficient. After waiting for two months on the Spanish coast for the supplies promised by the Spanish authorities and for a Spanish squadron to join him, de Ruyter sailed for Sicily at the year end with only one Spanish ship added to his fleet. This delay may have saved Messina, as its food supplies were short and, had de Ruyter not been delayed, the Dutch fleet may have prevented its reprovisioning. The news that de Ruyter was on his way prompted the French viceroy of Messina, firstly to send a force to attack Augusta by land and sea, as its capture would deny the Dutch a suitable harbour near Messina and, secondly, to send Duquesne to France to escort a convoy that would reprovision Messina. \n\nAt the time of de Ruyter arrival in Sicily in early January 1676, most of the larger French warships were absent from Messina with Duquesne, who was escorting the convoy to Sicily, and only the smaller ones remained at Messina under Lieutenant-Général Guillaume d'Alméras. However, de Ruyter was unable to attack Messina because of contrary winds and, on 7 January 1676, while cruising near the Lipari Islands, he encountered the French fleet led by Duquesne and the convoy it was escorting.\n\nThe French aimed to bring the convoy into Messina intact and to preserve their fleet as a fighting force whereas the Dutch wished to prevent the fleet and convoy reaching Messina or to do as much damage to them as possible. Although ship numbers on both sides were similar, the French fleet was more powerful, with 1,500 guns against 1,200 for the Dutch On 7 January, de Ruyter had held the weather gauge, but either he did not attack on that day, or Duquesne foiled his attack by remaining out of range. However, during the night the wind veered to a west-southwesterly direction and, as both fleets were heading almost due south, it now favoured the French. The wind had also strengthened overnight, so the Spanish galleys had taken refuge in the lee of the Lipari Islands: Duquesne therefore sent the convoy ahead and prepared to attack the Dutch. Each fleet was in three squadrons with its commander in the centre. The French van was commanded by the Marquis de Preuilly d'Humières, a chef d'escadre and the rear by Louis Gabaret, another chef d'escadre. The Dutch Third Squadron led the Dutch fleet, commanded by its \"Schout-bij-nacht\", Nikolaas Verschoor, with Vice-Admiral Jan den Haan commanding the First squadron in the rear.\n\nFrom about 9am, Duquesne's ships steered obliquely towards the Dutch fleet, a tactic that exposed them to Dutch broadside fire to which they could only respond with a few guns. De Ruyter's van and centre reacted by gradually giving way so that their French opponents could not get close to them and remained at a disadvantage, subject to full Dutch broadsides. The two French ships at the front of Preuilly d'Humières, van, \"Prudent\" and \"Parfait\" suffered most severely from heavy Dutch fire during their oblique approach, and both had to pull out of the line of battle, disordering the van, masking the fire of some if its ships and causing their commander in \"Saint Michel\" to be exposed to the simultaneous fire of several Dutch warships. Although Duquesne was wounded, he managed to restore order to the van and tried several times to break the Dutch line with the French van and centre, although de Ruyter's close linear formation, his manoeuvering and the weight of Dutch broadsides prevented this. \n\nTo the rear, some vessels in Gabaret's squadron were mishandled and ran into one another and the French rear as a whole failed to close with den Haan's ships. Den Haan's squadron, which had initially been a greater distance from Gabaret's squadron than the rest of the Dutch fleet was from its opponents, maintained a steady course instead of goving way, so a gap developed between it and de Ruyter's centre. However, as the wind had become very light during the day, the French could not exploit this gap. After about six hours of fighting, the two fleets were on parallel courses, sailing south-southwest in a very light breeze, and firing ceased in the van and centre, although it continued between the two rear squadrons for some hours longer. Three badly damaged Dutch ships were towed by Spanish galleys into Milazzo, and de Ruyter disengaged and took his fleet into Milazzo as well. He had successfully defended his inferior fleet in a tactically disadvantageous leeward position and inflicted significant damage on the French fleet. \n\nBoth sides had suffered significant damage to many ships and the Dutch \"Essen\" from Verschoor's Third Squadron sank the next day. However, the Dutch had inflicted more casualties on the French during their oblique approach. During the night, the wind strengthened, and Duquesne was joined by d'Alméras with eight ships from Messina, but the next day the Spanish squadron was sighted and Duquesne did not wish to fight an action against superior numbers in the Straits of Messina encumbered by a convoy, so he took his convoy right around Sicily, but succeeded in bringing it into Messina without further fighting. The combined Dutch-Spanish fleet sailed to Palermo for repairs, and there were no further fleet actions for several months.\n\nFrance (Duquesne) \n\n\n\nNetherlands/Spain (Michiel de Ruyter)\n\"Zwarte Tas\" 4 (fireship, Jacob Stadtlander)\n\n\n\nThe combined fleet was also accompanied by a number of Spanish galleys. \n\n"}

{"id": "2221932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221932", "title": "U.S. 500", "text": "U.S. 500\n\nThe U.S. 500 was an automobile race sanctioned by CART on May 26, 1996, at the Michigan International Speedway as an alternative to the 1996 Indianapolis 500. For the 1996 CART season, it was the first of two events at Michigan, the second being the traditional Marlboro 500 in July.\n\nTony George, owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, formed the Indy Racing League as an alternative to CART. While the Indianapolis 500 had continued to be sanctioned by the United States Auto Club (USAC) since the formation of CART in 1979, CART teams and drivers represented the vast majority of the Indy field, and USAC had taken steps to ensure that the technical specifications for Indy did not preclude CART teams from participating. In 1996, however, following his creation of the IRL, George stipulated that 25 of the 33 starting positions at Indy would be reserved for the top 25 cars which ran events in his series. This move created potential scheduling conflicts with CART-sanctioned events.\n\nInterpreting this policy as a lockout of CART teams, the CART board agreed to stage the U.S. 500 at an alternative venue on Memorial Day weekend, the traditional date for the Indianapolis 500. George, on the other hand, viewed the refusal of CART teams to compete for the remaining eight positions on the Indy grid as a walkout/boycott.\n\nWhile the Indianapolis 500 has a history of one-off participants (teams and drivers who participate in only the single race and not in other series events), the field for the U.S. 500 were comprised almost exclusively of teams and drivers who participated in the full CART season, as CART was formed of franchises owned by the various team owners, which formed the organization in 1978. CART franchise owners were required to field teams for all races.\n\n\nCART scheduled what was billed as a \"Special Qualifying Session\" for the U.S. 500 on the weekend of May 11–12, 1996. Cold temperatures and reported snow flurries hampered the session at Michigan, although it was completed as scheduled.\n\nThe move was exclusive in that all other CART events featured qualifying the same weekend of the race. Qualifying directly conflicted with the first weekend of qualifying for the Indianapolis 500. The move effectively prevented teams potentially competing at both events from having hopes of qualifying for the pole position at both races. Teams would return two weeks later for the race.\n\nJimmy Vasser won the first such race in 1996, which was notable for its disastrous start. With the cars lined up in rows of three (the traditional starting formation of the Indy 500), Vasser, on pole, was about to take the green flag at the start, when he was struck by Adrian Fernandez. Fernandez then tagged Bryan Herta, and the resulting accident took out a number of cars. Though ten cars had wrecked out, CART allowed teams to bring out backup cars and make repairs to heavily-damaged cars; this hurt the credibility of CART for allowing what normally would have been DNFs to come back out as though nothing had happened; years earlier Roberto Guerrero, the polesitter for the 1992 Indianapolis 500, crashed on the pace lap and was ruled a DNF.\n\nWith the victory, Vasser won over $1 million and had his likeness inscribed onto the Vanderbilt Cup. In addition, an American flag was waved along with the twin checkered flags to end the race.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the 1996 season, CART decided not to run the U.S. 500 opposite the Indianapolis 500 again. The race, as it had been initially created, was discontinued. The success of the event was questionable, and the remaining reasons to hold the event were the subject of considerable debate. Teams and officials also were not keen on racing at the same facility twice in the same season. From 1997–1999, instead of creating a direct conflict, on the day before the Indianapolis 500, CART scheduled a race at the newly opened Gateway International Speedway as their Memorial Day weekend alternative. The race, however, experienced much less interest, and was eventually moved to August.\n\nStarting in 1997, the Indy Racing League adopted new chassis and engine rules that were not compatible with the equipment used by CART teams, thus any teams choosing to race at Indianapolis would have to purchase all new machines. After experiencing unforeseen problems unrelated to the CART boycott, the IRL's 25/8 restriction for the Indianapolis 500 was dropped after the 1997 race. No CART team, however, would return to Indianapolis until 2000.\n\nIn 1997, Penske Corporation and CART added a season-ending race for the Champ Cars at California Speedway. As a result, some name-shuffling ensued. The \"Marlboro 500\" name, which had been used for the 500-mile event held at Michigan in July or August from 1987 to 1996, was given to the new fall California Speedway race. The \"U.S. 500\" was in turn the name given to the annual summer Michigan race, now being held in July, from 1997–1999.\n\nIn the 1998 race, three spectators were killed and six more injured when a wheel from Adrian Fernández's car flew into the grandstands during a crash on lap 175 of the 250 lap race. CART was widely criticized for not stopping the race in deference to the dead and injured fans, though races in previous years were not stopped despite fatalities. CART's own investigation determined that the casualties were the result of an \"accidental racing incident.\" However, the track's fences were quickly extended by an additional four feet in an attempt to contain debris from future crashes.\n\nIn 2000, the \"U.S. 500\" name was dropped permanently as the race was changed to the Michigan 500 presented by Toyota, and in its last year, 2001, it was known as the Harrah's 500. In 2002, the race switched alliances to the Indy Racing League, and became what was known as the Firestone Indy 400.\n\n\"For open-wheel races held at Michigan International Speedway prior to and after the U.S. 500, see: Firestone Indy 400\".\n"}

He served as deputy to Pope Paul VI, and as President of the Secretariat for Non-Christians from 1973 to 1980. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1973.\n\nA towering figure in the Roman Catholic Church, cardinal Sergio Pignedoli was Pope Paul VI closest ally and confidant, and was widely expected to succeed him as Pope. Following the death of Paul VI in 1978, cardinal Sergio Pignedoli was the leading contender to be elected Pope. He was featured in numerous publications around the world, including on the covers of Time and Newsweek as the next Pope. In the August 1978 conclave, cardinal Pignedoli, the progressive candidate, received nearly half of the votes of the college of cardinals. His main opponent was the conservative cardinal Giuseppe Siri of Genova, though since both of these legendary cardinals were unable to obtain a majority, a compromise candidate has emerged, and Albino Luciani was elected as Pope John Paul I. Thirty three days later, following the sudden death of John Paul I, a second conclave convened in October 1978. Cardinal Pignedoli was again the leading contender for the papacy, but ultimately Karol Józef Wojtyła of Poland was elected as Pope John Paul II.\n\nIn 1975, at the request of Pope Paul VI, cardinal Sergio Pignedoli, the second most powerful Vatican figure after the Pope, has developed a close, secret, friendship and alliance with a young, super-gifted, Jewish scientist and scholar descended from the House of Kalonymus. Their close cooperation laid the foundation for the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and the Vatican, thus ending two thousand years of animosity and persecution by Christians and the Holy See against the Jews.\n\nBorn in Felina di Reggio Emilia, Sergio Pignedoli studied at the seminary in Reggio Emilia, the Catholic University of Milan (where he received a doctorate in ancient studies), the Pontifical Lateran University (obtaining a doctorate in theology), and the Pontifical Gregorian University (master's in ecclesiastical history) before being ordained a priest on 1 April 1933. He then served as vice-rector of the seminary in Reggio Emilia until 1934, at which time he became a chaplain at the Catholic University of Milan. During World War II, from 1940 to 1943, Pignedoli served as a navy chaplain, and continued his work as a chaplain in Azione Cattolica and the Italian Boy Scouts. Named Monsignor on 5 September 1949, he was also the Secretary of the Central Committee for the 1950 Holy Year, on which he commented, \"This year's great discovery is that in a world apparently skeptical and indifferent, there's a vigorous current of faith\".\n\nOn 22 December 1950, he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Iconium and Nuncio to Bolivia. Pignedoli received episcopal consecration on 11 February 1951 from Cardinal Adeodato Giovanni Piazza, OCD, with Archbishop Valerio Valeri and Bishop Beniamino Socche serving as co-consecrators, in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. After serving as Nuncio to Bolivia for four years, he was named Nuncio to Venezuela on 19 October 1954. On 15 April 1955, he was named Auxiliary Bishop of Milan, where he remained until 23 September 1960; during his time in Milan, Pignedoli established a deep friendship with Giovanni Battista Montini that continued into the latter's rise to the papacy. From 1960 until 1967, he held the positions of Apostolic Delegate to Western and Central Africa (1960-1964) and to Canada (1964-1967). Pignedoli also attended the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965).\n\nPope Paul VI appointed Pignedoli as Secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples on 10 June 1967. He was created Cardinal-Deacon of \"S. Giorgio al Velabro\" by Paul VI in the consistory of 5 March 1973. On the following day, 6 March, he became the second President of the Secretariat for Non-Christians (later renamed the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue by Pope John Paul II on 28 June 1988).\n\nOn 24 May 1974, before his trip to West Africa, Cardinal Pignedoli joined by Monsignor Verrazano, met with A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Together they had an hour-long dialogue about social analysis and outreach ministry.\n\nPignedoli also established close friendships with Shōchō Hagami, a great acharya of Tendai Buddhism and one of the most prominent Japanese Buddhists of the 20th century, who played a leading role in promoting mutual respect and reconciliation among three monotheistic religions from an Asian side.\n\nIn his capacity of cardinal, Pignedoli was one of the electors in the conclaves of August and October 1978, which selected Pope John Paul I and Pope John Paul II respectively. He was considered by many as a \"papabile\" in both of those conclaves.\n\nPignedoli died from a pulmonary embolism during a visit to his native Reggio Emilia, at age 70.\n\n\n"}

It is located on the northern edge of the mountain plateau on which central Jerusalem lies. It is named after Mattersburg (formerly \"Mattersdorf\"), a town in Austria with a long Jewish history. It borders Kiryat Itri and Romema. The main thoroughfare is Panim Meirot Street, which segues into Sorotzkin Street at the neighborhood's eastern end. In 2015, Kiryat Mattersdorf had approximately 700 residents.\n\nA lesser known name for the neighborhood is Kiryat Sheva Kehillos, in memory of the Siebengemeinden (Seven Communities) of Burgenland which were destroyed in the Holocaust, Mattersdorf being one of them.\n\nKiryat Mattersdorf was founded in 1958 by the Mattersdorfer Rav, Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld, whose ancestors had served as Rav of the Austrian town of Mattersdorf for centuries, starting with his great-great-grandfather, the Chasam Sofer, in 1798. When the community was evicted from Austria during the Anschluss of 1938, the Mattersdorfer Rav re-established his yeshiva in New York. On one of his visits to Israel in 1958, accompanied by Rav Avrum Mayer Israel, Honyader Ruv, he purchased the land and established a new neighborhood in commemoration of the seven communities of Burgenland, Mattersdorf among them, that had been destroyed by the Nazis. 1959, he sent one of his sons, Rabbi Akiva Ehrenfeld, to supervise the construction and selling of apartments and public institutions in the new neighborhood.\nAmong the institutions that the Mattersdorfer Rav set up were Talmud Torah Maaneh Simcha; Yeshiva Maaneh Simcha; two synagogues named Heichal Shmuel, one for nusach Ashkenaz, and one for nusach Sefard; and the Neveh Simcha nursing home, named after his father. The outermost street in the neighborhood is named Maaneh Simcha after his father's Torah work. Akiva Ehrenfeld moved to Kiryat Mattersdorf in the early 1990s, and served as president of all these institutions. Akiva Ehrenfeld also founded Yeshivas Beis Shmuel, named for his father, in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe cornerstone for the neighborhood was laid in spring 1963, and the first apartments were ready for occupancy in May 1965. The first occupants included Rabbi Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg and his wife Bessie; his son Rabbi Simcha Scheinberg and his family; his daughter Rebbetzin Fruma Rochel Altusky and her family; and more than 20 students from Rabbi Chaim Scheinberg's yeshiva, Torah Ore. Akiva Ehrenfeld was the one who encouraged Scheinberg to relocate his yeshiva to Jerusalem from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, offering attractive terms for apartments and land for the yeshiva at the southeast end of the neighborhood. Ehrenfeld also encouraged other Torah institutions to populate the community.\n\nKiryat Mattersdorf was the first neighborhood to be built in northern Jerusalem; it was joined in subsequent years by Kiryat Itri, Kiryat Unsdorf, Kiryat Sanz, and HaMem Gimmel Street of northern Romema. For many years, the neighborhood was situated on Jerusalem's northern border, facing Jordanian strongholds across the valley in present-day Ramot. The main street has always been known as Rechov Panim Meirot (Panim Meirot Street), after the sefer \"Panim Meirot\" by Rabbi Meir Eisenshtadt.\n\nAkiva Ehrenfeld established close ties with the government of Austria to obtain funding for several institutions, including Neveh Simcha and a kindergarten. Following an official state visit to Israel by Austrian President Thomas Klestil in 1994, which included a side tour of Kiryat Mattersdorf, Klestil hosted Ehrenfeld at an official reception at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna on January 24, 1995.\n\nMost of the inhabitants of Kiryat Mattersdorf identify with the Litvish style of Haredi Judaism. Many are olim from the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nNotable rabbis who live in Kiryat Mattersdorf include Rabbis Zelig Pliskin, Moshe Sacks, Nota Schiller, Chaim Brovender, and Yosef Savitzky. Rabbis Simcha Wasserman, Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg, Mendel Weinbach, and Shlomo Lorincz were long-time residents. Rabbi Yitzchok Yechiel Ehrenfeld, grandson of Shmuel Ehrenfeld and son of Akiva Ehrenfeld, is the Rav of Kiryat Mattersdorf.\n\nThe Torah Ore yeshiva founded by Rabbi Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg and the Chasan Sofer network of schools and yeshivas formerly headed by Rabbi Akiva Ehrenfeld are the major institutions for boys and young men in the neighborhood. Girls' schools include Beis Yaakov of Mattersdorf and Vizhnitz School for Girls.\n"}

Years after her death, the record was discovered in the archives of the Kharkov Choral Synagogue, where her father had been a board member: the birth of a daughter, Ida Lvovna, on 21 September (O.S., N.S. 5 October), to father Lev Ruvimovich, Honorary Citizen of Kharkov, and mother Ernestina Isaakovna Rubinstein, had been dutily recorded in the registry for 1883. She had an older sister, Rachel, born in 1876.\n\nIda's grandfather, Ruvim (Roman) Rubinstein, had been a successful sugar trader in Kharkov. He moved to Saint Petersburg, where he founded the company, Roman Rubinstein & Sons, with his two sons, Lev (Leon) and Adolf (Anton). The family multiplied their investment many times over, becoming millionaires by the time Ida was born. The family expanded to own several banks, including the First Bank of Kharkov, sugar mills and breweries.\n\nThe family donated large sums of money to charities, particularly the arts. Lev and Adolf were both well educated; they regularly hosted prominent intellectuals and artists in their home. Adolf's son Iosif became a successful pianist who studied under Franz Liszt.\n\nHer mother died when Ida was very young, and in 1892, her father died in Frankfurt, leaving her a vast fortune. In 1893, the 8-year-old Ida was sent to Saint Petersburg to live with her aunt, socialite \"Madame\" Gorvits (Horwitz). Rubinstein grew up in her aunt's mansion on the city's famed \"Promenade des Anglais\", where she was given the best education. She became fluent in English, French, German and Italian. When she became interested in Ancient Greece, a Greek professor was invited to tutor her in Saint Petersburg.\n\nShe was also given the best instruction in music, dance and theatre, including lessons from instructors from the Russian imperial theatres. She lacked natural dance ability, but she worked constantly on her posture, movements and pirouettes. Eventually, secretly intent on going on stage herself, she went to Paris under the guise of continuing her education.\n\nIn Paris, Rubinstein began her career as an actress, appearing on stage in various stages of \"indecent\" garb. The news reached Saint Petersburg and the ears of her conservative Orthodox family. While it was perfectly respectable for the upper class to be seen at the theatre, being an actress was no different from being a prostitute in the eyes of her horrified relatives. Her brother-in-law, a Parisian doctor named Lewinsohn (Levinson), had her declared legally insane in order to commit her to a mental asylum to save the family's honor.\n\nHer family in Kharkov and Saint Petersburg, unhappy with her being in an asylum, demanded she be released and sent home. Once in Saint Petersburg, she was chaperoned at all times by her governess, as was customary for an unmarried young woman of her social class. To earn her freedom and right to control her fortune, she married her first cousin Vladimir Gorvits, who was madly in love with her and allowed her to travel and perform.\n\nShe had, by the standard of Russian ballet, little formal training. Tutored by Mikhail Fokine, she made her debut in 1908. This was a single private performance of Oscar Wilde's \"Salomé\", in which she stripped nude in the course of the \"Dance of the Seven Veils\".\n\nSergei Diaghilev took her with the Ballets Russes and she danced the title role of \"Cléopâtre\" in the Paris season of 1909, and Zobéide in \"Scheherazade\" in 1910. Both exotic ballets were choreographed by Fokine, and designed by Léon Bakst. The finale of \"Cléopâtre\" inspired Kees van Dongen's \"Souvenir of the Russian Opera Season 1909\". Her partner in \"Scheherazade\" was the great Vaslav Nijinsky. \"Scheherazade\" was admired at the time for its racy sensuality and sumptuous staging, but these days it is rarely performed; to modern tastes, it is considered too much of a pantomime and its then fashionable Orientalism appears dated.\n\nRubinstein left the Ballets Russes in 1911.\n\nAfter leaving the Ballets Russes, Rubinstein formed her own dance company, using her inherited wealth, and commissioned several lavish productions. In 1911, she performed in \"Le Martyre de Saint Sebastien\". The creative team was Fokine (choreography); Bakst (design); Gabriele d'Annunzio (text) and score by Debussy. This was both a triumph for its stylized modernism and a scandal; the Archbishop of Paris prohibited Catholics from attending because St. Sebastian was being played by a woman and a Jew.\n\nAfter the First World War, Rubinstein appeared in a number of plays, and in Staat's \"Istar\" at the Paris Opera in 1924. She also played the leading role in the 1921 silent film \"La Nave\" based on D'Annunzio's play of the same name and directed by his son. Between 1928 and 1929, she directed her own company in Paris with Nijinska as choreographer. She commissioned and performed in Maurice Ravel's \"Boléro\" in 1928. Other works developed in 1928 were Massine's \"David\", with music by Sauguet; and \"Le Baiser de la fée\", with music by Stravinsky, and choreography by Nijinska. The repertoire also included \"The Firebird\" (\"L'Oiseau de Feu\") with music by Stravinsky, and choreography by Fokine; this had been one of the most sensational creations for the Ballets Russes. The company was revived in 1931 and 1934, with new works. She closed the company in 1935, and gave her last performance in the play \"Jeanne d'Arc au bûcher\" in Paris, 1939.\n\nRubinstein often staged free ballet events and continued to dance until the start of the Second World War.\n\nRubinstein is not considered to be in the top tier of ballerinas; she began her training too late for that to have been possible. She did, however, have tremendous stage presence and was able to act. She was also a significant patron and she tended to commission works that suited her abilities, works that mixed dance with drama and stagecraft. In 1934, the French government awarded her the Légion d'honneur, and then in 1939 the Grand Cross of the Légion, its highest honor. In 1935, she was awarded honorary French citizenship, and in 1936 she converted to Roman Catholicism.\n\nIn 1940, she left France during the German invasion, and made her way to England via Algeria and Morocco. There she helped wounded Free French soldiers until 1944. Walter Guinness (later Lord Moyne), her long-term lover and sponsor, remained supportive, providing a suite at the Ritz Hotel, until he was assassinated by the Stern Gang in late 1944. She returned to France after the war, living finally at \"Les Olivades\" in Vence.\n\nRubinstein lived the final 10 years of her life in relative quiet. She died in 1960 in Vence, France, and is buried nearby.\n\nRubinstein was much celebrated in art. Her portrait by Valentin Serov in 1910 marks the most complete realization of his mature style. The Art Deco sculptor Demetre Chiparus produced a Rubinstein figurine, and she was also painted by Antonio de la Gandara and Jacques-Émile Blanche. Costume designer Léon Bakst created numerous images of Rubinstein in various roles. Rubinstein did not like long sittings and earned the reputation of being a difficult subject. For this reason, Blanche and others preferred to work from photographs.\n\nRubinstein was bisexual, and in 1911 she began a three-year affair with the painter Romaine Brooks, who created several striking portraits, including one of the dancer as a nude model for Venus. Brooks' portraits were based on \"an extraordinary series of photographs taken by Brooks at the time\".\n\nBrooks explained Rubinstein's allure to her audiences and artists as follows:\n\nIt was Ida Rubinstein's elusive quality that fascinated. She expressed an inner self that had no particular denomination. Her beauty belonged to those mental images that demand manifestation, and whatever period she represented she became its image. In reality she was the crystallization of a poet's image, a painter's vision, and as such she possessed further significance ... It was her gift for impersonating the beauty of every époque, that marked Ida Rubinstein as unique.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2221977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221977", "title": "Combatant Status Review Tribunal", "text": "Combatant Status Review Tribunal\n\nThe Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRT) were a set of tribunals for confirming whether detainees held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had been correctly designated as \"enemy combatants\". The CSRTs were established July 7, 2004 by order of U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz after U.S. Supreme Court rulings in \"Hamdi v. Rumsfeld\" and \"Rasul v. Bush\" and were coordinated through the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants.\n\nThese non-public hearings were conducted as \"a formal review of all the information related to a detainee to determine whether each person meets the criteria to be designated as an enemy combatant.\" The first CSRT hearings began in July 2004. Redacted transcripts of hearings for \"high value detainees\" were posted to the Department of Defense (DoD) website. As of October 30, 2007, fourteen CSRT transcripts were available on the DoD website.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States found these tribunals to be unconstitutional in \"Boumediene v. Bush\".\n\nThe CSRTs are not bound by the rules of evidence that would apply in court, and the government's evidence is presumed to be \"genuine and accurate.\" The government is required to present all of its relevant evidence, including evidence that tends to negate the detainee's designation, to the tribunal. Unclassified summaries of relevant evidence may be provided to the detainee. The detainee's personal representative may view classified information and comment on it to the tribunal to aid in its determination but does not act as an advocate for the detainee. If the tribunal determines that the preponderance of the evidence is insufficient to support a continued designation as \"enemy combatant\" and its recommendation is approved through the chain of command established for that purpose, the detainee will be informed of that decision upon finalization of transportation arrangements (or earlier, if the task force commander deems it appropriate). The rules do not give a timetable for informing detainees in the event that the tribunal has decided to retain their enemy combatant designations. Article 5 creates a particularized limited process, intended to sort individuals when any doubt exists as to their status. The sole question for determination is whether the captive meets the definition of POW in Article 4 of the Prisoner of War Convention.\n\nSecretary of the Navy Gordon R. England stated:\n\nThus, the tribunals themselves are modeled after the procedures—AR 190-8 Tribunals—the military uses to make determinations in compliance with the Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention (that states \"Should any doubt arise as to whether persons, having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy, belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4, such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.\") This is most likely because, in \"Hamdi v. Rumsfeld\", a plurality of the Supreme Court suggested the Department of Defense empanel tribunals similar to the AR 190 to make factual status determinations. The mandate of the CSRTs and the AR 190-8 Tribunals differed in that AR 190-8 Tribunals were authorized to determine that captives were civilians, who should be released, and \"lawful combatants\", whom the Geneva Conventions protect from prosecution.\n\nThe exact location of the current CSRT hearings is unknown, but prior CSRT hearings were held in trailers in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Images of the trailers, with the white, plastic chairs the detainees sat in shackled to the floor and the large, black leather chair behind a microphone where the President sat can be found on the DoD website.\n\nA dramatization of the conduct of CSRTs, based on CSRT transcripts, is presented in the film \"The Response\".\n\nThe identity of the presiding officers at CSRTs hearings is classified. In the CSRT transcripts released on the DoD website, that information has been removed from the transcripts. The ranks of those present, however, and their service branch remain in the documents. For example, at Guleed Hassan Ahmed's CSRT in April 2007, the CSRT President was a Lieutenant Colonel from the U.S. Air Force. Other services present include the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army; the only other rank mentioned in the transcript was Gunnery Sergeant. In other CSRTs, the ranks, services, and persons present varied. At certain CSRTs, a non-military language analyst was present.\n\nThe CSRT Recorder had several tasks. First, he or she was charged with keeping a record of the CSRT process by recording the CSRT process. Second, the Recorder swore in all the CSRT participants by administering an oath. Third, the Recorder was also charged with presenting classified and unclassified material during the CSRTs. Fourth, the Recorder was often asked to explain or clarify facts or information during the CSRT. In Guleed Hassan Ahmed's CSRT transcript one finds the following exchange:\n\nPRESIDENT:[The]Tribunal has completed its review of the unclassified evidence provided. We do have one question for the Recorder. Is Somalia, Ethiopia, and/or Kenya a coalition partner?<br>\nRECORDER: Somalia is not; Ethiopia is; and Kenya is, a coalition partner of the United States.\n\nDetainees had the option of attending their CSRTs, but attendance was not mandated. Some detainees protested the CSRTs by not attending, opting instead to send personal, written statements to be read before the CSRT in their absence. The reading of a detainee's written statement was the task of The Personal Representative, and this occurred, in one case, with Guleed Hassan Ahmed who did not attend his CSRT and instead sent a statement. When detainees did attend, if required, a translator was typically present to assist the detainee and tribunal members. They are given a copy of the unclassified summary of information, and aided by a \"Personal Representative\".\n\nThe question of the presence of outside, neutral observers at the CSRTs is debated.\n\nMurat Kurnaz is a young Turkish citizen who was born in, and had grown up, in Germany. When captured, he was close to being granted German citizenship, which children of guest workers are required to apply for in a separate process when they come of age. While on a trip to Pakistan in the fall of 2001, he was taken off a tourist bus and detained, then transferred to United States custody. When his case was reviewed by a CSRT in the fall of 2004, the tribunal's determined there was enough evidence that Kurnaz had ties to terrorism to classify and hold him as an enemy combatant.\n\nThrough a bureaucratic slip-up, Kurnaz's file was declassified. During the brief window when it was declassified in March 2005, the \"Washington Post\" reviewed all the evidence against him and published a summary.\n\nJoyce Hens Green, a US District Court judge for the District of Columbia, was assigned in 2004 to coordinate the nearly 60 \"habeas corpus\" cases filed following the US Supreme Court's decision in \"Rasul v. Bush\" (2004) that detainees had the right to due process and to \"habeas corpus\" challenges of their detention. Kurnaz' case was one which she reviewed, and she had the clearance to review both the classified and declassified materials.\n\nGreen found that Kurnaz' file contained some 100 pages of documents and reports explaining that German and American investigators could find no evidence whatsoever that Kurnaz had any ties to terrorism. Shortly before his tribunal an unsigned memo had been added to his file concluding he was an al Qaeda member. Green's comment on the memo was that it:\n\nGreen stated that Kurnaz' case was an \"extreme example of illegal detention\" at Guantanamo.\n\nEugene R. Fidell, a Washington-based expert in military law, said:\n\nPrincipal arguments of why these tribunals are inadequate to warrant acceptance as \"competent tribunal\" are:\n\n\nSome specific cases that call attention to what critics assert is a flawed nature of the CSRT procedure: Mustafa Ait Idir, Moazzam Begg, Murat Kurnaz, Feroz Abbasi, and Martin Mubanga.\nJames Crisfield, the legal advisor to the Tribunals, offered his legal opinion, that CSRT\n\ndo not have the discretion to determine that a detainee should be classified as a prisoner of war -- only whether the detainee satisfies the definition of \"enemy combatant\"\n\nDetermining whether a captive should be classified as a prisoner of war is the purpose of a \"competent tribunal\".\nOn June 29, 2006, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Geneva Conventions should be applied, but only Article 3, which does not require a competent tribunal.\n\nSpecific Combatant Status Review Tribunal hearings have resulted in a variety of outcomes. Many detainees are still being detained, others have been released to return to their homeland, and still others have been classified and cleared for release but remain at Guantanamo Bay and in U.S. custody because their home countries cannot assure their safety.\n\nAccording to the prior Secretary of the Navy Gordon England,\n\nThe basis of detaining captured enemy combatants is not to punish but, rather, to prevent them from continuing to fight against the United States and its coalition partners in the ongoing global war on terrorism. Detention of captured enemy combatants is both allowed and accepted under international law of armed conflict.\n\nIn a surprise move President George W. Bush announced the transfer of 14 \"high-value detainees\" from clandestine CIA custody to military custody in Guantanamo in the fall of 2006.\nPrior to the transfer legal critics had repeatedly stated that the men in covert CIA custody could never be tried because they had been subjected to abusive interrogation techniques, which would invalidate any evidence that flowed from their interrogations. Nevertheless, Bush said the transfer would allow the men, most of whom were considered to be members of the inner circle of al Qaeda's senior leadership, to be tried at Guantanamo Bay using the CSRT procedures. \n\nThe Bush Presidency asserted that the captives had no right to appeal and that they were outside the US judicial systems. Captives who had \"next friends\" willing to initiate the \"habeas corpus\" process filed appeals before US District Courts. \"Rasul v. Bush\" (2004) was the first appeal to make its way to the Supreme Court of the United States. The court ruled that detainees had the right to challenge the basis of their detention, and that the government needed to distinguish between POWs, civilians, and enemy combatants. \n\nTo respond to the Court's ruling, the Bush administration established the Combatant Status Review Tribunals to review whether detainees were properly classified as enemy combatants and began reviews in 2004. It was not until they had determined if a detainee was an enemy combatant that they could proceed to trials by military commissions. In \"Hamdan v. Rumsfeld\" (2006), the Court ruled that the system of military commissions as established by the DoD was illegal and needed to be replaced by a system authorized by Congress. Through the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006, in accordance with Bush administration goals, the United States Congress moved to limit, and then curtail the detainees' ability to file \"habeas corpus\" appeals. The Supreme Court ruled on the outstanding \"habeas corpus\" appeals in \"Al Odah v. United States\" and \"Boumediene v. Bush\" (2008), discussed below.\n\nThe Military Commission Act provides a process by which captives can appeal the decisions of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal and whether it properly followed OARDEC's rules in reaching its determination. If and when captives are able to file these appeals, they would be heard before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Emma Schwartz, in the \"US News and World Report\", on August 30, 2007, reported that her sources told her: \"...Up to one fourth of the department's own civil appellate staff has recently opted out of handling the government's cases against detainee appeals.\"\n\nSeveral amalgamated cases have been initiated in the DC Circuit Court. There is controversy over whether the Appeal Court will have access to all of the evidence against the captives. As of May 2008, none of the cases have proceeded to the point when the judges would consider the merits of the case. \n\nOn June 12, 2008 the Supreme Court ruled in the case \"Boumediene v. Bush\", 5–4, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to access the US justice system.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion:\n\nThe Court also ruled that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were \"inadequate\". Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, David Souter and John Paul Stevens joined Kennedy in the majority.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, in the dissenting opinion, called the CSR Tribunals:\n\nSamuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia joined Roberts in the dissent.\n\nVincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, the organization that initiated the case that the Supreme Court ruled on, said:\n\n\n"}

Though legends vary, all agree that a Scota was the ancestor of the Gaels, who traced their ancestry to Irish invaders, called Scotti, who settled in Argyll and Caledonia, regions which later came to be known as Scotland after their founder. \n\nEdward J. Cowan traced the first mention of Scota in literature to the 12th century. Scota appears in the Irish chronicle \"Book of Leinster\" (containing a redaction of the \"Lebor Gabála Érenn\"). However, a text found in the 11th-century \"Historia Brittonum\" contains an earlier reference to Scota. 12th-century sources state that Scota was the daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh, a contemporary of Moses, who married Geytholos (Goídel Glas), the founder of the Scots and Gaels after being exiled from Egypt. The earliest Scottish sources claim Geytholos was a king of Greece, Neolus or Heolaus, while the \"Lebor Gabála Érenn\" describes him as a Scythian. Other manuscripts of the \"Lebor Gabála Érenn\" contain a variant legend where Míl Espáine appears as Scota's husband, and connects him to ancient Iberia.\n\nA variant myth in the \"Lebor Gabála Érenn\" states that there was another Scota. She was the daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh named Cingris, a name found only in Irish legend. She married Niul, son of Fénius Farsaid. Niul was a Babylonian who traveled to Scythia after the collapse of the Tower of Babel. He was a scholar of languages and was invited by the Pharaoh to Egypt to take Scota's hand in marriage. Scota and Nuil had a son, Goídel Glas, the eponymous ancestor of the Gaels, who created the Gaelic language by combining the best features of the 72 languages then in existence.\n\nBaldred Bisset is credited with being the first to connect the Stone of Scone with the Scota foundation legends in his 1301 work \"Processus\", putting forward an argument that Scotland, not Ireland, was where the original Scota homeland lay.\n\nBisset wanted to legitimize a Scottish (as opposed to English) accession to the throne when Alexander III of Scotland died in 1286. At his coronation in 1249, Alexander himself heard his royal genealogy recited generations back to Scota. Bisset attempted to legitimize a Scottish accession by highlighting Scota's importance as the transporter of the Stone of Scone from Egypt during the exodus of Moses to Scotland. In 1296, the Stone was captured by Edward I of England and taken to Westminster Abbey. In 1323, Robert the Bruce used Bisset's legend connecting Scota to the Stone in an attempt to return it to Scone Abbey in Scotland.\n\nThe 15th-century English chronicler John Hardyng later attempted to debunk Bisset's claims.\n\nAndrew of Wyntoun's \"Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland\" and John of Fordun's \"Chronica Gentis Scotorum\" (1385) are sources of the Scota legends, alongside Thomas Grey's \"Scalacronica\" (1362). Hector Boece's 16th-century \"Historia Gentis Scotorum\" (\"History of the Scottish People\") also mentions the Scota foundation myth.\n\nWalter Bower's 15th-century \"Scotichronicon\" included the first illustrations of the legends.\n\nThe grave of Scota (or Scotia's Grave) allegedly lies in a valley south of Tralee Town, Co. Kerry, Ireland. The area is known as Glenn Scoithin, \"Vale of the Little Flower\", but is more popularly referred to as Foley's Glen (Foley's Glen). A trail from the road leads along a stream to a clearing where a circle of large stones marks the grave site, as indicated by a County Council signpost.\n\n\n"}

It carries the MTR's Airport Express and Tung Chung Line over the Rambler Channel, linking Tsing Yi Station and Lai King Station.\n\nIn 1994, the Mass Transit Railway Corporation awarded the contract to design and construct the bridge to Dragages et Travaux Publics, in partnership with Penta-Ocean Construction. The contract was worth $490 million. The bridge was designed by Bouygues Travaux Publics. Construction began in October 1995. It was structurally completed in February 1997. The bridge began carrying revenue passengers with the opening of the Tung Chung Line on 21 June 1998.\n\nSix construction workers were killed when a metal work platform collapsed on 6 June 1996. The platform, which held four men, plunged 20 metres and crushed two workers below. The men were rushed to Yan Chai Hospital in nearby Tsuen Wan and declared dead shortly after arrival at 6:00 pm. \n\nThose killed were engineer Tam Wai-shing, 40; Yeung Sung-po, 50; Shek Shing, 58; Wong Kam-wo, 30; and brothers-in-law Law Tai-yau, 36, and Cheng Chi-ming, 33.\n\nThe Labour Department launched an investigation to determine the cause of the accident. It was aided by specialists from the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and the Buildings Department. Construction of the bridge was temporarily halted and the Labour Department inspected all similar work platforms across the territory.\n\nThe tragedy was blamed on the wrong type of bolt being used to affix the work platform to a concrete pillar. A Coroner's Court inquest before coroner David Thomas heard that the anchor bolts were only half the length required, were designed to hold electric cables, and were screwed into plastic sockets. The platform collapsed after two of the bolts detached. The weight on the platform exceeded four tonnes, or three times more than the bolts could support.\n\nOn 4 December 1996 the Labour Department issued summonses to Dragages et Travaux Publics; its manager, Didier Noel; and subcontractor Takamura Limited (which built the platform), under charges of breaching general duties provisions under the Factory and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance. Dragages was accused of not providing sufficient training to workers, and failing to ensure the safety of the platform. A representative for Takamura argued against prosecuting the company as it was only responsible for installing the platform.\n\nDragages et Travaux Publics was found solely responsible for the collapse. The company was fined HK$105,000 on 8 August 1997 after admitting to three charges of failing to ensure safety and failing to maintain properly built scaffolding. In October 1997 Takamura Limited (also known as Pacific Island Consultants) was cleared of responsibility for the accident.\n\nThe tragedy was the single greatest loss of life during the Airport Core Programme.\n\nThe bridge is 1,100 metres long. It is made up of precast concrete segments lowered into place by a launching gantry. The bilevel main deck segments are eight metres high and weigh 120 tonnes each. The segments are held together with epoxy glue and high-strength steel tendons.\n"}
{"id": "2221988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221988", "title": "Super Buddies", "text": "Super Buddies\n\nSuper Buddies are a team of comic book superheroes in the DC Comics universe who appeared in the six-issue \"Formerly Known as the Justice League\" miniseries in 2003, and its 2005 sequel, \"I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League\" (published in \"JLA Classified\"). The team was put together by former Justice League bank roller Maxwell Lord as a superhero team \"accessible to the common man\". The team is considered more or less inept and incapable of being of any help by many (including the actual Justice League). The team was created by writers Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis, and artists Kevin Maguire and Joe Rubinstein.\n\nGiffen, DeMatteis, and Maguire had previously created the tongue-in-cheek \"Justice League International\" comic book in the 1990s, and revived a similar style of comedy as that series featured.\n\nMost of the Super Buddies recruited by Maxwell Lord and his robot sidekick L-Ron were former members of Justice League International when Giffen, DeMatteis, and Maguire worked on the series: Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Fire, Ralph Dibny (The Elongated Man) and his wife Sue, and Captain Atom. A seventh former member, Captain Marvel, was recruited by L-Ron, but he turned down the offer. His sister, Mary Marvel, joined in his place.\n\nThe Super Buddies do not and cannot get along: Blue Beetle and Booster Gold, formerly the self-proclaimed \"Abbott and Costello\" of the JLI, now find themselves constantly arguing and fruitlessly attempting to prove to one another that they have matured. No one takes Booster or Ralph Dibny seriously, though not without good reason. Fire runs a website, \"blazingfire.com\", where she makes sensual pictures of herself available for (paid) download, and cannot get along with the polite and innocent Mary Marvel, whom Fire dubs \"Mary Poppins\". In addition, Fire convinces Sue that Ralph rates as \"a four\" (out of ten), giving Ralph an inferiority complex as a result. Captain Atom has no idea why he even \"joined\" the team, and is constantly tense and frustrated around the others. To top it all off, Maxwell Lord plans to fully exploit his employees' images; he sets their headquarters up in a Queens, New York strip mall storefront, making the team available for contact through a 1-800 number and producing a \"Super Friends\"-esque television commercial for the Super Buddies.\n\nThis new team successfully defeats the E-Street Bloodsuckers, a gang of Harvard drop-out super-powered hoodlums, thanks to a well-timed slap from Mary. The Super Buddies are then kidnapped during their first team meeting by Roulette, who brainwashes them into serving as gladiators in her intergalactic metahuman arena. Mary Marvel and Captain Atom are pitted against each other, and the mind-controlled Mary nearly beats Atom and Fire to death before she overcomes her programming and the team is released from captivity.\n\nWhile Beetle and Booster rush a seriously injured (and radioactively leaking) Captain Atom to a hospital, the others find that Manga Khan, L-Ron's former master, has come to Earth to reclaim the robot. Khan offers to trade G'nort, another former JLI member, for possession of L-Ron, but when this offer is refused, and Booster accidentally knocks over several rows of Khan's sentries, Khan declares war on Earth. Only by the intervention of the \"real\" Justice League (who have been spying on the Super Buddies all this time in anticipation of such a faux pas) is an intergalactic crisis avoided.\n\n\"Formerly Known as the Justice League\" proved a popular miniseries, and won the 2004 Eisner Award for Best Comedy Series.\n\nA six-issue sequel to \"Formerly Known as the Justice League\", \"I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League\", was produced by Giffen, DeMatteis, and Maguire in 2004, but its publication was held off until 2005, after DC's \"Identity Crisis\", in which a pregnant Sue Dibny is killed, had run its course. There is a running gag in the miniseries involving whether or not Sue is pregnant.\n\n\"I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League\", published in \"JLA Classified\" #4–9, finds the Super Buddies settling into their roles as superheroes for hire. The Elongated Man is bragging about Sue allegedly being pregnant, when she is, in fact, \"not\" pregnant. Fire and Mary Batson (Mary Marvel's alter ego) become roommates, much to the distaste of Mary's brother Billy Batson (a.k.a. Captain Marvel). Captain Atom has quit the team because of the incident with Mary from the previous miniseries and sued Maxwell Lord, leading him to attempt to recruit both Power Girl and Guy Gardner to join the team. Gardner causes several problems of his own: he is opening a bar next door to the Super Buddies' strip mall headquarters, and he takes delight in sexually harassing Fire, Sue, Power Girl, and Mary Marvel.\n\nWhile visiting the Justice Society of America headquarters, Booster Gold begins messing around with Doctor Fate's talisman and inadvertently wishes the team to Hell. From the depths of Hell, Fire calls Sue for help (on her cell phone, which is then accidentally destroyed), and Power Girl and Guy Gardner are recruited to follow the team to Hell and save them. While in Hell, the Super Buddies work at a labyrinthine version of Big Belly Burger called \"Beelze Burger\". The demons use Mary Batson as a hostage, since her magic word — \"Shazam!\" — does not work in Hell (since the wizard Shazam himself is not present in that plane of existence). Ralph uses his stretching abilities to help foil the demons' plan to torture the Buddies. To the amazement of both Fire and Gardner, the Super Buddies discover Ice, another former JLI member, among the denizens of Hell. Sickened by Fire and Gardner's displays of sorrow, the demons free the group, allowing them to take Ice with them as long as they do not look back on their way out. Fire accidentally looks back, and Ice is snatched back to the afterlife. It is implied that Ice will be sent to Valhalla.\n\nThe group makes its way out of Hell, but soon find themselves trapped in an alternate universe populated by a team of sinister versions of themselves and their fellow heroes called the \"Power Posse\". This team is a group-for-hire who operated out of a strip club owned by a sleazy, or sleazier, version of Maxwell Lord and his moll, a degraded and somewhat dimwitted version of Sue Dibny. The Power Posse consisted of a giant-sized G'nort who began a destructive rampage, sado-masochistic incestuous versions of Captain Marvel (who talked with a lisp) and Mary Marvel, who called herself Mistress Mary, a murderous Ice, now a stripper using the name Tiffany, an even stupider version of Booster working as a bartender, and bouncer Metamorpho. The Fire of this universe had been killed by Tiffany and Sue had divorced Ralph. Doctor Fate finally brings the team back to their correct dimension after they have to do battle with doppelgängers of themselves. Most of the battle takes place on the hairy, insect-infested body of G'nort himself.\n\nIt was revealed in the eighty-page one shot \"Countdown to Infinite Crisis\" (2005) that Maxwell Lord was in fact Checkmate's latest Black King, and had been collecting information on the Justice League members' weaknesses so that he could annihilate them. Blue Beetle had broken into Lord's secret headquarters and discovered his secret, but was murdered by Lord before he could warn anyone.\n\nIn \"The OMAC Project\" #5, the remnants of the Super Buddies (Mary Marvel included) are shown trying to avenge the Blue Beetle's murder, with no success.\n"}

{"id": "2221992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221992", "title": "Lystrosaurus", "text": "Lystrosaurus\n\nLystrosaurus (; 'shovel lizard'; proper Greek is λίστρον \"lístron\" ‘tool for leveling or smoothing, shovel, spade, hoe’) was a herbivorous genus of dicynodont therapsids from the late Permian and Early Triassic epochs (around 250 million years ago). It lived in what is now Antarctica, India, China, Mongolia, European Russia and South Africa. Four to six species are currently recognized, although from the 1930s to 1970s the number of species was thought to be much higher. They ranged in size from that of a small dog to 2.5 meters long.\n\nBeing a dicynodont, \"Lystrosaurus\" had only two teeth (a pair of tusk-like canines), and is thought to have had a horny beak that was used for biting off pieces of vegetation. \"Lystrosaurus\" was a heavily built, herbivorous animal, approximately the size of a pig. The structure of its shoulders and hip joints suggests that \"Lystrosaurus\" moved with a semi-sprawling gait. The forelimbs were even more robust than the hindlimbs, and the animal is thought to have been a powerful digger that nested in burrows.\n\n\"Lystrosaurus\" survived the Permian-Triassic extinction, 252 million years ago. In the Early Triassic, they were by far the most common terrestrial vertebrates, accounting for as many as 95% of the total individuals in some fossil beds. Researchers have offered various hypotheses for why \"Lystrosaurus\" survived the extinction event and prospered in the early Triassic.\n\n\"Lystrosaurus\" was a dicynodont therapsid, between long with an average of about depending upon the species.\n\nUnlike other therapsids, dicynodonts had very short snouts and no teeth except for the tusk-like upper canines. Dicynodonts are generally thought to have had horny beaks like those of turtles, for shearing off pieces of vegetation, which were then ground on a horny secondary palate when the mouth was shut. The jaw joint was weak and moved backwards and forwards with a shearing action, instead of the more common sideways or up and down movements. It is thought that the jaw muscles were attached unusually far forward on the skull and took up a lot of space on the top and back of the skull. As a result, the eyes were set high and well forward on the skull, and the face was short.\n\nFeatures of the skeleton indicate that \"Lystrosaurus\" moved with a semi-sprawling gait. The lower rear corner of the scapula (shoulder blade) was strongly ossified (built of strong bone), which suggests that movement of the scapula contributed to the stride length of the forelimbs and reduced the sideways flexing of the body. The five sacral vertebrae were massive but not fused to each other and to the pelvis, making the back more rigid and reducing sideways flexing while the animal was walking. Therapsids with fewer than five sacral vertebrae are thought to have had sprawling limbs, like those of modern lizards. In dinosaurs and mammals, which have erect limbs, the sacral vertebrae are fused to each other and to the pelvis. A buttress above each acetabulum (hip socket) is thought to have prevented dislocation of the femur (thigh bone) while \"Lystrosaurus\" was walking with a semi-sprawling gait. The forelimbs of \"Lystrosaurus\" were massive, and \"Lystrosaurus\" is thought to have been a powerful burrower.\n\n\"Lystrosaurus\" fossils have been found in many Late Permian and Early Triassic terrestrial bone beds, most abundantly in Africa, and to a lesser extent in parts of what are now India, China, Mongolia, European Russia, and Antarctica (which was not over the South Pole at the time).\n\nMost \"Lystrosaurus\" fossils have been found in the Balfour and Katberg Formations of the Karoo basin in South Africa; these specimens offer the best prospects of identifying species because they are the most numerous and have been studied for the longest time. As so often with fossils, there is debate in the paleontological community as to exactly how many species have been found in the Karoo basin. Studies from the 1930s to 1970s suggested a large number (23 in one case). However, by the 1980s and 1990s, only six species were recognized in the Karoo: \"L. curvatus\", \"L. platyceps\", \"L. oviceps\", \"L. maccaigi\", \"L. murrayi\", and \"L. declivis\". A study in 2011 reduced that number to four, treating the fossils previously labeled as \"L. platyceps\" and \"L. oviceps\" as members of \"L. curvatus\".\n\n\"L. maccaigi\" is the largest and apparently most specialized species, while \"L. curvatus\" was the least specialized. A \"Lystrosaurus\"-like fossil, \"Kwazulusaurus shakai\", has also been found in South Africa. Although not assigned to the same genus, \"K. shakai\" is very similar to \"L. curvatus\". Some paleontologists have therefore proposed that \"K. shakai\" was possibly an ancestor of or closely related to the ancestors of \"L. curvatus\", while \"L. maccaigi\" arose from a different lineage.\n\"L. maccaigi\" is found only in sediments from the Permian period, and apparently did not survive the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Its specialized features and sudden appearance in the fossil record without an obvious ancestor may indicate that it immigrated into the Karoo from an area in which Late Permian sediments have not been found.\n\n\"L. curvatus\" is found in a relatively narrow band of sediments from shortly before and after the extinction, and can be used as an approximate marker for the boundary between the Permian and Triassic periods. A skull identified as \"L. curvatus\" has been found in late Permian sediments from Zambia. For many years it had been thought that there were no Permian specimens of \"L. curvatus\" in the Karoo, which led to suggestions that \"L. curvatus\" immigrated from Zambia into the Karoo. However, a re-examination of Permian specimens in the Karoo has identified some as \"L. curvatus\", and there is no need to assume immigration.\n\n\"L. murrayi\" and \"L. declivis\" are found only in Triassic sediments.\n\n\"Lystrosaurus georgi\" fossils have been found in the Earliest Triassic sediments of the Moscow Basin in Russia. It was probably closely related to the African \"Lystrosaurus curvatus\", which is regarded as one of the least specialized species and has been found in very Late Permian and very Early Triassic sediments.\n\nDr. Elias Root Beadle, a Philadelphia missionary and avid fossil collector, discovered the first \"Lystrosaurus\" skull. Beadle wrote to the eminent paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, but received no reply. Marsh's rival, Edward Drinker Cope, was very interested in seeing the find, and described and named \"Lystrosaurus\" in the \"Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society\" in 1870. Its name is derived from the Ancient Greek words \"listron\" \"shovel\" and \"sauros\" \"lizard\". Marsh belatedly purchased the skull in May 1871, although his interest in an already-described specimen was unclear; he may have wanted to carefully scrutinize Cope's description and illustration.\n\nThe discovery of \"Lystrosaurus\" fossils at Coalsack Bluff in the Transantarctic Mountains by Edwin H. Colbert and his team in 1969–70 helped support the hypothesis of plate tectonics and strengthen the theory, since \"Lystrosaurus\" had already been found in the lower Triassic of southern Africa as well as in India and China.\n\n\"Lystrosaurus\" is notable for dominating southern Pangaea for millions of years during the Early Triassic. At least one unidentified species of this genus survived the end-Permian mass extinction and, in the absence of predators and herbivorous competitors, went on to thrive and re-radiate into a number of species within the genus, becoming the most common group of terrestrial vertebrates during the Early Triassic; for a while, 95% of land vertebrates were \"Lystrosaurus\". This is the only time that a single species or genus of land animal dominated the Earth to such a degree. A few other Permian therapsid genera also survived the mass extinction and appear in Triassic rocks—the therocephalians \"Tetracynodon\", \"Moschorhinus\" and \"Ictidosuchoides\"—but do not appear to have been abundant in the Triassic; complete ecological recovery took 30 million years, spanning the Early and Middle Triassic.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to explain why \"Lystrosaurus\" survived the Permian–Triassic extinction event, the \"mother of all mass extinctions\", and why it dominated Early Triassic fauna to such an unprecedented extent:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is served by the R train at all times.\n\nThe 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. Though it was originally planned to be a four-track express station with two island platforms, only the western platform and tracks were ultimately built. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 86th Street started in 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916, as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from 59th Street to 86th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1926–1927, and it was renovated in the 1970s and again in the late 2000s. The 86th Street station is also being renovated between 2018 and 2020, and elevators are being added to make the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n\nThe 86th Street station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several New York City Transit bus routes.\n\nThe 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. The plan for the line was initially adopted on June 1, 1905, before being approved by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York on June 18, 1906 after the Rapid Transit Commission was unable to get the necessary consents of property owners along the planned route. The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) on July 1, 1907, and the PSC approved the plan for the line in October and November 1907.\n\nAs part of negotiations between New York City and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT. The agreement, known as Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, was signed on March 19, 1913. In 1912, during the Dual System negotiations, the construction of an extension of the Fourth Avenue subway from 43rd Street to 89th Street, just south of the 86th Street station, was recommended. This recommendation was approved by the Board of Estimate on February 15, 1912. The PSC directed its chief engineer to create plans on June 14, 1912. The two contracts for the extension, Route 11B, were awarded on September 16, 1912, to Degnon Construction Company for a combined $3.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ).\n\nOn January 24, 1913, construction began on Route 11B2, which includes this station and extends between 61st Street and 89th Street. Construction was completed on this section in 1915. 86th Street opened on January 15, 1916, as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from 59th Street to 86th Street. The station was the original terminal for the line until a one-stop southward extension to Bay Ridge–95th Street opened on October 25, 1925.\n\nOn June 27, 1922, the New York State Transit Commission directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at 23 stations on the lines of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the successor to the BRT, to accommodate eight-car trains. As part of the project, Bay Ridge Avenue's platforms would have been lengthened from to . Progress on the extensions did not occur until February 16, 1925, when the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at this and eleven other stations along the Fourth Avenue Line. It estimated the project's cost to be $633,000 () (). The BMT had been ordered by the Transit Commission to lengthen these platforms since September 1923. The NYCBOT received bids for the project on February 25, 1926. The contract was awarded to Corson Construction Company for $345,021 () (). The extensions opened on August 1, 1927.\n\nIn the 1960s, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) started a project to lengthen station platforms on its lines in Southern Brooklyn to to accommodate 10-car trains. On July 14, 1967, the NYCTA awarded a contract to conduct test borings at eleven stations on the Fourth Avenue Line, including Bay Ridge Avenue, to W. M. Walsh Corporation for $6,585 () in preparation of the construction of platform extensions (). The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on the project to extend the platforms at stations along the Fourth Avenue Line between 45th Street station and Bay Ridge–95th Street, including this station, on May 3, 1968. \n\nHowever, work had already started on the platform extension project in February 1968. As part of the renovation project, the station's platform were extended to the south, and the station's elaborate mosaic tile walls were removed. The latter change, which was also made to 15 other stations on the BMT Broadway and Fourth Avenue Line, was criticized for being dehumanizing. The NYCTA spokesman stated that the old tiles were in poor condition. Furthermore, it did not consider the old mosaics to have \"any great artistic merit\".\nIn 2007, then-13th District Congressman Vito Fossella and 22nd District State Senator Marty Golden secured funding for an $13.8 million renovation, completed in 2011. The renovation repaired staircases, rebuilt the station's ventilation, and installed new tiling for walls and floors as well as ADA-compliant yellow safety treads along the platform edges. The platform walls were originally tiled, but removed during renovations in 1970. The modern renovation restored these tiles, and added an Arts for Transit glass mosaic inspired by the old homes of the Bay Ridge neighborhood.\n\nPlans call for the addition of two elevators, one from the mezzanine to the platform and the other from the mezzanine to the street, which would make the station fully compliant with accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Construction on the elevators started in June 2018 and elevator completed by May 28, 2020.\n\nThis underground station has two tracks and a single island platform. The R stops here at all times.\n\nThe platform and mezzanines above have dark green columns, and alternate columns have the standard black station name plate with white lettering reading \"86 Street\". The track walls had their mosaic tiling restored as part of the station's 2011 renovation. The southern section of the station is where the platform was extended in 1970, and they have no mosaic trims or tiles along the wall, instead including an extension of the tunnel benchwall. The platform has several employee-facilities that have a mosaic trim line.\n\nThe station is built on the west side of Fourth Avenue due to plans for a possible extension of the express tracks south of 59th Street. The platform is located between what would be the two southbound tracks as north of this station, the current southbound track swings out around the platform while the northbound one remains straight. The additional two tracks would have been built on the eastern side of Fourth Avenue. The four tracks were planned mainly to facilitate the Staten Island Tunnel, which would have necessitated express service, although the tunnel was never constructed. In addition, there are large portions of the mezzanines that are now used for employees only.\n\nThis station has two entrances/exits. The full-time one is at the south end. Two staircases from the platform go up to a mezzanine that has a turnstile bank and bodega within fare control. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and two staircases going up to either southern corner of 86th Street and Fourth Avenue.\n\nThe station's other fare control area is unstaffed. Two staircases from the platform, one of which is now closed, go up to a mezzanine that has two High Entry/Exit Turnstiles and a single staircase going up to the southwest corner of 85th Street and Fourth Avenue. Both mezzanines have their original mosaic trim line.\n\nThe station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several New York City Transit lines, including the local and limited buses and the S79 Select Bus Service to Staten Island.\n\n"}

The terrain ranges from flat to rolling plains.\n\nThe most important Hungarian writers inspired by and associated with the plain are Ferenc Móra and Zsigmond Móricz, as well as the poets Sándor Petőfi and Gyula Juhász.\n\nHungarian scientists born on the plain include Zoltán Bay, physicist; János Irinyi, chemist, inventor of the noiseless match; János Kabay, pharmacologist; Gábor Kátai, physician and pharmacist; and Frigyes Korányi, physician and pulmonologist.\n\nThe most important river of the plain is Tisza.\n\nThe notable cities and towns with medicinal baths are Berekfürdő, Cserkeszőlő, Gyula, Hajdúszoboszló, Szentes and Szolnok.\n\nAmong the cultural festivals and programmes characteristic of the region are the ' (Csángó Festival) in Jászberény, the ' (Sweet Cherry Festival) in Nagykörű, the ' (Goulash Festival) in Szolnok, the ' (Bridge Fair) in Hortobágy National Park, the ' at Ópusztaszer, the ' (Open-air Games) in Szeged, the ' (Castle Games) in Gyula, the ' (Flower Carnival) in Debrecen and the \"\" (Fisherman's Soup Boiling Festival) in Baja.\n\nThe part of the plain located in Hungary comprises the following areas:\n\nThe term is used in Serbia to denote the Hungarian portion of the Pannonian plain.\n\nThe portion of the Pannonian plain in Serbia is mostly divided into 3 large geographical areas: Bačka, Banat and Srem (Syrmia), most of which are located in the Vojvodina province.\n\nThe term is rarely used in Croatia, and is usually associated there with the geography of Hungary.\n\nParts of Pannonian Croatia can be considered an extension of \"Alföld\", particularly eastern Slavonia and the connected parts of Syrmia.\n\nThe portion of the plain located in Slovakia is known as the Eastern Slovak Lowland.\n\nThe part of the plain located in Ukraine is known as the Transcarpathian Lowland.\n\nIn Romania, the plain (Rom. câmp or câmpia, from Lat. campus) includes the regions of Banat and Crişana. It is referred to in Romanian) as \"The Western Plain\" (\"Câmpia de Vest\").\n\nDuring the prehistoric era, the Great Hungarian Plain was a place of cultural and technological changes, as well as an important meeting point of cultures of Eastern and Western Europe. It is a region of great archaeological importance to major European cultural transitions.\n\nAgriculture began in the Great Hungarian Plain with the Early Neolithic Körös culture, located in present-day Serbia, 6.000-5.500 B.C.E. followed 5.500 B.C.E. by the Linear Pottery culture(LBK) which later became the dominant agricultural culture of Europe. The LBK was followed by the Lengyel culture in the Late Neolithic 5000-3400 BC.\n\nDuring the Early Bronze Age (2.800 - 1.800 BC), the growing demand for metal ores in Europe resulted in the new pan-European and intercontinental trade networks. During that period cultures of the Great Hungarian Plain incorporated many elements from the other cultures of Bronze Age Near Eastern, Steppe and Central Europe\n\nDuring the early Iron Age (first millennium BC), a variant of the Central European Hallstatt culture inhabited Transdanubia, while pre-Scythian and later Scythian cultures were found in the eastern region of the Great Hungarian Plain.\n\nIn 2014, a major study of DNA from burials in the Great Hungarian Plain was published. The 5,000-year record indicated significant genomic shifts at the beginning of the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages, with periods of stability in between. The earliest Neolithic genome was similar to other European hunter-gatherers and surprisingly there was no evidence of lactase persistence at that period. The most recent samples, from the Iron Age, showed an eastern genomic influence contemporary with introduced Steppe burial rites. There was also a transition towards lighter pigmentation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2222013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222013", "title": "Albion W. Tourgée", "text": "Albion W. Tourgée\n\nAlbion Winegar Tourgée (May 2, 1838 – May 21, 1905) was an American soldier, lawyer, writer, politician, and diplomat. Wounded in the Civil War, he relocated to North Carolina afterward, where he became involved in Reconstruction activities. He served in the constitutional convention and later in the state legislature. A pioneer civil rights activist, he founded the National Citizens' Rights Association, and founded Bennett College as a normal school for freedmen in North Carolina (it has been a women's college since 1926).\n\nKnown as an ally of African Americans, later in his career, Tourgée was asked to aid a committee in New Orleans to challenge segregation on railways in Louisiana, and he litigated what is known as the landmark \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" (1896). They were dismayed by the United States Supreme Court ruling that \"separate but equal\" public facilities were constitutional; this enabled segregation for decades. Historian Mark Elliott credits Tourgée with introducing the metaphor of \"color-blind justice\" into legal discourse.\n\nBorn in rural Williamsfield, Ohio, on May 2, 1838, Tourgée was the son of farmer Valentine Tourgée and his wife Louisa Emma Winegar. His mother died when he was five. He attended common schools in Ashtabula County and in Lee, Massachusetts, where he lived for two years with an uncle.\n\nTourgée entered the University of Rochester in 1859. He showed no interest in politics until the university attempted to ban the Wide Awakes, a paramilitary campaign organization affiliated with the Republican Party. Tourgée took on the administration and succeeded in reaching a compromise with the University president. Due to lack of funds, he had to leave the university in 1861, before completing his degree. He taught school to save money in order to return to Rochester.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Civil War in April of the same year, Tourgée enlisted in the 27th New York Volunteer Infantry before completing his collegiate studies. Tourgée was awarded an A.B. degree \"in absentia\" in June 1862, as was a common practice at many universities for students who had enlisted before completing degrees.\n\nFighting in the First Battle of Bull Run, the first major battle of the war, Tourgée was wounded in the spine when he was accidentally struck by a Union gun carriage during retreat. He suffered temporary paralysis and a permanent back problem that plagued him for the rest of his life. Upon recovering sufficiently to resume his military career, he was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 105th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. At the Battle of Perryville, he was again wounded.\n\nOn January 21, 1863, Tourgée was captured near Murfreesboro, Tennessee and was held as a prisoner-of-war in Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia, before his exchange on May 8, 1863. He rejoined Union forces and resumed his duties and fought at the battles of Chickamauga and Chattanooga. Under pressure from the military because of his medical condition, Tourgée resigned his commission on December 6, 1863.\n\nHe returned to Ohio, where he married Emma Doiska Kilbourne, his childhood sweetheart. They had one child\n\nAfter the war, Tourgée studied law with an established firm, in an apprenticeship, and gained entrance to the Ohio bar. The Tourgée couple soon moved to Greensboro, North Carolina, where he could live in a warmer climate better suited to his war injuries. While there, he established himself as a lawyer, farmer, and editor, working for the Republican newspaper, the \"Union Registrar\". In 1866, he attended the Convention of the Southern Loyalists, where he unsuccessfully attempted to push through a resolution for African-American suffrage.\n\nConsidered by locals to be a carpetbagger because he had come from the North, Tourgée participated in several roles during Reconstruction. He drew from this period for later novels that he wrote about the time period. In 1868 he was elected to represent Guilford County at the state constitutional convention, which was dominated by Republicans. He successfully advocated for equal political and civil rights for all citizens; ending property qualifications for jury duty and officeholding; requiring popular election of all state officers, including judges; founding free public education; abolishing the use of whipping posts as punishment for persons convicted of crimes; judicial reform; and uniform taxation. But he learned that the new constitution was the first step to putting these reforms into practice.\n\nTourgée was elected to the 7th District superior court as a judge, serving from 1868 to 1874. During this period he confronted the increasingly violent Ku Klux Klan, which was very powerful in his district and had members who repeatedly threatened his life. During this time, Tourgée was also appointed as one of three commissioners in charge of codifying North Carolina's previously dual law-code system into one. The new codified civil procedures, at first strongly opposed by the state's legal practitioners, proved in time the most flexible, and informal system in the Union. Among his other activities, Tourgée served as a delegate to the 1875 state constitutional convention and ran a losing campaign for Congress in 1878.\n\nAlbion's first literary endeavor was the novel \"Toinette,\" written between 1868 and 1869 while he was living in North Carolina. It was not published until 1874, and then under the pseudonym \"Henry Churton.\" It was renamed \"A Royal Gentleman\" when it was republished in 1881.\n\nFinancial success came after his novel \"A Fool's Errand, by One of the Fools\" was published in late 1879. Based on his experiences of Reconstruction, the novel sold 200,000 copies. Its sequel, \"Bricks Without Straw\" (1880), also was a bestseller. It was unique among contemporary novels by white men about the South, as it presented events from the viewpoints of freedmen, and showed how the promises of freedom were narrowed by postwar violence and discrimination against the freedmen.\n\nIn 1881, Tourgée and his family returned to the North, moving to Mayville, New York, near the Chautauqua Institution in the western part of the state. He made his living as writer and editor of the literary weekly \"The Continent,\" but it failed in 1884.\n\nHe wrote many more novels and essays in the next two decades, many set in the Lake Erie region to which he had relocated. These included \"Button's Inn\" (1887), a novel about early Mormons, who founded their religion in the western part of New York. Called the \"Burned Over District\", this area was a center of religious fervor in the 19th century. One of his books explored social justice from a Christian perspective; this thought-provoking and controversial novel, \"Murvale Eastman: Christian Socialist,\" was published in 1890.\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, the Southern states had become dominated by white Democrats. The legislatures began to pass new constitutions (beginning with Mississippi in 1890) and laws to raise barriers to voter registration to suppress the black Republican vote and to impose legal segregation in public facilities. Louisiana passed an 1890 law intended \"to promote the comfort of passengers\" by requiring all state railway companies \"to provide equal but separate accommodations for the white and colored races, by providing separate coaches or compartments\" on their passenger trains.\n\nIn September 1891 a group of prominent black leaders in New Orleans, made up of mostly men who had been free people of color before the Civil War, organized a \"Citizens' Committee\" to challenge this law on federal constitutional grounds. To assist them in their challenge, this group retained the legal services of \"Judge Tourgée,\" as he was popularly known.\n\nPerhaps considered the nation's most outspoken white Radical on the \"race question\" in the late 1880s and 1890s, Tourgée had called for resistance to the Louisiana law in his widely read newspaper column, \"A Bystander's Notes.\" Written for the \"Chicago Republican\" (later known as the \"Chicago Daily Inter Ocean\" and after 1872 known as the \"Chicago Record-Herald\"), his column was syndicated in many newspapers across the country. Largely as a consequence of this column, \"Judge Tourgée\" had become well known in the black community for his bold denunciations of lynching, segregation, disfranchisement, white supremacy, and scientific racism. He was the first choice of the New Orleans Citizens' Committee's to lead their legal challenge to the new Louisiana segregation law.\n\nAs they developed their challenge, Tourgée played a strategic role, for instance suggesting that a light-skinned, mixed-race African American challenge the law. Dan Desdunes, the son of prominent \"Citizens Committee\" leader Rodolphe Desdunes, was initially selected, but his case was thrown out because he had been a passenger on an interstate train, where the court ruled that state law did not apply. Homer Plessy was selected next. He was arrested after boarding an intrastate train and refusing to move from a white to a \"colored\" car.\n\nTourgée, who was lead attorney for Homer Plessy, first deployed the term \"color blindness\" in his briefs in the \"Plessy\" case. He had used it on several prior occasions on behalf of the struggle for civil rights. Tourgee's first use of \"color blindness\" as a legal metaphor has been documented decades before, while he was serving as a Superior Court judge in North Carolina. In his dissent in \"Plessy\", Justice John Marshall Harlan borrowed the metaphor of \"color blindness\" from Tourgée's legal brief.\n\nIn the wake of an 1892 lynching in Memphis known as the Peoples Grocery lynching, anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells wrote about the case. After the \"Memphis Commercial\" accused her of inciting the incident, she asked Tourgee to represent her in a libel case against the newspaper. Tourgée had largely retired from law (with the exception of his work with the New Orleans \"Citizens' Committee\") and refused. Tourgée recommended that Wells contact his friend, Ferdinand Lee Barnett, and Barnett agreed to take the case.\n\nThis may have been Barnett's introduction to Wells. They married two years later. Barnett came to agree with Tourgée's assessment: that the case did not have a good chance of being won. He said that a black woman would never win such a case heard by an all-white, all-male jury in Memphis, and Wells withdrew her suit.\n\nIn 1897, following Tourgée's involvement in the \"Plessy\" case, President William McKinley appointed him as U.S. consul to France. He sailed to Bordeaux where he was based. About 1900, Tourgée joined the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, an influential Civil War veterans' organization of Union men who had been commissioned officers. He was assigned Companion No. 13949.\n\nTourgée served in France until his death in early 1905. He had been gravely ill for several months, but then appeared to rebound. The recovery was only brief, momentary, however, and he succumbed to acute uremia. The kidney damage was believed related to a Civil War wound.\n\nTourgée's ashes were interred at the Mayville Cemetery, in Mayville, New York. He is commemorated by a 12-foot granite obelisk inscribed thus: \"I pray thee then Write me as one that loves his fellow-man.\"\n\nOn September 5, 1880 Tourgée met his wife in court to settle a financial dispute. Tourgée won, and his wife was issued a $35 fine and sentenced to jail. There is no evidence that she actually served any time, and their marriage did not suffer any lasting harm by this obscure incident. In fact, one biographer of Tourgée, after mentioning that they met as students at Kingsville Academy, made the following observation: \"It was a case of love at first sight, on Tourgee's part at least; for when he first saw her, he confidentially remarked to a friend, 'I'm going to marry that girl,' and after an engagement of five years he did so. The remark he made to her on his death bed, 'Emma, you have been the one perfect wife,' was but little exaggerated, as succeeding events [in his life showed].\"\n\nFiction\n\n\nNonfiction\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2222019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222019", "title": "Battle of Augusta", "text": "Battle of Augusta\n\nThe naval Battle of Augusta, sometimes spelled Agosta and also known as the Battle of Etna, took place on 22 April 1676 during the Franco-Dutch War and was fought between a French fleet of 29 man-of-war, five frigates and eight fireships under Abraham Duquesne, and a Dutch-Spanish fleet of at least 27 warships (17 Dutch, 10 Spanish) besides several frigates and five fireships with a Spanish admiral in overall command and Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral-General Michiel de Ruyter commanding the squadron most involved in the fighting. \n\nThe battle was intense although only a part of each fleet was engaged for much of its duration. It ended when de Ruyter skillfully extracted his outnumbered squadron from being attacked on both sides by superior French numbers, without the loss of any ships, however, he was mortally wounded in the process. The next morning the fleets separated without resuming fighting. Neither side lost a ship, so the result was tactically inconclusive. However, the Dutch casualties were greater than those of the French and, as Dutch-Spanish fleet had hoped to defeat the French fleet and attack Messina, it was a strategic defeat for them.\n\nLouis XIV continued his father and grandfather's policy of rivalry with the Habsburgs and sought to expand France eastwards into Habsburg territory, while the Dutch wished to avoid war with either France or England, and preferred Spanish control of the southern Netherlands to having a common frontier with France. The Treaty of the Pyrenees that ended the Franco-Spanish War in 1659 provided for Louis XIV to marry Maria Theresa, the eldest daughter of Philip IV of Spain, who renounced her right to inherit the Spanish throne to prevent its acquisition by a future French king. The treaty also provided for the payment of a substantial dowry to Louis, which was never paid. \n\nOn the death Philip IV in September 1665, his infant son Charles II of Spain was proclaimed king. He was the child of Philip's second wife Mariana of Austria who became her son's regent. Mariana's nearest male relative, the Emperor Leopold would have a claim to inherit the Spanish Empire through his mother, Maria Anna of Spain, if Charles died childless, so Louis therefore claimed that, since Maria Theresa's dowry had not been paid, her renunciation was invalid. In addition, he referred to an obscure law of the duchies of Brabant and Limburg that prioritised the children of a first marriage in cases of inheritance and finally argued that Maria Theresa's rights to the Spanish throne \"devolved\" to him. The French invasion of the Spanish Netherlands in 1667 was initially very successful, but on 31 July, Peace of Breda ended the Second Anglo-Dutch War and the Dutch began discussions with England and Sweden on creating a diplomatic alliance to protect Spain against France. Although in the subsequent the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, signed by Spain and France on 2 May 1668 allowed Louis XIV to retain several towns in the Spanish Netherlands, he had to return three other cities there and the province of Franche-Comté to Spain. Louis consequently resented this Dutch intervention and used skillful diplomacy and money to detach England and Sweden from their alliance with the Dutch by April 1672.\n\nFrance then invaded the United Netherlands in May 1672 initiating the Franco-Dutch War. After initial successes and the Dutch offer of very favourable peace terms, which Louis refused, the Dutch retreated behind the inundations they had caused by opening river sluices and prepared to resist the French by land and sea. In 1674, the city of Messina in Sicily had revolted against rule by Spain and expelled its Spanish garrison. The city asked for French protection and a small French squadron with a few troops and some food supplies was sent, but it had to withdraw before the year end in the face of a Spanish fleet of 22 ships and numerous galleys. A stronger French force of 20 ships, including nine ships of the line, and a supply convoy managed to break through the Spanish blockade and defeat the more numerous Spanish fleet in a battle off the Lipari Islands on 11 February 1675, capturing one Spanish warship, and it ended the Spanish blockade of Messina and brought considerable food supplies to the city. This battle is sometimes referred to as the First Battle of Stromboli. \n\nThe Spanish then asked for Dutch assistance. Michiel de Ruyter was sent to the Mediterranean with eighteen larger warships and a number of smaller vessels although, because Dutch resources had been strained by the continuing Franco-Dutch War, these ships were not fully manned. After waiting for two months on the Spanish coast for the supplies promised by the Spanish authorities and for a Spanish squadron to join him, de Ruyter sailed for Sicily at the year end and, on 8 January 1676, fought a French fleet of roughly equal numbers but greater firepower in the inconclusive Battle of Stromboli, following which the Dutch lost one ship that sunk after severe battle damage. Later in 1676, de Ruyter was joined by a Spanish squadron of at least ten warships, and the combined fleet, now commanded by the Spanish admiral Don Francisco de la Cerda, wishing to attack Messina, which required defeating the French fleet, decided to attack Augusta to force the French fleet to leave Messina harbour.\n\nThe attack on Augusta had the desired effect of drawing the French fleet out to sea and, on 22 April 1676, the two fleets met in the Bay of Catania north of Augusta. De la Cerda rejected de Ruyter's suggestion of mingling Dutch and Spanish ships, and the Spanish formed the combined fleet's centre squadron, with Dutch squadrons in the van, led by de Ruyter, and rear, under Jan de Haan. Both available sources agree that there were 29 French ships of the line and 13 Dutch warships, not all fit to fight in line. Jenkins mentions ten Spanish warships, Blackmoor 14, besides several Dutch and Spanish frigates, and also five French frigates and eight fireships, and he also suggests that the French fleet was superior in firepower to its opponents. \nBoth fleets sailed in line ahead and were organised into three divisions. The battle was largely an intense fight between the two van squadrons, as de la Cerda kept the centre at long range from its French counterpart, possibly because his ships were short of gunpowder. Some ships in the rear of de Haan's squadron had engaged the tail of Gabret's squadron, but otherwise this squadron kept in line with the Spanish centre for most of the battle. The conduct of the Spanish centre enabled the leading ships of Duquesne's centre to join in the attack on de Ruyter's van squadron and engage his outnumbered ships on both sides. \n\nIn the fierce fighting between the two van divisions, the French ship \"Lys\" was forced out of line and the commander of the French van, Lieutenant-Général Alméras was killed. Towards the end of the day, de Ruyter in \"Eendracht\" attacked Duquesne in \"Saint-Esprit\" with the intention of boarding. but Tourville in \"Sceptre\", aided by \"Saint Michel\" went to their admiral's aid. The Dutch van suffered more severely than its opponents, with three of its ships so badly damaged that they had to be towed to port by Spanish galleys. De Ruyter was able to extract his squadron by his own seamanship and the assistance of de Haan who moved to his support. Some belated assistance near the end of the battle from de la Cerda also helped the Dutch van to disengage from fighting. During the course of the Dutch van's disengagement from fighting, de Ruyter was fatally wounded when a cannonball struck him in the leg, and he died a week later at Syracuse.\n\nThe next morning, the fleets separated without further fighting and combined Dutch-Spanish fleet withdrew to Palermo to repair their battle damage, abandoning any attempt to attack Messina. A month later, on 28 May 1676, the French fleet attacked combined Dutch-Spanish fleet and a squadron of Spanish galleys, all at anchor in Palermo harbour in the naval Battle of Palermo and destroyed two Dutch warships by gunfire seven Spanish warships and two galleys and another Dutch ship by the use of fireships in the enclosed harbour. De Haan, who had assumed command of the Dutch fleet after de Ruyter's death, was killed by a cannonball during the battle. Despite this significant victory, the French withdrew from Messina in 1678 and the Spanish viceroy of Sicily regained control of the city. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFireships:\n\n\n\n10 or 12 ships among them:\n\nThe French navy (Marine Nationale) commemorated the battle of Agosta by naming a conventional submarine (Pennant number S620)\nleading ship of the successful Agosta class, after it.\n\n"}

He is best known for his connections with various locally based pirates. Gentleman pirate Stede Bonnet and the notorious Blackbeard (Edward Teach) surrendered to Governor Eden and received the King's Pardon upon promising to change their ways. Both, however, would eventually return to piracy.\n\nIn 1719 prominent North Carolinian Edward Moseley accused Governor Eden of profiting from Blackbeard's crimes. Moseley was arrested and fined for his accusations. Eden's secretary of the governor's council, Tobias Knight, was implicated when a letter written to Teach was found on the pirate's body at his death and by the fact that cargo taken from a ship captured by Teach was housed in Knight's barn. Knight's letter mentioned the governor's desire to meet with Blackbeard and this was considered sufficient evidence that Eden colluded with the pirates, but no further proof was forthcoming. Eden presented an account of his dealings with Blackbeard to the provincial council, which accepted his pleas of innocence. Nevertheless, Eden's reputation has long been clouded by his connections to Blackbeard.\n\nGovernor Eden died of yellow fever in Bertie County in 1722 at the age of 48.

He was the rosh yeshiva of the Torah Ore yeshiva in Kiryat Mattersdorf and Yeshivas Derech Chaim in Brooklyn. He was a posek (decisor of Jewish law), Gadol HaDor, and one of the last living Torah scholars to have been educated in the yeshivas of prewar Europe. He was often consulted on a range of communal and personal halachic issues. He was one of the rabbinic leaders of Kiryat Mattersdorf, together with Rabbi Yisroel Gans and Rabbi Yitzchok Yechiel Ehrenfeld. He was also a member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of Israel.\n\nChaim Pinchas Scheinberg was born in Ostrov, Poland, the second son of Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Scheinberg and Yuspa (Yosefa) Tamback. He was born in his father's absence, as earlier that year, his father had left his wife and firstborn son Avraham Nosson to go to America to avoid conscription into the Polish army. Unable to work on the Jewish Sabbath, Scheinberg's father wasn't able to send the necessary funds to have his wife and son come to America. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the family lost contact. By 1919, Scheinberg's father had saved enough money to open his own tailor shop and brought his wife and children to America.\n\nAt age 9, Scheinberg moved with his family into a small apartment on the Lower East Side, where his mother gave birth to twins, Shmuel and Chana Baila. After briefly attending public school, Scheinberg enrolled in the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School (RJJ), where he studied until age 14. At that time, Yaakov Yosef Herman, who influenced promising young Jewish men in New York City to advance in their Torah learning, encouraged him to transfer to Rabbi Yehuda Levenberg's Beis Medrash LeRabbonim yeshiva in New Haven, Connecticut, where no secular subjects were taught. Herman also decided that the youth would make a good husband for his third daughter, Bessie, who was then only 12 years old. By the time Scheinberg left the yeshiva at the age of sixteen and a half, he was regarded as a diligent student and had completed the entire Talmud.\n\nAt age 17 Scheinberg progressed to Yeshiva University's Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS). There he studied under Rabbis Shlomo Polachek (known as the \"Meitcheter Ilui\") and Moshe Soloveichik. His learning partners included Rabbis Avigdor Miller, Moshe Bick, Mordechai Gifter, and Nosson Meir Wachtfogel, future leaders of American Torah Jewry.\n\nWhen Scheinberg was 19, Herman suggested the match with his 17-year-old daughter Bessie and the Scheinbergs agreed. Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz, who was a guest at the Herman home at that time, wrote out the engagement contract. At his mother's suggestion, Scheinberg studied for rabbinic ordination in the months before his wedding. He was ordained by Rabbi Moshe Soloveitchik, Rabbi Dr. Bernard Revel, and other rabbis of the yeshiva before his wedding ceremony.\n\nWith the encouragement of his father-in-law, Scheinberg and his new wife spent their first five years of marriage in the town of Mir, Belarus (then Poland). They lived next-door to the yeshiva, where Scheinberg immersed himself in learning while his wife coped with the impoverished lifestyle. There was no running water, the only source of heat was an oven in the center of their apartment, and the unpaved streets were always muddy. Bessie, however, encouraged her husband to grow in learning, and he developed a reputation as one of the yeshiva's most diligent students.\n\nTheirs was one of the few families in Mir; most of the student body was unmarried. Scheinberg was also one of the few American students at the Mir. Herman had already sent his son, Nochum Dovid, and his wife to Mir right after their marriage, and a few years later he sent his daughter Ruchoma and her new husband, Moshe Shain, as well. Scheinberg's younger brother, Shmuel, came to study at the Mir at the age of 14; he managed to escape on one of the last ships leaving Europe before World War II broke out.\n\nThe Scheinbergs' first two daughters, Fruma Rochel and Rivka, were born in Poland. When they were expecting their first child, Scheinberg and his wife visited Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (the Chofetz Chaim), a leader of Ashkenazi Jewry at the time, to receive his blessing. When Scheinberg asked the Chofetz Chaim for an additional blessing since he had come all the way from America to study at the Mir, the Chofetz Chaim quipped, \"Moses came down all the way from heaven to teach the Jews Torah. What’s the big deal about coming from America to Europe?!” Then he blessed them.\n\nWhile in Europe, Scheinberg also learned at the Kaminetz yeshiva and received rabbinic ordination from Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz.\n\nIn 1935 the Scheinbergs returned to America because his American citizenship would have expired after more than five years abroad. Soon after his return, Scheinberg was offered the position of \"mashgiach ruchani\" (spiritual supervisor) of the Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim in Queens founded by Rabbi Dovid Leibowitz. He served in that position for 25 years until leaving to open his own yeshiva, Torah Ore. Scheinberg was known for the warm and caring relationship he developed with his students, and for the kindnesses he and his wife did for neighbors and visitors in their small apartment. Often their daughters slept two to a bed to make room for unexpected guests. During this time, Scheinberg also became the Rav of Congregation Bakash Shalom Anshei Ostrov on the Lower East Side, where he gave Torah lectures to working men.\n\nThe Scheinbergs had two more daughters, Chana and Zelda, and a son, Simcha, in New York. They also raised Rivky Kaufman, one of the seven orphans of Bessie's sister Freida, after the latter's sudden death in 1938.\n\nWith the help and encouragement of his brother, Rabbi Shmuel Scheinberg, and his son-in-law, Rabbi Chaim Dov Altusky (Fruma Rochel's husband), Scheinberg opened the Torah Ore yeshiva in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn in 1960. The yeshiva opened with six students and grew steadily, enrolling many local Sephardi boys who were attracted by Scheinberg's Torah knowledge and warmth. The Scheinbergs treated their students as their own children, raising money to marry them off and even pay their dentist bills.\n\nIn 1963 Bessie's sister Ruchoma visited their father in Israel and toured a planned Haredi housing development in northern Jerusalem called Kiryat Mattersdorf, which was founded by Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld, the Mattersdorfer Rav, who was Ruchoma's neighbor in New York. Upon her return, Ruchoma told Bessie about her desire to buy an apartment there, and Bessie also expressed interest in buying an apartment. Though Scheinberg was skeptical about relocating his family and his American yeshiva to Israel, he made a pilot trip to tour the development and decided that it could work. Ehrenfeld's son, Rabbi Akiva Ehrenfeld, who was his representative in supervising the construction and sale of the apartments, encouraged Scheinberg to relocate his yeshiva to Jerusalem from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn by offering attractive terms for apartments and land for the yeshiva.\n\nThe Scheinbergs, their daughter Fruma Rochel and her family, their son Simcha and his family, and over 20 of Scheinberg's students moved into their new homes in May 1965. Rabbi Asa Wittow, a married student who had learned under Scheinberg since 1960 and who also served as his driver in New York, made aliyah with him and moved into the same apartment building.\n\nScheinberg first established the Torah Ore yeshiva in the Diskin Orphanage building in Jerusalem's Givat Shaul neighborhood. When the Six-Day War broke out in June 1967 and many American tourists headed home, Scheinberg encouraged his students to stay, and none of the American students at Torah Ore left the yeshiva. During the war, Scheinberg showed his complete devotion to his students, giving them encouragement and sleeping together with them in the bomb shelter.\n\nAfter the war, Scheinberg undertook plans to build a permanent home for his yeshiva. Torah Ore moved into its present building in Kiryat Mattersdorf in 1971. As of 2011, the yeshiva enrolls nearly 800 students, including over 500 kollel students.\nBessie was a key partner in her husband's work, supporting him and his students and opening her home to the many people who sought her husband's counsel. They installed a telephone in their bedroom so callers could reach him at any hour. On Simchat Torah, when hundreds of singing and dancing students escorted Scheinberg home from the yeshiva after the services, she would look on from their sixth-floor apartment. When he came upstairs, he would say to her, \"Did you see that? Did you see all those students singing and dancing? That was all because of you. It's all yours, Basha\". Similarly, when she came into the yeshiva, he would give up his seat for her, saying, \"Basha, this seat belongs to you\".\n\nScheinberg became a central address for Americans in Israel seeking guidance for raising children, finding a neighborhood to live in, finding spouses, and coping with medical issues, as well as regular halachic questions. His approbation was sought for many Hebrew- and English-language halacha books for adults and children. The English \"sefer\" \"Rigshei Lev: Women and tefillah – perspectives, laws and customs\" cites his halachic opinions extensively. In 2000, his neighborhood lectures to English-speaking women were compiled in a book titled \"Heart to Heart Talks\", published by ArtScroll.\n\nBessie, who had been in ill health for years, died on 21 October 2009 at the age of 96. They had been married for 79 and a half years.\n\nEven in his later years, Scheinberg continued to fly abroad to fund-raise for his yeshiva. He always took the Talmudic tractate of \"Niddah\" with him and tried to learn all 72 folio-pages during the flight. He was known for never wasting a minute, using the time he spent walking or driving to yeshiva immersed in Torah study. According to his driver, Asa Wittow, he always sat with a Torah book in front of him, even at a wedding, and propped a \"Mishnah Berurah\" on the shelf above his kitchen sink while he washed dishes.\n\nHe was also famous for wearing many layers of tzitzit. At first, he wore about 150 pairs, but later, due to his fragile health, he wore only about 70 pairs. He had said that he wore them on behalf of people who do not fulfill this mitzvah, but Wittow believed that was not the main reason.\n\nScheinberg died in the Shaare Zedek Medical Center of Jerusalem at the age of 101 on 20 March 2012 (27 Adar 5772) after a brief illness. He was suffering from an inflammation in the kidneys and from an infection in his vascular system. An estimated 70,000 people attended his funeral, which began at the Torah Ore yeshiva and proceeded to the Mount of Olives. His only son, Rabbi Simcha Scheinberg, succeeds him as rosh yeshiva of Torah Ore.\n\n\n\n"}

The magazine criticized the game's short length, but admitted that the two-player mode gives the game some longevity.\n\nMost critics also said the graphics overall were solid but failed to actually impress, and found the announcer annoying. \"GamePro\" argued that despite the game's flaws, it is worth checking out because it was thus far the Nintendo 64's only real alternative to the critically panned \"Cruis'n USA\".

Following the war, 150,000 Molossians and other Epirotes were enslaved and transported to the Roman Republic, overwhelmingly in Italy itself. This decision is the only such act of the Roman senate and the largest, single, slave-hunting operation in Roman history. \n\nAccording to Greek mythology, the Molossians were the descendants of Molossus, one of the three sons of Neoptolemus, son of Achilles and Deidamia. Following the sack of Troy, Neoptolemus and his armies settled in Epirus where they joined with the local population. Molossus inherited the kingdom of Epirus after the death of Helenus, son of Priam and Hecuba of Troy, who had married his erstwhile sister-in-law Andromache after Neoptolemus's death. According to some historians, their first king was Phaethon, one of those who came into Epirus with Pelasgus. According to Plutarch, Deucalion and Pyrrha, having set up the worship of Zeus at Dodona, settled there among the Molossians.\n\nAccording to Strabo, the Molossians, along with the Chaonians and Thesprotians, were the most famous among the fourteen tribes of Epirus, who once ruled over the whole region. The Chaonians ruled Epirus at an earlier time, and afterwards the Thesprotians and Molossians controlled the region. The Thesprotians, the Chaonians, and the Molossians were the three principal clusters of Greek tribes that had emerged from Epirus and were the most powerful among all other tribes.\n\nThe Molossians were also renowned for their vicious hounds, which were used by shepherds to guard their flocks. This is where the canine breed Molossoid, native to Greece, received its name. Virgil tells us that in ancient Greece the heavier Molossian dogs were often used by the Greeks and Romans for hunting (\"canis venaticus\") and to watch over the house and livestock (\"canis pastoralis\"). \"Never, with them on guard,\" says Virgil, \"need you fear for your stalls a midnight thief, or onslaught of wolves, or Iberian brigands at your back.\"\n\nStrabo records that the Thesprotians, Molossians and Macedonians referred to old men as \"pelioi\" (πελιοί) and old women as \"peliai\" (πελιαί) (<PIE \"*pel-\", \"grey\"). Cf. Ancient Greek πέλεια \"peleia\", \"pigeon\", so-called because of its dusky grey color. Ancient Greek πελός \"pelos\" meant \"grey\". Their senators were called \"Peligones\" (Πελιγόνες), similar to Macedonian \"Peliganes\" (Πελιγᾶνες).\n\nThe most famed member of the Molossian dynasty was Pyrrhus, who became famous for his Pyrrhic victory over the Romans. According to Plutarch, Pyrrhus was the son of Aeacides of Epirus and a Greek woman from Thessaly named Phthia, the daughter of a war hero in the Lamian War. Pyrrhus was a second cousin of Alexander the Great. In the 4th century BC, they had adopted the term for office of \"prostatai\" (Greek: προστάται) literally meaning \"protectors\" like most Greek tribal states at the time. Other terms for office were \"grammateus\" (Greek: γραμματεύς) meaning \"secretary\", \"demiourgoi\" (Greek: δημιουργοί) literally meaning \"creators\", \"hieromnemones\" (Greek: ἱερομνήμονες) literally meaning \"of the sacred memory\" and \"synarchontes\" (Greek: συνάρχοντες) literally meaning \"co-rulers\". An inscription from the 4th century stated (referring to Alexander I of Epirus):\n\nThe shrine of Dodona was used for the display of public decisions. Despite having a monarchy, the Molossians sent princes to Athens to learn of democracy, and they did not consider certain aspects of democracy incompatible with their form of government.\n\nOlympias, the mother of Alexander the Great, was a member of this celebrated sovereign house.\n\nIn 385 BC, the Illyrians, aided by Dionysius of Syracuse, attacked the Molossians, attempting to place the exile Alcetas on the throne. Dionysius planned to control all the Ionian Sea. Sparta intervened and expelled the Illyrians who were led by Bardyllis. Even with the aid of 2,000 Greek hoplites and 500 suits of Greek armour, the Illyrians were defeated by the Spartans (led by Agesilaus) but not before ravaging the region and killing 15,000 Molossians.\n\nIn another Illyrian attack in 360 BC, the Molossian king Arymbas (or Arybbas) evacuated his non-combatant population to Aetolia and let the Illyrians loot freely. The stratagem worked, and the Molossians fell upon the Illyrians, who were encumbered with booty, and defeated them.\n\nThe Molossians briefly sided with the anti-Roman Macedonian-Illyrian pact in the Third Macedonian War. After the Roman victory, a total of 150,000 Epirotes, mostly Molossians, were enslaved and sent to Italy, by decision of the Roman Senate. In the following years, Epirote slaves in Italy outnumbered slaves of other origins and the majority of slave marriages were between Epirotes. In historiography, the decision of the senate has been the subject of much debate, as the two main anti-Roman powers of the time in that region, the Macedonians and the Illyrians, suffered few consequences in contrast to the Molossians in terms of punishment. Howard Hayes Scullard had proposed the most recognized theory in the past. He connected the measures taken by the Romans to Charops of Epirus, member of a rival tribe the Chaonians - a Roman ally - who in order to gain command of the region, pushed for the extermination of the Molossians. This interpretation is based on the negative assessment of Charops, already in ancient sources, as Polybius calls him \"the most savage and degenerate of all men\". The modern interpretation of the events, focuses more on the structural reasons which led to this decision by the Romans rather than the personal politics of regional actors. The plague of 174 BC caused a great reduction of available labor in Italy, which was supplied almost exclusively by slave labor. In the following years, slave-hunting became a central feature of Roman campaigns. The Roman senate, which represented the landowning elite, specifically targeted the Molossians because of the proximity of their territory to Brundisium and Taranto would require a much lower cost of transportation. In comparison, at least 65,000 Sardinians and many other tribes were enslaved in the same year.\n\n\n\n"}

He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1926 to 1930. He was also a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1914 to 1920 and from 1932 to 1936, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken.\n\nMcPherson was born in Worth County, Missouri, and arrived in Canada with his family in 1879. He was educated at Portage la Prairie, and worked as a barrister. He was called to the bar in 1904, and became a bench member of the Manitoba Bar Association in 1915. In 1916, he was named King's Counsel. In 1904, McPherson married Winnifred Mabel Finn.\n\nHe first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1910 provincial election, as a Liberal in the Portage la Prairie constituency. He was defeated, losing to Conservative cabinet minister Hugh Armstrong by 199 votes. McPherson ran again in the 1914 election, and defeated Armstrong by ten votes.\n\nThe Conservative administration of Rodmond Roblin was forced to resign amid scandal in 1915. The house was dissolved, and another election called. McPherson was re-elected, defeating Conservative candidate Fawcett Taylor by 258 votes. For the next five years, he served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's administration.\n\nMcPherson was defeated in the 1920 election, losing to Fawcett Taylor by 287 votes. Taylor's public profile had increased between 1915 and 1920, and he was chosen as leader of the Manitoba Conservative Party two years later.\n\nMcPherson did not contest the 1922 provincial election, but instead turned his attention to federal politics. He was selected by the Liberal Party of Canada to run against Conservative Prime Minister Arthur Meighen in the federal election of 1926. He was successful, upsetting Meighen by 428 votes in the federal riding of Portage la Prairie. The Liberal Party won the election, and McPherson served for four years as a backbench supporter of William Lyon Mackenzie King's government.\n\nThe Liberals were defeated in the 1930 provincial election, and McPherson lost his seat to Conservative candidate William Herbert Burns by 142 votes. After this loss, he turned his attention to provincial politics again.\n\nIn 1922, the United Farmers of Manitoba unexpectedly won a majority of seats in the Manitoba parliament and formed government as the Progressive Party. With Mackenzie King's support, the Manitoba Liberal Party formed an electoral alliance with the Progressive Party in 1932. Although he did not yet have a seat in the legislature, McPherson was appointed to John Bracken's cabinet on May 27, 1932 as Provincial Treasurer.\n\nIn the 1932 provincial election, McPherson made the questionable decision of challenging Conservative leader Fawcett Taylor again in Portage la Prairie. Although Bracken's \"Liberal-Progressives\" were re-elected with a majority government, McPherson went down to a resounding defeat. He had to wait until July 16, 1932 to run in a deferred election in the sprawling northern constituency of Rupertsland, and even here his election was not certain. He was forced to face another pro-government candidate, incumbent Progressive Herbert Beresford, and won by only 97 votes.\n\nNotwithstanding his difficulties in the election, McPherson continued to serve as Provincial Treasurer for the parliament that followed. He was also named Municipal Commissioner on May 10, 1935. He did not seek re-election in 1936. Some federal Liberals hoped that McPherson would replace Bracken as premier, but this did not come to pass.\n\nAfter leaving politics, McPherson served as Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench of Manitoba from 1937 to 1944 and then was named Manitoba Court of Appeal in 1944. He held the latter position until his death of a heart attack while attending his son's wedding anniversary in Kenora, Ontario in 1954.\n"}

It was also the start of the distribution collaboration with CMC International in North America and certain territories.\n\nIt is the second, and last, album to feature the four-man lineup of Lemmy, Phil \"Zööm\" Campbell, Würzel, and Mikkey Dee, as Würzel left the band after the recording of this album.\n\nMotörhead reunited with producer Howard Benson for \"Sacrifice\". \"This is a very good album\", vocalist and bassist Lemmy wrote in the sleeve notes, \"Put it in your system and your girlfriend's clothes fall off..\" Lemmy views \"Sacrifice\" as one of his favourite records the band has made, despite the difficulties involved, which he explained as:\n\nIn the documentary \"The Guts and the Glory\", all three band members express regret over Würzel's departure, but insist it was inevitable, with drummer Mikkey Dee commenting:\n\nCampbell, who joined Motörhead with Würzel in 1984, recalls: \n\nIn the same film, Lemmy reveals that Würzel began to suspect that he was being ripped off financially:\nThe band went into the studio with some great songs, Lemmy recalls, although \"Sex & Death\" was written in ten minutes on the last day of recording, \"In Another Time\" was altered beyond all recognition and there were three sets of lyrics for \"Make 'Em Blind.\" Dee and Campbell didn't realise that \"Out of the Sun\" was only two and half verses and had rehearsed it as such but Lemmy added another section when nobody else was around, with him playing bass and Jamie, his guitar roadie, playing guitar. He then gave the others a tape of it. According to Lemmy, when Würzel played it in the rental car he nearly drove off the road. \"Make 'Em Blind\" came from improvisation, with Campbell recording the solo in one take, falling over the couch and onto his back laughing uproariously. Lemmy states that the album contains more nonsense than most of the previous album – the lyrics don't mean anything you can really get a hold of – but that they convey the mood, especially the title track and \"Out of the Sun.\" \"Dog Face Boy\" is about Campbell, but Lemmy decided that only after having written it, likening the line \"Poor boy out your mind again/Jet plane outside looking for another friend\" to Campbell's habit of quickly hitting town and looking for fun after getting off the plane.\n\nIt was not a success nor did it make much impact on the album charts, as with the previous album, it was largely ignored by the general public. With a new label it was released correctly, compared to \"Bastards\", and the title track has stayed in the live set for some time, but there hasn't been much written about this album that is noteworthy.\n\nThe title track was used in the movie \"Tromeo and Juliet\", a film in which Lemmy appears.\n\nThe American version of the album cover had Würzel airbrushed out but, according to Joel McIver's book \"Overkill: The Untold Story of Motörhead\", Lemmy insists that this was the record label's idea, not theirs: \nRather than hiring a new guitar player, the band decided to revert to a three-piece.\n\nJoe Petagno, the sleeve artist, was well known for inserting references to genitalia in his drawings, and this one was no exception. He commented:\n\nAllMusic states that:\n\nIn 2011 Motörhead biographer Joel McIver wrote that \"Sacrifice\":\nPer the \"Sacrifice\" liner notes.\n\n\n"}

Nitta's ally Uryū Tamotsu was forced back to the fortress of Somayama in March 1337, and Nitta Yoshisada joined him there soon afterwards, hoping to lead a counterstrike to lift the siege. This failed, and the occupants of the besieged castle, having run out of food and water, were forced to eat horseflesh to survive. In accordance with Buddhist belief, this was close to the worst disgrace one could face; eating horseflesh was believed to break one's karma, forcing them to be reborn in the next life as an animal or something worse.\n\nNevertheless, the defenders held out for twenty days longer, and on April 7, Kō no Moroyasu, commander of the besieging army, broke through the walls and took the fortress.

In 2002, he reached #1 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Chart with his single \"Caught Up\". The song was also featured prominently in an episode of the Showtime television series Queer as Folk.\n\nIn 2006, his released his single, \"Work It Out\" featuring Dawn Tallman under his Catch 22 Recordings label. \"Work It Out\" was re-released on House Trained Records in the UK, and after appearing on MTV, was play-listed on BBC Radio 1. In 2008, \"Changes\" was released, which was a collaboration with David Tort and DJ Ruff, and the single stayed on the Beatport digital top three downloads for two months.\n\nIn 2010, DJ Disciple collaborated with top Spanish Producer Javi Mula on Sexy Lady.\n\"'Sexy Lady\" video received The Best 'Dance ClipVideo' in Spain. In December 2011, DJ Disciple collaborated with Jan & Solo on \"U Know My Steez\". The song became a successful product tool to promote the Pioneer Corporation product 'Steez'. In Feb 2012, Disciple collaborated with Albert Neve on \"\"Romper Room\"\" featuring Dru Hepkins. The track was immediately picked up by Joachim Garraud for a remix and was supported heavily by Chuckie.\n\nHe was born to William and Julia Banks. DJ Disciple (David Banks) is the youngest of four brothers. Sherman, Stanley, Larry and Leighton. His brother Stanley Banks is the bass player for George Benson. His other brother Larry Banks plays at The Church Of The Open Door in Brooklyn.\n\nGrandmaster Flowers lived in his building, hailing from Farragut Projects. He lived across the street from Kenny Carpenter, a DJ at Studio 54, and the family were great friends with Strafe (who made the hit record \"Set It Off\") and Rusty Taylor, Shannon's bass player.\n\nDavid attended The Greater Refuge Temple, The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ Ministry with Bishop William L. Bonner and served as the church's drummer.  He left Refuge Temple and joined The Church Of The Open Door after his mother accepted the lord as her savior under Rev. Dr. Mark VC Taylor.\n\nDavid Banks graduated from Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School in 1984. He attended Baruch College and was introduced to House music from his friend Jerome Anderson and Ralph Davis.\n\nAfter a brief internship, he worked at WNYE (FM) as a radio host and mixer in 1987. Originally a Gospel DJ, he named and kept the name DJ Disciple as a reminder that \"<nowiki>'only what you do for Christ shall last'</nowiki>\".\n\nDisciple quickly earned a dedicated following from his on-air work at college stations WBMB and WHCS and his first professional DJ gig took place at the legendary Studio 54. In the 90's, Disciple found himself hosting “The Best Kept Secret”, a mix show on WNYE (FM), where he exclusively debuted a litany of now-classic underground tracks. His show was instrumental in exposing new dance artists to mainstream radio. Artists included Roger Sanchez, Kerri Chandler, Pal Joey, Todd Edwards, 95 North, and Smack Productions. 'The Best Kept Secret' was the first show to expose female DJ's playing dance music on the radio and one of the very few shows where you could hear unreleased material from future artists not available for months. Finding success in the college circuit, and his own 'Best Kept Secret' show on the radio, Disciple became a great fit for the nightclub scene. It was DJ Camacho who gave him his first introduction to New York Underground House Music. His first trial was playing at The World with Bobby Konders back in 1989. After his performance he was made resident DJ from the outfit Wild Pitch. From there he was interviewed by Richard Vasquez and Joey Illinois at David Mancuso's space The Loft. He landed a bi-weekly residency with Larry Levan and then DJ Basil at the venue with the party then called The Choice in Lower Manhattan.\n\nHe was hired by Monte Collins and Steve Miller from Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. The duo Slick & Smooth Productions helped solidify Disciple's following when he was doing their Hunter College parties and also caught the attention of fellow Sigmas Leonard Gabbidon and Stan Dennis. Gabbidon hired Disciple to close shows for Liz Torres, Jomanda, Main Source, Special Ed, Brand Nubian and Run DMC at the Syracuse Greekfest located at the Manley Fieldhouse in 1989-1991. Stan Dennis had Disciple play at the Jones Beach Greekfest while other Sigmas worked with Disciple at St John's University and The City College parties before the Stampede incident occurred. \n\nIn 1990 Disciple worked at New Jersey's Club 280 as their Friday night resident. The venue was near Zanzibar home of Dj Tony Humphries. Club 280 had the reputation of bringing the New York Sound to New Jersey. As the night grew popular Disciple was then asked to play at Zanzibar since Tony had left. Being instrumental in breaking Aly-Us 'Follow Me' both on radio and in New Jersey, Disciple took on his next task to play Zanzibar. It was a task met with failure and a lesson learned.\n\n'The Best Kept Secret' (91.5 FM) was so popular that Disciple later on was asked to be a regular mixer for Japan's Bay FM radio show and his recordings of the show were being sold in London's Camden Market.\n\nIn 1992 it was Roger Sanchez who introduced Disciple to traveling by connecting him to be booked in San Francisco. Simultaneously he was introduced by David Camacho to John Paul Firman. John Firman, interested in representing Disciple for the UK set him up to play Lakota in Bristol and a year later Ministry of Sound. In both cases Disciple's reputation grew. Disciple debuted at Ministry of Sound playing in the smaller room for Bert Bevans birthday party in 1993. It was there that Disciple broke 'Show Me Love' by Robin S. to the London audience. From that moment on Ministry Of Sound had Disciple play the main room of its venue from 1993 - 2001 at least twice a year.\n\nIn 1993 Disciple debuted his first single on Muzik Pushers. Home to Bobby Davis S.U.R.E record pool. 'When The Music Stop' one of the singles from the EP became a club hit in Italy. Record label D:vision Records snapped it up giving Disciple even more exposure. Disciple then made his debut in at Angels Of Love in Naples, Italy the same year. Knowing he was on to something Disciple continued to produce but worked with Eddie Perez in 1994. Disciple produced The Street Experience EP and the single from it 'On The Dancefloor' hit the UK singles charts at #67.\n\nThat year Disciple played fifty dates in the UK alone. Venues included Cream (Liverpool), Ministry of Sound, (London) (two times), Hard Times (Leeds) (two times), Lakota, (Bristol) (two times), Garage City, London (three times), Notting Hill Carnival, The Middlesbrough Empire, The Zap (Brighton) and others. From 1995-1997 Disciple played at Southport Weekender and Owner Alex Lowe had Disciple play To The Manor Born three times a year from 1994 until 2004. Keith 'KCC' Franklin had Disciple debut at his KCC and the Rocking Crew Notting Hill Carnival event. Disciple had been a regular guest playing from 1994 until 2010. Venues such as Hard Times were responsible for exposing Disciple to Northern cub culture. When Hard Times came to London it was hailed one of the biggest events of the year. The event was called Down-N-Out In London at Bagleys. Hard Times formed Hard Times The Label. One of the first releases had Disciple remixing Robert Owens and Michael Watford on the release 'Come Together'. Disciple's profile had grown so big that he made it into the top 100 DJ's for DJ Magazine in 1995, one year after the magazine did his first featured interview.\n\nWhile JP Firman helped solidify Disciple's career in the UK, it was Bobby & Steve that helped propel it even further. The Zoo Experience was a radio show on Kiss FM London headed by the two brothers promoting soulful House as well as the UK's most established night, Garage City. From 1993 until its close in 2003 Disciple played at least twice a year. With a reputation for getting music way before its release date, Disciple was the first to break both 'Deep Inside' and 'Beautiful People' (both singles from Barbara Tucker) on the show. It was from that point that Disciple became a regular guest mixer, spinning a one-hour mix at least three times a year. Anytime Disciple came to London The Zoo Experience always had venues waiting to have him booked. Whether it be Fabric, Turnmills or Legends, Bobby & Steve considered Disciple a part of them and pushed him as far as exposure went. His releases of \"Keep On Moving\", \"Don't Shut Me Out\" (Interstate) and his remix of Plutonic's \"I'm Addicted\" were influential records on the UK Garage scene. \n\nDisciple would regularly travel to Canada to play with Peter, Tyrone and Shams for the 'Thundergroove Sundays' at Oz one of the first venues to bring in the big-name house DJs before places like Industry and The Guvernment existed. While living in London, Disciple worked with Grant Nelson. The two decided to do a swap. Grant Nelson engineered two tracks for Disciple's EP on Todd Terry's Freeze record label and in turn Disciple would do vocals for his debut on Swing City records. 'To The Bone' was the first single that Disciple's radio voice was actually used on a record. Todd Terry, a fan of sampling decided to release 'Latin Love' (Rip Off Mix) from the Vinyl Factory EP. The record bought Disciple a huge amount of exposure but the record had to be recalled because of the controversial sample.\n\n\"Steal Away\", one of the tracks off of the e.p.was used by Erick Morillo for his Ministry Of Sound Compilation and the second track 'Burning' was licensed to Deconstructed records in the UK. After releasing The Fixed EP on Ultra Music and remixing for various artists like Plutonic ('Addicted'/ Bold) Disciple decided to work with internationally acclaimed artists. The first hit for the label was in 1998. 'Put Your Hands Up' by the Black & White Brothers. The record sold four million copies worldwide since its original signing.\"Put Your Hands Up\" by the Black & White Brothers helped expose the label Catch 22 Worldwide it was licensed to Happy Music (France) (21), Edel (Germany), United (Benelux), Planet Works (Greece), Energy (Italy), Blanco Y Negro (Spain), Hotter (Argentina), and Central Station (Australia). This record was known the world over, but very few recognized that Catch 22 signed this record and the buzz originally started when Roger S. and others got their hands on the Catch 22 copy in Miami Winter Music Conference of 1998.\n\nAfter the overground success of the Black & White Brothers, Disciple decided to give his friend DJ Dove an opportunity or a Catch 22 Release. Inaya Day had a string of hits including Boris Dlugosh's hit record \"Keep On Movin”. The two worked out perfectly under the guidance of Frankie Feliciano and Junior Sanchez\". Slip-N-Slide Records picked the track up for the UK. 1997 saw Disciple debut in Montreal for the first time spinning with Deep Dish at Sona. His set was so impressive that the after hour club that held 3,000 people had him play twice a year from 1998 - 2004. Disciple loved the club so much that he made his EP 'Sona/Industry'a trademark of his sets for the record label Ultra Music.

Green Jr. (born October 4, 1963) is an American retired professional basketball player. Nicknamed \"Iron Man\", he holds a National Basketball Association (NBA) record for most consecutive regular season games played with 1,192. Green played for the Los Angeles Lakers, Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks and Miami Heat. He found his most success with the Lakers, with whom he won three championships in 1987, 1988 and 2000, and was named an NBA All-Star in 1990. Green was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, attending Benson Polytechnic High School and Oregon State University. He was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nGreen was born in Portland, Oregon. He was given the initials \"A. C.\" like his father A. C. Green Sr. The initials stand for his father's mother, Amanda, and his father's father, Chester. Green converted to Christianity in the town of Hermiston, Oregon, while he was still in high school. He never missed a class in his educational career.\n\nGreen attended Oregon State University, where he finished second in school history in rebounding and fourth in scoring. He was an All-Pac-10 selection as a sophomore, and as a junior he ranked fourth in the nation in field goal percentage at .657. As a senior, he averaged 19.1 points and 9.2 rebounds and was named to the All-America Third Team. He was inducted into the Pac-12 Basketball Hall of Honor during the 2012 Pac-12 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, March 10, 2012.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers, fresh from winning an NBA championship, selected Green in the first round as the 23rd overall pick in the 1985 NBA draft.\n\nGreen led the Lakers in rebounding for six of his eight years on the team. Led by Magic Johnson, James Worthy and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles captured back-to-back titles in 1987 and 1988, Green's second and third years with the squad. In the two campaigns combined, he averaged 11.1 points and 8.2 rebounds while shooting better than .500 from the field. Green also reached the NBA Finals with Los Angeles in 1989 and 1991. Green was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team in 1988–89, was voted a starter on the 1990 Western Conference All-Star Team and finished fourth in the league in field goal percentage in 1992–93 at .537.\n\nGreen left the Lakers in 1993 to sign with the Phoenix Suns as a free agent. The Suns had just reached the NBA Finals, losing in six games to the Chicago Bulls, and they viewed Green as the missing piece to their championship puzzle. Green posted a career-high average of 14.7 points per game in 1993–94, but the Suns were eliminated in the conference semifinals. In 1994–95 he again contributed double-figure scoring and solid rebounding for the Suns, but his playing time and contributions dipped in 1995–96; though he remained the team's second-leading rebounder. His streak of consecutive games played almost ended during a game with the New York Knicks when J. R. Reid intentionally elbowed him in the face. Green lost two teeth and suffered a head injury but was still able to continue on with his streak by wearing a protective mask and only playing a couple of minutes a game for a few weeks.\n\nGreen was traded two months into the 1996–97 season to the Dallas Mavericks in the deal that brought Jason Kidd to Phoenix. He brought reliable rebounding to the rebuilding Mavs. He tied Shawn Bradley for the team lead in rebounding in 1997–98 with 8.1 rpg, but his season highlight came on November 20 against Golden State when he played in his 907th consecutive game, becoming the league's all-time iron man, surpassing Randy Smith's mark of 906 consecutive games played.\n\nGreen played in his 1,000th consecutive game on March 13, 1999, against Vancouver, and finished the 1998–99 season at 1,028 in a row and counting. After 14 seasons in the league, Green had missed only three games, all during the 1986–87 season (his second in the league).\n\nGreen returned to the Los Angeles Lakers for the 1999–2000 season where he won his last NBA championship with the Lakers by defeating the resilient Sacramento Kings in five games in the first round, his former team the Phoenix Suns also in five games in the second round and finally the talented Portland Trail Blazers in the Western Conference Finals en route to defeating the Indiana Pacers in six games to win the series and the 2000 NBA Championship, Green's third championship.\n\nGreen played his final NBA season with the Miami Heat where he was reunited with Pat Riley. The Heat made the playoffs, where they were swept 3–0 by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nGreen's 1192 consecutive games played streak began on November 19, 1986, when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the San Antonio Spurs in San Antonio. The streak ended with the last game of his career on April 18, 2001, when the Miami Heat defeated the Orlando Magic in Orlando. In addition to this streak, he also managed to miss only three games throughout his entire playing career, all of which came during his second season in the NBA.\n\nGreen is a devout Christian. He is known for proclaiming that he began and ended his NBA career as a virgin bachelor. During his rookie year, his teammates sent a woman to tempt him to compromise his commitment. Green responded by calmly quoting scripture. He established the A.C. Green Youth Foundation in 1989, which operates youth camps to promote abstinence until marriage. In 2000, he wore a green bear on his head while on the bench during basketball games to promote his foundation.\n\nGreen suffered from singultus, or chronic hiccups, during his NBA career, the hiccups only stopping when Green was running or working out. Reportedly, Green never slept more than two hours at a time due to the condition. He has since recovered. In 2011, he was awarded the Bobby Jones Award by Athletes in Action for character, leadership, and faith in the world of basketball, in the home and the community. Green's humanitarian efforts earned him a spot in the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame.\n\nGreen married his wife Veronique in 2002.\n\nIn 2015, Green was a judge for the 2015 Boost Mobile NBA D-League Slam Dunk Contest.\n\nIn 2017, Green signed to be the Director of Sports for the United Basketball Alliance of India.\n\n\n\n"}

He is the protagonist of an eponymous satirical comics series which appeared in left-wing publications to sympathize with the common worker. Decades later \"Mr. Block\" gained historical importance for being a predecessor to underground comix.\n\nMr. Block, who has no first name, was created on November 7, 1912 by Ernest Riebe, a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Block appeared that day in the Spokane newspaper \"Industrial Worker\", smoking a cigar and wearing a checkered suit with top hat. Subsequently, Mr. Block lost the fancy clothes but often kept a hat, ten sizes too small, perched on one corner of his wooden blockhead.\n\n\"Mr. Block is legion,\" wrote Walker C. Smith in 1913. \"He is representative of that host of slaves who think in terms of their masters. Mr. Block owns nothing, yet he speaks from the standpoint of the millionaire; he is patriotic without patrimony; he is a law-abiding outlaw... [who] licks the hand that smites him and kisses the boot that kicks him... the personification of all that a worker should not be.\"\n\nJoe Hill wrote \"Mr. Block\" to the tune of \"It Looks to Me Like a Big Time Tonight\".

He was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1921 to 1925, served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1927 to 1936, and was a cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken.\n\nHoey was born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Ireland, and came to Canada in 1909. He was educated at Wesley College and Manitoba College in Winnipeg and became a pioneer worker in the farmer's movement. He served as provincial director of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM) in 1918, and worked as the UFM's field secretary from 1919 to 1921.\n\nHe was elected to the House of Commons in Canada's federal election of 1921 as a Progressive candidate, defeating Liberal candidate Thomas Molloy by 1,397 votes in the riding of Springfield. He served on the opposition benches of parliament for the next four years, and did not seek re-election in 1925. He returned to farm organization after leaving the House of Commons in 1925, taking part in the organization of the Western Wheat Pools.\n\nThe United Farmers of Manitoba unexpectedly won a government majority in the 1922 provincial election, and formed government as the Progressive Party of Manitoba. Hoey was asked to become Premier of Manitoba but declined. John Bracken was then selected in his place.\n\nOn April 28, 1927, Hoey joined Bracken's provincial government as Minister of Education. He did not hold a seat in the legislature at the time but was a prominent campaigner for the Progressive Party in the 1927 provincial election, and defeated independent incumbent Donald A. Ross by 710 votes in the St. Clements constituency. He was easily returned in the 1932 election and served as Minister of Education until the end of his nine-year tenure in the legislature. He also served as acting Attorney General from February 22 to May 18, 1929.\n\nIn 1932, Hoey played a prominent role in negotiations between Manitoba's Progressive and Liberal parties, which resulted in a Liberal-Progressive electoral alliance. The alliance eventually became a permanent partnership, and government members became known as \"Liberal-Progressives.\"\n\nHoey was defeated in the 1936 provincial election, losing to Independent Labour Party candidate Herbert Sulkers by 665 votes.\n\nAfter his electoral defeat in 1936, he became Superintendent of Welfare and Training in the Indian Affairs Branch of the federal Department of Mines and Resources. He served in that position until March 1945, when he became Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, a position that he held until 1948.\n\nHoey was appointed to a seat on the Northwest Territories Council in 1946, and served to 1951.\n\n"}

Some of the labels in this group include MCA Nashville Records, Mercury Nashville Records, Lost Highway Records, Capitol Records Nashville and EMI Records Nashville. UMG Nashville not only handles these imprints, but also manages the country music catalogues of record labels Universal Music and predecessor companies acquired over the years including ABC Records, Decca Records, Dot Records, DreamWorks Records, Kapp Records, MGM Records and Polydor Records.\n\nMCA Nashville started out as the country music division of Decca Records in 1945, founded by Paul Cohen in New York. In 1947, Cohen hired Owen Bradley as his assistant working in Nashville. The country music division moved to Nashville in 1955 as much of the country music recording business was locating there. Bradley succeeded Cohen as head of Decca's Nashville division in 1958 and developed Decca into a country music powerhouse. Decca Nashville was renamed MCA Nashville in 1973.\n\nIn 1979, MCA Nashville absorbed the country music roster (including Roy Clark, Barbara Mandrell and The Oak Ridge Boys) and back catalogue of ABC Records including the Dot Records catalogue. In the early 1980s, MCA Nashville signed Reba McEntire and George Strait, two of the greatest selling artists of all time and the mega stars on the record label.\n\nIn the 1990s MCA Nashville briefly revived the Decca label for country music releases, but it was shut down after Universal Music absorbed PolyGram and chose to reserve the Decca name for classical music releases. While Decca resumed issuing country music in February 2008, the current Decca country music department has no connection with UMG Nashville. However, MCA Nashville continues to reissue past country releases from Decca, as well as those on the Kapp label.\n\nWith the absorption of MCA Records into Geffen Records in 2003, MCA Nashville, apart from UMG's operations in the Philippines, is now the only unit of UMG to still use the MCA name.\n\nThe still active Mercury Records was formed in Chicago in 1945 issuing recordings in a variety of genres including country music. The Nashville office of Mercury began as a joint venture between Mercury and \"Pappy\" Daily's established country music record label Starday Records in January 1957. In July 1958, the Mercury/Starday joint venture was dissolved and Starday record producer Shelby Singleton stayed on with Mercury in Nashville, becoming head of Mercury's Nashville office by 1961. Singleton left Mercury in 1966 to form his own company which bought Sun Records in 1969.\n\nIn 1997, PolyGram, which owned Mercury, consolidated all its Nashville operations under the Mercury name.\n\nWhen PolyGram was purchased by Universal Music Group in 1998, the resulting record label consolidations left Mercury under The Island Def Jam Music Group umbrella making Mercury in the USA dormant until recently, but still active internationally. The consolidations in Nashville which created UMG Nashville kept the Mercury Nashville imprint active. \n\nReissues of country music recordings first issued on the MGM, Polydor, and other former PolyGram labels bear the Mercury Nashville imprint (with some exceptions). \n\nCapitol Records Nashville is a major United States-based record label located in Nashville Tennessee operating as part of the Capitol Music Group. Capitol Nashville was formerly known as Liberty Records from 1991 until 1995 when it was changed back to Capitol. In 1993 Liberty opened a sister label, Patriot Records, but it was closed in 1995. In 1999 EMI launched Virgin Records Nashville but by 2001 Capitol absorbed the short-lived label. Capitol Nashville remained a stand-alone label until 2010 when it launched EMI Nashville. Capitol Nashville is also home to several successful comedy artists who remain on its roster today. On March 23, 2011, Alan Jackson signed with Capitol's EMI Nashville division in conjunction with his own ACR Records label. In late 2012 Capitol Records Nashville became part of the Universal Music Group after a merger between EMI and UMG.\n\nEMI Records Nashville was formed in 2010 and served as a sister label to Capitol Records Nashville. Its flagship artist was Troy Olsen. Other artists signed to EMI include Eric Church and Alan Jackson (in a shared agreement with his own ACR Records). Universal Music Group acquired EMI in 2012. EMI is currently a part of UMG along with sister label Capitol Records Nashville.\nLost Highway Records was formed by Luke Lewis in 2000. Lost Highway Records operates as a country music label, based out of Nashville. The label also issues music by alternative rock and alternative country artists such as Morrissey and Ryan Adams. The company's name was inspired by a Leon Payne song. Today the label operates as an imprint of Mercury Records, a division of The Island Def Jam Music Group. Lost Highway has distributed the soundtracks for \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\", \"Deadwood\", and \"Open Season\" by Paul Westerberg. They have also acted as distributor for albums from Johnny Cash and Hank Williams.\n\nFormed in April 2017 Buena Vista Records is a partnership between Disney Music Group and Universal Music Group Nashville.\n"}

One such league, the Campeonato Paulista, which started in 1902, is the oldest football competition in Brazil. Due to their long tradition, they are highly regarded.\n\nHistorically, because of economical or geographical issues, the long distances between important cities of the country made the Brazilian people develop a strong competitive culture within the states. So, each Brazilian state has its own state championship. As of 2009, most of the state championships start in January and conclude in early May (23 dates assigned to matches).\n\nDue to these competitions, some matches between rival clubs of the same state or city have a similar or bigger importance than an interstate match between two important clubs. These local matches are called \"clássicos\" (\"classics\", or \"derbies\"). Some examples are Flamengo-Vasco in Rio de Janeiro; Corinthians-Palmeiras in São Paulo; Atlético Mineiro-Cruzeiro in Minas Gerais; Náutico-Sport in Pernambuco; Grêmio-Internacional in Rio Grande do Sul; Atlético Paranaense-Coritiba in Paraná; Bahia-Vitória in Bahia.\n\nThe state champions and, in some states, the runners-up, are automatically qualified to play in the following year's Copa do Brasil. Also, the best placed clubs of each state which are not competing in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, Série B or Série C qualify to the same year's Série D.

The collection of paintings, sculpture, drawings, prints, rare books, and manuscripts reflects the development of British art and culture from the Elizabethan period onward.\n\nThe Center was established by a gift from Paul Mellon (Yale College Class of 1929) of his British art collection to Yale in 1966, together with an endowment for operations of the Center, and funds for a building to house the works of art. The building was designed by Louis I. Kahn and constructed at the corner of York and Chapel Streets in New Haven, across the street from one of Kahn's earliest buildings, the Yale University Art Gallery, built in 1953. The Yale Center for British Art was completed after Kahn's death in 1974, and opened to the public on April 15, 1977. The exterior is made of matte steel and reflective glass; the interior is made of travertine marble, white oak, and Belgian linen. Kahn succeeded in creating intimate galleries where one can view objects in diffused natural light. He wanted to allow in as much daylight as possible, with artificial illumination used only on dark days or in the evening. The building's design, materials, and sky-lit rooms combine to provide an environment for the works of art that is simple and dignified.\n\nThe Center is affiliated with the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London, which awards grants and fellowships, publishes academic titles, and sponsors Yale's first credit-granting undergraduate study abroad program, Yale-in-London.\n\nThe collection consists of nearly 2,000 paintings and 200 sculptures, with an emphasis on the period between William Hogarth's birth (1697) to J. M. W. Turner's death (1851). Other artists represented include Thomas Gainsborough, George Stubbs, Joseph Wright, John Constable, Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Lawrence, Robert Polhill Bevan, Stanley Spencer, Barbara Hepworth, and Ben Nicholson.\n\nThe collection also has works by artists from Europe and North America who lived and worked in Britain. These include Hans Holbein, Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Canaletto, Johann Zoffany, John Singleton Copley, Benjamin West, and James McNeill Whistler.\n\nSome areas of emphasis of the collection are small group portraits, known as \"conversation pieces\", including those by Hogarth, Gainsborough, Zoffany and Arthur Devis; landscape paintings by Gainsborough, Richard Wilson, Constable, Richard Parkes Bonington and Turner; and British sporting and animal paintings, featuring George Stubbs, John Wootton, Benjamin Marshall, and Alfred Munnings. Other genres include marine paintings, represented by Samuel Scott and Charles Brooking; London cityscapes; travel art from India, scenes of Shakespearean plays, and portraits of actors.\n\nSculptors represented include Louis-Francois Roubiliac, Joseph Nollekens, Francis Chantrey, Jacob Epstein, and Henry Moore.\n\nThe collection of 20,000 drawings and watercolors and 31,000 prints features British sporting art and figure drawings. It includes works by Hogarth, Paul Sandby, Thomas Rowlandson, William Blake, John Constable, Samuel Palmer, Richard Parkes Bonington, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, Walter Sickert, Duncan Grant, Paul Nash, Edward Burra, Stanley Spencer, Augustus John, Gwen John, and the Pre-Raphaelites.\n\nThe Center's collection of rare books and manuscripts comprises 35,000 volumes, including maps, atlases, sporting books, and archival material of British artists. It also has some 1,300 leaves originating in illustrated incunabula. The collection also includes a complete set of William Morris's Kelmscott Press publications as well as a growing collection of contemporary artists’ books. The core of the collection of illustrated books is the material amassed by Major J. R. Abbey‚ one of the first collectors of British color-plate books, and includes more than 2‚000 volumes describing British life‚ customs‚ scenery‚ and travel during the period 1770–1860. The Center's collection also contains a significant number of early maps and atlases.\n\nThe four-floor Center offers a year-round schedule of exhibitions and educational programs, including films, concerts, lectures, tours, symposia, and family programs. It also provides numerous opportunities for scholarly research, including residential fellowships. Academic resources of the Center include the reference library (40,000 volumes) and photo archive, conservation laboratories, and a study room for examining works on paper from the collection.\n\nThe Center is open to the public free of charge six days a week, and is a member of the North American Reciprocal Museums program.\n\n"}

A left full back or midfielder, he is the head coach of Rangers W.F.C. in the Scottish Women's Premier League. \n\nVignal played in the top division in five countries – England, France, Spain, Scotland and Greece – and in the second tier in a sixth, Germany, though never played in more than 30 league games for any club. At international level, he represented France at under-20 level in the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship and has also been capped at under-21 level.\n\nBorn in Montpellier, Vignal began his career at his home-town club, Montpellier. He soon established a reputation as a promising young player, and was signed by Liverpool in September 2000 for £500,000. He immediately impressed in his first reserve team outings and made his first team debut against Rotherham United in the FA Cup. He went on to make a further six appearances during the 2000–01 season.\n\nVignal returned for the following season having featured in the World Youth Championship with the France Under-18 squad, and staked his claim for the left-back spot with some impressive performances at the start of the 2001–02 season. However, he found it hard to displace the reliable and experienced John Arne Riise. He went on to make nine appearances that season.\n\nHe made just four appearances during the first half of the 2002–03 season and was loaned to Bastia for the remainder of the campaign in mid-January 2003.\n\nDuring the 2003–04 campaign Vignal was again loaned out to Rennes for the first half of the season, and to Espanyol for the latter half.\n\nVignal had a season in Scotland at Rangers as the club regained the Scottish Premier League title, playing 42 games and picking up a Scottish League Cup winner's medal as well as the league title.\n\nAt the end of the 2004–05 season Vignal's Liverpool contract expired, and with him available on a free transfer Rangers wanted him to sign a permanent contract with them; however, he failed to agree terms, instead opting to move to Portsmouth. He was then released from Portsmouth after failing to impress Harry Redknapp on his return in the 2005–06 season.\n\nVignal then moved to Lens on a free transfer and was loaned out to FC Kaiserslautern for the second half of the season in January 2007.\n\nAfter a trial with the club, Vignal joined Southampton on a season-long loan on 27 July 2007. He scored his first goal for Southampton with a free kick in a 2–0 win over Leicester City in the FA Cup, and his first league goal came from a penalty against Scunthorpe United while playing with a broken arm. He scored another penalty in the 2–2 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers before being sent off for an off-the-ball incident. However, he later won an appeal against the card. He scored four goals from 23 appearances in the 2007–08 season.\n\nDuring the summer of 2009, Vignal had a trial with Queens Park Rangers which did not bring the offer of a contract.\n\nVignal then played in a friendly match against Sporting Gijón as part of a trial with Birmingham City, newly promoted to the Premier League. After producing what manager Alex McLeish described as a \"strong performance\", Vignal signed a one-year contract with the club, with an option for a further year, subject to medical examination. Injury disrupted his season, which combined with the form of Liam Ridgewell at left-back restricted the player to just nine first-team appearances. The club chose not to take up the option of a second year.\n\nIn July 2010, Vignal had trials with Sheffield United and Cardiff City. In September 2010, he joined Atromitos. He then left the Athens club in December 2010.\n\nOn 12 September 2012, Vignal signed a contract with Scottish Premier League club Dundee United until January 2013, but left in November without having made a first-team appearance. He returned to France, where he signed for CFA (fourth-tier) club AS Béziers ahead of the 2013–14 season.\n\nAfter a period working with Rangers as a coach for their youth academy teams, in July 2019 Vignal was appointed the head coach of the club's senior Women's team with the incumbent Amy McDonald moving to a role as the overall women's section manager.\n\nLiverpool\n\nRangers\n\nLens\n\nFrance\n\n"}

Where no such overlap is given, in other words where there is no rational agreement possibility, the inverse notion of NOPA (no possible agreement) applies. Where there is a ZOPA, an agreement within the zone is rational for both sides. Outside the zone no amount of negotiation should yield an agreement.\n\nAn understanding of the ZOPA is critical for a successful negotiation, but the negotiants must first know their BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement), or \"walk away positions\". To determine whether there is a ZOPA both parties must explore each other's interests and values. This should be done early in the negotiation and be adjusted as more information is learned. Essential is also the ZOPA’s size. Where a broad ZOPA is given, the parties might use strategies and tactics to influence the distribution within the ZOPA. Where the parties have a small ZOPA, the difficulty lies in finding agreeable terms.\n\nTo determine whether there is a positive bargaining zone each party must understand their bottom line or worst case price. For example, Paul is selling his car and refuses to sell it for less than $5,000 (his worst case price). Sarah is interested and negotiates with Paul. If she offers him anything higher than $5,000 there is a positive bargaining zone, if she is unwilling to pay more than $4,500 there is a negative bargaining zone.\n\nA ZOPA exists if there is an overlap between each party's reservation price (bottom line). A negative bargaining zone is when there is no overlap. With a negative bargaining zone both parties may (and should) walk away.\n\nA negative bargaining zone may be overcome by \"enlarging the pie\". In integrative negotiations when dealing with a variety of issues and interests, parties that combine interests to create value reach a far more rewarding agreement. Behind every position there are usually more common interests than conflicting ones.\n\nIn the example above, Sarah is unwilling to pay more than $4,500 and Paul won't accept anything less than $5,000. However, Sarah may be willing throw in some skis she received as a gift but never used. Paul, who was going to use some of the car money to buy some skis, agrees. Paul accepted less than his bottom line because value was added to the negotiation. Both parties \"win\".\n\nA negotiator should always start considering both parties' ZOPA at the earliest stage of his or her preparations and constantly refine and adjust these figures as the process proceeds. For every interest there often exists several possible solutions that could satisfy it.\n\n\n"}

His Breton language name is Neven Hénaff. He was a chemical engineer by training. After the war he lived in Ireland.\n\nHe was born in 1908 in Nantes and was brought up in Ploudalmézeau, Finistère. He later entered the École Centrale. He became closely linked to Guillaume Berthou, a fellow chemist and Breton separatist. Contrary to myth, he denied any involvement with the secret society \"Kentoc'h Mervel\" (Sooner Death), formed by Berthou in 1929, though Berthou had approached him to join. Instead, in 1930 he set up with Hervé Helloco the paramilitary organisation, Gwenn ha du ('white and black'). It was named after the colours of the flag of Brittany, designed by Morvan Marchal in 1925. Lainé published an article summarizing its creed under the title \"Nos deux bases, Irlande et Prusse\" (Our two models: Ireland and Prussia), referring to the revolutionary zeal of the IRA and the authoritarian discipline of Prussian militarism. The gang perpetrated several bombings. Lainé claimed he made the first bomb in his bedroom from nitroglycerin in a condensed milk carton with a detonator supplied by a forestry worker. \n\nKristian Hamon claims it was not he but fellow nationalist André Geffroy who placed the bomb which blew up Jean Boucher's statue depicting the \"Unity of Brittany and France\" in Rennes. It happened on the morning of 7 August 1932. According to Hamon, Geffroy placed the bomb on the monument, which portrayed the duchess Anne of Brittany kneeling before King Charles VIII of France. \n\nTwo people were crossing the Town Hall Square at the time but they subsequently refrained from saying what they had seen, despite the offer of a reward. The explosion tore the mass of bronze from its niche and smashed it on the ground. All the windows within a hundred metres were shattered. Parts of the sculpture have been preserved.\n\nIn 1936 Lainé created the Kadervenn (Combat tool), a paramilitary unit based on the IRA model, comprising a dozen members engaged in military manoeuvres. This organisation instructed new recruits and in 1938 participated in exercises in the Landes de Lanvaux, a belt of heath and woodland north of Vannes. The following year he spent a period in Germany where he organised the delivery of a batch of arms, which was shipped on board the ship \"Gwalarn\". However the ship beached at Locquirec in the night of the 8th and 9 August 1939. The arms were recovered and stored in the abbey at Boquen.\n\nBefore and during the Second World War, Lainé sided with the Germans. He favoured aggressive tactics and sought to establish a distinct Breton army to work with the Nazis against the French state. (\"We will continue the tradition of those who, throughout the centuries, have struggled, arms in hand, to affirm our national rights.\") With Yann Goulet he participated in the creation of the \"Bagadou Stourm\" (Stormtroopers). He also set up a unit of volunteers that he controlled personally, called the \"Service Spécial\" (or \"Lu Brezhon\" in Breton). This paramilitary unit was in charge of the maintenance of order within the Breton National Party. \n\nIn 1941, Lainé helped to oust Olier Mordrel from the leadership of the Breton National Party when it became evident that the Germans objected to his strident anti-Vichy position. There followed a split between the \"Bagadou Stourm\" and the \"Service Spécial\", as Lainé became increasingly close to the Nazis. On the 11 September 1943, at Rennes, he and Colonel Hartmut Pulmer (chief of the Sicherheitsdienst at Rennes) signed the foundation convention of a new unit to be called \"Bezen Kadoudal\", named after the Breton rebel Georges Cadoudal. In 1944 it took the new name \"Bezen Perrot\" (Perrot Militia), the name referring to Abbé Perrot, a parish priest and ardent defender of the Breton language who had recently been assassinated by the French Resistance. His group brought together around a hundred people; his deputy was Alan Heusaff. In 1943, the organisation functioned as an auxiliary police force for the Nazis fighting against the Resistance. The soldiers of Bezen Perrot enrolled in the \"Waffen-SS\", wearing SS field-uniforms. In May 1944, he symbolically founded a new Breton national party on extreme nationalist lines. At the Liberation of France, these collaborationist activities brought opprobrium on the whole of the Breton movement.\n\nHunted out of Brittany by the defeat of the Nazis, the last fighters of this unit found themselves at Tübingen, from which many stayed in Germany under false identities, assisted by Leo Weisgerber. Sentenced to death \"in absentia\", Lainé fled to Ireland, where he lived until his death in 1983 in various locations around Ireland, notably County Dublin and Oranmore in County Galway.\n\nOlier Mordrel, co-founder of the Breton independence party, wrote that he \"was a strange man. He had become the prophet of a Celtic religion made for himself, where Nordic racism was married to the Nietzschian will to power, and not without flirting with an air of romantic druidism.\"\n\n"}

In 1979 he moved to Northwestern. \nWeber's general area of research is game theory, with a primary focus on the effects of private information in competitive settings. Much of his research has been centered on the theory and practice of competitive bidding and auction design. His 1982 paper, \"A Theory of Auctions and Competitive Bidding\", co-authored with Paul Milgrom, is considered a seminal work in the field. In that paper the authors analyzed auctions with interdependent values, and introduced the linkage principle. He served as an external consultant on a 1985 project leading to revisions in the procedures used to auction petroleum extraction leases on the U.S. outer continental shelf, and he co-organized (with representatives of the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury) the 1992 public forum which led to changes in the way the Treasury auctions its debt issues. Since 1993, he has represented private clients during both the rule-making and bidding phases of the FCC's sale of licenses of spectrum for the provision of personal communications services.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Weber proposed an alternative to the traditional \"plurality rule\" for elections involving more than two candidates. This alternative, which he named \"approval voting\", a multi-candidate binary rating system of social choice, has generated a substantial body of research, has been adopted by a number of professional organizations, and has been used in several public elections. His later work in this area includes \"A Theory of Voting Equilibria\", co-authored with Roger Myerson. For a summary see \"Approval Voting\".\n\nWeber has also conducted research on negotiation and arbitration. Among his activities have been preparation of a research survey for the American Arbitration Association, and development of classroom materials for the National Institute for Dispute Resolution. He is a founding member of the Center for Research on Dispute Resolution at Northwestern University, and has served on the editorial board of the International Journal of Game Theory. In 1990 he was designated the outstanding professor of the year by the students in Kellogg's Managers' Program, and in 1998 he received the Sidney J. Levy Teaching Award.

In November 2018, the World Anti Doping Agency imposed a lifetime ban on Bruyneel for his role in a doping scandal that saw Lance Armstrong stripped of his seven Tour de France titles.\n\nBorn in Izegem, Belgium, Bruyneel was a successful professional cyclist. Early wins included the 1990 Tour de l'Avenir, the 1991 Rund um den Henninger Turm, the 1992 Grand Prix des Nations and Coppa Placci, and stage 6 (Evreux > Amiens) and finishing 7th at the 1993 Tour de France. His stage win set the record for fastest stage at 49.417 km/h, since then only broken by two cyclists.\n\nHis greatest successes as a pro cyclist came in 1995. At the 1995 Tour de France, he won stage 7, which began in Charleroi and ended in Liège, Belgium, and took the yellow jersey in his home country. Bruyneel launched an escape and was joined by eventual winner Miguel Indurain. The Spaniard took the lead and rode the stage as a time-trial to gain time on his main rivals, with Bruyneel latched onto his wheel, barely able to follow the tempo. He then beat Indurain in the end sprint to win the stage. Bruyneel admitted he felt somewhat uneasy about how he had won. However, the win into Liège afforded him a chance meeting with the King of Belgium during the prize presentations. That same year, Bruyneel achieved his only podium finish in a Grand Tour when he finished 3rd at the 1995 Vuelta a España and won the \"Aalst criterium\".\n\nIn the 1996 Tour de France, he missed a curve when descending a hill in stage 7 (Chambéry > Les Arcs), and disappeared into a ravine. The moment was captured by a camera team that was driving right behind the group of descenders. After some time, Bruyneel could be seen climbing out of the ravine and getting back onto his bike to continue the stage, apparently unscathed.\n\nFollowing his retirement from cycling in 1998 at age 34, Bruyneel accepted the position of managing director of the U.S. Postal Service cycling team, whose star, Lance Armstrong, had finished fourth in the 1998 Vuelta a España, but whose team, in Armstrong's words, was \"the Bad News Bears, a mismatch of bikes, cars, clothing, equipment,\" with a total budget of only $3 million. Bruyneel's team promptly won eight of the next nine editions of the Tour de France, with Armstrong winning seven straight prior to his retirement in 2005 and then Alberto Contador winning in 2007 with Levi Leipheimer finishing third. However, Discovery Channel, which had taken over as the sponsor of the team in 2005, decided to withdraw in 2007 in the wake of the sport's extensive doping scandals, and the team disbanded. At that point, Bruyneel's teams had won ten Grand Tour championships in nine years (8 Tours de France, 1 Giro d'Italia (Savoldelli, 2005) and 1 Vuelta a España (Heras, 2003). Seven of these victories have since been nullified with the disqualification of Lance Armstrong from 1999 to 2005 from the Tour de France by USADA with ratification from the UCI\n\nAt the time, Bruyneel announced his retirement and his plans to write a book. Bruyneel's book, \"We Might As Well Win\", was published by Houghton Mifflin on 4 June 2008. Also, on 29 May 2008, Bruyneel joined the Board of Directors of World Bicycle Relief. But his retirement did not materialize.\n\nIn October 2007, after negotiations with the Kazakh government, Bruyneel was signed to take over control of the embattled team, which had been kicked out of the 2007 Tour de France for doping violations and was in shambles over its doping connections. He brought Discovery's Contador and Leipheimer with him for the 2008 season. Although the team was banned from the Tour de France for its past doping history, Contador won both the 2008 Giro d'Italia and the 2008 Vuelta a España, making Contador the youngest rider to win all three Grand Tour championships. Additionally, Leipheimer finished second at the Vuelta.\n\nContador's victory in the Tour de France meant that Bruyneel had won four of the last six Grand Tours that his teams entered, and thirteen Grand Tour championships in eleven years (seven of these victories have since been nullified with the disqualification of Lance Armstrong from 1999 to 2005 from the Tour de France by USADA with ratification from the UCI). In 2010, Team RadioShack was formed with sponsorship from Radio Shack and Trek Bicycle Corporation. Bruyneel confirmed his departure from Astana at the end of the 2009 season to join Team RadioShack.\n\nAs of May 2010, he was under investigation by the Belgian cycling federation, after being accused by Floyd Landis of involvement in systematic doping while director sportif of Lance Armstrong's US Postal team.\n\nOn 28 June 2012, Bruyneel was accused by USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency), although he is not an American citizen. Allegations include the assumption that Bruyneel was part of a long-running doping conspiracy, including the use of banned methods to augment the performance of the cycling teams that he directed. As a result of the allegations, Bruyneel declined to appear at the 2012 Tour de France, where he had been expected to direct the RadioShack-Nissan team.\n\nWhile some accused in this case, such as Lance Armstrong and Michele Ferrari, did not seek to formally contest the charges via arbitration, Bruyneel asked for an arbitration hearing.\n\nIn October 2012, while still waiting for his hearing, Bruyneel left his position as managing director of , shortly after documents from the USADA case were released to the public. The termination was by mutual agreement with owners of Leopard SA. The day after Armstrong's acknowledgment that he doped during all of his Tours, Bruyneel announced that he would be in Brussels as soon as possible to speak to the Belgian national cycling organization and cooperate with its investigation.\n\nIn November 2013, Armstrong settled a lawsuit with Acceptance Insurance Company (AIC). AIC had sought to recover $3 million it had paid Armstrong as bonuses for winning the Tour de France from 1999 to 2001. The suit was settled for an undisclosed sum the day before Armstrong was scheduled to give an oral deposition under oath. In a written deposition for the lawsuit, Armstrong stated under oath that, \"Johan Bruyneel participated in or assisted with Armstrong's use of PEDs, and knew of that use through their conversations and acts.\"\n\nIn April 2014, Bruyneel was given a ten-year ban by USADA, who noted that “the evidence establishes conclusively that Mr. Bruyneel was at the apex of a conspiracy to commit widespread doping on the USPS and Discovery Channel teams spanning many years and many riders.\" Said Bruyneel about the ban, \"I do not dispute that there are certain elements of my career that I wish had been different. However, a very small minority of us has been used as scapegoats for an entire generation.\"\n\nIn November 2018, the World Anti Doping Agency successfully increased his ten-year ban to a lifetime ban.[2]\n\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n\n\n\n"}

Candidates supported by the government were called \"Liberal-Progressives\", and Mackay ran under this banner in Springfield. Despite Barclay's background with the Progressive Party, he ran against Mackay as an independent \"Farmer-Labour\" candidate, and won election by 652 votes. He was injured in an automobile accident on the night of the vote, but recovered to take his seat in the legislature.\n\nOnce elected, Barclay appears to have become a government supporter again.

These dates conventionally delimit the year in which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. However, this season got off to a very early start, with a Category 2 hurricane forming on March 6, making it the third earliest hurricane on record to form in the Atlantic Basin after Hurricane One in 1938 and Hurricane Alex in 2016. It is the only known Atlantic tropical cyclone to exist in the month of March. Another hurricane formed and existed during the last week of May, and became the earliest hurricane to hit the U.S. in recorded history. Cape Hatteras was affected by two hurricanes and one tropical storm this year. Overall, this season was near average with 10 tropical storms forming.\n\nThe storm was the first and only North Atlantic tropical cyclone observed to form in March, since records began. The system was initially observed by a ship at 12:00 UTC on March 6 while located about northeast of Barbuda. Tracking in an unusual south-southwest direction, the storm intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Shortly before reaching the United States Virgin Islands early on March 8, the hurricane intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , which was observed in Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis. Once in the Caribbean Sea on March 8, the system slowly began to weaken, losing hurricane status the following morning. The storm was last noted about north of Blanquilla Island late on March 9.\n\nOn Saint Barthélemy, some buildings were damaged. Winds in Saint Martin toppled peasant tents and damaged crops. The city of Basseterre on Saint Kitts reported winds at and rainfall reaching . The storm beached 24 small crafts and boats and severely damaged crops.\n\nA tropical depression developed on May 24 at 12:00 UTC about 50 mi (80 km) southwest of Cockburn Town, Turks and Caicos Islands. Moving northwestward, the depression struck the Turks and Caicos Islands. Around 06:00 UTC on May 26, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. By late on May 27, the storm curved northeastward. The cyclone strengthened into a hurricane by 06:00 UTC the following day. It made landfall west of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) around 21:00 UTC on May 29. A barometric pressure of was observed at Hatteras, the lowest in relation to the storm. A few hours later, the cyclone reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean. Early on May 30, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm. Accelerating northeastward, the storm struck eastern Long Island, New York, with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) late on May 30, just prior to making landfall near Noank, Connecticut, at the same intensity around 23:00 UTC. The storm became extratropical over southern Maine early on May 31. The remnants continued northeastward until dissipating over the northern portion of the state several hours later.\n\nIn North Carolina, the storm produced sustained winds up to at Morehead City. Winds disrupted communications with towns along the Outer Banks. Rough seas generated by the storm in New Jersey swept away a significant amount of sand, especially at Long Branch. An oceanfront street in the city was closed after waves washed out approximately of the road. In Rhode Island, storm surge and abnormally high tides wrecked many boats at Narragansett Bay. One person died of exhaustion during the storm and another suffered a serious injury when a tree fell on a car. Damage in the state was estimated in the thousands of dollars. \n\nIt was one of only three May hurricanes during the 20th century in the Atlantic Basin; the others were Able in 1951 and Alma in 1970. It marked the earliest date for the season's second hurricane to form in any Atlantic season on record, and it was the earliest hurricane to hit the U.S. in recorded history.\n\nThis storm formed north of The Bahamas on July 24. The storm then made a loop north of the Bahamas and became a hurricane shortly after. The storm grazed North Carolina and moved into the Atlantic. On July 31, it made landfall. The storm dissipated on August 3. The hurricane washed away cottages and boardwalks in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina.\n\nA tropical depression developed just offshore Sabine Pass, Texas, around 00:00 UTC on July 29. Moving southeastward, the depression intensified into a tropical storm about 12 hours later. Early on July 30, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Eventually, it recurved to the north-northwest and headed toward Louisiana. At 22:00 UTC on July 31, the cyclone made landfall on Marsh Island, Louisiana, at the same intensity. The storm weakened to a tropical depression early on August 2, around the time it curved northeastward. By late on August 3, the system dissipated over northern Mississippi.\n\nIt turned around and made landfall in Louisiana, dropping at Franklin, Louisiana, between July 26 and August 2.\n\nA ship detected a tropical storm about 230 mi (370 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, at 12:00 UTC on August 30. The storm moved westward, until turning northeastward late on August 31. At 00:00 UTC on September 1, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Eight hours later, it made landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, at the same intensity. Shortly thereafter, the storm reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean. The system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 18:00 UTC on September 2, while located about 135 mi (215 km) southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The storm brought strong winds to portions of North Carolina and Virginia.\n\nThe sixth and strongest storm of the season was a Category 3 hurricane in mid-September that moved across the central Bahamas and turned out to sea.\n\nThe storm killed at least 19 people in the Turks Islands.\n\nA ship first observed this tropical storm about 245 mi (395 km) north-northwest of Telchac Puerto, Yucatán, at 12:00 UTC on September 16. The storm intensified gradually while moving northwestward, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) at 00:00 UTC on September 18. However, the cyclone soon quickly weakened, falling to tropical depression intensity about 18 hours later. It then dissipated about 70 mi (115 km) south-southwest of the Texas–Louisiana state line.\n\n1908's eighth storm was a Category 2 hurricane in late September and early October that crossed the Lesser Antilles, moved over Hispaniola and eastern Cuba, and crossed over the Bahamas before turning northeast. It then made a loop and became extratropical on October 7. It caused extensive damage to the Greater Antilles.\n\nA ship indicated that a tropical depression developed about 160 mi (255 km) north-northeast of Nombre de Dios, Colón, on October 14 at 12:00 UTC. Moving westward, the depression became a tropical storm early the following day. The storm later curved to the west-northwest and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane around 12:00 UTC on October 16. About 24 hours later, it became a Category 2 hurricane. Late on October 17, the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Early the next day, it made landfall near the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region–South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region line in Nicaragua at the same intensity.\n\nIn mid-October, the ninth storm of the season, a Category 2 hurricane, struck Nicaragua. Because it moved slowly, very heavy rainfall fell in its path, although there is no known damage or deaths from the hurricane itself.\n\nThis storm formed off of the Carolinas on October 19. It stayed out in the Atlantic until it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and made landfall in South Carolina shortly before dissipating.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2222324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222324", "title": "Visual gag", "text": "Visual gag\n\nIn comedy, a visual gag or sight gag is anything which conveys its humour visually, often without words being used at all. The gag may involve a physical impossibility or an unexpected occurrence. The humor is caused by alternative interpretations of the goings-on. Visual gags are used in magic, plays, and acting on television or movies.\n\nThe most common type of visual gag is based on multiple interpretations of a series of events. This type is used in the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock film \"The 39 Steps\". Lead actor Robert Donat was kidnapping actress Madeleine Carroll and they were handcuffed. When they checked into an inn, the innkeeper assumed that they were passionate lovers because of the handcuffs. The film used dialogue that could be interpreted both ways.\n\nAnother visual gag is a switched image, often at the beginning of a film. A subsequent view of the scene shows something not viewed before. Switched movement may be the gag, such as Charlie Chaplin in \"The Pawnshop\". Chaplin fights with his coworker and punches at him once. Their boss walks in mid-swing and Chaplin changes the motion to act like he was dropping to his knees to scrub the floor. \n\nNoel Carroll established the most influential taxonomy of sight gags, breaking down the varieties into six types, two of which are enumerated below.\n\nMutual Interference: The audience is fully aware of the on-screen situation, but a character comically misunderstands\n\nMimed Metaphor: A variety of virtual simile an object may be treated as if it is a different object or be used in an unconventional way, such as acting like a doughnut is a barbell or using a tuba as an umbrella holder.\n\nThere are numerous examples in cinema history of directors who based most of the humor in their films on visual gags, even to the point of using no or minimal dialogue. Visual gags began in live theater. The first known use of a visual gag in a film was in the Lumière brothers' 1895 short, \"L'Arroseur Arrosé\" (\"The Waterer Watered\"), in which a gardener watering his plants becomes the subject of a boy's prank. An early pioneer in visual gags was Georges Méliès. The filmmaker experimented with techniques in the then-new film media creating techniques to trick viewers.\n\nVaudeville actors often used gags in their routines. A classic vaudeville visual gag was for two actors to mirror each other's actions around a prop. Visual gags were continued into silent films and are considered a hallmark of the genre. In silent films, the actors in the mirror bit performed in silence with no music playing. Comedians including Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and the Marx Brothers often used visual humour because the technology used to record voices in film (and play it back in a synchronized presentation) did not yet exist. Often the differences between people are part of the comic duos, especially thin and fat actors are used such as Abbott and Costello and Laurel and Hardy.\n\n\"The New York Times\" cites the fourth \"Gilligan's Island\" episode, \"Goodnight, Sweet Skipper\", as a classic American sight gag. The castaways were trying to contact civilization with a radio. In the episode, Skipper can recall only how he converted the radio into a transmitter in World War II when he was sleepwalking. After Skipper was unsuccessful, Gilligan got it to work by pounding on the radio; he used it to briefly contact a pilot flying overhead. Gilligan retrieved Skipper and demonstrated how he pounded on the radio, causing the guts of the radio to fall out. Their rescue was foiled.\n\n"}

It has been suggested that the last evolutive act of the island took place only 27,000 years ago.\n\nThe island was first populated as long ago as 17th century BC, as some archaeological evidence from this period has been found. Roman ceramic fragments, dating from many centuries later, can be found on the eastern coast of the island.\n\nThe modern name of \"Alicudi\" is a corruption of the island's Ancient Greek name of \"Ereikousa\", derived from the plant known as erica, more commonly known as heather, which still grows on the island’s slopes. For many centuries, Alicudi was the target of frequent incursions by pirates. Consequently, the island’s population was forced to find shelter in small houses constructed on high terraces and also meant that simple agriculture and cultivation of the peach were the foundations of the modest island economy.\n\nIn more recent times, the island became known for its alleged witches and sorcerers whose explanation has come to be attributed to ergotism in local grain-based foodstuff which was consumed regardless due to scarcity.\n\nToday there are around 120 inhabitants who mostly live off fishing, or the small agriculture of the island. There is only one restaurant on the island and the menu depends greatly on what fish the local fishermen have caught, or what food supplies the hydrofoil brings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2222352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222352", "title": "Philippine dynasty", "text": "Philippine dynasty\n\nThe Philippine Dynasty, also known as the House of Habsburg in Portugal, was the third royal house of Portugal. It was named after the three Spanish kings who ruled Portugal between 1581 and 1640 in a dynastic union of the two crowns. The three kings, all named Philip (; , ), were from the House of Habsburg.\n\nThe history of Portugal from the dynastic crisis in 1580 to the House of Braganza monarchs was a period of transition. At its beginning, the Portuguese Empire spice trade was near its height. It continued to enjoy widespread influence after Vasco da Gama had finally reached the East by sailing around Africa in 1497–1498. Vasco da Gama's achievement completed the exploratory efforts inaugurated by Henry the Navigator, and opened an oceanic route for the profitable spice trade into Europe that bypassed the Middle East.\n\nThroughout the 17th century, the increasing predations and beleaguering of Portuguese trading posts in the East by the Dutch, English and French, and their rapidly growing intrusion into the Atlantic slave trade undermined Portugal's near monopoly on the lucrative oceanic spice and slave trades. This sent the Portuguese spice trade into a long decline. To a lesser extent, the diversion of wealth from Portugal by the Habsburg monarchy to help support the Catholic side of the Thirty Years' War also created strains within the union, although Portugal did benefit from Spanish military power in helping to retain Brazil and in disrupting Dutch trade. These events, and those that occurred at the end of the House of Aviz and the period of the Iberian Union, led Portugal to a state of dependency on its colonies, first India and then Brazil.\n\nDue to complexity in the management of government affairs, the Spanish Monarch established auxiliary bodies called Councils (\"Consejos\"), dedicated to providing advice toward resolution of problems. The Councils needed a permanent seat, and so King Philip II of Spain established in 1562 the permanent capital in Madrid, seat of the Royal Court and of the administrative staff. During a brief period (1601–1606), the whole administrative staff held court in Valladolid.\n\nAdministrative correspondence originated from different Councils and was delivered by each Council Secretary to Madrid for the attention of the Crown. The king would later assemble the secretaries to request the Council's opinion. The meetings of the Councils took place in the royal palace, and they did not count on the presence of the king habitually. In this polisynodial system stood out for its importance, the \"Consejo de Estado\" (Council of State).\n\nRelating to the particular government of the kingdom of Portugal itself. During the union of the kingdom of Portugal to the Spanish monarchy, the Spanish Habsburgs on the whole respected the pledges made at Thomar in 1581 to allow considerable Portuguese autonomy and to respected the territories of its empire. Public offices were reserved for Portuguese subjects at home and overseas. The king was represented at Lisbon sometimes by a governor and sometimes by a viceroy. So, Spain left the administration of Portugal and its empire largely to the Portuguese themselves, under general supervision from Madrid channeled through a viceroy in Lisbon. Important matters, however, were referred to Madrid, where they came before the Council of Portugal. In the kingdom of Portugal, the polisynodial system is reinforced:\n\n\nNevertheless, the political conjuncture needed urgent reactions, and in this context a system of meetings appeared for specific issues, as the Junta for the reform of the Council of Portugal (1606–1607, 1610), the Junta for the classification of the debts to the treasury (since 1627) or the Juntas for the organization of the navies of succor of Brazil (since 1637)...\n\nThe union of the two crowns deprived Portugal of a separate foreign policy, and Spain's enemies became Portugal's. England had been an ally of Portugal since the Treaty of Windsor in 1386. War between Spain and England led to a deterioration of the relations with Portugal's oldest ally, and the loss of Hormuz. English help provided by Elizabeth I of England in a rebellion against the kings assured the survival of the alliance. War with the Dutch led to invasions of many countries in Asia, including Ceylon (today's Sri Lanka), and commercial interests in Japan, Africa (Mina), and South America. Even though the Portuguese were unable to capture the entire island of Ceylon, they were able to keep the coastal regions of Ceylon under their control for a considerable time. Brazil was partially conquered by both France and the Seventeen Provinces.\n\nIn the 17th century, taking advantage of this period of Portuguese weakness, many Portuguese territories in Brazil were occupied by the Dutch who gained access to the sugarcane plantations. John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen was appointed as the governor of the Dutch possessions in Brazil in 1637 by the Dutch West India Company. He landed at Recife, the port of Pernambuco, in January 1637. By a series of successful expeditions, he gradually extended the Dutch possessions from Sergipe on the south to São Luís de Maranhão in the north. He likewise conquered the Portuguese possessions of Elmina Castle, Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would reestablish its authority over the lost territories of the Portuguese Empire. The Dutch intrusion into Brazil was long-lasting and troublesome for Portugal. The Seventeen Provinces captured a large portion of the Brazilian coast including Bahia (and its capital Salvador), Pernambuco (and its capital Recife), Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará, and Sergipe, while Dutch privateers sacked Portuguese ships in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The large area of Bahia and its city, the strategically important Salvador, was recovered quickly by a powerful Iberian military expedition in 1625. This laid the foundations for the recovery of remaining Dutch controlled areas. The other smaller, less developed areas were recovered in stages and relieved of Dutch piracy in the next two decades by local resistance and Portuguese expeditions.\n\nOn the other hand, the Iberian Union opened to both countries a worldwide span of control, as Portugal dominated the African and Asian coasts that surrounded the Indian Ocean, and Spain the Pacific Ocean and both sides of Central and South America, while both shared the Atlantic Ocean space.\n\nWhen Philip II of Portugal (Philip III of Spain) died, he was succeeded by Philip III (and IV of Spain) who had a different approach on Portuguese issues. Taxes raised affected mainly the Portuguese merchants (Carmo Reis 1987). The Portuguese nobility began to lose its importance at the Spanish \"Cortes\", and government posts in Portugal were occupied by Spaniards. Ultimately, Philip III tried to make Portugal a royal province, and Portuguese nobles lost all of their power.\n\nThis situation culminated in a revolution by the nobility and high \"bourgeoisie\" on December 1, 1640, 60 years after the crowning of Philip I. The plot was planned by Antão Vaz de Almada, Miguel de Almeida and João Pinto Ribeiro. They, together with several associates, killed Secretary of State Miguel de Vasconcelos and imprisoned the king's cousin, the Duchess of Mantua, who had governed Portugal in his name. The moment was well chosen, as Philip's troops were at the time fighting the Thirty Years' War and also facing a revolution in Catalonia.\n\nThe support of the people became apparent almost immediately and soon John, 8th Duke of Braganza, was acclaimed King of Portugal throughout the country as John IV. By December 2, 1640, John had already sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Évora as sovereign of the country.\n\nThe subsequent Portuguese Restoration War against Philip III () consisted mainly of small skirmishes near the border. The most significant battles being the Battle of Montijo on May 26, 1644, the Battle of the Lines of Elvas (1659), the Battle of Ameixial (1663), the Battle of Castelo Rodrigo (1664), and the Battle of Montes Claros (1665); the Portuguese were victorious in all of these battles.\n\nSeveral decisions made by John IV to strengthen his forces made these victories possible. On December 11, 1640, the Council of War was created to organize all the operations. Next, the king created the Junta of the Frontiers, to take care of the fortresses near the border, the hypothetical defense of Lisbon, and the garrisons and sea ports. In December 1641, a tenancy was created to assure upgrades on all fortresses that would be paid with regional taxes. John IV also organized the army, established the Military Laws of King Sebastian, and developed intense diplomatic activity focused on restoring good relations with England.\n\nAfter gaining several decisive victories, John quickly tried to make peace. His demand that Philip recognize the new ruling dynasty in Portugal was not fulfilled until the reign of his son Afonso VI during the regency of Afonso's brother Infante Pedro (later King Pedro II of Portugal).\n\nThe Portuguese Royal House of Braganza began with John IV. The dukes of the House of Braganza were a branch of the House of Aviz created by King Afonso V for his half-uncle Afonso, 8th Count of Barcelos, illegitimate son of John I, first monarch of the House of Aviz. The Braganzas soon became one of the most powerful families of the kingdom and for the next decades would inter-marry with the main line of the Portuguese royal family. In 1565, John, 6th Duke of Braganza married Princess Catherine, granddaughter of King Manuel I. This connection with the Royal Family proved determinant in the rise of the House of Braganza to a Royal House. Catherine was one of the strongest claimants of the throne during the succession crisis of 1580 but lost the struggle to her cousin Philip II of Spain. Eventually Catherine's grandson became John IV of Portugal as he was held to be the legitimate heir.\n\nJohn IV was a beloved monarch, a patron of fine art and music, and a proficient composer and writer on musical subjects. He collected one of the largest libraries in the world. Among his writings is a defense of Palestrina and a Defense of Modern Music (Lisbon, 1649). Abroad, the Dutch took Malacca (January 1641) and the Sultan of Oman captured Muscat (1648). By 1654, however, most of Brazil was back in Portuguese hands and had effectively ceased to be a viable Dutch colony. John died in 1656, and his widow, Luisa of Guzman, married their daughter Catherine to Charles II of England in 1661 while she was regent for their son Afonso VI. Her dowry consisted of Tangier, Bombay and £1,000,000 sterling, making it the largest dowry ever brought by a queen consort. John IV was succeeded by his son Afonso VI.\n\n\n\n \n"}

Defined by the Cambridge Dictionary, the \"elite\" are \"those people or organizations that are considered the best or most powerful compared to others of a similar type.\"\n\nAmerican sociologist C. Wright Mills states that the power elite members recognize other members' mutual exalted position in society. \"As a rule, 'they accept one another, understand one another, marry one another, tend to work, and to think, if not together at least alike'.\" \"It is a well-regulated existence where education plays a critical role. Youthful upper-class members attend prominent preparatory schools, which not only open doors to such elite universities as Harvard, Columbia, Dartmouth College, Yale, and Princeton, but also to the universities' highly exclusive clubs. These memberships in turn pave the way to the prominent social clubs located in all major cities and serving as sites for important business contacts\".\n\nAccording to Mills, men receive the education necessary for elitist privilege to obtain their background and contacts, allowing them to enter three branches of the power elite, which are;\n\nAccording to Mills, the governing elite in the United States primarily draws its members from political leaders, including the president, and a handful of key cabinet members, as well as close advisers, major corporate owners and directors, and high-ranking military officers. These groups overlap and elites tend to circulate from one sector to another, consolidating power in the process.\n\nUnlike the ruling class, a social formation based on heritage and social ties, the power elite is characterized by the organizational structures through which its wealth is acquired. According to Mills, the power elite rose from \"the managerial reorganization of the propertied classes into the more or less unified stratum of the corporate rich\". Domhoff further clarified the differences in the two terms: \"The upper class as a whole does not do the ruling. Instead, class rule is manifested through the activities of a wide variety of organizations and institutions...Leaders within the upper class join with high-level employees in the organizations they control to make up what will be called the power elite\".\n\nThe Marxist theoretician Nikolai Bukharin anticipated the elite theory in his 1929 work, \"Imperialism and World Economy\": \"present-day state power is nothing but an entrepreneurs' company of tremendous power, headed even by the same persons that occupy the leading positions in the banking and syndicate offices\".\n\nThe \"power elite\" is a term used by Mills to describe a relatively small, loosely connected group of individuals who dominate American policymaking. This group includes bureaucratic, corporate, intellectual, military, media, and government elites who control the principal institutions in the United States and whose opinions and actions influence the decisions of the policymakers.\n\nThe basis for membership of a power elite is institutional power, namely an influential position within a prominent private or public organization. A study of the French corporate elite has shown that social class continues to hold sway in determining who joins this elite group, with those from the upper-middle class tending to dominate. Another study (published in 2002) of power elites in the United States under President George W. Bush (in office 2001-2009) identified 7,314 institutional positions of power encompassing 5,778 individuals. A later study of U.S. society noted demographic characteristics of this elite group as follows:\n\n\nIn the 1970s an organized set of policies promoted reduced taxes, especially for the wealthy, and a steady erosion of the welfare safety net. Starting with legislation in the 1980s, the wealthy banking community successfully lobbied for reduced regulation. The wide range of financial and social capital accessible to the power elite gives their members heavy influence in economic and political decision making, allowing them to move toward attaining desired outcomes. Sociologist Christopher Doob gives a hypothetical alternative, stating that these elite individuals would consider themselves the overseers of the national economy. Also appreciating that it is not only a moral, but a practical necessity to focus beyond their group interests. Doing so would hopefully alleviate various destructive conditions affecting large numbers of less affluent citizens.\n\nMills determined that there is an \"inner core\" of the power elite involving individuals that are able to move from one seat of institutional power to another. They, therefore, have a wide range of knowledge and interests in many influential organizations, and are, as Mills describes, \"professional go-betweens of economic, political, and military affairs\". Relentless expansion of capitalism and the globalizing of economic and military power, binds leaders of the power elite into complex relationships with nation states that generate global-scale class divisions. Sociologist Manuel Castells writes in \"The Rise of the Network Society\" that contemporary globalization does not mean that \"everything in the global economy is global\". So, a global economy becomes characterized by fundamental social inequalities with respect to the \"level of integration, competitive potential and share of the benefits from economic growth\". Castells cites a kind of \"double movement\" where on one hand, \"valuable segments of territories and people\" become \"linked in the global networks of value making and wealth appropriation\", while, on the other, \"everything and everyone\" that is not valued by established networks gets \"switched off...and ultimately discarded\". The wide-ranging effects of global capitalism ultimately affect everyone on the planet, as economies around the world come to depend on the functioning of global financial markets, technologies, trade and labor.\n\n\n\n"}

While not the first woman winemaker (Zelma Long and others), Kennedy was one of the very first owners of a brand to bear a woman's name in California, and one who came to the scene independent of the young women graduates of the University of California-Davis.\n\nBorn 1927, Kennedy moved from Santa Cruz to Santa Clara Valley at the age of 15, earning a degree from Stanford University at the age of 19. Married, and with the first of her four children, Kathryn moved to her Saratoga property in 1949 where she later decided to plant a vineyard. \n\nIn preparation for planting her , she attended two semesters of the viticulture program at University of California, Davis. There she was advised to plant Cabernet Sauvignon on her property. This recommendation was based not only on the \"Region Two\" climate classification for her land in Saratoga, but also on the market projections that were held during the late 1960s.\n\nIn planting her vineyard, Kennedy had Clone #8 cuttings sourced from David Bruce Vineyards developed for one year in an on-site nursery before planting in 1973. After selling fruit for two vintages to Mount Eden Vineyards in Saratoga, Kathryn established her brand and winery in 1979. Her adviser and first winemaker was Bill Anderson, who went on to be the longstanding winemaker at Chateau Julien in Carmel Valley AVA. From 1979 until 1988 Kathryn's winery produced only Estate Cabernet.\n\nJoining the process after the survey work of Ken Burnap and David Bennion, Kennedy contributed to modifying the boundaries of the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA, which was created in 1981. She successfully sought to include her land in this new appellation in order to be associated with the premium wine producers of this region.\n\nKennedy died August 23, 2009, at home surrounded by her family, after a long battle with cancer.\n\nKathryn Kennedy Winery is a small winery located in Saratoga, California. It is located on of land in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains near the Silicon Valley. Kathryn Kennedy Winery produces Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Sauvignon blanc, and a Lateral blend. \n\nKennedy left the winery in the hands of her youngest son Marty Mathis, who has been winemaker since 1981. In 2003 production was expanded to include a 4000 case red blend named Lateral made in Napa Valley as well as a Sauvignon blanc made from organic grapes. The Estate Vineyard was certified organic in time for the 2007 vintage.\n\n\n"}

Both councils, at least in theory, preside over the church, although the apostles have tended to supersede the standing high council in both of the largest Latter Day Saint denominations, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Community of Christ. \n\nBoth presiding high councils function as second presidencies to the church, the apostles overseeing the mission field, and the standing high council overseeing the stakes of Zion (or areas where the church has been organized into sustained units). \n\nHistorically, the standing high council had oversight over all other high councils within the stakes of Zion and was equal in authority to the Quorum of the Twelve. Because the standing high council oversaw stake high councils, the Quorum of the Twelve had oversight over the Seventy.\n\nIn the revelations of Joseph Smith, at least three types of high council are mentioned: \n\nThe standing presiding high council was intended to be located at the \"center place\" of Zion, or church headquarters. The center place itself is not considered a stake. Building upon the Book of Isaiah's imagery of Zion as a tent (Isaiah 54:2), the church leadership is found at the center pole of the tent, with the stakes of Zion providing support and balance to the center place.\n\nThe standing presiding high council in Zion acts with the First Presidency as a second presidency to the church. The traveling presiding high council acts to govern the church outside of the organized stakes. One of Smith's revelations states that \"the high council in Zion form a quorum equal in authority in the affairs of the church, in all their decisions, to the councils of the Twelve at the stakes of Zion.\"\n\nThe two presiding high councils, when combined, are equal in authority to the First Presidency. At the same time, both are subject to the First Presidency, which has undivided authority over all the church. \n\nIn addition to these two presiding councils, each of the several standing high councils in the stakes of Zion, when combined, are deemed to be equal in authority to standing high council in Zion. As such, the combined stake high councils potentially form a third-tier presidency of the church.\n\nOn February 17, 1834, Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, created the church's first high council at church headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio. This body consisted of twelve men and were under the direction of the First Presidency. This high council took on the role of chief judicial and legislative body of the church, except in areas where the church was not organized, and handled such things as excommunication trials and approval of all church spending. When church headquarters moved to Jackson County, Missouri, the newly formed Missouri high council took on a presiding role as the high council of Zion, and the Kirtland high council became subordinate. Later, when other high councils were established in newly formed stakes of the church, the high council of Zion took on the role of \"presiding\" over the lesser high councils. For example, cases tried in the high councils of outlying stakes were regularly appealed to the presiding high council. The president of this high council was the President of the Church, who at all relevant times was Smith.\n\nOriginally, the standing high council, under the direction of the First Presidency, was in a de facto supervisory role over the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which was a traveling high council with jurisdiction only outside of Zion or its stakes. For example, in 1838, when vacancies arose in the traveling high council, it was the standing high council at Far West, Missouri, that voted on and filled the vacancies. Later, as the traveling high council evolved and began to be known as the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, it acquired equal status with the standing high council. When the standing high council was dissolved after church members were expelled from Missouri, the high council organized at the new church headquarters in Nauvoo, Illinois, where it continued to function as the presiding high council of the church, overseeing appeals from high councils in outlying stakes.\n\nThe original members of the standing high council in Kirtland were:\n\nAfter the 1844 succession crisis, high councils developed differently in the various denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was composed of those who recognized Brigham Young and the apostles as the rightful successor to Smith, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles gained ascendancy and the standing high council diminished in authority, eventually disappearing completely. Post-exodus to Utah, the standing high council was established in a limited capacity as part of the central Salt Lake Stake, but it only served as a ratifying body for priesthood quorums in other stakes. An LDS Church Sunday School manual from 1980 states: “The Salt Lake Stake functioned more or less as a center stake that gave direction and guidance and had jurisdiction over other stakes. When quorum leaders in outlying areas needed new officers they sent a list of nominees to the Salt Lake Stake.” Of this arrangement, the manual states that “the function of stake organizations … had not been adequately defined for the maximum strength of the overall Church organization.”\n\nIn 1877, the First Presidency, with Brigham Young as President, sent out a letter to the church for the purpose of \"setting in order the quorums of priesthood\"; regarding the situation of the Salt Lake Stake having a \"center place\" supervisory role, the letter stated that “under the direction of the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles the presidency of the various Stakes will have the general supervision of all matters pertaining to the church within the limits of their Stakes.\" With that, any remaining vestiges of a standing presiding high council within the LDS Church disappeared.\n\nCommunity of Christ, formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church), has a functioning standing high council. Composed of twelve members, it retains some (but not all) of the duties detailed in Smith's original priesthood structure. One major difference is that its members are not general officers that are equal to the Council of Twelve Apostles. As such, the standing high council is not part of the World Church Leadership Council. The high council does, however, functions in an advisory role for the First Presidency. Its decisions may be overturned only through action of a World Conference. Major advisory decisions include its 1982 statement on homosexuality.\n\nThe \"Church Administrator's Handbook 2005\" states:\nThe current members of the Standing High Council are:\n"}

It takes place during the period of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression (specifically from 1924 to March 4, 1934). During this era in Turtledove's Southern Victory world, the Confederate States of America, stretching from Sonora to Virginia, is led by Whigs (with the fascist Freedom Party gaining more and more power) while the United States of America (which has been occupying Canada, Newfoundland, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the Sandwich Islands) is controlled by Socialists.\n\nThe title is derived from the apocalyptic vision appearing in Yeats' poem \"The Second Coming: \"Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, / The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere / The ceremony of innocence is drowned; / The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.\"\"\n\nThe new medium of \"the wireless\" (TL-191's name for a radio) offers novel ways for politicians to reach the people. Jake Featherston is the first politician to realize its potential, and soon people sitting in their homes can hear his raspy, thundery voice shouting from their radio sets, telling them the \"truth\" about the Yankees, Whigs, and Negroes. Even with this broadened appeal to the masses, the Freedom Party's hopes ebb further with Featherston's defeat at the polls in 1927 against incumbent Whig Burton Mitchel III. The Confederate people are just starting to enjoy the fruits of peace and prosperity, and the War and black uprisings are coming to be seen as part of the past, despite Featherston and his stalwarts doing their utmost to keep them alive in the collective memory. Things change when, in early 1929, the world's stock markets crash and financial and economic depression results.\n\nIn the 1928 US Presidential Election, Socialist Vice President Hosea Blackford and his running mate Hiram Johnson defeat Democratic candidate Calvin Coolidge by a narrow margin after finally taking the electoral votes from Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Blackford also carries the electoral votes from New York, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Colorado, and California. Coolidge is able to capture all six of the New England states (including his home and birth states of Massachusetts and Vermont), Kentucky, Houston, Kansas, Montana, Idaho, and Nevada. It was a closer race than the 1924 election had been, but Coolidge ultimately conceded to Blackford over the telephone. The two would meet for a rematch in the following election four years later.\n\nWhen the Great Depression occurs, Burton Mitchel III is blamed in the Confederacy. In the U.S. which came out of the 1920s with a booming economy and with the Canadian revolt having been crushed in 1925, newly elected President Hosea Blackford takes the heat, with shantytowns and slums being named \"Blackfordburghs\". Millions lose their jobs, and in Utah, (under military occupation since 1916), a fanatical Mormon sniper guns down Governor-General John J. Pershing. When Japan and the U.S. go to war in 1932 after Japan is caught smuggling weapons to Pacific Canada (the occupied Canadian province of British Columbia) by the U.S.S. \"Remembrance\", and Japanese bombers attack Los Angeles. In the 1932 presidential election, President Blackford is defeated by Calvin Coolidge and his running mate Herbert Hoover in a landslide. However Coolidge is never able to take office. On January 5, 1933, he dies of a heart attack about a month before he could take office. (In real life, Former President Coolidge died of a heart attack on the same date.) Vice President-Elect Hoover assumes the presidency, practicing Coolidge's campaign policy of government non-intervention in the economy.\n\nAt the same time in the C.S.A., whole cities are echoing to the boot-steps of marching Freedom Party Stalwarts, their ranks flowing once more with angry citizens, preparing for Election Day 1933. Jake Featherston attacks the Mitchel Administration with the venom and hate, blaming Mitchel for the Crash, and condemning his ineffectual response to the floods that devastated the Mississippi River valley in 1927. Confederates respond well to Featherston's rants. During the 1933 Confederate States Presidential Election, Featherston and his running mate Willy Knight defeat Whig candidate Samuel Longstreet and Radical Liberal candidate Cordell Hull. On taking the oath of office on March 4, 1934, the world holds its breath: \"Freedom\" is on the march.\n\nIn Europe, the storm clouds are also beginning to gather. The final vestiges of the Bolshevik Communist revolution were crushed by 1927; among the last holdouts was the Volga town of Tsaritsyn under the \"Man of Steel\" and his second in command the \"Hammer\". Under Tsar Mikhail II, Russia remains a primarily agricultural, backward country. Frequent anti-Semitic pogroms and foreign loans manage to deflect further restlessness but the latter were a contributing factor in the 1929 crash when Austria-Hungary demanded the repayment of a loan that Russia was unable to fulfill.\n\nAustria-Hungary itself remains a united empire but only the Austrians and Hungarians feel any loyalty to the Habsburg Dynasty monarchs. In fact, the multi-ethnic federation seems to be held together only by German financial and military aid. The Ottoman Empire also appears to be in the same boat, undertaking the genocide of its Armenian population. Despite strong censure from the United States, and more lukewarm protests from Berlin, the Turks continue the genocide until the Ottoman Empire is nearly devoid of Armenians.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II rules a strong Germany and his troops continue to occupy Belgium, the Ukraine, and the puppet Kingdom of Poland, but post-war relations with the U.S. soured to the point that many people on both sides of the Atlantic believed that Germany and the United States would someday be engaged in a full-fledged war. The Business Collapse puts an end to that, however, and the old allies reassert themselves once more.\n\nAfter the Third Republic is overthrown around 1930, France finds itself under \"Action Française\" and a new monarchy under King Charles XI, who begins talking about the return of Alsace-Lorraine to French rule. In the United Kingdom, the fascist-inspired \"Silver Shirts\" under Oswald Mosley hold similar views, and support \"Action Française\", though they never become more than a minority in the British Parliament. Italy never comes under Benito Mussolini's Fascist rule but, other than this, little information is provided about its history in this alternative timeline.\n\nIn the Pacific, Japan is far from quiet. Prior to the Pacific War with the United States, Japan pressured both France and the Netherlands to cede Indochina and the East Indies, respectively, with proper compensation. Britain fears that its Pacific colonies of Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, and possibly India will also be invaded and annexed by Japan; however, Japan shows no interest in doing so. Japan also gains much influence in the Nationalists' Republic of China during this period and seems to have established a puppet state of Manchukuo in the northeast of Manchuria as well. This empire is in addition to Japan's possessions in the Philippines and Guam, which were \"liberated\" from Spain in the early years of the 20th century (eliminating our history of American temporary colonization).\n\nRoland Green in his review for \"Booklist\" described this novel as \"another harrowing and literate installment in Turtledove's standard-setting alternate history\". Jeff Guinn of the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" described the plot as \"reasonably intelligent, with solid premises\".\n"}

His dramatic narrative of her exploits is cut short when Anya knocks on the bathroom door. He tries to explain his actions, and Anya is unsatisfied (reminding him of Buffy's irritated reaction the previous night, when he had followed her on patrol). He explains his desire to make a record of the events leading up to the apocalypse, in case humans survive, so that they will know what Buffy and her allies did.\n\nLater, Andrew talks to the video camera and uses his big white board to illustrate and explain the array of evil forces in Sunnydale. He interviews various members of the household, blithely re-imagining current and past incidents in an idealized and incorrect way.\n\nBuffy arrives at the school to find two boys fighting, a shy girl turning invisible because nobody notices her, and various other disturbances. Buffy finds Robin, who has just been injured by a thrown rock. As she bandages his head, they discuss the bizarre (yet familiar) chaos dominating the school. She explains her suspicions that the activation of the Seal of Danzalthar is behind the morning's chaos. They investigate the newly uncovered seal in the school basement. As Robin gets close to the seal, he is infused with evil. In a demonic voice, he berates Buffy for her involvement with Spike. Buffy pulls Robin away, freeing him; he recalls nothing.\n\nAt the Summers' home, Andrew continues his interviews. He causes Xander and Anya to re-examine their feelings for each other. Spike uses reshoots to seem more threatening. Wood and Buffy arrive and inform Andrew he is going to help close the Seal; it is now surrounded by five possessed students and glowing with light. A magically forced memory allows Andrew to locate the magically charged knife the First wanted him to use to sacrifice Jonathan.\n\nBuffy tells Andrew that she believes that he can help her quiet the seal. They leave for the school, accompanied by Spike and Robin. They arrive to find that the school is being destroyed by ongoing student riots. Andrew tries to film their walk through the halls, but they are attacked by several students who possess enhanced strength. Buffy and Andrew make their way to the basement while Spike and Robin guard the stairway entrance. As they walk, Andrew revisits his memories of killing Jonathan, relating several different versions of the story as if each are true. They enter the basement room carefully and find five students standing around the seal, their eyes freshly cut and sealed (like the Bringers). In the Summers' basement, Xander and Anya revel in the aftermath of having sex again before talking about moving on with their lives (a conversation that fades into an awkward silence).\n\nAt the school, Spike and Robin are attacked by more students. Spike inadvertently confirms that he killed Robin's mother, and Robin makes a failed attempt to stake Spike from behind; in the chaos of the fight, his actions go unnoticed. Buffy battles the new Bringers while Andrew records the scene with his camera. Once she has killed the Bringers, Buffy pulls out the knife and advances on Andrew, revealing that they must spill his blood to quiet the Seal, since he was the one who initially activated it. Buffy describes the bitter prospects for their future, and chastises his constant attempts to avoid taking responsibility for his actions. Andrew, frightened to tears, admits how willingly he had murdered Jonathan, and how he is sorry. He tells Buffy that he deserves whatever happens to him. Buffy leans Andrew over the Seal so that his tears fall on its surface. The Seal closes and becomes quiet. Buffy reveals to Andrew that tears, not blood, were necessary to close the seal; she has no plans to kill him. The students around the school are released, and the violence stops.\n\nLater, a sad Andrew talks to the camera in the bathroom again, confessing that he probably will die, and that he deserves to. Without another word, he shuts the camera off.\n\nIn the DVD commentary for \"Conversations with Dead People\", Danny Strong (Jonathan) revealed that the interstitial scenes of Andrew visualizing himself, Jonathan and Warren \"as Gods\" were the final scenes he shot for the series.\n\n"}

In association with his father, he became involved in the management of newspapers including \"The Advertiser\"; he also served as editor of \"The Saturday Express\" and as a journalist. After \"The Advertiser\" was sold in 1929 and converted to a public company, he became a director, and for a time vice-chairman; an association that continued until his death. In 1901 he began a long association with the Adelaide City Council, serving as Mayor of Adelaide (1911–1913) and later as Lord Mayor of Adelaide (1927–1930). He was knighted in 1935. The now removed Lavington Bonython Fountain on North Terrace was erected in front of the SA Museum in his honour.\n\nBorn in Adelaide on 10 September 1875, John Lavington Bonython was the eldest son of Sir John Langdon Bonython and his wife Mary Louise Fredericka, née Balthasar. He attended Prince Alfred College in Adelaide, and joined \"The Advertiser\" in 1896. During his time with newspapers, he worked on \"The Advertiser\", \"Chronicle\" and the \"Express\", serving as the editor of the \"Saturday Express\" between 1912 and 1930.\n\nLavington Bonython became directly involved with the Adelaide City Council when he was elected as a councillor in 1901. He became an alderman in 1907, served as Mayor (1912-1913), and as Lord Mayor (1928-1930). His appointment in 1912 made Bonython the second youngest person to serve as Adelaide's Mayor, and during his time with the council he was noted for his focus on Adelaide's heritage. For much of his period as acting mayor and mayor he was a widower, and his sister, Mrs. H. A. Parsons, performed the role of Mayoress at official functions.\n\nHe was knighted in 1935.\n\nAmongst his other activities were a number of positions on company boards, including the Royal Adelaide Hospital, Municipal Tramways Trust, and serving as a director and Vice-Chairman of \"The Advertiser\". In particular, Lavington Bonython was a member of the inaugural board for Minda Inc, remaining with the organisation for 62 years.\n\nLavington Bonython died on 6 November 1960.\n\nJohn Lavington Bonython married twice, in total producing six children.\n\nOn 16 April 1904 he married Blanche Ada Bray, born on 10 November 1881 in Adelaide, only daughter of Sir John Cox Bray and Alice Maude Hornabrook, by whom he had a son and two daughters (John, Elizabeth and Ada). She died in childbirth on 5 November 1908, aged 26.\n\n\n\nFour years later, on 11 December 1912, Lavington Bonython married 21-year-old Constance Jean Warren, (later Lady Bonython OBE), with whom he had three children, Warren, Katherine and Kym. Lavington was Mayor of Adelaide at the time, and Jean was widely referred to as \"the Baby Mayoress\". She was amazingly active and on dozens of committees too numerous to mention here. She had a major stroke in 1970, and in the period between then and her death in 1977, her son Warren wrote her biography: \"I'm no lady : the reminiscences of Constance Jean, Lady Bonython, O.B.E. 1891-1977\", edited by C.

Following the departure of Würzel (Michael Burston) in 1995, the band returned to the same three-man \"classic Motörhead line up\"; bass guitar/vocals, lead guitar, and drums. In a rare outside songwriter credit, Swedish Erotica guitarist Magnus Axx contributed to writing the song \"Civil War\". This album was also the first since \"Ace of Spades\" (1980) to have a picture of the band on the cover. Despite being only a three-piece band, the band had a heavier style on this work than on its previous album, \"Sacrifice\". Vocalist and bassist Lemmy Kilmister recalls that, amidst the touring, the record took about four weeks to write new songs and four weeks to record in the studio. Lemmy talked about the return to being a three piece:\nIn Joel McIver's 2011 book \"Overkill: The Untold Story of Motörhead\", drummer Mikkey Dee is quoted saying that the songwriting was affected by guitarist Würzel's departure:\n\nThe album is notable for featuring a picture of Lemmy without his trademark mutton chops.

Fort Morris was constructed in Sunbury by the authority of the Continental Congress. A contingent of British soldiers attempted to take the fort on November 25, 1778. The American contingent at Fort Morris was led by Colonel John McIntosh (c. 1748–1826). The Americans numbered only 127 Continental soldiers plus militiamen and local citizens. The fort itself was crudely constructed and could not have withstood any concerted attack.\n\nThe British commander, Colonel Fuser, demanded Fort Morris' surrender through a written note to the American rebels. Though clearly outnumbered (he had only about 200 men plus artillery), Colonel McIntosh's defiant written response to the British demand included the following line: \"As to surrendering the fort, receive this laconic reply: COME AND TAKE IT!\". The British declined to attack, in large part due to their lack of intelligence regarding other forces in the area. Colonel Fuser believed a recent skirmish in the area, combined with Colonel McIntosh's bravado, might have reflected reinforcements and so the British withdrew.\n\nThe British returned in January 1779 with a larger force. They later conquered and controlled nearly all of Georgia for the next few years. Col. McIntosh's defiance was one successful and heroic event which inspired the patriots as the War moved to the Carolinas and then north.\n\nThe Fort Morris Historical Marker is on Martin Road, Midway, Georgia. It is located at the visitor center for the Fort Morris Historic Site. The center is located off Fort Morris Road, at the end of the Colonels Island Highway (Georgia Route 38). The marker memorializes the battle and notes the \"Come and Take It!\" response.\n\nIn recognition of his valor of defending Fort Morris in Sunbury, McIntosh was awarded a sword by the Georgia Legislature with the words \"Come and Take It\" engraved on the blade. McIntosh later served in the War of 1812 as an American General, still protecting the Georgia coast. He served honorably, receiving honors from the City of Savannah for his service.\n\nIn early January 1831, Green DeWitt wrote to Ramón Músquiz, the top political official of Bexar, and requested armament for defense of the colony of Gonzales. This request was granted by delivery of a small used cannon. The small bronze cannon was received by the colony and signed for on March 10, 1831, by James Tumlinson, Jr. The swivel cannon was mounted to a blockhouse in Gonzales and later was the object of Texas pride. At the minor skirmish known as the Battle of Gonzales—the first land battle of the Texas Revolution against Mexico—a small group of Texans successfully resisted the Mexican forces who had orders from Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea to seize their cannon. As a symbol of defiance, the Texans had fashioned a flag containing the phrase \"come and take it\" along with a black star and an image of the cannon that they had received four years earlier from Mexican officials. This was the same message that was sent to the Mexican government when they told the Texans to return the cannon; lack of compliance with the initial demands led to the failed attempt by the Mexican military to forcefully take back the cannon.\n\nReplicas of the original flag can be seen in the Texas State Capitol, the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum, the Sam Houston State University CJ Center, the University of Texas at El Paso Library, the Marine Military Academy headquarters building, the Hockaday School Hoblitzelle Auditorium, and in Perkins Library at Duke University.\n\n"}

{"id": "2222518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222518", "title": "One-name study", "text": "One-name study\n\nA one-name study is a project researching a specific surname, as opposed to a particular pedigree (ancestors of one person) or descendancy (descendants of one person or couple). Some people who research a specific surname may restrict their research geographically and chronologically, perhaps to one country and time period, while others may collect all occurrences world-wide for all time.\n\nA one-name study is not limited to persons who are related biologically. Studies may have a number of family trees which have no link with each other.\n\nFindings from a one-name study are useful to genealogists. Onomasticians, who study the etymology, meaning and geographic origin of names, also draw on the macro perspective provided by a one-name study.\n\nMany people conducting family history, genealogical or onomastic research may conduct a one-name study of a surname in a given period or locality quite informally.\n\nA full one-name study can be daunting, particularly if the surname is very common. Conversely, a rare surname can be difficult to trace. Since such studies are usually conducted by individuals as a pastime, they are generally feasible only when a surname is not used by more than a couple of thousand contemporary people, so that the total historical data-set is numbered in the low tens of thousands. Where a surname is used by hundreds of thousands, or millions of people, it would be practically impossible to differentiate these persons using national-index data alone.\n\nIn some cultures, one-name studies are impossible, since hereditary surnames are not used at all or in the case of names such as Singh may represent religious practice rather than an ancestry. Since a majority of human societies use patronymic surnames, one-name studies generally focus on male succession and ignore family relationships through marriage.\n\nSome researchers are satisfied to collect all information and group it geographically, approximately representing the different family groups. Others attempt to reconstruct lineages.\n\nIn most one-name studies, a united lineage will not be discovered, but broad perspectives can be achieved, giving clues to name origins and migrations. Many researchers are motivated to go beyond the one-name-study stage and to compile fully researched, single-family histories of some of the families they discover.\n\nAccessibility of the data required for a one-name study varies from country to country. Where civil registration indexes are open to public search, they may not be online or gathered in the national capital, but are scattered through the states, as in Australia, or towns, as in France and the United States. In many countries, such as Germany, civil registration and census data are regarded as a state prerogative: vital data are only available to the persons concerned and 19th-century census returns are not available at all.\n\nOne-name studies in the United States have become more feasible than they were, thanks to the increased availability of online indexes to 19th-century and early-20th-century censuses.\n\nMore limited one-name studies can be conducted using other national indexes including:\n\nOne-name studies are generally rounded out with a miscellany of information drawn from national bibliographies, archival catalogues, patent databases, reports of law cases, tax lists, newspaper indexes and web searches. A one-name researcher may also report on the linguistic origins of the surname and its use in place names and corporate names.\n\nCivil registration indexes of births, marriages and deaths in England and Wales (for the period from 1837), Scotland (from 1855) and Northern Ireland (from 1865 and Protestant marriages from 1845) are in the public domain, and anyone may apply to see the details of any birth, marriage or death. For the period before civil registration, in principle back to 1538 in England and Wales and 1533 in Scotland, parish registers have recorded birth and/or baptisms, marriages and deaths and/or burials. These are also freely available, although the survival of such registers is less likely as we reach back to the earliest dates of this period.\n\nThe civil registration index books for England and Wales were scanned and made available online in 2004 by the subscription web site Findmypast (formerly \"1837online\") and an index has also been created by volunteers for the free web site FreeBMD. Records for Scotland can be searched at the pay-per-view web site ScotlandsPeople, and this means that a one-name study with a British focus can be conducted from anywhere in the world. Civil registration indexes for Northern Ireland can be viewed at the General Register Office (Northern Ireland) (GRONI) on payment of an entrance fee.\n\nCensuses have taken place in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland since the 1800s. The Irish Census returns for the years 1841 to 1891 are not available having been destroyed. Otherwise information from the 10-yearly censuses from 1841 until 1911 is available and facilitates the linking of surname data into family groups.\n\nSince it is possible to extract a complete data-set of a given surname from these public records, ancestries of most 20th-century persons with a particular surname in England and Wales can be compiled without needing any contact to the persons concerned.\n\nWhile most one-name studies are conducted as a pastime, rather than as an economic activity, the sheer volume of information to be organised may require semi-professional data-processing and publishing skills. To avoid retyping large volumes of data by hand, one-name researchers are often skilled at data scraping and automated reformatting. The data must be carefully structured. An accurate copy of the original indexes must be drawn up, and updated when they are amended. Errors and conflicts in the indexes are noted. Links to those tables appear in the roll of individual persons.\n\nMany one-name researchers keep data tables in computer spreadsheets because it is possible to see hundreds of items on a single screen and use thinking power to detect patterns. Genealogy software is used by many researchers to collate and define family trees. Others employ relational database software.\n\nIncreasingly one-namers are becoming involved in Surname DNA projects, using Y-DNA testing to analyse relationships among different lineages bearing the same surname (or suspected spelling variants).\n\nOne-name researchers often begin a study in the hope that obtaining a massive data set will give them sufficient perspective to break through a barrier in their own family history research. Some are motivated by the belief, only rarely borne out, that kinship can be documented among all persons sharing a surname.\n\nThe Guild of One-Name Studies was established in the United Kingdom in September 1979, and maintains a register of surnames being researched by members. It is a channel for anyone wishing to contact the person researching a particular registered name. In 2014 the Guild had over 2,000 world-wide members conducting studies of individual surnames and their variants.\n\nTraditionally, publication of definitive research is undertaken by printing a book or by publishing a one-name periodical. Such publications are often sponsored by formally established one-name groups. The UK-based Federation of Family History Societies includes several One-Name Societies, whilst the Guild of One-Name Studies has many members who are associated with such organisations. Advice on setting up a one-name group appears in a short booklet, \"One-Name Family History Groups\" by Derek Palgrave published by the Halsted Trust in 2008.\n\nToday many studies are presented online, since the data can be continually updated and made available worldwide.\n\nA number of Guild of One-Name Studies members have taken advantage of the member benefit called the Members Website Project (MWP) which enables a members to both share and publish their study as a website whilst continuing to work on their study.\n\n\n"}

Some commentators maintain that \"Klopman\" is an inherently funny word and that names other than Klopman would not be as funny; they note that this joke has survived essentially unaltered for decades. It has been a running gag on Garfield and Friends.\n\nThe Klopman Diamond appears in the 1981 \"Spider-Man\" animated series episode “Triangle of Evil,” owned by Mr. Klopman, proprietor of Klopman’s Jewelry.\n\nThe Klopman Diamond was used as a running gag in the animated television show \"Garfield and Friends\". For example, there would be a giant diamond in a museum display case, which Garfield, as the museum tour guide, would casually identify in passing as the Klopman diamond; or Nermal would be required to polish the Klopman Diamond as one of a series of tricks during the obedience event of a cat show. At one point, Garfield even mentioned it as a \"rare and valuable gem…as well as a pointless running gag on a popular Saturday morning cartoon show.\" There was a segment devoted to it in the episode \"The Curse of Klopman\" (see List of Garfield and Friends episodes). The first episode to mention it (and the second reference to it in a U.S. Acres segment) was in the episode \"Wanted: Wade\". The Klopman Diamond was also briefly mentioned in the U.S. Acres episode \"Secrets of the Animated Cartoon\" as one of many things that frightened Wade (the others being monsters, bugs, and cheese sandwiches).\nThe Klopman Diamond also appeared in a \"Screaming with Binky\" short, in which Binky the Clown inadvertently caused a diamond cutter to shatter the Klopman Diamond into a small pile of dust.\n\nMark Evanier claims credit for adding references to the Klopman diamond to \"Garfield and Friends\".\n\nAs a nod to the old animated series, the more recent series \"The Garfield Show\" (also written by Evanier) has also included references to the Klopman Diamond, and a crystal referred to as the Klopman Crystal is made a plot device in the direct-to-video film \"Garfield's Pet Force\". There is also a reference to the Klopman Diamond in the October 2012 issue of the Garfield comic book.\n\nA later joke of Myron Cohen, similar in nature, goes as follows:\n\n"}

Mullally grew up in Western Australia, and played for the Australian Under-19 side against their West Indian counterparts in 1987/88.\n\nThat same season he made his first-class debut for Western Australia in their Sheffield Shield final victory over Queensland at Perth. He stayed with Western Australia for another couple of seasons, with variable success.\n\nMeanwhile, he had made his Hampshire debut, against Oxford University in May 1988. He did not take a wicket in that match, and he spent the rest of the English summer in Hampshire's second team. A more productive time followed back in Australia in 1988/89 as he took 23 first-class wickets, including seven in an innings victory in an MG Kailis-Kemplast Trophy game against Tamil Nadu at Perth.\n\nMullally did not play in England in 1989, and the 1989/90 Australian season was something of a disappointment as he took just 11 first-class wickets, but in 1990 Mullally returned to county cricket with Leicestershire, doing reasonably well with the highlight a haul of 6–38 (which remains his best in List A cricket) in a one-day game against the touring New Zealanders in June. That winter he returned to Australia, playing just a single game for Victoria.\n\nFor several years Mullally performed steadily with Leicestershire, capped in 1993 and taking between 40 and 70 first-class wickets a season while playing in the great majority of the county's games. His most successful year during this period was 1996, when he claimed 70 first-class wickets and, perhaps more startling for a man renowned throughout his career for his incompetence with the bat, made his only two first-class fifties, both at number 11: he scored 68 against Surrey in June, then followed it up in September with 75 against Middlesex.\n\nIn 2000 he returned to Hampshire, where he had begun his career in England, and he and Shane Warne carried the county's bowling attack almost by themselves in a difficult season for the club; that August he recorded his best bowling figures of 9–93 against Derbyshire (following up with 5–95 in the second innings for match figures of 14–188), although the game was drawn.\n\nMullally continued to be a regular pick in the Hampshire side for the next few years, averaging under 20 with the ball in both 2000 and 2001, and claiming five-wicket hauls on six occasions in the latter season, but from 2003 onwards his performances began to fall away, especially in first-class cricket in which he took only 35 wickets in 2003 and 2004 combined. His county persevered with him for some while, and in 2004 he took 22 List A wickets, but the award of a benefit season in 2005 could not disguise his decline and after a friendly against Kent and three totesport League matches in April and May, he dropped out of the first team entirely. At the end of the 2005 season he announced his retirement.\n\nIn 1996 also, he was selected by England for the first Test against India at Edgbaston. He took five wickets in the match as England won by eight wickets, and played in all six Tests that summer against India and Pakistan, as well as in three One Day Internationals against the latter opponents. It was to be in ODIs where Mullally was to make his mark as an England cricketer, not so much for his penetration as for his accuracy: his economy rate was so good that at one time he was listed as the second-best bowler in the world in that form of the game.\n\nMullally was in and out of the Test side from then on, his best period being 1998/99, when he took 12 Australian wickets in four Ashes Tests at 30.33, including his career-best 5–105 at Brisbane Cricket Ground, and the following home series against New Zealand, when he claimed 11 wickets at 27.27 from three games. In limited-overs cricket, however, he was still considered a central part of the team, and he took 10 wickets at just 17.60 in the 1999 World Cup, second in England's averages (just behind Darren Gough) and with the best economy rate of any English bowler in the competition.\n\nIn June 2001 he played his final ODI against Australia at The Oval, and conceded 27 runs from his four overs as England were crushed by eight wickets, and also his last Test against the same opponents at Headingley when recalled for a single time in August, having played his previous Test match against South Africa in January 2000.\n\nMullally was a poor batsman, and more often than not occupied the No. 11 position in the England batting line-up. However, he struck an aggressive 16 off 15 balls, including 3 cross-batted fours off Glenn McGrath, to help England to a 12-run win against Australia at Melbourne in 1998/99. His highest Test score of 24 against Pakistan featured several airborne boundaries off Wasim Akram. Allegedly the then England coach David Lloyd had offered Mullally 30 pints of Guinness to score 30 in that match.\n"}

The name was drawn from Loch Ard, a loch which lies to the west of Aberfoyle, and to the east of Loch Lomond. It means \"high lake\" in Scottish Gaelic.\n\n\"Loch Ard\" belonged to the Loch Line, a major shipping line operating between Great Britain and Australia. It was a three-masted clipper ship, of 263' in length, with a tonnage of 1693 tonnes, and was constructed by Barclay, Curdle & Co. of Glasgow.\n\n\"Loch Ard\" departed England on 1 March 1878, bound for Melbourne, commanded by Captain Gibb and with a crew of 37 men. It was carrying 17 passengers and assorted cargo (total of 54 people). On 1 June, the ship was approaching Melbourne. The crew expected to sight land but encountered heavy fog. The inquest determined that, unable to see the Cape Otway lighthouse; having faulty chronometers on board; and not having been able to take a reading to establish his exact position due to bad weather conditions over the previous few days, the captain was unaware how close he was running to the coast. The fog lifted around 4am, revealing breakers and cliff faces. Captain Gibb quickly ordered sail to be set to come about and get clear of the coast, but they were unable to do so in time, and ran aground on a reef. The masts and rigging came crashing down, killing some people on deck and preventing the lifeboats from being launched effectively. The ship sank within 10 or 15 minutes of striking the reef.\n\nThe widespread popular belief that Captain Gibb mistook the opening of the nearby Loch Ard Gorge for Port Phillip Heads has no basis in fact or probability: there is no physical or cartographic resemblance whatsoever; ships are obliged to stop outside the Heads to take on a pilot; and the \"Loch Ard\" never entered the Gorge at all.\n\nThe only two survivors of the wreck were Eva Carmichael, who survived by clinging to a spar for five hours, and Thomas (Tom) R. Pearce, an apprentice who clung to the overturned hull of a lifeboat. Tom Pearce came ashore first, then heard Eva's shouts and went back into the ocean to rescue her. They came ashore at what is now known as Loch Ard Gorge and sheltered there before seeking assistance. Coincidentally, Tom Pearce was the step son of James Pearce, captain of the .\n\"Loch Ard\"'s cargo included a range of luxury goods, including a grand piano which washed up in the Gorge, and a large decorative porcelain peacock made by Minton in England, intended to be displayed in the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880. The peacock was recovered intact and was eventually able to be displayed a century later for the Victoria Pavilion at the Brisbane 1988 World Exposition. It is now on display at the Flagstaff Hill Maritime Museum in Warrnambool, along with a number of other relics of the wreck.\n\n\"Eva and the Cabin Boy\" by Sheila Dewey - produced at the Warehouse Theatre in Croydon in 1994 - concerned the \"Loch Ard\" shipwreck.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The band is known for its original rock novelty songs and often satirical covers of popular songs both foreign and local. The band is adept at playing in various musical genres.\n\nParokya ni Edgar has been referred to by local media outlets and numerous award-giving bodies as \"Pambansang Banda ng Pilipinas\" (\"The National Band of the Philippines\").\n\nDespite having \"Edgar\" in the band's name, none of the members are named Edgar.\n\nOriginally named Comic Relief, the band's initial members were a group of high school students composed of vocalists Chito Miranda, Jeric Estaco, and Vinci Montaner, along with guitarists Mikko Yap and Gab Chee Kee, all hailing from Ateneo de Manila University. They were regulars in after-school jam sessions, before performing an opening number for an Eraserheads concert. This served as their break in the music industry and prompted them to add a drummer and bassist – Ateneo schoolmate Dindin Moreno and Miranda's childhood friend Buwi Meneses, respectively. Around the same time they changed the band's name to Parokya ni Edgar. After high school, Mikko and Jeric withdrew from the band to pursue other interests. Soon after, the remaining band members invited Darius Semaña, Meneses's former bandmate, to take the role of lead guitar.\n\nThe band name's origin had been a subject of debate among fans as the band members had never given full confirmation. It was not until 2013 that Chito Miranda officially addressed it through a post on their Facebook page. The title \"Parokya Ni Edgar\" came from a joke a classmate named Bambi Cuna made during one of their high school classes. Sources state that the class subject was Filipino. When the teacher asked Cuna where Jose Rizal's fictional hero, Crisostomo Ibarra (in the novel \"Noli Me Tangere\") was educated, it was said that Cuna made up a daft answer, \"sa Parokya ni Edgar\". Then vocalist Jeric Estaco decided on impromptu to introduce the band as \"Parokya ni Edgar\" in their first live performance. From there, the band name just stuck.\n\nBy the late 1990s, PNE became regular performers in Club Dredd, a popular club in Manila at the time. The band slowly gained popularity during the height of the Filipino rock explosion, with the local rock community welcoming the influence of foreign grunge acts such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden.\n\nEventually, the late managing director of Universal Records, Bella Dy Tan, signed them as contract artists after witnessing one of their Club Dredd performances.\n\nSoon, their initial recordings \"Buloy\", \"Trip (Siopao Na Special)\" and \"Lutong Bahay (Cooking Ng Ina Mo)\" gained radio airplay. Their first album, \"Khangkhungkherrnitz\"(1996) became a triple platinum hit in the Philippines, having sold 120,000 units. The next albums were equal successes - \"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy\" (1997) was awarded triple platinum, \"Jingle Balls Silent Night Holy Cow\" (1998) with gold, and \"Gulong Itlog Gulong\" (1999) with triple platinum. This included the single \"Halaga\", one of the most popular songs in their career. \"Halaga\" was such a hit in the country that it further boosted PNE's career, cementing their name into OPM history.\n\nAfter a five-year hiatus, they released their junior studio album \"Edgar Edgar Musikahan\" in 2002. \n\nOn July 14, 2003, they released the studio album \"Bigotilyo\", with the main single \"Mr. Suave\". \"Mr. Suave\" proved to be just as popular as its predecessors and stayed on the music charts for more than a year. The song became so popular in the Philippines that a few commercials and political campaigns borrowed stanzas from it. Same Year in 2003, Parokya celebrated their 10th Year Anniversary with new gigs and concerts in various shows in the Philippines and also around the world like Hong Kong, Canada such as Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario & more Canadian provinces tour were performed for PNE, and the United States such as New York, New Jersey, Hawaii, Arizona, California and among other U.S. States. were performed by PNE.\n\n2004 was the year of release of \"Inuman Sessions Vol. 1\", PNE's first compilation DVD album celebrating their 11th anniversary. The DVD showcased the band's prerecorded live studio performance of their hit songs to a selected audience. The DVD album met success in sales nationwide.\n\nThey released their 9th studio album, \"Middle-Aged Juvenile Novelty Pop Rockers\" in 2010 with the single \"Paki-usap Lang (Lasingin Nyo Ako)\". The album was met with moderate success in both charts and sales.\n\nIn 2011, PNE joined the roster of \"Tanduay's First Five\" and \"RockFest\" replacing long running Tanduay endorser 6cyclemind.\n\nThe following year, PNE released their 2nd compilation DVD album \"Inuman Sessions Vol. 2\" - a follow up to their \"Inuman Sessions Vol. 1\". Later that same year, Montaner officially left the band on good terms with both the members and crew.\n\n2013 marked PNE's 20th anniversary in the OPM industry. The band launched their 13th album \"Bente\" as commemoration, and as this was a milestone, Vinci Montaner temporarily reunited with the band for the album's cover art and signings.\n\nIn 2014, PNE was awarded with the \"MYX Magna Award\" for their artistic contribution to OPM Rock History & also celebrating their 20th anniversary of their opm rock band of the mid 1990s. They are the 2nd OPM Rock Band to receive this award after Eraserheads in 2009.\n\nAll throughout 2015, the band toured selected cities in the United States; they headlined at the Landmark Loews Theater in Jersey City, New Jersey on March 21, 2015. That same year, the band began recording for their next album and contained the tracks \"Sing\" and \"Lagi Mong Tatandaan\", the former featuring Rico Blanco. The album is entitled \"Pogi Years Old\". The cover album was revealed on September 2, 2016 through their Facebook page and expected to be released by 2016. Former member Vinci Montaner will appear on the album as a featured artist. On September 9, 2016, the band held a free surprise show at the Bonifacio Shrine in Manila. The album was released on October 17, 2016 nationwide and on digital format. The band would held an album launch at Eastwood Central Plaza on October 16, 2016. This marks the return of Vinci Montaner, who would join permanently days later.\n\nOn November 22, 2017, Parokya was now named as the newest celebrity music star inductee in the 2017 Eastwood City Walk of Fame in Eastwood City Mall Quezon City for their influence in Pinoy rock music. Parokya was the 3rd related music group and 1st OPM Rock band to be inducted to the Eastwood City Walk Of Fame. \n\nParokya Ni Edgar also recently celebrated their 25th silver anniversary last October 2018 following with more concerts and more new gigs to come.\n\nA musical adaptation of Parokya Ni Edgar's discography in cooperation with longest running gag comedy show \"Bubble Gang\" entitled \"Bubble Gang Parokya Na To: A Laugh Story The Musical\" was recently performed last February 15, 2019 at Waterfront Hotel Cebu City, produced by GMA Kapuso Concerts.

'Scientists, politicians, religious leaders, and tens of thousands of other concerned people have joined PETA in calling for Mali to be freed. We in Parokya ni Edgar do, too. Even if the elephant exhibit at the Manila Zoo were to be doubled or tripled in size, it would still not be adequate to house one elephant, never mind additional ones. While zoos around the world have spent upwards of 2 billion pesos on attempts at more appropriately sized elephant exhibits, more and more zoos have recognized that the needs of these complex and intelligent animals cannot be met in captivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParokya ni Edgar is also known for parodying songs of famous singers and bands.\n\n\n\nAwit Awards\n\nNU Rock Awards\n\nMTV Asia Awards\n\nMTV Pilipinas\n\nMTV Video Music Awards\n\nMYX Music Awards\n\nYahoo!

{"id": "2222601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222601", "title": "Superboy (TV series)", "text": "Superboy (TV series)\n\nSuperboy is an American television series based on the fictional DC comic book character Superman's early years as Superboy. The show ran from 1988–1992 in syndication. It was renamed The Adventures of Superboy at the start of the third season.\n\nThe \"Superboy\" series was brought to the screen by executive producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind, the producers of the first three \"Superman\" movies and the 1984 \"Supergirl\" movie. This series and the release of the 1988 \"Superman\" animated series on CBS coincided with the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Superman character that year. Ironically, the series came about a year after DC Comics had \"erased\" the character of Superboy from their continuity in the \"Man of Steel\" reboot by John Byrne. Nevertheless, the show went on in October 1988 with John Haymes Newton playing the lead role of Superboy/Clark Kent, along with Stacy Haiduk as love interest Lana Lang and Jim Calvert as Clark's college roommate T.J. White.\n\n\"Superboy\" was the first weekly TV series to be produced at the then new Disney/MGM Studios. For the second season onward, the series moved several miles up Interstate 4 to Universal Studios Florida, the largest motion picture and television-sound facility outside Hollywood, where it was then showcased as that studio's first weekly television product.\n\nAt first, much of the action centered around stories that Clark and T.J. reported on for the college newspaper, the \"Shuster Herald\". All the exterior scenes shot at \"Shuster University\" are actually filmed on the main campus of the University of Central Florida. Siegelville, however, was depicted as a coastal city, as evidenced by imagery of both the new and old Sunshine Skyway Bridges (Interstate 275) in St. Petersburg, Florida in the opening credits.\n\n\"Superboy\" was scripted by many actual comic-book writers. Superman editors Mike Carlin and Andrew Helfer penned several episodes, such as \"The Alien Solution\", its sequel \"Revenge of the Alien\" and \"The Bride of Bizarro\". Other comic book writers that contributed to the series include Denny O'Neil, Cary Bates, J. M. DeMatteis and Mark Evanier.\n\nClark Kent/Superboy attends the Siegel School of Journalism at Shuster University in Shusterville, Florida – names which reference Superman's creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nThe first season of the series, which began airing in October 1988, focused on Superboy/Clark Kent (John Haymes Newton), his childhood friend and love interest Lana Lang (Stacy Haiduk) and his college roommate T.J. White (Jim Calvert), son of \"Daily Planet\" editor Perry White. Scott James Wells played Superboy's nemesis Lex Luthor. Clark's adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, were portrayed by Stuart Whitman and Salome Jens, respectively.\n\nIn an interview with \"Boys' Life\" prior to the show's debut, Newton spoke of the importance of overall character development and his focus would both be on Superboy and Clark Kent. \"When Clark is not Superboy; he ought to be a well-rounded individual. I think people have gotten tired of seeing the nerdy Clark after four movies.\"\n\nThirteen episodes were initially filmed for Season 1, beginning with \"Countdown to Nowhere\". This episode featured Superboy's first public appearance as he prevents a group of saboteurs from selling a powerful laser weapon developed by the U.S. government to an arms dealer. \"Countdown to Nowhere\" aired in two versions: an \"uncut\" version in which the story plays in the present day and a second version in which the main story is introduced as a flashback through two additional scenes with Lana, Clark and T.J. The second version contained some scenes cut from the main story in order to fit the flashback lead-ins into the episode. This episode is the first episode of the series chronologically, but was the fifth one that was aired in most markets. It also appears as the fifth episode on the first season DVD set. The first season's story editor was Fred Freiberger, who also scripted a few episodes.\n\nThe first thirteen episodes of \"Superboy\" were rather crude compared to later episodes. The producers, not sure whether any additional episodes would be ordered, did their best to save money on the first thirteen. As a result, the special effects are a bit rougher and the episodes have a grittier, real-world feel to them. This brought about more character-oriented stories and stories with more ordinary villains like drug dealers and crime bosses.\n\nAfter thirteen additional episodes were ordered for the first season, special effects improved and the show took on a more professional look. More fantastic enemies were introduced, such as an unnamed gaseous alien, who could possess the bodies of others in \"The Alien Solution\", a life-force vampire in \"Succubus\" and long-time Superman villain Mister Mxyzptlk (guest star Michael J. Pollard) in \"Meet Mr. Mxyzptlk\".\n\nSuperboy's nemesis, Lex Luthor, was introduced in \"The Jewel of Techechal\" (the first episode broadcast) as Clark's classmate at Shuster University. This version of Luthor was more interested in fixing basketball games and humiliating Superboy than anything else. But the season one finale, \"Luthor Unleashed\", completely changed his character. This episode adapted Lex Luthor's silver age comic book origin, in which Superboy rescues Lex from a lab accident that causes him to lose all of his hair, becoming the familiar bald villain Superman fans have come to recognize. Luthor blames Superboy for his hair loss and gains a new, more intense hatred for the Boy of Steel. From this point on in the series, Luthor is determined to destroy Superboy, rather than just humiliate him.\n\nIn the second season, drastic changes took place. The producers of the show were not enamored of Newton's portrayal of Superboy. He was replaced by Gerard Christopher in the lead role. A new direction was made this season with the second season's stories guided by Executive Story Consultants Mark Jones and Cary Bates.\n\nScott Wells was also replaced as Lex Luthor by Sherman Howard. The change in Luthor's appearance was explained in the second season opener \"With This Ring, I Thee Kill\". The two-part episode revealed Luthor had plastic surgery to assume the appearance of Warren Eckworth, the wealthy inventor of the \"Superboy Gun\", which Luthor believed could kill Superboy. The character of T.J. White was written out of the series (he went to work for the \"Daily Planet\") and Andy McCalister, portrayed by Ilan Mitchell-Smith, became Clark's new roommate. Andy was very different from T.J. and was constantly looking to make money with his get-rich-quick schemes. He also flirted with Lana frequently and his advances were always refused, though Lana did consider Andy a friend.\n\nThe villains were amped up in the second season, as additional comic book characters were introduced to the series, many of them appearing for the first time in live-action. Metallo (Michael Callan), Bizarro (Barry Meyers) as well as the Yellow Peri appeared in the second season and Mister Mxyzptlk (Pollard) made a return appearance. Gilbert Gottfried appeared in two episodes as a nasty, wisecracking criminal genius named \"Nick Knack\" who used toys to commit crimes (a reference to the Toyman). Another character was a dhampir who found a way through a serum to gain human abilities such as repelling his craving for blood and gaining a tolerance for sunlight. Thus, he became a friend of both Superboy and Lana but would become villainous if doing without the serum for too long. Philip Michael Thomas also made an appearance as a medieval alchemist who survived into modern times in order to battle a sorcerer spreading plague, and aided Superboy when he was infected by said disease. The episode \"Superboy... Rest in Peace\" featured guest star Betsy Russell, who was reunited with series star Gerard Christopher for the first time since the two had worked together previously in the 1985 movie \"Tomboy\". Also notable is the guest star appearance of former James Bond actor George Lazenby and Bond girl actress Britt Ekland as aliens disguised as Superboy's Kryptonian father and mother, Jor-El and Lara, in two episodes, \"Abandon Earth\" and \"Escape to Earth\".\n\nWith the third season, the series saw more changes. The show's title officially became \"The Adventures of Superboy\" and the setting shifted from Shuster University to The Bureau for Extra-Normal Matters in Capitol City, Florida, where Clark and Lana were interns. The Bureau is depicted as a government agency which investigates paranormal activities and aliens, including Superboy (this format change pre-dates the concept of the television series \"The X-Files\").\n\nAndy McCalister was dropped from the series, though Ilan Mitchell-Smith would make a final guest appearance in the episode \"Special Effects\", which explained his disappearance by saying that Andy went to intern at a movie studio. The new supporting cast consisted of Clark and Lana's co-worker at the Bureau, Matt Ritter (Peter Jay Fernandez) and the Bureau chief C. Dennis Jackson (Robert Levine).\n\nThe tone of the series changed dramatically as darker stories were produced and the overall look of the series took on many characteristics of film noir. A few journalists at the time suggested that this darker look was largely due to the success of Tim Burton's \"Batman\" movie from a year prior. Many stories dealt with more mature themes, a change new producers Julia Pistor and Gerard Christopher implemented. In \"Rebirth\", Superboy is confronted with the possibility that he may have accidentally taken a human life and gives up his Superboy identity in guilt. \"Carnival\" shows a satanic individual named 'Deville' trying to acquire Superboy's eternal soul by tempting him to give in and kill a man who is implied to be a rapist. \"Mindscape\" deals with Superboy's deepest fears as an alien life-form brings those fears to life in Superboy's nightmares while simultaneously draining his life energy. \"Roads Not Taken\" shows the different paths Superboy's life may have taken, as Superboy travels to alternate earths where his life is very different. He meets a version of himself who killed Luthor in a fit of rage and another who has become a despotic ruler of earth. The alternate version of Superboy who took Luthor's life was shown wearing a black leather jacket and sunglasses which bears some resemblance to the Conner Kent version of Superboy as he first appeared in the \"Death of Superman\" storyline. The third season ended with the two-part episode \"The Road to Hell\" with former TV Tarzan Ron Ely guest-starring as an adult, retired Man of Steel from an alternate reality.\n\nThe fourth season maintained the darker look and feel of the third one and was the first in which no major cast changes took place. Noel Neill and Jack Larson (who portrayed Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen on the 1950s TV series \"Adventures of Superman\") made guest appearances in the episode \"Paranoia\" as employees of the Bureau for Extra-Normal Matters. The trend of more mature stories also continued in episodes such as \"To Be Human\", in which Bizarro becomes human, only to be forced to give up his humanity to save Superboy's life and \"Into the Mystery\", in which a mystical, ghostly woman, apparently an angel of death, leads Superboy to his dying aunt's bedside. A memorable Luthor tale, \"Know Thine Enemy\", appeared in this season, featuring Superboy re-living Luthor's tortured memories of childhood via \"psychodisk\" while Luthor threatened to destroy all life on Earth.\n\nDC Comics published a tie-in comic book series during the TV show's run, launching the comic during the TV series' second season. \"Superboy\" (Volume 2) is different from any other Superman or Superboy titles in that it is set in the continuity of the \"Superboy\" television series, as opposed to the regular DC Universe. Its intent was to explore some of the unseen tales and events that the TV series could not. The series originally carried the cover title \"Superboy: The Comic Book\" with issue #1 having a photo cover with the show's stars Gerard Christopher and Stacy Haiduk (dated Feb. 1990), although the title in the indicia was simply \"Superboy\". After issue #11, the series changed its cover title to \"The Adventures of Superboy\" as the TV series itself had changed titles starting with season three, and the change was reflected in the comic book's indicia beginning with #18. The series was published monthly until it went bi-monthly for its final three issues, remained in publication for 22 issues to the end of 1991 (cover dated Feb. 1992), and a concluding one issue special in 1992.\n\nAlthough the \"Superboy\" series was still popular, the fourth season was to be its last. The finale was to be titled \"Obituary For a Superhero\" and Superboy was supposed to appear to meet his demise at the hands of Lex Luthor in a cliffhanger ending. The intent of the Salkinds was to make a series of television movies, which would resolve the cliffhanger and see Superboy's return.\n\nAs this was going on, a new Superman television series was in development at Warner Bros. The film company had sold licenses to Alexander and Ilya for various Superman-related properties, most notable of which were the feature film series starring Christopher Reeve as Superman. While the first two films were successful, \"Superman III\" was a critical flop that barely made its budget back. The box office bomb \"Supergirl\" followed which had no domestic involvement from Warner or the Salkinds. After that, the Salkinds sold their movie license to The Cannon Group. Alexander and Ilya did retain their license for a television adaptation, and it was under that license that \"Superboy\" was developed. Utilizing a concept suggested by Peter R. Marino, Alexander produced the series and partnered with Viacom to distribute it.\n\nAs \"Superboy\" was being developed as a television series, a change in the Superman canon was going on at DC Comics. In 1986, as previously mentioned, John Byrne was tasked with revamping the franchise and decided to strip it down to its basics and start fresh. His plan of action was to retcon many parts of the Superman storyline, which included removing Superboy from his history altogether. Byrne completed this task by 1988, but since there was no other Superman-based production active at the time it remained confined to the comics.\n\nHowever, Warner Bros. was about to enter the process of developing plans for a new Superman TV series. In 1991, Jenette Kahn, president of DC Comics, looked to Deborah Joy LeVine and Les Moonves of the parent company's television department to come up with a concept. Using the new characteristics Byrne established, Warner Bros. piqued the interest of ABC for their new series, which was to be titled \"\".\n\nDespite this, Warner Bros.' licensing agreement with the Salkinds was still in force, meaning Alexander and Ilya could continue to use any Superman character in their own production. Once ABC decided to buy the new Superman series, the Salkinds were served with notice that Warner Bros. was ending the licensing arrangement and all of the intellectual property rights Alexander and Ilya were still in possession of were to be returned to Warner.\n\nAlthough the program was coming to an end at the end of the 1991-92 season anyway, the action by Warner Bros. put an end to the continuation films that were planned following \"Obituary for a Superhero\". The writers thus were forced to write a final episode, a two-parter titled \"Rites of Passage\", and turn \"Obituary for a Superhero\" into a regular episode which did not feature the cliffhanger ending. The series concluded in May 1992 with the conclusion of \"Rites of Passage\". It would be another year before \"Lois & Clark\" premiered on ABC.\n\nThe Salkinds decided to challenge Warner Bros. in court over the rights to their \"Superboy\" series; a lengthy period of legal wrangling ended with a settlement. The terms of the settlement, which is still binding as of 2014, gave Warner Bros. full control of the \"Superman\" franchise's films and television series (with the exception of television distribution of \"Superman IV\", which was taken over by Paramount Pictures after its acquisition of the Cannon library of films and is now handled on Paramount’s behalf by Trifecta Entertainment and Media). Control of the \"Superboy\" television series is shared with both Ilya Salkind, who took over his father's share of the series when Alexander died in 1997, the Salkinds' corporate successor, StudioCanal, CBS Television Distribution, and Warner Bros.. Viacom retained its television distribution rights in the United States, which are now in the hands of its syndication successor CBS Television Distribution. Warner Bros. holds worldwide home media distribution rights and international television distribution rights for the series, but neither Viacom nor Warner Bros. has taken advantage of these rights and \"Superboy\" has yet to be rerun since its 1992 finale.\n\n\n\nSome time after the series' cancellation, there was a dispute over what rights to the character the Salkinds actually owned. For a time this prevented any official home video release of the series. Between 1992 and 2006 the only way to see \"Superboy\" in the United States was by ordering bootleg VHS and DVD copies of the series sold on eBay and other websites. The audio and video quality of these copies was varied.\n\nIn 1999, Gerard Christopher began offering three VHS tapes of the series created from his personal master tapes (Christopher has masters of all of the episodes he starred in, Seasons 2–4). Each video tape featured four episodes (which were selected episodes from Seasons 3 and 4) and was sold on his then former website for a price of $25–$30 US. A fourth VHS video tape was released by Christopher in 2002. Christopher not only sold these video tapes on his website by mail order, but also sold them at personal appearances when attending various comic book conventions and shows. He had offered other \"Superboy\" merchandise for sale, such as autographed photos, and at one time, even episode scripts. All merchandise from Christopher were also personally autographed.\n\nIn response to overwhelming fan demand, from a private email sent by Christopher (only to the fans who had previously ordered merchandise from his website) , he decided to offer all \"Superboy\" episodes on DVD, offering a complete Season 2 set on DVD in early June 2004 and planned to sell complete sets of Seasons 3 and 4 in the future. \"The Adventures of Superboy: Season 2 Episodes\" DVD set consisted of three discs (in DVD-R format), was produced by Christopher himself, and sold for a price of $159.00 US (due to their past loyalty fans who had previously ordered merchandise from Christopher's website were able to pre-purchase the Season 2 DVD set at the reduced price of $129.00 US for a limited time before June 30, 2004 as this offer was by invitation only). The latter two seasons were planned to be sold at a reduced cost. Tapes and DVDs sold by Christopher were the best quality copies of the series available, since they were made from master tapes, rather than from off-air recordings like all other bootleg copies.\n\nWhen Warner Home Video announced the official release of Season 1, Christopher announced that his self-produced DVD sets would no longer be available on his website in 2005, with the planned DVD releases for Seasons 3 and 4 cancelled.\n\nIn an interview for the webpage supermanhomepage.com, Salkind revealed that the legal battle between the three companies involved in the series' production (Viacom, Warner Bros. and the Salkinds) was the reason the show was not re-run on television or released to home video. This dispute was settled circa 2005, allowing the series to be released on DVD.\n\nThe DVD set includes a behind-the-scenes featurette with new interviews with first-season Clark Kent/Superboy actor John Haymes Newton, actors Stacy Haiduk and James Calvert, creative/executive producer Ilya Salkind as well as director David Nutter. The DVD also features the screen test of John Haymes Newton and audio commentaries by Ilya Salkind and Newton on two key episodes (\"Revenge of the Alien\" Part 2 and \"Meet Mr. Mxyzptlk\"). The DVD was released in advance of the film \"Superman Returns\".\n\nOn December 5, 2012, after a six-and-a-half years gap, Warner Bros. announced they would release the complete second season of \"Superboy\" on DVD via its Warner Archive Collection, which occurred on December 11, 2012. This is a manufacture-on-demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner's online store and only in the US, as well as Amazon.com through their CreateSpace service, which ships globally.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Warner Bros. stated that they would release the complete third season of \"Superboy\", which occurred on July 16, 2013, via MOD, through the Warner Archive, as well as Amazon.com through their CreateSpace service, which ships globally.\n\nOn October 26, 2013, the fourth season was listed at warnerarchive.com for an October 29, 2013 release date. For a limited time, copies of the DVD set were autographed by series star Gerard Christopher; the non-autographed version becomes available upon exhaustion of the autographed inventory. It is also available from Amazon.com through their CreateSpace service, which ships globally.\n\nAll four seasons were made available in 2018 for streaming on DC Universe (streaming service), a paid streaming subscription specializing in DC Comics-related content. As the original series was shot on videotape, these episodes are presented in standard definition at their original 4:3 display ratio.\n\n\n"}

Pope John XXIII named him Cardinal Secretary of State and, in this position the most prominent member of the Roman Curia in Vatican City.\n\nHe attended the Angelo Braschi School and entered the Pontifical Roman Seminary in 1903 from which he graduated with honours in philosophy and theology. 21 September 1912 he was ordained a priest. He accepted a call to teach liturgy and theology at the Roman Seminary and the \"Collegio Urbano\" of the Propaganda Fide. In 1923, he was nominated by Pope Pius XI to be general assistant of the Catholic Action movement. In 1925, the Pope nominated him to a second organisation, \"Societa della Gioventu Cattolica Italiana\". From 1921 onward, he worked as well in the Congregation of Ordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs where he was named Sustituto in 1929 and Secretary in 1937. With Giovanni Battista Montini, he was the main assistant to Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli until 1939.\n\nAfter his election as Pope Pius XII, Pacelli appointed Luigi Maglione as his successor as Cardinal Secretary of State. Maglione did not exercise the influence of his predecessor, who as Pope continued his close relation with Monsignori Giovanni Battista Montini and Tardini. After the death of Maglione in 1944, Pius left the position vacant and named Tardini head of its foreign section and Montini head of the internal section. Tardini and Montini continued serving there until 1952, when Pius XII decided to elevate both of them into the College of Cardinals an honour which both turned down. When Tardini thanked him for not appointing him, Pius XII replied with a smile: \n\nIn November 1952, he was named Pro-Secretary of the State for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs by Pope Pius XII, essentially co-serving as functional Secretary of State with Giovanni Battista Montini, who became Pro-Secretary of State for Ordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs. In addition they were granted the privilege to wear Episcopal Insignia. Tardini continued in that position until the death of Pius XII.\n\nTardini loved children and \"adopted\" the orphans of Villa Nazareth, for whom he organised recognition and assistance. Televised audiences with Pope Pius XII, and visits of Pope John XXIII and high-ranking foreign dignitaries, all arranged by Tardini, facilitated fundraising for the needy children.\n\nAfter the death of Pope Pius on 9 October 1958, Tardini, though not a cardinal and not even a bishop, was prominently mentioned as a possible successor because of his familiarity with and closeness to Pius XII. Instead, Tardini was named Secretary of State by the newly elected Pope John XXIII, filling the previous vacancy. Having declined being made Cardinal by Pius XII in 1953, he accepted the red hat in the consistory of 15 December 1958 with the title of Cardinal-Deacon of \"S. Apollinare alle Terme Neroniane-Alessandrine\". He was ordained as a titular archbishop later that month.\n\nTardini did not seek the honour of the appointment. On the very night of the election or as the first papal appointment next morning (biographers differ on this) Tardini was asked to see the new Pope John XXIII, who asked him to become his Secretary of State. He went reluctantly:\n\n\nAs Secretary of State, Tardini broke the taboo on discussing Vatican finances in October 1959, holding a press conference with Vatican-accredited journalists during a pay dispute with Vatican employees. On 20 January 1959, Pope John summoned Cardinal Tardini to float the idea of an Ecumenical Council. It would involve all bishops of every rite. Tardini's response was positive to the point that the Pope was surprised. John XXIII later referred to this discussion as the decisive moment for his decision to hold an ecumenical council. He assisted in the preparation of the Council giving at times his own interpretation of the forthcoming epochal event. Reportedly, he tried to resign several times for health reasons but was asked to stay on by the disarmingly witty John XXIII .\n\nTardini died in Rome on 30 July 1961 of a massive heart attack. He was buried in the Carmel at Vetralla. At the first anniversary of his death, Pope John XXIII left the Vatican to pay his respects at his burial site.\n\n\n\n"}

Collins\n\nJohn William \"Jack\" Collins (September 23, 1912 – December 2, 2001) was an American chess master, author, and teacher.\n\nCollins was born in Newburgh, New York. \"His father, John Thomas Collins, was a flutist and piccolo player who was frequently in John Philip Sousa's orchestra. His mother, Carolyn LaSears Collins, was a homemaker.\" Collins was confined to a wheelchair due to \"a birth injury\".\n\nWhen he was in his teens, Collins met Frederick Huhn, the family's 80-year-old German landlord of their home at 69 Hawthorne Street in Brooklyn, NY. Frederick taught Collins how to play chess. From there, Collins started reading chess books, eventually amassing \"a library of over six hundred.\"\n\nCollins tried to join the Marshall Chess Club, but found the players to be too strong, and the location too far away for him to travel to. Hence, he started teaching \"the other boys on the block\" and the Hawthorne Chess Club was founded.\n\nCollins wrote to the local newspapers and \"obtained the names and addresses of several high-school teams in the metropolitan area.\" This led to inter-club matches between Collins' team and the high-school teams, mostly played out of Collins' living room.\n\nEventually Collins founded the Brooklyn Chess League. He later moved to 91 Lenox Road where the club gradually changed from a chess league to a casual meeting place for chess celebrities to meet. Guests and visitors included Irving Chernev, Hermann Helms, and Irving Riskie.\n\nCollins won the 1943 United States Correspondence Championship, defeating Dr. Erich W. Marchand in a final playoff match. Collins won the 1952 New York State Championship, ahead of Max Pavey, Anthony Santasiere, James Sherwin, and Frank Anderson. He won the Marshall Chess Club championship in 1953 and was soon thereafter ranked number 17 in the country. Collins was a renowned chess teacher.\n\nThere has been a long-held belief that Collins was Fischer's teacher and coach, as well as a teacher and coach for William Lombardy, Robert Byrne, Donald Byrne, Raymond Weinstein, Salvatore Matera, and Lewis Cohen. Some have gone as far as to call Collins \"the Yoda of American chess\", while others refer to Collins as Fischer's \"mentor\", not his teacher or coach. Collins himself states he did not teach Bobby Fischer, Robert Byrne, William Lombardy, or Donald Byrne, yet taught Raymond Weinstein, Sal Matera, and Lewis Cohen.\n\nLombardy says of Collins as a chess teacher and coach:Jack Collins was not in any way capable of teaching me, the Byrne Brothers, Raymond Weinstein, let alone Bobby Fischer. All had entered his home in friendship and were already superior masters, far past the ability of Collins to impart anything but trivial knowledge...I cannot imagine even today that anyone could consider that Collins had the strength of knowledge to coach the champion that Bobby already was by the time he reached Collins apartment! Somehow the myth of Collins' professional skills persists. Back then because Collins was in a wheelchair, I did not desire to burst his bubble... [but that] with my misplaced sympathy for Collins gone, I attempt to correct and inform.\n\n\n"}

As chief legal advisor to the Cabinet, Blackwell was involved in the prosecution of Roger Casement, and authorised the circulation of his disputed \"Black Diaries\".\n\nBlackwell was born on 6 June 1868 in St Andrews, Fife, Scotland, the youngest son of Surgeon-Major James Hay Blackwell, H.E.I.C.S., and his wife, Eliza Jane Robertson (a daughter of Andrew Robertson (d. 1868), of the Madras Civil Service, a member of a Scots gentry family; from whom Blackwell derived descent from the Royal Houses of Plantagenet, Bruce, and Stewart ) of 3, Gillespie terrace, St Andrews. Blackwell was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond, where, as captain of school, he early displayed leadership skills, combining these with sporting prowess, as captain of the 1st XI (Cricket), 1st XV (Rugby), and of the golf team.\n\nDestined for the legal profession, Blackwell was called to the Bar from the Inner Temple in 1892. Subsequently, he spent his career in Whitehall as a member of the British Civil Service, rising to senior appointments, first as Assistant Secretary at the Home Department from 1906 to 1913, and then as Legal Assistant Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office from 1913 until his retirement in 1933. He was awarded CB in the 1911 Coronation Honours.\n\nAs chief legal advisor to the Cabinet, Blackwell was involved in the prosecution of Roger Casement, and authorised the circulation of his disputed \"Black Diaries\", advising the Cabinet in July 1916:\n\nIn 1918, due to worries over the large number of firearms left in private hands following World War I, and the concern that they would be used by \"\"savage or semi-civilised tribesmen in outlying parts of the British Empire\"\" or by an \"\"anarchist or intellectual malcontent of the great cities whose weapons are the bomb and the automatic pistol.\"\", a \"Committee on Firearms Control\" was struck with Blackwell as its chairman. The report it issued recommended \"\"stringent regulation\"\" of rifles and small arms as \"\"the number of persons who can urge any reasonable ground for possession of a revolver or pistol is extremely small\" [and] \"the danger attending the indiscriminate possession of such weapons is obvious\"\", conclusions which led to the passage of the Firearms Act 1920.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Blackwell's continued interest in legal matters was shown by his 1934 appointment as chairman of the statutory committee of Britain's Pharmaceutical Society, to which he had been elected an honorary member in 1928. He exercised that position until 1939. Among other interests, he was a first-class golfer who captained The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1933. He served as the first president of The Civil Service Golfing Society from 1922 until his death. In 1924, the Club instituted \"The Sir Ernley Blackwell Trophy\", which it still awards. He was also a member of the Zoological Society from 1914. His brother, Edward Blackwell, who was also a skilled golfer, placed second in the 1904 Amateur Championship.\n\nBlackwell was married at the age of 69 to Kitty, \"Lady Blackwell\", of 7, Hay Hill, London, W.1, who survived him. There were no children of this union.\n\nBlackwell died at Radlett, Hertfordshire, England on 21 September 1941, aged 73. He was buried in the Blackwell family grave in St Andrews Eastern Cemetery, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.\n"}

{"id": "2222635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222635", "title": "Atmospheric electricity", "text": "Atmospheric electricity\n\nAtmospheric electricity is the study of electrical charges in the Earth's atmosphere (or that of another planet). The movement of charge between the Earth's surface, the atmosphere, and the ionosphere is known as the global atmospheric electrical circuit. Atmospheric electricity is an interdisciplinary topic with a long history, involving concepts from electrostatics, atmospheric physics, meteorology and Earth science.\n\nThunderstorms act as a giant battery in the atmosphere, charging up the electrosphere to about 400,000 volts with respect to the surface. This sets up an electric field throughout the atmosphere, which decreases with increase in altitude. Atmospheric ions created by cosmic rays and natural radioactivity move in the electric field, so a very small current flows through the atmosphere, even away from thunderstorms. Near the surface of the earth, the magnitude of the field is on average around 100 V/m.\n\nAtmospheric electricity involves both thunderstorms, which create lightning bolts to rapidly discharge huge amounts of atmospheric charge stored in storm clouds, and the continual electrification of the air due to ionization from cosmic rays and natural radioactivity, which ensure that the atmosphere is never quite neutral.\n\nSparks drawn from electrical machines and from Leyden jars suggested to the early experimenters, Hauksbee, Newton, Wall, Nollet, and Gray, that lightning was caused by electric discharges. In 1708, Dr. William Wall was one of the first to observe that spark discharges resembled miniature lightning, after observing the sparks from a charged piece of amber.\n\nBenjamin Franklin's experiments showed that electrical phenomena of the atmosphere were not fundamentally different from those produced in the laboratory, by listing many similarities between electricity and lightning. By 1749, Franklin observed lightning to possess almost all the properties observable in electrical machines.\n\nIn July 1750, Franklin hypothesized that electricity could be taken from clouds via a tall metal aerial with a sharp point. Before Franklin could carry out his experiment, in 1752 Thomas-François Dalibard erected a iron rod at Marly-la-Ville, near Paris, drawing sparks from a passing cloud. With ground-insulated aerials, an experimenter could bring a grounded lead with an insulated wax handle close to the aerial, and observe a spark discharge from the aerial to the grounding wire. In May 1752, Dalibard affirmed that Franklin's theory was correct.\n\nAround June 1752, Franklin reportedly performed his famous kite experiment. The kite experiment was repeated by Romas, who drew from a metallic string sparks long, and by Cavallo, who made many important observations on atmospheric electricity. Lemonnier (1752) also reproduced Franklin's experiment with an aerial, but substituted the ground wire with some dust particles (testing attraction). He went on to document the \"fair weather condition\", the clear-day electrification of the atmosphere, and its diurnal variation. Beccaria (1775) confirmed Lemonnier's diurnal variation data and determined that the atmosphere's charge polarity was positive in fair weather. Saussure (1779) recorded data relating to a conductor's induced charge in the atmosphere. Saussure's instrument (which contained two small spheres suspended in parallel with two thin wires) was a precursor to the electrometer. Saussure found that the atmospheric electrification under clear weather conditions had an annual variation, and that it also varied with height. In 1785, Coulomb discovered the electrical conductivity of air. His discovery was contrary to the prevailing thought at the time, that the atmospheric gases were insulators (which they are to some extent, or at least not very good conductors when not ionized). Erman (1804) theorized that the Earth was negatively charged, and Peltier (1842) tested and confirmed Erman's idea.\n\nSeveral researchers contributed to the growing body of knowledge about atmospheric electrical phenomena. Francis Ronalds began observing the potential gradient and air-earth currents around 1810, including making continuous automated recordings. He resumed his research in the 1840s as the inaugural Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory, where the first extended and comprehensive dataset of electrical and associated meteorological parameters was created. He also supplied his equipment to other facilities around the world with the goal of delineating atmospheric electricity on a global scale. Kelvin's new water dropper collector and divided-ring electrometer were introduced at Kew Observatory in the 1860s, and atmospheric electricity remained a speciality of the observatory until its closure. For high-altitude measurements, kites were once used, and weather balloons or aerostats are still used, to lift experimental equipment into the air. Early experimenters even went aloft themselves in hot-air balloons.\n\nHoffert (1888) identified individual lightning downward strokes using early cameras. Elster and Geitel, who also worked on thermionic emission, proposed a theory to explain thunderstorms' electrical structure (1885) and, later, discovered atmospheric radioactivity (1899) from the existence of positive and negative ions in the atmosphere. Pockels (1897) estimated lightning current intensity by analyzing lightning flashes in basalt (c. 1900) and studying the left-over magnetic fields caused by lightning. Discoveries about the electrification of the atmosphere via sensitive electrical instruments and ideas on how the Earth's negative charge is maintained were developed mainly in the 20th century, with CTR Wilson playing an important part. Current research on atmospheric electricity focuses mainly on lightning, particularly high-energy particles and transient luminous events, and the role of non-thunderstorm electrical processes in weather and climate.\n\nAtmospheric electricity is always present, and during fine weather away from thunderstorms, the air above the surface of Earth is positively charged, while the Earth's surface charge is negative. It can be understood in terms of a difference of potential between a point of the Earth's surface, and a point somewhere in the air above it. Because the atmospheric electric field is negatively directed in fair weather, the convention is to refer to the potential gradient, which has the opposite sign and is about 100 V/m at the surface. The potential gradient in most locations is much lower than this value because it is an average of the charge built up by every thunderstorm and atmospheric disturbance around the globe. There is a weak conduction current of atmospheric ions moving in the atmospheric electric field, about 2 picoAmperes per square metre, and the air is weakly conductive due to the presence of these atmospheric ions.\n\nGlobal daily cycles in the atmospheric electric field, with a minimum around 03 UT and peaking roughly 16 hours later, were researched by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the 20th century. This Carnegie curve variation has been described as \"the fundamental electrical heartbeat of the planet\".\n\nEven away from thunderstorms, atmospheric electricity can be highly variable, but, generally, the electric field is enhanced in fogs and dust whereas the atmospheric electrical conductivity is diminished.\n\nThe atmospheric potential gradient leads to an ion flow from the positively charged atmosphere to the negatively charged earth surface. Over a flat field on a day with clear skies, the atmospheric potential gradient is approximately 120 V/m. Objects protruding these fields, e.g. flowers and trees, can increase the electric field strength to several kilovolts per meter. These near-surface electrostatic forces are detected by organisms such as the bumblebee to navigate to flowers and the spider to initiate dispersal by ballooning. The atmospheric potential gradient is also thought to affect sub-surface electro-chemistry and microbial processes.\n\nThe electrosphere layer (from tens of kilometers above the surface of the earth to the ionosphere) has a high electrical conductivity and is essentially at a constant electric potential. The ionosphere is the inner edge of the magnetosphere and is the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. (Photoionization is a physical process in which a photon is incident on an atom, ion or molecule, resulting in the ejection of one or more electrons.)\n\nThe Earth, and almost all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from protons to iron and larger nuclei derived sources outside our solar system. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an air shower of secondary ionising radiation, including X-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, and electrons. Ionization from this secondary radiation ensures that the atmosphere is weakly conductive, and that the slight current flow from these ions over the Earth's surface balances the current flow from thunderstorms. Ions have characteristic parameters such as mobility, lifetime, and generation rate that vary with altitude.\n\nThe potential difference between the ionosphere and the Earth is maintained by thunderstorms, with lightning strikes delivering negative charges from the atmosphere to the ground. \nCollisions between ice and soft hail (graupel) inside cumulonimbus clouds causes separation of positive and negative charges within the cloud, essential for the generation of lightning. How lightning initially forms is still a matter of debate: Scientists have studied root causes ranging from atmospheric perturbations (wind, humidity, and atmospheric pressure) to the impact of solar wind and energetic particles.\n\nAn average bolt of lightning carries a negative electric current of 40 kiloamperes (kA) (although some bolts can be up to 120 kA), and transfers a charge of five coulombs and energy of 500 MJ, or enough energy to power a 100-watt lightbulb for just under two months. The voltage depends on the length of the bolt, with the dielectric breakdown of air being three million volts per meter, and lightning bolts often being several hundred meters long. However, lightning leader development is not a simple matter of dielectric breakdown, and the ambient electric fields required for lightning leader propagation can be a few orders of magnitude less than dielectric breakdown strength. Further, the potential gradient inside a well-developed return-stroke channel is on the order of hundreds of volts per meter or less due to intense channel ionization, resulting in a true power output on the order of megawatts per meter for a vigorous return-stroke current of 100 kA .\n\nIf the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated. In an average thunderstorm, the energy released amounts to about 10,000,000 kilowatt-hours (3.6 joule), which is equivalent to a 20-kiloton nuclear warhead. A large, severe thunderstorm might be 10 to 100 times more energetic.\n\n\"St. Elmo's Fire\" is an electrical phenomenon in which luminous plasma is created by a coronal discharge originating from a grounded object. Ball lightning is often erroneously identified as St. Elmo's Fire, whereas they are separate and distinct phenomena. Although referred to as \"fire\", St. Elmo's Fire is, in fact, plasma, and is observed, usually during a thunderstorm, at the tops of trees, spires or other tall objects, or on the heads of animals, as a brush or star of light.\n\nCorona is caused by the electric field around the object in question ionizing the air molecules, producing a faint glow easily visible in low-light conditions. Approximately 1,000 – 30,000 volts per centimetre is required to induce St. Elmo's Fire; however, this is dependent on the geometry of the object in question. Sharp points tend to require lower voltage levels to produce the same result because electric fields are more concentrated in areas of high curvature, thus discharges are more intense at the end of pointed objects. St. Elmo's Fire and normal sparks both can appear when high electrical voltage affects a gas. St. Elmo's fire is seen during thunderstorms when the ground below the storm is electrically charged, and there is high voltage in the air between the cloud and the ground. The voltage tears apart the air molecules and the gas begins to glow. The nitrogen and oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere causes St. Elmo's Fire to fluoresce with blue or violet light; this is similar to the mechanism that causes neon signs to glow.\n\nThe Schumann resonances are a set of spectrum peaks in the extremely low frequency (ELF) portion of the Earth's electromagnetic field spectrum. Schumann resonance is due to the space between the surface of the Earth and the conductive ionosphere acting as a waveguide. The limited dimensions of the earth cause this waveguide to act as a resonant cavity for electromagnetic waves. The cavity is naturally excited by energy from lightning strikes.\n\nAtmospheric charges can cause undesirable, dangerous, and potentially lethal charge potential buildup in suspended electric wire power distribution systems. Bare wires suspended in the air spanning many kilometers and isolated from the ground can collect very large stored charges at high voltage, even when there is no thunderstorm or lightning occurring. This charge will seek to discharge itself through the path of least insulation, which can occur when a person reaches out to activate a power switch or to use an electric device.\n\nTo dissipate atmospheric charge buildup, one side of the electrical distribution system is connected to the earth at many points throughout the distribution system, as often as on every support pole. The one earth-connected wire is commonly referred to as the \"protective earth\", and provides path for the charge potential to dissipate without causing damage, and provides redundancy in case any one of the ground paths is poor due to corrosion or poor ground conductivity. The additional electric grounding wire that carries no power serves a secondary role, providing a high-current short-circuit path to rapidly blow fuses and render a damaged device safe, rather than have an ungrounded device with damaged insulation become \"electrically live\" via the grid power supply, and hazardous to touch.\n\nEach transformer in an alternating current distribution grid segments the grounding system into a new separate circuit loop. These separate grids must also be grounded on one side to prevent charge buildup within them relative to the rest of the system, and which could cause damage from charge potentials discharging across the transformer coils to the other grounded side of the distribution network.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

To the north of Lynchestia was the region of Deuriopus, while Paeonia was to the northeast, Pelagonia bordered on the east, Emathia and Almopia to the southeast, and Orestia, Eordaia and the Haliacmon river at some distance to the south.\n\nThe wealthy kings of Lynkestis traced their origins to the Bacchiad kings that were expelled from Corinth in the 7th century BC. During the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) Arrhabaeus, the king of Lyncestis, waged war against Perdiccas II of Macedon (r. 451–413 BC) at the Battle of Lyncestis in 423 BC. According to Strabo, Irra was the daughter of Arrhabaeus, and that his granddaughter was Eurydice, the mother of Philip II.\n\nIn Roman times, the Via Egnatia crossed the area and there were several Roman stations in it.\n\n\n"}

While there, Carter meets stage performer Geneviève while Lee is tricked by mob assassin Jasmine, who claims to have information about Shy Shen, though Carter saves him from being killed. The pair try to escape, but are ultimately captured by Kenji's men. Kenji offers to let them live if they leave Paris, but Lee refuses and following a short struggle, he and Carter successfully escape. The duo recuperate at a hotel, where Lee reveals his relationship with Kenji and decides to continue alone. A disillusioned Carter leaves, but recomposes himself when he spots and follows Geneviève. Meanwhile, Reynard meets Lee and reveals that Shy Shen is not a person, but a list of Triad leaders and that Geneviève is Han's informant with access to the list.\n\nAfter locating Geneviève and saving her from an assassination attempt, the two flee to their hotel. They are attacked by Jasmine, but George rescues them out of a newfound admiration for Americans. Geneviève reveals to Lee and Carter that the Triad leaders' names were tattooed on the back of her head and that she will be beheaded if the Triads capture her. When Lee and Carter bring Geneviève to Reynard, they discover he was working with the Triads the entire time. Kenji calls to inform Lee that he has captured Soo Yung and demands he turn over Geneviève.\n\nLee arrives at the Eiffel Tower to make the exchange, with Carter disguised as Geneviève. Kenji challenges Lee to a sword fight, during which the two fall into a safety net. After Kenji's sword cuts the net, Lee tries to save him, but Kenji lets go, falling to his death. Meanwhile, Carter saves Soo Yung and beats Jasmine, who is killed after getting stuck in an elevator wheel. After escaping the remaining Triad members, Carter and Lee are confronted by Reynard, who threatens to kill Geneviève and frame them. However, George shoots Reynard from behind, killing him. As the police arrive, Revi tries to take credit for Lee and Carter's work, but they knock him out and leave with a victory dance.\n\n\nThe film was not screened in Chinese theaters in 2007, to make way for a larger variety of foreign films for that year, according to a business representative. (The quota for imported films is 20 each year.)\n\nLalo Schifrin composed the soundtrack, interspersed with hip hop and R&B music. Two soundtrack albums were released. An album of the hip hop and R&B music used was released on August 8, 2007, on CD and audio cassette from New Line Records and Columbia Records. Another, containing Schifrin's original compositions for the film was released on the Varèse Sarabande label.\n\n\"Rush Hour 3\" opened on August 10, 2007, and grossed $49.1 million in its opening weekend. Box Office Mojo noted:\n\nThe film grossed $258 million worldwide.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 18% based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Rush Hour 3\" is a tired rehash of earlier films, and a change of scenery can't hide a lack of new ideas.\" Todd Gilchrist of IGN movies said, \"A movie that not only depends on but demands you don't think in order to enjoy it.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 44 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nDesson Thomson of \"The Washington Post\", giving it three and a half stars out of five, said \"at the risk of eternal damnation on the Internet, I admit to laughing at — even feeling momentarily touched by — \"Rush Hour 3.\"\" Christian Toto of \"The Washington Times\" said, \"The Rush job should put the franchise down for good.\" Christopher Tookey of the \"Daily Mail\" said, \"Infecting this third movie is an extra, deeply unpleasant level of racism that we haven't seen before in the series.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" was slightly more positive giving the film two stars and saying, \"...once you realize it's only going to be so good, you settle back and enjoy that modest degree of goodness, which is at least not badness, and besides, if you're watching \"Rush Hour 3\", you obviously didn't have anything better to do, anyway.\" James Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, and said the movie was dull, uninspired and redundant.\n\nThe film was released on December 26, 2007, on DVD and Blu-ray. As of March 30, 2008, it made $80.75 million in Home Video rentals, making it the top rental of 2007. As of 2018, the film has grossed in American DVD sales.\n\nBecause of the film's box office success, director Brett Ratner and writer Jeff Nathanson are considering the production of a fourth film in the \"Rush Hour\" series. In the DVD audio commentary for \"Rush Hour 3\", Brett Ratner jokes that a \"Rush Hour 4\" could be released in the future. Ratner and Nathanson are exploring many concepts, including the use of the motion capture technique for the possible sequel and various film projects with Chan and Tucker. It has been reported that the fourth film may be set in Moscow.\n\nIn May 2011, in an interview with \"Vulture\", Ratner stated that the high cost of making a sequel is, \"why another \"Rush Hour\" probably won’t get made, either: It'd be too much to pay me, Chris [Tucker], and Jackie [Chan] to come back.\" In an interview on May 12, 2012, with \"The Arizona Republic\", Jackie Chan revealed that he was still planning on sequels to both \"Rush Hour\" and \"The Karate Kid\".\n\n\n"}

BGE earlier had created the holding company Constellation Energy in 1999. Constellation Energy was acquired by Exelon in 2012.\n\nHeadquartered in Baltimore, BGE provides service to more than 1.2 million electric customers and more than 650,000 natural gas customers in central Maryland. BGE employs 3,100 people in the state of Maryland, making the company one of the 15 largest private employers in the region.\n\nArtist / sculptor /museum operator Rembrandt Peale, (1778-1860), incorporated the \"Gas Light Company of Baltimore\" on June 17, 1816, after having exhibited gas lighting at his Holliday Street museum which was designed by famed local architect Robert Cary Long, Jr., built and opened in 1814 (between East Saratoga and East Lexington Streets - after a variety of uses including as Baltimore's City Hall, 1830-1875, later in 1931 to become the Municipal Museum of the City of Baltimore, popularly known once again as the Peale Museum into 1997) ; this was the first gas company in the Americas. The first streetlamp installed by the Gas Light Company of Baltimore stood at the corner of North Holliday and East Baltimore streets and was lit on February 7, 1817. By February 1818, only 28 gas-lit lamps existed. The Belvidere Theatre became the first public building to be lit using gas. Over the next decades the company experimented with piping, meters, and other mechanical technology. Baltimore committed to gas for municipal use, including the installation of gas service in all public markets between by 1851. Private subscription also steadily increased; by 1870, the company had 15,301 customers in Baltimore.\n\nIn 1955, the company rebranded to become Baltimore Gas and Electric, and began to recognize the acronym BGE sometime during the 1990s.\n\nBaltimore Gas and Electric is under common control with Maryland's second and third largest electric utilities after the Maryland Public Service Commission approved the acquisition of Pepco Holdings by Exelon in 2015. The acquisition of Pepco Holdings by Exelon was completed in 2016.\n\nBGE's electric service territory includes Baltimore City and all part of the Central Maryland counties including: Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Carroll, Harford, and Howard counties\n\nBGE is a member of two shared-crew networks in the southeast and mid-Atlantic regions, and frequently sends crews to help restore power to customers across those regions after severe weather events. The utility has dealt with major outages following meteorological events in the mid-Atlantic region, including the derecho of June 2012 and Hurricane Sandy in October of the same year. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, BGE restored power to more than 300,000 customers. The utility has proposed the construction and operation of microgrids, capable of generating and distributing electricity during larger outages to the centralized electrical grid; however, in July 2016, the Maryland Public Service Commission rejected BGE's request to construct microgrids.\n\nIn 2012, the company began replacing analog electric meters with smart meters to create a more cost effective smart grid system. In June 2016, the Maryland Public Service Commission turned down BGE's request for a rate increase to recover the $48 million cost of installing smart meters, granting them instead an increase that was only 50% of what the utility requested. The $2.80 rate increase went into effect in June 2016 and raised BGE customers’ average electric bill to $134.33 per month.\n\nIn October 2015, BGE filed a lawsuit against the city of Baltimore over the city's attempt to increase the fee it charges the utility for the use of its underground conduit system. In November 2016, BGE and the city settled the suit, with the utility accepting an increase to $24 million a year to use the city's long conduit system.\n\nBGE employees volunteered 25,000 hours of labor in 2013.\n\nThrough its Green Grants program, BGE offers grants of up to $10,000 to environmental non-profits in central Maryland. Since 2013, the company has awarded more than $1 million through the program. Past recipients include:\n\nIn 2015, BGE launched a program that allows customers to report osprey nests on or near electrical lines. The company then insulates or moves the nest to platforms. In the program's first year, learned of 23 nests built on electrical equipment.\n\nAs part of BGE's bicentennial celebration in 2016, the company added large, decorative murals to the three large storage tanks on its Spring Gardens campus in south Baltimore. BGE also partnered with the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation in 2016 to construct Eddie Murray Field in west Baltimore.\n"}

The complex also provided studio space for channel continuity. The site was run by the Pinewood Studios Group.\n\nPinewood Group's lease on Teddington Studios expired in 2014. The studios are being demolished to be turned into housing, with programmes made there having moved to other facilities. The studio buildings will be replaced by three modern apartment blocks and other smaller houses, with the view towards the river from Broom Road opened up.\n\nThe studio began in the early 20th century as film studios when stockbroker Henry Chinnery, owner of Weir House, Teddington, allowed filmmakers to use his greenhouse as a studio. Dedicated studio facilities were then built in the 1910s. The studio was greatly expanded by a partnership of filmmaker E. G. Norman and actor Henry Edwards, and renamed Teddington Film Studios Limited in 1931.\n\nAfter only one production, \"Stranglehold\" (1931), the studio was acquired by Warner Brothers to turn out so-called \"quota quickies\" – British-made films which fulfilled a legal quota (created by the Cinematograph Films Act 1927) before American-made films could be shown. Warner Bros.-First National continued to make US/UK coproductions at Teddington until \"The Dark Tower\" (1943). One Teddington Studios production \"Murder at Monte Carlo\" (1934) with Errol Flynn in his first major film role, is considered a lost film. The studio was seriously damaged in a V-2 attack in July 1944, in which Jack L. Warner's studio manager, and family member, Doc Salomon was killed while recording the attack.\n\nBy the 1950s the studio's fortunes had declined, but in 1958 it was bought by Associated British Corporation (ABC) for use as a television studio. When ABC was replaced by Thames Television (in which ABC's parent company had a 51% stake), Teddington Studios became the main production centre for Thames's entertainment programming (e.g. gameshows, children's programmes, dramas and comedy), while documentary shows, news and sports programming were made at Thames's Euston Road headquarters.\n\nAfter Thames lost its ITV franchise to Carlton Television, which took over in 1993, the studio became independent. Without a major broadcaster or studio group owning the studios, their future was questioned (as Carlton was going to commission most of its entertainment programming from independent producers), but it survived and stayed independent for 13 years, when in 2005, the Pinewood Studios Group bought the complex for £2.7m. Teddington was also the home of British TV Casino show Smart Live Casino until they moved to Picadilly Studios.\n\nThe media company Haymarket owned the Teddington Studios site from 2004 and occupied some of it from 2006. Part of the site was leased to Pinewood until 2014. Haymarket announced in June 2013 that it planned to redevelop the site into homes, meaning the end of Teddington Studios. In February 2016 it was reported that the site was being demolished to make way for a 213-flat development, the land having been sold to Singaporean firm City Developers for a reputed £80 million.\n\nThe site consisted of 8 studios in total, as well as post production editing facilities.\n\nStudio 1 was Teddington's largest studio at nearly . It was a fully digital widescreen studio, with audience seating for 500, making it popular for programmes such as \"Harry Hill's TV Burp \" for ITV and sitcoms \"The Green Green Grass\", \"After You've Gone\", \"My Family\", \"My Hero\", \"Reggie Perrin\" and \"Not Going Out\" (all for BBC One).\n\nOther notable productions made in Studio 1 included \"Men Behaving Badly\" (ITV and BBC), \"Pop Idol\" (ITV), \"Birds of a Feather\" (BBC and ITV), one series of \"Parkinson\" and \"Black Books\" (Channel 4).\n\nHistorically, many classic series were recorded in Studio 1. These include all of Tommy Cooper's shows produced by Thames Television (1973-1980), \"The Benny Hill Show\", \"Bless This House\", \"George and Mildred\", \"Man About the House\" and long-running light entertainment series such as \"This is Your Life\" and \"Opportunity Knocks\". The final four series made by \"Morecambe and Wise\" were also produced at Teddington's Studio 1 by Thames Television.\n\nStudio 2 measured nearly and has been the home to shows such as the early series of \"The Sooty Show\", \"Today with Des and Mel\" for ITV, \"Kilroy\" for the BBC and the first series of \"Trisha\" after moving to Channel 5. This studio was popular for programmes which required intimate medium-sized space, like \"Bremner, Bird and Fortune\" for Channel 4.\n\nStudio 3 was a much smaller studio at and was home to many music shows productions and television commercials.\n\nStudio 4 was a small studio at . CBeebies used the studio before moving back to BBC Television Centre in 2010 and then moving to MediaCityUK in 2011.\n\nAnother small studio, Studio 5 was home to The Chinese Channel.\n\nUntil early 2008, this was a small studio at .\n\nBuilt on the site of the prop store for Studio 2, this small studio was built within weeks for participation TV channel QuizCall, whose content is produced using widescreen cameras. The studio has been used for \"Dick and Dom's Funny Business\" and sitcom \"Starlings\" for Sky1.\n\nThis studio, also small, was the home of HIgh Flyer which produced Racing UK.\n\nLike many studios, Teddington also included set and prop storage, green rooms, wardrobe and makeup and provided car parking. However, many businesses were based at Teddington, providing products/services that catered for all production needs.\n\nAn office within the facilities was used to film The Office\n\n"}

The suburb was laid out by surveyor Gustav Arthur Troye.\n\nHoughton Estate has traditionally been informally divided into two areas: \"Upper Houghton\", and \"Lower Houghton\". Upper Houghton is the southern and south-eastern portion located on a ridge, while the northern Lower Houghton is flatter, and has a grid street pattern, with parts on both sides of the M1 freeway. Upper Houghton has been declared a National Heritage Area.\n\nUpper and Lower Houghton are separated by the East-West section of Houghton Drive and part of Louis Botha Avenue. Small sections of Upper Houghton lie east of Louis Botha Avenue (bordering Observatory), and west of the north–south section of Houghton Drive (bordering Parktown and Hillbrow). Houghton is surrounded by wealthy suburbs in all directions, except south, where Upper Houghton borders less-affluent suburbs like Yeoville and Hillbrow.\nHistorically a wealthy area, it contains many mansions on big stands, blocks of flats, as well as office parks (developed on the sites of former homes) on streets close to the M1 and on Louis Botha Avenue. Houghton is architecturally varied. \nThere are good examples of art deco buildings (particularly some of the flats), and many of the large houses in the 1930s are good examples of the Modern style inspired by the work of Le Corbusier (Chipkin 1993), including Stern House (1935) designed by Rex Distin Martienssen and partners.\n\nThe suburb, particularly Lower Houghton, is currently experiencing rapid redevelopment. Although many plots had already been subdivided in two, there is now a trend towards the development of cluster homes. This redevelopment is sanctioned by the City of Johannesburg's Regional Spatial Development Framework. The city sees many positive aspects to the redevelopment, but it is not uncontroversial and has resulted in the destruction of many traditional houses.\n\nAs with many suburbs in the North-East of Johannesburg, Houghton has historically been known for being a Jewish area, and has a shul known as West Street Shul.\n\nAs apartheid ended many Muslims moved to the Northern Suburbs of Johannesburg, including Houghton. A musallah was established in the east of the suburb, and, in 2011, a mosque, called \"Masjid ul Furqaan\" was built by the \"Houghton Muslim Association\" on the site of the mussalah. Another, larger mosque on West Street, visible from the M1 freeway, was, after delays, completed in 2013 by the \"Houghton Muslim Jamaat\".\n\nThere are few shops in Houghton itself, apart from convenience stores in petrol stations, but the area is close to numerous commercial nodes in Johannesburg, including those in Oaklands, Norwood, Killarney, Rosebank and Sandton.\n\nHoughton has two golf courses (Houghton and Killarney) and a large public park, The Wilds (which has been described as \"notorious\" for muggings and crime. A large sports club, the Old Edwardian Society (known as \"Old Eds\"), which includes a separate Virgin Active gym, is in Houghton.\n\nThere are a number of well known schools in Upper Houghton: King Edward VII School, a public school for boys, also known as KES), along with its associated primary school, King Edward VII Preparatory School, known as KEPS, and St John's College, a private Anglican school historically only for boys, while Roedean School (South Africa), a private girls school, is close by in Parktown. Houghton School (a public primary school) is in Lower Houghton.\n\nLower Houghton, and a small part of Upper Houghton, bordering Observatory, are part of Region E of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, and are currently (as of 2014) included in Ward 73, while most of Upper Houghton is part of Region F of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, and is part of Ward 67.\n\nDuring the apartheid era, the Houghton constituency in the whites-only parliament was represented by opponent of apartheid Helen Suzman until 1989, and was, for a period in the 1960s, the sole seat of the Progressive Party in Parliament.\n\nLower Houghton is part of the SAPS Norwood Police Station precinct, while Upper Houghton is part of the Hillbrow Police Station's precinct.\n\nHoughton is centrally located, straddling the M1 freeway, with interchanges at Glenhove Road (M1 N & S), Eleventh Avenue (M1 S), Riviera Road (M1 N), 1st Avenue (M1 S) and Houghton Drive (M1 N). Multiple metropolitan routes cross Houghton, including the M16, M20, M31, R25, and M11 (Louis Botha Avenue).\n\nThe grid street pattern in Lower Houghton consists mostly of numbered \"Streets\" and \"Avenues\" on both sides of the M1. \"Avenues\" run east–west, while \"Streets\" run from north to south. Avenue counting begins in the south with First Avenue (part of Metropolitan Route M16), and ends in the North with Seventeenth Avenue, while Street counting begins in the east with 1st Street, and ends in the West at 9th Street, with the numbered grid interrupted by Central, West and River Streets. North–south streets in Upper Houghton are generally named after trees, while east–west roads are named after Christian saints.\n\nLower Houghton and Upper Houghton are linked by Louis Botha Avenue, Houghton Drive, and the steep and winding Munro Drive, a National Monument which has a viewpoint with a view over the northern suburbs of Johannesburg.\n\nLouis Botha Avenue, in the east of the suburb, is an important minibus taxi route linking Hillbrow to Alexandra, and, as of 2014, construction began on the expansion of Johannesburg's Rea Vaya bus rapid transit system to Louis Botha Avenue. A Gautrain bus feeder route (numbered RB5) runs past the office parks on West Street, linking to the Rosebank Gautrain Station.\n\nThe most famous resident of Houghton Estate was Nelson Mandela; he died in December 2013 at his Lower Houghton home, which became a site of remembrance in the immediate aftermath of his death. His residence was on the corner of 4th Street and 12th Avenue.\n\n"}

{"id": "2222769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222769", "title": "Australian Aboriginal English", "text": "Australian Aboriginal English\n\nAustralian Aboriginal English (AAE) is a dialect of Australian English used by a large section of the Indigenous Australian (Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander) population. It is made up of a number of varieties which developed differently in different parts of Australia. These varieties are generally said to fit along a continuum ranging from light forms, close to Standard Australian English, to heavy forms, closer to Kriol. There are generally distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use. AAE is not to be confused with Kriol, which is a separate language from English spoken by over 30,000 people in Australia. Speakers have been noted to tend to change between different forms of AAE depending on whom they are speaking to, e.g. striving to speak more like Australian English when speaking to a non-Indigenous English-speaking person.\n\nSeveral features of AAE are shared with creole languages spoken in nearby countries, such as Tok Pisin in Papua New Guinea, Pijin in the Solomon Islands, and Bislama in Vanuatu.\n\nAAE terms, or derivative terms, are sometimes used by the broader Australian community. Australian Aboriginal English is spoken among Aboriginal people generally, but is especially evident in what are called \"discrete communities\", i.e. ex-government or mission reserves such as the DOGIT communities in Queensland. Because most Aboriginal Australians live in urban and rural areas with strong social interaction across assumed rural and urban and remote divides, many urban people also use Aboriginal English. \n\nAboriginal English does not make use of auxiliary verbs, such as \"to be\" and \"to have\", or copulas to link things together. For example, the Aboriginal English equivalent of \"\"We are working\"\" would be \"\"We workin'\"\". Linguists do not regard this as \"just dropping words out\", but as a fundamental change to the way in which English is constructed.\n\nAlthough \"he\" and \"him\" are masculine pronouns in standard English, in Aboriginal English, particularly in northern Australia, it may also be used for females and inanimate objects. The distinction between \"he\" as the nominative form and \"him\" as the oblique form is not always observed, and \"him\" may be found as the subject of a verb.\n\nIn some forms of Aboriginal English, \"fellow\" (also spelt \"fella\", \"feller\", \"fullah\", \"fulla\", \"balla\" etc.) is used in combination with adjectives or numerals, e.g. \"big fella business\" = \"important business\", \"one-feller girl\" = \"one girl\". This can give it an adverbial meaning, e.g. \"sing out big fella\" = \"call out loudly\". It is also used with pronouns to indicate the plural, e.g. \"me fella\" = \"we\" or \"us\", \"you fella\" = \"you all\".\n\n\"Balanda\" is a word used by the Yolŋu people for European people; originally from the Makassar language, via the Malay \"orang belanda\" (Dutch person).\n\nMany Aboriginal people use the word \"business\" in a distinct way, to mean \"matters\". Funeral and mourning practices are commonly known as \"Sorry Business\". Financial matters are referred to as \"Money Business\", and the secret-sacred rituals distinct to each sex are referred to as \"Women's Business\" and \"Men's Business\". \"Secret women's business\" was at the centre of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge controversy.\n\nMany Aboriginal people refer to their house as their camp, particularly in Central Australia and the Top End of the Northern Territory.\n\n\"Cheeky\" may be used to describe a dog or other animal that's likely to bite or attack.\n\nDardy, meaning \"cool\", is used amongst South West Australian Aboriginal peoples. This word has also been adopted by non-Indigenous Australian teens, particularly in the skateboarding subculture. Many Australian teens also use the word to describe something worth buying. \n\nDeadly is used by many Aboriginal people to mean excellent, or very good, in the same way that \"wicked\" is by many young English speakers. The Deadlys were awards for outstanding achievement by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. \n\nThis usage is not exclusive to Aboriginal people. It is commonly heard in Ireland.\n\nVictorian era English word for \"pretend\". Still used by some Australian Aboriginal people to mean joking generally. Gammoning – usually pronounced \"Gam'in\"'. This word is widely used across the Northern Territory of Australia by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and is now gaining usage elsewhere in Australia.\n\nAustralian language expert, Sidney J. Baker, lists \"gammon\" used by \"whitefellas\" as \"falsehood\".\n\n\"Gubbah\" is a term used by some Aboriginal people to refer to white people. The \"Macquarie Dictionary\" has it as \"\"n. Colloq. (derog.)\" an Aboriginal term for a white man.\" Also, \"\"gubba, n. Colloq. (derog.)\" 1. a white man. 2. a peeping tom. [Aboriginal: white demon].\" It is also said to be a shortening of the word \"government man\", which is itself 19th-century slang for \"convict\". Another theory is that it is a contraction of \"Governor\". It has also been suggested the word is the \"diminutive of garbage\". It is often used pejoratively and even considered unreasonably rude within urban Aboriginal circles.\n\nWhereas humbug in broader English (see Charles Dickens's Scrooge character) means nonsensical, or unimportant information, humbug in Aboriginal English means to pester with inane or repetitive requests. The Warumpi Band's most recent album is entitled \"Too Much Humbug\". In the Northern Territory, humbug is used by both black and white in this latter, Aboriginal way.\nThe most commonly recognised definition of humbug, refers to an Aboriginal person asking a relative for money. Humbugging can become a serious burden where the traditional culture is one of communal ownership and strong obligations between relatives.\n\nColloquially used to mean a group of Aboriginal people associated with an extended family group, clan group or wider community group, from a particular place or country. It is used to connect and identify the person and where they are from. \"My mob\" means my people, or extended family.\n\nMob is often used to refer to a language group, as in \"that Warlpiri mob\".\n\nThe term is also found in the name of hip-hop group, The Wilcannia Mob, from the town of Wilcannia in New South Wales .\n\nWhile \"rubbish\" as an adjective in many dialects of English means wrong, stupid, or useless, in the north of Australia, \"rubbish\" is usually used to describe someone who is too old or too young to be active in the local culture. Another use is meaning something is \"not dangerous\"; for example, non-venomous snakes are all considered to be \"rubbish\", while in contrast, venomous snakes are \"cheeky\". In both cases, \"rubbish\" approximately means \"inert\".\n\nEnglish word for a long story, often with incredible or unbelievable events. Originally a sailors' expression, \"to spin a yarn\", in reference to stories told while performing mundane tasks such as spinning yarn. In Australian English, and particularly among Aboriginal people, has become a verb, to talk. Often, \"Yarnin\".\n\nOften conjoined with the word \"deadly\", \"unna\" means \"ain't it?\" This word is used frequently in the 1998 novel \"Deadly, Unna?\" by Phillip Gwynne.\n\nSutton (1989) documents that some speakers of Aboriginal English in the area around Adelaide have an uncommon degree of rhoticity, relative to both other AAE speakers and Standard Australian English speakers (which are generally non-rhotic). These speakers realise /r/ as [ɹ] in the preconsonantal postvocalic position – after a vowel but before another a consonant – within stems. For example: [boːɹd] \"board\", [t̠ʃɜɹt̠ʃ] \"church\", [pɜɹθ] \"Perth\"; but [flæː] \"flour\", [dɒktə] \"doctor\", [jɪəz] \"years\". Sutton speculates that this feature may derive from the fact that many of the first settlers in coastal South Australia – including Cornish tin-miners, Scottish missionaries, and American whalers – spoke rhotic varieties. Many of his informants grew up in Point Pearce and Point McLeay.\n\n"}

He is best known as the primary vocalist and songwriter for the post-punk band Wire.\n\nNewman was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire in 1954 and attended the Watford School of Art.\n\nIn 1976 Newman formed the band Wire and was its main songwriter, singer and guitarist. Their first performance was on 1 April 1977 at the London nightclub Roxy. At the start, the band was considered a part of London's punk rock scene but later reached critical acclaim for their massive influence on post-punk, new wave and alternative rock. When the band temporarily split in 1980, Newman pursued a solo career. His first solo album, \"A-Z\", was released in 1980 on the Beggar's Banquet record label. The album veered from extremely skewed pop to more mainstream numbers, such as \"Order for Order\", which was compared by some to Gary Numan. A track from the demos for this LP (but not included on the original vinyl release), \"Not Me\", was covered by This Mortal Coil on their \"It'll End in Tears\" LP; This Mortal Coil then covered the \"A-Z\" track \"Alone\" on their second album \"Filigree & Shadow\". Newman's second LP, the entirely instrumental \"Provisionally Entitled The Singing Fish\", in which all the tracks were titled for numbered fish, was released on the 4AD Records label in 1981. A third LP, \"Not To\", which along with original compositions reworked a number of tracks originally written for Wire, was released in 1982 on 4AD.\n\nFollowing this, Newman travelled to India to collect sound recordings before rejoining the Wire in 1984.\n\nIn 1986, another solo LP, \"Commercial Suicide\" was released on the Crammed Discs label. A massive change in style for Newman, the album is reflective and highly orchestrated. His next LP, \"It Seems\", followed a similar path, albeit with far more use of sequencers – something Newman would continue to work with for a number of years. Both Crammed albums featured Malka Spigel who has been included in all subsequent solo and collaborative work.\n\nNewman's only other de facto solo outing was the mid-1990s release \"Bastard\", an almost entirely instrumental release with tracks largely built from guitar loops and samples. Released on his own label, Swim ~, the first pressing of the album was packaged with a free copy of Newman's four track \"Voice\" EP. Despite Newman's name being on the cover, he says these releases, along with several others on Swim ~, are essentially collaborative efforts with his wife and musical partner, Malka Spigel. \n\nColin Newman's song \"Alone\" made an appearance in the 1991 film \"The Silence of the Lambs\" in a scene in which the character Buffalo Bill is sewing in a basement. This song was also covered by This Mortal Coil on their \"Filigree & Shadow\" LP.\n\nNewman has produced, arranged and mixed various other artists. These include Virgin Prunes, Parade Ground, Minimal Compact, Alain Bashung, Silo & Lobe on the production and arrangement side and Hawkwind, Dead Man Ray, Fennesz, Polysics and Celebricide on the mix side. He has also mixed all new Wire releases since 2000.\n\nSince 2004, Newman has worked with Githead, a quartet composed of Newman and long-time collaborator Malka Spigel, as well as Max Franken and Robin Rimbaud. Newman has run the Pinkflag label for Wire since 2000. Immersion re-emerged in 2016 and he re-released his first 3 solo albums on swim ~ sub-label Sentient Sonics also in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The album was produced by Waldemar Sorychta and released by Century Media records in 1994. Vocalist Johan Edlund and John Hagel were the only two remaining members of Tiamat who were still with the group after their previous album \"Clouds\" in 1992. The album was marked a strong change in the style of Tiamat's music with more progressive rock- and psychedelic music-influenced music and a less death metal-oriented style. The music on the album deals with the occult, nature, and LSD.\n\nThe album was released on September 1, 1994 and was one of the highest-selling records for Century Media on its release. AllMusic praised the album, referring to it as \"one of the classics of the genre\".\n\nTiamat vocalist Johan Edlund was unhappy with the recording of the album \"Clouds\", stating that it \"definitely didn't turn out the way I wanted it to\". After the release of their 1994 tour EP, \"The Sleeping Beauty (Live in Israel)\", Edlund fired all members of Tiamat except for John Hagel.\nIn 1994, Tiamat began working on an album that would become \"Wildhoney\" with session musicians Magnus Sahlgren, Lars Sköld and Waldemar Sorychta, who acted as a keyboardist and producer. Edlund later stated that on \"Wildhoney\" that he \"really did what I wanted to do on \"Clouds\"\". The bird songs on the album were from a sound effects album Edlund had.

After college, Wilson pursued his interest in drawing and painting, first in San Francisco and then in Minneapolis.\n\nIn 1987, Wilson joined the Minneapolis psychedelic band, Trip Shakespeare, which Matt Wilson had founded with bassist John Munson and drummer Elaine Harris. The original three members had already released one record, and now as a quartet, with Wilson on guitar, piano, sharing lead vocal duties with Matt Wilson—with whom Wilson also co-wrote many of the songs—and Munson, the band released three more albums (\"Are You Shakespearienced?\", 1988, Gark Records; \"Across the Universe\", 1990, A&M Records; \"Lulu\", 1991, A&M Records) and one EP (\"Volt\", 1992, Twin Tone).\n\nSince Trip Shakespeare's breakup in 1992, Wilson has continued to collaborate with his brother, including the release of two live albums (\"Minneapolis 2010\" and \"Minneapolis 2013\").\n\nAfter Trip Shakespeare's breakup in 1992, Wilson and Munson joined with drummer Jacob Slichter to form Pleasure, a trio that was later renamed Semisonic. Semisonic released one EP, three full-length albums, and one live album.\n\nThe band's first album, \"Great Divide\", received critical acclaim. David Fricke wrote in a year-end Rolling Stone article on the notable albums of 1996, \"Great Divide is that rare '96 beast, a record of simple but sparkling modern pop, rattling with power-trio vitality.\" It was their 1998 release, \"Feeling Strangely Fine\", however, that brought the band to widespread national and then international attention and success. Powered by Wilson's songs \"Closing Time\", which was a number-one hit on the Modern Rock charts for thirteen weeks in the spring and summer of 1998, the follow-up single \"Singing in My Sleep\", and \"Secret Smile\", a breakthrough hit for the band internationally, \"Feeling Strangely Fine\" attained platinum sales status in the U.S. and U.K. \"Closing Time\" received a 1999 Grammy nomination for Best Rock Song and has become an enduring pop-culture reference point for the late 1990s. It was a focal point of the plot and soundtrack of the 2011 film \"Friends with Benefits\".\n\nSemisonic's third album, \"All About Chemistry\", was released in 2001, and featured Wilson's song \"Chemistry\", the album's first single, and also included \"One True Love\", a song Wilson co-wrote with Carole King.\n\nSemisonic stopped touring in August 2001 but continue to perform on occasion. Slichter's memoir, \"So You Wanna Be a Rock & Roll Star\", provides a detailed account of the band's adventures and misadventures in the music business.\n\nWilson's solo debut, \"Free Life\", was released in 2007 by American Recordings. Produced with Rick Rubin, \"Free Life\" was recorded in Minneapolis and Los Angeles and includes performances by Tracy Bonham, Sheryl Crow, Jason Lader, Gary Louris, Natalie Maines, Benmont Tench, and a number of Minneapolis-based musicians including multi-instrumentalist and frequent Semisonic sideman Ken Chastain, Eric Fawcett, John Hermanson, Joanna James, Mason Jennings, Steve Rhoem, Joe Savage, as well as Wilson's Semisonic bandmates Munson and Slichter.\n\n\"Free Life\" helped establish Wilson's reputation as a songwriter, with \"The A.V. Club\" writing, \"the star of the show here is Wilson's remarkable instinct for creating gorgeous songs, and his unabashed, obvious joy in doing so. For anyone worried that songcraft is an endangered species, \"Free Life\" should ease those fears.\"\n\nWilson's second solo album, \"Love Without Fear\", was released on April 15, 2014 and includes performances by Sara Bareilles, Missy Higgins, Lissie, Natalie Maines, Blake Mills, Sara Watkins, and Sean Watkins. The first recording from \"Love Without Fear\", \"Disappearing\" (with a cover of Neil Young's \"Out on the Weekend\" included as a b-side) was released on November 7, 2013 and was the debut release of the new singles label, Canvasclub.\n\nIn describing the album, Wilson said, \"The songs are about being left alone, not wanting to lose someone, about desperately wishing for connection and togetherness. The sound of the record lives at the intersection of Americana and Beatles- influenced rock and roll. A little bit of twang and a lot of cinematic emotion.\" The album received largely favourable reviews emphasizing Wilson's reputation as a songwriter. “Dan Wilson’s career is proof positive that smart, elegant songwriting has a place in music… [Love Without Fear] is a lovely amalgamation of chamber rock, gentle country, gooey '70s pop and snappy soul.\"\n\nWilson's third solo studio album, \"Re-Covered\", was released on August 4, 2017. The album is a collection of reinterpretations of songs Wilson wrote for other artists, both big hits and “songs that I always wished were big hits, but weren’t.” The album includes \"Someone Like You\" (written with Adele), \"Not Ready To Make Nice\" (written with Dixie Chicks), \"Home\" (written with Dierks Bentley and Brett Beavers), and \"When The Stars Come Out\" (written with Chris Stapleton).\n\nIn September 2018 Wilson announced that he would begin releasing new music that Fall. Rather than organizing the new songs into an album, he would instead release them over time as monthly singles. According to Wilson, “I fell in love with the idea of just letting songs out into the world when they happen.\" \"I don't have anything against making an album. If I do 15 or 20 of these I would love the idea of packaging them together and calling it an album. I think that'd be fantastic, but I don't really have that in my mind. I'm just trying to be free.\"\n\nWilson’s discoveries as a solo artist and collaborator with other artists are the subject of “Words and Music by Dan Wilson”, solo concerts in which he performs some of his songs and describes the songs’ various inspirations or the insights that occasioned their composition. “Words and Music by Dan Wilson” has come to Hotel Cafe, Room 5 and Largo in Los Angeles, Joe's Pub and City Winery in New York, World Cafe Live in Philadelphia, Jammin' Java in DC, Rams Head in Annapolis, The Cedar Cultural Center in Minneapolis, the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Schubas Tavern in Chicago, Berklee College of Music's Red Room at Cafe 939 in Boston, and the Red Barn concert series in Northfield, MN. Wilson has also presented Words & Music workshops at the 2012 ASCAP expo, UCLA's Herb Alpert School of Music, and USC's Thornton School of Music.\n\nWilson’s thoughts about songwriting and the creative process are also captured in his series, Words & Music in Six Seconds, which was originally launched on Vine and is now regularly posted on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. From American Songwriter, \"In his short videos, Wilson provides insightful quips about common songwriting insecurities, methodology, personal writing quirks, and various other tips for writing your best.\"\n\nAs a songwriter and producer, Wilson has collaborated with a number of artists. Two of these collaborations have earned him Grammy Awards.\n\nA number of artists have described Wilson's ability to help put their feelings and ideas into song. Speaking of her experience of working with him, Pink said, in an online interview, \"He is brilliant, and he's a thoughtful songwriter. And he's a song crafter . . . like old-school. He crafts songs and he thinks about them. And I learned a lot from working with him.” In describing her co-writing with Wilson, Adele said, \"Dan had me on my hands and knees, crying my eyes out - there's just something about him that made me completely open up as a composer.\"\n\nWilson co-wrote six of the songs on the Dixie Chicks multiple-Grammy-winning album \"Taking the Long Way\", including the title song and \"Not Ready to Make Nice\", which earned Wilson and the Dixie Chicks the 2007 Grammy for Song of the Year. In the 2006 film \"\", Wilson speaks on camera about his experience as a co-writer on this album, especially in regard to helping the Dixie Chicks make an artistic response to their rejection by radio and a large swath of their fans in the wake of the band's statements about President Bush and the Iraq War.\n\nOne of the songs he co-wrote for this album, \"Easy Silence\", appears on \"Free Life\", with Dixie Chicks singer Natalie Maines singing harmonies.\n\nWilson co-wrote three of the songs on Adele's multiple-Grammy-winning \"21\", \"Don't You Remember\", “One and Only\", and, most notably, \"Someone Like You\", which became a number one hit in the US, UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand was a top ten hit around the globe. As a producer of this track, on which he also played piano, Wilson shared in the 2012 Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nIn an interview with American Songwriter, Wilson recounted the writing and recording of \"Someone Like You\":\n\n\"Someone Like You\" won the 2012 Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance, and as she accepted the award, Adele said, \"I want to thank Dan Wilson, who wrote this song with me. My life changed when I wrote this song and I felt it before anyone even heard it.\"\n\n\"Someone Like You\" was the most downloaded single of all time in the UK and was voted third most favourite single of the last 60 years in the UK.\n\nWilson's career as a painter, illustrator, and calligrapher is less widely known, but his artwork has often intersected with his music career. He was represented by Thomas Barry Fine Arts in Minneapolis, and his works are included in numerous private and corporate collections.\n\nWilson's paintings are featured on the artwork for two of Trip Shakespeare's albums, \"Are You Shakespearienced?\" and \"Lulu\", as well as on the cover of his first solo album, \"Free Life\".\n\nWilson created all of the artwork for his 2014 album \"Love Without Fear\". Most notably, a hand illustrated 24-page hardcover Deluxe Album Book/CD. The package includes Wilson's own calligraphy, sketches, and handwritten lyrics for each song on the album. The official lyric videos for his singles from the album, “Disappearing” and \"A Song Can Be About Anything\" are also made entirely from his own illustrations.\n\nAt his \"Words and Music by Dan Wilson\" shows, audience members receive illuminated set lists that are hand illustrated by Wilson. One of these set lists was featured on NPR's blog All Songs Considered.\n\nWilson's calligraphy and illustrations are featured in his Tumblr series, “DW’s Sketchbook” and his musical cartoons have been featured in the Wall Street Journal's Speakeasy Blog.\n\nWilson is married to Diane Espaldon. Wilson and his wife were contemporaries at Harvard University, where he studied visual arts and she studied government. Wilson's wife subsequently earned a M.A. from School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University. Together, they have one biological daughter, Corazon (\"Coco\") (b. 1997), who was born prematurely and has disabilities and for whom \"Closing Time\" was written before her birth, and Lily (b. 2007), who was adopted at age two from the Philippines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2222853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222853", "title": "East Australian Current", "text": "East Australian Current\n\nThe East Australian Current (EAC) is the southward western boundary current that is formed from the South Equatorial Current (SEC) crossing the Coral Sea and reaching the eastern coast of Australia. At around 15° S near the Australian coast the SEC divides forming the southward flow of the EAC. It is the largest ocean current close to the shores of Australia. The EAC reaches a maximum velocity at 30° S where its flow can reach 90 cm/s. As it flows southward it splits from the coast at around 31° to 32° S. By the time it reaches 33° S it begins to undergo a southward meander while another portion of the transport turns back northward in a tight recirculation. At this location the EAC reaches its maximum transport of nearly 35 Sv (35 billion liters per second). The majority of the EAC flow that does not recirculate will move eastward into the Tasman Front crossing the Tasman Sea just north of the cape of New Zealand. The remaining will flow south on the EAC Extension until it reaches the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The Tasman Front transport is estimated at 13 Sv. The eastward movement of the EAC through the Tasman Front and reattaching to the coastline of New Zealand forms the East Auckland Current. The EAC also acts to transport tropical marine fauna to habitats in sub-tropical regions along the south east Australian coast.\n\nThe EAC is a surface current driven by winds over the South Pacific. During different parts of the year these winds control how the current behaves. The EAC starts on the west edge of the South Pacific gyre where it collects warm, nutrient poor water. As it skirts along the East Coast of Australia it carries a large amount of warm tropical water from the equator southward. This process is part of what allows the Great Barrier Reef to thrive, it keeps the east coast of Australia around 18 °C year round instead of dropping to 12 °C in the winter.\n\nThe current is very low in nutrients, however, it remains important for the marine ecosystem. The EAC removes heat from the tropics and releases it to the mid-latitude water and atmosphere. It does this by producing warm core eddies, which allow the Tasman Seas to have a large biodiversity. The most southern tip of the EAC can produce these Eddies by wind currents. As instabilities in the current develop due to a westward Tasman Front, the meander pinches off to form eddies at a rate of once or twice per year.\n\nThe EAC has nutrient poor water, however it does cause upwelling in places along the coast line. The Eddies produced cause an increase in vertical mixing within the Tasman Sea. The process of producing, moving, and destroying eddies causes the thermocline layer to mix with the surface layer, bringing some nutrients up to the surface. The EAC and its eddies frequently flow onto the continental shelf and inshore, influencing circulation patterns and increasing mixing. Eddies aren't the only way the EAC brings nutrients to the surface. Features along the coast push the current further off shore and if there is a strong northerly wind, it will push the current even further off shore, allowing deep water to rise up the coast, bringing nutrients up to the surface.\n\nThe EAC experiences seasonal variations. It tends to be strongest in the summer, with an amplitude flow around 36.3 Sv. It is its weakest during the winter months flowing at a rate around 27.4 Sv. Over the past 50–60 years the EAC has shifted. The south Tasman Sea has become warmer and saltier from 1944–2002. This has resulted in the current strengthening and extending southward. This shift in the EAC flow past Tasmania is controlled the Southern Hemisphere subtropical ocean circulation. This trend is thought to be caused by changes in wind patterns due to ozone depletion over Australia. There is a strong consensus with climate models that this trend will continue to intensify and accelerate over the next 100 years. The current is predicted to increase greater than 20%, thanks to the increase in South Pacific winds.\n\nIn the 2003 Disney/Pixar animated film \"Finding Nemo\", the EAC is portrayed as a superhighway that fish and sea turtles use to travel down the east coast of Australia. The characters Marlin and Dory join a group of sea turtles in using the EAC to help them travel to Sydney Harbour. The basic premise of the storyline is actually correct. Every summer, thousands of fish are swept from the Great Barrier Reef to Sydney Harbour and further south , however, the Current is not nearly as rapid as depicted in the film.\n\n\n"}

She is best known to English-language audiences for her roles in \"Rain Man\", \"Big Top Pee-wee\", and the two \"Hot Shots!\" films. In addition to the awards David di Donatello, Silver Ribbon, Golden Ciak, and Italian Golden Globe, she is one of three actresses to have twice won the Best Actress award at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nGolino was born in Naples, Italy, the daughter of an Italian father who was a Germanist scholar, and a Greek mother, Lalla, who was a painter. One of her grandmothers was Egyptian-French. She grew up in an \"artistic household\", and after her parents split up, was raised alternating between Athens and Sorrento (near Naples). Golino is the niece of the journalist Enzo Golino at \"L'Espresso\", and her brother is a musician. When she was a girl, her mother frequently took her to the cinema houses, and she quickly became interested in films. In spite of this, though, she never thought about pursuing a film career until she made her first movie. Instead, she wanted to be a cardiologist.\nValeria was diagnosed with scoliosis at age 11, and she had to have a steel rod implanted in her back for five years. She remained in the care of a surgeon in Chicago for six months, where she learned to speak English. At age 14, she started to work as a model in Athens, Milan, London, and Los Angeles. She was in TV commercials for beer, perfume, and cosmetics, and she modeled swimsuits and blue jeans. Being an unfocused student, she dropped out of high school after acting in her first movie.\n\nGolino never formally studied acting. Her career started by chance when her uncle Enzo received a phone call from director Lina Wertmüller, who was searching for a young girl for her movie, and encouraged Golino to go to Wertmuller's house and meet her. \n\nThe two met and Valeria was eventually cast in her film debut \"A Joke of Destiny\" (1983), alongside Ugo Tognazzi after an audition where she performed Shakespeare. Despite her parents' reservations and Wertmuller's demanding on-set behavior, she liked the experience so much that she decided to pursue an acting career. She quit modeling, a profession that she never found fulfilling or interesting, and started to study diction and elocution. Among her early auditions were \"Una spina nel cuore\" (an audition that she called \"distasteful\") and \"The Name of the Rose\" but was passed over for both films. She was offered roles in \"Giochi d'estate\" (1984) and other similarly themed romantic films about teenagers, but she turned them down to focus on smaller and more challenging projects.\n\nShe followed up her debut with a string of independent films, including roles in \"My Dearest Son\" and \"Little Flames\" (both 1985), her first leading role, both of which won her a Golden Globe award for Best Breakthrough Actress. Later that year she was involved in a car accident which displaced the metal bar in her back and had to have surgery in order to fix it: she was bedridden for five months. \n\nHer star-making role came the following year, when she played the life-loving cleaning lady who romances two different men in \"A Tale of Love\" by Francesco Maselli. Her performance received rave reviews and garnered her two prizes at the 1986 Venice Film Festival: the official Best Actress award (now called Volpi Cup) and the Golden Ciak award. The same film also won her the oldest and most prestigious critics prize of the Italian cinema: the Silver Ribbon award for Best Actress.\n\nHer following projects were once again independent, auteur-driven films: \"The Gold Rimmed Glasses\" and \"Three Sisters\". She was supposed to reunite with Maselli for his following film \"L'uomo della casa di fronte\", co-starring Marcello Mastroianni, but the project never got off the ground. The same director then moved on to another film, \"Codice privato\", and Golino turned down the role that was eventually played by Ornella Muti.\n\nShe moved to Los Angeles and began to work in Hollywood, with the movie \"Big Top Pee-Wee\" (1988). She was cast in \"Rain Man\" (also 1988), as the girlfriend of Tom Cruise’s character named Suanna, and the comedy films \"Hot Shots!\" (1991) and \"Hot Shots! Part Deux\" (1993), as the girlfriend of the hero (\"Hot Shots\" was a direct spoof of \"Top Gun\"). Her character's nationality in \"Rain Man\" was changed from American to Italian-American to accommodate her accent. Even though she was known as a dramatic actress in Italy, most of the offers she received in Hollywood were for comedies.\n\nGolino auditioned for lead roles in \"Pretty Woman\" and \"Flatliners\", but both times she lost the part to Julia Roberts during the final audition. She was first runner-up for both roles and, in the case of \"Pretty Woman\", she revealed many years later: \"I was in the running until the final audition: it came to down to Julia Roberts and me. The director asked us to walk in the same corridor, wearing the same clothes and makeup. As soon as I saw her [Roberts], I knew that she would have been chosen. And since she knew that, she told me: 'Go and get them, big mama!' I wouldn't have dared to say that to my rival. I would have been good in that film but she was perfect\". She also turned down the leading role in the Ken Loach film \"Hidden Agenda\", which she called \"an offer that I still regret having declined.\"\n\nIn 1993, she was heavily involved in producing and starring in an independent feature film \"Cat in the Box\", which was never made, and because of that project, she was forced to turn down a role in a movie directed by Carlo Verdone.\n\nDuring the following year, she was offered the leading role in \"True Lies\", but she had to turn that down because of conflicts in scheduling with \"I Sfagi tou kokora\" (1996), an independent film made in Cyprus. She had joined this film project in 1992, while it was still in preproduction, and she fervently wanted to be a part of it. Later on that year, she was supposed to act with Gian Maria Volonté in the film \"Treni sull'acqua\". This project would have marked her third collaboration with the director Peter Del Monte, but it was canceled after the death of Volonté.\n\nIn early 1996 she was supposed to play a journalist in the film \"Bravo Randy\", directed by Alessandro D'Alatri and also starring Jovanotti in the titular role of a tramp who falls into a coma after an accident. \n\nHowever, the project fell apart just a few months before shooting was slated to begin: fearing a lack of influence, the Italian production company blocked the funds as the film would have been shot in California.\n\nIn January 2001 she was supposed to star with Claudio Amendola in a TV mini-series called \"Cuore di ghiaccio\", directed by Luciano Casciani, produced by Mediaset and set in Cefalù, but the project never took off the ground.\n\nShe had a supporting role in the successful French thriller \"36, Quai des Orfèvres\" (2004) and a leading role in \"Cash\" (2008), although the producers of the film had wanted Kristin Scott Thomas instead. Her role as Irene in \"Sacred Heart\" (2004) had been written specifically for her by director Ferzan Ozpetek, but she was forced to abandon the project for personal reasons. She was replaced by Barbora Bobuľová.\n\nIn 2005, she was offered the leading role in \"Fine pena mai\" (2008) but she turned it down, considering herself to be too old for the part. The role was eventually played by Valentina Cervi.\n\nIn 2006 Theodoros Angelopoulos cast her in \"The Dust of Time\" (2008) after being impressed by Golino's work in \"Respiro\". However the many delays in the shooting forced her to drop out of the project in late 2007 for scheduling conflicts. She was replaced by Irène Jacob.\n\nIn 2009 she was the subject of the monograph \"Valeria Golino: Respiro d'attrice\" by Massimo Causo.\n\nThe following year she was offered the chance to direct a short film by the company Pasta Garofalo, \"Armandino e il Madre\", for which she also wrote the script. Her first feature film as director, \"Honey\" (2013), was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and won a commendation from the Ecumenical Jury.\n\nShe played Armida Miserere, high security warden in \"Like the Wind\" (2013) directed by Marco Simon Puccioni a difficult leading role praised by the critics and awarded in festival.\n\nDespite her self-deprecating reluctance, she also sang in several films, most notably her English-language films \"Hot Shots!\" and \"Big Top Pee-Wee\". She recorded two LPs in 1987, the song \"Maybe Once More\" for \"L'inverno\" and 'Piangi Roma' for \"Giulia Doesn't Date at Night\" (featuring Baustelle), the latter of which won her a Silver Ribbon award for Best Song.\n\nShe is a member of AMPAS thanks to the invitation of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.\n\nIn 2016 she was a member of the main competition jury of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\nShe also appeared in several music videos:\n\n\n"}

A relatively wealthy area, located west of the M1 freeway, Killarney is a densely built-up area, and it has numerous apartment blocks, as well as a large shopping mall, Killarney Mall.\n\nNeighbouring suburbs include Houghton Estate, Riviera, and Parktown.\n\nIt is home to the first shopping mall in Johannesburg. It was formerly known as the Hollywood of Johannesburg, due it being the location of one of the first film studios in South Africa. Killarney currently is home to consulates, tall residential buildings (including some of Johannesburg's best examples of Art Deco architecture) and a golf course. There is a large Jewish, Muslim community in Killarney. Killarney is very cosmopolitan and also has a large gay community.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the land in Killarney, an outlying northern suburb, belonged to I W Schlesinger’s African Realty Trust. ‘The Uncrowned King of Africa’ had bought the 43-hectare for £120,000. According to his plan, the majority of the sites were not to be built up. They were to remain a park area. Still, he demarcated a few areas for buildings.\n\nUS-born Schlesinger wanted to transplant American ways to South African soil, and particularly to his domain, Killarney. On the grounds currently occupied by the mall, he built African Film Studios, Johannesburg’s answer to Hollywood. This man, one of the richest in the country, preferred to live in a flat, New York-style. This might explain his decision to sell sites in the suburb for development of modern apartment blocks.\n\nDaventry Court was probably the first multi-storied block of flats erected in Killarney in the 1930s.\n\nIn its adverts, African Realty Trust used to describe Killarney as ‘a garden, an orchard, a vineyard, an orangery, a shrubbery, a pinery, a paradise, a picnic spot, a health resort, a township and a home’. Schlesinger, who lived in Whitehall Court, wanted to preserve this character of the suburb and was very particular about tidiness. If the construction workers accidentally spilt sand or some rubble over the sites’ boundaries, he immediately received a letter from Schlesinger’s office: ‘Please, keep Killarney clean!’\n\nThe area attracted many Jews. I W Schlesinger, the initial developer, was always open about his Jewish identity. He set up several facilities in Killarney that welcomed his co-religionists: the Transvaal Automobile Club or the Killarney Golf Course. There were quite a few Jewish tenants in Daventry Court from the very beginning.\n\nBy the 1960-70s, the status of Killarney had changed. It was no longer an area of choice for the forward-looking people. The average tenants were middle-aged or even elderly.\n\nFay Susser-Sher remarks in her thesis on Killarney: ‘Often after having brought up children on large plots in the very affluent suburb of Lower Houghton, the parents, after the children had left home, sold the houses and then moved into flats in Killarney.’\nMany of them settled there for life. A very prominent section consisted of affluent Jews, members of the Oxford Shul congregation, attended by Black domestic servants who lived in the outbuildings next to the block.\n\nAccording to the 1985 census about half of the suburb’s White population were older than sixty-five.\n\nThese days, Killarney is no longer the sparsely populated suburb it was at the inception of Daventry Court. There are almost sixty apartment blocks here, of which Whitehall Court and our building are the oldest.\n\nKillarney has become more cosmopolitan. Though Pick ‘n Pay at the mall still has a large kosher department, the suburb has lost its predominantly Jewish character. Gone are the well-to-do ‘blue-rinsed grannies of Killarney’. Since the early 1990s, the area has attracted the new multiracial middle-class, younger upward-mobile people.\n\nWhat’s more, occupancy and ownership have become more fluid.

SilverStar's snow season runs from late November to mid-April weather permitting. SilverStar provides summer lift access for mountain biking and hiking from the end of June through to September.\n\nSilverStar has an annual snowfall of 700 cm or There are a total of 132 marked trails, with a vertical drop of 760 m (2,500 ft). The elevation of the village is 1,609 m (5,280 ft) whilst the summit is 1,915 m (6,280 ft) above sea level. With access to nearby Sovereign Lake Nordic Centre, SilverStar offers extensive Cross Country skiing with more than 105 kilometres (60 miles) of daily groomed trails.\n\nSilverStar has a total of 12 lifts: One eight-seater gondola (summit express), one Six-Pack Express chairlift (Comet Six-Pack Express), two detachable high-speed quads (Silverwoods Express, Powder Gulch Express), two fixed-grip quads (Silver Queen Chair, Alpine Meadows Chair) one T-bar (Home Run T-bar), three beginner magic carpets, and two tube lifts, on of skiable terrain.\n\nThe resort spans over four mountain faces, giving it four distinct areas :\n\nVance Creek offers most of the beginner and intermediate runs on the mountain. Therefore it is usually the busiest face of the mountain and has mostly groomed runs along with intermediate and expert runs. Vance Creek is serviced by the \"Comet Six-pack Express\" which ferries skiers from below the Village base and Silver Woods areas to the summit at 1,915 m. The \"Summit Express”is a gondola that takes skiers directly from the Village to the summit as well.\n\nAttridge is a small area beside Vance Creek which offers a wide variety of glade and groomed runs. The \"Alpine Meadows\" chair is a fixed grip quad and offers ski-in/ski-out access to the mountain from the developed area called Alpine Meadows.\n\nSilver Woods is a recent expansion of the resort which is part of a catchment below the Comet Express and is serviced by the \"Silver Woods Express\" which is a detachable high-speed quad. Silver Woods offers many intermediate treed and glade runs and is an access point to the hill from the \"Knoll Residential Area\".\n\nPutnam Creek is an area which introduces skiers to more difficult terrain than the rest of the mountain. Most of the runs in the Putnam Creek area are black diamond and double black diamond runs consisting of steep lines with moguls and tree skiing. The \"Powder Gulch Express\", a Detachable high-speed quad gives lift access to the many runs and a way out with the \"Home Run T-bar\" back to the village.\n\nThe Early Days\n\nVernon resident Bert Thorburn became the first person to ski in the Silver Star area in 1930. He rode his bike up to the end of a logging road in the area and then walked a distance following forestry trails to a forest fire lookout. He camped there for the night and skied down the next day. In 1946 the first rope tow was built on Burney Ridge, south of Vernon above the lookout overlooking Kalamalka Lake long. It was powered by an old four cylinder engine. The cooling system was a 40-gallon water drum hooked up to the radiator. For $.50, you could ski all day.\n\nA few years later the ski hill was moved to Lavington on Michael Freeman's farm on the north slope above Highway 6. This had one or two rope tows and a shack for warming up with an oil barrel wood fired stove. You walked across the pasture to get to the shed. But skiing was limited to a few months of the year. The Ski Club had their eyes on Silver Star Mountain where they could ski 6 months of the year. But Silver Star was part of a Class A provincial park with no development allowed.\n\nSilver Star Sports was started by Russ Postill, Mike Lattey, Bill Attridge, Joe Peters, John Cassa and maybe John Hindle in 1956 or 1957. They got approval from the Province to build a ski hill in the Class A park in the summer of 1957 to go ahead but it was too late to build anything substantial so they brought in a trailer and small portable rope tow near Sovereign Lake where the snowmobile station is now. In 1958 the final three kilometers of the Silver Star road was pushed through by local contractor Russ Postill to the current day village area.\n\nConstruction of two rope-tow lifts and an A-frame day lodge were built in 1958. In 1959 a poma lift was installed from the level at the parking lot to the top of SilverStar Mountain, replacing the rope tow. In 1964 new t-bars were installed to replace the slower rope tows and in 1965 a second A-frame structure was added to the day lodge. In 1967 and 1968 the Summit and Yellow Chairs (6,000 feet) built by GMD Mueller were installed, making Silver Star Mountain one of the largest ski areas in Canada.\n\nOne of the challenges of the early rope tows was that the rope stretched as it was used and had to be cut, shortened and spliced at regular intervals. This was the job of Mike Lattey who would sit out in the snow undoing and splicing the cold wet rope under a tarp while everyone else stayed inside drinking hot chocolate. He was also the official photographer. Some of his photos can be seen in Paradise Camp and the pub in the village.\n\nSilverStar Mountain Resort Era\n\nIn 1981 Silver Star Sports purchased by Norm Crerar, Charlie Locke, John Hindle, Rob Marshall and John Gow and becomes Silver Star Mountain Resorts Ltd. The first Nordic trails were also cleared. In 1983 the Putnam Station Hotel is built by Russell Haubrich and Shella Ledingham, it is Silver Star's first on hill hotel. From 1984-1990 many new hotels and amenities are built on the hill. In 1990 the Silver Queen chair was built by Yan and replaced by a doppelmayr quad chair and serves as the bunny hill. In 1991 the original Putnam Creek and Vance Creek express quads were built and opened up extensive amounts of terrain. In 2001 the Schumann family, owners of Big White Ski Resort since 1985, reached an agreement in principle with the Honourable Judd Buchanan, (Order of Canada),the majority shareholder of Silver Star Mountain Resort on the purchase of the majority assets of Silver Star Mountain Resort. In 2002 Silver Star Mountain Resort invested heavily in new chair lifts and opening up new terrain followed by further expansion in 2005/06 to open up the Silver Woods ski area. 2005 was also the expansion of the Silver Star Bike Park to start using the Comet Six-Pack chairlift for biking. New trails were cut and all of the existing trails were extended all the way down to the bottom of the Comet chair.\n\nSilverStar is renowned for its Cross-Country Skiing facilities. With access to nearby Sovereign Lake Nordic Centre, SilverStar offers extensive cross-country skiing with more than 105 kilometres (60 miles) of daily groomed trails. The extensive trail system allows for an array of abilities to take in the sport.\n\nSilverStar's terrain park consists of an extensive rail garden and also has an assortment of table-top and step-up jumps for all abilities. Silver Star also has an Aerial Training Site, a Dual Moguls Race Course, and a race center which hosted the 2005 Canadian Masters Slalom Championships.\n\nExpanded in 2005 to start using the Comet Six-Pack the bike park features more than 50 km of downhill bike trails and more than 30 km of XC trail. The bike park features a 4 bike carrier lift system that uses a bike carrier on every second chair so you hardly ever wait in line. Biking terrain (XC and DH combined) consists of roughly 23% beginner green trails, 43% intermediate blue trails and 34% advanced and expert trails.\n\nApart from skiing and snowboarding, there are several other on-mountain activities.\nThese are:\n\nSilverStar’s My1Pass; is an all-inclusive seasons pass offering seven activities including downhill and cross-country skiing, snowboarding, tubing, skating, Fat Biking and snowshoeing.\n\n"}

{"id": "2222878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222878", "title": "The Wolfgang Press", "text": "The Wolfgang Press\n\nThe Wolfgang Press was an English post-punk band, active from 1983 to 1995, recording for the 4AD label. The core of the band was Michael Allen (vocals, bass), Mark Cox (keyboards), and Andrew Gray (guitar).\n\nThe group is best known for its 1992 international hit single \"A Girl Like You (Born To Be Kissed)\".\n\nThe official 4AD band profile describes them as \"post-punk\", transforming to \"avant-dance groovers\" with \"Queer\". The band was frequently labeled \"goth,\" though they denied the charge.\n\nAllen's list of \"important records\" as of 1995 included De La Soul's \"3 Feet High and Rising\", Massive Attack's \"Blue Lines\" and \"anything from Nick Cave and The Fall.\" He recalled that the record that \"maybe started it all\" for him was Public Image Ltd's \"Metal Box\".\n\nAllen started in The Models in 1977. Allen and Cox had both been members of Rema-Rema and Mass, while Gray had been a member of In Camera. All of these bands had also recorded for 4AD.\n\nRema-Rema was formed in 1978 by schoolmates Allen and Gary Asquith, with Cox, Marco Pirroni (also a school friend of Allen's and a fellow member of The Models) and Max Prior (who later recorded as Dorothy with Psychic TV). 4AD founder Ivo Watts-Russell said that hearing Rema-Rema's demo tape \"was the first point I knew that we were actually doing something serious [with 4AD].\" Their sole recording was the \"Wheel in the Roses\" 12\"EP (4AD BAD-5, 1 Apr 1980). The band split when Pirroni left to join Adam and the Ants (although Pirroni says he had already left), and reformed as Mass.\n\nMass consisted of Allen and Cox with Asquith and Danny Briottet. Mass recorded a single, \"You And I\"/\"Cabbage\" (4AD AD-14, Oct 1980), and an album, \"Labour Of Love\" (4AD CAD-107, May 1981). Mass split in 1981. Asquith and Briottet later (1986) formed Renegade Soundwave. (Asquith remained a friend and contributed to \"Queer\".)\n\nAfter Mass split, Allen and Cox continued working together. The influence of \"Metal Box\" was apparent in their live shows of the time and in their first recording as the Wolfgang Press, the 1983 album \"The Burden Of Mules\". \"Trouser Press\" describes it as \"dark and cacophonous, an angry, intense slab of post-punk gloom that is best left to its own (de)vices\"; the \"AllMusic Guide to Electronica\" describes some tracks as \"so morose and vehement as to verge on self-parody.\" \"ZigZag\" was more positive, regarding the album as an artistic success and an \"emphatic statement.\" The band's career retrospective compilation, \"Everything Is Beautiful\", contains no tracks from the album.\n\nGuest musicians included Richard Thomas (Dif Juz), David Steiner (In Camera) and guitarist and percussionist Andrew Gray, who soon joined the band.\n\nThe EPs \"Scarecrow\", \"Water\" and \"Sweatbox\" followed, produced by Robin Guthrie. These were later compiled (with some remixed versions) as \"The Legendary Wolfgang Press And Other Tall Stories\". The \"AllMusic Guide to Electronica\" describes \"Scarecrow\" as \"a lighter, more streamlined affair\", \"Water\" as spotlighting \"ominously sparse torch songs\", and \"Sweatbox\" as \"deconstructionist pop\".\n\nThe 4AD band profile describes \"Standing Up Straight\" as \"an intense blend of industrial and classical tropes\". \"Trouser Press\" describes it as \"as challenging and inventive as the band's other work, adding industrial and classical instrumentation to the creative arsenal\", \"dark and thoroughly uncompromising\" and \"not for the easily intimidated.\" The \"AllMusic Guide to Electronica\" describes it as \"a challenging, even punishing album, but a rewarding one as well.\"\n\nThe \"AllMusic Guide to Electronica\" notes \"Bird Wood Cage\" as \"one of the most pivotal records in the Wolfgang Press catalog; here, the trio begins to incorporate the dance and funk elements which would ultimately emerge as the dominant facet of their work.\" \"Trouser Press\" describes \"Bird Wood Cage\" as \"inserting fascinating bits of business into superficially forbidding songs\", including female backing vocals, funky wah-wah guitar and elements of dub reggae.\n\nThe album was preceded by the EP \"Big Sex\", which presages \"Bird Wood Cage\"'s musical themes. \"King Of Soul\", \"Kansas\" and \"Raintime\"/\"Bottom Drawer\" were singles from the album.\n\nAllen later said that \"Bird Wood Cage\" was the Wolfgang Press album he was most proud of.\n\nThe genesis of the 1991 album \"Queer\" was listening to De La Soul's 1989 debut album \"3 Feet High and Rising\". As Allen put it, this was when they \"rediscovered that music could indeed be fun.\" \"It seemed such a joyous record. There was a freshness and ease about the way it was made that inspired us to reassess our working process.\"\n\nThe album's sound includes many samples and funkier, poppier beats than previous albums. The \"AllMusic Guide to Electronica\" describes it as \"alien funk, a collection of idiosyncratic rhythms, dark textures, and ominous grooves.\" The band members each play multiple instruments, making the sound fuller than previous work. Bassist Leslie Langston of Throwing Muses guests on most tracks.\n\nThe singles from the album were \"Time\" (the album version being titled \"Question Of Time\"), which included a sample from Pink Floyd's \"Time\" (from \"The Dark Side of the Moon\"), followed by a cover of Randy Newman's \"Mama Told Me Not to Come.\"\n\nThe single \"A Girl Like You\" was released in May 1992 and became an international hit, scoring No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" US Modern Rock (Alternative Songs) chart on 15 August 1992. The song was later covered by Tom Jones, who then asked the band to write \"Show Me (Some Devotion)\" for him, both recordings appearing on \"The Lead and How to Swing It\" (1994). Jones also joined them on-stage for \"All Virgos Are Mad\", a 4AD anniversary concert in Los Angeles in January 1995.\n\nDue to sample clearance issues, the 1992 US release of \"Queer\" (which includes \"A Girl Like You\") needed considerable rerecording and remixing.\n\nAfter \"A Girl Like You\", the band bought their own studio, removing the financial pressure of traditional studio rental. The band spent two years recording \"Funky Little Demons\".\n\n\"Trouser Press\" describes the album as \"straight-ahead dance music with the correct materials\", though \"no longer enigmatic risk-takers, the Wolfgang Press have become just another white post-new wave soul band.\"\n\nThe single \"Going South\" reached No. 117 on the UK singles chart and No. 33 on the US alternative chart. A promotional CD of \"Christianity\" was also distributed in the US and a video released, directed by Mark Neale, but the band was dropped by 4AD before the single could be released.\n\nThe album spent one week in the UK Albums Chart at No. 75 in February 1995.\n\nCox left the band in February 1995, shortly before the release of the album. Allen and Gray aimed to continue, and toured the US without Cox to promote the album, but later conceded the band had run its course.\n\nA compilation album, \"Everything Is Beautiful (A Retrospective 1983–1995)\", was released in 2001. (Despite the name, it contains nothing from before 1984.)\n\nAllen records and plays live periodically with his band Geniuser with Giuseppe De Bellis, whom Allen regards as the driving force. Geniuser released the album \"Mud Black\" on the Phisteria label in 2005 and an EP called \"Press/Delete\" in 2010 on the same label. Gray played on the album. Allen also played with Gary Asquith's Lavender Pill Mob.\n\nGray recorded under the name Limehouse Outlaw, and released an album \"Homegrown\" on his own label on 27 May 2002, with some songs co-written by Allen. Gray also recorded with the Lavender Pill Mob.\n\nCox has contributed writing and production to a project entitled U:guru.\n\n\"Spin\" said the band claimed to have named themselves after a device that Mozart tried (unsuccessfully) to invent to type out his music. No such device is known. Allen has stated elsewhere that the name was chosen to be \"meaningless and open to interpretation.\"\n\nAll releases UK except as noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A large number of Marlboro resident reside in homes that have been passed down over generations.\nThe racial makeup of the Suburb is 85.30% Indian/ Asian and 15.70 other races.\n\nIt has had a long and multifarious history, in apartheid 1948, the township became a \"black spot\" and residents were threatened with removal. Freehold title was abolished and some families were removed, leaving the majority as tenants of the government.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Marlboro was characterized by conflict and development. There were long boycotts and clashes with the apartheid government, but during that time roads were tarred for the first time and houses and nearly 50 blocks of flats were built.\n\nThere has been a population boom in the township following the repealing of apartheid laws that restricted the movement of black people.\n\nPeople from across South Africa and from neighboring countries flooded into the area seeking work and shelter.\n\nIn the council there are two councilors, elected by votes from the Marlboro Township and who are responsible for the township and assert its interests.\n\nMarlboro South, known as Marlboro Industrial area, is a source of employment to Alexandra area where several plants and factories are located; the two areas are linked with an integrated road network.\n\nNevertheless, the area suffers from the lack of municipal services from the local authorities and has high level of crimes.\n\nBecause the most business owners are moving to better developed business areas, they abandon their premises and factories are closing, these premises being occupied by homeless people illegally. A big problem remains lack of public consultations and the loss of public sector skills.\nAnthony Blandford, director for the City of Johannesburg's Presidential Alexandra Renewal Project and the city council are going to restore the area by changing the zoning of the area from industry to a mixed-land property. Marlboro Industrial Area Development Committee has been formed to keep the project development and put it into practice.\n\nPolitical issues in Marlboro include framework area development, growth of population and working power, opening of additional public schools and revision of property taxes. There are 12 sectors that need revision and improvement.\n\nA local waste disposal company, SA Waste Holdings (Pty) Ltd, has been lately in the news. The company employs many people from Marlboro and neighbouring Alexandra. However, residents of Alexandra have often complained to the authorities about the potential health risks emanating from the company's recycling plant.\n\nMarlboro Gardens Combined School is the only school for the local children.

He fought Evander Holyfield, George Foreman, Riddick Bowe, Michael Moorer, Chris Byrd, Ray Mercer, and Corrie Sanders, among others. Cooper challenged three times for a world title, and was known for being in several wild fights in the 1990s, including his world title bouts with Holyfield and Moorer.\n\nCooper came out of Philadelphia and was trained in his early years by ex-champ Joe Frazier, and rose in the rankings with a series of explosive knockouts in the Cruiserweight division. Unable to get a world title shot despite winning the NABF belt and defeating Olympic gold medallist Henry Tillman and future world champion Tyrone Booze, he began boxing in the heavyweight division, knocking out Willie DeWitt in 2 rounds but being stopped in 8 rounds by No. 1 ranked heavyweight contender Carl \"The Truth\" Williams and in 2 rounds by George Foreman.\n\nIn 1990, having failed to secure a cruiserweight world title fight, Cooper moved to heavyweight permanently, knocking out top 5-ranked Orlin Norris and claiming his NABF title. He lost the title in his first defense, outpointed over 12 by undefeated Olympic gold medallist Ray Mercer in an explosive brawl. Later the same year he was KO'd in 2 rounds by fast-rising Riddick Bowe and his career looked over. However Cooper bounced back in 1991, stopping Joe Hipp in 5 rounds then being matched on short notice with Evander Holyfield for the undisputed heavyweight championship after two opponents dropped out. Cooper came off the floor in the first round to stun Holyfield in the 3rd round, the two exchanging big blows before the referee Mills Lane stopped the fight in the 7th.\n\nThe fight made Cooper a big name and he would be matched in many high-profile fights over the years. In June 1992 he boxed undefeated Michael Moorer for the vacant WBO title, knocking Moorer down twice but also going down twice himself before being stopped in the 5th. Cooper's career went downhill from this point, being outpointed by veteran Mike Weaver for an obscure title in China then losing to prospects like Corrie Sanders, Chris Byrd, Fres Oquendo, and Joe Mesi.
