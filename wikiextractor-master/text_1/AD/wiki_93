{"id": "2308763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308763", "title": "Swiss Plateau", "text": "Swiss Plateau\n\nThe Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau (; ; ) is one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland, lying between the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface area, and is partly flat but mostly hilly. The average height is between and AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, the center of economy and important transportation.\n\nIn the north and northwest, the Swiss Plateau is sharply delimited geographically and geologically by the Jura Mountains. In the south, there is no clear border with the Alps. Usually, the rising of the terrain to altitudes above 1500 metres AMSL (lime Alps, partly sub-alpine molasse), which is very abrupt in certain places, is taken as a criterion for delimitation. Occasionally the regions of the higher Swiss Plateau, especially the hills of the canton of Fribourg, the Napf region, the Töss region, the (lower) Toggenburg, and parts of the Appenzell region are considered to form the Swiss Alpine foreland in a narrow sense. However, if a division into the three main regions Jura Mountains, Swiss Plateau and Alps is considered, the Alpine foreland belongs clearly to the Swiss Plateau. In the southwest, the Swiss Plateau is confined by Lake Geneva, in the northeast, by Lake Constance and the Rhine.\n\nGeologically, the Swiss Plateau is part of a larger basin that extends beyond the border of Switzerland. At its southwestern end, in France, the plateau, in the Genevois, ends at Chambéry where Jura and Alps meet. At the other side of the Lake Constance, the plateau continues in the German and Austrian Pre-Alps.\n\nWithin Switzerland, the Swiss Plateau has a length of about , and its width increases from the west to the east: In the Geneva region, it is about , at Bern about and in eastern Switzerland about .\n\nMany cantons of Switzerland include a part in the Swiss Plateau. Entirely situated within the Swiss Plateau are the cantons of Zurich, Thurgau and Geneva; mostly situated within the Swiss Plateau are the cantons of Lucerne, Aargau, Solothurn, Bern, Fribourg and Vaud; small portions of the Swiss Plateau are situated in the cantons of Neuchâtel, Zug, Schwyz, St. Gallen and Schaffhausen.\n\nThe geological layers of the Swiss Plateau are relatively well known. The base level is crystalline basement which outcrops in the central crystalline Alps as well as in the Black Forest and the Vosges mountain range but forms a deep geosyncline in the Swiss Plateau and in the Jura (see also Jurassic). Around 2500 – 3000 metres below the surface, but considerably deeper near the Alps, the drillings have hit the crystalline basement. It is covered by unfolded strata of Mesozoic sediments, which are part of the Helvetic nappes. Its depth gradually decreases from about 2.5 km in the west to 0.8 km in the east. These layers, like the ones of the Jura Mountains, were deposited in a relatively shallow sea, the Tethys Ocean. Above the Mesozoic layers, is the Molasse, consisting of conglomerate, sandstone, marl and shale. The uppermost layer consists of gravel and glacial sediments that have been transported by the glaciers of the ice ages.\n\nGeologically the most important layer of the Swiss Plateau is the thick molasse sequence that accumulated at the border of the Alps due to the rapid erosion of the concurrently uplifted mountains. The thickness of the molasse increases from west to east (at the same distance from the Alps). The former alpine rivers built huge fans of sediment at the foot of the mountains. The most important examples are the Napf fan and the Hörnli fan; other sedimentary fans exist in the Rigi region, in the Schwarzenburg region and in the region between the eastern lake Geneva and the middle reaches of the Saane/Sarine.\n\nThe eroded material has been sorted by grain size. The coarse material was predominantly deposited near the Alps. In the middle of the plateau, there are finer sandstones and near the Jura, clays and marl.\n\nDuring the Tertiary orogenic uplift, around 60 – 40 million years ago, the area of today's Swiss Plateau was a Karst plateau somewhat inclined to the south. Through processes of rising and lowering that were brought by the folding of the Alps, the area was twice flooded by a sea. The corresponding sediments are distinguished as sea molasse and freshwater molasse, even though the latter consists rather of fluvial and eolian sediments (a kind of \"mainland molasse\").\n\nIn the following time, especially the western part of the plateau was again significantly risen, so that in this area, the sediments of the upper sweetwater molasse and the upper sea molasse have been largely eroded.\n\nA characteristic of the sea molasses are fossil snails, shells and shark teeth, whereas in the sweetwater molasse, fossils of typical land mammals and former subtropical vegetation (for instance palm leaves) are found.\n\nThe contemporary landscape of the Swiss Plateau has been shaped by the ice age glaciers. During all the known alpine glaciations (Günz glaciation, Mindel glaciation, Riss glaciation and Würm glaciation), huge glaciers penetrated the Swiss Plateau. During the warm interglacials, the glaciers receded to the high alps (sometimes more than today) and subtropical vegetation spread in the plateau.\nDuring the ice ages, the Rhône glacier split into two branches when leaving the Alps, covering the whole western Swiss Plateau reaching today's regions of Solothurn and Aarau. In the region of Bern it merged with the Aar Glacier. The glaciers of the Reuss, the Limmat and the Rhine advanced sometimes as well until the Jura. The glaciers formed the land by erosion, but also by base moraines (very fine stone meal) often several meters thick, and by the meltwater streams depositing gravel.\n\nTraces of the older Günz and Mindel glaciation are only left in a few places, because most has been removed or transferred by the later glaciations. The greatest extension was reached by the glaciers of the Riss glaciation, when the entire Swiss Plateau was covered with ice except for the Napf and Töss regions. Most notable are the traces of the Würm glaciation about 15 000 years ago. The end moraines of different glacial retreats have been conserved.\n\nA look at a map still reveals the directions where the ice age glaciers ran. The farthest expansion of the Rhône Glacier to the northeast is indicated by way the western Swiss Plateau valleys trend: The valleys of the Broye and the Glâne as well as Lake Murten, Lake Neuchâtel, and Lake Biel that trend all northeast, parallel to the Jura and to the Alps. The glaciers of the Reuss and the Limmat have carved the valleys of the central Swiss Plateau that trend northwest (among others including the valleys of the Wigger, the Suhre, the Seetal, the Reuss and the Limmat). The Rhine Glacier has mostly left traces that trend west: The eastern Swiss Plateau of the Thur Valley and Lake Constance. In certain places, there are characteristic drumlins of base moraine, often clustered, especially in the highlands of Zurich, in the Hirzel region, in the Lake Constance region and between the Reuss Valley and the Lake Baldegg.\n\nAnother reminder of the glaciation are glacial erratics which are found all over the Swiss Plateau. These rocks, sometimes of an enormous size, are of alien stones, mostly granite and gneiss from the central crystalline Alps. Taken together, they were one of the clues that led to the substantiation of the glaciation theory in the 19th century since a transport by water or by volcanism was physically impossible.\n\nGravel deposits in the bottoms of the valleys are another testimonial of the glaciation. During the advances and withdrawals of the glaciers, gravel layers were deposited in the valleys, sometimes quite thick, though most of it eroded in the subsequent interglacials. Therefore, many valleys have characteristic terraces, the lower terraces consisting of Würm glaciation gravel, the higher terraces of Riss glaciation terraces. Sometimes, there is also gravel from older glaciations.\n\nEven though the Swiss Plateau forms a basin, it is by no means a flat territory, but depending on the region, it has a manifold structure. Important elements are the two big lakes, Lake Geneva and Lake Constance that delimit the Swiss Plateau in the southwest and the northeast. The western plateau is stamped by the Gros-de-Vaud plateau (up to 600 meters AMSL) and the Jorat molasse hills (up to 900 meters AMSL) but sometimes intersected by deep valleys. Only near the Jura there is an almost continuous dip consisting of the Venoge and the Orbe valleys which are separated by the Mormont hill, the main watershed between Rhône and Rhine, at only 500 m AMSL. The Seeland ('lake land'), characterized by the Murten, Neuchâtel and Biel lakes, represents the biggest plain of the Swiss Plateau, though it is also interrupted by isolated molasse ranges. In the east, it is neighboured by various hill countries the height of which decreases to the north. Another major plain is the \"Wasseramt\" where the Emme runs. In a broad valley alongside the Jura, the Aare collects all the rivers that come down from the Alps.\nThe central Swiss Plateau is characterised by a number of ranges and broad valleys, some of them with lakes, that run northwest. The last of them is the Albis range, which together with the Heitersberg range forms a bar from the Alps to the Jura that the major transportations bypass only in a few places, mostly in tunnels.\n\nThe eastern Swiss Plateau is structured by the valleys of the Limmat (including Lake Zurich), the Glatt, the Töss, the Murg, the Thur, and the Sitter. Between them there are hill countries, in the canton of Thurgau also the broad molasse ranges of Seerücken (lit.: 'back of the lake') and \"Ottenberg\" north of the Thur, and the hilly ranges between the Thur and the Murg. This area is colloquially also known as \"Mostindien\" (lit.: 'Cider India').\n\nTwo hill countries get out of line of the mentioned landscapes: The Napf region (with 1408 me AMSL the highest point of the Swiss Plateau) and the Töss region (up to 1300 meters AMSL), both of them the remains of Tertiary conglomerate sediment fans. Since they were not glaciated, they have only been eroded by water, resulting in a dense net of deep, narrow valleys.\n\nThe Swiss Plateau is situated within a transition zone between humid oceanic climate and continental temperate climate. The predominant wind comes from the west. In the lower plateau, the mean annual temperature is about 9 – 10 °C. In January, the lake Geneva region and the watersides of lake Neuchâtel and lake Biel have the highest mean temperature of about +1 °C. At the same height AMSL, the temperature is decreasing towards the east. In the lake Constance region, the mean temperature of the coldest month is -1 °C. In July, the mean temperature of Geneva is 20 °C, alongside the southern edge of the Jura it is 18 – 20 °C, and in higher regions 16 – 18 °C. With regard to mean sunshine duration, the lake Geneva region is again advantaged with more than 1900 hours, whereas in the rest of the Swiss Plateau, it is between 1600 (especially in the east) and 1900 hours.\n\nThe annual average rainfall is between 800 millimeters near the Jura, 1200 millimeters in the higher regions and 1400 millimeters at the edge of the Alps. The driest regions of the plateau are in the lee of the High Jura between Morges and Neuchâtel. In the warmest regions at the lakes of Geneva and Neuchâtel, there are less than 20 days with a snow cover, whereas in the rest of the plateau, it is between 20 and 40, depending on the height.\n\nIn the winter half year, the air on the Swiss Plateau can stay still, with little exchange to rest of the atmosphere, building a lake of cold air on the plateau and often a ceiling of high fog. The clouds look like an ocean of fog when seen from above, (usually around 800m) and hence is called the 'nebelmeer'. This weather is called inversion because the temperature below the fog is lower than the temperature above. Sometimes, it lasts for days or even for weeks, during which the neighbouring regions of the Alps and the Jura can have the brightest sunshine. Typical for the high fog is the bise, a cold wind from northeast. Since it is channelled by the Swiss Plateau narrowing in southwest, it reaches its major strength in the lake Geneva region where wind speeds of 60 km/h with top speeds of more than 100 km/h are usual in typical bise weather. The regions near the Alps of the central and eastern plateau sometimes have temperature rises due to the warm foehn wind.\n\nThe dominating vegetation in the Swiss Plateau is mixed broadleaf forest with European beeches and silver firs. For forestry, there are major plantations of Norway spruces in many places, though the Norway spruce naturally only grows in the mountains. In certain favoured spots that are warmer and drier, in the lake Geneva region, in the \"Seeland\" and in northern plateau between the Aare orifice and Schaffhausen, the predominant trees are oak, tilia and maple.\n\nEven though the Swiss Plateau takes only about 30% of the surface of Switzerland, 5 million people live there, which constitutes more than two thirds of the Swiss population. The population density is 380 people per square kilometer. All the Swiss cities with more than 50 000 inhabitants except Basel and Lugano are situated in the plateau, especially Bern, Geneva, Lausanne and Zurich. The agglomerations of these cities are the most populous areas. Other densely populated areas are the south edge of the Jura and the agglomerations of Lucerne, Winterthur and St. Gallen. Regions of the higher Swiss Plateau like the Jorat region, the Napf region or the Töss region are comparatively scarcely populated with little farming villages and scattered farms.\n\nA majority is German-speaking, though the west is French-speaking. The language border has been stable for many centuries even though it falls neither on a geographical nor on a political delimitation. It passes from Biel/Bienne over Murten or Morat and Freiburg or Fribourg to the Fribourg Alps. The cities of Biel/Bienne, Murten and Fribourg are officially bilingual. Localities along the language border usually use both names, the German and the French one, officially interchangeable.\n\nHumans began to settle the plateau in the Neolithic, starting with the banks of lakes and rivers. Major oppida were built after the Celts appeared in the 3rd century BC. Urban settlements with stone houses were built during the Roman Empire. The Swiss Plateau became a part of the Roman Empire 15 BC when the Romans occupied the land of the Helvetii under the reign of Augustus, and it remained Roman until the end of the 3rd century. The most important Roman cities in the Swiss Plateau were \"Auenticum\" (today \"Avenches\"), \"Vinddonissa\" (today \"Windisch\"), \"Colonia Iulia Equestris\" or, by its Celtic name, \"Noviodunum\" (today \"Nyon\") and \"Augusta Raurica\" (today \"Kaiseraugst\"). They were well connected by a net of Roman roads. After the retreat of the Roman Empire the romanized Burgundians occupied the western Swiss Plateau, while the Alamanni settled in the central and eastern portions. The language border between French and German dialects originated in this contrast.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages many towns were founded, especially in the climatically more favoured lower plateau. In 1500 there were already 130 towns, connected by a dense road-network. With the rise of industrialisation in the early 19th century the cities became more and more important. In 1860 a drastic population growth of the cities started which lasted for about 100 years. In the 1970s, however, an outmigration from the cities started. Therefore, the municipalities surrounding the cities grew disproportionately, whereas the cities themselves lost inhabitants. In recent times the outmigration has moved farther away from the cities.\n\nThanks to favourable climate and fertile grounds, the lower western plateau is the most important agricultural region of Switzerland. The most important cultures are wheat, barley, maize, sugar beet and potato; especially in the \"Seeland\", vegetables are very important, too. Along the northern shores of the lakes of lake of Geneva, lake of Neuchâtel, lake of Bienne, lake of Morat, as well as in the Zürich Weinland and Klettgau, there is viticulture. Grassland with dairy farming and beef production is predominant in the eastern plateau and in the higher regions. Especially in the Thurgau, fruit (apples) is important.\n\nThe forests in the Swiss Plateau are used in forestry. There are many Norway Spruce forestations, often in monoculture because of their valuable timber.\n\nWith respect to industry, the plateau is the most important region of Switzerland. The traditional textile industries are situated especially in the central and eastern regions. During the last decades, however, it lost importance. Today's most important industries are the machine industry, the automotive industry, the electrical industry, the fine & micro mechanical, watch & electronic industries, next to the optical and metal construction's. The food industry processes domestic as well as foreign produces. Furthermore, wood processing and paper converting are also important.\n\nLike all Switzerland, there are few mineral resources. Thanks to the Ice Age glaciers, there is plenty of gravel and clay. The gravel digging in the Ice Age gravel terraces all over the Swiss Plateau covers the demands of the construction industry.\n\nNumerous hydroelectric power plants in the rivers produce electricity. All four Swiss nuclear power plants are situated in the plateau.\n\nBecause of the comparatively easy topography and the dense population, the transport network is highly developed. The most important transversal, so to speak the backbone of the Swiss Plateau, is the A1 motorway that connects all the big cities going from Geneva over Lausanne, Bern, Zurich and Winterthur to St. Gallen.\nThe A2, the Swiss north-south axis, crosses the plateau from Olten to Luzern.\n\nThe railway network is very dense. All major cities are connected, and between Olten and Lausanne there are two main lines: One passing over Bern and Fribourg, the other passing over the edge of the Jura with Solothurn, Biel, Neuchâtel and Yverdon-les-Bains. The train ride from Zurich to Bern takes one hour; crossing the entire Swiss Plateau from St. Gallen to Geneva takes four hours.\n\nThe two most important Swiss airports are situated in the plateau, Zurich Airport and Geneva Cointrin Airport. The \"de facto\" capital of Switzerland, Bern, has only a small airport, Bern Belpmoos Airport.\n\nHärkingen respectively Niederbipp and Zürich are scheduled as one of the eight hubs of the proposed Cargo Sous Terrain, an underground cargo transport system those first phase of about is planned by the early 2030s.\n\nCompared to the Swiss Alps, the plateau, and especially the rural plateau, is less geared to tourism. It serves as a transit region. Visitors mainly come to see the major towns and cities with their historical sights and attractions, especially the Old Towns of Bern and Lucerne, but also Zurich, St. Gallen, Fribourg, Geneva and Lausanne. An important natural touristic attraction is the Rhine Fall near Schaffhausen. The lakes also attract tourists, and then there are several spa towns, Baden, Schinznach-Bad, Yverdon-les-Bains and Zurzach, thanks to their hydrothermal vents.\n\nZurich Wilderness Park is the largest mixed deciduous and coniferous forest in the plateau, and includes the Sihl forest and Langenberg, the oldest Swiss wildlife park. The park covers approximately .\n\n\nMuch of the content of this article comes from (retrieved July 26, 2005). The following references are cited by that German-language article:\n\n"}

{"id": "2308782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308782", "title": "Black Kiss", "text": "Black Kiss\n\nBlack Kiss is a hardboiled erotic American comic book limited series written and drawn by Howard Chaykin, which was originally published in 1988 by Vortex Comics.\n\n\"Black Kiss\" became one of the most controversial North American comics of the late 1980s, due to the comic having the sort of explicit scenes of sex and violence unseen in most comics published at the time. The twelve-issue series was written and drawn by Howard Chaykin, author of the \"American Flagg!\" series which often hinted at the sort of sexual content which \"Black Kiss\" showed in detail. In fact, Vortex Comics' usual printer refused to print the book due to its content.\n\nTo help retailers who had worries over selling what could be described as pornography, Vortex released the series sealed in a plastic bag. This meant that casual browsers could not open the comic, or obviously see the internal content (however, this was not done when Vortex released a series of collected editions called \"Big Black Kiss\" in 1989).\n\nThe series attracted a vast amount of controversy, mainly over its sexual content, but also because of the pairing of sex and violence that Chaykin used throughout the series, and especially in the later issues. However, the series attracted praise for bringing the hard-boiled crime genre back into comics, and Chaykin himself was appreciated for his storytelling techniques.\n\nChaykin has described his thinking behind tackling such controversial topics:\n\nThe series is set in Los Angeles in the 1980s and opens with Dagmar Laine, a transsexual prostitute and lover to former 1950s film star Beverly Grove, searching for a reel of film taken from the Vatican's collection of pornography. The reel has been sent to Father Frank Murtaugh by his brother who is a Cardinal in the Vatican. Laine tries to grab the reel from Father Murtaugh but the reel is stolen by a nun.\n\nLaine and Grove then get Cass Pollack, a jazz musician and ex-heroin addict who is on the run from the Mafia, to steal the reel in return for them providing Pollack with an alibi. Pollack is also on the run from the police, due to the Mafia killing Pollack's wife and daughter and Pollack being the only suspect.\n\nLaine and Grove (who look virtually identical) provide Pollack with a lead as to where the reel is after the death of Father Murtaugh. This takes Pollack first of all to an occult bookshop called \"The Oath of Incannabulata\" where he steals a copy of a book about the mysterious \"Order of Bonniface\". After the bookshop he ends up in a funeral home called \"Tanas\" where he finds a number of celebrities indulging in bizarre rituals.\n\nGoing through Murtaugh's possessions, Pollack finds an invitation to the next meeting of the \"Order of Bonniface\". He attends this and discovers the Order was formed at the beginning of Hollywood's movie era and that they worship Charles 'Bubba' Kenton, a 1920s film star who was also married to Beverly Grove. He discovers that Kenton forced Grove to give their daughter Sophie up shortly before Kenton became a vampire. After becoming a vampire Kenton forms The Order of Bonniface and turns many of his followers into vampires, including Beverly Grove. This gives Grove the chance of revenge over the loss of her daughter and she switches Kenton's alarm clock so that he wakes during the day and dies in the sunlight.\n\nHowever The Order want the reel of film as it shows Beverly Grove and Bubba Kenton together in a pornographic film which shows that Grove is much older than she claims to be to the world. They hope she can turn them into vampires and therefore give them eternal youth.\n\nHowever one of The Order, a young woman called Magda, wants Grove to only make her a vampire. This is because she is Grove's granddaughter, in addition to the nun who stole the reel from Father Murtaugh earlier in the story. Pollack becomes caught in the middle as everyone around him attempts to win, leaving Pollack in a position where he seems unable to survive.\n\nVortex republished \"Black Kiss\" in 1989 in three comic books, four of the original comics per issue, entitled \"Big Black Kiss\".\n\nThe series has been collected into trade paperback format several times, including \"Thick Black Kiss\" from Vortex in 1993 () with an introduction by Sam Hamm, a 2002 edition released by Eros Comix (), and a softcover translated in French in 2010 by Delcourt ().\n\nA German edition has been published by Austrian publisher Comicothek, including a three-part softcover edition in 1992 as well as a limited hardcover collection in the mid-1990s.\nA hardcover collection was published by Norma Editorial in Spanish () in 2003 and by Dynamite Entertainment in English in 2010.\n\nThe series was released simultaneously as a trade paperback () and a hardcover collection () by Devir in Portuguese in 2011.\n\nThe series was released as a trade paperback () by Planeta Komiksów in Polish in 2016.\n\n"}

He won numerous literary awards and was a professor of Korean Literature. His works have been translated into English, German and Spanish.\n\nKim was born in Chungmu (present-day Tongyeong) on November 25, 1922. He studied literature at Nihon University in Japan from 1940 to 1943, at which time he was expelled and jailed for speaking against the Japanese Empire. After his release seven months later, he returned to Korea and taught in middle and high schools. He began to publish poetry in 1946. He joined the faculty of Kyungpook National University in 1965, and became Dean of the Department of Literature at Yeungnam University in 1978. In 1981, he was elected to the National Assembly. Kim died on November 29, 2004.\n\nHe made his debut with the publication of his poem “The Hothouse” in the eighth volume of Bamboo Shoots and release of his collection of poems, Clouds and Roses, the same year. After the introduction of his work in the late forties, however, Kim's career as a poet spanned almost four decades, and his writing evolved and transformed itself with the times. His work can be roughly divided into four periods. The first, which includes his works such as “A Flower” and “An Introductory Poem for a Flower”, focuses on the fundamental role of language and linguistics in attaining consciousness of any particular object's existence. The second period, which encompassed the late 1950s to the late 1960s, was filled with works that used description-oriented narrative images, imagery and aesthetic metaphor purely for imagery's sake. Word play, such as that in “Ballad Tone” (Tareongjo), was also prominent in Kim's works during these years.\n\nThe poem “The Heartbreak of Cheoyong” (Cheoyong danjang) signaled the beginning of the third period and a radical break with from his previous work. The poems of this period, rather than centering on the chimerical world of images that were the subject of his previous poetry, emphasized the other worldly, the plane beyond images. His fourth period of poetry, which encompasses his work 1970's until the early 1980s, was marked by Kim's musings and reflections on art and religion, into which he sought insight into their purpose for humanity and their relevance to the earthly life.\n\nKim won numerous awards including the second Korean Poets’ Association Prize, the seventh Asia Freedom Literature Prize, the Art Academy Prize, and the Culture Medal.

William's opposition to their marriage led to the unsuccessful Revolt of the Earls.\n\nEmma was first named Emma de Breteuil, born to William Fitz-Osbern and his wife Adeliza, the daughter of Roger I of Tosny and his wife Adelaide (the daughter of Ermesinde of Carcassonne, regent-countess of Barcelona). She was born in or around 1059 in Breteuil in Normandy. In 1075, Emma, Countess of Norfolk defended Norwich Castle when it was under siege. She eventually negotiated safe passage for herself and her troops in exchange for her castle. Emma died some time after 1096 on the road to Palestine during the First Crusade with her husband. Emma's granddaughter, Amice, married Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester.\n\nIn 1075 she married Ralph de Gael, an earl who resented the loss and power in comparison to his father. Her brother and husband then planned a rebellion against William the Conqueror but were betrayed. Her brother was then imprisoned for life by William but her husband escaped to Brittany leaving her to defend Norwich castle. Despite the odds against her, she refused to give in to the king's men. She organised the defense of the town for so long that William eventually had to compromise with her to restore peace. Part of the settlement included a safe passage for her to leave England and join her husband in Brittany.\n"}

As of the establishment of two new municipalities in Chiapas in September 2017, there are 2,448 municipalities in Mexico, not including the 16 \"delegaciones\" of Mexico City. The internal political organization and their responsibilities are outlined in the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution and detailed in the constitutions of the states to which they belong. are distinct from , a form of Mexican locality; some municipalities as large as states, while cities can be measured in city blocks.\n\nAll Mexican states are divided into municipalities. Each municipality is autonomous; citizens elect a \"municipal president\" (\"presidente municipal\") who heads a municipal council \"(ayuntamiento),\" responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. This concept, which originated after the Mexican Revolution, is known as a \"municipio libre\" (\"free municipality\"). \n\nThe municipal president is elected by plurality and cannot be reelected for the next immediate term. The municipal council consists of a \"cabildo\" (chairman) with a \"síndico\" and several \"regidores\" (trustees).\n\nIf the municipality covers a large area and contains more than one city or town (collectively called \"localidades\"), one city or town is selected as a \"cabecera municipal\" (head city, seat of the municipal government) while the rest elect representatives to a \"presidencia auxiliar\" or \"junta auxiliar\" (auxiliary presidency or council). In that sense, a municipality in Mexico is roughly equivalent to the counties of the United States, whereas the auxiliary presidency is equivalent to a township. Nonetheless, auxiliary presidencies are not considered a third-level administrative division since they depend fiscally on the municipalities in which they are located.\n\nNorth-western and south-eastern states are divided into small numbers of large municipalities (e.g. Baja California is divided into only five municipalities), and therefore they cover large areas incorporating several separated cities or towns that do not necessarily conform to one single conurbation. Central and southern states, on the other hand, are divided into many small municipalities (e.g. Oaxaca is divided into 570 municipalities), and therefore large urban areas usually extend over several municipalities which form one single conurbation. Although an urban area might cover an entire municipality, auxiliary councils might still be used for administrative purposes.\n\nMunicipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, supervision of slaughterhouses and the cleaning and maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1983, they can collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own collection efforts.\n\nSince the Conquest and colonization of Mexico, the municipality became the basic entity of the administrative organization of New Spain and the Spanish Empire. Settlements located in strategic locations received the status of city (the highest status within the Empire, superior to that of \"villas\" and \"pueblos\") and were entitled to form an \"ayuntamiento\" or municipality. After Independence, the 1824 Constitution did not specify any regulation for the municipalities, whose structure and responsibilities were to be outlined in the constitution of each state of the federation. As such, every state set its own requirements for a settlement to become a municipality (usually based on population). The Constitution of 1917 abolished the \"jefatura política\" (\"political authority\"), the intermediate administrative authority between the states and converted all existing municipalities into \"municipios libres\" (\"free municipalities\"), that is, gave them full autonomy to manage local affairs, while at the same time restricting the scope of their competencies. However, in 1983 the 115th article was modified to expand the municipalities' authority to raise revenue (through property taxes and other local services) and to formulate budgets.\n\nData from the 2015 Intercensal Survey by INEGI.\n\nData from \"Los Municipios con Mayor y Menor Extensión Territorial\" by the Instituto Nacional Para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal\n\nMexico City is a special case in that it is not organized as a municipality, but as a federal district as the capital of the federation. It is administered through the Government of the Federal District and it has its own unicameral Legislative Assembly. For administrative purposes, the Federal District is subdivided into \"delegaciones\", or boroughs. They are not identical to municipalities, but since 2000, they enjoy a certain degree of political autonomy since residents within a borough directly elect a local borough head of government (called \"jefe delegacional\"). However, boroughs do not form local [municipal] councils, are not constituted by a group of trustees, and do not have regulatory powers, most of which are exercised by the Federal District's government. Most public services are organized by the Federal District even if some responsibilities are carried out by the boroughs. Still, at the federal level, the boroughs are considered a second-level territorial division for statistical data collection and cross-municipal comparisons.\n\nOther municipalities in Mexico have chosen to use a similar administrative internal organization. All municipalities of Baja California are subdivided into boroughs, or \"delegaciones\". The municipality of Mexicali for example, is divided into 14 boroughs besides the City of Mexicali, which comprises the municipal seat and three additional metropolitan boroughs.\n\nThe Municipality of Santiago de Querétaro is subdivided into seven boroughs. Nonetheless, the heads of government of the boroughs are not elected by the residents but rather appointed by the municipal president. Unlike the boroughs of Mexico City, which are second-level administrative divisions, the boroughs of the municipalities are third-level administrative divisions.\n\n\n"}

On May 4, 2002, CKUE switched frequencies with its sister station CKSY to obtain its current frequency of 95.1 FM.\n\nCKUE began operating a synchronized on-channel rebroadcaster serving the nearby Windsor market, CKUE-FM-1, in March 2004 from an antenna mounted on the top of the 26-floor Solidarity Tower Co-Op apartment building on the city's east end. In 2005, Blackburn Radio acquired CKUE along with sister station CKSY. In September 2006, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved an application by Blackburn to move the Windsor signal from 95.1 to 100.7 MHz. This change allowed the Windsor and Chatham transmitters to increase their transmitter power.\nDuring the 2004-2005, and 2005-2006 seasons of the Ontario Hockey League, 95.1 provided live coverage of Windsor Spitfires games, with Shadd Dales on play-by-play and Brendan McGuire on colour.

Named WFCB-LP, the station broadcasts at just 100 watts at 81 feet above the ground, and may be subject to interference from CKUE-FM-1, due to its vastly higher power (3840 watts average, 9000 peak), and the fact that its antenna atop Solidarity Tower is adjacent to the Detroit River, and therefore, only a few hundred feet from the Canada–United States border (which sits in the middle of the river).\n\nIn the summer of 2018 the Cool-FM format was modified from Variety Hits to a rock-oriented Classic Hits direction.

In the Zig-Zag illusion, a magician divides an assistant into thirds, only to have them emerge from the illusion at the end of the performance completely unharmed.\n\nSince its invention in 1965 by magician Robert Harbin, it has been hailed as one of the greatest illusions ever invented due to both the apparent impossibility of the trick and the fact that, unlike many illusions, it can be performed while surrounded by spectators and withstand the scrutiny of audience members.\n\nHarbin was frustrated by his illusions being pirated by other magicians, and this inspired him to publish the method in his book \"The Magic of Robert Harbin\" (1970). The book was limited to 500 copies, and owners of the book were granted permission to build or have built the Zig Zag Girl (or indeed any other of the items in the book). The rights to the book and the Zig Zag illusion were then in time passed to The Magic Circle in the wake of Harbin's death. The concept of dividing a lady assistant into two or three parts was something that Harbin experimented with throughout his career before creating his ultimate divide, the Zig Zag Girl. Evidence of his fascination with this concept of dividing an assistant can be found in his earlier publications; the closest relative to the Zig Zag is the \"Little by Little\" illusion, which was also explained in \"The Magic of Robert Harbin\".\n\nHarbin's original Zig Zag Girl illusion is currently on display in The Magic Circle museum.\n\nThe assistant (usually a woman) is placed in an upright cabinet, her face, hands, and left foot visible through openings in the front of the cabinet. Large metal blades are inserted horizontally in the cabinet's midsection, dividing it—and presumably the assistant inside—into thirds. The magician then slides the cabinet's midsection apart from the top and bottom thirds, giving the appearance that the assistant's midsection has been pulled away from the rest of her, giving her a \"zig-zag\" shape. While divided, a small door on the cabinet's midsection can be opened to examine—even touch—the assistant's body inside, a duty frequently performed by an audience member brought up on stage to help perform the illusion. At the completion of the illusion, the assistant's midsection is slid back into place, the two blades removed, and she steps out of the cabinet unscathed.\n\nA number of magicians have begun performing variations on the basic illusion. In some, rather than the assistant's face being visible through a hole in the front of the cabinet, their entire head projects out of the cabinet through a hole in its upper surface. In another variation, rather than being divided into three pieces, the assistant is instead divided into five - This variation is commonly referred to as the \"Five-Way Zig-Zag\".\n\nThe method of this trick was partially explained by Masked Magician Val Valentino as part of a Fox TV series called \"\". The trick hinges on two things: that people will not suspect the woman is key for the trick to work, and that the box is larger than it appears. Details are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Early Diversion models had a four-stroke air-cooled 8-valve inline-four engine. In 2009 the model name was retained for a new range with 16-valve liquid-cooled engines.\n\nBefore the introduction of the 2009 models the series consisted of four main models; the XJ600S, XJ600N, XJ900S and XJ900GT and the lesser known YBR125 Diversion.\n\nThe XJ600S is known as the \"Diversion\" in most parts of the world but as the \"Seca II\" in the North American and Australian markets. The bike has a small top fairing although a lower fairing is available as an accessory. The XJ600S is a descendant of the XJ600 models manufactured between 1984 and 1991. It is fitted with a 598cc, air-cooled 8-valve inline-four engine producing and . The engine from the original XJ600 model was tuned towards improved low- and midrange power, sacrificing some peak power.\n\n600cc Diversion models were manufactured from 1992 to 2004. US Seca IIs were manufactured from 1992 to 1998. As the Diversion/Seca II design is based on an earlier, well-matured model, changes made to the bike during these years were rather subtle, mostly concerning improvements in fairing: a second front-brake disc and small oil cooler appeared on the 1998 model along with improvements to the carburettors.\n\nThe Diversion favours an upright riding position more than most 600cc sport bikes, making it usable for commuting. It remained in production for quite a long time, probably due to its low price, modest fuel consumption, longevity and reliability.\n\nThe XJ600N is almost identical to the XJ600S except that it is a naked bike and the instrument panel is different, as it turns with the handlebars. This model was not sold in North America.\n\nThe XJ900 is a descendant of the earlier XJ900 model. The XJ900S and the XJ900GT are both the same basic motorcycle except the GT,typically for touring motorcycles, has a large fairing and two Krauser K2 panniers while the XJ900S has a small top fairing like the XJ600S. On the dashboard (wider than that of the 600cc models) there are some extra gauges such as a fuel gauge. It is a sports/touring machine fitted with an 892cc, air-cooled 8-valve inline-four engine with and . The XJ900S/GT has a shaft drive while the 600cc models are chain driven.\n\nThe XJ900S/GT is known as \"Diversion 900\" on the European market. In the United States the bike appeared as the 1983 Seca XJ900RK.\n\nThe Yamaha Diversion has been used as a police motorcycle all over the world. Such models are built by Yamaha to the specifications of individual police departments. Generally the XJ900S is chosen for police use but the XJ600S has also been used. Police specification Diversions are commonly referred to as XJ900P (P for Police) although Yamaha refers to them by their usual model designation (XJ900S or XJ600S) as they do not constitute a separate model.\n\nIn 2009 Yamaha re-launched the Diversion line in the form of the XJ6 Diversion, XJ6 N and XJ6 Diversion F. The former has a half-fairing while the N version is a naked motorcycle. The fully faired FZ6R is the American equivalent to the European XJ6 Diversion F model with the exception of not having the ABS and electronic immobilizer. The engine is a detuned Fazer engine and both versions are offered with optional ABS braking. The new line has upgraded to a liquid-cooled 16 valve 4-stroke forward-inclined parallel 4-cylinder engine developing 78 horsepower (57 kW) / 59.7 Nm. Yamaha has kept the engine displacement at 600cc for the new Diversion line.\n\nThe YBR125 Diversion was also available in France around 2005\n\n"}

He also ran the famous Cotton Club and was a leading boxing promoter in the 1930s.\n\nOwen Vincent Madden was born into a working-class family at 25 Somerset Road in Leeds, England, on December 18, 1891, the son of Francis Madden and Mary Madden (née O'Neil.)\n\nIn search of work, the family moved first to Wigan, then to Liverpool, and it was Francis's intention to take the family to the United States, but he died before this ambition could be fulfilled. There is strong evidence (newspaper reports, prison registers and criminal records) that Francis Madden (\"alias\" Francis Summers \"alias\" Francis Summers Madden), an habitual petty thief and drunkard, remained in Leeds, where he died on March 11, 1932.\n\nIn 1901, Mary Madden sailed to New York on the RMS Oceanic to stay with her widowed sister, Elizabeth O'Neil, at 352 10th Avenue in Manhattan. Owen and his older brother, Martin, were left at a children's home, at 36 Springfield Terrace, in Leeds, until 1902, when Mary could finally afford passage for them. The family was reunited and found a home in amongst New York's long-established Irish community, which was to shape Madden's life permanently, giving him a reliable and loyal network among the thousands of other Irish emigrant families who had made New York their home.\n\nAfter serving seven years of a 10-to-20 year sentence for Manslaughter Madden was released on parole in 1923. The Gopher gang had broken up, and many members of his own faction were either in Sing Sing or working for bootlegging gangs.\n\nUpon his release he was given a job by an old friend, a former member of Madden's street gang who had moved up to better things. Larry Fay had a sharp mind for crime. He was not, however, the most physically imposing of gangsters and he needed Madden's muscle to help establish the taxi business he had set up from profits he had made running Canadian whisky across the border during the early days of Prohibition. Fay employed a gang of strong-arm men to help him gain control of the most profitable cab-stands along Broadway and Madden became their leader. Later Fay also became involved in New York's milk trade, attempting to turn its delivery into a racket.\nOwney Madden learned quickly and soon moved on to form his own organization.\n\nDuring this time, Madden employed a young friend as a personal driver. The driver, George Raft, later became a film star noted for his authentic portrayals of gangland figures.\n\nFay had used Prohibition as a means to raise money for other ventures, but Madden saw it as too good an opportunity to pass up, and soon became heavily involved in bootlegging, establishing a territory in the Hells Kitchen area. In 1924 the Madden gang began highjacking liquor shipments belonging to Big Bill Dwyer; but rather than go to war, Dwyer took Madden on as a partner when Dwyer decided he needed to beef up the enforcement side of his own operations.\n\nMadden and his former gang rival turned partner, Big Frenchy De Mange (George Fox DeMange), began to open or acquire some of the flashiest speakeasies and nightclubs of the era, most notably the legendary Cotton Club.\n\nMadden purchased the Club Deluxe from former Heavyweight Boxing Champion Jack Johnson and reopened it a year later. Nightclub patrons flooded into Harlem from downtown Manhattan to catch performers such as Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Lena Horne, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson and the Nicholas Brothers. \nMadden and his partners, Big Bill and Big Frenchy, also muscled their way into a piece of the exclusive Stork Club, where the influential gossip columnist Walter Winchell held court and everyone who was anyone wanted to see and be seen. As a celebrity with ownership in more than twenty night clubs, Madden became well-known and glamorized for his Prohibition-era activities. He also gained recognition for his revenge tactics and payoffs of City Hall.\n\nIn 1932, Madden was involved in the murder of Vincent \"Mad Dog\" Coll, who had been extorting money from several mobsters, including DeMange and Madden. After being arrested for a parole violation that same year, Madden began facing greater harassment from police and encroachment on his territory by Italian Mafia families, until he finally left Manhattan, New York City in 1935.\n\nLeaving behind racketeering, Madden settled in Hot Springs, Arkansas, which had become known as a haven for various criminals, with a corrupt city government and police force. He also became involved in local criminal activities, especially illegal gambling. The Southern Club became a popular nightspot for mobsters; Charles Luciano was apprehended there in 1936. Madden became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1943 and eventually married the daughter of the city postmaster. He lived in Hot Springs until his death in 1965.\n\n\n"}

Local participants would walk a total distance of across the tundra from Kivitoo, an old whaling station. Today the walk is much shorter than the original two and a half days, but it is still meant to promote hope among the community.\n\nThe community hosts a two-week celebration over the Christmas and New Year period every year. Visitors are warmly welcomed and encouraged to join the festivities and games.\n\nNear Qikiqtarjuaq was the home of FOX-5, a Distant Early Warning Line and now a North Warning System site.\n\nIn July 2011, Qikiqtarjuaq was featured in the BBC Radio 4 comedy series \"Cabin Pressure\".\n\nQikiqtarjuaq is situated off eastern Baffin Island. Davis Strait and Baffin Bay run to the east, and the Baffin Mountains are located to the west, more specifically the Arctic Cordillera mountain range. It is also one of the Nunavut communities closest to Greenland.\n\nIt is served by Qikiqtarjuaq Airport, , and a nine-room inn, the Tulugak Hotel. A nursing station and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachment provide vital resources for the community. The nursing station is composed of two nurses plus local volunteers and assistants and the RCMP station is a one-person detachment but sometimes hosts two officers.\n\nQikiqtarjuaq is a popular stop for pilots who fly smaller aircraft to and from Europe. The airport has a gravel runway that is well compacted, well cared for, cleared of snow daily, and lit. Qikiqtarjuaq is considerably closer to Kangerlussuaq, Greenland than Iqaluit (CYFB). The instrument approach minima for the non-directional beacon (NDB) approach at CYVM is relatively high (2,000 feet barometric, 1,982 AGL) due to high terrain surrounding the airport. An airport advisory service, Qikiqtarjuaq Airport Radio, (a Community Airport Radio Station [CARS]) provides assistance to pilots during normal business hours, and provides weather observation services. An automatic weather observation service (AWOS) operates when Qikiqtarjuaq Radio is unattended. The fuel supplier at the airport can assist with all ground handling arrangements, including transportation, parking, de-icing, and accommodations.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, construction began on the new airport terminal building, and a new municipal office will be built in 2011. There is also an access road that was built to Tisunaaq, also known as Ceetee Land to the Elders, and another road is proposed to Qikiqtarjuaqruluk, or Old Broughton, an abandoned settlement. Kivitoo, an old whaling station, is located to the north and is currently abandoned.\n\nThe community has been served by the Qiniq network since 2005. Qiniq is a fixed wireless service to homes and businesses, connecting to the outside world via a satellite backbone. The Qiniq network is designed and operated by SSI Micro. In 2017, the network was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice.\n\nQikiqtarjuaq has a tundra climate, with the warmest month averaging below .\n\n\n"}

Whilst at Hillsborough. Thome scored twice for Wednesday, once against Stockport County in the FA Cup and once against Wimbledon in the league.\n\nIn late 1999, with the Owls staring at the prospect of possible relegation in the face, he made the move to Chelsea for a fee of £2.7 million. He was to remain at Stamford Bridge for just nine months, as he found it hard to break up the tried and tested central defensive partnership of Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf. Thome was cup-tied for Chelsea's victorious 1999–2000 FA Cup campaign. He did however start when Chelsea memorably beat FC Barcelona 3-1 in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League quarter-final. Just one game into the 2000–2001 season Thome was sold to Premiership rivals Sunderland for a fee of around £4 million.\n\nDuring his time at the Stadium of Light, Thome struggled with injuries and Sunderland were reluctant to extend his contract. A clause in his contract with Sunderland meant that a considerable sum had to be paid to Chelsea after he played 50 matches. Sunderland were not willing to pay the extra appearance based fee, hence their reasons for not playing Thome towards the end of the 2002–2003 season, a campaign which ended in relegation. Thome scored twice for Sunderland, netting in league games against Coventry City and Aston Villa.\n\nIn August 2003, Thome joined Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer, and became a regular campaigner for the Trotters as they finished eighth in the Premier League and reached the League Cup final where they lost to Middlesbrough at the Millennium Stadium. In the summer of 2004, he moved to Championship side Wigan Athletic along with former Bolton teammate Per Frandsen. Thome was part of the Wigan side which were promoted to the Premier League for the first time in their history in 2005. His second season with the \"Latics\" saw him face less playing time which resulted in Thome being loaned out to Championship side Derby County for several months. Once the loan had expired with Derby County, he returned to Wigan Athletic where on the 7 February 2006, the \"Latics\" decided to release him from his contract. Following his release by Wigan, Thome joined Japanese side Vissel Kobe. He remained there for two seasons. In 2007, Thome announced his retirement from professional football.\n\nSince his retirement from playing football, Thome now works for Everton F.C. as a chief scout in Portugal since late 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In it, Clinton presents her vision for the children of America. She focuses on the impact individuals and groups outside the family have, for better or worse, on a child's well-being, and advocates a society which meets all of a child's needs. The book was written with uncredited ghostwriter Barbara Feinman.\n\nThe book was republished as a Tenth Anniversary Edition in 2006 and saw publication as a picture book in 2017.\n\nPublishers had approached Clinton since the spring of 1994 with the idea of writing a book, and announcement of the upcoming book came in April 1995 from the publisher she chose, Simon & Schuster.\nIt came in the wake of the Clinton health care plan of 1993, which she had led the effort for and which had suffered its final collapse in September 1994, and the book was seen by some observers as an effort to help reshape Clinton's image. It was not unusual for a First Lady to write a book while still in office, with Barbara Bush's children-aimed \"Millie's Book\" the most recent prior example. Eleanor Roosevelt was the first First Lady to write books while still in office, with the publication of \"It's Up to the Women\" in 1933, \"This Troubled World\" in 1938, and \"The Moral Basis of Democracy\" in 1940, among others. Carolyn Reidy, head of Simon & Schuster's trade books division, said \"We have all known that Hillary Rodham Clinton has devoted most of her career to issues of children. But outside of a handful of articles and speeches, her thoughts on these issues have not been available to everyone in an in an easily readable format. I think it will be an inspiring book.\" The book was originally intended to come out in September 1995, but delays on the part of Clinton resulted in publication being delayed until January 1996.\n\nIt was stated that Clinton would take no payments from the writing other than those to cover expenses, and that royalties from the book's sales would go to charity.\n\nIn January 1996, Clinton went on a ten-city book tour and made numerous television appearances to promote the book, although she was frequently hit with questions about her involvement in the Whitewater and Travelgate controversies.\nThe book spent 18 weeks on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller List during 1996 including three weeks at number one. By 2000 it had sold 450,000 copies in hardcover and another 200,000 in paperback.\n\nThe theme of the book, at least as perceived from its title, aroused immediate opposition within the United States. A well known instance of this occurred during the 1996 presidential election when, during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Republican Party nominee Bob Dole said: \"... with all due respect, I am here to tell you, it does not take a village to raise a child. It takes a family to raise a child.\" Criticism of Clinton's notion would continue to be made by American conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh, Andrea Tantaros, and Jonah Goldberg through the next two decades.\n\nIn 1997, Clinton received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for her audio recording of the book.\n\nIn 2005, Senator Rick Santorum wrote a rebuttal to the book, \"It Takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good\".\n\n\nThe book emphasizes the shared responsibility that society has for successfully raising children, by looking at a number of angles as indicated in the chapter titles noted above. Clinton describes herself in the book as a Moderate, which is evidenced by a combination of advocating for government-driven social reforms while also espousing conservative values.\n\nClinton notes in the book many institutions responsible in some way for raising children, including: direct family, grandparents, neighbors, teachers, ministers, doctors, employers, politicians, nonprofits, faith communities, businesses, and international governmental groups.\n\nSome of the goals and institutions that Clinton advocates for in the book include: the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Community Policing, the Brady Bill, Amber Alerts, immunizations, State Children's Health Insurance Program, financial regulation, expanded Child Tax Credits, Minimum Wage increases, Universal health care, personal responsibility, uniforms in schools, Goals 2000 academic framework, music warning labels, sexual abstinence, Plan B contraception, family planning, and marriage.\n\nThe book's title is attributed to an African proverb: \"It takes a village to raise a child.\" The saying and its attribution as an \"African\" proverb were in circulation before it was adopted by Clinton as the source for the title of her book. Indeed, the saying previously provided the source for the title of a children's book entitled \"It Takes a Village\" by Jane Cowen-Fletcher, published in 1994.\n\nThe authenticity of the proverb is debatable as there is no evidence that this precise proverb genuinely originated with any African culture. However, numerous proverbs from different cultures across Africa have been noted that convey similar sentiments in different ways. As one poster on the scholarly list H-Net wrote, \"While it is interesting to seek provenance in regard to the proverb, 'It takes a village to raise a child,' I think it would be misleading to ascribe its origin to a single source... Let me give a few examples of African societies with proverbs which translate to 'It takes a village...': In Lunyoro (Banyoro) there is a proverb that says 'Omwana takulila nju emoi,' whose literal translation is 'A child does not grow up only in a single home.' In Kihaya (Bahaya) there is a saying, 'Omwana taba womoi,' which translates as 'A child belongs not to one parent or home.' In Kijita (Wajita) there is a proverb which says 'Omwana ni wa bhone,' meaning regardless of a child's biological parent(s) its upbringing belongs to the community. In Swahili, the proverb 'Asiyefunzwa na mamae hufunzwa na ulimwengu' approximates to the same.\" \n\nIn 2016, NPR decided to research the origins of the proverb, and concluded it was unable to pinpoint its origins, but agreed with the H-Net discussion regarding it holding the true spirits of some African cultures. It was part of a class of such-attributed sayings, with one observer stating, \"If someone starts an aphorism with 'there's an African saying' it's probably a mythical quote misattributed to a whole continent.\" NPR itself concluded, \"What we found is that it takes a lot of phone calls to track down the origins of a proverb. And in the end, the answer might be: We just don't know.\"\n\nClinton has been criticized for not giving credit to a ghostwriter in connection with \"It Takes a Village\". The majority of the book was reportedly written by ghostwriter Barbara Feinman. When the book was first announced in April 1995, \"The New York Times\" reported publisher Simon & Schuster as saying \"The book will actually be written by Barbara Feinman, a journalism professor at Georgetown University in Washington. Ms. Feinman will conduct a series of interviews with Mrs. Clinton, who will help edit the resulting text.\"\n\nFeinman spent seven months on the project and was paid $120,000 for her work. Feinman, however, was not mentioned anywhere in the book. Clinton's acknowledgment section began: \"It takes a village to bring a book into the world, as everyone who has written one knows. Many people have helped me to complete this one, sometimes without even knowing it. They are so numerous that I will not even attempt to acknowledge them individually, for fear that I might leave one out.\" During her promotional tour for the book, Clinton said, \"I actually wrote the book ... I had to write my own book because I want to stand by every word.\" Clinton stated that Feinman assisted in interviews and did some editorial drafting of \"connecting paragraphs\", while Clinton herself wrote the final manuscript in longhand.\n\nThis led Feinman to complain at the time to \"Capitol Style\" magazine over the lack of acknowledgement. \nIn 2001, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that \"New York literary circles are buzzing with vitriol over Sen. Clinton's refusal, so far, to share credit with any writer who helps on her book.\"\nLater, in a 2002 article for \"The Writer's Chronicle\", Barbara Feinman Todd (now using her married name) related that the project with Clinton had gone smoothly, producing drafts in a round-robin style. Feinman agrees that Clinton was involved with the project, but also states that, \"Like any first lady, Mrs. Clinton had an extremely hectic schedule and writing a book without assistance would have been logistically impossible.\" Feinman reiterates that her only objection to the whole process was the lack of any acknowledgement. A 2005 Georgetown University web page bio for Barbara Feinman Todd states that \"It Takes a Village\" was one of \"several high-profile books\" that she has \"assisted, as editor, writer and researcher.\" Feinman Todd wrote more about the collaboration in her 2017 memoir \"Pretend I'm Not Here\".\n\nIn 2006, \"It Takes a Village\" was republished as a 10th Anniversary Edition with a new cover design and a new Introduction by the author that reflected on the continued meaning of the book in the Internet era and following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It also includes a new Notes section at the end that provides updates for scholarly studies that had been conducted in the intervening ten years. The role of Feinman remains unmentioned.\n\nClinton did not shy away from the book's conclusions during her post-First Lady political career. As part of her own presidential campaign during 2007 she said \"I still believe it takes a village to raise a child.\" And in her second presidential campaign during 2015 she said \"Fundamentally, [Republicans] reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called 'a village' that has a place for everyone.\"\n\nThe year 2017 saw public efforts under way to render \"It Takes\" as a picture book, an announcement that was made in February 2017. It was also announced that Marla Frazee, a two-time winner of the Caldecott Medal, would be the illustrator for the picture book; Frazee said in a statement, \"I am deeply honored to help bring Hillary Clinton's life's work and devotion to public service, which has inspired me and millions of others, to children and those who love them.\" As with the original book, any net proceeds from the picture book would go to charity.\n\nIn fact Clinton had entertained the notion of doing this for a number of years, and worked on it with Frazee during her 2016 presidential election campaign. The result was published on September 12, 2017, also the same day of publication as that for her account of her devastating loss in that election, \"What Happened\".\n\nThe book is aimed at preschool-aged children, although a few messages are more likely understood by adults, and contains some 117 words. \"The Washington Post\" characterized the work thusly: \"It captures perfectly Clinton's vision of a multicultural America working toward a constructive goal. So hopeful and forward-looking, the book might even be called 'What Didn't Happen.'\" \n\nA review of the book in the industry publication \"Shelf Awareness\" said that the picture book took a somewhat different perspective from the original, focusing more on the actions of children than of adults. The review especially praised the art work, saying that \"As with all of her works, Frazee's illustrations explode with life ... Her pencil-and-watercolor art is vibrant and action-packed, the story told entirely through her illustrations of the everyday ups and downs of the people working together to create something new and beautiful.\" \nThe book is parodied in Tim Wilson's 1999 song \"It Takes a Village to Raise a Nut\".\n\n"}

CFCO is one of the few dedicated country music stations on the AM dial in North America, as well as one of the few to do so in C-QUAM AM Stereo.\n\nThe AM radio station has been on the air since 1926. CFCO, which stands for \"Coming From Chatham Ontario\", featured middle of the road and adult contemporary formats through much of its history, moving to an oldies format around 1992, as Classic Gold 630.\n\nThe station made several upgrades during this period under the ownership of Bea-Ver Broadcasting, including an increase in nighttime power from 1,000 to 6,000 watts (the station broadcasts with 10,000 watts by day). The high quality of the AM stereo audio of CFCO was for a time even featured on a tuner manufacturer's website.\n\nIn 2000, the station added its FM signal at 92.9 (CFCO-1-FM) to improve reception of the station's programming in office buildings in Chatham. The FM simulcasts the AM 100% and initially broadcast with only 50 watts of power (later quintupled to 250 watts).\nOn March 3, 2008 at 9AM, after sixteen years as an oldies station, \"Classic Gold 630\" came to an end with the song \"The Beat Goes On\" by Sonny and Cher, after which CFCO signed on the new country format with \"Play Something Country\" by Brooks & Dunn. Opening the station was 32-year CFCO vet George Brooks. This is the first time Chatham-Kent has had its own country music station, although now-sister station CHYR-FM in nearby Leamington was a country station for most of the 1990s and sister station CJSP-FM, also in Leamington, debuted its own country format prior to CFCO's change.

{"id": "2308925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308925", "title": "Aublysodon", "text": "Aublysodon\n\nAublysodon (uncertain derivation; perhaps \"backwards-flowing tooth\"?) is a genus of carnivorous dinosaurs known only from the Judith River Formation in Montana, which has been dated to the late Campanian age of the late Cretaceous period (about 75 million years ago). The only currently recognized species, Aublysodon mirandus, was named by paleontologist Joseph Leidy in 1868. It is now considered dubious, because the type specimen consists only of an isolated premaxillary (front) tooth. Although this specimen is now lost, similar teeth have been found in many US states, western Canada, and Asia. These teeth almost certainly belong to juvenile tyrannosaurine tyrannosaurids, but most have not been identified to species level. However, it is likely that the type tooth (and therefore the name \"Aublysodon mirandus\" itself) belongs to one of the species in the genus \"Daspletosaurus\", which was present in contemporary formations, and which matches specific details of the original tooth. The synapomorphies alleged to distinguish the Aublysodontinae, especially lack of serrations on premaxillary teeth could have been caused by tooth wear in life, postmortem abrasion, or digestion. Most other \"aublysodontine\"-type teeth may be from ontogenetic stages or sexual morphs of other tyrannosaurids.\n\nApart from the type species \"Aublysodon mirandus\" over the years several other species have been named. These are now all considered either dubious or identical to other species or as having no close connection to \"A. mirandus\".\n\nIn the mid-to-late 19th century many dinosaur taxa were named for isolated teeth; such genera include \"Trachodon\", \"Palaeoscincus\", and \"Troodon\". Even before the badlands of North America started revealing the bones of \"Tyrannosaurus\", teeth turning up in many localities in the Western United States revealed the presence of large predatory dinosaurs.\n\nIn 1856 Joseph Leidy had named fourteen teeth collected by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden in 1854 and 1855 from the Judith River Badlands of Montana as the species \"Deinodon horridus\". In 1866 Edward Drinker Cope chose three nonserrated teeth from the original syntype series of fourteen as the lectotypes of \"Deinodon horridus\".\nLeidy named these same three teeth \"Aublysodon mirandus\" in 1868. The meaning of the generic name is uncertain because Leidy himself gave no etymology or explanation of the intended meaning. The genus name is derived from Greek αὖ, \"au\", \"again\", \"backwards\", \"contrariwise\", βλύζω, \"blyzo\", \"to spout\", \"to flow\" and ὀδών, \"odon\", \"tooth\". The specific name means \"wonderful\" or \"strange\" in Latin.\n\nBecause the name \"Aublysodon mirandus\" was based on the same type, it was at first a junior objective synonym of \"Deinodon horridus\", which latter name thus had priority. Cope in 1868 mistakenly thought the name \"Deinodon\" was preoccupied by the snake \"Dinodon\" and renamed \"Deinodon horridus\" into an \"Aublysodon horridus\". If \"Deinodon\" really had been preoccupied, this would have made \"Aublysodon\" a valid genus. In 1899 Oliver Perry Hay pointed out Cope's mistake; \"Aublysodon horridus\" is a junior objective synonym of \"Deinodon horridus\", just as \"Aublysodon mirandus\" had been. However, in 1892 \"Aublysodon\" became an independent genus when Othniel Charles Marsh further limited its type by choosing a single small nonserrated premaxillary tooth with a D-shaped cross-section, specimen ANSP 9535, as the lectotype of \"Aublysodon mirandus\". The two other teeth, ANSP 9533 and ANSP 9534, remained as the lectotypes of \"Deinodon horridus\". The names were thus separated.\n\nThe tooth-based taxon \"Aublysodon\" was a mystery for a long time since no further skeletal elements were found that could be assigned with certainty to the teeth. In the early twentieth century it was assumed by some workers that it represented a member of the Ornithomimidae when it was not yet known this group was toothless. Lawrence Morris Lambe in 1902 referred the tooth to \"Struthiomimus\"; Hay in 1930 renamed \"A. mirandus\" into \"Ornithomimus mirandus\", forgetting in that case \"Aublysodon\" would have priority.\n\nToday it is known that similar teeth are found in juvenile specimens of \"Daspletosaurus\", and it is likely that teeth referred to \"Aublysodon\" came from that genus. In October 2000, the type specimen of \"Aublysodon\" went missing when being sent by registered mail from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia to the Field Museum of Natural History. Because of the presence of \"Aublysodon\"-type teeth in other juvenile tyrannosaurines than \"Daspletosaurus\", such as those of \"Tyrannosaurus\", remains of which can also be found in Montana, Thomas Carr no longer considered the name to represent a real biological taxon, but to be a \"nomen dubium\".\n\nApart from \"Aublysodon mirandus\" and \"A. horridus\" several other species have been named within the genus. In 1876 Cope created an \"Aublysodon lateralis\", based on specimen AMNH 3956, a tooth of a juvenile tyrannosaur which has been synonymized with \"Deinodon horridus\". In 1892 Marsh named two more species: \"Aublysodon amplus\" and \"Aublysodon cristatus\", based on teeth YPM 296 and YPM 297 respectively. They may represent teeth from juvenile individuals of \"T. rex\" as they were found in the Maastrichtian Lance Formation. In 1903 John Bell Hatcher renamed \"Laelaps explanatus\" Cope 1876 into an \"Aublysodon explanatus\". This probably represents a tooth of \"Saurornitholestes\". In 1932 Friedrich von Huene classified a fragmentary skeleton named \"Ornithomimus grandis\" by Marsh in 1890 as \"Aublysodon grandis\", but most later researchers have considered this a synonym of the Campanian tyrannosaur \"Deinodon horridus\". In 1967 Alan Jack Charig named three species: \"Aublysodon lancinator\", \"Aublysodon novojilovi\" and \"Aublysodon lancensis\"; these had originally been species of \"Gorgosaurus\". The first two are today seen as juvenile specimens of \"Tarbosaurus\"; the last represents either a juvenile individual of \"Tyrannosaurus\" or a separate genus \"Nanotyrannus\".\n\nThe first skeletal material referred to an original \"Aublysodon\" species was a partial skull unearthed in Jordan, Montana in 1966 and described by Ralph Molnar in 1977/1978. The skull, specimen LACM 28741 at forty-five centimetres the length of an average human arm, bore pointed teeth attached to a long narrow snout. First thought to be a juvenile \"Tyrannosaurus\", then interpreted as a large dromaeosaurid, this \"Jordan theropod\" was given the name \"Aublysodon molnaris\" by Gregory S. Paul in 1988; in 1990 the name was by Paul emended to \"Aublysodon molnari\", applying the correct genitive. It was made a separate genus \"Stygivenator\" by George Olshevsky in 1995, but was later, in 2004, reinterpreted to be a juvenile \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" by Thomas Carr and Tom Williamson. Another partial skeleton from New Mexico, specimen OMNH 10131, was in 1990 considered to represent \"Aublysodon\", but later research by Thomas Carr and Tom Williamson first referred it to \"Daspletosaurus\" and ultimately to \"Bistahieversor\". In 1988 Paul also created another species when renaming \"Shanshanosaurus huoyanshanensis\" Dong 1977 into \"Aublysodon huoyanshanensis\". It probably represents a \"Tarbosaurus\" specimen.\n\nCope assigned \"Aublysodon\" to the Goniopoda in 1870, a group roughly equivalent to the modern Theropoda. Marsh however, in 1892 was misled by the small size of the teeth, their D-shaped cross-section and their lack of serrations into considering \"Aublysodon\" a mammal exceptionally large for the Cretaceous. By the early twentieth century it was again generally understood that \"Aublysodon\" was a theropod reptile; later it would be typically assigned to the Deinodontidae, a group today called the Tyrannosauridae.\n\n\"Aublysodon\" was by Paul in 1988 thought to belong to a unique subfamily of tyrannosaurids called the Aublysodontinae, a name already coined, together with an Aublysodontidae, by Franz Nopcsa in 1928. This was a concept which afterwards enjoyed some popularity: Thomas Holtz proposed a stem clade definition of the Aublysodontinae in 2001, \"\"Aublysodon\" and all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with it than with \"Tyrannosaurus\"\".\n\n\"Aublysodon\" was for a time also used in definitions of higher-level taxa. Holtz proposed a node clade definition of the Tyrannosauridae in 2001 as \"all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of \"Tyrannosaurus\" and \"Aublysodon\"\", using \"Aublysodon\" as an anchor taxon. Paul Sereno has also used \"Aublysodon\" as an anchor taxon for the Tyrannosauridae, although his definition was problematic for other reasons. These concepts have now been redefined without the dubious name.\n\nBecause \"Aublysodon\" is today considered a \"nomen dubium\" based on material probably belonging to \"Daspletosaurus\", its affiliations are likely tyrannosaurid and the terms Aublysodontinae and Aublysodontidae have become irrelevant.\n\n\n"}

Kushnir was murdered in 2005.\n\nAccording to some estimates, his ads reached 25 million users at his peak, between 2003 and 2004. Although only Muscovites were eligible to sign up, the ads went to many other countries, including Ukraine, the United States and Israel.\n\nOver the course of 2004, his output began to fall. He was almost completely forced off public email systems and resorted instead to using pager network ICQ. \n\nPublic opprobrium against him was so great that his personal information was widely posted throughout the internet. The country's deputy minister of communications, Andrey Korotkov, recorded a message urging Kushnir to stop what he was doing, and Golden Telecom, one of the country's larger Internet Service Providers, set up a computer that dialed ALC's telephone numbers continuously, playing Korotkov's message. The company's website also became the target of DDOS attacks, and its phone numbers were posted anywhere and everywhere on the Russian-language web, as contacts for anything from sex to cheap real estate.\n\nDuring 2002-2005, Kushnir and his company attempted to use RiNet ISP for connectivity, but was turned away numerous times and finally managed to connect via a neighborhood SOHO-styled company. It is worth noting that Kushnir did not send E-mail spam directly from his connection.\n\nA lawyer named Anton Sergo filed a complaint with the Antitrust Authority which oversees advertising in Russia. Kushnir, at first, snubbed the hearings until proceedings were started against him for noncompliance. He finally showed up and said he had no idea who was sending the ads. The complaint was dismissed.\n\nLegal sanctions against him weren't limited to Russia. In April 2001, the state of Kansas ordered him and an associate, Florida resident Michael Walker, to stop their spam-promotion of stock in Sophim Inc. on the grounds that not only was Sophim not registered at the time, but neither he nor Walker were licensed brokers.\n\nThose who knew him attributed his spamming, which his ALC partner disapproved of and which did not really generate much business for the center, to megalomania: \"He only did it because he was obsessed with it. He wanted to be somebody, to be recognized somehow. So he way overdid it.\"\n\nAccording to former employees, he was strongly influenced by Scientology and made hiring decisions based on the results of a 400-item questionnaire derived from a Scientology text.\n\nOn Sunday July 24, 2005, Kushnir was killed in the three-room apartment he shared with his mother on Sadovaya-Karetnaya Street in central Moscow. An autopsy determined that he had died after suffering repeated blows to the head. According to police, his apartment and personal belongings had been ransacked. They did not believe the killing was related to his spamming. Traces of a strong tranquilizer were found in a glass, so investigators theorize it was merely a robbery gone bad. \n\nLending credence to this theory, he was last seen alive as he was leaving the Hungry Duck in the company of three women who may have administered the fatal beating when he woke prematurely from his spiked drink.\n\nThe Russian media could scarcely conceal their glee at Kushnir's death, since his spam overloaded many of the country's inboxes. His spam, and others, had also led to many servers blocking all emails from the \".ru\" domain, hindering Russian users' ability to connect with the rest of the world. While he was not the sole source of Russia's spam problem, he personified it to many both within and outside Russia.\n\nIn August 2005, Russian media reported the Moscow criminal investigation directorate detained four people it claimed were involved in the homicide. The four claim Kushnir made sexual advances to one of them, a 15-year-old girl, then threatened another in the group who came to her defense. The latter then claimed to have struck Kushnir on the head in self-defense.\n\n\n"}

He entered King Richard's service in 1184, attacking and laying waste to lands of Aimar V of Limoges. In 1188 he managed seventeen castles captured from the Count of Toulouse. He accompanied Richard on the Third Crusade but was sent back when Philip Augustus left for France. On arrival he and his mercenaries defended Richard's estates in the latter's absence.\n\nAfter Richard's return from the Holy Land, Mercadier accompanied him everywhere as his right hand, travelling and fighting by his side. Richard eulogized Mercadier's exploits in his letters, and gave him the estates left by Ademar de Bainac in Limousin, who died without heirs around 1190. During the various wars between Richard and Philip Augustus of France, Mercadier fought successively in Berry, Normandy, Flanders and Brittany. When Richard was mortally wounded at the siege of Châlus in March 1199, it was Mercadier's physician who cared for him. According to one account, Mercadier avenged his death by storming the castle, hanging the defenders and flaying Pierre Basile, the crossbowman who had shot the king, despite Richard's last act pardoning him.\n\nMercadier then entered the service of Eleanor of Aquitaine, and ravaged Gascony and the city of Angers. On Easter Monday, 10 April 1200, he was assassinated while on a visit to Bordeaux to pay his respects to Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was bringing from Spain Blanche of Castile.

She participated in several battles of the War of 1812, including the Battle of Baltimore with the bombardment of Fort McHenry. She was converted into a polar exploration ship two decades later, and participated in George Back's Arctic expedition of 1836–1837, the successful Ross expedition to the Antarctic of 1839 to 1843, and Sir John Franklin's ill-fated attempt to force the Northwest Passage in 1845, during which she was lost with all hands along with .\n\nOn 12 September 2016, the Arctic Research Foundation announced that the wreck of \"Terror\" had been found in Nunavut's Terror Bay, off the southwest coast of King William Island. The wreck was discovered south of the location where the ship was reported abandoned, and some from the wreck of HMS \"Erebus\", discovered in 2014.\n\nHMS \"Terror\" was a bomb ship built over two years at the Davy shipyard in Topsham, Devon, for the Royal Navy. Her deck was long, and the ship measured 325 tons burthen. The vessel was armed with two heavy mortars and ten cannon, and was launched in June 1813.\n\n\"Terror\" saw service in the War of 1812 against the United States, during which the ships of the North America and West Indies Station of the Royal Navy blockaded the Atlantic ports of the United States and launched amphibious raids from its base in Bermuda, leading up to the 1814 Chesapeake campaign, a punitive expedition that included the Raid on Alexandria, the Battle of Bladensburg, the Burning of Washington, and the Battle of Baltimore. Under the command of John Sheridan, she took part in the bombardment of Stonington, Connecticut, on 9–12 August 1814. She also fought in the Battle of Baltimore in September 1814 and participated in the bombardment of Fort McHenry; the latter attack inspired Francis Scott Key to write the poem that eventually became known as \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". In January 1815, still under Sheridan's command, \"Terror\" was involved in the Battle of Fort Peter and the attack on St. Marys, Georgia.\n\nAfter the war, \"Terror\" was laid up until March 1828, when she was recommissioned for service in the Mediterranean Sea, but was removed from active service when she underwent repairs for damage suffered near Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nIn the mid-1830s, \"Terror\" was refitted as a polar exploration vessel. Her design as a bomb ship meant she had an unusually strong framework to resist the recoil of her heavy mortars; thus, she could withstand the pressure of polar sea ice, as well.\n\nIn 1836, command of \"Terror\" was given to Captain George Back for an Arctic expedition to Hudson Bay. The expedition aimed to enter Repulse Bay, where it would send out landing parties to ascertain whether the Boothia Peninsula was an island or a peninsula. \"Terror\" was trapped by ice near Southampton Island, and did not reach Repulse Bay. At one point, the ice forced her up the face of a cliff. She was trapped in the ice for ten months. In the spring of 1837, an encounter with an iceberg further damaged the ship. She nearly sank on her return journey across the Atlantic, and was in a sinking condition by the time Back was able to beach the ship on the coast of Ireland on 21 September.\n\n\"Terror\" was repaired and assigned in 1839 to a voyage to the Antarctic along with \"Erebus\" under the overall command of James Clark Ross. Francis Crozier was commander of \"Terror\" on this expedition, as well as second-in-command to Ross. The expedition spanned three seasons from 1840 to 1843 during which \"Terror\" and \"Erebus\" made three forays into Antarctic waters, traversing the Ross Sea twice, and sailing through the Weddell Sea southeast of the Falkland Islands. The dormant volcano Mount Terror on Ross Island was named after the ship by the expedition commander.\n\nBefore leaving on the Franklin expedition, both \"Erebus\" and \"Terror\" underwent heavy modifications for the journey. They were both outfitted with steam engines, taken from former London and Greenwich Railway steam locomotives. Rated at , each could propel its ship at . The pair of ships became the first Royal Navy ships to have steam-powered engines and screw propellers. Twelve days' supply of coal was carried. Iron plating was added fore and aft on the ships' hulls to make them more resistant to pack ice, and their decks were cross-planked to distribute impact forces. Along with \"Erebus\", \"Terror\" was stocked with supplies for their expedition, which included among other items: two tons of tobacco, 8,000 tins of preserves, and of liquor. \"Terror\"s library had 1,200 books, and the ship's berths were heated via ducts that connected them to the stove.\n\nTheir voyage to the Arctic was with Sir John Franklin in overall command of the expedition in \"Erebus\", and \"Terror\" again under the command of Captain Francis Crozier. The expedition was ordered to gather magnetic data in the Canadian Arctic and complete a crossing of the Northwest Passage, which had already been charted from both the east and west, but never entirely navigated. It was planned to last three years.\n\nThe expedition sailed from Greenhithe, Kent, on 19 May 1845, and the ships were last seen entering Baffin Bay in August 1845. The disappearance of the Franklin expedition set off a massive search effort in the Arctic and the broad circumstances of the expedition's fate were revealed during a series of expeditions between 1848 and 1866. Both ships had become icebound and were abandoned by their crews, all of whom died of exposure and starvation while trying to trek overland to Fort Resolution, a Hudson's Bay Company outpost to the southwest. Subsequent expeditions up until the late 1980s, including autopsies of crew members, revealed that their canned rations may have been tainted by both lead and botulism. Oral reports by local Inuit that some of the crew members resorted to cannibalism were at least somewhat supported by forensic evidence of cut marks on the skeletal remains of crew members found on King William Island during the late 20th century.\n\nOn 15 August 2008, Parks Canada, an agency of the Government of Canada, announced a C$75,000 six-week search, deploying the icebreaker with the goal of finding the two ships. The search was also intended to strengthen Canada's claims of sovereignty over large portions of the Arctic. Further attempts to locate the ships were undertaken in 2010, 2011, and 2012, all of which failed to locate the ships' remains.\n\nOn 8 September 2014, it was announced that the wreckage of one of Franklin's ships was found on 7 September using a remotely operated underwater vehicle recently acquired by Parks Canada. On 1 October 2014, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that the remains were that of \"Erebus\".\n\nOn 12 September 2016, a team from the Arctic Research Foundation announced that a wreck close to \"Terror\"s description had been located on the southern coast of King William Island in the middle of Terror Bay (), at a depth of . The remains of the ships are designated a National Historic Site of Canada with the exact location withheld to preserve the wrecks and prevent looting.\n\nSammy Kogvik, an Inuit hunter and member of the Canadian Rangers who joined the crew of the Arctic Research Foundation's \"Martin Bergmann\", recalled an incident from seven years earlier in which he encountered what appeared to be a mast jutting from the ice. With this information, the ship's destination was changed from Cambridge Bay to Terror Bay, where researchers located the wreck in just 2.5 hours. According to Louie Kamookak, a resident of nearby Gjoa Haven and a historian on the Franklin expedition, Parks Canada had ignored the stories of locals that suggested that the wreck of \"Terror\" was in her namesake bay, despite many modern stories of sightings by hunters and from airplanes.\n\nThe wreck was found in excellent condition, her decks and interior spaces largely intact. A wide exhaust pipe that rose from the outer deck was pivotal in identifying the ship. She was located in the same location where the smokestack from \"Terror\"s locomotive engine had been installed. The wreck was nearly south of where historians thought her final resting place was, calling into question the previously accepted account of the fate of the sailors, that they died while trying to walk out of the Arctic to the nearest Hudson's Bay Company trading post. \n\nThe location of the wreckage, and evidence in the wreckage of anchor usage, indicates continued use, raising the possibility that some of the sailors had attempted to re-man the ship and sail her home (or elsewhere), possibly on orders from Crozier.\n\nOn 23 October 2017 it was announced by British Defence Minister Sir Michael Fallon that the British government would be giving \"Terror\" and \"Erebus\" to Canada, retaining only a few relics and any gold, along with the right to repatriate any human remains.\n\nIn 2018, \"Terror\" and \"Erebus\" were gifted to Canada and the Inuit, in care of the Inuit Heritage Trust, by the government of the United Kingdom. This includes all the remaining artifacts.\n\nAlthough the exact location has not been released, Nancy Anilniliak, the Field Unit Superintendent of the Nunavut Field Unit, has restricted access to a rectangular area in Terror Bay. The area runs from Point E () to Point F () to Point G () to Point H ().\n\nIn August 2019, taking advantage of \"exceptionally co-operative\" weather conditions, Parks Canada conducted 48 dives over the course of seven days to \"Terror\", 3D-mapping the wreck and searching the interior with ROVs. The team was able to map out ninety percent of \"Terror\"s lower deck, but were unable to access Crozier's cabin due to the buildup of sediment. Despite this, Crozier's cabin was considered the best preserved space in the lower deck, and Parks Canada has expressed the hope that written materials may be found there.\n\nHMS \"Terror\" is featured, often alongside HMS \"Erebus\", in fictional works that involve or allude to the Franklin expedition, such as:\n\n\n\n"}

The highway extends from Grayson to Newport (a city in Kentucky across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Ohio), roughly paralleling the Ohio River between Vanceburg and Newport.\n\nMost of its path, from Grayson to the Interstate 275 loop in Wilder, is also known as the AA Highway (officially, the John Y. Brown Jr. AA Highway). KY 10 forms a branch of the AA Highway between Vanceburg and the Jesse Stuart Memorial Bridge in Grays Branch, near Greenup.\n\nThe AA Highway follows a general northwest-southeast orientation. For most of its length, the AA Highway is a two lane road that passes through a sparsely populated rural area of Northern Kentucky. While the highway passes through terrain that is rolling to hilly, the highway is generally level with moderate grades and no steep grades. Except for Carter County, all counties that the AA Highway passes through border the Ohio River. The only municipalities on the highway are Vanceburg and Maysville and suburban areas of Cincinnati at its western terminus. Those areas are also the only areas with any services used by motorists such as motels, gas stations, restaurants, convenience stores, etc. The only traffic signals on the AA Highway are near Maysville (along a commercial strip with many retail establishments and restaurants), suburban Cincinnati, and at its eastern terminus just north of Interstate 64 near Grayson. There are no rest areas on the AA Highway. Other than the portions that traverse the edge of Maysville and enter suburban Cincinnati, there are no shopping centers or major retail stores along the AA Highway.\n\nWhile the AA highway is not an expressway, it nonetheless serves as the shortest highway link between Cincinnati and Ashland, Kentucky. As such, it provides a link between Cincinnati and other Midwestern cities such as Chicago, Indianapolis, and Dayton and cities south and east of Ashland such as Huntington and Charleston in West Virginia, Charlottesville and Richmond in Virginia, and Charlotte and Winston-Salem in North Carolina.\n\nThe AA Highway is a rural two-lane highway for most of its length and traverses through some desolate terrain. Driver inattention and speeding, in combination with the numerous side road entrances and at-grade intersections have made it a dangerous and deadly road. To address these issues, guide signs comparable to interstate-styled signs have been installed along the highway at major intersections, along with additional overhead lighting. Other measures to improve safety and increase capacity are under consideration.\n\nThe AA Highway was envisioned as a modern highway from Alexandria to Ashland.\n\nConstruction began in 1985 on the first segment of the AA Highway. Estimated to cost $266 million to complete, it was designed primarily as a two-lane controlled-access facility. The first phase included the construction of of the AA Highway from the junction of Interstate 275 and Licking Pike (existing KY 9) in Campbell County east to Vanceburg. The first phase also included the design of two twenty-five mile-long spurs running east from Vanceburg, one ending at US 23 near Lloyd and the Jesse Stuart Memorial Bridge, the other ending near Interstate 64 in Grayson.\nWhen construction began, the costs for the first phase had risen to $292.7 million; the state had sold $300 million in bonds to pay for it. Segments of the highway, from Clarksburg just west of Vanceburg to Tollesboro was routed on an earlier relocated alignment of KY 10.\n\nIt officially opened in 1995, however, it was not formally dedicated until 2003.\n\nThe AA Highway including the Greenup spur was originally designated as KY 546, and the Grayson spur was signed as KY 694. On May 26, 1988, the designation, \"AA Highway,\" was proposed to be signed along with KY 546 and KY 694. A few years later, this designation was put in place with the AA Highway being co-signed with KY 546 and KY 694, however, many motorists were soon confused by the ever-changing designations.\n\nTo solve this issue, the AA Highway was renumbered in late 1995. The AA Highway including the Grayson spur was renumbered KY 9, and the Greenup spur was renumbered as KY 10. KY 10 also overlaps portions of the AA Highway throughout the entire highway's existence. Old KY 9 in Campbell county was renumbered as KY 915, and old KY 10 between Vanceburg and South Portsmouth was redesignated as KY 8.\n\nThe Kentucky Transportation Cabinet is proposing widening and correcting some deficiencies and addressing growing traffic concerns along the AA Highway from its western terminus near Covington to Maysville. Several options are being considered, such as: removing some of the at-grade intersections, widening to four lanes from two with partial control access, and full control access.\n\nThe AA Highway widening study was undertaken. Many residents and users of the road were concerned about intersection safety, while others discussed the high volume of traffic and the lack of passing lanes. Four alternatives were considered:\n\n\nTwo median types were considered: a concrete barrier wall and a depressed grass median. Mountable medians in rural areas are not recommended. With each median type option, there would be travel lanes and shoulders. The depressed grass median would be 40 to , separating the two opposing traffic flows effectively. Due to the high speed of travel, access control with a minimum of is recommended for the limited access alternate.\n\nAlso under consideration is using the existing alignment of the AA Highway as the eastward continuation of Interstate 74 from Cincinnati to Grayson, where it would connect with Interstate 64. This would necessitate adoption of Alternate Four described above.\n\n"}

It was said that Jōwa had great strength without equal. Historically he was accorded the title \"latter sage\" to match Dōsaku who was known as the \"former sage\". At some point in the Meiji Era this title was transferred to the more popular Shūsaku, as word was spread that Jōwa used the contacts that Hayashi Genbi had within the government to help him attain the Meijin Godokoro position. However, even without playing a sogo, Jōwa's strength was still apparent.\n\nLater on in his life, Jōwa also played one of the most famous games in Go history known as the \"Blood-vomiting game\". Gennan Inseki, a rival of Jōwa's who had seen the coveted position of Meijin godokoro snatched away from him through less than honorable means, persuaded a rapidly improving pupil of his, Akaboshi Intetsu, to play a game on black against Jōwa. Although Gennan, an 8-dan, would probably take black the majority of the time against Jōwa in a challenge match, he thought it would be more effective to have Akaboshi, a 7-dan, play against Jōwa. If Jōwa lost, he intended to argue that Jōwa could certainly not be qualified to be Meijin if he couldn't defeat a 7-dan. The match started with Jōwa making an unreasonably aggressive move in the fuseki, and Akaboshi countering with a variation of the taisha joseki that was developed secretly in the Inoue house. However, as the four-day-long game progressed, Jowa slowly clawed his way into the lead by playing three famous moves known as the \"Ghost Moves\". The three moves were supposedly brought to Jōwa by ghosts, allowing him to grind Intetsu's lead away.\n\nIn the end, Jōwa won, and as the stones were being cleared from the board, Akaboshi kneeled over the board and coughed up blood. Within a few weeks, he was dead. Gennan's tactics for discrediting Jowa's worthiness of being appointed Meijin backfired spectacularly, as this game was the supreme triumph of Jōwa's career.\n"}

However, cities ending in \"-kiškis\" are quite popular in the region. The city was first mentioned in 1499. At first it was Prince Kroszinski's residence, later count Tyzenhaus build a beautiful neogothic church of St. Matthias and Rokiškis Manor, which is well preserved today and houses the Rokiškis Regional Museum. The town was planned in a classicist manner.\n\nRokiškis was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania (Rzeczpospolita) until 1795, when Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire. Rokiškis was included in the Vilna Governorate until 1843, when the Novo-Alexandrovsk district (uyezd) was transferred to the newly established Kovno Governorate.\n\nThe city started to grow in 1873 when a branch of the Libau–Romny Railway was built which connected Dünaburg/Daugavpils to the east with the ice-free Baltic port of Libau/Liepāja.\n\nIn the summer of 1915, the German army occupied the city. When the war ended, the area became part of the new Republic of Lithuania. Rokiškis was granted city rights in 1920. Because of strained relationships between Lithuania and the nearby newly created Republics of Poland and Latvia, Rokiškis was economically isolated during the inter-war period.\n\nThe first arms for the city were designed in 1970 but were abolished the same year. The current coat of arms was approved in 1993 . The shield is divided into 4 quarters. 3 of the quarters depict 3 families that ruled the city: the candelabrum represents the Kroszinski family; the bull is a symbol of the Tyzenhaus family, and three bars and a fleur-de-lis are taken from the arms of the Przezdziecki family. The fourth quarter shows the impressive organ that is housed in the St. Matthias church.\n\nSituated on the Daugavpils-Liepaja railroad, during the 19th Century Rokiškis served as a commercial center for a large rural area and a point for the export of wood, grain, and flax. \nRokiškis is well known for its cheese. \"Rokiškio sūris\" is one of the largest cheese manufacturing companies in Lithuania. It grew from a small local dairy established in 1925 . In 1964 Soviets built a specialized factory. At present after reconstructions and foreign capital investments, its sales reach 400 million litas (about 155 million USD). 60% of the production are sold in foreign markets. The company is a very important employer in the region. It is also an important supporter of community initiatives.\n\nThere was a vibrant Jewish community in Rokiškis () for hundreds of years. The first Jewish settlement may have been prior to 1574 and was located at the present site of the old Jewish cemetery (about half a kilometer southwest from the market square) until the mid-1700s, when the community moved to the area near the market square and Kamai Street (now Respublikos gatvė). In 1847 there were 593 Jews in the town and in 1897 2,067 (75% of the total population).\n\nIn May 1915, during World War I, Jews in central Lithuania were forcibly deported to the east by order of the Czarist government. Although Jews in the Rokiškis area were not the subject of the deportation order, as the Russian forces retreated Cossacks serving in a rear guard capacity terrorized the Jews in northeastern Lithuania and most of the Jews in the Rokiškis fled to the interior of Russia. The Germans occupied Rokiškis until 1918.\n\nWhen World War I ended and the Republic of Lithuania was established, Lithuanian Jews were permitted to return home. The Jewish community of Rokiškis numbered 2,013 in 1923. Rokiškis developed rapidly after World War I, but under different economic conditions. Before the war, for example, Rokiškis could trade with nearby Dvinsk/Daugavpils/Dunaburg, Latvia, to which it was connected by a rail line. During the 1920s, however, Lithuania's border with Latvia was closed. As a result, trade increased with towns to the west which were connected by rail lines, such as Panevėžys/Ponevizh, Šiauliai/Shavli, and Kaunas/Kovno. (There was also a small gauge rail line to Pandėlys/Ponidel.) Prior to World War I, only 3 stores had been Christian-owned. After the war, however, many Lithuanians from surrounding villages came to settle in Rokiškis and open stores. Further, Lithuanian cooperatives came into being, trade in flax and produce was nationalized, and other factors caused a severe economic decline for the Jews. Many Jewish businesses went bankrupt in 1925 and between 1926 and 1930 many Jewish families emigrated to South Africa, the United States of America, and Palestine. In 1939 there were 3,500 Jews in Rokiškis (40% of the total population). They were mostly Chabad Chasidim. During the period of Lithuanian independence (1918–1940) there were two Hebrew schools.\n\nThe Soviets annexed Lithuania in 1940 and all Jewish businesses were confiscated. When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 21–22, 1941, Lithuania was quickly overrun. The Germans soon brought in special assignment squads to arrest and murder Jews. The Jews of Rokiškis and its environs were murdered in nearby woods just north of Bajorai, 400 meters east of the intersection of the northeasterly road to Juodupė and the northerly road to Lukštai. The official German army report (“the Jager Report”) states that on August 15–16, 1941, a total of 3,207 Jews were killed. Other Jews were deported to the ghetto of Joniškis and killed there.\n\nRokiškis is the birthplace of the commander of the Soviet Air Force and Hero of the USSR, Yakov Smushkevich.\n\nRokiškis is a member of the Douzelage, a town twinning association of towns across the European Union. As of 2019, its members are:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2309020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309020", "title": "Act of Violence", "text": "Act of Violence\n\nAct of Violence is a 1949 American film noir directed by Fred Zinnemann and adapted for the screen by Robert L. Richards from a story by Collier Young, starring Van Heflin, Robert Ryan and featuring Janet Leigh, Mary Astor and Phyllis Thaxter. The film was one of the first to address not only problems of returning World War II veterans but also the ethics of war.\n\nAfter surviving a Nazi POW camp where comrades were murdered by guards during an escape attempt, Frank Enley (Van Heflin), returns home from World War II. He is respected for his fine character and good works in the California town of Santa Lisa, where he, his young wife and baby had settled after moving from the East. What his wife does not know is that Frank moved them in an attempt to escape his past. His nemesis is Joe Parkson (Robert Ryan), once his best friend, who lived through the ordeal, but was left with a crippled leg. In exchange for food, Frank had alerted the Nazi camp commander to the prisoners' escape plans, thinking wrongly that the men would not be punished. Joe is now determined to exact justice on Frank, whose location he has learned from a newspaper story commending Enley for his civic endeavors.\n\nFrank's wife Edith (Janet Leigh) is completely in the dark about his past, and Joe's girlfriend Ann Sturgess (Phyllis Thaxter) knows everything about her man, but cannot dissuade him from his passion to set past wrongs right by seeing Frank dead. Frank must confront the truth about his actions\n\nDoggedly pursued by Joe, who stalks Frank's family at their house, Frank goes to a trade convention at a Los Angeles hotel, where Joe finds him, and they scuffle. Frank runs through downtown Los Angeles, ending up on Skid Row, where he is picked up by Pat (Mary Astor), who introduces him to a shady lawyer, Gavery (Taylor Holmes) and a hitman, Johnny (Berry Kroeger). A drunken Frank gives Johnny the information he needs to lure Joe into an evening meeting at Santa Lisa to kill Joe, the gunshot to be muffled by the noise of a train. \n\nAfter waking from his drunken binge, Frank regrets the deal and tries to warn Joe at the station. Johnny is waiting with a gun, but before he can shoot, Frank jumps between the gun and Joe. Although wounded, Frank manages to grab Johnny as he speeds off in his car, causing it to crash into a lamppost. Both Johnny and Frank are killed. Joe, realizing what Frank has done, kneels by his old captain and tells the surrounding crowd that he will be the one to tell Frank's wife about her husband's death.\n\nPrincipal photography on \"Act of Violence\" took place from May 17 to mid-July 1948, with added scenes shot in late August 1948. Filming on location, included scenes at Big Bear Lake, Big Bear Valley, San Bernardino National Forest, California, along with shooting at the MGM Studios in Culver City. Some of the nighttime city scenes were shot in the slum neighbourhoods of Los Angeles.\n\nOriginally adapted from unpublished story by Collier Young, before he embarked on a career as an independent producer with his future wife Ida Lupino, the film was intended to be a small, independent film. Howard Duff was to be the star, but when MGM picked up the rights, Gregory Peck was to be paired with Humphrey Bogart in the leading roles. Robert Ryan was lent to MGM by RKO Pictures for the production. \"Act of Violence\" was the third film made by Robert Ryan in 1948, following \"Berlin Express\" and \"Return of the Badmen\".\n\nDirector Fred Zinneman said that \"Act of Violence\" was the first film in which he felt he had full control of all the aspects of film-making.\n\nAccording to MGM records, \"Act of Violence\" earned $703,000 in the US and Canada and $426,000 overseas, resulting in a loss of $637,000.\n\nBosley Crowther, reviewing the film for \"The New York Times\", emphasized that it was a director's \"tour de force. For this latter asset of the picture, we have Mr. Zinnemann to thank. He has pictured, at least, a visual setting for terror and violence and he has kept the pursued and the pursuer going at a grueling pace. In the former role, Van Heflin strains and sweats impressively. As his relentless pursuer, Robert Ryan is infernally taut. Mr. Zinnemann has also extracted a tortured performance from Janet Leigh as the fearful, confused and disillusioned wife of the hunted man and he has got squalid portraits of scoundrels from Mary Astor, Berry Kroeger and Taylor Holmes.\"\n\n\"Variety\" gave \"Act of Violence\" a positive review, writing \"The grim melodrama implied by its title is fully displayed in \"Acts of Violence\"...tellingly produced and played to develop tight excitement...The playing and direction catch plot aims and the characterizations are all topflight thesping. Heflin and Ryan deliver punchy performances that give substance to the menacing terror...It's grim business, unrelieved by lightness, and the players belt over their assignments under Zinnemann's knowing direction. Janet Leigh points up her role as Heflin's worried but courageous wife, while Phyllis Thaxter does well by a smaller part as Ryan's girl. A standout is the brassy, blowzy femme created by Mary Astor – a woman of the streets who gives Heflin shelter during his wild flight from fate.\"\n\nFilm reviewer Roger Westcombe, writing for the \"Big House Film Society\", considers \"Act of Violence\" unsettling, and wrote \"\"Act of Violence\"...with a profundity, through its unsettling moral continuum, redolent not of Hollywood simplicities of good/evil but of the art one associates with Zinnemann’s European background. This contains a clue. Fred and his brother escaped their native Austria in 1938, but their parents, waiting for U.S. visas that never came, perished – separately – in concentration camps. The 'survivor guilt' this awful closing engendered must resemble the emotional see-saw ride which fiction like the ethical pendulum of \"Act of Violence\" can only start to expiate.\"\n\nCurrently, it holds a 90% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 10 reviews.\n\nFred Zinnemann was nominated for the Grand Prize of the Festival at the 1949 Cannes Film Festival for his work on \"Act of Violence\".\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

The Av Beit Din was known as the \"Master of the Court;\" he was considered the most learned and important of these seventy members.\n\nThe last Av Beth Din in Jewish tradition is Menahem the Essene who abdicated to \"serve the King\" in 20 BCE. Caiaphas was set to be next Av Beth Din but was opposed by the House of Shammai until Gamaliel became Nasi. Apparently the post of Av Beit Din was eventually filled, since the Babylonian Talmud states that Joshua ben Hananiah was Av Beit Din and Nathan the Babylonian was Av Beit Din. The Jerusalem Talmud tells the story of how Gamaliel II was deposed and Eleazar ben Azariah replaced him as Nasi. After Gamaliel was reinstated, Eleazar ben Azariah was made Av Beit Din. The parallel story in the Babylonian Talmud has Eleazar ben Azariah remaining as a co-Nasi with Gamaliel.\n\nIn modern times the title av beis din is often used as an honorific for the presiding rabbi of a \"beth din\" (rabbinical court), who is typically the salaried rabbi of the local Jewish community and usually a posek (\"decisor\" of Halakha). It is also abbreviated as \"AB\"D\" when it is after the name of the Chief Rabbi of a national Jewish community.\n\nIt can also refer to the most senior member of the court.\n\n"}

It describes a short delivery which is not especially fast, which is thus easy for the batsman to hit because he has plenty of time to observe the speed and direction of the ball after the bounce and choose his shot accordingly. In contrast, a fast short delivery which bounces high (to the batsman's chest or higher) is termed a bouncer and is often bowled deliberately because it is difficult to hit safely, due to the height at which it reaches the batsman.\n\nA fast ball which pitches short but (due to the vagaries of the wicket surface) does not bounce high is very difficult to defend against, for the batsman will usually expect the ball to bounce high in this situation; this can often lead to the batsman being out bowled or lbw when they leave a ball which appeared to be rising over the stumps but stayed low. Such deliveries are not called long hops, due to the difficulty they cause the batsman.\n\nThe term 'long hop', like the term 'full toss', has passed into slang as a description of an argument or insult which is easily refuted or responded to.\n"}

{"id": "2309038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309038", "title": "Formula Atlantic", "text": "Formula Atlantic\n\nFormula Atlantic is a specification of open-wheel racing car developed in the 1970s. It was used in professional racing through the IMSA Atlantic Championship until 2009 and is currently primarily used in amateur racing through Sports Car Club of America Formula Atlantic.\n\nThe history of Formula Atlantic begins with the SCCA Formula B class, created in 1965 for single-seat formula cars with engines not exceeding 1600cc in capacity. Prior to Formula Atlantic, professional Formula B races were held in the United States from 1965 to 1972, firstly with the SCCA's poorly supported Formula A, then as part of the SCCA Grand Prix Championship in 1967 and 1968 and then in their own independent series from 1969 to 1972.\n\nFormula Atlantic as a class evolved in the United Kingdom in 1971 from the US Formula B rules, with 1600cc production-based twin-cam engines (initially Cosworth Mk.XIII based on Lotus-Ford Twin Cam and then Cosworth BDD, however other engines like Alfa Romeo were also eligible). Conceived by John Webb of Brands Hatch (who would later also develop the Sports 2000 class) as a category for national competitors with the performance near a Formula Two car but running costs at or below that of a contemporary Formula Three car. A single Yellow Pages championship ran in 1971-2, with a rival BP backed series appearing in 1973. 1974 saw the BP series changing sponsor to John Player, and the Yellow Pages series becoming backed by John Webb's MCD organisation and Southern Organs; in practice most top drivers competed in both series and there were no date clashes. Only one series ran in 1975-6, in the final year taking the title \"Indylantic\" and adopting Indianapolis-style single-car qualifying. But the formula was under threat from Formula 3 and no series ran in 1977-78. A BRSCC-organized club racing series returned in 1979 with initial backing from Hitachi and continued to 1983, with diminishing grids and few new cars appearing.\n\nAs a result of its similarity to Formula 2 and Formula 3 in terms of chassis regulations, Formula Atlantic typically used chassis closely related to these cars—with performance somewhere in between the two—so most of the manufacturers were familiar from those classes, particularly the likes of Brabham, Lotus, March, Chevron early on, with Ralt and then Reynard later. US manufacturer Swift came to displace the British imports and dominate in North America. Several smaller marques also appeared.\n\nThe first professional races run under Formula Atlantic rules in North America were conducted in 1974 by the CASC in Canada (now ASN Canada), drawing much attention and large fields due to its national CTV television coverage. IMSA in the United States took advantage of the large number of teams and organized their own series in 1976.\n\nDuring these years, the series attracted guest drivers from Europe, including Formula One, particularly at the Trois-Rivières street race in Quebec, Canada. Guest drivers included James Hunt, Jean-Pierre Jarier, Riccardo Patrese, Patrick Depailler, Jacques Laffite, Didier Pironi and Vittorio Brambilla.\n\nIn 1977, the SCCA sanctioned the US events and in 1978 the CASC and SCCA series merged, and conducted the series jointly until 1983, when it ran as the \"Formula Mondial North American Cup\" and was won by Michael Andretti. The series could not sustain the success of earlier seasons and was cancelled for 1984. Formula Mondial was an international category introduced by the FIA in 1983 with the intention of replacing both Formula Atlantic and Formula Pacific, the latter being a variant of Formula Atlantic that had been introduced in a number of Pacific Basin countries in the late 1970s.\n\nSCCA Formula Atlantic cars are allowed wings and ground effects. They use either the Toyota 4AGE engine or the Cosworth BDD. Cars meeting Super Vee specifications were also allowed but are now rarely seen. Prior to 2006 these rules were also largely used in the professional series except that all cars had to run a Fuel Injected 4AGE. This meant that competitive amateur teams could also participate in professional races and that old pro series equipment could be raced at the amateur level. However, in 2006 the pro series introduced a spec chassis, the Swift Engineering 016.a and a new spec engine, the Mazda-Cosworth MZR. The result was that the cars used in the pro series were drastically different than the amateur cars. In 2009, to shore up small race fields, the pro series introduced a \"C2 class\" for amateur level cars, primarily the Swift 014.a, the dominant chassis in amateur competition at the time. However the C2 class saw few entries and was abandoned in the middle of the season.\n\nSince 2011 SCCA Club Racing has allowed the Swift 016.a and Mazda-Cosworth MZR, albeit with an inlet restrictor to maintain parity with the older Toyota-powered cars. As of 2017 most nationals competitors were running the 016.a-Mazda combination. Also eligible for the class are Mazda rotary powered cars made for the Pro Mazda Championship. In 2018 the professional series will switch to a new car and all of the rotary cars will be available for club racing use, although they appear to not be competitive with cars built to the FA specification, even older ones. Additionally, in 2019 the SCCA will allowed sealed Mazda MZR engines to be used in older chassis, such as the Swift 014.a, as parts availability for the Toyota engines has become an issue.\n\nThe minimum weight of a Toyota or BDD powered Atlantic car is 1230 lbs. (558 kg) with driver. The SCCA considers it its fastest club racing class. Prior to gaining its own class, the Formula SCCA car raced in Formula Atlantic, where it was uncompetitive.\n\nWith the end of the IMSA and Champ Car sanctioned professional Atlantic Championship after the 2009 season, the promoters of the F2000 Championship Series, Formula Race Productions, promoted a new pro series in 2012 using SCCA rules and sanctioned by the SCCA. The series saw few entrants and folded after one season. However, due to increasing interest at the amateur level, on October 1, 2013, it was announced that the series would return in 2014 with a twelve race, six weekend race calendar. Sanctioning will transition to the United States Auto Club in 2017.\n\nIn 2012 and 2014, the Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion historic automobile racing event at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in Monterey, California had a tribute to Formula Atlantic as a part of its scheduled groups.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2309042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309042", "title": "Marvel Land", "text": "Marvel Land\n\nIn \"Marvel Land\", the player must take control of Prince Paco (Talmit in English), who's on a quest to save Princess Luxie (Wondra in English) from the evil Mole King (Japanese: 魔王モウル; \"Maō Mōru\"); the gameplay is similar to that for Nintendo's \"Super Mario Bros.\". Powerups include dragon wings which allow Prince Paco to jump higher and fly (to a certain extent), shoes that can allow him to walk faster for a while, and a clone powerup which allows him to whip multiple copies of himself at enemies in a line - and collecting these powerups makes it easier for Prince Paco to defeat enemies and collect various items to increase his score. Each of the game's four worlds take place in an amusement park (which is the eponymous \"Marvel Land\"), and most areas are set outside with various obstacles that must be overcome; other areas include a ride on a roller coaster, and even a walk through a funhouse. At the end of the regular outside levels, Prince Paco must jump through a huge target to earn between 100 and 7650 (Namco's goroawase number) extra points - and his remaining time will also then be added.\n\nThe game's enemies are an army of moles known as \"Mogles\", and a wide range of other creatures; a boss must also be fought at the end of the last area of all four worlds. They are unique in that they are played more like a minigame (rock paper scissors for Worlds 1 and 4, and tug of war for Worlds 2 and 3). After Prince Paco defeats a boss he rescues a fairy (Princess Luxie after he defeats the Mole King), and is treated to a bonus stage where he must catch falling stars for points in a float parade at night - and some rides featured in areas, along with the bonus stage parade floats contain several of Namco's earlier characters, such as: \"Pac-Man\" (1980), Pooka from \"Dig Dug\" (1982), Solvalou from \"Xevious\" (1982), \"Mappy\" (1983), \"Grobda\" (1984), Gilgamesh and Ki from \"Tower of Druaga\" (1984), Paccet from \"Baraduke\" (1985), Valkyrie of \"Valkyrie no Bōken\" (NES, 1986), \"Wonder Momo\" (1987), Amul (in \"one-headed\" form) from \"Dragon Spirit\" (1987) and \"Beraboh Man\" (1988). The pink-and-silver female robot who appears at the start of each world, also appears in the Namco System 12-era \"World Stadium\" games as the Nikotama Gals' catcher and in the \"Namco Museum\" series at the information desk.\n\nAfter Prince Paco has beaten the Mole King at his minigame, he will state \"BLAST! YOUR POINT ARE MORE THAN MINE! THE \"POKA-SUKA\" SLOT IS YOURS. BUT, I CAN'T RECOGNIZE YOUR WIN BY SUCH A WAY! HERE COMES SEVERE FIGHT!\" and the game will take on the normal \"final boss\" theme; at this time, the chances of Prince Paco's victory are proportional to how many bosses he had defeated earlier. This game features a lot of secret warp areas that allow the player to bypass most of the game (just like with \"Super Mario Bros.\") - but defeating each of the three previous bosses grants the player three powerful \"Trident Crystals\", which are required to beat the Mole King in the final battle. It is also worth noting that even if Prince Paco manages to defeat the Mole King (and rescue Princess Luxie), he shall also still have to escape with her in tow; however, he only has \"one\" chance to do so, because he will have received 1000000 points for all his remaining lives (except his last one) after the Mole King was defeated. As a result, this is probably the hardest Namco game to get to the end of.\n\nIf the player selects Digest in the difficulty, most of the stages in different worlds will be skipped up from World 1 Area 1 through World 1 Area 7, World 2 Area 1 until World 2 Area 6 and World 3 Area 2 until World 4 Area 6 and Prince Paco will fight lesser enemies and can only rescue Florie and Princess Luxie (excluding Sylphie and Sweetie) in that mode.\n\nThe characters of the game consisted of both Prince Paco and Bunny as the two characters are the ones to rescue the fairies including Princess Luxie from their respective worlds. In Digest Mode, Prince Paco will rescue both Florie and Princess Luxie as most stages from World 1 to World 4 were skipped while facing lesser enemies.\n\nPrince Paco (Talmit in English) is the main protagonist of Marvel Land where he was chosen to rescue the fairies from their respective worlds including Princess Luxie at the hands of the Mole King. After defeating the Mole King and rescuing the Princess the two escaped the premises as he also witnessed Luxie using the blue Trident crystal ball to clear up the entire the Marvel Land.\n\nBunny is one of Prince Paco's friends who warns him about the Mole King's world conquest in taking over Marvel Land and for capturing Princess Luxie and the fairies. She also serves as the referee in the minigames when Prince Paco fights the respective bosses.\n\nFlorie (Flora in English) is the fairy from the first world and carries the yellow Trident crystal ball as she and the rest of the fairies including Princess Luxie were captured by the Mole King. She was the first fairy to be rescued by Prince Paco once he defeated The Great Condor in a Rock-Paper-Scissors minigame and she gives the yellow Trident crystal to Paco as a token of gratitude. \n\nFlorie' name is the access password for World 1 Area 7.\n\nSylphie (Sirca in English) is the fairy from the second world and carries the green Trident crystal ball. She and the rest of the fairies including Princess Luxie were captured by the Mole King. She was the second fairy to be rescued by Prince Paco once he overpumps the water balloon and pops and splash onto the Demon Mogle's big boss with water from the balloon during the air pumping game and she gives the green Trident crystal to Paco as a token of gratitude.\n\nSylphie's name is the access password for World 2 Area 7.\n\nSweetie is the third fairy from the third world similar to the candyland and carries the pink Trident crystal ball. She and the rest of the fairies including Princess Luxie were captured by the Mole King. She was the third fairy to be rescued by Prince Paco by defeating Princess Demon Ala Mode in a racing card game and she gives the pink Trident crystal to Paco as a token of gratitude. She is the only character to retain her original name in both English or Japanese.\n\nSweetie's name is the access password for World 3 Area 7.\n\nPrincess Luxie (Wondra in English) is the Princess who lives in the fourth world and the person who carries the blue Trident crystal ball as her Trident symbol is yellow which is different than the other fairies' Trident symbols being red from their respective crystal. Unlike most fairies being captured by the Mole King, Luxie ends up being knocked unconscious during Mole King's captivity. She was the last person to be rescued by Paco by beating the Mole King in a musical Whack-A-Mole minigame and an actual boss fight. She is temporarily became a playable character in the fifth world where she and Prince Paco escape and she was dragged by him while running and jumping to avoid the falling debris or getting fall into the burning charcoals until they reach through the dark clouds while whited out in the flash of light. At the ending, she uses the blue Trident crystal to clear up the entire Marvel Land.\n\nLuxie's name is the access password for World 1 Area 2.\n\nThe Great Condor is a purple condor who serves as one of the Mole King's adversaries who wields the hammer. He was the first boss to be fought on World 1 Area 7 in order for Prince Paco to rescue Florie in the Rock-Paper-Scissors minigame. He ends up defeated by Paco when he wins the minigame.\n\nHis name species Condor is the access password for World 1 Area 6.\n\nDemon Mogle is the chameleon-like demon who serves as one of the Mole King's adversaries. He is the second boss to be fought at World 2 Area 7 in order for Paco to rescue Sylphie in the air pumping minigame. He will be defeated once Paco pops the opponent's water balloon to splash the Demon Mogle's big boss with water in humiliation after overpumping the entire water balloon.\n\nHis name is the access password for World 2 Area 6.\n\nPrincess Demon Ala Mode is a demon princess who serves as one of the Mole King's adversaries. She is the third boss to be fought at World 3 Area 7 in order for Paco to rescue Sweetie in the racing card game. She can be defeated if Paco quickly manages to get the matching cards three times.\n\nHer name is the access password for World 3 Area 6.\n\nMole King (Japanese: 魔王モウル; \"Maō Mōru\") also known as King Mole or King Demon Mole is the main antagonist and final boss of the game who is responsible for capturing the world fairies including Princess Luxie for his world conquest in taking over Marvel Land. He was fought twice as the last and final boss in World 4 Area 6 where Prince Paco needs to defeat him first in a musical Whack-A-Mole minigame and an actual boss fight where he can zap lasers with his staff and randomly charges his opponent. Paco carries the three Trident crystals in order to defeat him and rescue Luxie. Once Paco defeats him for the second time, he was blown away with a white smoke in explosion.\n\nHis name species Mole is the access password for World 1 Area 3.\n\nMarvel Land reappears as the setting of one of the chapters of the 2015 Nintendo 3DS game, \"Project X Zone 2\". The game's party ends up visiting the park due to the park's name being confused with Marvel Land from \"Valkyrie no Bōken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu\". The game also showed up as an occasional Video Challenge on the early-1990s Nickelodeon game show Nick Arcade.\n\n"}

He made his debut in sumo in 1769 when he was 19. With a height of 189 cm and a weight of 169 kg, he was extremely large in comparison with most Japanese men of his era.\n\nIn this period, local men with a large physique but often little to no sumo background were asked to enter sumo tournaments. They would debut as \"kanban\" or \"guest\" \"ōzeki\" and in most cases their \"careers\" were short-lived. This is how Tanikaze, due to his size, debuted in 1769. He chose to stay active in sumo however, and would eventually be promoted to a true \"ōzeki\" outright in March 1781. From October 1777 until February 1786, he lost only one bout. This was to Onogawa in February 1782. He recorded the longest run of consecutive victories in sumo bouts at that time, with 63. This record remained unbroken for about 150 years, until Futabayama in 1938.\n\nOn November 19, 1789, he became one of the first two sumo wrestlers to be allowed to perform a \"yokozuna dohyō-iri\" (a special ring-entrance ceremony for the \"yokozuna\" alone, rather than entering as part of a parade of the top ranked wrestlers). Both he and Onogawa were granted a special so-called \"yokozuna\" license simultaneously in that year. Officially he is recorded as being the 4th \"yokozuna\" in sumo history. However, as the first three (see list of yokozuna), if indeed they existed at all, were awarded the title posthumously, he can be said to be one of the first two real holders of the title.\n\nHe was still an active wrestler when he died at the age of 44 of influenza. He was on another winning streak of 35 bouts at the time of his death. In the top \"makuuchi\" division, Tanikaze won 258 bouts and lost only 14 bouts, achieving a winning percentage of 94.9.\n\nTanikaze was a very popular \"rikishi.\" Unlike other wrestlers of his day, many \"nishikie\" (woodblock print based) portraits and images of him participating in bouts still remain.\n\n \n \n\n\"*Championships for the best record in a tournament were not recognized or awarded before the 1909 summer tournament, and the unofficial championships above are historically conferred.

With a population of 82,227 (),\nit is the fourth largest city in the Province, after Posadas, Oberá, and Eldorado.\n\nThe world-renowned Iguazú Falls are only away from the city, and as a result the city has developed much of its infrastructure around tourism.\n\nSpanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca became, in 1542, the first European to discover what are now called Iguazú Falls. He was drawn by the noise of the water, which can be heard at a distance of several kilometers. When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the Guaraní people were the principal inhabitants of the area.\n\nDespite its early exploration, the area remained occupied only by the Guaraní Indians until 1880. Corrientes Province, which at that time included what is now Misiones, sold 50 square leagues () at the current site of Puerto Iguazú near the falls in 1881. The land changed hands three times in the course of just two years, and ended up as the property of Gregorio Lezama. At that time Misiones separated from Corrientes. Lezama funded a scientific expedition to explore the territory, enlisting Carlos Bosetti and Jordan Hummel for that purpose. Those two explorers later organized the first tourist trip to the falls; Lezama sold the land in 1888 to Martín Errecaborde and Company.\n\nTerritorial Governor Rudecindo Roca established Iguazú Department, one of 5 initial subdivisions in Misiones, in 1882. A Justice of the Peace, Alberto Mujica, was assigned to the area in 1897. The firm of Gibaja y Núñez opened the town's first hotel at this time to serve the growing numbers of tourists visiting Iguazú Falls. One of these, Victoria Aguirre, funded the first road into the town in 1901 as well as other civic improvements, and it was in her honor that on September 10, 1902, the settlement was formally established as \"Puerto Aguirre\". A police department (1913), a civil registrar (1916), and a post office (1928) followed.\n\nThe Iguazú National Park was established as such by the national government in 1934, and in 1943 the town was renamed \"Puerto Iguazú\". The Tancredo Neves Bridge, connecting the city with neighboring Foz do Iguaçu (Brazil), was opened in 1985.\n\nPuerto Iguazú has a Humid Subtropical climate (Cfa according to Köppen climate classification). Temperatures are warm in winter and hot in summer. There is no dry season and rainfall is abundant with every month receiving over 100 mm (3.9 inches) of rain and the wettest month, November, receiving over 200 mm (7.9 inches) of rain on average. Precipitation falls mostly during convective storms. Due to abundant rainfall, rainforests surrounds Puerto Iguazú.\n\nThe hot season lasts for up to 6 months or more, with temperatures reaching between 30 °C (86F) and 35 °C (95F) on most days, and dropping to 18 °C (64F) to 24 °C (75F) at night. Thunderstorms with heavy rains bring relief when the heat becomes too intense.\nThe cool season runs from late April to mid September, with daily highs reaching an average of 21 °C (70F) and a low of 11 °C (52F) in June. These averages are reached through an alternating weather pattern, with several days with northerly winds and temperatures of around 28 °C (82F) or higher and warm nights over 15 °C (59F) giving way, in a very sudden manner, to cool, rainy weather and temperatures between 10 °C and 15 °C (50F to 59F) for a few days, then to dry, sunny weather and colder nights (around 5 °C, or 41F, and sometimes much lower) and pleasant days in the 15 °C to 20 °C (59F to 68F) range, and a gradual increase in temperatures as winds rotate to the north again.\nFrost is rare but does occur on some winters, and temperatures within a few degrees of freezing occur every winter. The record low is -4.9 °C (23.1F), a surprisingly low value given the latitude, the vegetation and the low elevation of the area.\n\nTemperatures above 40 °C (104 °F) have been recorded in the summer.\n\nThe economy is centered around tourism, given that the city's many hotels provide the principal source of jobs for its inhabitants. Many international hotels have been and are being constructed along the banks of the Iguazú River.\n\nOther of the city's tourist attractions include Three Frontiers, where the Argentine, Paraguayan and Brazilian borders meet. Puerto Iguazú is home to an active community of artisans, the La Aripuca resort, the Museum of Images of the Jungle (a collection of woodcarvings), the Mbororé Museum, the Luis Honorio Rolón Municipal Nature Park, the Güira Oga Center for Bird Rehabilitation, the Hotel Esturión, the Iguazú Grand Hotel and Casino, the Amérian Portal del Iguazú, and, south of Puerto Iguazú, the Sheraton Iguazú Resort & Spa.\n\nThe nearby Wanda Mines also attract gemstone and geode collectors. Operating since the 1950s, the mines are the site of some of Argentina's best agate, amethyst, quartz and topaz lodes.\n\nThe Tancredo Neves International Bridge links Puerto Iguazú with the Brazilian border town of Foz do Iguaçu, where the Argentine National Route 12 becomes the Brazilian BR-469. From the main bus station one can take taxis, or the municipal bus, one of whose routes run from the Three Frontiers to Iguazú National Park (\"Parque Nacional de las Cataratas\").\n\nThe city is served by its own international airport, Cataratas del Iguazú International Airport, as well as by Foz do Iguaçu International Airport on the Brazilian side of the border.\n\nThe municipality contains the Iguazú National Reserve, created in 1970.\nOne of the last remnants of the Atlantic Forest remains in and around the Iguazu Falls. This is a subtropical forest with native bamboos and a rich diversity of birds including toucans and hummingbirds. Coatis are accustomed to begging for food from park visitors. Most of the streets of Puerto Iguazu are unmetalled, red dirt, with gutters on either side (canalitos) that have grassy banks in which eels and a variety of freshwater fish, including knifefish (gymnotus) and catfish, inhabit. The canals drain into the Paraná River.\n\n\n"}

The station airs a Top 40 (CHR) radio format and is owned by Alpha Media. It carries the syndicated morning drive time show \"Brooke & Jubal\" from KQMV in Seattle. \n\nKBFF's studios and offices are located in Downtown Portland, on SW Fifth Avenue. The transmitter is in Portland's West Hills, off SW Fairmount Court.\n\nThe 95.5 MHz spot on the FM dial in Portland was first occupied by the original KWJJ-FM. That station signed on in 1946. It was only powered at 3,400 watts and it mostly simulcast AM 1080 KWJJ (now KFXX). But in the 1940s and 50s, few radios could receive FM signals and management saw little opportunity to make it profitable. In the mid 50s, KWJJ silenced the FM station, giving up the license.\n\nThen, on September 23, 1959, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted International Good Music, Inc. (IGM) a construction permit to build a new FM station on 95.5 MHz. In early October 1959, call sign KGMG was granted, standing for \"Good Music,\" the format term for classical music. By September 9, 1960, 95.5 KGMG was testing intermittently.\n\nOn September 25, 1960, at 7 a.m., KGMG began regular operations by airing programming from the IGM automation system. KGMG broadcast from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. daily, and only selected commercials were played and no singing jingles were allowed. By March 1962, KGMG was broadcasting the recorded \"Heritage Concert\" series. On March 17, 1962, KGMG became the second Portland station to broadcast in multiplex stereo. In July 1962, KGMG began leasing antenna space to Pacific Motor Trucking Co. for a 25-watt VHF transmitter.\n\nOn April 20, 1964, KGMG switched to an automated MOR format from IGM. By mid-1964, KGMG was broadcasting 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily.\n\nOn May 13, 1965, the FCC approved the $125,000 sale of KGMG to Seattle, Portland & Spokane Radio, a joint venture of Dena Pictures, Inc. and the Alexander Broadcasting Company. Seattle, Portland & Spokane Radio also owned AM 750 KXL (now KXTG). Two months later, on July 5, 1965, KGMG became KXL-FM and began duplicating KXL's \"Good Music\" format as \"KXL & KXL-FM Stereo\".\n\nIn September 1966, KXL-FM staff began taping the evening \"Good Music\" programming for syndicator IGM, now known as Broadcast Programming International (BPI). The company provided the software to many FM stations nationwide. In 1969, KXL-FM raised its power to 100,000 watts and increased antenna height to 990 feet.\n\nAt the time, KXL (AM) was a daytimer, required to sign off at sunset to avoid interfering with clear channel station WSB in Atlanta, so it simulcasted its programming on KXL-FM, which could continue the programming at night. In 1970, KXL-AM-FM switched to a \"Popular Music\" middle of the road (MOR) format as \"KXL-FM Stereo 95\". Most FM stations by the 1970s could not fully simulcast their AM stations, but this rule didn't apply to AM stations that were daytimers. KXL-FM continued to simulcast KXL (AM) through 1974.\n\nIn March 1984, KXL-FM switched to TM's Beautiful Music service and was playing five to six vocals an hour until 1989, when the station began running Unistar's \"Special Blend\" soft adult contemporary satellite format with local morning host George Walker.\n\nIn April 1990, KXL-FM changed format to \"Lite Favorites,\" a combination of soft AC and soft rock. It was branded as \"K95.5\". This format also utilized a satellite music service except for drive times. \n\nOn September 27, 1993, KXL-FM switched to a Hot AC format as \"Star 95.5\" but only lasted a year.\n\nOn October 18, 1994, KXL-FM switched to all '70s Hits as \"Seventies 95.5\". This format only lasted a year and a half.\n\nOn April 15, 1996, KXL-FM modified its 1970s format to include 1980s music and adopted the branding \"Music Radio 95 KXL\".\n\nIn the Fall of 1996, KXL-FM returned to Hot AC. On April 1, 1997, KXL-FM switched to a new slogan as \"Mix 95.5\". In December 1997, Carl Widing was hired as Program Director and in February 1998, KXL-FM switched to a Triple A format as \"95.5FM\". \n\nOn November 30, 1998, KXL-FM was sold to the Rose City Radio Corp. for $55 Million.\n\nOn March 26, 1999, at 5:30 p.m., KXL-FM switched to a rhythmic contemporary format as \"Jammin' 95.5\", becoming the first FM station in Portland to air the format full time. The first song was \"Changes\" by 2Pac.\n\nOn April 30, 1999, KXL-FM changed the call letters to KXJM.\n\nOn May 1, 2008, due to declining ratings, Rose City Radio announced that KXJM would change formats to all sports on May 12th, as \"95.5 The Game.\" The switch almost left Portland without a hip-hop station, and as a result, would leave Portland listeners with only two choices for rhythmic music: Mainstream Top 40 KKRZ, whose playlist included some hip-hop songs, and KVMX, the market's Rhythmic Adult Contemporary station.\n\nOn May 9, 2008, at 6 p.m., KVMX officially ditched its Rhythmic AC format and became Portland's new home for Rhythmic Contemporary as \"Jammin' 107.5.\" Both KXJM and KVMX simulcasted the format that weekend until KXJM's flip to sports at 9 a.m. the following Monday, May 12th. KVMX also acquired the KXJM call letters, the website and all intellectual properties from Rose City. \n\nOn May 27, 2008, the original KXJM officially chose KXTG as its new call letters to better reflect the sports format and \"The Game\" moniker. KXTG and AM sister station KXL changed ownership would be bought by Alpha Broadcasting in May 2009. Despite the station's emphasis on local hosts, ratings success did not follow, usually peaking at about a 2.0 share in the Arbitron ratings.\n\nOn May 21, 2011, Alpha announced that on May 25th, at 5:00 p.m., KXTG's sports format would be moving to AM 750 KXL, which was running a news/talk format that at the time was simulcasting on 101.1 FM, previously a rock station. 95.5 FM would then launch a new format at the same time, although the announcement didn't say what that new format would be. \n\nThe question of what the format would be began to take on a life of its own when industry website RadioInsight reported that Alpha registered several domain names for the station, in order to keep people guessing. On May 24, 2011, a logo and website for \"Live 95.5\" appeared in a Google cache, with the hint referenced in its moniker as \"Today's Modern Mix,\" indicating a contemporary music format.\n\nOn May 25, at 5 p.m., KXTG flipped to a Hot AC/Adult Top 40 format as \"Live 95-5, Today's Modern Mix For The Modern Woman\". The first song was \"Raise Your Glass\" by P!nk, beginning a 10,000 songs-in-a-row promotion to attract listeners interest. The station also changed its call letters to KBFF.\n\nKBFF saw its ratings improve, going from a 1.9 in its last book as a Sports outlet in May 2011 to a 3.6 share in the June 2011 book, along with a spike in its audience cumes, topping 105.1 The Buzz for the Adult Top 40 crown.\n\nIn September 2012, KBFF shifted to Top 40/CHR. To capitalize on this, the station shortened its slogan to \"Today's Modern Mix,\" and then eventually \"Portland's #1 Hit Music Station.\" \n\nIn August 2014, KBFF dropped its entire on-air lineup and relaunched as \"Live 95-5, The Station That Sounds Like Portland\".\n\nIn April 2015, the station restructured its on-air lineup, adding the syndicated \"Brooke & Jubal\" morning drive time show, based at KQMV in Seattle. \n\nOn October 22, 2018, at 10 a.m., as a Halloween stunt, KBFF began branding itself as “eviL 95-5” (“eviL” is Live spelled backwards) and started airing spooky sounds in between songs. This continued until November 1st at Midnight.\n\n"}
{"id": "2309106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309106", "title": "Henri Sauguet", "text": "Henri Sauguet\n\nHenri Sauguet (18 May 1901 – 22 June 1989), was a French composer. Born in Bordeaux as Henri-Pierre Poupard, he adopted his mother's maiden name as his pseudonym. His output includes operas, ballets, four symphonies (1945, 1949, 1955, 1971), concertos, chamber and choral music and numerous songs, as well as film music. Although he experimented with musique concrète and expanded tonality, he remained opposed to particular systems and his music evolved little: he developed tonal or modal ideas in smooth curves, producing an art of clarity, simplicity and restraint.\n\nSauguet started learning the piano at home when he was five years old. Later he was taught by the organist of the church of Sainte-Eulalie de Bordeaux. On the mobilization of his father in 1914, he was required to earn a living at a very young age. Eventually employed by the Prefecture of Montauban in 1919-1920, he formed a friendship with Joseph Canteloube, a former pupil of Vincent d'Indy. Together they collected and harmonized traditional songs under the title \"Chants d'Auvergne\" (Songs of Auvergne). During this period too he continued his musical education with local organists and himself served as organist at the small church of St-Vincent de Floirac just outside the city (1916–22). Sacred music, and especially organ arrangements, were to influence him for the rest of his life. One may instance the pieces he later wrote for organ and various combinations of instruments: \"Oraisons\", with four saxophones (1976); \"Ne moriatur in aeternum\", with trumpet (1979); \"Church Sonata\", with string quintet (1985).\nWhen Henri Collet dubbed a group of Paris-based composers Les Six, Sauguet started writing to one of its members, Darius Milhaud. He also began to refer to himself and two Bordeaux friends, Louis Emié and Jean-Marcel Lizotte (another composer and a poet-musician), as 'Les Trois'. Their first concert took place on 12 December 1920. This included performances of works by 'Les Six' (Georges Auric, Louis Durey, Arthur Honegger, Germaine Tailleferre, Darius Milhaud and Francis Poulenc), together with \"Erik Satie \"et la jeune musique française\"\". Among compositions by all three local exponents of 'the young French music' were Sauguet's four-handed \"Danse nègre\" and his \"Pastorale pour piano\".\n\nSauguet's correspondence with Milhaud led to the composer asking to see some of his works. He wrote a piano suite called \"Trois Françaises\" (Three Frenchwomen) which so impressed Milhaud that he encouraged the young man to move to Paris. Arriving in October 1921, he found work as a secretary at the Guimet Museum. For some six years he studied composition with Charles Koechlin, whom he credits with helping him understand music within its own context and find his own voice.\n\nIn 1923, together with three other admirers of Satie's music (Henri Clicquot-Pleyell, Roger Désormière, Maxime Jacob), Sauguet formed the 'School of Arcueil', named after the location of Satie's home. With his support, they had their first concert on 25 October 1923 at Théâtre des Champs-Elysées. In 1924 Erik Satie introduced Sauguet to Serge Diaghilev, the flamboyant impresario of the Ballets Russes, and he wrote his first ballet, \"Les Roses\" (Roses) that year. In 1927 Diaghilev's company produced the ballet \"La Chatte\" (The Cat) with music by Sauguet, which premiered in Monte Carlo on April 30. The story is about a young man who falls in love with a cat, which assumes a human form through the intervention of Aphrodite. As they make love, the cat-woman sees a mouse and cannot resist chasing it, whereupon she changes back into a cat. The work was choreographed by the young George Balanchine.\n\nSauguet gained his greatest popularity with his ballets, of which he wrote over twenty. The best of these, and the work by which he is most known outside France, was \"Les Forains\" (1945) about a talented, slightly tattered, but ultimately hopeful travelling circus troupe. He also wrote numerous works for radio, television, stage, and film, and a large quantity of chamber and other instrumental works, including solos for harmonica and musical saw, but his particular talent was vocal music. He worked ten years on \"La chartreuse de Parme\" (The Charterhouse of Parma, 1936) - based on Stendhal's novel - an opera that had a reputation in France as his most important work. Internationally, however, it was considered to be short on emotion and drama. Other operatic works include \"La Contrebasse\" (1930), \"La Gageure Imprévue\" (1942), \"Les Caprices de Marianne\" (1954) and \"Boule de Suif\" (1978).\n\nThe war period brought a change to Sauguet's work, which had previously been marked by his high spirits. He used his reputation during this time to help his Jewish friends but lost the oldest-established among them, Max Jacob, who died in the Drancy internment camp. At the war's end he completed his Symphony No. 1, known as \"Expiatoire\" (Expiatory), in tribute to the war's innocent victims. This was followed by his 2nd Symphony, known as \"The Allegorical\" or \"The Seasons\", in 1949. His 3rd Symphony is known as \"I.N.R.\" and his 4th, a meditation on old age written as he approached the age of seventy, as \"Du Troisième Age\" (\"The Third Age\"). In 1945 he contributed incidental music to the premiere of La Folle de Chaillot, by Jean Giraudoux.\n\nSauguet worked as a music critic throughout the 1930s and 1940s. He founded the Composers Union, also devoting his time to \"Una Voce\", an organization that works to preserve Latin and traditional chant in the Roman Catholic liturgy.\n\nIn 1956 Sauguet was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour and succeeded his friend Milhaud into the French Academy in 1976.\n\nSauguet's personal partnership with the set designer and decorator of French theatre, Jacques Dupont, endured until the latter's death in 1978.\nWhen Sauguet died in Paris in 1989, he was buried at the Montmartre Cemetery in the same grave as Dupont and next to that of André Jolivet in Section 27, near the grave of Hector Berlioz.\n\nSauguet's autobiography \"Musique, ma vie\" (Music, my life) was published posthumously in 1990.\n\n\n"}

Two epigrams by him in the Greek Anthology (\"Anthol. pal.\" xiv. 63, xvi. 323) are extant, and a hymn to Nemesis. The hymn is one of four which preserve the ancient musical notation written over the text. Two other hymns, one to the muse Calliope and one entitled \"Hymn to the Sun\", formerly assigned to Dionysius of Alexandria, have also been attributed to Mesomedes. In an article published in 2003, Annie Bélis proves that the Berlin musical papyrus (inv. 6870) contains a Paean to Apollo written by Mesomedes. A total of 15 poems by Mesomedes are known.\n\nMesomedes continued in the Musaeum in Alexandria even after Hadrian's death (138); there the \"Historia Augusta\" reports that during Antoninus Pius' reign, 138-161 his state salary was reduced. The emperor Caracalla 212-217 honored Mesomedes with a cenotaph approximately a 50–60 years after his death.\n\nPrior to the discovery of the Seikilos epitaph in the late 19th century, the hymns of Mesomedes were the only surviving written music from the ancient world. Three were published by Vincenzo Galilei in his \"Dialogo della musica antica e della moderna\" (Florence, 1581), during a period of intense investigation into music of the ancient Greeks. These hymns had been preserved through the Byzantine tradition, and were presented to Vincenzo by Girolamo Mei.\n\nSee J. F. Bellermann, \"Die Hymnen des Dionysius und Mesomedes\" (1840); C. de Jan, \"Musici scriptores graeci\" (1899); S. Reinach in \"Revue des études grecques\", ix (1896); \"Suidas\", s.v.\n\nThe dialect of this hymn is different from the others (Ionian rather than Doric), and the style is also slightly different; for this reason J.G. Landels believes that it is probably not by Mesomedes.\n\nIn anthologies:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Specifically, it is adjacent to Louisville's wharf and Riverfront Plaza/Belvedere, which are situated to the west of the park.\n\nPhase I of Waterfront Park consists of approximately and was dedicated on July 4, 1999. Louisville architects Bravura Corporation, together with Hargreaves Associates, were the designers of the park. Much of the park, such as the Great Lawn, had opened to the public by the fall of 1998. The initial development cost was about $58 million, a combination of public and private money. The site of the park was previously used for industrial purposes: scrap yards, sand pits and other industrial sites.\n\nThe park hosted hundreds of events in its first full season of use, including outdoor concerts and other festivals, with an estimated total attendance of more than a million people. There were problems early-on with the grass being too easily worn down by visitors.\n\nPhase II of the park opened on June 10, 2004, and added approximately 17 acres (69,000 m²), including the Adventure Playground, which opened in July 2003. Included is an esplanade along the river's edge and a cafe plaza where the Tumbleweed cafe opened in the spring of 2005. The park also contains the Brown-Forman amphitheater, docks for transient boaters, and an area for a new rowing facility. The latter is used for the University of Louisville Women's Rowing Team, school and community rowing groups.\n\nConstruction on part of Phase III began in late spring of 2005, to add 13 acres (53,000 m²) and include the conversion of the former Big Four Railroad bridge going between the park and Jeffersonville, Indiana's waterfront park into a pedestrian bridge. Several more lawn areas, tree groves, walking paths, and picnic areas will also be added. As of May 2007 it was not clear when the long-planned conversion will begin, as funding had not yet been found.\n\nIn 2006, David Karem, executive director of the Waterfront Development Corporation, a public agency that operates Waterfront Park, wished to deter visitors from bathing in the large public fountain. He initiated a plan that was dependent on the average park visitor's \"lack of understanding about water's chemical makeup\", and arranged for signs that read: \"DANGER! – WATER CONTAINS HIGH LEVELS OF HYDROGEN – KEEP OUT\". The signs were posted on the fountain at public expense. As it is true that ordinary water molecules each contain two atoms of hydrogen, and thus posed no danger, it is considered one of many water-related hoaxes.\n\nIn February 2011, Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels announced that the two states, along with the City of Jeffersonville, will allocate $22 million in funding to complete the Big Four Bridge project, creating a pedestrian and bicycle path to link Louisville and Jeffersonville. Indiana will spend up to $8 million and the City of Jeffersonville will provide $2 million in matching dollars to pay for construction of a ramp to the Big Four Bridge. Kentucky is pledging $12 million to replace the deck on the bridge and connect it to the spiral ramp that has been completed in Waterfront Park. The Big Four Bridge is open to pedestrians and cyclists on the Louisville side. The Jeffersonville ramp for The Big Four Bridge, known to locals as the Walking Bridge, was scheduled for August 2013, but was pushed back to November 2013.\n\nIn July 2012, Jeffersonville City officials unveiled plans for a plaza, dubbed the \"Big Four Station\", costing approximately $3 million that will surround the new ramp, to be completed in early 2013, from the Big Four pedestrian bridge. The plaza was to include a covered playground, fountain, stage, pavilion and plenty of green space. The new plaza was expected to be finished by early 2014.\n\nThe bridge was completed in May 2014 with the opening of the Jeffersonville ramp.\n\nIn 2013 the park won the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence a national design award that seeks to identify and honor places that address economic and social concerns in urban design.\n\nAs of the summer of 2005, Waterfront Park offers free wireless Internet access. Currently, this is the largest public park in the nation to offer such access. \n\nThe park is packed each year during Thunder over Louisville, a major fireworks exhibition which occurs on the Ohio right in front of the park.\n\nThe western half of the park features linear fountains, not officially intended for swimming but nevertheless popular for that purpose. Further east are two expansive lawns, bisected by the interstate, and a small series of docks for boats. Nearby are the Children's Play Area and the Adventure Playground. If completed, the pedestrian walkway and ramp will be on the eastern end of the park.\n\nThe park is heavily used on a daily basis, and averages more than 1.5 million visitors per year. It is a popular home to free and pay concerts and festivals, especially in the summer.\n\nWaterfront Park connects to the Riverwalk via the Belvedere, and may eventually be part of an effort to create a long mixed use trail around the entire city of Louisville.\n\nI-64 runs through the park, and portions of the park exist under it. 8664, a grassroots campaign, has aimed to re-route I-64 to enhance Louisville's waterfront. I-64 will be widened over the park as a part of the Ohio River Bridges Project, supported by the Mayor and most involved in city and interstate planning.\n\nIn May 2007 designs for the span over the Great Lawn were released, causing some controversy. The two proposed designs called for either 40 or 58 pillars, at a cost of $48 or $36 million, respectively. The Waterfront Development Corporation favored a $160 million proposal which could have as few as 10 pillars, and an aesthetically pleasing span design. This more expensive proposal was left out of the options presented. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet later apologized for omitting the design and said it could still be considered, but additional funding would have to be found.\n\n"}

It operates scheduled and charter seaplane and land plane service to destinations throughout western Washington and southwestern British Columbia, as well as seaplane \"flightseeing\" flights around Seattle. In addition to its corporate headquarters, seaplane maintenance facility and terminal in Kenmore, the airline has hub operations for seaplanes at its terminal on Seattle's Lake Union and for land planes at Seattle's Boeing Field/King County International Airport. It also operates a maintenance facility for its land plane fleet at Boeing Field.\n\nThe airline was established as Kenmore Air Harbor and started operations on March 21, 1946. It was founded by Robert Munro, Reginald Collins and Jack Mines and began operations with a single Aeronca Model K seaplane and a hangar at a location formerly occupied by a lumber mill on north Lake Washington. The airline is still at its original location. After a short term partnership Munro continued alone with the company until his death in October 2000.\n\nThe company was originally named Mines Collins Munro but was changed to the current name Kenmore Air a few months later to reflect its ties to the town of Kenmore, Washington where its operations were located both then and now. After beginning operations with its Aeronca Model K, it purchased three more aircraft a few weeks later.\n\nKenmore Air originally made its money by accessing remote and sometimes dangerous locations during its early years. In July 1946, pilot Jack Mines was killed while flying supplies to a search and rescue team in the nearby Cascade mountains; as a result, Collins and Munro became the two owners of Kenmore Air. Munro soon became the sole owner of Kenmore Air when Collins moved to California after accepting a job there.\n\nFrom the start, Kenmore Air's seaplane maintenance and restoration service was an important part of the company. In the late-1940s, Kenmore Air became a Republic Seabee dealer for the Northwest and this became a success for Kenmore Air. At one point, 40 Seabees were based at Kenmore Air Harbor, though Kenmore Air themselves owned just one of these amphibian aircraft. Kenmore became experts in maintenance and repair of the aircraft and developed several modifications to improve the aircraft's performance. Kenmore Air also became an official aircraft and parts dealer for Cessna by the end of the 1950s, further expanding its aircraft maintenance business.\n\nIn the 1950s, Kenmore Air began its charter business by offering flights to fishing and hunting spots in the Pacific Northwest. Kenmore Air also leased an aircraft to the US government for survey flights in Alaska. This led to a series of contracts with the US Navy which continues today. In 1953, a Canadian mining company hired Kenmore to help fly in equipment and tools to build a mining camp on Leduc Glacier, fifty miles north of Ketchikan, Alaska. Kenmore Air used two Noorduyn Norseman and a Seabed to fly in equipment over a two-month period. The aircraft flew in several pieces of large equipment to the glacier, including diesel engines, railroad cars, and tractors.\n\nIn the 1960s, Kenmore Air expanded its maintenance services to include the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver seaplane. They purchased their first Beaver in 1963 and the Beaver soon became a centerpiece of Kenmore Air's fleet, and they created a rebuilding and modification program around the seven-passenger aircraft. After the Beaver ceased production in 1967, Kenmore Air began to establish themselves as a leading refurbisher of the seaplane. They modified and rebuilt Beavers to such an extent that such aircraft modified by the company have become known as \"Kenmore Beavers\" by the global aviation community. Kenmore Air has rebuilt a total of 125 Beavers since then. To accommodate their expansion, the company built a new hangar and office building during the 1960s.\n\nIn the early 1970s, in a contract with the US Navy, Kenmore Air transported unarmed torpedoes to a joint US-Canadian testing facility near Vancouver Island. For five years during this decade, Kenmore Air transported scientists and supplies for the U.S. Geological Survey to a glacier in the North Cascade Mountains, South Cascade Glacier, in which the seaplanes had to takeoff and land on a glacier 6,500 feet above sea level. The airline also expanded its charter service in the 1970s, offering round-trip flights to fishing resorts in British Columbia.\n\nIn the mid-1980s Kenmore Air purchased Otter Air, an airline that offered seaplane service from Seattle to Victoria, BC. The Seattle-Victoria route was operated for two years before it was sold to their competitor Lake Union Air in 1988. Kenmore Air also added two Turbo Beavers (a modified Beaver with its radial engine replaced with a turboprop engine) in the late 1980s, and purchased their main competitor Lake Union Air in 1992. With this purchase, Kenmore Air acquired a seaplane terminal on Lake Union. They converted one of Lake Union Air's de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters into a Turbo Otter and later purchased several more Turbo Otters.\n\nKenmore Air acquired Lake Union Air Service in 1993; in 1997 planned to begin operating service from Elliott Bay, a body of water on Puget Sound where Seattle's downtown waterfront is located. In 1998, Kenmore Air gained a federal permit allowing them to begin operations there, pending approval from Seattle's city council. The company later abandoned their plans in fall 1999 after encountering resistance from members of the local community.\n\nIn October 2000, Robert Munro, the company's founder and owner, died at age 83 after an extended illness. Ownership was passed to Munro's son, Gregg Munro, while several other family members, also held management positions at Kenmore Air.\n\nResidents in both Seattle near their Lake Union seaport and in Victoria have been growing increasingly concerned about noise and safety on the water. In Sept 2011 Victoria the St. James Community commissioned a report that calls for \"serious restrictions\" on seaplane businesses\" (which include other services like helicopters).

{"id": "2309174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309174", "title": "All Things Must Pass (song)", "text": "All Things Must Pass (song)\n\n\"All Things Must Pass\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, issued in November 1970 as the title track to his triple album of the same name. Billy Preston released the song originally – as \"All Things (Must) Pass\" – on his Apple Records album \"Encouraging Words\" (1970), after the Beatles had rejected it for inclusion on their \"Let It Be\" album in January 1969. The composition reflects the influence of the Band's sound and communal music-making on Harrison, after he had spent time with the group in Woodstock, New York, in late 1968, while Timothy Leary's poem \"All Things Pass\", a psychedelic adaptation of the \"Tao Te Ching\", provided inspiration for his song lyrics.\n\nThe subject matter deals with the transient nature of human existence, and in Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass\" reading, words and music combine to reflect impressions of optimism against fatalism. On release, together with Barry Feinstein's album cover image, commentators viewed the song as a statement on the Beatles' break-up. Widely regarded as one of Harrison's finest compositions, its rejection by his former band has provoked comment from biographers and reviewers. Music critic Ian MacDonald described \"All Things Must Pass\" as \"the wisest song never recorded by The Beatles\", while author Simon Leng considers it \"perhaps the greatest solo Beatle composition\". The recording was co-produced by Phil Spector in London; it features an orchestral arrangement by John Barham and contributions from musicians such as Ringo Starr, Pete Drake, Bobby Whitlock, Eric Clapton and Klaus Voormann.\n\nAlthough the Beatles failed to formally record the song, a 1969 solo demo by Harrison appears on their compilation \"Anthology 3\" (1996). An early version from the \"All Things Must Pass\" sessions was released on Harrison's posthumous compilation \"\" in 2012. Paul McCartney performed \"All Things Must Pass\" at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death. Jim James, the Waterboys, Klaus Voormann and Yusuf Islam, and Sloan Wainwright are among the other artists who have covered the song.\n\nLike his friend Eric Clapton, George Harrison was inspired by \"Music from Big Pink\", the seminal debut album from the Band, the former backing group for Bob Dylan. Released in July 1968, \"Music from Big Pink\" was partly responsible for Harrison's return to the guitar, his first instrument, after he had spent two years attempting to master the more complex Indian sitar. Harrison duly shared his enthusiasm with the British music press, declaring \"Big Pink\" \"\"the\" new sound to come from America\", drummer Levon Helm later recalled, thus helping to establish the Band internationally. In appreciation, Robbie Robertson, the Band's guitarist, extended an invitation to Harrison to stop by in Woodstock, New York, when the opportunity arose.\nLate in 1968, after producing sessions in Los Angeles for a solo album by Apple Records signing Jackie Lomax, Harrison spent Thanksgiving and much of December in upstate New York, where he renewed his friendship with a now semi-retired Dylan and took part in informal jam sessions with the Band. According to Helm, they discussed making a possible \"fireside jam\" album with Clapton and an Apple Films \"rock western\" called \"Zachariah\", but neither project progressed beyond the planning stage. The bucolic surroundings proved fruitful for Harrison as a songwriter, producing his first collaboration with Dylan, \"I'd Have You Anytime\", and leading him to write \"All Things Must Pass\". He later described the latter song as a \"Robbie Robertson–Band type of tune\", and said that he always imagined it being sung by Helm.\n\nWhile discussing \"All Things Must Pass\" with music journalist Timothy White in 1987, Harrison recalled that his \"starting point\" for the composition was Robertson's \"The Weight\" – a song that had \"a religious \"and\" a country feeling to it\".<ref name=\"White/Musician\">Timothy White, \"George Harrison – Reconsidered\", \"Musician\", November 1987, p. 62.</ref> Musically, the verses of \"All Things Must Pass\" are set to a logical climb within the key of E; the brief choruses form a departure from this, with their inclusion of a B minor chord rather than the more expected major voicing. Author Ian Inglis notes that the composition incorporates the same \"modes, cadences and suspensions\" found in Band songs such as \"The Weight\" and \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\".\nFor his lyrics, Harrison drew inspiration from \"All Things Pass\", a poem published in Timothy Leary's 1966 book \"Psychedelic Prayers after the Tao Te Ching\". In his 1980 autobiography, \"I Me Mine\", Harrison refers to the idea for the song originating from \"all kinds of mystics and ex-mystics\", including Leary. Like later Harrison compositions such as \"Here Comes the Sun\", \"So Sad\" and \"Blow Away\", the lyrical and emotional content is based around metaphors involving the weather and the cycle of nature. Harrison states in the opening lines of verse one: \"Sunrise doesn't last all morning / A cloudburst doesn't last all day\".\n\nAccording to Harrison biographer Simon Leng, the lyrics reflect \"life's ephemeral character\" and the \"transitory\" nature of love. Inglis suggests that the song is \"[o]stensibly\" about \"the end of a love affair\". He and theologian Dale Allison note the optimism offered in Harrison's words, since, as Leng puts it, \"a new day always dawns.\" Although \"All Things Must Pass\" avoids religiosity, Allison writes that its statement on the \"all-inclusive\" transience of things in the material world explains why so much of its 1970 parent album, \"All Things Must Pass\", \"finds hope and meaning only in God, who does not pass away\". The song's main message is offered in its middle eight:\n\nUltimately, the cycle of nature offers \"consolation\", Leng writes, as further evidenced in the verse-three lines \"Now the darkness only stays at night time\" and \"Daylight is good at arriving at the right time\".\n\nThe lyrics underwent some minor changes after Harrison presented the song to the Beatles in January 1969, when they began working at London's Twickenham Film Studios for the so-called \"Get Back\" project (released as the \"Let It Be\" album and film). He had initially written the second line of verse two as the more literal \"A wind can blow those clouds away\", but bootlegs from the sessions reveal John Lennon suggesting the word \"mind\" to introduce a bit of \"psychedelia\" into the song. Similarly, the repeated line \"it's not always gonna be this grey\" was originally \"It's not always been this grey\" in verses one and two.\n\nIn contrast with the creative equality he enjoyed with Dylan and the Band in Woodstock, Harrison returned to the Beatles fold and found the same discordant atmosphere that had blighted the White Album sessions in 1968. Early on during the \"Get Back\" rehearsals – and tellingly, music journalist John Harris notes, before the arrival that day of Lennon and his partner Yoko Ono – Harrison enthused with fellow Beatles Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney about the Band's camaraderie and group ethos, saying: \"They're just living, and they happen to be a band as well.\"<ref name=\"Harris/Woods p 92\">John Harris, \"Into the Woods\", \"Mojo\", December 2003, p. 92.</ref>\n\nOn 2 January, day one of the Twickenham film shoot, Harrison introduced \"All Things Must Pass\", and the band worked on the song intermittently over the next four days of filming. In the search for a suitable musical arrangement, Harrison stressed his preference for a \"feel\" akin to the Band, a suggestion that resulted in Lennon switching from guitar to Lowrey organ, a keyboard favoured by the Band's Garth Hudson. During the Twickenham rehearsals, the Beatles also discussed the idea of Harrison performing \"All Things Must Pass\" solo for inclusion in the proposed film.\n\nThey returned to the song briefly towards the end of January, by which time the project had moved location to their own Apple Studio, in central London – one of Harrison's conditions for rejoining the Beatles after his temporary walkout on 10 January. Although the band gave a fair amount of time to \"All Things Must Pass\", it was ultimately put aside, just as other Harrison compositions including \"Old Brown Shoe\", \"Isn't It a Pity\", \"Let It Down\" and \"I Me Mine\" received a lukewarm reception, particularly from Lennon. David Fricke of \"Rolling Stone\" has referred to this period as a \"struggle\" for Harrison \"against the patronizing restrictions of writing within and for the Beatles\". Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt, authors of \"Get Back: The Unauthorized Chronicle of The Beatles' Let It Be Disaster\", observe that Lennon and McCartney routinely rejected Harrison's songs, \"even though some were far better than their own\".\n\nThe Beatles never formally recorded \"All Things Must Pass\", and only rehearsal takes circulate on bootleg compilations from the sessions. The \"Fly on the Wall\" bonus disc accompanying the McCartney-instigated \"Let It Be... Naked\" album (2003) includes a snippet of the Beatles indulging in some Band-like chorusing on the song.\n\nDuring the Beatles' Apple Studio session on 28 January, Harrison talked with Lennon and Ono about possibly doing a solo album of his unused songs, in order to \"preserve this, the Beatle bit, more\". Lennon offered his support for the idea. While author Bruce Spizer has suggested that Lennon was keen to \"spare\" the band from having to work on Harrison's songs, Sulpy and Schweighardt consider that Lennon's enthusiasm was because such a solo project would allow him and Ono to continue their own recording activities \"without causing friction within The Beatles\".\n\nOn 25 February 1969, his 26th birthday, Harrison entered Abbey Road Studios alone and recorded a demo of the song, along with other recent compositions \"Old Brown Shoe\" and \"Something\". With Ken Scott serving as engineer, he recorded two takes of \"All Things Must Pass\", adding extra electric guitar onto the second. This version was eventually released in 1996 on the Beatles' outtake collection \"Anthology 3\".\n\nSoon after Harrison had begun talking publicly about making a solo album, during the final months of 1969, he offered \"All Things Must Pass\", along with the more recent \"My Sweet Lord\", to Billy Preston for the latter's album \"Encouraging Words\". Through Harrison's invitation, Preston had played keyboards for the Beatles once the \"Get Back/Let It Be\" sessions resumed at Apple Studio, where the 22-year-old Texan had impressed with his superior musicianship and convivial presence. Preston was soon offered a recording deal with Apple Records, \"Encouraging Words\" being the second album under the contract.\n\nCo-produced by Harrison, Preston's reading of \"All Things Must Pass\" betrays an obvious debt to his former mentor, Ray Charles. While Harrison's later recording is generally viewed as the definitive version, Bruce Eder of AllMusic considers this treatment of the song the superior of the two. Preston's version appeared in September 1970, five months after the Beatles' break-up.\n\nWhile completing his production on Preston's release, Harrison chose to record the song himself for what became the title track of his post-Beatles solo debut, the triple album \"All Things Must Pass\". In describing \"All Things Must Pass\" as a \"haunting hymn about the mortality of everything\", author Elliot Huntley notes the added poignance in Harrison's version, due to the death of his mother in July 1970 after a long period of illness.\n\nWith Phil Spector as his co-producer, Harrison taped the basic track at Abbey Road Studios between 26 May and early in June. Other participants included Clapton, German bassist Klaus Voormann and Starr, the latter another avowed Band fan. Leng credits the song's piano part to Bobby Whitlock, who also sang backing vocals with Clapton, his future bandmate in Derek and the Dominos. In his 2010 autobiography, Whitlock states that it was Preston who played the piano on \"All Things Must Pass\", while his own contribution was pump organ, or harmonium. Although Leng lists both Harrison and Clapton as having played acoustic guitar and Starr and Jim Gordon on drums, according to the personnel that Whitlock offers, neither Clapton nor Gordon played on the song. Among the overdubs on the track, Nashville session musician Pete Drake recorded a pedal-steel guitar part during a brief visit to London, to participate in sessions for Harrison songs such as \"Behind That Locked Door\" and \"I Live for You\".\nSpector's erratic behaviour during the \"All Things Must Pass\" sessions left Harrison to handle most of the project alone,<ref name=\"Bergstrom/PM\">John Bergstrom, \"George Harrison: All Things Must Pass\", PopMatters, 14 January 2011 (retrieved 28 January 2015).</ref> but in August 1970, after receiving a tape of Harrison's early mixes of the songs, Spector provided him with written feedback and guidance. Spector wrote of \"All Things Must Pass\", \"This particular song is so good that any honest [vocal] performance by you is acceptable as far as I'm concerned\", but he expressed his disapproval of the horns at the start of the track. In the words of authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, \"clearer heads prevailed\" and Jim Price and Bobby Keys' horn parts were retained.\n\nThe recording opens with \"unvaryingly steady\" piano chords, Inglis writes, and what Leng terms \"sensitive\" string orchestration from John Barham, soon joined by the horns and Drake's pedal steel. Leng highlights this combination as providing the song with its rising and falling musical moods, implying variously light and darkness; Inglis writes of the musical arrangement mirroring the \"competing impressions\" of hope and melancholy found in Harrison's lyrics. True to its Catskill roots, the recording evokes the Band's \"The Weight\" and their eponymous second album, the tracks on which were similarly inspired by \"the beauty of that autumn in Woodstock\", according to Helm.\n\nAlmost two years after Harrison wrote the song, \"All Things Must Pass\" was released in November 1970, closing side three of the triple album in its original LP format. Despite its high retail price, \"All Things Must Pass\" was a major commercial success, comfortably outselling concurrent solo releases by Lennon and McCartney.\n\nThe song's title was invariably seen as a statement on the demise of the Beatles, as commentators viewed the album as Harrison's liberation from the artistic constraints imposed on him within the band. The album's cover image, showing Harrison seated on his Friar Park lawn surrounded by four reclining garden gnomes – thought to represent the Beatles – was also viewed as reflecting this theme. While commenting that \"All Things Must Pass\" had \"accrue[d] new layers of relevance\" during the album's creation, particularly with the death of Harrison's mother, former \"Mojo\" editor Paul Du Noyer writes: \"Nobody in November 1970 could have mistaken the title's significance ... As if to cement the association of ideas, the wry cover picture has George in solitary splendour, surrounded by a quartet of gnomes.\" In a 2001 interview, photographer Barry Feinstein admitted that the words \"All Things Must Pass\" had helped inspire his set-up for the photo, saying: \"What else could it be? ... [It] was over with The Beatles, right? And that title ... Very symbolic.\"\n\nOn release, Ben Gerson of \"Rolling Stone\" described \"All Things Must Pass\" as \"eloquently hopeful and resigned\" while labelling the album \"the music of mountain tops and vast horizons\".<ref name=\"Gerson/RS\">Ben Gerson, \"George Harrison \"All Things Must Pass\"\", \"Rolling Stone\", 21 January 1971 (retrieved 3 July 2012).</ref> \"Beatles Forever\" author Nicholas Schaffner noted in 1977, with reference to Harrison's commercial and critical dominance over his former bandmates following the break-up: \"The very fact that the Beatles had kept George's flowering talents so under wraps proved to be his secret weapon.\" Schaffner named \"All Things Must Pass\" and \"Beware of Darkness\" as the two \"most eloquent\" songs on \"All Things Must Pass\", \"musically as well as lyrically\", with \"mysterious, seductive melodies, over which faded strings and horns hover like Blue Jay Way fog\".\n\nWriting for \"Rolling Stone\" in 2000, Anthony DeCurtis praised the song for its musical demonstration of \"the sweet satisfactions of faith\".<ref name=\"DeCurtis/RS\">Anthony DeCurtis, , \"Rolling Stone\", 12 October 2000 (retrieved 28 April 2012).</ref> On a triple album where \"nearly every song is excellent\", AllMusic picks \"All Things Must Pass\" as one of five standout tracks (or AMG track picks), with Richie Unterberger writing of its autumnal theme: \"It's the kind of song that fits the mood in November, when the trees are getting stripped bare of their leaves, the days are getting shorter and colder, and you have to resign yourself to knowing it's going to be tougher and tougher in those regards for months, also knowing that those hardships will pass away come springtime.\"<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\">Richie Unterberger, \"George Harrison 'All Things Must Pass'\", AllMusic (retrieved 17 February 2015).</ref> In his book on Harrison, subtitled \"A Spiritual Biography\", Gary Tillery refers to the song as \"magisterial\" and a \"majestic title track\" that \"leaves even the shallowest listener contemplative\". Michael Gallucci of Ultimate Classic Rock places \"All Things Must Pass\" third on his list of Harrison's best solo songs (behind the two hit singles from \"All Things Must Pass\", \"My Sweet Lord\" and \"What Is Life\"), and comments: \"The album's title track takes on more poignancy after Harrison's death [in 2001], but it's always been great.\"<ref name=\"Gallucci/UCR\">Michael Gallucci, \"Top 10 George Harrison Songs\", Ultimate Classic Rock (retrieved 28 March 2014).</ref> Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham similarly describes the song as \"a heart-rending piece of significant prescience which seems to take on more poignancy with every passing year\".\n\nAmong Harrison's biographers, Simon Leng considers \"All Things Must Pass\" a \"classic of Harrison's lyrical ambiguity, in essence a hopeful song, without sounding so\", with a lyric that \"approaches Bob Dylan standard\". Ian Inglis also praises the lyrics, writing: \"The song contains some of Harrison's most insightful and pensive words. 'Daylight is good at arriving at the right time' is a fine example of his ... ability to position the profound within the commonplace.\" Elliot Huntley rates it as one of Harrison's \"most beautiful\" songs, \"if not \"the\" very best\", and suggests that the sentiments behind \"All Things Must Pass\" would have made it a \"fitting conclusion\" to the final album recorded by the Beatles, \"Abbey Road\" (1969).\n\nBruce Spizer similarly rates \"All Things Must Pass\" a highlight of Harrison's career, while Leng considers it \"perhaps the greatest solo Beatle composition\" of all. In his book \"\", Ian MacDonald describes \"All Things Must Pass\" as \"the wisest song never recorded by The Beatles\". In 2009, \"The Guardian\" included the track in its list of \"1000 Songs Everyone Must Hear\".\n\n\"All Things Must Pass\" was not a track that Harrison ever played in concert, although it appeared on his preliminary setlist for the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh shows. He twice performed the song live in front of TV cameras during the final years of his life, beginning with his appearance with Ravi Shankar on VH1's \"Hard Rock Live\", filmed in New York on 14 May 1997. The pair were on the show to promote their recent collaboration, \"Chants of India\", but at host John Fugelsang's urging, Harrison accepted an acoustic guitar and performed a brief rendition of \"All Things Must Pass\". In late 2000, Harrison sang \"All Things Must Pass\" while again seated on a stool on Friar Park's main lawn, a performance that was included in the press kit for \"All Things Must Pass\"s 30th anniversary reissue early the following year.\n\nCoinciding with this 2001 reissue, the song appeared on a promotional single as the B-side to \"My Sweet Lord (2000)\". After being omitted from the \"cursory\" selection of 1970–75 tracks on \"The Best of George Harrison\" (1976), Inglis writes, the song appeared on Harrison's 2009 career-spanning compilation \"\".\n\nIn Martin Scorsese's 2011 documentary \"\", \"All Things Must Pass\" is the first song featured in the movie, played over footage of German air raids over Britain during World War II. In November that year, a 1970-recorded demo of the song (featuring just Harrison, Starr and Voormann) appeared on the accompanying the British DVD release of the film; this CD was subsequently issued worldwide in May 2012 as \"\".<ref name=\"Early Takes/AMG\">Stephen Thomas Erlewine, \"George Harrison: \"Early Takes, Vol. 1\"\", AllMusic (retrieved 15 September 2012).</ref>\n\nSteve Wood and Daniel May composed music to the 1998 documentary film \"Everest\" incorporating melodies from some of George Harrison's songs, one of which was \"All Things Must Pass\".\n\nAt the Concert for George tribute to Harrison, held at London's Royal Albert Hall on 29 November 2002, Paul McCartney sang \"All Things Must Pass\", backed by a large band that included Preston, Clapton, Voormann and Starr. Leng notes the irony in McCartney performing the song, while Beatles biographer Peter Doggett comments: \"it wasn't hard to imagine Harrison's cynicism as McCartney led the band into a soulful rendition of 'All Things Must Pass' – one of the songs that the other Beatles had refused to take seriously in January 1969.\" According to Clapton, author Robert Rodriguez writes, McCartney \"was humbled at having to relearn it\".\n\nSeveral other artists have recorded \"All Things Must Pass\" in the years since Harrison's death. In 2003, Bobby Whitlock and his wife, CoCo Carmel, included the song on their acoustic live album \"Other Assorted Love Songs, Live from Whitney Chapel\".<ref name=\"Eder/AM\">Bruce Eder, \"Bobby Whitlock & Kim Carmel \"Other Assorted Love Songs\"\", AllMusic (retrieved 30 September 2013).</ref> Jazz guitarist Joel Harrison covered \"All Things Must Pass\" on his album \"Harrison on Harrison: Jazz Explanations of George Harrison\", released in October 2005. In 2007, a live version by the Waterboys appeared on their CD single \"Everybody Takes a Tumble\", and the following year Sloan Wainwright included a cover of the song on her album \"Rediscovery\".\n\n\"All Things Must Pass\" was among the Harrison compositions covered by Jim James on his \"Tribute To\" EP, recorded in December 2001 but not released until August 2009. Also in 2009, Klaus Voormann released a version of the song on his solo album \"A Sideman's Journey\", with Yusuf Islam on vocals and acoustic guitar.\n\nThe musicians who performed on Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass\" version of the song are believed to be as follows:\n\n"}

It is part of the \"Ortsbezirk Innenstadt I\". Its western part forms part of Frankfurt's central business district, the Bankenviertel. Germany's most expensive shopping streets and real estate are found within the city district.\n\nThe Innenstadt stretches in the north and east round the district of Altstadt. Other adjacent districts to the west are Bahnhofsviertel, in the north west the Westend, Nordend to the north and Ostend to the east. In the south, the Innenstadt is bordered naturally by the Main on the opposite bank of which stands the Applewine quarter known as Sachsenhausen.\n\nThe Innenstadt and Altstadt were formed within the borders made up of the \"Anlagen\" (stretches of grassy park land) lying to the right of the Main and are thereby clearly recognisable on the city plan.\n\nThe enclosures of park land of a contrast to the skyscrapers and the banking quarter. The Zeil, Frankfurt's most famous street, as well as the central squares Hauptwache and Konstablerwache, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the Alte Oper, can be found in the Innenstadt. On the Freßgass the bankers and office workers from the nearby office blocks often have lunch.\n\nThe Innenstadt is divided, from west to east, in into the following parts:\n\nThe Altstadt is the historical old town district of Frankfurt. It was devastated in World War II, but parts of it are reconstructed, most recently at the Dom-Römer Project.\n\nThe Bankenviertel (banking district) lies on both sides of the Taunusanlage and is shared between the boroughs of the Innenstadt, Bahnhofsviertel and the Westend. Most credit institutes in the eastern banking quarter are situated in Neue Mainzer Straße, Große Gallusstraße, Junghofstraße and the surrounding streets. All these streets are locations for skyscrapers, whose highest is the 259 metre Commerzbank Tower.\n\nThe southern part of the quarter shows a greater range of use, especially along Kaiserstraße and at Kaiserplatz. The Frankfurter Hof, one of the best known hotels in the city, is located here. In Großer Hirschgraben, the border with the Altstadt, lies one of the cultural highlights of the city, the Goethe House.\n\nThe main axis of the north western part of the Innenstadt (opera quarter) is Große Bockenheimer Straße, running from Rathenauplatz to Opernplatz, as a result of the many places to eat better known as the Freßgass. The southern Goethestraße which runs parallel to the Freßgass is the most expensive shopping street in the city. To the north Kaiserhofstraße, another expensive street, borders Freßgass. The Opernplatz which lies within the parks of the old city walls is considered to be one of the most beautiful squares in the city. The Frankfurt Stock Exchange lies in the shopping street called Schillerstraße.\n\nThe successive squares Rathenauplatz, Goetheplatz and Roßmarkt form the intersection to the neighbouring quarters around the Zeil.\n\nThe streets around the Freßgass are one of the focus points of Frankfurt's nightlife. In Kleine Bockenheimer Straße is the Jazzkeller (jazz cellar), an important cultural institution offering live jazz with local and internationally renowned musicians.\n\nThe pedestrian zone of the Zeil and its end points of Hauptwache and Konstablerwache are the central point for shopping in the city. Between the large department stores are shopping centres like the Zeilgalerie (now demolished and being replaced) and MyZeil. Other important streets begin at Hauptwache such as the Roßmarkt, Steinweg, Schillerstraße and Große Eschenheimer Straße. In the latter of these the Palais Thurn und Taxis used to stand, which has now been reconstructed, as well as important buildings from the post-war years like the \"Fernmeldehochhaus\" and the \"Rundschau-Haus\". At its north end stands the Eschenheimer Turm, a relict of the city fortifications of the late Middle Ages. The Katharinenkirche, the main Protestant church of Frankfurt, stands at Hauptwache; on Bleichstraße the , with its preserved cemetery, is the only green space in the district. The area between Konstablerwache and Alte Gasse is the centre of the gay and lesbian community of Frankfurt.\n\nThe north eastern Innenstadt (courts quarter) is bordered by the eastern half of the Zeil, Konrad-Adenauer-Straße and the Friedberger Anlage. The law courts and its numerous buildings, including the higher regional court, the regional court, and an institute for remand can be found around this area in Heiligkreuzgasse. Several vocational colleges can be found in a noteworthy 1950s multi-story building on Seilerstraße.\n\nThe courts are supposed to be moved to new buildings on Adickesallee in Nordend in the forthcoming years, the character of the courts quarter would therefore completely change and new uses would be found for the area.\n\nIn Heiligkreuzgasse lies Frankfurts well known variety show, the Tigerpalast. The Odeon on the Anlagenring at Seilerstraße is a classic exhibition pavilion which was built for Simon Moritz von Bethmann. Nowadays this is used as a disco.\n\nThe small quarter (All Saints quarter) between the Zeil and Battonnstraße forms a multicultural island in a city otherwise dedicated to commerce. The Breite Gasse forms a second red light district after that of the Bahnhofsviertel. The city library is located close to the Zeil and on Lange Straße there are several city council departments. With the reconstruction of the newly laid Kurt-Schumacher-Straße these council offices overlap the Frankfurter Judengasse, a Jewish Ghetto.\n\nThe south eastern quarter of the Innenstadt was first built-up in the early 19th century, after the previous boggy area was drained out. The Börneplatz synagogue was located at Börneplatz up until the destruction of the synagogue during the Kristallnacht programme in 1938 and it was a centre of Jewish life in Frankfurt. The Jewish cemetery in Battonnstraße is one of the oldest in Europe. Besides this the central offices for public services and the local labour office can be found in the Fischerfeldviertel.\n\nToday's Innenstadt was located outside the town walls until the 14th century. Other than the exposed parks the area was already built-up. Thus a row of houses developed from a cattle market to the north of the walled in town and this market lent its name to the new street: the Zeil. Highways ran to the east and west of that through the town gates into adjacent areas, such as the homes of Bockenheim and the Bockenheimer fort, in which there were already houses and gardens.\n\nThe establishment of the Neustadt began in the year 1333, when Emperor Ludwig der Bayer of the free realm approved of an expansion which would provide three times the previous area to the town. In the time soon after, the town erected new fortifications with five towers: The Gallustor (also Mainzer or Galgentor) on the site of the modern day Willy-Brandt-Platz, the Bockenheimer Tor on the site of the current Opernplatz, the Eschenheimer Tor, the Friedberger Tor and the Allerheiligentor. In the course of the following years the town's new area was filled with streets and buildings, whereby above all rich cloth dealers used the opportunity to establish representative domiciles for themselves outside the narrow old parts of the town. The Eschenheimer Turm, the most glorious tower of the new fortifications, was finished in 1428.\nThe first churches in Neustadt were two small chapels near Bockenheimer gate: the Heiligkreuz chapel of a poor hospital in 1346 as well as the neighbouring Kloster chapel of the Holy Katharina and Barbara in 1354. From the latter the larger seventeenth century Katharinenkirche developed. In the north of the Neustadt the Peterskirche was constructed in 1381, which has been the parochial church of the Neustadt since 1453. Aside from this a cemetery was laid out in this location in 1452, which became the only cemetery on the right side of the main after the closure of the cathedral in 1508. Until the opening of today's main cemetery in 1828 the Peterskirchhof (which was extended several times in the years between) remained the most important cemetery in the town. In 1453 another church was built in the Neustadt, the Maternkapelle at Roßmarkt.\n\nIn the 15th century there were still numerous areas of undeveloped land and many gardens in the Neustadt. The Altstadt was, at this time, still the preferred quarter of the city, and the Neustadt was settled mainly by immigrants flowing from the country into the increasing city. In the 16th century the old city ditch (which was the last deer ditch in 1584) between Altstadt and Neustadt was filled in.\n\nIn the following era gradually the weight of the city shifted between the old and the new town, the new town houses of rich citizens were now built in the Neustadt. These served as accommodation for the royal delegations of emperors who held their coronations in the city. The best known city palace was the Palais Thurn und Taxis of 1737 in Große Eschenheimer Straße. A few years prior to this in 1730 the still preserved police headquarters were built in the heart of the Neustadt. On the Zeil, in particular, a number of representative community centres and the palace of Barckhausen developed in the 18th century. The palace was used for three years as an imperial residence due to Wittelsbacher Karl VII's war with Austria preventing him from moving back into his Munich residence.\n\nIn the active developmental period of the classic era, the best known house of the time is the Goethe House in the Großer Hirschgraben of the Neustadt. In 1755 an urban horse stable was set up at Roßmarkt. In 1782 the Komödienhaus (comedy house), the first definite sign of the future of theatres in Frankfurt, was built on today's Rathenauplatz. Land development of the Fischerfeld in the southeast of the new city began in 1792 from the plans of the architect general, Johann George Christian Hess. The most important of the buildings developed there was municipal library on the bank of the Main, sketched by Hess, which opened in 1825.\n\nIn 1804, during continuing occupation by French troops in the Coalition Wars, the city council decided upon the removal and replacement of the city walls. In the course of the following years a barrier of plants was put in place which is still there as the Anlagen (parks) of today. The plants were placed under the protection of a decree in 1807 which prevented further land development on the now natural barrier.\n\nThe Neustadt became the scene of revolutionary events in 1833: particularly the watch towers at Hauptwache and Konstablerwache. The national assembly in Frankfurt met in 1848/9 in the Paulskirche, the largest and most modern hall of the city located in the Altstadt. However, the different political and parliamentary groups met in accommodation and cafés throughout the Neustadt.\n\nA monument to Goethe was erected at Roßmarkt in 1844, which was moved to the Gallusanlage where it has stood since 1952. 1858 saw the erection of a monument for Johannes Gutenberg which was also placed in Roßmarkt, and another for Friedrich Schiller in 1864 which initially stood at Hauptwache but was moved to Goetheplatz in 1878 and then to the Taunusanlage in 1955. It was late in the city's history before it decided on the construction of a monument to Bismarck, which was set up in the Gallusanlage but later melted down in 1940. The citizens of Frankfurt established a venue in Junghofstraße as a festival and concert hall in 1859. The new main synagogue was inaugurated in Börnerstraße in 1860, and in 1882 another synagogue followed at Börneplatz.\n\nAfter the Austro-Prussian War, Frankfurt quickly developed into one of the more modern cities of Germany. Until that point the wide, meshed road system of the Neustadt had been consolidated by tearing down houses and other areas to allow for splendorous boulevards. After 1870, Kaiserstraße and Kaiserplatz became the main connection between Hauptwache and the western train stations. In 1876, the hotel Frankfurt Hof opened on Kaiserplatz, from which point on it was known as the \"First House on the Square\". After further demolition the new Zeil, Schillerstrasse and Goethestrasse were laid. The extension of the Neue Mainzer Straße was finished in 1874 with a bridge named Untermainbrücke. The newly built home of the stock exchange was opened in 1879 close to Hauptwache. The opera house was established and inaugurated in 1880 following the donations of Frankfurt's citizens. The new law courts were opened in Heiligkreuzstrasse in 1889 and followed by the theatre in Untermainanlage in 1902.\n\nThe rapid process of growth in the new city led to the formation of a town centre. The previous residential districts developed into a commercial and business centre and the residents were soon ejected from the area.\n\nThe trams were changed to electrical operation from 1899, whereby the city had a modern and efficient traffic service. The central traffic node of the trams was situated at Hauptwache, numerous lines lead through the Zeil, which developed into a road of large department stores.\n\nIn the years after the first world war the emphasis of the development concerning town construction shifted more towards the outside quarters. The medieval parts of the city centre fell victim, as those in the Gothic Altstadt did, to the numerous allied air raids of 1943-44.\n\nAbove all the reconstruction considered the needs of urban traffic and accepted modern town planning. Thus, completely new traffic axles were laid, for instance, Konrad-Adenauer-Strasse and the Zeil were considerably widened during their reconstruction. The redevelopment of the city centre brought the Innenstadt into the 1960s. The building of the underground system changed and from 1963, after intense construction measures, a large underground rapid-transit station was built underneath Hauptwache and Konstablerwache. The Zeil and the Freßgas were turned into pedestrian zones and until 1986 most tram lines were shut down. In the western part of the Innenstadt a banking quarter formed around the model of the American Central Business Districts. Since the 1970s this western part has seen numerous new skyscrapers, the best known of which include the Eurotower at Willy-Brandt-Platz and the Commerzbank Tower at Kaiserplatz.\n\nAll Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines have their Frankfurt offices in Innenstadt.\n\n"}

As a result, the responsibility for defence policy lies solely with the Parliament and the Executive. There were 3,442 prosecutions under the Act, almost all of which were successful.\n\nUnder the Act, which was to be read as one with the \"Defence Act 1903-1912\", the Commonwealth could make regulations \"for securing the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth\", including:\n\nLater amendments expanded the scope of regulations to cover:\n\nFrom 1915, the scale of punishments for offences under the Act was:\n\nRegulations issued under the Act required all persons over 16 years of age, on leaving Australia, to possess a passport.\n\nAlthough the Act possessed very broad scope, it was not omnipotent. Other Acts were passed by the Parliament during the war relating to:\n\nDuring the conscription referendums of 1916 and 1917, a regulation that banned statements likely to prejudice recruiting was used to hamper the anti-conscription campaign. Almost any anti-conscriptionist speech could be construed as offending, and a number of prominent anti-conscriptionists were charged, including John Curtin.\n\nWhen coal-miners in New South Wales went on strike in 1916, the Act was used to empower the Attorney-General to order the men back to work. The following year, a nationwide strike of Waterfront workers was defeated by the passing of a regulation that deprived the Waterside Workers Federation of preferences in seven of the busiest ports in Australia. Although in many cases the use of the Act in settling labour disputes could be seen as necessary for the war effort, some other uses appeared calculated to suppress the labour movement. For example, in September 1918 the Act was used to ban the use of the red flag, a traditional labour emblem.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the Act's continued operation lead to a series of violent demonstrations known as the Red Flag Riots.\n\nThe Act was later repealed by the \"War Precautions Act Repeal Act 1920\".\n\n"}

The school also serves a portion of the city of Arcola, sections of the unincorporated area of Fresno, the neighborhood of Lake Shore Harbour, which is located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Missouri City. It also serves a small section of western Pearland. In addition, Hightower previously served the rest of Arcola, sections of master-planned community of Sienna Plantation, and the unincorporated area of Juliff.\n\nThe school is named after Lockhart Valentine (L.V.) Hightower, a former principal in the district. Hightower had served as an American football coach for Sugar Land High School.\n\nHightower opened on August 13, 1998 and was dedicated on October 11 of the same year. The $35 million school campus, when opened, had fewer than 600 students and 50 teachers. The school only served Freshmen and Sophomore classes during its first year. Hightower was FBISD's seventh comprehensive high school.\n\nDebbie Dunlap was the first principal. She said that her style of managing the school was \"to be supportive. I just let the teachers do their jobs.\" Todd Spivak of the \"Houston Press\" said that Dunlap \"was hailed for assembling a staff that some say included the best high school teachers in the Houston area\" and that the school \"quickly gained a reputation for academic excellence and became a destination school for veteran teachers.\" Dunlap left her position in 2003 so she could work for a teacher certification company.\n\nPatricia Paquin became the next principal. Many of the teachers that were at the school during Dunlap's term as principal left during Paquin's term. During each year of Paquin's term, until 2006, between 35 and 55 teachers left. Todd Spivak of the \"Houston Press\" said that many teachers believed that Paquin micromanaged too closely.\n\nIn the 2005-2006 school year, Paquin gave over 1,800 suspensions. Spivak said \"This would appear to indicate the work of a strict disciplinarian. But many teachers and parents say student behavior at Hightower is getting only worse, with fights breaking out on a regular basis.\"\n\nPavlos Karnezis, a 12th grade honors student, was sent to jail and later expelled from school for bringing a knife to class in November 2005. Paquin could have chosen lighter stipulations for Karnezis' expulsion. Despite the fact that teachers had vouched for his character, Paquin had chosen the most severe punishment possible, sentencing him to a boot camp. Karnezis' parents, Thomas and Kathy, fought and had the entire expulsion decision overturned in 2006, allowing Karnezis to return to class.\n\nViretta West was principal from 2008 to 2016. Frederick Richardson was an interim principal for the Fall semester of 2016, and Thomas Wallis was the interim principal for the Spring semester of 2017. The current principal is John Montelongo.\n\nBy 2006 Hightower had over 2,600 students and 140 teachers.\n\nHightower High School, in 2006, was one of the district's only two high schools with block scheduling. Todd Spivak of the \"Houston Press\" said during that year that the school \"is considered the most innovative of the district's seven public high schools\". As of the 2015-16 school year, the school went to a normal 7- period schedule.\n\nHightower has specialized academies that offer specialized education for gifted and ambitious students.\n\nThe Medical Science Academy allows motivated students meet academic challenges and have opportunities to explore world class medical facilities. Courses such as Medical Terminology, Medical Ethics, and much more help to form the basis of knowledge for a medical career. Also, a Medical Science Internship is offered in which students may develop a hands-on experience of the environment in a hospital through volunteer activity.\n\nThe Digital Media Academy allows students to focus on using the computer as a creative tool. Classes are designed to teach technical proficiency in a broad range of software while encouraging innovative design.Graduates from the Graphics & Digital Media strand have the skills to create still graphics, animations, and interactive media using industry standard software. Many specialized courses are available for the many different areas of graphical production.\n\nThe Digital Media Academy] also offers students with the opportunity to create masterpiece media productions. Students will be able to experience hands-on activities that resemble realistic media. Courses allow students to use real world equipment and professional programs to create their works. Also, students are able to assume the roles of professionals and direct their own news-broadcasting channel known as HTV. The academy is now joined together in one academy with the Telecommunications Media Academy as the Digital Media Academy.\n\nIn 2006 Todd Spivak of the \"Houston Press\" said that Hightower's athletic facilities were \"state-of-the-art\" and \"rival those of some colleges.\" Hightower is adjacent to the District owned Hall Stadium and Hopson Field House, resulting in a decrease of transportation for football games.\nAs of February 1, 2016, Hightower is one of the 8 6A schools in the District. In UIL terms, they are in district 6A-20, alongside Austin, Bush, Clements, Dulles, Kempner, Ridgepoint, and Travis High Schools, all of which are Fort Bend.\n\nIn 2016, 72% of the school's student body was African American and Hispanic.\n\nIn 2006, Hightower qualified 16 students for the National HOSA competition in Anaheim, of which all 16 placed top 4 or higher in their respective categories.

It deals with current phonology and phonetics, including geographical variants. Like other High Alemannic varieties, it has a two-way contrast in plosives and fricatives that is not based on voicing, but on length. The absence of voice in plosives and fricatives is typical for all High German varieties, but many of them have no two-way contrast due to general lenition.\n\n\nThere is a distinctive length opposition in all vowels except . Unlike in standard German, there is no interdependence of vowel length and vowel quantity.\n\nBernese German has seven diphthong phonemes:\n\nThe number of phonetic diphthongs and triphthongs is significantly higher, since all monophthongs (except for short , , , ) and all opening diphthongs may be followed by a (from vocalized ), for instance → ('stable'), → ('steel'), → ('feeling').\n\nAdditionally, there are certain combinations with , for instance ('toil') or ('turns' from 'to turn').\n\nIn southern Bernese German (not in the city of Bern), the closing diphthongs merge with the near-close monophthongs to , for instance instead of ('cloth'). This phenomenon is also found in the neighbouring Bernese Highlands and Sense District dialects.\n\nIn northern Bernese German, a following triggers rounding of the preceding vowel, for instance instead of ('because'). This phenomenon is also found in the neighbouring Solothurn and Lucerne dialects.\n\n\nBernese German obstruents occur in pairs, as in other Alemannic varieties. These pairs are usually called fortis and lenis. They are not distinguished by voicedness, but they differ in length. A difference in tenseness is also discussed. It has not been established whether length or tenseness is the primary feature that distinguishes these pairs. Likewise, there are different possibilities of transcription. They are often transcribed with the IPA-signs for pairs of voiceless and voiced obstruents (for instance , ). In order to explicate that no voicedness is involved in the contrast, the diacritic for voicelessness may be used (for instance , ). Another possibility of transcription is the notation of the length, either with the IPA length sign (for instance , ) or with doubling (for instance , ). The opposition is only possible if the obstruents are surrounded by voiced sounds. If there is another adjacent voiceless sound (except ), then there is no opposition.\n\nWith the fricatives, the opposition does not occur at the beginning of a syllable. This is similar to the length opposition that occurs in the continuants . With the stops, however, the opposition is not restricted with respect to syllable structure and also occurs in the syllable onset, for instance ('to bake') vs. ('baked, past participle'); in order for this opposition not to be neutralized, there must be a preceding voiced sound, for instance ('I want to bake a cake') vs. ('I have baked a cake'). In the Northern Bernese German, however, only lenis plosives may occur at the syllable onset, so 'to bake' and 'baked (past participle)' are homophonous as .\n\nAs in other Alemannic dialects, but unlike other Germanic languages, there is no interdependence of the length of a consonant with the length of the preceding vowel. Fortis consonants may occur after either long or short vowels, and lenis consonants as well:\n\nLong is pronounced , for instance → ('ball'); at the end of a syllable , for instance → ('cold').\n\nThis feature is absent in the old upper-class dialect of the patricians.\n\n is pronounced in most cases, for instance → ('dog') or → ('child'). However, there are some words like ('wind') or ('friend') in which is not velarized.\n\nThis feature is absent in the old upper-class dialect of the patricians.\n\nIn the southwestern dialects of the Schwarzenburg area, it is pronounced .\n\nIn the western and southern dialects (not in the city of Bern), is pronounced , for instance → ('to think').\n\nIn native words, the word stem is stressed, except verbs with a separable prefix where that prefix is stressed.\n\nIn loan words, there is – in comparison to standard German – a preference for initial stress, for instance Bernese German ('casino'), ('chalet') vs. standard German , .\n\nLike other High Alemannic varieties, Bernese German shows monosyllabic lengthening in comparison to Middle High German, in words such as ('bath'), ('speech'). However, there is normally no open syllable lengthening, so the corresponding disyllabic words have a short vowel, such as ('to bathe'), ('to speak'). Open syllable lengthening occurs only in a few cases, mainly before and , for example ('to drive') or ('valleys').\n\nA distinctive trait of Bernese German that sets it apart from other High Alemannic varieties is the occurrence of vowel shortening in comparison to Middle High German. This shortening applies most generally before [t] in words such as ('time') or ('loud'). Before other consonants, it may be restricted to disyllabic words, for instance ('finer'), ('to foul') as opposed to monosyllabic ('fine'), ('foul') with an unshortened vowel.\n\nIn the close vowels, the shortened and lengthened vowels remain distinct from originally short and long vowels. This is why the distinction between close and near-close vowels is phonemic, even though the contrast has a low functional load, with only very few actual minimal pairs such as ('rider', shortened vowel) vs. ('knight', originally short vowel) or ('door', lengthened vowel) vs. ('to increase in price', originally long vowel).\n"}

It can also mean an odd habit. The term is often used to express eccentricity or peculiarity. A synonym may be \"quirk\".\n\nThe term \"idiosyncrasy\" originates from Greek \"idiosynkrasía\", \"a peculiar temperament, habit of body\" (from \"idios\", \"one's own\", \"syn\", \"with\" and \"krasis\", \"blend of the four humors\" (temperament)) or literally \"particular mingling\".\n\nThe term can also be applied to symbols or words. \"Idiosyncratic symbols\" mean one thing for a particular person, as a blade could mean war, but to someone else, it could symbolize a surgery.\n\nIn phonology, an \"idiosyncratic property\" contrasts with a \"systematic regularity\". While systematic regularities in the sound system of a language are useful for identifying phonological rules during analysis of the forms morphemes can take, idiosyncratic properties are those whose occurrence is not determined by those rules. For example, the fact that the English word \"cab\" starts with a /k/ is an idiosyncratic property; on the other hand that its vowel is longer than in the English word \"cap\" is a systematic regularity, as it arises from the fact that final consonant is voiced rather than voiceless.\n\nIdiosyncrasy defined the way physicians conceived diseases in the 19th century. They considered each disease as a unique condition, related to each patient. This understanding began to change in the 1870s, when discoveries made by researchers in Europe permitted the advent of a \"scientific medicine\", a precursor to the evidence-based medicine that is the standard of practice today. \n\nThe term idiosyncratic drug reaction denotes an aberrant or bizarre reaction or hypersensitivity to a substance, without connection to the pharmacology of the drug. It is what is known as a Type B reaction. Type B reactions have the following characteristics: They are usually unpredictable, might not be picked up by toxicological screening, not necessarily dose-related, incidence and morbidity low but mortality is high. Type B reactions are most commonly immunological (e.g. penicillin allergy)\n\nIn psychiatry, the term means a specific and unique mental condition of a patient, often accompanied by neologisms. In psychoanalysis and behaviorism, it is used for the personal way a given individual reacts, perceives and experiences a common situation: a certain dish made of meat may cause nostalgic memories in one person and disgust in another. These reactions are called \"idiosyncratic\".\n\nIn portfolio theory, risks of price changes due to the unique circumstances of a specific security, as opposed to the overall market, are called \"idiosyncratic risks\". This specific risk, also called unsystematic, can be nulled out of a portfolio through diversification. Pooling multiple securities means the specific risks cancel out. In complete markets, there is no compensation for idiosyncratic risk—that is, a security's idiosyncratic risk does not matter for its price. For instance, in a complete market in which the capital asset pricing model holds, the price of a security is determined by the amount of systematic risk in its returns. Net income received, or losses suffered, by a landlord from renting of one or two properties is subject to idiosyncratic risk due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.\n\nAccording to one macroeconomic model including a financial sector, hedging idiosyncratic risk can be self-defeating as it leads to higher systemic risk, as it takes on more leverage. This makes the system less stable. Thus, while securitisation in principle reduces the costs of idiosyncratic shocks it ends up amplifying systemic risks in equilibrium.\n\nIn econometrics, \"idiosyncratic error\" is used to describe error—that is, unobserved factors that impact the dependent variable—from panel data that both changes over time and across units (individuals, firms, cities, etc.).\n\n"}

In his earlier life he was enslaved as a stockman at Wave Hill Station. He also played the didgeridoo. Lingiari was elected and became the leader of the Gurindji communities in August 1966. On 7 June 1976, Lingiari was named a Member of the Order of Australia for his services to the Aboriginal people. The story of Lingiari was celebrated in the song \"From Little Things Big Things Grow\".\n\nWave Hill Cattle Station is located approximately 600 km south of Darwin in the Northern Territory. From the late 19th century it was run by the British pastoral company Vesteys. Vesteys employed the local Indigenous people, the Gurindji, to work on Wave Hill. But working conditions were extremely poor and wages were very low when compared to those of non-Indigenous employees.\nIn 1966, Lingiari, a member of the Gurindji, worked at Wave Hill and had recently returned from a period of hospitalisation in Darwin and led a walk-off of indigenous employees of Wave Hill as a protest against the work and conditions. While there had been complaints from Indigenous employees about conditions on Wave Hill over many years, including an inquiry during the 1930s that was critical of Vestey's employment practices, the walk-off had a focus that was aimed at a wider target than Vestey's. Before 1968 it was illegal to pay an indigenous worker more than a specified amount in goods and money. In many cases, the government benefits for which Indigenous employees were eligible were paid into pastoral companies’ accounts, rather than to the individuals.\n\nThe protesters established the Wattie Creek Camp and demanded the return of some of their traditional lands. Speaking on this Lingiari said, \"We want to live on our land, our way.\" So began the eight-year fight by the Gurindji people to obtain title to their land.\n\nThe Wave Hill strike would eventually reshape the agenda of relationships between Indigenous Australians and the wider community. Although initially an employee-rights action, it soon became a major federal issue when the Gurindji people demanded the return of their traditional lands.\n\nThe strike lasted eight years. Over that time, support for Aboriginal rights grew as the struggle intensified. The protest eventually led to the \"Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976\". This act gave indigenous Australians freehold title to traditional lands in the Northern Territory and, significantly, the power to negotiate over mining and development on those lands, including what type of compensation they would like.\n\nAn important and symbolic event in Australian history occurred when, during an emotional ceremony in 1975, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam poured the local sand into Lingiari's hands, symbolically handing the Wave Hill station back to the Gurindji people. A photograph of the moment captured by Mervyn Bishop was purchased by the National Portrait Gallery and is displayed in Old Parliament House.\n\nOn 7 June 1976, Lingiari was named a Member of the Order of Australia for his services to the Aboriginal people.\n\nLingiari died on 21 January 1988. Every year until then he attended the Gurindji’s annual re-enactment of the walk-off.\n\nLingiari was a leader and holder of the cultural authority of the Gurindji people. His fight for his people's rights – to the custodianship and ownership of their land and the capacity to practise their law, culture and language – made him a national figure. He confronted the vast economic and political forces that were arrayed against him and his people. In doing so, he won a victory that is one of the most outstanding achievements in the history of the struggle for the recognition of Indigenous people, their rights and responsibilities in the land, and their ability to practice their law, language and culture. One of Australia's largest electorates is named after Lingiari. The Division of Lingiari encompasses nearly all of the Northern Territory as well as Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands. It includes Daguragu and traditional Gurindji lands.\n\nThe story of Lingiari was celebrated in the song \"From Little Things Big Things Grow\" written by Paul Kelly and Indigenous musician Kev Carmody and recorded by Kelly in 1991.\n\n"}

{"id": "2309335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309335", "title": "Bikar Atoll", "text": "Bikar Atoll\n\nBikar Atoll (Marshallese: , ) is an uninhabited atoll in the Ratak Chain of the Marshall Islands. It is one of the smallest atolls in the Marshalls. Due to its relative isolation from the main islands in the group, Bikar's flora and fauna has been able to exist in a relatively pristine condition.\n\nIt is located north of Majuro Atoll, the capital of the Marshall Islands, South-southeast of Bokak, and north of Utirik, the nearest inhabited atoll. The land area is , surrounding a lagoon. It consists of 6 islets.\n\nThe approximately diamond-shaped atoll measures up to 13 km north to south and up to 8 km across. Its six islets have a combined land area of less than and enclose a shallow lagoon of . The surrounding reef is continuous except for one narrow pass located on the western side. The major islets are Bikar, Jabwelo, Almani and Jaboero. Bikar, the largest, reaches a height of 6 meters above sea level.\n\nBased on the results of drilling operations on Enewetak (Eniwetok) Atoll, in the nearby Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands, Bikar may include as much as 4600 feet of reef material atop a basalt rock base. As most local coral growth stops at about 150 feet below the ocean surface, such a massive stony coral base suggests a gradual isostatic subsidence of the underlying extinct volcano, which itself rises 10,000 feet from the surrounding ocean floor. Shallow water fossils taken from just above Enewetak's basalt base are dated to about 55 mya.\n\nLow rainfall and high temperatures lead to arid conditions in which a freshwater Ghyben-Herzberg lens cannot form. The water at Bikar island is not as brackish as similarly arid Taongi Atoll, allowing coconuts planted by visiting islanders from Utirik Atoll to survive.\n\nLike Taongi Atoll, the combination of an almost completely enclosed lagoon and waves driven over the reef by the prevailing northeastern trade winds results in the water level being perched some 0.5 m above the mean tide level.\n\nBikar is one of the driest of the Marshall Islands atolls, having a semi-arid character. Mean annual temperature is approximately . Mean annual rainfall is less than , and falls primarily during the July through October rainy season. Prevailing winds are north to north-easterlies.\n\nPlant species of atoll forest include \"Pandanus tectorius\", \"Lepturus repens\", \"Cocos nucifera\", \"Boerhavia repens\", \"Pisonia grandis\", \"Portulaca lutea\", \"Triumfetta procumbens\", \"Tournefortia argentea\" and \"Scaevola sericea\", as well as areas of atoll scrub and vines. Much of the \"Pisonia\" forest noted in earlier surveys was devastated by a cyclone, perhaps Typhoon Mary in 1977. This is likely a naturally recurring event. A small number of coconut palms planted by visiting islanders survive. A 1952 survey found that they produced small nuts containing bitter milk.\n\nBikar's status as a major seabird nesting site was affected by a cyclone and the introduction of more aggressive rat species.\n\nTwenty-three species of birds were found in a 1969 survey, of which 19 were observed during a follow-up count in 1988. Species breeding in larger numbers that year included the great frigatebird and red-footed booby. Their numbers appear reduced due to the destruction of the \"Pisonia\" forests. Other breeding species include the red-tailed tropicbird, white-tailed tropicbird, the masked booby, brown booby, white tern, brown noddy, and sooty tern.\n\nMigrant birds include small numbers of the ruddy turnstone, wandering tattler, bristle-thighed curlew, lesser golden plover, and Pacific reef heron.\n\nBikar is also a major nesting site for the endangered green turtle, over 250 nesting sites having been observed in 1988.\n\nThe Polynesian rat is common on Bikar and Jabwelo. By 1993, a \"population explosion\" of non-Polynesian rats had been noted on the atoll, most likely introduced by Asian fishing trawlers operating illegally in the vicinity of Bikar. This raised concerns for the important sea turtle and bird nesting sites.\n\nThe coral fauna lacks diversity and shows signs of frequent storm damage. The corals include several genera not seen at Taongi Atoll, and the diversity of fish is much greater, including the two-spot red snapper, humpback red snapper, leopard grouper, and humphead parrot fish.\n\nShellfish include the black-lipped pearl oyster, bear paw clam, maxima clam, and the \"Trochus\" sea snail. No marine mammals have been seen in the lagoon.\n\nAlthough humans migrated to the Marshall Islands about 2000 years ago, and Bikar was occasionally visited by the Marshallese, there is no evidence that there has ever been a resident human population. The lack of water and the susceptibility of the atoll to cyclone and storm disturbance indicate that it will probably remain uninhabited. The atoll has traditionally been used for hunting and gathering, particularly seabirds and turtles, by inhabitants of other atolls in the northern Ratak chain. Along with the other uninhabited northern Ratak atolls of Bokak (Taongi) and Toke, Bikar was traditionally the hereditary property of the Ratak atoll chain Iroji Lablab. The exploitation of abundant sea turtles, birds, and eggs was regulated by custom, and overseen by the Iroji.\n\nThe Russian brig \"Rurik\", with Captain Otto von Kotzebue, visited in summer 1817 during a search for a north passage between western Russia and its North American territories.\n\nThe French corvette \"Danaide\", Capt J. de Rosamel, visited the atoll in August 1840 during a hydrographical survey of islands in the Pacific.\nDuring the late 1800s, Bikar was the subject of a number of commercial transactions related to the increasing German presence in the Marshall Islands. On January 12, 1880, Bikar was sold by Iroojs Jurtaka and Takular of Maloelap, and on June 19, sold by Irooj Lajikit and Tannara of Utirik to Adolph Capelle & Co. On December 18, 1883, the Atoll was sold to Deutsche Handels und Plantagengesellschaft. Spain transferred sovereignty to the Empire of Germany in 1885, and in December 1887 property rights were transferred to the Jaluit Gesellschaft.\n\nIn 1900, the \"Manchester\", a four-masted steel hulled cargo ship of 2851 tons with a load of kerosene, went missing at sea between New York City and Yokohama. Wreckage and signs of habitation were discovered on Bikar in 1901, suggesting that the ship had come to grief there and that the survivors had pushed off in lifeboats shortly before the discovery. No sign of the crew or passengers has since been found.\n\nIn 1914, the Empire of Japan occupied the Marshall Islands, and transferred German government properties to their own, including Bikar. Like the Germans before them, the Japanese colonial administration (the South Pacific Mandate) did not attempt to exploit the atoll, and the Northern Radak Marshallese continued to hunt and fish unmolested. Following the end of World War II, the island came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. In 1951, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Army Corps of Engineers sponsored an expedition to Bikar and Taongi Atolls, to characterize their primeval environment.\n\nWhile en route from the US to Asia in April 1953, LST 1138, later commissioned as , dropped anchor at Bikar to search for rumored Japanese stragglers. The landing party found no signs of any current occupants.\nIn 1954, the fallout plume from the Castle Bravo nuclear test passed over Bikar about 20 hours after the shot. Based on ash from plant samples taken on March 9, the atoll was contaminated by about 1,400,000 d/m/gm of radioactive material, compared with 35,000,000 d/m/gm from the most contaminated soil samples at Rongelap Atoll, and 950 d/m/gm at Majuro Atoll, several hundred miles south of the fallout pattern. This experience led to a pre-planned aerial survey of atolls adjacent to the subsequent March 27 Castle Romeo test, timed at one and four hours after the shot. The aircraft were equipped with gamma radiation detectors designed to measure ground contamination from altitudes of 200 to 500 feet. An overflight of Bikar Island measured 0.1 mrem/hr (1 μGy) an hour after the shot, rising to 15 mrem/hr (150 μGy) three hours later.\nIn 1962, 19 Japanese fishermen from the fishing boat \"Daitei Maru No. 15\" were marooned on Bikar Atoll for several days before being rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nA 1981 study of fish and invertebrates within the lagoon found that the level of radio-nucleotides in muscle tissue was within the range found in fish products imported to the US and Japanese markets. The worldwide source of seafood-borne radio-nucleotides is a result of atmospheric nuclear testing since 1945, and therefore any residual activity from the 1950s Castle series of tests contributes only a small fraction of the contamination within the lagoon's sea life.\n\nCurrently, no archaeological remains of Polynesian habitation have been identified. The almost completed corroded wreck of a Japanese fishing boat lies in the north fork of the reef passage.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2309354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309354", "title": "Jesús Malverde", "text": "Jesús Malverde\n\nJesús Malverde (\"literally translating to Jesus Evilgreen\"), possibly born as Jesús Juarez Mazo (1870–1909) (), sometimes known as the \"Cjuba Lord\", \"angel of the poor\", or the \"narco-saint\", is a folklore hero in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. \n\nHe was of Yoreme and Spanish heritage. He is a \"Robin Hood figure\" who was supposed to have stolen from the rich to give to the poor. He is celebrated as a folk saint by some in Mexico and the United States, particularly among drug traffickers.\n\nThe existence of Malverde is not historically verified. He is said to have been born Jesús Juarez Mazo, growing up under the rule of Mexican dictator Porfirio Diaz, whose local supporter Francisco Cañedo ran Sinaloa. He is supposed to have become a bandit after the death of his parents, which he attributed to their poverty. During Malverde’s youth, railroads arrived. He witnessed his community undergo rapid socioeconomic transformation. The profits of hacienda agriculture were enjoyed by the few elite, while the vast majority of the population, the peasantry, faced even greater economic strain. Jesús Malverde is said to have been a carpenter, tailor or railway worker. It was not until his parents died of either hunger or a curable disease (depending on the version of the story) that Jesús Malverde turned to a life of banditry. His nickname Malverde (evil-green) was given by his wealthy victims, deriving from an association between green and misfortune. \n\nAccording to the mythology of Malverde's life, Cañedo derisively offered Malverde a pardon if he could steal the governor's sword (or in some versions his daughter). The bandit succeeded, but this only pushed Cañedo into hunting him down. He is supposed to have died in Sinaloa on May 3rd 1909. Accounts of his death vary. In some versions he was betrayed and killed by a friend. In others he was shot or hanged by local police. His body was supposed to have been denied proper burial, being left to rot in public as an example.\n\nWriter Sam Quinones says that there is no evidence that the Malverde of the legend ever lived, and that the story probably emerged by mixing material from the lives of two documented Sinaloan bandits, Heraclio Bernal (1855–1888) and Felipe Bachomo (1883–1916). Bernal was a thief from southern Sinaloa who later became an anti-government rebel. Cañedo offered a reward for his capture, and he was betrayed and killed by former colleagues. Bachomo was an indigenous Indian rebel from northern Sinaloa who was captured and executed.\n\nSince Malverde's supposed death, he has earned a Robin Hood-type image, making him popular among Sinaloa's poor highland residents. His bones were said to have been unofficially buried by local people, who threw stones onto them, creating a cairn. Throwing a stone onto the bones was thus a sign of respect, and gave the person the right to make a petition to his spirit. His earliest alleged miracles involved the return of lost or stolen property. His shrine is in Culiacan, capital of Sinaloa. Every year on the anniversary of his death a large party is held at Malverde's shrine. The original shrine was built over in the 1970s, amid much controversy, and a new shrine was built on nearby land.

According to Patricia Price, \"Narcotrafickers have strategically used Malverde's image as a 'generous bandit' to spin their own images as Robin Hoods of sorts, merely stealing from rich drug-addicted gringos and giving some of their wealth back to their Sinaloa hometowns, in the form of schools, road improvements, community celebrations.\"\n\nSpiritual supplies featuring the visage of Jesús Malverde are available in the United States as well as in Mexico.

The Univision-owned station is licensed to Deer Park, Texas, and is a class C2 FM (equivalent to 50,000 watts at 500 feet). The transmitter is located on the historic (1948) KNUZ tower, along with sister station KLTN, at 315 N. Ennis Street in the East End. The studios are located in the Univision building in Uptown Houston, on the Southwest Freeway (U.S. Highway 59).\n\nOriginally, KAMA-FM was licensed to Rosenberg, Texas on January 7, 1969 as KFRD-FM, the sister to AM 980 KFRD, and originally utilized the AM counterpart's country music format.\n\n104.9, since being owned by Univision, and its Tichenor predecessor, has switched formats many times. 104.9 was once in simulcast with KQBU-FM as both Spanish Adult Contemporary \"K-Love\" and Regional Mexican \"Estereo Latino\". After it broke off the simulcast with 93.3, 104.9 became an English language station once again, the first time since moving from Rosenberg, as \"The House Party, 104.9\" featuring a Rhythmic CHR format targeting second and third generation Hispanics. Once the 104.9 facility was moved from Missouri City to the Wells Fargo building, 104.9 simply rebranded as \"Party 104.9\".\n\nThe 104.9 facility has also moved its Community of License (or COL) on 2 separate occasions. Having originated in Rosenberg, it then was moved to the Wells Fargo building in downtown Houston, and relicensed to Missouri City, Texas. After a few years, Univision moved 104.9 once again, as well as increased power of the station to 10.5 kilowatts. This time, 104.9 would move to the historic East End of downtown Houston's Ennis Street tower, which has historically housed both Univision co-owned 102.9 KLTN, as well as the original sister to 102.9, 1230 KNUZ (now KCOH). With the change to physical location at the Ennis tower, KAMA also changed COL again to its current Deer Park, Texas license. 104.9 also gained a simulcast partner as 105.3, licensed to Crystal Beach, Texas would become Party as well, however there was never a mention of the station except for at the required hourly identification for the two. Univision applied for and was granted a similar call sign to 104.9's KPTY, as it became KPTI during the simulcast and remained so until it assumed the KPTY calls after the demise of the Party format on 93.3.\n\nOn December 4, 2007, the station dropped the Rhythmic format and became \"Amor\", a Latin pop format. \"Party 104.9\", and the KPTY calls were moved to 93.3 FM in Port Arthur, Texas, replacing Regional Mexican KQBU-FM. 104.9 remained in simulcast with 105.3 KPTI Winnie (now KXXF) until 105.3 was to Excel Media. “Amor” competed with KLOL and KQQK.\n\nIn January 2008, Univision rebranded KAMA-FM from \"Amor 104.9\" to \"104.9 Tu Musica\".\n\nOn September 28, 2014, KAMA rebranded as \"104.9 Latino Mix\". The new branding focuses more on Spanish Urban music (like Reggaeton) as well as Bachata.\n\nOn December 1, 2017, sister station KQBU-FM changed their Regional Mexican format to simulcast with KAMA-FM. This gives KAMA-FM a strong signal to the Houston market, as well as serving the Golden Triangle (Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange) a Spanish Pop format.\n\n"}

{"id": "2309382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309382", "title": "Plaid Pantry", "text": "Plaid Pantry\n\nPlaid Pantry is a chain of privately owned convenience stores based in Beaverton, Oregon, United States. Of 108 locations, one is in the Seattle, Washington, area, eight are near Salem, and the remainder are in the Portland metropolitan area.\n\nPlaid Pantries, Inc. traces its founding to 1960 by John Piacentini. The name refers to the plaid decoration originally on both the store buildings and the roadside pole signs.\n\nPlaid Pantry can date its origins to the late 1950s when a California investor built multiple stores in the Portland area with the financial backing of Alpenrose Dairy. Stores built from scratch by Handy Pantry/Alpenrose were under the Handy Pantry name; stores made by converting an existing structure were referred to as Speedy Mart. In 1963, the Handy Pantry/Speedy Mart chain filed for bankruptcy. Alpenrose Dairy, the major creditor, gained control of all the stores.\n\nIn 1960, John Piacentini decided to go into business for himself and opened his first store in east Portland under the name John's One-Stop. He opened a few more stores and eventually was offered the opportunity to purchase the Handy Pantry/Speedy Mart chain with financial backing by Alpenrose Dairy. Piacentini changed the name of all the stores to Plaid Pantry; the stores continued to stock Alpenrose Dairy products.\n\nNearly 20 years later, when Piacentini tentatively sold the company to Convenient Food Mart (CFM) in March 1987, he had built it into a chain of 161 stores in the Portland and Seattle areas. That sale fell through about two months later, after CFM conducted its due diligence audit. A subsequent leveraged buyout a year later led to chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 13, 1989, and a subsequent reorganization. Piacentini died later in 1988, and several lawsuits followed.\n\nA series of transactions made public in 1998 put half of the chain under the ownership of a holding company majority-owned by Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin (HLHZ), with minority ownership stakes held by senior Plaid Pantry management including CEO Chris Girard.\n\nThe details of the 1998 deal and several subsequent transactions became the subject of a lawsuit in 2007 before the United States District Court for the District of Oregon between HLHZ and Girard. The lawsuit was settled in 2008.\n\nIn May 2019, the company terminated an employee who produced a gun during an attempted robbery involving a suspect with a hatchet at one of its Clackamas County stores. The reason given for termination is for violating the company's no weapon policy.\n\nIn 1969, as the Oregon Bottle Bill was contemplated as a way to reduce litter, large retailers opposed the idea and said that no one would return bottles and cans for a two-cent deposit. Furthermore, opponents of the bill claimed that small grocery stores would face an extraordinary financial burden from receiving and processing thousands of bottles and cans, potentially bankrupting several stores. John Piacentini disagreed. He offered a half cent for each soda or beer bottle returned to Plaid Pantry stores. Piacentini even stated that he hoped Oregonians \"bury me in litter.\" \nIn two weeks, Piacentini collected 150,000 cans at 60 stores.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Plaid Pantry failed 30-40% of spot checks conducted by the OLCC to determine if the company was selling alcohol or tobacco to minors; by March 2000, they became the first retailer recognized by the OLCC as a \"responsible vendor\", a milestone reached due to changes to the company's training and its credit card validation system, which were updated to simplify a clerk's ability to ascertain whether a customer was of legal age.\n\n"}
{"id": "2309394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309394", "title": "Ådalen shootings", "text": "Ådalen shootings\n\nThe Ådalen shootings () was a series of events in and around the sawmill district of Ådalen, Kramfors Municipality, Ångermanland, Sweden, in May 1931. During a protest on 14 May, five people were killed by bullets fired by troops called in as reinforcements by the police.\n\nAs a response to a drawn-out industrial conflict over pay reductions at the pulp factory at Långrör, workers at other plants went on a sympathy strike. The owner of the Graninge company, Gerhard Versteegh, hired around 60 strike-breakers, who arrived in the village of Lunde in Ådalen on 12 May. The workers held a protest rally in Kramfors and marched to the Sandviken plant north of the town, where they approached and attacked some of the strike-breakers. Since the police had not been able to stop the attack, the County Administrative Board asked for the deployment of members of the military from Sollefteå to protect the strike-breakers. When the troops arrived in the late evening of 13 May, they were met by protesters, allegedly throwing stones.\n\nOn 14 May the unions held another rally, during which the attending workers decided to stop all work in the timber and pulp industries in Ådalen—a general strike. After the meeting, several thousand participants marched to the strike-breakers' quarters in Lunde, where the troops had been ordered to defend the strike-breakers. When they arrived in the village, a patrol of mounted troops tried unsuccessfully to stop them. In the confusion that followed, at least one man fell off his horse and another drew his pistol and fired warning shots while the patrol withdrew. The military commander, Capt. Nils Mesterton, said later that he believed the demonstrators carried weapons since he heard shots as well as seeing some of the mounted patrol bleeding. At a distance of less than 100 metres he, in accordance with orders from the present policeman in charge, ordered his troops to fire, which they did, aiming as planned at the ground halfway between the line and the demonstrators. However, ricochets hit the gathered demonstrators, who scattered, and the captain ordered the machine gun fired. Five people were shot to death: Oskar Berggren, Erik Bergström, Evert Nygren, Sture Larsson and Eira Söderberg, a 20-year-old bystander. Five people were injured. An inquiry later concluded that there was no evidence that the workers were in fact armed.\n\nOn that same day the County Administrative Board had decided to prohibit the strike-breakers from working. Their decision did not reach the demonstrators until after the shooting. It is widely believed that the confrontation could have been avoided if the news had reached the marchers earlier. The Swedish Employers' Association later asked the Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsmen to review the decision.\n\nThe events spawned a raging national debate, deeply divided along political lines. The political left called the shootings \"murder\", while the right claimed that the military had been forced to open fire to defend themselves and the \"willing workers\" from the rage of the demonstrators. The publishers of several left-wing newspapers were convicted for violations against the limitations in the Freedom of the Press Act. Major demonstrations took place in Stockholm.\n\nThe County Governor was tried in court but acquitted. Capt. Mesterton and Capt. Beckman were initially convicted in a court martial, but were acquitted on appeal and that verdict was confirmed by the supreme court. Sgt. Rask and Sgt. Tapper, who were manning the machine gun, were also put on trial since repositioning had been performed with a loaded weapon, which was against army regulations. Rask was acquitted while Tapper was found guilty and sentenced to three days' confined arrest with loss of pay. On the other hand, several demonstrators had to face severe sentences: Axel Nordström, considered to be the leader, was sentenced to two and half years' imprisonment with hard labor. No damages were awarded to the wounded demonstrators or to the families of the five dead.\n\nThe government, under the liberal Prime Minister Carl Gustaf Ekman, replaced the County Governor and launched an investigation into the event. The investigation, with representatives from both employers and trade unions, later concluded that the military was highly unfit to uphold public order in similar situations. The use of the military against civilians was more strictly regulated, but the legislation was on the books until it was repealed by the 1969 Riksdag. However, there was broad political agreement not to use military force against civilians. The Ådalen shootings were still a concern in the discussions after the 9/11 events in the US, when military support to the police was considered. Therefore, the subsequent legislation that allowed the military to take part in anti-terrorism actions contained several safeguards. The military must be under command of the police, as they were in Ådalen in 1931, and legislation specifically says that the military cannot be used against demonstrations. There was still concern that these safeguards would not be enough.\n\nAt the time of the 1931 events, it was not possible to call in police reinforcements from outside the county. Thus, army assistance was the only recourse available to a county governor when the county's police force would be insufficient to deal with large-scale events. The shootings highlighted the inadequacy of this state of affairs. One effect of the Ådalen shootings was the formation of a national police force in 1933.\n\nThe leadership of the Social Democratic banned members to attend the funerals of the killed protesters as they were regarded as collaborators with the revolutionary communist party.\n\nIn 1969 well-known Swedish filmmaker Bo Widerberg told the story of the events in his film \"Ådalen 31\" (released as \"Adalen Riots\" in the US). Partly thanks to the film and partly through the persistent use of the events in political debate, the Ådalen shootings are still well known in Sweden, and are sometimes referred to in connection with violent clashes between demonstrators and police such as the 2001 EU summit protests in Gothenburg.\n\nThe incident is also mentioned several times in the 1979 Swedish comedy film \"Repmånad\".\n\n"}

They represented Singapore in the 1984 ASEAN Club Games, finishing third, then captured The Double in 1987. The early 1990s saw further successes, as they were Pools Cup winners in 1991 and 1993, finished runners-up in the FAS Premier League from 1991 to 1993 and bagged the FA Cup in 1994. Their strong performances led to their selection as one of eight clubs to compete in the newly formed S.League, so in 1995, they were renamed to Tiong Bahru Football Club and obtained a permanent home at the Queenstown Stadium.\n\nIn 2017, the owners of Tanjong Pagar United stated their intent to return to Singapore Premier League for the 2019 season, and on November 2017 applied to FAS to rejoin the league.

Anne, dressed in male attire, rode around the glens and, in a very short time, enlisted 97 of the 100 men required for the captaincy. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, Angus' company fought for Lord Loudon's Government forces, aka. the Black Watch, in the Highlands.\n\nWhen the Jacobite \"Prince\" Charles Edward Stuart landed in Scotland in 1745, Anne, then 22 years old, forcefully raised between 200 and 400 men from Clan Mackintosh and the confederation of Clan Chattan for the Prince. As women could not command in the field, the regiment was placed under the command of the chief of the Clan MacGillivray, a member of the confederation. 'Colonel' Anne's regiment joined the Prince's army at Bannockburn, near Stirling Castle, in January 1746, 12 days before the Battle of Falkirk Muir.\n\nA month later the Prince was staying at Moy Hall, Lady Anne's home. She received a message from her mother-in-law that 1,500 of Lord Loudon's men, including her husband's company stationed 8–12 miles away at Inverness, were planning a night raid on Moy Hall to snatch the Prince (and claim the £30,000 bounty). Anne sent five of her staff out with guns to crash about and shout clan battle cries to trick the Government forces into thinking they were about to face the entire Jacobite army. The ploy worked and the Government force fled. The event became known as The Rout of Moy.\n\nThe next month her husband, who supported the Government and 300 of Loudon's men were captured north of Inverness by the Jacobites. The Prince paroled Captain Mackintosh into the custody of his wife, Lady MacKintosh, commenting \"he could not be in better security, or more honourably treated\". She famously greeted him with the words, \"Your servant, captain\" to which he replied, \"your servant, colonel\" thereby giving her the nickname \"Colonel Anne\". She was also called \"La Belle Rebelle\" (the beautiful rebel) by the Prince himself.\n\nAfter the Jacobite defeat at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746, Lady M was arrested and turned over to the care of her mother-in-law for a time. Lady Anne stepped in to stop Anne McKay, a local Inverness woman who helped Jacobite officer Robert Nairn escape, being whipped through the streets of Inverness. Lady Anne later met Prince William, Duke of Cumberland at a social event in London with her husband. He asked her to dance to a pro-Government tune and she returned the favour by asking him to dance to a Jacobite tune.\n\nShe died on 2 March 1784 at Leith. She is buried in North Leith Graveyard on Coburg Street. Her grave is marked by a white Jacobite rose and a commemorative plaque.\n\n\n\n"}

The centrifugal force thus generated encourages a successful pour.\n\nCentrifugal casting, or \"centrifuging\", is used as a means of casting small, detailed parts or jewelry. An articulated arm is free to spin around a vertical axle, which is driven by an electric motor or a spring. The entire mechanism is enclosed in a tub or drum to contain hot metal should the mold break or an excess of metal be used. Single use molds are prepared using the lost wax method. A small amount of metal in a crucible (a sort of ceramic pan) next to the mold is heated with a torch. When the metal is molten the arm is released, forcing (by centrifugal force) the metal into the mold. The high forces imposed on the metal overcome the viscosity, resulting in a finely detailed workpiece. A similar advantage may be obtained by vacuum casting or pressure casting.\n\nFor casting of small parts using hot metal, a disk shaped mold is contained within a rotating drum, and molten metal is poured into the center.\n\nMany machines are available which can perform centrifugal casting, and they are relatively simple to construct. All that is required is an arm which rotates with an adequate amount of centrifugal force, a container on the end of said arm to hold both a mold and the material to be cast into the mold.\n\n"}

It is a sequel to \"Ground Control\", the award-winning game of the same genre. Much like its predecessor, it features 3D graphics and a fully rotational camera system.\n\nSimilar to the first \"Ground Control\", \"Operation Exodus\" focuses on combat tactics rather than base construction or managing an economy. However, unlike its purely real-time tactics predecessor, \"Ground Control II\" has a resource system called \"acquisition\". Acquisition points are earned through the capturing of \"victory locations\" and destruction of enemy forces and allow the player to field units on the battlefield and use the support weapons that are unique to each faction. The game is also significantly faster paced than its predecessor and moves along at a pace similar to real-time strategy games such as \"Command & Conquer\".\n\nThe game features a three-sided conflict. However, only two of the factions, the Northern Star Alliance and the Viron Nomads, are actually playable. The Terran Empire is a non-playable faction featured only in the single-player campaign. The two playable sides feature a total of 33 units available. All of these units are deployed onto the battlefield through dropships, much like the deployment procedures of its predecessor. These units include infantry, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, aircraft, artillery, and static emplacements. Unlike \"Ground Control\", however, unit customization is unavailable; each individual unit features a fixed secondary function.\n\nThe story of \"Ground Control II\" takes place in that same universe as that of the original game but starts 320 years later and has little in common with the original game. The human race has discovered faster than light travel and has colonized the galaxy. There are two groups of colonies in this universe, dubbed the Inner Sphere and Outer Sphere. A fictional physical phenomenon causes the communications between the two area to be only possible through a network of special relay stations built at the border of the spheres. Intergalactic travel is also impossible due to a fictional unexplained barrier between the galaxies.\n\nAfter the battle of Krig-7b that took place in the original video game, Major Sarah Parker (the original game's protagonist) destroyed the Earth's early warning relay station, commandeered a battlecruiser called \"CSS Astrid\" (seen in the original game) and escaped. In the next centuries, a stellar war that lasted 70 years changed the political layout of the colonies. A colony called Draconis Empire subjugated the Inner Sphere and established the Empire of Terra. It destroyed the communication relays, severing communications with the Outer Sphere. The next two hundred years was the age of strife for the Outer Sphere, for they had to rediscover the precious knowledge to which they no longer had access. Eventually, the Outer Sphere colonies formed two interstellar states: The Northern Star Alliance (NSA) and the Intergalactic Trade Guild (ITG). After the two hundred years however, the Empire of Terra invaded the Outer Sphere and began taking over the NSA. In 40 years of battle that followed, the Empire took most of the NSA territory and finally invaded the Morningstar Prime, the capital of NSA.\n\nThe game begins with Captain Jacob Angelus becoming a field commander for the NSA. Despite Captain Angelus's \"exceptional\" battlefield performance, it is clear that NSA cannot win this war and it is only a matter of time before the Empire overwhelm them. However, an unknown spacecraft crashes on Morningstar Prime which Captain Angelus secures. NSA scientists who study the craft reveal that Major Parker outfitted \"CSS Astrid\" with an ancient device called a \"Singularity Drive\" that enables the ship to bypass the intergalactic barrier and travel to other galaxies. NSA plans to use the ship to evacuate NSA citizens to another galaxy, where the Empire cannot follow.

{"id": "2309427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309427", "title": "Magnetosphere of Saturn", "text": "Magnetosphere of Saturn\n\nThe magnetosphere of Saturn is the cavity created in the flow of the solar wind by the planet's internally generated magnetic field. Discovered in 1979 by the \"Pioneer 11\" spacecraft, Saturn's magnetosphere is the second largest of any planet in the Solar System after Jupiter. The magnetopause, the boundary between Saturn's magnetosphere and the solar wind, is located at a distance of about 20 Saturn radii from the planet's center, while its magnetotail stretches hundreds of Saturn radii behind it.\n\nSaturn's magnetosphere is filled with plasmas originating from both the planet and its moons. The main source is the small moon Enceladus, which ejects as much as 1,000 kg/s of water vapor from the geysers on its south pole, a portion of which is ionized and forced to co-rotate with the Saturn’s magnetic field. This loads the field with as much as 100 kg of water group ions per second. This plasma gradually moves out from the inner magnetosphere via the interchange instability mechanism and then escapes through the magnetotail.\n\nThe interaction between Saturn's magnetosphere and the solar wind generates bright oval aurorae around the planet's poles observed in visible, infrared and ultraviolet light. The aurorae are related to the powerful saturnian kilometric radiation (SKR), which spans the frequency interval between 100 kHz to 1300 kHz and was once thought to modulate with a period equal to the planet's rotation. However, later measurements showed that the periodicity of the SKR's modulation varies by as much as 1%, and so probably does not exactly coincide with Saturn’s true rotational period, which as of 2010 remains unknown. Inside the magnetosphere there are radiation belts, which house particles with energy as high as tens of megaelectronvolts. The energetic particles have significant influence on the surfaces of inner icy moons of Saturn.\n\nIn 1980–1981 the magnetosphere of Saturn was studied by the \"Voyager\" spacecraft. Up until September 2017 it was a subject of ongoing investigation by Cassini mission, which arrived in 2004 and spent over 13 years observing the planet.\n\nImmediately after the discovery of Jupiter's decametric radio emissions in 1955, attempts were made to detect a similar emission from Saturn, but with inconclusive results. The first evidence that Saturn might have an internally generated magnetic field came in 1974, with the detection of weak radio emissions from the planet at the frequency of about 1 MHz.\n\nThese medium wave emissions were modulated with a period of about , which was interpreted as Saturn's rotation period. Nevertheless, the evidence available in the 1970s was too inconclusive and some scientists thought that Saturn might lack a magnetic field altogether, while others even speculated that the planet could lie beyond the heliopause. The first definite detection of the saturnian magnetic field was made only on September 1, 1979, when it was passed through by the Pioneer 11 spacecraft, which measured its magnetic field strength directly.\n\nLike Jupiter's magnetic field, Saturn's is created by a fluid dynamo within a layer of circulating liquid metallic hydrogen in its outer core. Like Earth, Saturn's magnetic field is mostly a dipole, with north and south poles at the ends of a single magnetic axis. On Saturn, like on Jupiter, the north magnetic pole is located in the northern hemisphere, and the south magnetic pole lies in the southern hemisphere, so that magnetic field lines point away from the north pole and towards the south pole. This is reversed compared to the Earth, where the north magnetic pole lies in the southern hemisphere. Saturn's magnetic field also has quadrupole, octupole and higher components, though they are much weaker than the dipole.\n\nThe magnetic field strength at Saturn's equator is about 21 μT (0.21 G), which corresponds to a dipole magnetic moment of about 4.6 T•m. This makes Saturn's magnetic field slightly weaker than Earth's; however, its magnetic moment is about 580 times larger. Saturn's magnetic dipole is strictly aligned with its rotational axis, meaning that the field, uniquely, is highly axisymmetric. The dipole is slightly shifted (by 0.037 R) along Saturn's rotational axis towards the north pole.\n\nSaturn's internal magnetic field deflects the solar wind, a stream of ionized particles emitted by the Sun, away from its surface, preventing it from interacting directly with its atmosphere and instead creating its own region, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma very different from that of the solar wind. The magnetosphere of Saturn is the second–largest magnetosphere in the Solar System after that of Jupiter.\n\nAs with Earth's magnetosphere, the boundary separating the solar wind's plasma from that within Saturn's magnetosphere is called the magnetopause. The magnetopause distance from the planet's center at the subsolar point varies widely from 16 to 27 R (R=60,330 km is the equatorial radius of Saturn). The magnetopause's position depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. The average magnetopause standoff distance is about 22 R. In front of the magnetopause (at the distance of about 27 R from the planet) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath.\n\nAt the opposite side of the planet, the solar wind stretches Saturn's magnetic field lines into a long, trailing magnetotail, which consists of two lobes, with the magnetic field in the northern lobe pointing away from Saturn and the southern pointing towards it. The lobes are separated by a thin layer of plasma called the tail current sheet. Like Earth’s, Saturn's tail is a channel through which solar plasma enters the inner regions of the magnetosphere. Similar to Jupiter, the tail is the conduit through which the plasma of the internal magnetospheric origin leaves the magnetosphere. The plasma moving from the tail to the inner magnetosphere is heated and forms a number of radiation belts.\n\nSaturn's magnetosphere is often divided into four regions. The innermost region co-located with Saturn's planetary rings, inside approximately 3 R, has a strictly dipolar magnetic field. It is largely devoid of plasma, which is absorbed by ring particles, although the radiation belts of Saturn are located in this innermost region just inside and outside the rings. The second region between 3 and 6 R contains the cold plasma torus and is called the inner magnetosphere. It contains the densest plasma in the saturnian system. The plasma in the torus originates from the inner icy moons and particularly from Enceladus. The magnetic field in this region is also mostly dipolar. The third region lies between 6 and 12–14 R and is called the dynamic and extended plasma sheet. The magnetic field in this region is stretched and non-dipolar, whereas the plasma is confined to a thin equatorial plasma sheet. The fourth outermost region is located beyond 15 R at high latitudes and continues up to magnetopause boundary. It is characterized by a low plasma density and a variable, non-dipolar magnetic field strongly influenced by the Solar wind.\n\nIn the outer parts of Saturn's magnetosphere beyond approximately 15–20 R the magnetic field near the equatorial plane is highly stretched and forms a disk-like structure called \"magnetodisk\". The disk continues up to the magnetopause on the dayside and transitions into the magnetotail on the nightside. Near the dayside it can be absent when the magnetosphere is compressed by the Solar wind, which usually happens when the magnetopause distance is smaller than 23 R. On the nightside and flanks of the magnetosphere the magnetodisk is always present. The Saturn's magnetodisk is a much smaller analog of the Jovian magnetodisk.\n\nThe plasma sheet in the Saturn's magnetosphere has a bowl-like shape not found in any other known magnetosphere. When Cassini arrived in 2004, there was a winter in the northern hemisphere. The measurements of the magnetic field and plasma density revealed that the plasma sheet was warped and lay to the north of the equatorial plane looking like a giant bowl. Such a shape was unexpected.\n\nThe processes driving Saturn's magnetosphere are similar to those driving Earth's and Jupiter's. Just as Jupiter's magnetosphere is dominated by plasma co–rotation and mass–loading from Io, so Saturn's magnetosphere is dominated by plasma co–rotation and mass–loading from Enceladus. However, Saturn's magnetosphere is much smaller in size, while its inner region contains too little plasma to seriously distend it and create a large magnetodisk. This means that it is much more strongly influenced by the solar wind, and that, like Earth's magnetic field, its dynamics are affected by reconnection with the wind similar to the Dungey cycle.\n\nAnother distinguishing feature of Saturn's magnetosphere is high abundance of neutral gas around the planet. As revealed by ultraviolet observation of Cassini, the planet is enshrouded in a large cloud of hydrogen, water vapor and their dissociative products like hydroxyl, extending as far as 45 R from Saturn. In the inner magnetosphere the ratio of neutrals to ions is around 60 and it increases in the outer magnetosphere, which means that the entire magnetospheric volume is filled with relatively dense weakly ionized gas. This is different, for instance, from Jupiter or Earth, where ions dominate over neutral gas, and has consequences for the magnetospheric dynamics.\n\nThe plasma composition in Saturn's inner magnetosphere is dominated by the water group ions: O, HO, OH and others, hydronium ion (HO), HO and O, although protons and nitrogen ions (N) are also present. The main source of water is Enceladus, which releases 300–600 kg/s of water vapor from the geysers near its south pole. The released water and hydroxyl (OH) radicals (a product of water's dissociation) form a rather thick torus around the moon's orbit at 4 R with densities up to 10,000 molecules per cubic centimeter. At least 100 kg/s of this water is eventually ionized and added to the co–rotating magnetospheric plasma. Additional sources of water group ions are Saturn's rings and other icy moons. The Cassini spacecraft also observed small amounts of N ions in the inner magnetosphere, which probably originate from Enceladus as well.\n\nIn the outer parts of the magnetosphere the dominant ions are protons, which originate either from the Solar wind or Saturn's ionosphere. Titan, which orbits close to the magnetopause boundary at 20 R, is not a significant source of plasma.\n\nThe relatively cold plasma in the innermost region of Saturn's magnetosphere, inside 3 R (near the rings) consists mainly of O and O ions. There ions together with electrons form an ionosphere surrounding the saturnian rings.\n\nFor both Jupiter and Saturn, transport of plasma from the inner to the outer parts of the magnetosphere is thought to be related to interchange instability. In the case of Saturn, magnetic flux tubes loaded with cold, water–rich plasma interchange with flux tubes filled with hot plasma arriving from the outer magnetosphere. The instability is driven by centrifugal force exerted by the plasma on the magnetic field. The cold plasma is eventually removed from the magnetosphere by plasmoids formed when the magnetic field reconnects in the magnetotail. The plasmoids move down the tail and escape from the magnetosphere. The reconnection or substorm process is thought to be under the control of the solar wind and Saturn's largest moon Titan, which orbits near the outer boundary of the magnetosphere.\n\nIn the magnetodisk region, beyond 6 R, the plasma within the co–rotating sheet exerts a significant centrifugal force on the magnetic field, causing it to stretch. This interaction creates a current in the equatorial plane flowing azimuthally with rotation and extending as far as 20 R from the planet. The total strength of this current varies from 8 to 17 MA. The ring current in the saturnian magnetosphere is highly variable and depends of the solar wind pressure, being stronger when the pressure is weaker. The magnetic moment associated with this current slightly (by about 10 nT) depresses the magnetic field in the inner magnetosphere, although it increases the total magnetic moment of the planet and causing the size of the magnetosphere to become larger.\n\nSaturn has bright polar aurorae, which have been observed in the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared light. The aurorae usually look like bright continuous circles (ovals) surrounding the poles of the planet. The latitude of auroral ovals varies in the range of 70–80°; the average position is for the southern aurora, while the northern aurora is closer to the pole by about 1.5°. From time to time either aurorae can assume a spiral shape instead of oval. In this case it begins near midnight at a latitude of around 80°, then its latitude decreases to as low as 70° as it continues into the dawn and day sectors (counterclockwise). In the dusk sector the auroral latitude increases again, although when it returns to the night sector it still has a relatively low latitude and does not connect to the brighter dawn part.\n\nUnlike Jupiter's, the Saturn's main auroral ovals are not related to the breakdown of the co–rotation of the plasma in the outer parts of the planet's magnetosphere. The aurorae on Saturn are thought to be connected to the reconnection of the magnetic field under the influence of the Solar wind (Dungey cycle), which drives an upward current (about 10 million amperes) from the ionosphere and leads to the acceleration and precipitation of energetic (1–10 keV) electrons into the polar thermosphere of Saturn. The saturnian aurorae are more similar to those of the Earth, where they are also Solar wind driven. The ovals themselves correspond to the boundaries between open and closed magnetic field lines—so called polar caps, which are thought to reside at the distance of 10–15° from the poles.\n\nThe aurorae of Saturn are highly variable. Their location and brightness strongly depends on the Solar wind pressure: the aurorae become brighter and move closer to the poles when the Solar wind pressure increases. The bright auroral features are observed to rotate with the angular speed of 60–75% that of Saturn. From time to time bright features appear in the dawn sector of the main oval or inside it. The average total power emitted by the aurorae is about 50 GW in the far ultraviolet (80–170 nm) and 150–300 GW in the near-infrared (3–4 μm—H emissions) parts of the spectrum.\n\nSaturn is the source of rather strong low frequency radio emissions called Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR). The frequency of SKR lies in the range 10–1300 kHz (wavelength of a few kilometers) with the maximum around 400 kHz. The power of these emissions is strongly modulated by the rotation of the planet and is correlated with changes in the solar wind pressure. For instance, when Saturn was immersed into the giant magnetotail of Jupiter during Voyager 2 flyby in 1981, the SKR power decreased greatly or even ceased completely. The kilometric radiation is thought to be generated by the Cyclotron Maser Instability of the electrons moving along magnetic field lines related to the auroral regions of Saturn. Thus the SKR is related to the auroras around the poles of the planet. The radiation itself comprises spectrally diffuse emissions as well as narrowband tones with bandwidths as narrow as 200 Hz. In the frequency–time plane arc like features are often observed, much like in the case of the Jovian kilometric radiation. The total power of the SKR is around 1 GW.\n\nThe modulation of the radio emissions by planetary rotation is traditionally used to determine the rotation period of the interiors of fluid giant planets. In the case of Saturn, however, this appears to be impossible, as the period varies at the timescale of tens years. In 1980–1981 the periodicity in the radio emissions as measured by Voyager 1 and 2 was , which was then adopted as the rotational period of Saturn. Scientists were surprised when Galileo and then Cassini returned a different value—. Further observation indicated that the modulation period changes by as much as 1% on the characteristic timescale of 20–30 days with an additional long term trend. There is a correlation between the period and solar wind speed, however, the causes of this change remain a mystery. One reason may be that the saturnian perfectly axially symmetric magnetic field fails to impose a strict corotation on the magnetospheric plasma making it slip relative to the planet. The lack of a precise correlation between the variation period of SKR and planetary rotation makes it all but impossible to determine the true rotational period of Saturn.\n\nSaturn has relatively weak radiation belts, because energetic particles are absorbed by the moons and particulate material orbiting the planet. The densest (main) radiation belt lies between the inner edge of the Enceladus gas torus at 3.5 R and the outer edge of the A Ring at 2.3 R. It contains protons and relativistic electrons with energies from hundreds of kiloelectronvolts (keV) to as high as tens of megaelectronvolts (MeV) and possibly other ions. Beyond 3.5 R the energetic particles are absorbed by the neutral gas and their numbers drop, although less energetic particles with energies in the range of hundreds keV appear again beyond 6 R—these are the same particles that contribute to the ring current. The electrons in the main belt probably originate in the outer magnetosphere or Solar wind, from which they are transported by the diffusion and then adiabatically heated. However, the energetic protons consist of two populations of particles. The first population with energies of less than about 10 MeV has the same origin as electrons, while the second one with the maximum flux near 20 MeV results from the interaction of cosmic rays with solid material present in the Saturnian system (so called cosmic ray albedo neutron decay process—CRAND). The main radiation belt of Saturn is strongly influenced by interplanetary solar wind disturbances.\n\nThe innermost region of the magnetosphere near the rings is generally devoid of energetic ions and electrons because they are absorbed by ring particles. Saturn, however, has the second radiation belt discovered by Cassini in 2004 and located just inside the innermost D Ring. This belt probably consists of energetic charged particles formed via the CRAND process or of ionized energetic neutral atoms coming from the main radiation belt.\n\nThe saturnian radiation belts are generally much weaker than those of Jupiter and do not emit much microwave radiation (with frequency of a few Gigahertz). Estimates shows that their decimetric radio emissions (DIM) would be impossible to detect from the Earth. Nevertherless the high energy particles cause weathering of the surfaces of the icy moons and sputter water, water products and oxygen from them.\n\nThe abundant population of solid bodies orbiting Saturn including moons as well as ring particles exerts a strong influence on the magnetosphere of Saturn. The plasma in the magnetosphere co-rotates with the planet, continuously impinging on the trailing hemispheres of slowly moving moons. While ring particles and the majority of moons only passively absorb plasma and energetic charged particles, three moons – Enceladus, Dione and Titan – are significant sources of new plasma. The absorption of energetic electrons and ions reveals itself by noticeable gaps in the radiation belts of Saturn near the moon's orbits, while the dense rings of Saturn completely eliminate all energetic electrons and ions closer than 2.2 R, creating a low radiation zone in the vicinity of the planet. The absorption of the co-rotating plasma by a moon disturbs the magnetic field in its empty wake—the field is pulled towards a moon, creating a region of a stronger magnetic field in the near wake.\n\nThe three moons mentioned above add new plasma into the magnetosphere. By far the strongest source is Enceladus, which ejects a fountain of water vapor, carbon dioxide and nitrogen through cracks in its south pole region. A fraction of this gas is ionized by the hot electrons and solar ultraviolet radiation and is added to the co-rotational plasma flow. Titan once was thought to be the principal source of plasma in Saturn's magnetosphere, especially of nitrogen. The new data obtained by Cassini in 2004–2008 established that it is not a significant source of nitrogen after all, although it may still provide significant amounts of hydrogen (due to dissociation of methane). Dione is the third moon producing more new plasma than it absorbs. The mass of plasma created in the vicinity of it (about 6 g/s) is about 1/300 as much as near Enceladus. However, even this low value can not be explained only by sputtering of its icy surface by energetic particles, which may indicate that Dione is endogenously active like Enceladus. The moons that create new plasma slow the motion of the co-rotating plasma in their vicinity, which leads to the pile-up of the magnetic field lines in front of them and weakening of the field in their wakes—the field drapes around them. This is the opposite to what is observed for the plasma-absorbing moons.\n\nThe plasma and energetic particles present in the magnetosphere of Saturn, when absorbed by ring particles and moons, cause radiolysis of the water ice. Its products include ozone, hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. The first one has been detected in the surfaces of Rhea and Dione, while the second is thought to be responsible for the steep spectral slopes of moons' reflectivities in the ultraviolet region. The oxygen produced by radiolysis forms tenuous atmospheres around rings and icy moons. The ring atmosphere was detected by Cassini for the first time in 2004. A fraction of the oxygen gets ionized, creating a small population of O ions in the magnetosphere. The influence of Saturn's magnetosphere on its moons is more subtle than the influence of Jupiter on its moons. In the latter case, the magnetosphere contains a significant number of sulfur ions, which, when implanted in surfaces, produce characteristic spectral signatures. In the case of Saturn, the radiation levels are much lower and the plasma is composed mainly of water products, which, when implanted, are indistinguishable from the ice already present.\n\nAs of 2014 the magnetosphere of Saturn has been directly explored by four spacecraft. The first mission to study the magnetosphere was Pioneer 11 in September 1979. Pioneer 11 discovered the magnetic field and made some measurements of the plasma parameters. In November 1980 and August 1981, Voyager 1–2 probes investigated the magnetosphere using an improved set of instruments. From the fly-by trajectories they measured the planetary magnetic field, plasma composition and density, high energy particle energy and spatial distribution, plasma waves and radio emissions. Cassini spacecraft was launched in 1997, and arrived in 2004, making the first measurements in more than two decades. The spacecraft continued to provide information about the magnetic field and plasma parameters of the saturnian magnetosphere until its intentional destruction on September 15, 2017.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Ulysses spacecraft conducted extensive measurements of the Saturnian kilometric radiation (SKR), which is unobservable from Earth due to the absorption in the ionosphere. The SKR is powerful enough to be detected from a spacecraft at the distance of several astronomical units from the planet. Ulysses discovered that the period of the SKR varies by as much as 1%, and therefore is not directly related to the rotation period of the interior of Saturn.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2309443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309443", "title": "Not Guilty (song)", "text": "Not Guilty (song)\n\n\"Not Guilty\" is a song by English rock musician George Harrison from his 1979 album \"George Harrison\". He wrote the song in 1968 following the Beatles' Transcendental Meditation course in India with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an activity that he had led the group in undertaking. The lyrics refer to Harrison's relationship with his bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney in the aftermath to their falling out with the Maharishi and as the Beatles launched their multimedia company Apple Corps. The band spent several days recording the song amid the tensions that characterised the sessions for their 1968 double album \"The Beatles\" (also known as the \"White Album\"). The track was completed in August 1968 but not included on the release.\n\nHarrison revisited \"Not Guilty\" in 1978 during the sessions for his self-titled album. In contrast to the atmosphere surrounding the song's creation, this period was one of personal contentment for Harrison, whose participation in the Rutles' pastiche of the Beatles' history, \"All You Need Is Cash\", had encouraged him to feel more comfortable with his former band's legacy. The song's arrangement similarly differs in mood from the 1968 version and reflects Harrison's adoption of a mellow jazz style. The musicians on the recording include Neil Larsen and Willie Weeks.\n\nThrough much of the 1970s, the Beatles' version was the subject of speculation among collectors of the band's unofficial recordings. This performance, featuring distorted electric guitar and harpsichord, remained unreleased until 1996, when it was included on the \"Anthology 3\" outtakes compilation.\n\nGeorge Harrison wrote \"Not Guilty\" in 1968 following the Beatles' Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. As the Beatle who had been most interested in attending teacher Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's course, Harrison felt responsible for his bandmates' experience there. Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney had each left the ashram early and returned to England, while Harrison and John Lennon stayed on, only to then depart hurriedly after hearing of alleged impropriety between the Maharishi and a female student. In an interview with \"Billboard\" editor Timothy White in 1999, Harrison referred to \"the grief I was catching\" from Lennon and McCartney post-India, and explained the message behind the song: \"I said I wasn't guilty of getting in the way of their career. I said I wasn't guilty of leading them astray in our going to Rishikesh to see the Maharishi. I was sticking up for myself …\"\n\nRather than return to England immediately, where the Beatles were planning the launch of their Apple record label, Harrison had extended his time away by visiting his mentor Ravi Shankar in Madras. When he returned to London in late April 1968, according to Apple executive Derek Taylor, Harrison \"reacted with real horror\" at the lavishness of Apple's campaign. Reflecting the idealism behind the company, Apple Corps had taken out print advertisements inviting any budding artist to submit their creative ideas. The London offices were inundated with submissions, almost all of which were ignored, along with crowds of eccentrics responding to the Beatles' invitation. In \"Not Guilty\", the line \"I won't upset the Apple cart\" was a deliberate reference to the company, while \"making friends with every Sikh\" referred to activities with the Maharishi.<ref name=\"Brown/RS\"></ref> In his 1980 autobiography, \"I, Me, Mine\", Harrison says that the lyrics address \"Paul-John-Apple-Rishikesh-Indian friends, etc.\"\n\nMusicologist Walter Everett describes the song's lyrics as Harrison's \"defense against the tyranny of his songwriting comrades\". He highlights its musical form as an example of \"the composer's typically outlandish chord juxtapositions\" and, in the Beatles' studio recording, of McCartney's inventive and melodic bass lines.\n\nAn acoustic demo of the song was recorded during May 1968 at Harrison's home, Kinfauns in Esher, in preparation for what became the album \"The Beatles\", also known as the \"White Album\". On the tapes, the song follows a group performance of Harrison's tribute to meditation, \"Sour Milk Sea\", after which he refers to \"Not Guilty\" as \"a jazz number\" that would make \"a good rocker\". This version, previously available on numerous bootlegs, was eventually issued in 2018 on the White Album's 50th Anniversary box set.\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"Not Guilty\" in August 1968 during sessions for the White Album. The recording was produced by George Martin and engineered by Ken Scott. The song as presented to the group was difficult to learn due to its time signature changes, and during the first 18 takes on 7 August they focused only on the introduction; after a further 27 takes, recording was abandoned until the next day. The sessions eventually ran to 99 takes, many of which were incomplete performances. Initial takes featured keyboard accompaniment from an electric piano, but this was replaced by a harpsichord that was installed in Abbey Road Studio 1. The recording marked the first time that Harrison used his Gibson Les Paul guitar known as \"Lucy\", which was a gift from his friend Eric Clapton.\n\nThe band returned to the track on 9 August, with a six-and-a-half-hour session dedicated to Harrison's lead guitar overdubs. During the session, he sat in the control room playing his guitar, while the amplifier was recorded from an echo chamber. On 12 August, Harrison overdubbed his lead vocal, trying different areas of the studio in an effort to achieve the sound he was after. He again settled on the control room with, in Scott's description, \"everything coming back through the speakers to give it more of a live theater-type feel or club feel\". Lennon and McCartney experimented with harmony vocals on some parts of the song, but Harrison remained unsatisfied. After more attempts to record guitar at live performance levels that day, the song was abandoned. A mono mix, titled RM1, of the completed track was carried out. Without warning, Harrison then departed for a short holiday in Greece, which led to the cancellation of the Beatles' 19 August session. Ian MacDonald views this sudden departure as a protest by Harrison against his bandmates' apparent indifference towards \"Not Guilty\". Scott told journalist Marshall Terrill in 2012 that the recording was problematic because \"George wasn't feeling it. It was his song and he wasn't feeling it. He could not get a vocal that he was happy with. He couldn't get even into sort of the mood of singing it, that's why we tried different ways of him singing it …\"<ref name=\"Terrill/DT\"></ref>\n\nThe remaining Beatles resumed recording on 20 August with tensions running high, as Lennon and Starr worked in one studio and McCartney recorded alone in another. Two days later, by which point Harrison had returned to London, the acrimony that had been building within the group led to Starr walking out, intent on quitting the Beatles.\n\nAccording to Everett, the song was one of the last to be cut from the final running order of \"The Beatles\". Although Lennon admired the composition initially, author Simon Leng considers that, with its \"barbs about the Beatles\", the song \"was just a little too candid in airing the band's dirty laundry\". Music journalist Mikal Gilmore similarly says that its exclusion was \"perhaps because it was apparent to everybody that Harrison had aimed the song at Lennon and McCartney\".\n\nFollowing his pioneering backwards-recorded guitar solo on \"I'm Only Sleeping\", in 1966, Harrison's use of reverse echo-chamber effect on \"Not Guilty\" marked the last example of the Beatles using backwards audio on one of their recordings. In its three-part study of the 1968 double album, in 2008, \"Goldmine\" magazine commented that the song's exclusion has long been one of the points of debate regarding the White Album, with some listeners finding the content of the set \"exquisitely balanced\", while others contend that the Beatles \"really should have added 'Not Guilty' to the brew\". With reference to Martin's stated wish that \"The Beatles\" had been edited down to a single LP, Everett offers a 15-song running order in keeping with the producer's typical \"preferences and constraints\", in which he contends that Martin would have selected \"Not Guilty\", along with the Harrison compositions \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Long, Long, Long\".\n\nThe final take, numbered 102 (a reduction mix of take 99), was edited and remixed by Geoff Emerick in 1984 for the aborted \"Sessions\" album. It was leaked to the \"Ultra Rare Trax\" Volume 3 bootleg in the late 1980s, and eventually released officially in October 1996 on \"Anthology 3\". Author and critic Richie Unterberger describes the \"Anthology 3\" version of \"Not Guilty\" as a \"bastardization\" due to the editing out of a mid-song guitar solo and other features from the 1968 stereo mix. He adds that this treatment is \"more roundly castigated than almost any other of the \"Anthology\" reconstructions\". Beatles author John Winn also criticises Emerick's work, describing it as a \"mangled mix\" with inconsistent sound and several \"superfluous edits\". Take 102 without Emerick's edits appears on the 50th Anniversary box set.\n\nAccording to author Robert Rodriguez, \"Not Guilty\" was \"much-fabled\" among Beatles fans by the late 1970s, since the song was known as a White Album outtake but had never been heard publicly. In their respective books on the Beatles published at that time, Nicholas Schaffner paired it with Lennon's \"What's the New Mary Jane\" as completed recordings that were known to have been left off the White Album, while Harry Castleman and Walter Podrazik wrote that, as far as collectors were aware, Harrison had taped \"Not Guilty\" with Clapton in summer 1968 before the Beatles attempted to record the song in March 1969.\nIn early 1978, while gathering song manuscripts for his autobiography, \"I, Me, Mine\", Harrison rediscovered his Kinfauns demo of \"Not Guilty\". He decided to record the song again, in March 1978, during sessions for his 1979 album \"George Harrison\". The sessions coincided with a period of domestic contentment for Harrison, during which he married his partner Olivia Arias and become a father for the first time, to son Dhani. In addition, Harrison had enjoyed participating in the Rutles' spoof of the Beatles' history, \"All You Need Is Cash\", a film project that allowed him to debunk the myths that surrounded his former band. Leng views Harrison's remake of \"Not Guilty\" as typical of the singer's frame of mind on \"George Harrison\", writing: \"In complete contrast [to the Beatles' version], the 1979 reproduction is all shimmering cool and acoustic sea spray – here is a man looking back on events rather than being caught up in their heat.\" Harrison dropped a section of 3/8 time that had been one of the factors in making the 1968 recording difficult.\n\nHarrison recorded the song at his home studio in Henley, Oxfordshire, with Stevie Winwood, Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark among the backing musicians. Neil Larsen played Rhodes piano on the song. Leng describes the musical mood on the track as \"a loose version of the Rickie Lee Jones or Paul Simon jazz-pop sound, dominated by phased electric piano and breathy vocals\".\n\n\"George Harrison\" received favourable reviews, particularly in the UK, where it was his best-received work since the early 1970s. Harry George of the \"NME\" welcomed the inclusion of \"Not Guilty\", saying that \"No Beatle who could take part in \"All You Need Is Cash\" can be all bad\". He described the song as a \"tense soft-shoe shuffle\" in which Harrison's lyrics offered \"wit and composure\". Former \"Record Collector\" editor Peter Doggett writes that, in the context of its delayed release, eleven years after the events of 1968, the song \"gently satirised the global obsession with the past, and specifically the era that the Beatles allegedly epitomised\".\n\nAccording to Walter Everett:\n\nAccording to Simon Leng:\n\n"}

The film was written by Jeff Schechter and directed by Greg Beeman. The film stars Erik von Detten as Andy \"Brink\" Brinker, a high school inline skater who joins a group of sponsored aggressive inline skaters to earn money to help his financially troubled family. The film is considered a modern and loosely based adaptation of Mary Mapes Dodge's 1865 novel \"Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates\".\n\nAndy \"Brink\" Brinker and his in-line skating crew—Peter, Jordy, and Gabriella—who call themselves \"Soul-Skaters\" (they skate for the fun of it, not for the money), clash with a group of sponsored skaters, Team X-Bladz—led by Val—with whom they attend high school in southern California.\n\nOn the first day of school, the Soul-Skaters and Team X-Bladz race on school grounds. Boomer, a skater for Team X-Bladz, is seriously injured during the race, while Brink and Val are both caught and suspended. Brink learns that his family is in financial trouble; his father, Ralph, has been on disability for six months. Brink secretly goes against what he believes and joins Team X-Bladz for $200 a week, as a replacement for Boomer. Ralph gets him a part-time job at Pup-N-Suds, a dog grooming business. This, however, is a job which Jordy, Gabriella, and Peter are aware of because Brink had told them that he's working there. For a while, Brink manages to keep his other job in Team X-Bladz a secret from his family and friends by assuming different costumes. However, Jordy, Gabriella, and Peter discover the truth when they catch him skating for Team X-Bladz to at an invitational prior to an upcoming local competition. Brink's friends feel he betrayed them and choose to ignore him upon discovering his alignment with Team X-Bladz.\n\nBrink tries to rejoin the Soul Skaters, but is rebuffed. Val offers Brink a chance to re-join X-Bladz by noting the team won't hold him leaving against him. While scouting the route for the downhill leg of the upcoming competition, The Soul-Skaters and Team X-Bladz agree to a downhill race, with Gabriella against Brink. During the race, Val sabotages the course by tossing gravel onto the road - but tells Brink to take a different route. Gabriella wipes out big and sustains cuts and bruises. At this point, all of the Soul-Skaters disown Brink as their friend; they call him a sell-out and stop talking to him. \n\nBrink visits Gabriella at her house and she calls him a sell-out. Ralph learns about the accident and Brink's position on Team X-Bladz from Gabriella's mother. In the garage, he has a heart-to-heart with Brink and asks him why he didn't tell the family about it. Brink finally confesses his true reasons for joining Team X-Bladz and wanting to be a somebody from it. He admits that though he got what he wanted, it has gotten him into a mess. Brink mentions he has lost his friends and doesn't have fun skating with X-Bladz. Ralph reveals that although the family is in financial trouble, Brink should not be skating for the money and would rather skate for fun.\n\nInspired by his father, Brink confronts Val at the local boardwalk, quits Team X-Bladz, and returns the team gear (skates / helmet). Val tells Brink to not renege on his contractual obligations with Team X-Bladz. This leads to a heated argument between both boys and Brink to toss a milkshake in Val's face.\n\nIn the days before the competition, Brink meets his friends at the skate yard. After giving them new skates, Brink tells them of his plan to sponsor the team under the name \"Team Pup 'N Suds\". When questioned, Brink admits he got an advance from PupNSuds from his wages to pay for the skates. They forgive Brink and accept him as their friend again.\n\nAs friends once again, they compete in the competition with their families' support. In the end, it comes down to Brink and Val in the championship race. Throughout the downhill championship, Val continually attempts to shove Brink off the course. When Val crashes off the course, Brink returns to help him up. Val yanks Brink to the ground to try to get a head start, while ESPN cameras stream the interaction to onlookers. After getting up, with Val in the lead, Brink takes a shortcut to win the race.\n\nImmediately after the race, while Val is disqualified and storms off, Team X-Bladz manager, Jimmy, who saw Val's cheating and kicked him off the team, offers Brink a spot on Team X-Bladz. However, Brink declines. He happily re-joins the Soul Skaters and receives the trophy.\n\n\nOriginal music composed by J. Peter Robinson, additional music by Phil Marshall\n\nIn 2012, \"Complex\" ranked the film at number 1 on the magazine's list of the 25 best Disney Channel Original Movies. In December 2015, Dylan Kickham of \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked \"Brink!\" at number four on a list of the top 30 DCOMs. Kickham wrote, \"Along with the hilariously nostalgic lingo, \"Brink!\" earns its place in the pantheon of great DCOMs for mixing adrenaline, drama, and one-time Disney golden boy Erik von Detten.\" In March 2016, the film was ranked at number 37 on MTV's list of the best DCOMs, consisting of 99 films. In May 2016, Aubrey Page of Collider ranked each Disney Channel Original Movie released up to that point. Page ranked \"Brink!\" at number 17, writing, \"It's been official pretty much since it aired: \"Brink!\" is a classic. And, it's potentially the best aggressive inline skating movie ever been committed to film – though it might also be the only one.\"\n"}
{"id": "2309460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309460", "title": "Montana Freemen", "text": "Montana Freemen\n\nThe Montana Freemen were an anti-government militant \"Christian Patriot movement\" based outside the town of Jordan, Montana, in the United States. The members of the group referred to their land as \"Justus Township\" and had declared themselves no longer under the authority of any outside government. They became the center of public attention in 1996 when they engaged in a prolonged armed standoff with agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe Montana Freemen espoused belief in the doctrine of individual sovereignty and rejected the authority of the federal government of the United States. On March 2, 1995, William Stanton, a Garfield County rancher, became the first Montana resident ever convicted of terrorism; District Judge Kenneth Wilson sentenced Stanton to 10 years in prison (the maximum penalty) for using violence for political ends. The following day, four armed men who styled themselves the \"Garfield County Freemen\" were arrested when they entered the Musselshell County Courthouse and tried to file papers protesting the seizure of Rodney Skurdal's house by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe Freemen, led by LeRoy M. Schweitzer, used \"inter alia\" \"Anderson on the Uniform Commercial Code\" and \"Bankers Handbook\" to draw notices of lien against public officials. The liens were then allegedly sold to generate equity to fund an effort to make a \"firm offer to pay off the national debt.\" The Freemen claimed that the liens conformed to the Uniform Commercial Code and that their township's court had an interest in a tort claim for damages incurred by the named public officials for violations of their oaths of office. They also claimed that support of the corporate credit system was an unconstitutional and corrupt act which has throughout the last half of the twentieth century \"...[deprived the majority of Americans] of their property until [their] posterity wakes up homeless...\", a paraphrased quotation attributed to Thomas Jefferson.\n\nThe Freemen were known to produce their own very realistic counterfeit checks and money orders, sometimes ordering items and deliberately overpaying so they could demand refunds. The president of one bank reported that over an 18-month period his bank received two to five complaints a week about Freemen checks. In 1995, members wrote a fraudulent check to try to purchase $1.4 million worth of firearms, ammunition, and bulletproof vests.\n\nIn late 1994, foreclosure proceedings were initiated against the farm that contained Justus Township. The Freemen refused to be evicted from the land. They had also conducted their own mock trials of numerous public officials, and issued their own writ of execution against a federal judge. The FBI investigated the group and initiated a sting operation aimed at one of the Freemen's financial programs, which led to the arrest of two members of the group in March 1996. The FBI also had warrants for eight other persons suspected to be in the farm, but before they were able to arrest them an armed confrontation developed and the FBI withdrew to a safe distance to avoid violence. The similar 1993 standoff in Waco, Texas involving the Branch Davidians, as well as the 1992 incident between the Weaver family and the FBI at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, were still fresh in the public mind, and the FBI was extremely cautious and wanted to prevent a recurrence of those violent events. After 81 days of negotiations, the Freemen surrendered to authorities on June 14, 1996.\n\nLeRoy Schweitzer was convicted of conspiracy, bank fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, false claims to the IRS, interstate transportation of stolen property, threats against public officials, armed robbery of a television news crew, and firearms violations. He received a 22-year sentence for 25 convictions in a South Carolina federal prison. After Ervin Elbert Hurlbert and Donald Little, who identified themselves as \"Montana Marshals\", attempted to free Schweitzer from the prison, he was moved to the Administrative Maximum (ADX) facility at the Florence Federal Correctional Complex at Florence, Colorado, in 2006. Schweitzer died, aged 73, in ADX Florence on September 20, 2011.\n\n\nOn April 7, 2008, Russell Dean Landers had his sentence extended by 15 years for attempting to extort his release from prison. He and two other inmates at the federal prison in El Reno, Oklahoma had demanded millions of dollars from officials for the use of their names, which they claimed were \"copyrighted\". They were found guilty of \"conspiring to impede the duties of federal prison officials and extortion in (their) efforts to gain release from prison by making financial demands on prison staff and attempting to seize their property.\"\n\nOn April 6, 2010, Daniel E. Petersen was sentenced to additional time for filing bogus liens from prison against three federal judges. One of the judges targeted was the judge who sentenced Petersen to prison originally. Petersen was sentenced in 1996 to 15 years. He was convicted on 19 of 20 counts, which included bank fraud and armed robbery. While serving his sentence in a federal prison in Minnesota, Petersen devised a scheme in which to retaliate against three judges in his case. Federal prosecutors, after investigating, found that Petersen invented a company that supposedly held assets that included a $100 trillion default judgment against the United States. He then sold \"shares\" of the phony company to fellow inmates and others. He claimed these shares were backed by \"redemption certificates\" to be redeemed when the judgment was collected. The judgment he referred to came from a self-created court, after former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declined to respond to his demands. He was demanding $100 trillion, as well as $1 billion per day in interest for unlawfully confining him. Petersen followed up by filing liens against property owned by the three federal judges, as well as by offering bounties for the arrest of the same judges. The purpose was to entice someone to bring the three judges to Minnesota in order to respond to his liens.\n\nScott Roeder, convicted for the 2009 murder of physician and abortion provider George Tiller, was also reportedly involved with the Freemen.\n\nA 2011 National Public Radio report claimed that some of the people associated with the Montana Freemen were imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit.\n\n\n"}

The three primary islands, of approximately equal size, are Pini, Tanahmasa, and Tanahbala. There are forty-eight smaller islands, of which the largest are Sipika, Simuk, Bodjo, Telo and Sigata; less than half are inhabited. The total land area of the seven administrative districts is 1,206.6 km. The islands are governed as a part of South Nias regency within North Sumatra province. In Indonesian and Malay, \"batu\" means \"rock\" or \"stone\".\n\nThe equator passes through the archipelago, north of Tanahmasa and south of Pini. Administratively, Pini (with offshore islets) forms the Pulau-pulau Batu Timur (East Batu Islands) District of South Nias Regency. The rest of the archipelago at the 2010 Census comprised the Pulau-pulau Batu (Batu Islands) and Hibala Districts of the same regency. However, both have been subsequently divided to form new Districts - Tana Masa District has been formed from part of Hibala District, and three new districts have been formed from parts of Pulau-pulau Batu District - namely Pulau-pulau Batu Barat (West Batu Islands), Pulau-pulau Batu Utara (North Batu Islands) and Simuk Districts. The original districts remain with reduced areas and population, and thus the islands now form seven separate districts.\n\nThe people of the Batu Islands have had substantial interaction with the populations of Nias, to the north, whose language they share. The islands have occasionally been a destination for slaves who escaped from Nias, and in the past decade have become a destination for surfing boat charters from Padang, on the Sumatran mainland.

{"id": "2309482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309482", "title": "Westend (Frankfurt am Main)", "text": "Westend (Frankfurt am Main)\n\nWestend-Nord and Westend-Süd are two city districts of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The division into a northern and a southern part is mostly for administrative purposes as the Westend is generally considered an entity. Both city districts are part of the \"Ortsbezirk Innenstadt II\".\n\nThe Westend with its Wilhelminian style buildings is a beloved residential quarter and has the highest real estate prices in Frankfurt. Many old villas serve as offices for law firms and companies of the financial community. Along with the Bahnhofsviertel, the Nordend and the Ostend, it is part of Frankfurt's dense inner city districts.\n\nLike the other districts constructed in the Wilhelminian period the Westend has been within the town walls of Frankfurt since the building of the \"Frankfurter Landwehr\" . Largely consisting of fields and heathland, it was area made up of isolated farming estates. Streets in the area still carry the names of these estates which were called Hellerhof, Hynsperghof and Kettenhof.\n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century the old Frankfurt fortifications were razed. Soon numerous classic suburban villas with generous gardens sprang up along the Bockenheimer Landstraße, the arterial road in the neighbouring town of Bockenheim. Among them were the Gontardsche garden house and the Villa Leonhardi designed by the architect Nicolas Alexandre Salins de Montfort, as well as the Rothschildpalais of Friedrich Rumpf. Around the middle of the nineteenth century the area through the town was divided up and the streets and Squares were laid out. The narrow, built-up Frankfurter Neustadt was bursting at the seams and so people were continuously moving to the outer western town. Paris became an archetype for street construction, therefore wide boulevards as well as squares with radial streets leading outwards began to appear.\nIn 1858 the first Frankfurt Zoo was laid out on the Bockenheimer Landstraße, which was later moved to the Ostend. The Westend then became a residential quarter for the affluent, as in other towns and cities with a Westend. Many villas and grand residential houses sprouted, of which many still stand today. At the end of the nineteenth century nearly the whole southern part of the Westend was built-up. In the northern part was the newly laid Palmengarten, the Grüneburgweg with its emerging Grüneburgpark as well as the \"Irrenanstalt\" (the so-called \"Irrenschloß\", a psychiatric hospital) founded by Heinrich Hoffmann on the Affenstein. Around the well-contained development Mayor Franz Adickes had the Alleenring built at the beginning of the twentieth century, which at the same time bound all the new boroughs of the city together.\n\nThe northern borough was less densely built-up due primarily to the generously laid borders of the Grüneburgpark. In 1930 Hans Poelzig erected the IG Farben Building. Until the Second World War nothing else changed much. In the Third Reich the borough was abolished and the Westend became part of Frankfurt-Nord. Police station nine in Lindenstraße 27 was the center of the Frankfurt Gestapo. The Westend was spared from carpet bombing during the airraids of the second world war. Initially, after the war almost the whole Westend-Nord (from Wolfgangstraße) was declared a restricted zone. The American military set up their headquarters in the I.G. Farben building. Surrounding boroughs were converted into housing estates for GIs. In 1948 barbed wire was removed from the restricted zones.\n\nIn the 1950s the Westend was still a clean residential area for around 40,000 people. The houses had only four floors as a general rule.\n\nIn 1938 Frankfurt came upon the chance to purchase a 58 hectare area between Bockenheimer Landstraße, Unterlindau, Staufenstraße and Reuterweg at a very reasonable price, which had previously belonged to the well-established Jewish Rothschild family, land which the Nazi government had put into probation. Although the 1950 selling price was later improved, the return of a third of this area was demanded to be returned as part of the Rothschild inheritance. After this, approval of the construction of a multi-storey development on the Rothschild's returned land was received (they sold it to Schweizer Zürich-Versicherung and Berliner Handelsgesellschaft) and office towers were established directly opposite the old opera house.\n\nThe Zurich building built in 1960, and demolished again soon after was the first multi-storied building in Frankfurt Westend. The city transformed the remaining part of the area into the Rothschildpark, which is accessible to everyone.\n\nAfter the abolishment of control of living space in 1960, Hans Kampffmeyer, the head of the social democratic planning department developed the concept of decentralising the inner city. The adjacent boroughs were to become an extension of the Westend. The so-called Fünf-Fingerplan of 1967 designated that through the Westend five leading axles - Mainzer Landstraße, Bockenheimer Landstraße, Reuterweg, Grüneburgweg and Eschersheimer Landstraße - should be developed under an intensive construction plan. From this came a wave of property speculation, numerous nineteenth century building were demolished in the following years, their long established tenants driven out by rough methods. Several hundred houses stood empty in the Westend of 1970, often in completely shabby condition.\n\nThe development soon encountered resistance by the population. The middle classes reacted with the creation of the first \"Bürgerinitiativen\" (citizen's initiative), the \"Aktionsgemeinschaft Westend\" (AGW). The AGW put together a land register of monuments and buildings worthy of preservation and by 1970 obtained a modification ban for Westend. Henceforward, the city wanted to turn around the development plans for any newly introduced developments. 1972 saw the federal state of Hesse issue a regulation against dwelling misuse.\n\nAt the same time the \"Frankfurter Häuserkampf\" (house squatting) developed, which was mainly driven by students at the University situated in the Westend. Many houses were occupied, which received constant supplies to demonstrate on the streets with the police. Joschka Fischer was also involved in this. The high point of the Häuserkampf was between 1970 and 1974.\n\nIn 1972 an attack on the American headquarters in the I.G Farben building was carried out by the Red Army Fraction, in which a soldier died.\n\nIn the 1970s yet another row of multi-storey buildings were built in Westend such as the AfE-Turm on the university grounds. The City-Hochhaus at Platz der Republik, in those days the highest skyscraper in Germany (and burned down in 1973 to the jubilation of several students) was however finished later.\n\nAlthough in 1976 a construction plan was decreed that no more skyscrapers would be planned, exceptions were approved in the southern part of Westend along Mainzer Landstraße and the Alleenring. Today the southern part of Westend has grown together extensively with the Bankenviertel. On the edge of Westend the second highest skyscraper in Germany, the Messeturm, rose up to 257 metres.\n\nWestend lies at the northwestern border of the inner city and north of Bahnhofsviertel and Gallus. Its longest border separated it from Bockenheim to the west. To the north the Westend meets the borough of Dornbusch, and to the east of is Nordend. The northern border of Westend is identical to that of the former Frankfurter Landwehr, which protected the territory of the free city of Frankfurt for centuries.\n\nNormally the people of Frankfurt say Westend is hemmed in by Reuterweg, the Bockenheimer Anlage at the Opernplatz, the Taunusanlage, Mainzer Landstraße up to Platz der Republik, Friedrich-Ebert-Anlage, Senckenberganlage, a small piece of Zeppelinallee, then from the southern boundary of the Palmengarten, Siesmayerstraße, Grüneburgweg up to its bend in the south east and Fürstenbergerstraße to the corner of Reuterweg.\n\nThe official urban districts of Frankfurt are not covered completely by these borders. According to these the whole Messe (fair) grounds, except in the west border area of Bockenheim and in the east of the district up to Eschersheimer Landstraße, also belongs to Westend.\n\nThe western part of the Innenstadt, the eastern part of the Bahnhofsviertel and the southern part of the Westend form Frankfurt's central business district, the Bankenviertel. The concentration of skyscrapers here is higher than anywhere else in Germany. The skyscrapers which are located in the Westend line up from the Bockenheimer Anlage via the Taunusanlage and Mainzer Landstraße to Platz der Republik. From east to west along this stretch are the Parktower (115 m), the Opernturm (170 m) the Deutsche Bank Twin Towers (each 155 m), the Trianon (186 m), the Frankfurter Büro Center (142 m), the Westend Tower (208 m) and the City-Haus (142 m).\n\nThere are more tall buildings at the Messe grounds: the world-renowned Messeturm (257 m, the tallest skyscraper in Europe between 1991–1997), the Westend Gate (159 m, the tallest skyscraper in Germany between 1976–1977).\n\nAs a predominantly residential area the Westend mainly has narrow roads, which are calm in relation to traffic. Apart from a few exceptions all the roads are one-way streets, which change directions at cross roads. Therefore, the Westend is much loved by driving schools. The exceptions are streets which lead out of the Westend borough into other parts of the city. Initially these streets are Eschersheimer Landstraße, the Anlagenring and the Alleenring, which carry a majority of the rush-hour and Messe traffic. Other important traffic-bearing streets are Bockheimer Landstraße as the main street to the Messe lying in an east-west direction, and the fairway made up of Reuterweg, Bremer Straße and Hansaallee as an arterial road in the North and Grüneburgweg as another east-west connection. Apart from that Grüneburgweg is also the Westend-Nord Westend-Süd border.\nThe Westend was one of the first boroughs with a connection to the tram network. In those days the main route lead through Bockenheimer Landstraße. Since the building of the C-route of the Frankfurt U-Bahn the Westend still only had Messe line 16, which travels through the western edge and over the Alleenring. The Westend was also attached to the underground from its very beginning. The A-route traffic ran through a tunnel under Eschersheimer Landstraße. The Westned had another U-Bahn route since 1986 underneath Bockenheimer Landstraße. The C-route runs from the Alte Oper to Bockenheimer Warte. A third U-Bahn route was added in 2001. The D-route runs underneath the Alleenring and serves the eastern Messe grounds. A railway junction developed at Bockenheimer Warte. Through the stations at Taunusanlage in the east and Messe in the west, the Westend is also linked into the Network of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn.\n\nDespite the high population density and the good traffic infrastructure the Westend has no hospitals, fire departments or police stations. All emergency services are however located close by in Nordend. In contrast the Westend has many superior educational facilities available. Near to the university the Westend has the Frankfurter Musikhochschule and the Sigmund-Freud-Insitut. Numerous schools can be found in the Westend of which several of primary schools (Elsa Brandström-Schule, Engelbert Humperdinck-Schule und Holzhausenschule), the I.E. Lichtigfeld-Schule of the Jewish community, a private school (Anna-Schmidt-Schule) and several grammar schools:\n\nKorean Air operates its Germany office in the district.\n\nAlong the Senckenberganlage from Georg-Voigt-Straße to Bockenheimer Warte lies the Campus Bockenheim of Johann Wolfgang Goethe University. The buildings still date from the start of the university or further back in time.\n\nThe construction of the Senckenberg Museum is also impressive. It was erected for the Senckenberg natural sciences society from 1904 to 1907 from plans by Ludwig Neher. The museum was erected in the tradition of the baroque castles. The full, representative facade, which captivates through the building of wings for the Physical Association and the Senckenberg library in the form of open arcades, is worth seeing.\n\nThe building, (known as \"Haus der Völkerfreundschaft\" to the locals) inaugurated in 1958 on the corner of Reuterweg and Staufenstraße, was supposed to bring the American culture in the form of books, films and music, closer to the people of Frankfurt.\n\nThe Messeturm is the second tallest building in the European Union. It is located on the western end of Westend-Süd at the fairground. Alongside is the Festhalle, a civic center, with a freely supported dome construction of glass and steel between stone corner-towers. It belongs to the first building which were constructed on the fairground. Regular exhibitions and concerts take place here. On the forecourt of both buildings stands the Hammering Man, a moving statue by American artist Jonathan Borofsky.\n\nThe established corporate headquarters of IG Farben were erected at Grüneburgpark in Westend-Nord in 1928. After World War II the IG Farben Building became the main location of the American armed forces in Europe. Since 2001 it serves as the new campus for the Goethe University. The surrounding Grüneburgpark lies in the curve of Miquelallee and is one of the biggest parks in Frankfurt.\n\nOne of the few original, preserved buildings remaining is the former Livingstonsche Pferdestall in Ulmenstraße. It is the only building left of a magnificent mansion complex of Max Livingston.\n\nThe Westend synagogue, located in Freiherr-vom-Stein-Straße 30, is the largest synagogue in Frankfurt and one of three currently used synagogues in Frankfurt.

{"id": "2309492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309492", "title": "A Period of Transition", "text": "A Period of Transition\n\nA Period of Transition is the ninth studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released in 1977 (see 1977 in music). It was his first album in two-and-a-half years, largely forgotten or overlooked by most casual fans. At the time of its release it was received with some disappointment by critics and fans: \"Most were hoping for a work of primeval vocal aggression that would challenge the emerging élite of Morrison pretenders, whose ranks included Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, Phil Lynott, Graham Parker and Elvis Costello.\" However, the album is still notable for several major compositions, including \"Heavy Connection\", \"Flamingos Fly\", \"The Eternal Kansas City\" and \"Cold Wind in August\".\n\nMorrison had appeared in \"The Last Waltz\" with Mac Rebennack (better known as Dr. John) who was a co-producer on this album as well as playing keyboards and guitar.\n\nClinton Heylin remarks on \"Flamingos Fly\" and \"Joyous Sound\": \"Just seven songs were recorded [for \"A Period of Transition\"] and two of these had already been cut at the Record Plant back in 1975.\" Both of these versions were included on the 1998 compilation album, \"The Philosopher's Stone\". \"Flamingos Fly\" was also recorded in 1973 with Jackie DeShannon and appeared on her 2003 reissue album \"Jackie... Plus\", along with three other original Morrison compositions from that recording session. It did not take Morrison long to play the song in concert – a week after the recording session on 18 April 1973, the song featured in a concert in Los Angeles at the Shrine Auditorium. This performance remains the only known live version of the song.\n\n\"You Gotta Make It Through the World\" is according to Morrison, \"a survival song\". Dr. John felt that it had \"a real spiritual sound\". \"It Fills You Up\" is an attempt by the singer to explain the inspirational spirit that is often found in his music. \"The Eternal Kansas City\" is, according to Dr. John, \"the song that Van got the whole album hooked up around. It was a real deep thing for him to focus on. It goes from a real ethereal voice sound to a jazz introduction and then into a kind of chunky R&B.\" The song, \"Joyous Sound\" is described by Brian Hinton as \"more like the real Van as he starts to wail and the lyrics describe themselves.\" Morrison said of the track, \"Flamingos Fly\", \"I've done three versions in the studio. I've done it slow, a ballad version. I've done a mid-tempo version and I've done this version. This is the version I like best for release.\" \"Heavy Connection\" is said to be \"psychic stuff\" with the lyrics vague and secret but speaking of a love connection \"when you came into my dreams/like from a whisper to a scream.\" The last song on the album is \"Cold Wind in August\". Dr. John describes it as a \"cross current from forties to seventies music. It's like where Ray Charles left off. It's a real tear-jerker that gets back to the basics of music.\" \"Flamingos Fly\" was covered by Sammy Hagar, a year before \"A Period of Transition\" was released, on his first solo album \"Nine on a Ten Scale\".\n\nIn a contemporary review for \"Rolling Stone\", Greil Marcus dismissed the songs as \"a lot of neo-R&B huffing and puffing\" and said \"Morrison's performances rarely find a focus, almost never hit a groove ... The key to the album's sluggishness is the dullness of the horn charts.\" Robert Christgau wrote in \"The Village Voice\": \"In general this is an unexciting record – but not definitively. It's full of the surprising touches... that signify talent putting out.\" Peter Knobler wrote in \"Crawdaddy\", \"The agonies of Morrison's earlier works are submerged—not obliterated, mind you, or denied, but not crowding out the obvious pleasure that carries the album forward.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine was more positive and said the album is \"warm, welcoming, infused with spirituality and humor. Still like any period of transition, this is somewhat tentative and uneven, with its best moments, being at best, minor masterpieces.\" Biographer Steve Turner called the album, \"lethargic and uninspired\" but says that perhaps it was the album Morrison needed to make after being largely absent from the music business for almost three years.\n\nExpectations were high and Morrison has admitted to working at his best when not under the pressure of high expectations from the industry and fans. In June 1977, he explained his feelings about this:\n\nThe album charted moderately well but most critics were disappointed, after waiting three years for a new album from Morrison. He had hired Harvey Goldsmith as manager and began a much more public media profile after the album's release. He recorded a session of \"The Midnight Special\" for NBC that was broadcast in April 1977, appearing with Carlos Santana, George Benson and Etta James. Morrison also began giving interviews again, commencing with his first interview since 1973 to Cameron Crowe from \"Rolling Stone\". In the interview when asked by Crowe: \"Is the album a document of the actual period? Is the transition over?\" Morrison replies: \"All of that. It's been going on for about three years ...it's like, there's been lots of highs and there's been depressions... there's been starts and stops...it's just a period, you know.\"\n\nMorrison has said that the title of the album referred to its front cover. Photographer Ken Mcgowan captured Morrison in various reflective, introspective moods until he realises with a half smile in the last shot that all such moods are transitory.\n\nAll songs written by Van Morrison unless noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Billboard\" (North America)\nUK Album Chart (United Kingdom)\n"}

It is the second largest municipality (with a population of 91,279 ) of the Thessaloniki Urban Area as well as one of the largest in Greece, with a population increase of 13% since the 1991 census.\n\nThe area was first settled by humans in prehistoric times, and remains from that settlement have been found around the Karabournaki cape.\n\nThe name Kalamaria was first used in 1083 to denote the area southeast of Thessaloniki, including but not limited to the area of the present-day municipality. During the Byzantine and the Ottoman periods, the area was mostly uninhabited, except for a few fishing lodges.\n\nThe first settlement was created in the early 1920s to house refugees from the Greek diaspora in Georgia and Asia Minor, who fled or were forcibly sent to Greece as a result of the Greco-Turkish War. As many as 100,000 refugees relocated to Thessaloniki, primarily to the city's suburbs. Refugees of Pontic descent mainly relocated in Kalamaria.\n\nIn 1931, an antisemitic riot, led by National Union of Greece, took place in Camp Campbell, located in nowadays Kalamaria, where a Jewish neighborhood was completely burned, leaving 500 families homeless and one Jewish resident dead.\n\nKalamaria has seen substantial recent growth as part of a population shift from rural and urban areas to suburban areas, particularly to those east of Thessaloniki. Between the 1981 and 2001 censuses, the population of Kalamaria grew by about 36,000 (or 69%). Up until 1943 Kalamaria was part of the Municipality of Thessaloniki. On 1 January 1943 it became an independent administrative unit.\n\nKalamaria had a population of 14,000 residents as recorded by an inventory in 1947, but this has considerably increased, as shown by the Greek census of 2001 where Kalamaria had a total of 87,255 residents. Kalamaria has the second highest population in the Council of the Town Planning Group of Thessaloniki but also of Northern Greece and ninth in all of Greece.\n\nThough it was originally separated from the main City of Thessaloniki, the municipality has grown so much in the post-war period that the older physical boundaries are virtually non-existent. Nowadays, the border between the two municipalities exists purely for administrative purposes.\n\nTraditionally the areas of Krini and Aretsou had been used as beaches and places for summer baths for the citizens of Thessaloniki, after WWII until the 1980s. The pollution of the Thermaic Gulf made this practice impossible since then.\n\nThe total area of the Municipality of Kalamaria covers . About two thirds of the perimeter are of coastline.\nThe municipality is separated into 10 geographical districts, which have been given names reminiscent of the refugees' former homelands.\n\n\nKalamaria has in total 14 sporting teams including Apollon Kalamarias.\n\nKalamaria is twinned with:\n\nIn addition to this, Kalamaria is partnered with:\n\nThe main roads that feed into the municipality are those of Konstantinos Karamanlis Avenue (formerly Nea Egnatia) to the east (which links with the A25 (the Thessaloniki-Chalkidiki motorway)), Taki Ekonomidi Avenue (which links the popular district of Nea Krini with Thessaloniki's city center), Megalou Alexandrou Avenue - the biggest avenue in Thessaloniki and the EO16 which provides the main access from Kalamaria to the airport and the outer south-eastern suburbs of Thessaloniki. Other main road links exist with Thermi, while the southeast end of the Thessaloniki ring road (which bypasses the Thessaloniki Urban Area) lies to the southeast of Kalamaria.\n\nThe first Mobility Centre in Greece started functioning in Kalamaria (June 2008).\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2309542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309542", "title": "The Burning Wheel", "text": "The Burning Wheel\n\nThe Burning Wheel is a fantasy role-playing game independently written and published by Luke Crane. The game uses a dice pool mechanic (using only standard six-sided dice) for task resolution and a character generation system that tracks the history and experiences of new characters from birth to the point they begin adventuring.\n\n\"The Burning Wheel\" does not include a dedicated setting. The rules, mechanics and backstory elements used in character generation imply a fantasy world by default, but can be easily modified, and the game includes mechanics for players to generate their own setting content during play, in the form of Wises and Circles tests.\n\nThe core game includes two volumes: \"The Burning Wheel\", containing rules and mechanics, and the \"Character Burner\", with additional rules and biographic elements for generating Humans, Dwarves, Elves, and Orcs as characters, providing each with unique exceptions or additions to the overall game mechanics. Humans have access to Sorcery and miraculous Faith, Elves have a Grief statistic and spell-songs, Dwarves have Greed, and Orcs have blasphemous Hatred.\n\nThe \"Monster Burner\" supplement includes premade monsters as well as mechanics and backstories for designing and building custom monsters, allowing the game to cover a much broader range of adventure and setting. This volume also contains four new and complete races for \"Burning Wheel\": Great Wolves, Roden (anthropomorphic rats), Great Spiders, and Trolls.\n\nThe \"Magic Burner\" supplement was released in August 2008. It expands the limited rules found in the main rule book by describing a variety of potential metaphysical sources of magic, with associated rules on how those affect what spells can do and how they are cast. The book also contains additional traits and skills useful for magic-wielding characters and a system for creating custom spells.\n\nThe \"Adventure Burner\" supplement was released in July 2010. It includes three ready-to-play scenarios, a host of pregenerated character templates for all officially supported races, and an extensive Commentary section that provides advice about how best to play the game and use the system for fun and challenge.\n\nThe game has had three dedicated settings:\n\nJanuary 2004: \"Under a Serpent Sun\", described as \"suicidal despair in a post-apocalyptic wasteland\".\n\nAugust 2005: \"Burning Sands: Jihad\", a science fiction expansion of galaxy-spanning religious war. A blog associated with the creators of \"Burning Wheel\" describes this expansion as being based on the \"Dune\" series.\n\nAugust 2007: \"The Blossoms are Falling\", based in Heian-era Japan. \"You play fearsome bushi trapped between honor and shame, wise Shinto priests who seek to placate the spirits who protect Nihon, powerful Buddhist monks who pray for the souls of the dead while plying strong influence at court, and powerful courtiers battling for control of the failing state.\"\n\nBurning Wheel play revolves around the players generating a detailed background history for their characters, along with core motivations and ethics (Instincts and Beliefs) that connect them to the storyline and to the other PCs. Story is intended to develop organically rather than being pre-scripted, as a number of the game mechanics (e.g., pre-negotiated roll or scene outcomes, the 'Let it Ride' rule, absence of hidden information) exist to prevent GM railroading and help promote co-operation and trust between the players. (This is quite distinct from agreement among the PCs, who may argue and even fight within the context of the rules.)\n\nThe GM is encouraged to create problems and challenges that specifically probe and test the Beliefs and Instincts of the PCs, and as a consequence characters frequently undergo significant change in their goals and attitudes over time.\n\nThe game also includes a variety of quite complex, but technically optional, sub-systems for dealing with combat, chases, negotiation and spellcasting.\n\nThe original rules (now referred to as \"Burning Wheel Classic\") were published 1 November 2002. A second edition, incorporating significant rules and text changes and generally referred to as \"Burning Wheel Revised\", was published 5 May 2005. A single-volume 600-page hardcover third edition, \"Burning Wheel Gold\", combined the contents of \"Burning Wheel Revised\" and \"Character Burner\" and was published 11 August 2011. In every case, the actual name of the game, as displayed on the cover art, is simply \"The Burning Wheel\". The three editions share many underlying concepts, but their rules are not entirely compatible.\nFollowing a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2016, a second book pertaining to the \"Burning Wheel Gold\" edition line was edited, the \"Burning Wheel Codex\". The \"Burning Wheel Codex\" updates the material from the Adventure, Monster and Magic Burner books for the previous Revised edition to the Gold rules, and also adds some new, original material and artwork.\n\nLuke Crane also wrote \"Burning Empires\", a science fiction RPG based on the \"Iron Empires\" graphic novels by Christopher Moeller. \"Burning Empires\" shares many mechanics with \"Burning Wheel\", and was released at Gen Con 2006.\nLuke has penned another full game, entitled \"Mouse Guard\", which uses a simplified version of the \"Burning Wheel\" system and is set in the world of the Mouse Guard comics. It won Best Role-Playing Game at the 2009 Origins Awards.\nAnother game in this line is Torchbearer.\n\n"}

{"id": "2309572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309572", "title": "Hammocking", "text": "Hammocking\n\nHammocking is a technique used in broadcast programming whereby an unpopular television program is scheduled between two popular ones in the hope that viewers will watch it, using the analogy of a hammock hanging between two strong and established trees. This is especially used for new shows. Public broadcasting also uses this as a way of promoting serious but valuable content. Hammocking may lead to situations where even if programs remain weak, audience rating will be high.\n\nThe main theory in play is that audiences are less likely to change channels for a single time slot. Presupposing that there are three available time slots, the weakest show would, under a hammocking strategy, be placed in the middle slot so that its lead-in, the show that airs before it, is a series popular enough to create a coattail effect when a viewer leaves the television on the same station; to keep people watching, another popular series is positioned in the lead-out slot after the weak show, so the viewer has reduced incentive to change the channel. The strength of the final program then presumably leads into the late local news, followed by late night programming, with the hope the channel remains unchanged after bedtime to allow a network affiliate television station to have strong ratings for its morning newscast leading into the network's morning show. This thus create a halo effect with the network's schedule in general to build network and affiliate station loyalty with a viewer.\n\nHammocking is a concept mainly limited to prime time, where \"appointment television\" is strong. However, there is a risk. If the middle show is too weak, the audience could change the channel altogether even if they “would have stayed if the two popular programs had formed a block.”\n\nHammocking has been fairly reliable over the years. It was largely discovered by accident in the late 1950s: Michael Dann is credited with developing the concept after \"December Bride\", thought to be a major hit at the time, underperformed when it lost its lead-in, \"I Love Lucy\". In some cases, the middle show becomes a hit. When the new show becomes just as popular, it has caught on. NBC used this strategy for years with its Must See TV Thursday night schedule, where the strong series on the night, \"Friends\", \"Seinfeld\"/\"Frasier\"/\"Will & Grace\" and \"ER\", provided two half-hour hammock spots in the night where newer sitcoms were positioned in order to provide strength throughout the night and build the network's bench on other nights if they proved successful, though many of the programs were critically derided for poor writing and acting and \"floating by\" on the ratings of other shows (\"The Single Guy\" and \"Union Square\" being the most prominent and higher-rated examples). So dominant was Must See TV, that a common industry joke of that era was the comparison of the hammocked shows to NBC instead placing a test pattern in the half-hour between the end of one top-of-the-hour show and the start of the other, and garnering equivalent ratings for much less effort and cost.\n\nAlso related is the concept of tent-pole programming, or using popular, well-established television shows scheduled in pivotal time periods to boost the ratings of the shows around them.\n\nThe WB had a similar experiment with an hour of hammocking on Mondays after \"7th Heaven\" and before the local news or off net syndicated programming. Examples of \"7th Heaven\"/local program hammocking include \"Savannah\", \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (until it was moved out of the hammock spot in 1998), \"Three\", \"Kelly Kelly\", \"Alright Already\", \"Hyperion Bay\", \"Rescue 77\", \"Safe Harbor\", the second season of \"Zoe\", \"Brutally Normal\", \"Roswell\" (until its move to UPN), \"Angel\" (until it was moved out of the hammock spot in 2002), \"Just Legal\", \"Related\" and \"Runaway\". The sole exception is \"Everwood\", because the show draws much more of an audience with \"7th Heaven\" than the hammock programs.\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, NBC experimented with a new hammocking format with Donald Trump's \"The Apprentice\", which aired between \"Friends\" and \"ER\". \"Much was made of the ratings for \"The Apprentice\", but in truth, even in its protected spot, it lost almost 4 points compared with the \"Friends\" lead-in and 2 points compared with \"ER\". Moreover, when moved to the unprotected Wednesday night slot, it dropped into the bottom third of the ratings.\"\n\nMore recently, ABC attempted to hammock programming after \"Modern Family\" and a drama after (in this case, either \"Revenge\", \"Designated Survivor\", or \"A Million Little Things\"), to middling or little success. Trying to hammock programs that have little in common with each other can have unusual consequences: TNBC, a block of programming NBC carried during the 1990s that had been aimed at teenagers, had a lead-in from \"Weekend Today\", a news program targeting those teens' parents. By the end of TNBC's run, after the block's teen viewership had declined, the average age of those recognized by the Nielsens as watching TNBC was 41 years old, driven mainly by the lead-in from \"Weekend Today\".\n\nVery more recently, CBS had an attempt to hammock programming between \"NCIS\" and \"\", which has proven somewhat successful. Examples include \"Bull\" (a series featuring former \"NCIS\" regular Michael Weatherly) and \"FBI\" (which launched a \"\" spin-off as a hammock end to the Tuesday evening schedule at the start of 2020).\n\nThe Super Bowl has regularly been used as a hammocking/tent-pole opportunity to take advantage of the massive lead-out audience the game produces. Most attempts to launch new series in the slot have been failures.\n\n"}

Taverner was appointed to survey this part of the coast and the adjacent islands where the French usually fished. His report, presented in 1718, included charts and noted the presence of French ships at Saint Pierre. From 1718 until 1725, Taverner was probably involved in the trade between Poole, Placentia and Saint Pierre. He and other Poole men were involved in the salmon fishery of the south coast in 1726.\n\nTaverner conducted another survey from 1726 to 1728, this time on the west and northeast coast of the Island of Newfoundland. Experimenting with trade and the fishery in the area, he was operating on his own account in the Strait of Belle Isle in 1729. As an advisor to the Board of Trade, Taverner was consulted in 1740 on the question of fortifications in Newfoundland. His review of the fishery for the years 1736 to 1739 demonstrated the need for protection. Most of Taverner's survey work was presented verbally rather than in chart form and few documents are extant. Nevertheless, Taverners work was significant in expanding English knowledge of the south coast and in pioneering trade in the areas previously dominated by the French and Basques.\n\nReference: \"Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2309579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309579", "title": "Condemned: Criminal Origins", "text": "Condemned: Criminal Origins\n\nCondemned: Criminal Origins (known in Europe as Condemned) is a first-person survival horror video game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Sega. It was launched worldwide in 2005 on the Xbox 360, with a Microsoft Windows version released later in 2006.\n\n\"Condemned: Criminal Origins\" places an emphasis on melee combat and puzzle solving, including searching for fingerprints and gathering evidence.\n\nUpon release, \"Condemned\" was met with moderate to good reviews by many aggregates and critics. Many reviewers cited its storyline and lack of progression as the game's biggest fault. As a reprieve, the game's solid controls and fresh approach to the horror genre were praised. A sequel, entitled \"\", was released in 2008 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Other media forms include an internet prequel and a planned film adaptation to expand the \"Condemned\" franchise. The developers have cited films such as \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and \"Seven\" as inspiration for the game.\n\nAlthough the game is played entirely from a first-person perspective (only broken for cut scenes), it is not a traditional first-person shooter. Firearms are present, but are somewhat uncommon. Unlike many other games from a first-person perspective, though, firearms are especially deadly, often killing enemies with a single shot. The guns that can be found, or taken from enemies, are only good for as long as the current ammo in the magazine lasts; once this is depleted, the butt of the gun can be used as a weapon. To complicate matters further, enemies operate firearms from the same ammo reserve, meaning once the enemy has been dispatched, the player only gets what ammo was left over from the fight. This encourages players to attack enemies carrying firearms quickly.\n\nThe focus of the experience is on improvised melee, allowing players and enemies to collect, or even pull, weapons from their surrounding environments, such as pipes, locker doors, shovels, and 2x4s. The developers of the game described the combat as 'visceral'. A quick-kick is available for attacking without, or alongside, a hand-held weapon, and attacks can be unleashed in different directions and configurations, such as left to right or overhead, but combat is notable for \"not\" utilizing a combo system, unlike similar titles such as \"\". In many cases, blocking is necessary both before and after landing a successful hit. The player can also perform \"finishing moves\" when the opponent is on his knees, such as headbutting or breaking their neck.\n\nThe artificial intelligence displayed by enemies requires the player to think on their feet a great deal more than similar games. Enemies are able to flee and hide effectively, often surprising the player by quickly appearing from a concealed spot. Enemies can also effectively feint, in order to trick the player into blocking at an inopportune time, leaving themselves open for the real attack.\n\nAlthough there are sharp weapons in the game, one cannot stab or dismember enemies. In fact, the player can almost never wield an actual knife or sword, with the exception being in the School level, where the player has brief access to a meat cleaver. Some melee weapons fall under the class of \"entry tool\", (like a fire axe for a rotten door, or a crowbar for a locked safe) and act as keys in the gameworld, allowing the player to access new areas or locked boxes.\n\nThe player also has a taser gun which when used stuns the target, does some damage and allows the player to seize the stunned enemy's weapon. Later in the game, Lieutenant Rosa gives the player a new upgraded taser, which is much more powerful, causing the enemy's legs to give out. One hit or shot after that will kill any enemy. Common uses for it are safely attacking enemies with guns (since it allows players to stun them from a distance and then seize the gun while the enemy is incapacitated), countering an immediate attack (since using the taser does not require the precise timing that blocking does) and obtaining the chance to make a free hit (a hit where the player does not risk being hit first). However, it has to recharge between shots so it cannot be used to bypass the game's system of carefully fighting enemies.\n\nThe entire game takes place in derelict urban environments, with minimum lighting. The player must use a flashlight to navigate through the game's constantly darkened environments, while dealing with frequent enemy ambushes.\n\nNear the end of the game the player loses both the flashlight and the taser. This means all strategies which required the taser become impossible and the only personal light source becomes burning planks which means carrying a gun reduces visibility. This effectively forces the player to rely exclusively on blocking, hiding and evasion for defense and close range attacks for offense.\n\n\"Condemned\" directly involves the player in crime scene investigations, offering the ability to, at the press of a context-sensitive button, call upon a suite of forensic tools to find and record evidence. The player character is linked to an FBI lab via his mobile phone throughout the investigation, allowing (almost immediate) remote examination and analysis by his support worker, Rosa. Crime scene evidence can be used to solve puzzles, allowing the player to pass previously impassable barriers, and provide clues to the overall mysteries of the story.\n\nExamples of evidence include fingerprints, footprints, fibers, fluids (such as blood or chemicals), particles, residues, markings/etchings, material, imprints, wounds, small objects, documents, and body parts.\n\nThe player character is gifted with the instinctual ability to detect when forensic evidence is nearby, allowing players to bring up the detection and collection tools when appropriate. However, the \"instincts\" of the character only vaguely highlight the area in which the evidence resides; it is up to the player to methodically sweep the scene and catalog any findings.\n\n\"Condemned: Criminal Origins\" is set in the fictional American city of Metro. The player takes on the role of Ethan Thomas, a crime scene investigation agent with the FBI's Serial Crime Unit, as he traverses the seedier sides of the city. His journey takes him through a number of condemned buildings as he searches for the one who framed him for murder, the evasive Serial Killer X. Along the way, Ethan must use his investigative intuition and technology to examine evidence left behind by SKX, all the while fighting off the violently psychotic denizens of Metro City, who seem to be driven to such madness by a mysterious, yet seemingly extraneous force.\n\nThe game's protagonist is Ethan Thomas (voiced by Greg Grunberg), an SCU investigator with unusually acute investigative instincts. He also is stated to have superhuman durability, as demonstrated by his ability to recover quickly from electrocution, long falls, and blunt trauma to the head, among others. He is aided in his investigations by Rosa, a forensics investigator at headquarters.\n\nThe primary antagonist of the game is Serial Killer X, who is hunting the serial killers that Ethan is searching for, killing them by the methods that they themselves use. Near the end of the game, he is revealed to be Leland Vanhorn, nephew of Ethan's friend Malcolm. Malcolm believes that Leland is being influenced by mysterious mutilated humanoid creatures that are causing an increase in insanity throughout the city.\n\nThe game begins with the protagonist, SCU agent Ethan Thomas, arriving at the scene of a murder. He and his fellow officers go into an abandoned building that is surrounded by psychopaths and criminals. The crime scene they investigate is one of a young woman. She is on the floor with strangulation wounds, sitting across a table from a male mannequin. Ethan, along with his colleagues, agree that the murder was most likely committed by the Match Maker, a serial killer that Ethan has been investigating. After they collect evidence from the scene, one of the officers smells cigarette smoke. Believing that the smoke must be coming from their suspect, they decide to split up and go after him. While searching for the suspect, Ethan tries to restore power from an electrical box. Due to an electrical surge, Ethan is shocked, and drops to the floor, causing his weapon to be thrown from his hand. A man hiding in the shadows takes it and flees. Ethan manages to chase the man into a small, dead-end room, where the man holds Ethan at gunpoint and tells him they have similar goals. Ethan's colleagues enter the room and tell the man to drop his weapon, and are promptly shot by the man with Ethan's gun, who then shoves Ethan out a window onto the street.\n\nEthan wakes in his apartment with Malcolm Vanhorn, a friend of Ethan's father, at his side. Malcolm warns Ethan that he is wanted for the deaths of the two officers who were shot with Ethan's gun. Ethan is determined to prove his innocence, although his own sanity appears to be slipping, as throughout the game he suffers numerous horrific visions, and all the while is forced to fight to the death in self-defence against homeless men and women who have inexplicably been driven insane.\n\nHe soon learns that the killer is interested in Ethan's SCU career. Later, he finds the body of the Match Maker, killed by his own modus operandi in an old department store. He presumes that the man at the original crime scene, referred to in the game as \"Serial Killer X\", is the culprit and that he is trying to kill the serial killers that Ethan is looking for. Ethan searches for the one that he thinks is next, a serial killer dubbed 'The Torturer'.\n\nEthan tracks the Torturer and Serial Killer X to an abandoned apple orchard in the rural town of Brier. Shortly before finding the Torturer in the farmhouse, Ethan is attacked by a strange man-like creature. Ethan kills the creature, and continues in his search. He searches through the farm where he eventually finds the Torturer dead, also killed by his own modus operandi. Soon, Ethan finds the mysterious killer, who is revealed to be Leland Vanhorn, nephew of Malcolm Vanhorn. Malcolm arrives and knocks Ethan out with a shovel to prevent him from hurting Leland. Leland then knocks Malcolm out.\n\nWhen Ethan revives, he is tied up and at the mercy of Leland. He explains to Ethan that he has been killing the serial killers that Ethan had been hunting, and that he intends to kill Ethan as well. As Leland thinks of all the ways that he can kill Ethan, cutting Ethan's finger off in the process, Ethan notices another man-like creature hiding in the rafters. This creature is known as 'The Hate' and is identified as the source of the madness gripping Metro City. Malcolm jumps Leland from behind and succeeds in wrestling him to the ground. Ethan manages to free himself, and Malcolm tells him to kill The Hate, saying that it is the cause of Leland's madness. Ethan pursues The Hate as it tries to escape, fighting waves of hideously burned homeless men along the way, and eventually corners it in a barn and kills it.\n\nAs Malcolm drives Ethan home, Ethan discovers that Leland is alive, and in the trunk of the car. When Ethan opens the trunk, he is given the option to shoot the tied-up Leland. If he does not shoot Leland, Leland pulls out his own gun and waves it at Ethan before committing suicide. Later, Ethan and Rosa are having a conversation in a diner when Rosa tips him off that she is wired, revealing that she still trusts him. Rosa then leaves the diner, and Ethan goes to the bathroom. While in the restroom, the player witnesses as Ethan's mouth becomes that of one of The Hate before the game comes to an abrupt halt.\n\nThe version of \"Condemned: Criminal Origins\" for the Xbox 360 console employs the achievements system mandated by Microsoft. As the criteria for the achievement awards are met, bonus content is unlocked, which can then be accessed from a special menu. Content includes concept and production sketches and paintings, work-in-progress animation, video from motion capture sessions, and a rather lengthy video showcasing a complete level from an early version of the game. These features were later carried over to the PC version of the game.\n\n\"Condemned: Criminal Origins\" was originally known as \"The Dark\", quite far into production. Under this name, the game was largely similar but differed in several key areas. The player character was known as Agent Cross, and the game appeared to follow him on a government-sanctioned investigation, or investigations, rather than acting as a rogue on the run from the law. Although Cross possessed the supernatural leanings of Thomas from the final game, he could actually use various magical spells. For example, a spell could be uttered to pull a gun from an enemy's hands and another spell saw doors and other obstacles break in front of the player, seemingly negating the need for a fire axe. The forensic tools used by Cross also differed, as the detection and collection tools were typically one individual item - the UV light, for instance, could illuminate clues and then be used to physically swipe across them, to take samples.\n\n\"Condemned: Criminal Origins\" received \"generally favorable reviews\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot said of the Xbox 360 version, \"it captures hand-to-hand combat with intense, lifelike brutality like no other game before it.\" In Japan, where the same console version was ported for release under the name on August 31, 2006, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 25 out of 40, while \"Famitsu Xbox 360\" gave it a score of two nines and two eights for a total of 34 out of 40.\n\n\"Detroit Free Press\" gave the Xbox 360 version a score of all four stars and said, \"Though the game could be longer and could stand more diversity, the cold shivers that run down your spine while playing it are an undeniable rush.\" \"Maxim\" gave it a score of eight out of ten and stated that the game, \"while not entirely original, still creatively mixes the first-person punching of \"\" with the jump-out-at-you frights of \"Doom 3\" and the investigative thrills of the best \"\" episode.\" \"The New York Times\" gave it a favorable review and stated that \"The game is also creepy in another way; you spend much of it essentially beating homeless people to death with pipes. Admittedly, these people attack you, and in fact will often attack and kill one another if you just get out of their way, but I still found it disturbing.\" However, \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave it a score of three stars out of five, saying, \"Frights are common as disturbingly psychopathic vagrants lunge at you from the shadows. The violence is raw, barbaric and unsettling.\" \"Edge\", however, gave it a score of six out of ten and called it \"a scary, vicious, visually progressive if rather hollow next-gen showcase that doesn’t outstay its welcome. If you want to spend a night or two in the company of the future of horror videogaming, you could do a lot worse.\"\n\nIn February 2008 all copies of \"Condemned\" were confiscated in Germany because of , which outlaws the dissemination or public display of media \"which describe cruel or otherwise inhuman acts of violence against human beings in a manner which expresses a glorification or rendering harmless of such acts of violence or which represents the cruel or inhuman aspects of the event in a manner which injures human dignity.\" Distribution in Germany is now prohibited by law.\n\nA six-part episodic online game was released on the \"Condemned: Criminal Origins\" website. The protagonist is Agent Mallory, who is searching for a serial killer. In the last episode, Mallory is killed by Serial Killer X. The game ends where \"Condemned: Criminal Origins\" begins.\n\nA direct sequel to the game was released in 2008. It was titled \"Condemned 2: Bloodshot\" to show the character evolution in protagonist Ethan Thomas. The game was developed by Monolith and published by Sega, the same companies as the original. It expanded on the gameplay elements from \"Condemned\" and added several new features such as online multiplayer and environmental kills.\n\nOn October 4, 2005, Warner Brothers Studios announced plans to release a film adaptation which is set in the same \"universe\" as the then upcoming \"Condemned: Criminal Origins\". Warner Bros. Studios had acquired Monolith Productions during 2004 and was expecting 2008 to be announced, but never was.\nA report from \"The Variety\" stated that Kurt Sutter, co-executive producer of the television series \"The Shield\", would be writing the screenplay for the film under the working title \"Unforgettable\".\n\nAccording to earlier drafts of the script, a police officer hunts down a serial killer in an attempt to clear his name from murder. However, during the process he discovers that he may be tied to other ongoing murder cases in an unusual way. The cop soon begins to question throughout his investigation upon discovering his supernatural abilities, \"who he is as a man, until he realizes he's not a man. A tug-of-war emerges among a faction of good and evil aliens.\"\n\nAlso connected with the project is \"Jace Hall\", a former Monolith CEO who joined Warner Bros. to become Vice president of Operations over their gaming division. Hall, along with Nathan Henderickson, was responsible for the film's concept and state that he seeks to \"come up with something specifically designed to use multiple mediums to tell stories that had some continuity and connective thread... We wanted to create a universe that, like a \"Star Wars\", was big enough where different stories could exist.\" \"Variety\" indicated that the plan was to introduce audiences to the \"universe\" of \"Condemned\" with \"Criminal Origins\", followed by a film adaptation which will tie-in with a sequel video game gradually expanding the story's universe.\n"}

It did not accomplish this objective as it was lost in a launch failure. It was the first of four E-1 missions to be launched.\n\nLuna E-1 No.1 was a spacecraft which marked the first Soviet attempt to send a spacecraft to the Moon. It was also the first mission of the Luna programme. The spacecraft was intended to release of sodium, in order to create a \"comet\" of the metal which could be observed from Earth, allowing the spacecraft to be tracked. Prior to the release of information about its mission, NASA correctly identified that it had been an attempted lunar impact mission.\n\nChief Designer Sergei Korolev's ambitious space plans were being continually frustrated by design changes to the R-7 missile, launch failures, and the fact that the ICBM program took priority. On 10 July 1958, a test version of the Luna booster was flown which had a dummy upper stage (live avionics, but no engine) in order to try out the modifications to the R-7, which included a stronger airframe to support the added weight of the upper stage and more powerful engines (these engines had first been tested on Sputnik 3's booster a few months earlier). At liftoff, the Blok D strap-on suffered an engine malfunction and broke off of the booster, impacting on the pad and exploding. The rest of the R-7 crashed a few hundred feet away. This accident, which caused considerable damage to Site 1/5, was traced to high-frequency vibrations in the combustion chamber of Blok D, something that would become a persistent problem on R-7 launches over the next two years. Since the first Luna probe was scheduled for launch in a month, repairs on the pad were done at breakneck speed.\n\nAs Korolev knew that the United States was planning to launch a lunar probe on 17 August 1958, he faced considerable pressure getting the Luna and its booster ready for launch. Despite a number of technical issues, the pad crews managed to get the booster ready on the 17 August 1958, but Korolev instead decided to let the US flight go first on the reasoning that the Luna probe had a shorter trajectory to travel and would reach the Moon first. After that launch ended in a booster explosion, he decided to postpone the flight until the glitches with the 8K72 and Luna could be worked out.\n\nLuna E-1 No.1 was launched on 23 September 1958 at 07:40:23 GMT atop a Luna 8K72 carrier rocket, flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Ninety two seconds after launch, longitudinal resonance within the rocket's strap-on booster rockets caused the vehicle to disintegrate.\n"}

Entering the University of Erfurt in 1514, he received his bachelor's degree in 1515 and his master's degree in 1516. At this time, in association with the keen humanists Conrad Mutian, Crotus Rubeanus, and Eoban Hess, Menius became more sceptical. Moving to Wittenberg in 1519, he became evangelical under the teaching of Philipp Melanchthon and the preaching of Martin Luther.\n\nAfter travel in Italy (1521-1522) Menius was appointed (1523) town preacher at Wittenberg, but was soon transferred to the charge of Mühlberg, under Erfurt. Here he published his commentary on Acts (1524) and married. He resigned his charge (1525) and opened a school at Erfurt, but the town council insisted on his resuming his ministry, appointing him preacher in St Thomas, Erfurt. He worked in conjunction with Luther's friend, John Lange, and was opposed by the Franciscans under Conrad Kling.\n\nMenius left for Gotha (1528), resumed teaching, and enjoyed the friendship of Friedrich Myconius. John, Elector of Saxony, had placed him on the commission for church visitation in Thuringia, and in 1529 appointed him pastor and superintendent at Eisenach, where for eighteen years he administered church affairs with tact, and fostered the spread of education. In 1529 he brought out his \"Oeconomia christiana\" (a treatise in German, on the right ordering of a Christian household) with a dedication to Duchess Sybil of Saxony and a preface by Luther.\n\nMenius's tractate, written in concert with Myconius, controverting \"Der Wiedertaufer Lehre und Geheimniss\" (1530) was also prefaced by Luther. The reversion to the Roman communion of his old friend Crotus led to his mordant \"Responsio amici\" (1532, anon.) to the \"Apologia\" (1531) of Crotus. He took his part in the theological disputations of the time, at Marburg (1529), the Concordia at Wittenberg (1536), the Convention at Schmalkalden (1537), and the discussions at Hagenau and Worms (1540). His tractate (1542) against the permission of bigamy in the case of Philip of Hesse was not allowed to be printed (the manuscript is in the University of Heidelberg library).\n\nIn 1542 Menius moved to Mühlhausen, being appointed by Maurice, Elector of Saxony, for the ordering of the church there. On the death of Myconius (1546) he was entrusted with the oversight of Gotha, in addition to that of Eisenach; to Gotha he returned in 1547.\n\nThe remainder of his life was not happy. He was against the Leipzig Interim (1548) with its compromise on some Catholic usages, and was involved in controversies and quarrels; with Georgius Merula, against whom he maintained the need of exorcism in baptism; with Osiander's adherents in the matter of justification; with his colleague, Nicholas von Amsdorf, to whom he had resigned the Eisenach superintendency; with Flacius Illyricus, and others.\n\nHe lost favor with John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, fell into bad health, was deposed (1555) from his offices, and was disappointed in his hopes of being reinstated, after the colloquy at Eisenach (1556). He died at Leipzig.\n\nMenius was twice married, and had several sons, of whom Eusebius held a chair of philosophy at Wittenberg, and married Melanchthon's granddaughter, Anna Sabinus.\n\nG. L. Schmidt gives a full bibliography of the numerous writings of Menius, who translated several of Luthers biblical commentaries into German. His Oeconomia was reprinted in 1855.\n\n"}

{"id": "2309612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309612", "title": "Paranormal television", "text": "Paranormal television\n\nParanormal television is a genre of reality television. Its scope comprises purportedly factual investigations of paranormal phenomena, rather than fictional representations found in such shows and films as \"The Ghosts of Motley Hall\", \"Ghostbusters\", \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"Rentaghost\".\n\nAccounts of supernatural occurrences have always been common in the print media. The 1705 pamphlet \"A True Relation of the Apparition of One Mrs Veal\" by Daniel Defoe is a well-known example. Paranormal television proper can trace its genesis to local TV news programs in the UK and USA, which have featured ghost stories since the 1960s. The earliest TV show devoted exclusively to the paranormal was \"\" which broadcast 96 episodes on the ABC network from 1959 to 1961. The stories were promoted as being based on actual real-life experiences, including historically well-known events such as sinking of RMS \"Titanic\", the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. \n\nIt was followed 15 years later by \"In Search of...\", hosted by Leonard Nimoy which ran for six years from 1976. Rod Serling was originally slated to host the series, but he died in 1975. \"In Search of...\" explored many paranormal topics, including UFOs, cryptozoological creatures (cryptids), lost civilizations, and other mysteries. Though the subject matter gradually lost popularity, the show gave way to future TV series following the same genre. \n\n\"Unsolved Mysteries\", which began airing in 1987 and ended in 2002, would feature paranormal cases from time to time, and further popularised the documentary aspect of paranormal television. \"Ghostwatch\", a fictional news broadcast about a haunted house in the UK that aired in 1992, created controversy when a majority of viewers believed the televised show was real. Discovery Channel started to explore the genre with some success from 1996. The Fox Broadcasting Company aired a news-style oriented show \"Sightings\" which lasted for six years. MTV's \"Fear\" premiered in 2000, establishing a visual look and editing style followed by many paranormal reality television shows. In 2002, the British satellite channel Living TV launched the paranormal documentary-investigative series \"Most Haunted\", a series which airs as of 2019.\n\nWith the series \"Ghost Hunters\", which premiered in 2004 on Sci Fi (later Syfy), the paranormal TV genre and ghost-hunting became popularized and the show inspired spin-offs on Sci Fi (as well as later successor shows after its initial run) and many paranormal television productions on other networks. Sci Fi would move into airing many other paranormal shows around that time, such as \"Destination Truth\". \"Ghost Adventures\", another ghost-hunting program, which premiered on the Discovery Networks-owned Travel Channel in 2008, was the successor to a documentary film of the same name that aired on Sci Fi in 2007. A&E aired the prominent ghost-hunting series \"Paranormal State\" from 2007–2011, and History Channel began to compete in the general paranormal genre around this time with series such as \"UFO Files\", \"MonsterQuest\", \"UFO Hunters\" and the documentary special \"Ancient Aliens\", which led to a successor series that began airing in 2010.\n\nSyfy would abandon their focus on paranormal programming by 2015, and \"Ghost Hunters\" itself left the network in 2016 after 11 seasons. Around that time, Travel Channel moved completely into airing exclusively paranormal television series (the network initially centering programming around \"Ghost Adventures\") frequently featuring ghost hunting, including series related to \"Ghost Adventures\", as well as later productions featuring former \"Ghost Hunters\" members such as \"Kindred Spirits\" (2014–present) and \"Ghost Nation\" (2019–present). Destination America planned to compete with Travel Channel's paranormal programming (seasons 1-2 of \"Kindred Spirits\" aired on DA and TLC), but reversed course after it and TLC were reacquired by Discovery Networks during their acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive in 2018. In 2019, \"Ghost Hunters\" was revived by A&E and aired a 12th season on the channel with a 13th season coming in 2020.\n\nNoting the recent trend in reality shows that take the paranormal at face value, The New York Times Culture editor Mike Hale characterized ghost hunting shows as \"pure theater\" and compared the genre to professional wrestling or soft core pornography for its formulaic, teasing approach.\n\n\"Los Angeles Times\" staff writer Ed Stockly wrote that \"the paranormal/supernatural-investigation subgenre that has cropped up on cable television over the last few years, which includes \"Ghost Hunters\", \"Destination Truth\", \"Ghost Adventures\", \"Ghost Hunters International\" and a few others\" promises to \"take a skeptical approach in its investigations and to rely on science to confirm or disprove paranormal claims. So far not one has been able to consistently keep that promise.\"\n\nWriter Diane Dorby proposes that paranormal reality TV shows provide \"plausibility structures\" that people use for \"interpreting the meaning and experience of death\".\n\nAccording to science writer Sharon A. Hill, \"Paranormal reality TV shows are designed as entertainment for the curious, not science documentaries to discover truths. If the tempo is too slow it will be sped up by giving \"reality\" a boost\".\n\n"}

The ship was part of a 1703 expedition commanded by William Dampier, who captained an accompanying ship, the 26-gun \"St George\" with a complement of 120 men.\n\nWhen the War of the Spanish Succession broke out in 1701, English privateers were recruited to act against French and Spanish interests. Despite a court-martial for cruelty to one of his crew in an earlier voyage, Dampier was granted command of the two-ship expedition which departed England on 30 April 1703 for the port of Kinsale in Ireland.\n\nWilliam Dampier's original companions dropped out of the scheme and a new agreement was made with Captain Charles Pickering of \"Cinque Ports\". \"Cinque Ports\" was fitted out with 16 guns and a crew of 63. The two ships left Kinsale on 11 September 1703 with the intention of attacking Spanish galleons returning from Buenos Aires. When this plan fell through the privateers decided to make for the South Sea by way of Cape Horn. While the ships were off the coast of Brazil an outbreak of scurvy on board \"Cinque Ports\" led to the death of a number of men, including the captain who was replaced by 21-year-old Lieutenant Thomas Stradling.\nAfter rounding the Horn and cruising up the South American coast as far as Panama, capturing several Spanish ships on the way, the two captains decided to separate. Captain Stradling stopped at one of the islands of the Juan Fernández Archipelago off the Chilean coast in September 1704 to resupply. There was a dispute between Stradling and Alexander Selkirk regarding \"Cinque Ports\" seaworthiness, and Selkirk impetuously chose to be put ashore on the uninhabited island.\n\nSelkirk remained on Juan Fernández in solitude for four years and four months, before being rescued by Woodes Rogers in 1709. His experience was one of the likely sources of inspiration for the character Robinson Crusoe in the novel by Daniel Defoe. Selkirk's suspicions were soon justified, as \"Cinque Ports\" foundered near Malpelo Island from the coast of what is now Colombia, with Stradling and the surviving members of his crew being taken prisoner by the Spanish.\n\nAn eyewitness account of the last voyage of \"Cinque Ports\" was published by William Funnell, an officer on board \"St George\", who went on to circumnavigate the globe after abandoning Dampier in January 1705. The owners of \"Cinque Ports\" subsequently took legal action against Dampier over the loss of their ship. According to a deposition given by Selkirk on 18 July 1712, Dampier's failure to advise the owners to have \"Cinque Ports\" and \"St George\" covered in protective wood sheathing had resulted in \"the loss of both ships, for they perished by being worm eaten.\" Other witnesses supported this allegation. The shipowners would be disappointed, however, as Dampier died in 1715, leaving nothing but debts.\n\n"}

Krueger that, contrary to widely accepted beliefs among economists, the minimum wage increase in New Jersey did not result in job reduction of fast food companies in that state. While the methodology (see difference in differences) and its claim has been disputed by some (see minimum wage for discussion), many economists, including Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman, accept Card and Krueger's findings.\n\nDavid Card has also made fundamental contributions to research on immigration, education, job training and inequality. Much of Card's work centers on a comparison between the United States and Canada in various situations. On immigration, Card's research has shown that the economic impact of new immigrants is minimal. Card has done several case studies on the rapid assimilation of immigrant groups, finding that they have little or no impact on wages. In an interview with \"The New York Times\", Card said, \"I honestly think the economic arguments [against immigration] are second order. They are almost irrelevant.\" This does not imply, however, that Card believes immigration should be increased, merely that immigrants do not pose a threat to the labour market.\n\nDespite the fact that Card sometimes researches issues with strong political implications, he does not publicly take a stand on political issues or make policy suggestions. Nevertheless, his work is regularly cited in support of increased immigration and minimum wage legislation.\n\nCard earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Queen's University in 1978 and his Ph.D. degree in economics in 1983 from Princeton University, after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \"Indexation in long term labor contracts\", under the supervision of Orley Ashenfelter.\n\nCard began his career at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, where he was Assistant Professor of Business Economics from 1982 to 1983. He was on the faculty at Princeton University from 1983 to 1997, before moving to Berkeley.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1992, Card was Associate Editor of the \"Journal of Labor Economics\" and from 1993 to 1997, he was co-editor of \"Econometrica\". From 2002 to 2005, he was co-editor of \"The American Economic Review\".\n\nHe was the recipient of the 1995 John Bates Clark Medal, awarded to \"that American economist under the age of forty who is judged to have made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge.\" He gave the 2009 Richard T. Ely Lecture of the American Economic Association in San Francisco. A 2011 survey of economics professors named Card their fifth favorite living economist under the age of 60. Along with N. Gregory Mankiw, he was elected vice president of the American Economic Association for 2014.\n\nHe has received along with Richard Blundell the 2014 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Economics, Finance and Management category for \"their contributions to empirical microeconomics,\" in the words of the jury’s citation. \"Motivated by important empirical questions, they developed and estimated appropriate econometric models, making significant methodological contributions in the process.

It featured the 57th Formula One World Championship which began on 12 March and ended on 22 October after eighteen races. The Drivers' Championship was won by Fernando Alonso of Renault for the second year in a row, with Alonso becoming the youngest ever double world champion at the time. Then-retiring multiple world champion Michael Schumacher of Scuderia Ferrari finished runner-up, 13 points behind. The Constructors' Championship was won by Renault, which defeated Ferrari by five points.\n\nThe season was highlighted by the rivalry between Alonso and Schumacher, who each won seven races. Renault and Ferrari drivers dominated the field, victorious in all but one race, and the four second-place finishes not achieved by these two teams were accomplished by McLaren. During this season for the first time since the season no British constructor won any race and like 1956, only factory teams won all the races during this year. This season marked the beginning of the usage of 2.4L V8 engines in Formula One from the 3.0L V10 engines that were used in the previous seasons, which continued till the end of the season. 2006 was also the first season since 1997 that various engine configurations were featured only for Scuderia Toro Rosso that had Cosworth TJ2006 3.0-litre V10 powerplant.\n\nThe season saw several changes occurring in the drivers' market starting already in December 2005 as Alonso sealed a move to McLaren for 2007. Then in September, Schumacher announced his retirement from Formula One at the end of the season, with 2003 and 2005 championship runner-up Kimi Räikkönen being announced as his replacement at Ferrari. Among other notable departures included Juan Pablo Montoya, who left McLaren mid-season to pursue a career in NASCAR.\n\nThe following teams and drivers competed in the 2006 FIA Formula One World Championship.\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Grand Prix was held later than usual, to avoid a clash with the 2006 Commonwealth Games. For the first time, Bahrain hosted the first Grand Prix. Brazil hosted the last race, while Japan and China swapped their original dates.\n\nIn 2006, the FIA announced the Belgian Grand Prix would not be part of the 2006 Formula One season, since the local authorities had started major repair work in Spa-Francorchamps. The Belgian Grand Prix returned in 2007, when Kimi Räikkönen took pole position and his 3rd Belgian Grand Prix win in a row.\n\n\n\nThe calendar was initially announced as the same as for 2005, with the Belgian Grand Prix scheduled for 17 September. However, on 8 February, the FIA announced that the Belgian National Sporting Authority (RACB) were withdrawing Spa-Francorchamps from the 2006 Formula One calendar due to lack of time to complete improvements to the track. The race has traditionally received strong support from drivers and FIA President Max Mosley and the Grand Prix was back on the Grand Prix calendar for the season.\n\n2006 was the last season with two tyre manufacturers: The two manufacturers at the time were Japanese manufacturer Bridgestone and French company Michelin. In December 2005, the FIA announced that from the 2008 season, there would be only one tyre supplier. Five days later, Michelin announced it would quit Formula One at the end of the 2006 season as it did not want to be in Formula One as the sole tyre supplier.\n\nAt the end of 2005, three well-known teams were bought out: Minardi, Sauber and Jordan. The former were bought by Red Bull to be run as a junior team to house their growing list of young talent looking for an F1 drive. Despite campaigns by Minardi fans the team were renamed Scuderia Toro Rosso (Toro Rosso), Italian for \"Team Red Bull\". The Sauber team was purchased by BMW. BMW opted to keep the Sauber name in F1 renaming the team BMW Sauber. Jordan, who had been bought by the Midland Group in 2004, changed their name to MF1 Racing after a transition year in 2005.\n\n2006 also saw the introduction of a new Japanese team, Super Aguri F1, founded by former F1 driver Aguri Suzuki, who entered at the last moment. Super Aguri notified the FIA on 1 November 2005 (ahead of the governing body's 15 November deadline) of their intention to enter, but the FIA's initial entry list stated they had not approved Aguri's entry. However, the team received the consent of the ten existing teams to compete and paid the US$48 million bond required as a deposit. The team was confirmed by the FIA on 26 January 2006.\n\nBetween the 2005 and 2006 season the ownership of Formula One changed significantly. Until November 2005 the Formula One group was owned by an Ecclestone family trust and Speed Investments (a grouping of Bayerische Landesbank, JP Morgan Chase and Lehman Brothers). On 25 November, CVC Capital Partners announced it was to purchase both the Ecclestone shares (25% of SLEC) and Bayerische Landesbank's 48% share, held through Speed Investments. By 30 March, CVC had acquired all remaining shares and later that month the European Commission announced approval of this deal, conditional upon CVC relinquishing control of Dorna Sports, promoter of MotoGP. On 28 March CVC announced the completion of the Formula One transaction. Ecclestone reinvested proceeds of his stake into the new Formula One parent company Alpha Prema.\n\nAnother Ecclestone victory involved the Grand Prix Manufacturers' Association's proposal for an alternative World Championship. On 27 March, the five car manufacturers involved lodged applications for the season, reducing the likelihood of a breakaway series. On 14 May, Grand Prix Manufacturers' Association (GPMA) members confirmed they had signed a Memorandum of Understanding, a move toward signing a new Concorde Agreement. Five days later, Bernie Ecclestone and CVC Capital Partners signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the GPMA which should see the five \"rebels\" continue racing in Formula One at least until the 2012 season.\n\nAfter a disastrous season and slow start to the 2006 season Michael Schumacher won consecutive races at Imola and the Nürburgring. During the final lap of his qualifying session for the Monaco Grand Prix, Schumacher came to a stop at the La Rascasse hairpin, resulting in yellow flags, meaning that other drivers could not go at maximum speed. After the session there were immediate complaints from the other teams claiming that this was a deliberate move by Schumacher to ensure he started in pole position – Alonso's flying lap that was affected by the yellow flags had been likely to beat Schumacher's fastest time – at the end of the second sector, Alonso was more than two-tenths of a second ahead of Schumacher's time, and his final time was just 0.064 seconds slower than Schumacher. Although Schumacher insisted that he had simply locked up his brakes at the corner, a stewards' inquiry stated, \"We are left with no alternative but to conclude that the driver deliberately stopped his car on the circuit.\" The penalty was that Schumacher's qualifying times were all deleted, demoting him to 22nd position on the grid. He opted to start from the pitlane, and finished fifth, after an incident in the race that required the safety car to be deployed. The Safety Car failed to aid Schumacher however, but in fact hampered him; because he was the last car to be lapped by leader Alonso, and under 2006 FIA rules; he was not allowed to un-lap himself under Safety Car conditions. This meant he was almost a full lap down on third placed Coulthard, and fourth placed Barrichello on the resumption of the race. But by the end, he was threatening to pass them for position; finishing less than two seconds off a podium spot.\n\nAt the British Grand Prix, Alonso became the first Spanish driver and the youngest driver (24 years and 317 days) to win a race from pole and get fastest lap, leading every lap of the race except one. Schumacher won the United States Grand Prix, his fourth consecutive victory at Indianapolis and fifth career victory there, and the French Grand Prix.\n\nThe FIA decided that the 'Mass Damper' system used by Renault up to this point of the season did not meet the technical regulations, and it was banned – a polemical decision, since the FIA itself was consulted about the system during its development, and authorised its use. The effect of the ban was clear at the next race where the Renaults struggled to even get points. Schumacher also won the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, with Alonso finishing 5th.\n\nJenson Button achieved his first Formula One career victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix. Alonso had a mechanical failure whilst leading in the latter stages of the race whilst Michael Schumacher retired after a collision with Nick Heidfeld. However Schumacher was promoted to eighth place in the standings (having been classified ninth following a retirement three laps from the end) because Robert Kubica's debut ended in disqualification. The Polish driver had finished seventh in the BMW.\n\nFelipe Massa won the next Grand Prix in Turkey, so for the second race in a row, Formula One had a maiden victor. Fernando Alonso extended his lead over Michael Schumacher by two points after he managed to finish a tenth of a second ahead of the German in second place.\n\nAt the Italian Grand Prix, Alonso was given a penalty for 'holding up' Massa during the final qualification session. Many in the Formula One 'paddock' were reported to disagree with the penalty and Max Mosley has since said that he would not have issued the same penalty as the race stewards. Schumacher reduced Alonso's lead to only two points after winning the race while Alonso suffered an engine failure in the late stages of the race. Despite a fourth-place finish for Alonso's teammate, Giancarlo Fisichella, and a flat-spotted tyre causing Felipe Massa to score no points, the race also saw Ferrari pull ahead of Renault for the first time in 2006. Polish driver Robert Kubica took his BMW Sauber to his first podium finish, in only his third race, but the race results were largely overshadowed by Schumacher announcing, during the post-race press conference, that he would retire at the end of the season. Afterwards he did say that he would hold a position in the Ferrari F1 team for 2007, though he did not disclose what.\n\nThree weeks later, with his victory at Shanghai right ahead of Alonso, Schumacher drew level on points with him at the head of the championship. Schumacher led the World Championship for the first time in 2006 after the race, as he had won seven races compared to Alonso's six. Massa did not finish the race, and Renault gained again the lead in the Constructors' Championship thanks to Fisichella's third place. As Shanghai would prove to be the German's last victory of the season as well as the 91st and last victory of his career before retiring at the end of the season.\n\nA week later at the Japanese Grand Prix, Felipe Massa took pole ahead of Michael Schumacher in second and Fernando Alonso in fifth. Schumacher quickly took the lead and set about gaining a five-second lead, which continued until after the second round of pit stops. However, Schumacher's engine failed with 17 laps to go, forcing him to retire and handing Alonso the win ahead of Massa.\n\nAt the final round, the Brazilian Grand Prix, Massa again took pole. Drama in qualifying saw Michael Schumacher have a mysterious failure, meaning that he started down in tenth, while Alonso began in fifth. In the race, Schumacher had yet more bad luck, suffering a puncture just a few laps in. He recovered to finish fourth, while teammate Massa became the first Brazilian to win his home Grand Prix since Ayrton Senna in 1993. Alonso finished second to secure his second successive championship, adding the record of the youngest man to secure back-to-back titles to his ever-increasing list of records.

Bilas is a former college basketball player and coach who played for and served as assistant under Mike Krzyzewski at Duke University, as well as a practicing attorney in North Carolina.\n\nBilas was a consensus Top 50 recruit at Rolling Hills High School, in Rolling Hills Estates, California, where he averaged 23.5 points and 13.5 rebounds per game in 1982. That season, Bilas was named First Team All-CIF, First Team All-South Bay, MVP of the Bay League, and Best in the West by the Long Beach Press-Telegram.\n\nBilas was a four-year starter for Mike Krzyzewski at Duke University, on the men's basketball team, from 1982–1986, and helped lead Duke to the Final Four and National Championship game in 1986. Krzyzewski's 1982 recruiting class of Bilas, Johnny Dawkins, Mark Alarie and David Henderson still ranks as the highest scoring single class in college basketball history. In his college career, Bilas scored 1,062 points and grabbed 692 rebounds, while shooting over 55% from the field.\n\nIn 1985, Bilas represented USA Basketball, on the U.S. National Select Team, in the Jones Cup in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nBilas graduated in 1986, with a degree in political science, and was selected in the fifth round of the 1986 NBA Draft, by the Dallas Mavericks. He played professionally overseas in Italy's 2nd Division and in Spain's 1st Division.\n\nBilas served as an assistant coach under Mike Krzyzewski at Duke for three seasons from 1990 to 1992. While serving as an assistant coach, Bilas attended Duke University School of Law, receiving his J.D. degree in 1992.

Bilas began his broadcast career delivering color commentary alongside play-by-play man Bob Harris for the Duke Radio Network in 1993. Bilas joined ESPN in 1995 as a college basketball analyst on games and in the studio. He has served as co-host of ESPN's studio broadcasts since 2000, including \"College GameNight\" and \"College GameDay\" with Rece Davis, Hubert Davis, Digger Phelps, and Bob Knight. Bilas makes frequent appearances on \"SportsCenter\", ESPNEWS and ESPN Radio, and is a featured basketball writer on ESPN.com. He is also featured as \"The Bilastrator\" during halftime segments of some ESPN college basketball games. From 2003 through 2010, Bilas joined CBS as a game analyst for the network's coverage of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, and was paired with Dick Enberg as his color analyst from 2005 through 2010. In both 2007 and 2008, Bilas was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Performance by a Studio Analyst. He has gained notoriety in the studio for his ability to draw up unique inbound plays after time outs during close games, as well as his stand when it comes regarding student athlete payment and his thoughts on the NCAA as a whole.\n\nBilas received his J.D. degree from Duke University School of Law in 1992. He is currently Of Counsel to the Charlotte office of Moore & Van Allen, where he maintains a litigation practice.\n\nBilas most notably worked on the case \"Lyons Partnership v. Morris Costumes, Inc.\", where he successfully defended the costume business against trademark and copyright claims brought by owners of the popular children's television character Barney the Dinosaur.\n\nWriting a letter to the editor in Duke Magazine, Bilas sharply criticized the Duke administration for its lack of support for the falsely indicted players during the 2006 Duke lacrosse case. Describing Richard H. Brodhead's actions, \"President Brodhead chose the path of political expediency. He failed to effectively counter factually inaccurate and inappropriate statements about Duke and its students, failed to forcefully speak out against procedural irregularities, and failed to take appropriate action in response to repeated attacks upon the due process rights of Duke's students.\"\n\nBilas resides in Charlotte, North Carolina, with his wife of 21 years, Wendy, and their son and daughter. Bilas is on the Advisory Board of the Duke Brain Tumor Center and the PinStripes/ALS Foundation, as well as serving on the Board of Directors of Coaches vs. Cancer.\n\nBilas joined the Screen Actors Guild in 1987.

Almost all useful tungsten ores are tungstates.\n\nOrthotungstates feature tetrahedral W(VI) centres with short W–O distances of 1.79 Å. Structurally, they resemble sulfates. Six-coordinate, octahedral tungsten dominates in the polyoxotungstates. In these compounds, the W–O distances are elongated.\n\nSome examples of tungstate ions:\nSee the for a list of tungstates.\n\nTungstates occur naturally with molybdates.

She is the best-selling contemporary Christian artist of all time, with over 30 million albums sold worldwide, and she has recorded 17 No. 1 albums on the \"Billboard\" Christian Albums chart, more than any other artist in the chart's history.\n\nAt the age of 15, Grant signed a record deal with Myrrh Records. A year later in 1977, she released her self-titled debut album, which sold over 50,000 copies in its first year of release - an impressive total at the time for a Christian artist. Her follow-up albums \"My Father's Eyes\" (1978) and \"Never Alone\" (1980) reached the No. 1 spot on the Christian Albums chart, and 1982's \"Age to Age\" became the first Christian album recorded by a solo artist to receive gold and platinum certifications from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

{"id": "2309752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309752", "title": "Komatiite", "text": "Komatiite\n\nKomatiite () is a type of ultramafic mantle-derived volcanic rock defined as having crystallised from a lava with ≥ 18 wt% MgO. Komatiites have low silicon, potassium and aluminium, and high to extremely high magnesium content. Komatiite was named for its type locality along the Komati River in South Africa, and frequently displays spinifex texture composed of large dendritic plates of olivine and pyroxene.\n\nKomatiites are rare and predominantly found in rocks of Archaean age, with few Proterozoic or Phanerozoic komatiites known. This restriction in age is thought to be due to cooling of the mantle, which may have been 100 – 250°C hotter during the Archaean (4.0 to 2.5 billion years ago). The early Earth had much higher heat production, due to the residual heat from planetary accretion, as well as the greater abundance of radioactive elements. Lower temperature mantle melts such as basalt and picrite have essentially replaced komatiites as an eruptive lava on the Earth's surface.\n\nGeographically, komatiites are predominantly restricted in distribution to the Archaean shield areas, and occur with other ultramafic and high-magnesian mafic volcanic rocks in Archaean greenstone belts. The youngest komatiites are from the island of Gorgona on the Caribbean oceanic plateau off the Pacific coast of Colombia, and a rare example of Proterozoic komatiite is found in the Winnipegosis komatiite belt, Manitoba, Canada.\n\nMagmas of komatiitic compositions have a very high melting point, with calculated eruption temperatures up to, and possibly in excess of 1600 °C. Basaltic lavas normally have eruption temperatures of about 1100 to 1250 °C. The higher melting temperatures required to produce komatiite have been attributed to the presumed higher geothermal gradients in the Archaean Earth.\n\nKomatiitic lava was extremely fluid when it erupted (possessing the viscosity close to that of water but with the density of rock). Compared to the basaltic lava of the Hawaiian plume basalts at ~1200 °C, which flows the way treacle or honey does, the komatiitic lava would have flowed swiftly across the surface, leaving extremely thin lava flows (down to 10 mm thick). The major komatiitic sequences preserved in Archaean rocks are thus considered to be lava tubes, ponds of lava etc., where the komatiitic lava accumulated.\n\nKomatiite chemistry is different from that of basaltic and other common mantle-produced magmas, because of differences in degrees of partial melting. Komatiites are considered to have been formed by high degrees of partial melting, usually greater than 50%, and hence have high MgO with low KO and other incompatible elements. \n\nThere are two geochemical classes of komatiite; aluminium undepleted komatiite (AUDK) (also known as Group I komatiites) and aluminium depleted komatiite (ADK) (also known as Group II komatiites), defined by their AlO/TiO ratios. These two classes of komatiite are often assumed to represent a real petrological source difference between the two types related to depth of melt generation. Al-depleted komatiites have been modeled by melting experiments as being produced by high degrees of partial melting at high pressure where garnet in the source is not melted, whereas Al-undepleted komatiites are produced by high degrees of partial melts at lesser depth. However, recent studies of fluid inclusions in chrome spinels from the cumulate zones of komatiite flows have shown that a single komatiite flow can be derived from the mixing of parental magmas with a range of AlO/TiO ratios, calling into question this interpretation of the formations of the different komatiite groups. Komatiites probably form in extremely hot mantle plumes.\n\nBoninite magmatism is similar to komatiite magmatism but is produced by fluid-fluxed melting above a subduction zone. Boninites with 10–18% MgO tend to have higher large-ion lithophile elements (LILE: Ba, Rb, Sr) than komatiites.\n\nThe pristine volcanic mineralogy of komatiites is composed of forsteritic olivine (Fo90 and upwards), calcic and often chromian pyroxene, anorthite (An85 and upwards) and chromite.\n\nA considerable population of komatiite examples show a cumulate texture and morphology. The usual cumulate mineralogy is highly magnesium rich forsterite olivine, though chromian pyroxene cumulates are also possible (though rarer).\n\nVolcanic rocks rich in magnesium may be produced by accumulation of olivine phenocrysts in basalt melts of normal chemistry: an example is picrite. Part of the evidence that komatiites are not magnesium-rich simply because of cumulate olivine is textural: some contain spinifex texture, a texture attributable to rapid crystallization of the olivine in a thermal gradient in the upper part of a lava flow. \"Spinifex\" texture is named after the common name for the Australian grass \"Triodia\", which grows in clumps with similar shapes.\n\nAnother line of evidence is that the MgO content of olivines formed in komatiites is toward the nearly pure MgO forsterite composition, which can only be achieved in bulk by crystallisation of olivine from a highly magnesian melt.\n\nThe often rarely preserved flow top breccia and pillow margin zones in some komatiite flows are essentially volcanic glass, quenched in contact with overlying water or air. Because they are rapidly cooled, they represent the liquid composition of the komatiites, and thus record an anhydrous MgO content of up to 32% MgO. Some of the highest magnesian komatiites with clear textural preservation are those of the Barberton belt in South Africa, where liquids with up to 34% MgO can be inferred using bulk rock and olivine compositions.\n\nThe mineralogy of a komatiite varies systematically through the typical stratigraphic section of a komatiite flow and reflects magmatic processes which komatiites are susceptible to during their eruption and cooling. The typical mineralogical variation is from a flow base composed of olivine cumulate, to a spinifex textured zone composed of bladed olivine and ideally a pyroxene spinifex zone and olivine-rich chill zone on the upper eruptive rind of the flow unit. \n\nPrimary (magmatic) mineral species also encountered in komatiites include olivine, the pyroxenes augite, pigeonite and bronzite, plagioclase, chromite, ilmenite and rarely pargasitic amphibole. Secondary (metamorphic) minerals include serpentine, chlorite, amphibole, sodic plagioclase, quartz, iron oxides and rarely phlogopite, baddeleyite, and pyrope or hydrogrossular garnet.\n\nAll known komatiites have been metamorphosed, therefore should technically be termed 'metakomatiite' though the prefix meta is inevitably assumed. Many komatiites are highly altered and serpentinized or carbonated from metamorphism and metasomatism. This results in significant changes to the mineralogy and the texture.\n\nThe metamorphic mineralogy of ultramafic rocks, particularly komatiites, is only partially controlled by composition. The character of the connate fluids which are present during low temperature metamorphism whether prograde or retrograde control the metamorphic assemblage of a metakomatiite (\"hereafter the prefix meta- is assumed\").\n\nThe factor controlling the mineral assemblage is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide within the metamorphic fluid, called the XCO. If XCO is above 0.5, the metamorphic reactions favor formation of talc, magnesite (magnesium carbonate), and tremolite amphibole. These are classed as talc-carbonation reactions. Below XCO of 0.5, metamorphic reactions in the presence of water favor production of serpentinite.\n\nThere are thus two main classes of metamorphic komatiite; carbonated and hydrated. Carbonated komatiites and peridotites form a series of rocks dominated by the minerals chlorite, talc, magnesite or dolomite and tremolite. Hydrated metamorphic rock assemblages are dominated by the minerals chlorite, serpentine-antigorite, brucite. Traces of talc, tremolite and dolomite may be present, as it is very rare that no carbon dioxide is present in metamorphic fluids. At higher metamorphic grades, anthophyllite, enstatite, olivine and diopside dominate as the rock mass dehydrates.\n\nKomatiite tends to fractionate from high-magnesium compositions in the flow bases where olivine cumulates dominate, to lower magnesium compositions higher up in the flow. Thus, the current metamorphic mineralogy of a komatiite will reflect the chemistry, which in turn represents an inference as to its volcanological facies and stratigraphic position.\n\nTypical metamorphic mineralogy is tremolite-chlorite, or talc-chlorite mineralogy in the upper spinifex zones. The more magnesian-rich olivine-rich flow base facies tend to be free from tremolite and chlorite mineralogy and are dominated by either serpentine-brucite +/- anthophyllite if hydrated, or talc-magnesite if carbonated. The upper flow facies tend to be dominated by talc, chlorite, tremolite, and other magnesian amphiboles (anthophyllite, cummingtonite, gedrite, etc.).\n\nFor example, the typical flow facies (see below) may have the following mineralogy;\nKomatiite can be classified according to the following geochemical criteria;\n\nThe above geochemical classification must be the essentially unaltered magma chemistry and not the result of crystal accumulation (as in peridotite). Through a typical komatiite flow sequence the chemistry of the rock will change according to the internal fractionation which occurs during eruption. This tends to lower MgO, Cr, Ni, and increase Al, KO, Na, CaO and SiO toward the top of the flow.\n\nRocks rich in MgO, KO, Ba, Cs, and Rb may be lamprophyres, kimberlites or other rare ultramafic, potassic or ultrapotassic rocks.\n\nKomatiites often show pillow lava structure, autobrecciated upper margins consistent with underwater eruption forming a rigid upper skin to the lava flows. Proximal volcanic facies are thinner and interleaved with sulfidic sediments, black shales, cherts and tholeiitic basalts. Komatiites were produced from a relatively wet mantle. Evidence of this is from their association with felsics, occurrences of komatiitic tuffs, Niobium anomalies and by S- and HO-borne rich mineralizations.\n\nA common and distinctive texture is known as \"spinifex texture\" and consists of long acicular phenocrysts of olivine (or pseudomorphs of alteration minerals after olivine) or pyroxene which give the rock a bladed appearance especially on a weathered surface. Spinifex texture is the result of rapid crystallization of highly magnesian liquid in the thermal gradient at the margin of the flow or sill..\n\n\"Harrisite texture\", first described from the locality of Harris Bay, Rùm, Scotland, is formed by nucleation of crystals on the floor of the lava flow chamber. Harrisites are known to form megacrystal aggregates of pyroxene and olivine up to 1 metre in length.\n\nKomatiite volcano morphology is interpreted to have the general form and structure of a shield volcano, typical of most large basalt edifices, as the magmatic event which forms komatiites erupts less magnesian materials.\n\nHowever, the initial flux of the most magnesian magmas is interpreted to form a channelised flow facie, which is envisioned as a fissure vent releasing highly fluid komatiitic lava onto the surface. This then flows outwards from the vent fissure, concentrating into topographical lows, and forming channel environments composed of high MgO olivine adcumulate flanked by a 'sheeted flow facies' aprons of lower MgO olivine and pyroxene thin-flow spinifex sheets.\n\nThe typical komatiite lava flow has six stratigraphically related elements;\nIndividual flow units may not be entirely preserved, as subsequent flow units may thermally erode the A zone spinifex flows. In the distal thin flow facies,\nB zones are poorly developed to absent, as not enough through-flowing liquid existed to grow the adcumulate.\n\nThe channel and sheeted flows are then covered by high-magnesian basalts and tholeiitic basalts as the volcanic event evolves to less magnesian compositions. The subsequent magmatism, being higher silica melts, tends to form a more typical shield volcano architecture.\n\nKomatiite magma is extremely dense and unlikely to reach the surface, being more likely to pool lower within the crust. Modern (post-2004) interpretations of some of the larger olivine adcumulate bodies in the Yilgarn craton have revealed that the majority of komatiite olivine adcumulate occurrences are likely to be subvolcanic to intrusive in nature.\n\nThis is recognised at the Mt Keith nickel deposit where wall-rock intrusive textures and xenoliths of felsic country rocks have been recognised within the low-strain contacts. The previous interpretations of these large komatiite bodies was that they were \"super channels\" or reactivated channels, which grew to over 500 m in stratigraphic thickness during prolonged volcanism.\n\nThese intrusions are considered to be \"channelised sills\", formed by injection of komatiitic magma into the stratigraphy, and inflation of the magma chamber. Economic nickel-mineralised olivine adcumulate bodies may represent a form of sill-like conduit, where magma pools in a staging chamber before erupting onto the surface.\n\nThe economic importance of komatiite was first widely recognised in the early 1960s with the discovery of massive nickel sulfide mineralisation at Kambalda, Western Australia. Komatiite-hosted nickel-copper sulfide mineralisation today accounts for about 14% of the world's nickel production, mostly from Australia, Canada and South Africa.\n\nKomatiites are associated with nickel and gold deposits in Australia, Canada, South Africa and most recently in the Guiana shield of South America.\n\n\n\n"}

The T-50 is South Korea's first indigenous supersonic aircraft and one of the world's few supersonic trainers. Development began in the late 1990s, and its maiden flight occurred in 2002. The aircraft entered active service with the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) in 2005.\n\nThe T-50 has been further developed into aerobatic and combat variants, namely T-50B, TA-50, and FA-50. The F-50 single-seat multirole fighter variant was considered. The T-50B serves with the South Korean air force's aerobatics team. The TA-50 light attack variant has been ordered by Indonesia. The Philippines ordered 12 units of the FA-50 variant. The T-50A was marketed as a candidate for the United States Air Force's next-generation T-X trainer program but failed to win. Thailand ordered 12 units of the T-50 advanced trainer variant.\n\nThe T-50 program was originally intended to develop an indigenous trainer aircraft capable of supersonic flight, to train and prepare pilots for the KF-16 and F-15K, replacing trainers such as T-38 and A-37 that were then in service with the ROKAF. Prior South Korean aircraft programs include the turboprop KT-1 basic trainer produced by Daewoo Aerospace (now part of KAI), and license-manufactured KF-16. In general, the T-50 series of aircraft closely resembles the KF-16 in configuration.\n\nThe mother program, code-named KTX-2, began in 1992, but the Ministry of Finance and Economy suspended KTX-2 in 1995 due to financial constraints. The basic design of the aircraft was set by 1999. The development of the aircraft was funded 70% by the South Korean government, 17% by KAI, and 13% by Lockheed Martin. The program benefited from the assistance of many Taiwanese engineers who were veterans of AIDC’s F-CK-1 program.\n\nThe aircraft was formally designated as the T-50 Golden Eagle in February 2000. The T-50A designation was reserved by the U.S. military to prevent it from being inadvertently assigned to another aircraft model. Final assembly of the first T-50 took place between 15 January and 14 September 2001. The first flight of the T-50 took place in August 2002, and initial operational assessment from 28 July to 14 August 2003.\n\nKAI and Lockheed Martin are currently pursuing a joint marketing program for the T-50 internationally. The ROKAF placed a production contract for 25 T-50s in December 2003, with aircraft scheduled to be delivered between 2005 and 2009. Original T-50 aircraft are equipped with the AN/APG-67(v)4 radar from Lockheed Martin. The T-50 is equipped with a GE F404 engine with Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) built under license by Samsung Techwin. Under the terms of the T-50/F404-102 co-production agreement, GE provides engine kits directly to Samsung Techwin who produces designated parts as well as performing final engine assembly and testing.\n\nThe program has expanded beyond a trainer concept to include the TA-50 light attack aircraft and the FA-50 light combat aircraft. The TA-50 variant is a more heavily armed version of the T-50 trainer, intended for lead-in fighter training and light attack roles. It is equipped with the Elta EL/M-2032 fire control radar. The TA-50 is designed to operate as a full-fledged combat platform for precision-guided weapons, air-to-air missiles, and air-to-ground missiles. The TA-50 can mount additional utility pods for reconnaissance, targeting assistance, and electronic warfare. Reconnaissance and electronic warfare variants are also being developed, designated as RA-50 and EA-50.\nThe FA-50 is the most advanced version of the T-50, possessing more internal fuel capacity, enhanced avionics, a longer radome and a tactical datalink. It is equipped with a modified Israeli EL/M-2032 pulse-Doppler radar with Korean-specific modifications by LIG Nex1. The engine could be either Eurojet EJ200 or General Electric F414, upgraded to 20,000 lb or 22,000 lb thrust, roughly 12–25% higher than the F404's thrust; and are offered to prospective customers for the T-50. The radar of the FA-50 has a range two-thirds greater than the TA-50's radar. The EL/M-2032 was initially chosen over Lockheed Martin's preferred AN/APG-67(V)4 and SELEX Vixen 500E active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars. Other AESA radars such as Raytheon Advanced Combat Radar and Northrop Grumman's Scalable Agile Beam Radar are options for future production, and may be shared with the radar chosen for USAF and ROKAF F-16 fighters. Samsung Thales is also independently developing a domestic multi-mode AESA radar for the FA-50.\n\nIn December 2008, South Korea awarded a contract to KAI to convert four T-50s to FA-50 standard by 2012. In 2012, the ROKAF ordered 20 FA-50 fighters to be delivered by the end of 2014. The maiden flight of the FA-50 took place in 2011. 60 FA-50 aircraft are to be produced for the ROKAF from 2013 to 2016. KAI received a 1.1 trillion won ($1 billion) order for FA-50 fighter aircraft in May 2013.\n\nIn December 2015, KAI announced and revealed the new KAI-LM T-50 T-X upgrade intended to compete in the U.S. T-X program that will start testing in 2016. This variant features a dorsal hump for extra internal fuel and an aerial refuelling receptacle, large area display (LAD), and embedded ground training systems.\n\nIn October ADEX 2017, KAI unveiled the T-50A as a new variant based on the FA-50 multirole combat aircraft, including fifth generation cockpit, an aerial refuelling receptacle, cockpit multifunction display, dorsal hump for extra internal fuel, and an embedded training suite.\n\nIn January 2019, KAI has begun development on an improved FA-50 known as block 10 and block 20 upgrades. Block 10 is a software upgrade so it can use the Lockheed Martin AN/AAQ-33 Sniper targeting pod, while the block 20 is improvement capability to conduct beyond-visual-range air-to-air missions, carrying munitions such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM.\n\nThe T-50 Golden Eagle design is largely derived from the F-16 Fighting Falcon, and they have some similarities. KAI's previous engineering experience in license-producing the KF-16 was a starting point for T-50 development.\n\nThe trainer has seating for two pilots in a tandem arrangement. The high-mounted canopy developed by Hankuk Fiber is applied with stretched acrylic, providing the pilots good visibility. The trainer has been tested to offer the canopy with ballistic protection against 4-lb objects impacting at 400 knots. The altitude limit is 14,600 metres (48,000 ft), and airframe is designed to last 8,000 hours of service. There are seven internal fuel tanks with capacity of 2,655 litres (701 US gal), five in the fuselage and two in the wings. An additional 1,710 litres (452 US gal) of fuel can be carried in the three external fuel tanks. T-50 trainer variants have a paint scheme of white and red, and aerobatic variants white, black, and yellow.\n\nThe T-50 uses a single General Electric F404-102 turbofan engine license-produced by Samsung Techwin, upgraded with a FADEC system jointly developed by General Electric and KAI. The engine consists of three-staged fans, seven axial stage arrangement, and an afterburner. The aircraft has a maximum speed of Mach 1.5. Its engine produces a maximum of 78.7 kN (17,700 lbf) of thrust with afterburner. The more powerful F414 and EJ200 engines have been suggested as the new engine for the T-50 family.\n\nThe T-50's central processing unit and its operating system are developed by MDS Technology. The T-50's NEOS avionics operating system is the first and only real-time operating system to be developed by an Asian company, and holds both DO-178B and IEEE POSIX certification. Samsung Thales and LIG Nex1 are the main avionics and electronic warfare equipment developers for T-50 and its variants. Other South Korean companies and defense institutes such as DoDAAM Systems, Aeromaster, Intellics, and Korea Institute of Defense Analysis are responsible for the aircraft's secondary avionics and embedded systems, including store management computers, avionics testing equipment, flight data recorders, portable maintenance aids, data analysis software, post-flight data processing system, aircraft structure and engine management software, and mission planning and support systems. The TA-50 version is equipped with an ELTA EL/M-2032 fire control radar.\n\nThe T-50 is equipped with a Honeywell H-764G embedded global positioning/inertial navigation system and HG9550 radar altimeter. The aircraft is the first trainer to feature triple-redundant digital fly-by-wire controls. The cockpit panels, switches, and joysticks are produced by South Korea's FirsTec and Sungjin Techwin, head-up display by DoDaaM Systems, and multi-function display by Samsung Thales. Other South Korean subcontractors such as Elemech, Dawin Friction, and Withus cooperate in T-50 components production. Hanwha supplies the mechanical parts for the flight control system, and WIA supplies the undercarriage.\n\nThe TA-50 version has a three-barrel cannon version of the M61 Vulcan mounted internally behind the cockpit, which fires linkless 20 mm ammunition. Wingtip rails can accommodate the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, and a variety of additional weapons can be mounted to underwing hardpoints. Compatible air-to-surface weapons include the AGM-65 Maverick missile, Hydra 70 and LOGIR rocket launchers, CBU-58 and Mk-20 cluster bombs, and Mk-82, −83, and −84 general-purpose bombs.\n\nThe FA-50 can be externally fitted with Rafael's Sky Shield or LIG Nex1's ALQ-200K ECM pods, Sniper or LITENING targeting pods, and Condor 2 reconnaissance pods to further improve the fighter's electronic warfare, reconnaissance, and targeting capabilities. Other improved weapon systems include SPICE multifunctional guidance kits, Textron CBU-97/105 Sensor Fuzed Weapon with WCMD tail kits, JDAM, JDAM-ER for more comprehensive air-to-ground operations, and AIM-120 missiles for BVR air-to-air operations. FA-50 has provisions for, but does not yet integrate, Python and Derby missiles, also produced by Rafael, and other anti-ship missiles, stand-off weapons, and sensors to be domestically developed by Korea. The South Korean military is reviewing whether to arm the FA-50 with a smaller version of the KEPD 350 missile to give it a stand-off engagement capability of .\n\nIn February 2018, European maker MBDA, in Singapore air show showcased an offer of its Meteor and ASRAAM medium and short-range air-to-air missiles available for integration for the KAI platforms FA-50 and future KF-X fighter jets.\n\nIn 2011, the first squadron with the TA-50, the T-50's light attack variant, become operational with the ROKAF. The ROKAF's Black Eagles aerobatic team operates the T-50B version. In 2014, the FA-50 was officially deployed by the ROKAF with President Park Geun-hye officially leading a ceremony during which a flight demonstration was held showing its capabilities. 20 FA-50s was assigned its own Air Force wing. 60 FA-50s were ordered by ROKAF. On 9 October 2014, an FA-50 successfully test fired an AGM-65 Maverick at a stationary target, a retired ship.\n\nIndonesia had been considering the T-50, along with four other aircraft to replace its BAE Systems Hawk Mk 53 trainer and OV-10 Bronco attack aircraft. In August 2010, Indonesia announced that T-50, Yak-130 and L-159 were the remaining candidates for its requirement for 16 advanced jet trainers. In May 2011, Indonesia signed a contract to order 16 T-50 aircraft for US$400 million. The aircraft is to feature weapons pylons and gun modules, enabling light attack capabilities. The Golden Eagles are to replace the Hawk Mk 53 in Indonesian Air Force service. Indonesia's version has been designated \"T-50i\". Deliveries began in September 2013. The last pair of T-50i aircraft were delivered in January 2014.\n\nIraq was negotiating the acquisition of T-50 trainer jets, having first publicly expressed official interest during the Korea–Iraq summit in Seoul on 24 February 2009. In April 2010, Iraq reopened the jet lead-in fighter-trainer competition for 24 aircraft, in which TA-50 competed. In December 2013, it was announced that Iraq signed a contract for 24 aircraft of the FA-50 variant designated T-50IQ, plus additional equipment and pilot training over the next 20 years. Deliveries were to begin in April 2016, with all aircraft to be delivered over the next 12 months.\n\nThe Philippine Air Force chose 12 KAI TA-50 aircraft to fulfill its requirement for a light attack and lead-in fighter trainer aircraft. The Department of National Defense (DND) announced the selection of the type in August 2012. Funding for 12 aircraft was approved by Congress on September 2012, but by late January 2013, state media reported that the FA-50, not the TA-50 as previously reported, was selected for the procurement.\n\nIn October 2013, President Aquino said the DND was close to finalizing the FA-50 deal, and on 19 October 2013, President Aquino and President Park Geun-hye of South Korea signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with provisions for acquisitions. On 13 February 2014, President Aquino approved the payment scheme for purchasing 12 lead-in fighter trainers with P18.9 billion ($415.7 million) budgeted. On 28 March 2014, the Philippines' Department of National Defense signed a contract for 12 FA-50 light attack aircraft worth P18.9 billion (US$421.12 million).\n\nDeliveries began in November 2015 and were expected to be completed in May 2017. The first four FA-50PH aircraft delivered were displayed on 1 December 2016. All deliveries were completed by 31 May 2017.\n\nPlans call for 3 or 4 of the 12 aircraft to be fitted with capability for beyond visual range (BVR) intercept. In March 2015, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported that the Philippines plans to order additional FA-50s, which is supported by the PAF Flight Plan 2028 that lists another 12 FA-50s planned for the future.\n\nIn June 2018, it was discussed that the Philippine Air Force is reviewing the possibility of acquiring 12 more units.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, two Philippine Air Force FA-50PHs conducted a nighttime attack on terrorist hideouts in Butig, Lanao del Sur province in Mindanao, the first combat sorties flown by these aircraft.\n\nIn June 2017, FA-50s were deployed to conduct airstrikes against Maute terrorists entrenched in the city of Marawi starting in May 2017.\n\nOn 12 July 2017, an FA-50 was involved in a friendly fire incident during the Battle of Marawi when a bomb landed approximately 250 meters off target, killing two Philippine soldiers and injuring 11 more. Investigation resulted in clearing the aircrew and aircraft of fault and the type was allowed to return to active service in August.\n\nOn 2 February 2019, two Air Force FA-50s dropped eight 250-pound bombs on the lair of the ISIS-linked Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) in response to the bomb attack on the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cathedral in Barangay Walled City, Jolo, Sulu.\n\nIn September 2015, the Thai government chose the KAI T-50 variant for its air force over the Chinese Hongdu L-15 to replace its aging L-39 Albatros trainers. The 4 T-50TH aircraft are scheduled to be delivered by March 2018. In July 2017, Thailand's government approved the procurement of 8 more aircraft with a contract signing expected later in the month. Deliveries began in January 2018.\n\nThe Spanish Air Force is interested in a cooperation agreement with South Korea for use of training aircraft, including the T-50. In November 2018, Spain is in talks with South Korea to swap 50 basic T-50 jet trainers for 4 to 5 Airbus A400M airlifters.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) is seeking 35–40 fighter-trainers. In February 2009, the UAE selected the M-346 over the T-50. In January 2010, the UAE reopened the trainer contest. In 2011, it was confirmed that the T-50 was still competing for the UAE purchase.\n\nAzerbaijan has expressed interest in purchasing T-50 trainers.\n\nBrunei has expressed interest in the FA-50.\n\nSouth Korea also plans to offer the FA-50 to Colombia and Peru.\n\nThe Pakistan Air Force is considering purchase of the South Korean KAI T-50 Lead In Fighter Trainer (LIFT) to revamp its air force training program.\n\nVietnam looks to purchase FA-50 light fighters from U.S. and South Korea.\n\nTaiwan is looking to replace its current fleet of AT-3 jet trainers and F-5 LIFT planes with 66 advanced trainers, the Republic of China Air Force released a request for information (RFI) and two companies have responded including Lockheed Martin for the T-50 and Alenia Aermacchi's M-346 responded to the request. The planes are expected to be license produced in Taiwan with a local partner firm, and the overall estimated contract value is 69 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$2.2 billion). However, Taiwan decided to build 66 AIDC T-5 Brave Eagle supersonic trainers based on Taiwan's existing AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighters for NT$68.6 billion instead of selecting the T-50 or M-346.\n\nThe FA-50 is also being offered to Croatia, which is deciding on a replacement for its aging fleet of MiG-21BIS aircraft. However, in October 2017, KAI did not bid as the FA-50 could not satisfy Croatian fighter requirements.\n\nThe Argentine Air Force evaluated the FA-50 as a potential new platform in 2016. The Argentine government is seeking to buy the FA-50 through repatriation in Korea. MSN reported the Argentine defense minister said that when the financial aid is secured a contract for the FA-50 with KAI can be signed by December 2017. As of July 2019, the Argentine Air Force, is set to buy F/A-50s as an interim replacement for the retired Mirage 3, 5, and Dagger force. It is also to help replace the retiring A-4AR Fightinghawk fleet, as those aircraft are aging and becoming difficult to repair and maintain. If the deal is approved it will be a first step in modernizing and revitalizing the country's fighter fleet.\n\nThe Royal Malaysian Air Force is looking for a light combat aircraft that also can serve as a lead-in fighter trainer (LIFT) platform and should be ready for fielding in about 2021-22. The official noted that others are being considered but a preference for the T-50/FA-50 aircraft in service with near-neighbours the Philippines and the Republic of Korea.\n\nLocal media reported that the FA-50 could be a more affordable option than the Saab Gripen for the Botswana Defence Force Air Wing, citing Korean Aerospace Industries, signaling potential interest by the country.\n\nIn the U.S., the T-50 was one of the contenders for the U.S. Air Force's T-X program, with an opportunity to export 300 to 1,000 aircraft.\n\nPoland stated tender for new AJTs, in which T-50 was participating. M-346 was chosen.\n\nSingapore evaluated the T-50 against the Italian Alenia Aermacchi M-346 and the BAE Systems Hawk for a $500 million trainer acquisition program contract for 12–16 aircraft. The Singapore Ministry of Defense eventually selected the M-346 aircraft ahead of T-50 and BAE Hawk in July 2010.\n\nIsrael had been evaluating the T-50 as a possible replacement for its McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk II trainers since 2003. On 16 February 2012, Israel announced its decision to procure 30 M-346s instead.\n\nIn October 2015, the U.S. refused to approve the sale of the KAI T-50 advance trainer to Uzbekistan. The T-50 uses a US-made engine, the F404, which requires a US export license to re-export to another country along the T-50. However, due to political considerations related to Uzbekistan, US refused to approve this.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He rose rapidly into favor under Philip IV, who appointed him private secretary, commissioned from him \"comedias palaciegas\" for the royal theatre at Aranjuez, and in 1623 conferred on him the orders of Santiago and Calatrava. Most of his contemporaries and rivals paid court to \"el discreto de palacio\", and Mendoza seems to have lived on the friendliest terms with all his brother dramatists except Ruiz de Alarcón. He is said to have been involved in the fall of Olivares, and died unexpectedly at Zaragoza on 19 September 1644.\n\nHis theatrical works include numerous entremés works.\n\nOnly one of his plays, \"Querer por solo querer\", was published with his consent; it is included in a volume (1623) containing his semi-official account of the performances at Aranjuez in 1622. The best edition of Mendoza's plays and verses bears the title of \"Obras liricas y comicas, divinas y humanas\" (1728). Much of his work does not rise above the level of graceful and accomplished verse; but that he had higher qualities is shown by \"El marido hace mujer\", a brilliant comedy of manners, which forms the chief source of Molière's \"École des maris\".\n\nThe \"Fiesta que se hizo en Aranjuez\" and \"Querer por solo querer\" were translated into English by Sir Richard Fanshawe, afterwards ambassador at Madrid, in a posthumous volume published in 1671.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2309812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309812", "title": "CHOZ-FM", "text": "CHOZ-FM\n\nCHOZ-FM is a Canadian radio station based in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. Its main St. John's transmitter broadcasts at 94.7 MHz, with additional transmitters located throughout the island. The station, known as \"OZFM\", is one of the various media properties of the Stirling family; this includes local television station CJON-DT.\n\nCHOZ-FM launched on June 15, 1977 at 93.9 FM, soon after Geoff Stirling sold his interest in what is now CJYQ. It was originally a full-time rock station known as \"Radio OZ, The Rock Of The Rock\". It eventually transitioned to a combination CHR/Classic rock format under the \"OZFM\" brand; nonetheless it kept \"The Rock Of The Rock\" slogan.\n\nOn August 1, 1984, CHOZ was approved to move to 94.7 FM.\n\nDuring most of the 1990s it was the most popular FM radio station, both in the province and in the core St. John's market. The station's success was driven largely by the strength of its eclectic morning show, \"The Dawn Patrol\", with Randy Snow, Deborah Birmingham and Larry Jay.\n\nYet by the early 2000s its newly strengthened competitor Newcap Radio had begun to cause a significant effect, particularly in St. John's. Already the owner of the city's dominant AM radio station VOCM, Newcap effectively split CHOZ's market by converting VOCM-FM (and several other stations across the province) to classic rock, and soon after CKIX-FM to contemporary hits. Another strong contender, Coast Broadcasting's adult contemporary station CKSJ-FM, launched in 2004.\n\nBut since CKSJ and CKIX only operated in the St. John's area, CHOZ-FM was now in the problematic situation of competing primarily with female-skewing FM stations in its largest market, and with a single male-skewing FM competitor in the rest of the province.\n\nCHOZ-FM can still boast having the largest audience of any FM radio station in the province, largely because it is the only station with a province-wide network of transmitters, all carrying identical programming, which can therefore be accumulated for ratings purposes as a single station. In contrast, other provincial radio services such as CBC Radio One, VOCM and K-Rock are made up of separate local stations with some unique programming, while several stations operate only in the immediate St. John's area.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, Snow left the Dawn Patrol to join CKIX-FM to host his own morning show. His replacement was Brian O'Connell, who left the VOCM to join CHOZ-FM.\n\nIn April 2007, O'Connell took over as station manager for the OZFM Network and host of the daily \"Electric Lunch\" program. Then, O'Connell left CHOZ-FM and now works with Stingray Radio hosting afternoons. OZFM staff announcer Paul Kinsman was O'Connell's on air replacement, joining long time Dawn Patrol veterans Birmingham and Jay.\nOn August 14, 2009, CHOZ-FM changed its format to mainstream rock/Classic rock from hot adult contemporary, forcing rival CKIX-FM taking the hot adult contemporary format, but continue to report on the Mediabase/Nielsen BDS Canadian top 40 panel.\n\nOn January 2, 2012, CHOZ flipped back to hot adult contemporary, with a new slogan \"Today's Best Music\". This ended the use of their longtime slogan \"The Rock of the Rock\". The station also resurrected their longtime heart-rainbow logo, that the station used from the late 1980s to 2007. The following month, the station surfaced on the Mediabase Canadian hot AC panel.\n\nIn August 2012, Kinsman and Jay left the Dawn Patrol, which was renamed \"The Morning Rush\" and featured a new host, Robert Shawn, alongside the only remaining original host Birmingham. In January 2013, the pair were joined by their former behind the scenes producer, Laura Woodworth. Birmingham left the station in January 2014 and her replacement on the Morning Rush was Stephanie O'Brien, previously with VOCM-FM.\n\nIn November 2014, Woodworth left CHOZ and now resides in Prince Edward Island. Shawn and O'Brien continued to host the Morning Rush until Shawn switched places with Stephen Lethbridge in July 2015. The Morning Rush was then renamed \"The OZFM Rush\". Lethbridge and O'Brien hosted without a third host until Hugh Campbell joined them in December 2015.\n\nOn July 31, 2016, O'Brien uploaded a video to Facebook of her telling her parents that she is pregnant. O'Brien gave birth to her daughter, Charlie, on December 30, 2016. Shannell Lewis co-hosted the OZFM Rush with Lethbridge and Campbell throughout 2017 and early 2018. As of February 2018, O'Brien is back from her maternity leave.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, Snow returned to CHOZ after 16 years with CKIX-FM, As a result, the OZFM Rush became \"The Morning Jam\" with Snow joining O'Brien as the new host, replacing Lethbridge and Campbell. In addition, CHOZ tweaked its format to playing a mix of hits from the 1990s to today. The station is now known as \"Newfoundland’s Music Mix, The New OZFM\".\n\nOn Sunday mornings, the station plays the \"Jigs and Reels Show\" hosted by Danielle Butt, featuring local Newfoundland music.\n\nIn January 2011, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council admonished CHOZ-FM for playing the unedited version of Dire Straits' \"Money for Nothing\", following a complaint from a listener that stated that the song contained the word \"faggot\", a slur for a homosexual person. Even though the song has won numerous awards and has been played countless times on Canadian radio, the CBSC felt that the unedited version has become unacceptable for airplay, as the term \"faggot\", which was once an acceptable term, has since become an unacceptable slur. In response to the ruling, at least two stations, CIRK-FM in Edmonton and CFRQ-FM in Halifax, played the unedited version of \"Money for Nothing\" repeatedly for one hour out of protest. On January 21, 2011, the CRTC asked the CBSC for a review on the ban, in response to the public outcry against the CBSC's actions; the regulator requested the CBSC to appoint a nationwide panel to review the case, as the decision on the ban was reviewed by a regional panel for the Maritimes and Newfoundland.\n\nOn August 31, the CBSC found the slur to be inappropriate; however, due to considerations in regard to its use in context, the CBSC has left it up to the stations to decide whether or not to censor the song. Most of the CBSC panelists thought the slur was inappropriate, but it was used only in a satirical, non-hateful manner.\n\nCJMY and CKMY were previously known as CKCV-FM and CHOS-FM respectively, up to at least 2002. The changes were apparently made to reserve appropriate call signs for \"My FM\", Newfoundland Broadcasting's proposal for a second FM service, which went before the CRTC later that same year. (The licence in question eventually went to a different company as Coast 101.1.)\n\nIn 1997, CHOZ-FM added a rebroadcaster at Stockholm, Saskatchewan with the callsign CFZY-FM; the low-powered repeater is locally owned by Jody Herperger. The station was decommissioned in 2007.\n\nIn 1998, CHOZ-FM added a rebroadcaster at Kuujjuaq, Quebec with the callsign VF2321, owned by Société Kuujjuamiut.\n\nOn November 30, 2012, the stations rebroadcaster at Red Rocks, CKSS-FM 96.9, had closed; the station has cited the age of the tower and the costs of the upkeep. CHOZ, however, announced plans to reactivate it from another location, pending approval from the CRTC. As of 2018 CRTC approval has never been granted. CHOZ also originally planned to also temporarily close CIOS on the same day, but had second thoughts in doing so, and opted to keep it open from the same location instead. The application to move the Stephenville transmitter to a new location has been approved on November 8, 2013.\n\nOn September 15, 2015, the CRTC approved a new transmitter for a new CHOZ-FM rebroadcaster in Gander, CFAZ-FM 97.7, with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 2,800 watts (effective height of antenna above average terrain of 137.4 metres). The new transmitter would resolve coverage problems within the Gander area from its Grand Falls-Windsor outlet CKMY, which offered fringe reception in Gander. CFAZ began broadcasting on August 9, 2016.\n\nCHOZ-FM is simulcast across Canada on Bell TV satellite channel 951, locally on Rogers Cable channel 925, and in the St. John's area on subchannel 21.2 of CJON-DT.\n\n"}

It was established in 1906 and was originally a mixed secondary school, it later became Itchen Grammar School under the reforms of the Butler Education Act. It became its present state following further reform in the 1980s.\n\nItchen College opened on 6 October 1906 as a Pupil Teacher's Centre in Raymond Lodge, Bridge Road, Woolston. It later moved to the first floor of Porchester Road Elementary School (which later became Woolston Secondary School for Boys), Woolston, in 1916.\n\nPupils started at the centre at age 13 and took the Cambridge Junior Local Examination after completing a two-year course. If they passed the exam, they could go on to become pupil teachers before moving on to teacher training college.\n\nThe first permanent Principal of the centre was Edith North, who held the position until 1916. She was succeeded by Miss G.V. Cook, who remained Headmistress until 1918, when she was promoted to a larger school in East London. A temporary Headmistress, Mrs Macrae-Gibson, took over until it was decided that a Headmaster should be appointed. The person appointed was Mr F.J. Hemmings, in 1919.\n\nIn 1908, the local Board of Education called for improved secondary education facilities. A report titled 'Woolston New Secondary School' was drafted up by the Director of Education, recommending a school to accommodate 170 children.\n\nPlans for a new building on a larger site were then drawn up, but financial difficulties meant that the land at Middle Road (the college's current site) was not bought until 1912. The land was rough and covered with gorse, bracken, and blackberry bushes, and World War I broke out before work could start to clear it.\n\nThe plans for a new school were shelved during the war and it wasn't until 1919 that they were reconsidered. Work at erecting temporary structures to house the new influx of post-war students was slow, however, and the centre couldn't relocate until 1921.\n\nBy this time, the centre had 228 students on roll and was full to capacity, having to turn students away due to lack of room.\n\nIn 1921, Itchen Pupil Teacher's Centre became Itchen Coeducational Secondary School, moving into temporary huts on the current Middle Road site.\n\nThe foundation stone for the present building in Middle Road was laid in December 1925, but the school wasn't finished until 1938.\n\nThe temporary buildings consisted of: a science laboratory; a workshop for woodwork and metalwork; a housecraft room; an assembly room that doubled as art and physics rooms; two staff rooms; and a Headmaster's room. The school had to keep using four rooms at the Porchester Road School, as the temporary buildings at Middle Road couldn't accommodate the large number of pupils. If pupils or staff needed to travel from one end of the school to another, it was a journey of one and a half miles.\n\nIn 1919, Mr Hemmings started an annual 'prize distribution' and 'speech day'. This took place every July, and is still a tradition that the current Itchen College does today with their annual 'Celebration Event'.\n\nMr Hemmings was transferred to Taunton's School in 1924 and was replaced in 1925 by Mr. E. Cotemann, with the role named as 'principal'.\n\nBuilding work to complete the permanent buildings had all but stopped and in 1929 the Board of Education considered the move to complete them and improve the inadequate temporary facilities. However, before the completion plans had been drawn up, fire broke out on 8 December 1930. The Assembly Hall and Art room were completely destroyed, but the temporary huts escaped relatively unscathed. A temporary hall was put up quickly by the Board, but support for new facilities at Itchen languished and was given to two other secondary schools who were deemed to have a greater need for them - King Edward VI School, and the Girls' Grammar School.\n\nIn 1934, Itchen Secondary School was given four new permanent classrooms and the temporary huts were finally replaced with a permanent structure. Principal Cotemann was still fighting for plans to be approved, demanding a gymnasium in 1935. The Board agreed in 1936 and, in 1937, work not only started on the gymnasium, but also on an entire new West Wing. This included an assembly hall (including stage), gymnasium, dining room and kitchen. An additional art room, craft room, Prefect's room, library, and senior mistresses' room were added shortly after.\n\nWork on the school was finally completed in 1938, thirteen years after it began.\n\nWhen World War II broke out in 1939, the government's plans to evacuate children from danger areas to safer parts of the country were put into effect. Because of Southampton's location on the south coast and its status as a large port city, it was an important target for the Luftwaffe (see Southampton Blitz). Because of this risk, the city's children were among those covered by the government's plans.\n\nOn 1 September 1939, half of Itchen Secondary School's 520 pupils evacuated, the school combining with Andover Grammar School. Upon arrival, staff and senior boys dug air raid shelters before settling into life outside of Southampton.\n\nAndover Grammar School had their lessons in the mornings while Itchen carried out theirs in the afternoon and evenings, generally between 13:30 and 17:30, and allowed alternate Saturday mornings off. This schedule posed difficulties for the students, as classrooms were full of stale air and they had to conduct lessons using gas lamps with blackout curtains up at the windows.\n\nFinding accommodation was also difficult. Andover was also housing refugees from London so the town rapidly filled up. School staff had to undertake fire-watching duties.\n\nItchen's new buildings were put to use during the war, being turned into an A.R.P. Post and Casualty Station with medical services. In 1940, French troops who had escaped Dunkirk, were given tea and sandwiches by the WRVS through the window of the Domestic Science room. A British restaurant was later established in the school's dining hall.\n\nItchen Secondary School's evacuation ended in December 1944 with the pupils returning to the Southampton site after spending 16 terms studying at Andover.\n\nUpon returning to the Southampton site, Itchen Secondary School had more problems to face. Many staff members had left or retired during the war and some of the school buildings were still occupied. The A.R.P. Post and Casualty Station with medical services remained in the gymnasium until 1948, and the British Restaurant remained until sometime after that.\n\nThe exterior of the school had suffered damage. The metal railings surrounding the grounds had been removed for scrap-iron during the war effort and the field and cricket pitch had been damaged. All attempts to repair the field and cricket pitch kept failing, as without fencing, people repeatedly trampled and ruined the new turf that had been laid. Eventually the field and cricket pitch were repaired to their pre-war condition.\n\nThere was an influx of students post-war, with pupil numbers doubling, mostly due to the Butler Education Act in 1944, which abolished grammar school fees in order to provide secondary school education for all.\n\nItchen Secondary School became a Grammar School in 1946 in order to accommodate the rising pupil numbers.\n\nThere were attempts to make the always coeducational school single-sex (girls only) during the 1950s but both the school and the Old Issonians Association were opposed to the idea. In 1956, Charles Thompson (Headmaster of Itchen Grammar School 1950-1971) wrote: “The school’s greatest source of strength is to be found in the fact that it is coeducational. From the earliest days of the secondary school, when coeducation was far less common than it is now, social activities involving both boys and girls were a readily accepted feature of the school.”\n\nItchen Grammar School thrived under Charles Thompson's twenty-one years of leadership and some of the reforms he implemented at the school were: banning the use of the cane; abolishing single-sex staff rooms; building the school swimming pool and observatory; and replacing the ‘temporary’ huts. The swimming pool was built using money raised during the 1956 Jubilee Celebrations and was the first school swimming pool in Southampton. With the huts demolished, long-awaited science laboratories were built in 1964, improving teaching as well as student satisfaction. These reforms and extensions brought Itchen Grammar School up to then-current standards.\n\nThe largest extension – designed by architects Messr Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners of London - saw all classrooms moved to the first and second floors, with the open-plan student areas on the ground floor, opening up to the playing fields. New facilities within the extension included: science laboratories; needlework and housecraft rooms; and geography classrooms with a terrace that linked them to the observatory on the roof.\n\nIn 1966 there was debate in the Southampton Education Committee about turning to a comprehensive education system. The Committee favoured the introduction of Sixth Form Colleges and three were selected as initial options for Southampton: Richard Taunton's Grammar School; the Girl's Grammar School; and Itchen Grammar School, the latter being the only coeducational Sixth Form College in Southampton.\n\nPhilip Vennis was appointed as Principal of the new Itchen Sixth Form College in 1971 and remained until his retirement in 1988. He was a strong advocate for open access, stating: \n\nThis ideology forms part of the present-day mission at Itchen Sixth Form College, providing inclusive further education for all.\n\nStudents are mainly from areas of Southampton, east of the River Itchen and along the M27 corridor towards Fareham. The college's extensive runs an extensive bus service, and is close enough to Sholing Railway Station to allowi access from all over Hampshire.\n\nInternational students make up 10% of the total student body. \n\nFull-time students study a wide range of courses including vocational, GCSEs, BTECs, and A Levels. A large number of subjects are supported by the college's Academy of Sport, High Performance Academy (for gifted and talented students), and the recently launched Creative Arts Academy, which offers specialised training and extra opportunities for students to further their skills through extra-curricular classes and trips. The college also offers a range of Adult Education courses.\n\nThe college was inspected in 2017 and in 2018 and on both occasions judged as Requiring Improvement.\n\nThe sports courses that Itchen College offers are supported by the college's Academy of Sport. The Academy provides students with the opportunity to pursue sports alongside their studies by offering specialist coaching. It allows students to study further qualifications in sport, such as Fitness Instructor awards, and helps students secure higher education places in top sporting institutions around the world, particularly in the United States.\n\nThe Academy currently offers expert coaching in:\n\nNewly launched in 2015, the Creative Arts Academy provides students on creative courses with extra support and opportunities to enhance their skills. Unlike the Academy of Sport, which is open to all students, this Academy is exclusive to those students on creative courses.\n\nStudents who are part of this Academy have access to work placements in the Creative Industries, frequent trips to both national and international destinations (for example, New York City), and help putting together a creative portfolio ready for when they enter the workplace.\n\nThe college collaborates with local Higher Education institutions, like the nearby Southampton Solent University, to help students build their skills and experience.\n\nStudents also have access to the college's new Performing Arts building.\n\nCourses included within the Creative Arts Academy are:\n\nThe High Performance Academy is for students who have been identified as gifted and talented by their previous school. It provides tailored support for students wanting to achieve the highest grades in their A Levels.\n\nTo be eligible, students need to have an average GCSE score of 6.5. They can also be referred to the Academy by their teachers when they reach Itchen College.\n\nThe five elements to the High Performance Academy are:\nStudents in the High Performance Academy have gone on to secure places at universities all over the world, including Oxbridge.\n\nInternational students are offered English as a Foreign Language courses; they stay with local Southampton families, and are referred to as Homestays. \n\nDespite being primarily for 16-19-year-old school leavers, Itchen Sixth Form College offers adult education classes for students over 19. These include: Access to Higher Education; teacher training courses; English, Maths, and Science courses; Accountancy qualifications; and Childcare, Health and Social Care courses.\n\nItchen Sixth Form College runs an award-winning in-house radio station called Itchen Radio. It broadcasts once a week through local Southampton radio station Unity 101.\n\nThe radio station is run by a team of 15 students, with the group changing every academic year, on media and journalism courses and has been broadcasting for ten years. Its unofficial mascot is a black horse.\n\nOn air at least three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), regular shows include: Half Time Oranges (sports news); international music; interviews with members of staff, politicians, and local celebrities (e.g. Matt Le Tissier); and discussions about current affairs.\n\nThere are a range of clubs and societies.\n\nCurrent clubs include:\n\nPublished every academic term, the Itchen College News (ICoN) magazine features articles about the achievements and successes of Itchen College's students, as well as news about what is coming up for Itchen over the following months.\n\nIn 1920, Itchen Pupil Teacher's Centre headmaster Mr Hemmings started up the 'Old Students Association'. It was formed for alumni to keep in touch with the centre and was ideally supposed to allow them to continue to participate with the centre.\n\nIt wasn't until after World War II that the 'Old Students Association' became active. Renamed the 'Old Issonians Association' by Principal Cotemann after the evacuation ended, the name was taken from the school's then current initials ('I.S.S. - Itchen Secondary School).\n\nThe Association became active with sporting (in particular football and hockey), dramatic, and social activities for past pupils. In 1939 the association had had over a hundred members and this reached over 300 post-1945. The number continued to soar and in 1956, during the Jubilee celebrations, membership reached 600.\n\nUnfortunately, with the college becoming a sixth form, membership began to fall into decline. By 1980 it had dwindled to just 100 alumni.\n\nAs of 2005, the Old Issonians Association website only lists 5 members and states that the Association \"is likely to be winding up due to lack of interest.\" With the website not having been updated since 2005, it is assumed that the Old Issonians Association is no longer running.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2309832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309832", "title": "Tallgrass Prairie Preserve", "text": "Tallgrass Prairie Preserve\n\nThe Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, located in Osage County, Oklahoma near Foraker, Oklahoma, is owned and managed by The Nature Conservancy. It is protected as the largest tract of remaining tallgrass prairie in the world. The preserve contains owned by the Conservancy and another leased in what was the original tallgrass region of the Great Plains that stretched from Texas to Manitoba.\n\nThe preserve is located at the southern end of the Flint Hills, also known as the Osage Hills. The rocky, rolling prairie stretches from northern Kansas into Oklahoma. Exposed limestone formations make cultivation difficult, and thus the Flint Hills have survived much as they were when they were a hunting ground for area tribes such as the Wichita, Osage, and Kaw. The region is called “The Osage” by Oklahomans, referring to the name of the Native American tribe that occupied this territory and to the county named for them. Pilots call The Osage the “Black Hole” when flying over it at night because it is so lightly populated.\nPrior to its purchase by the Nature Conservancy in 1989, much of the preserve was within the boundaries of the Barnard Ranch; it had been part of the Chapman-Barnard ranch of . The foreman of the Chapman-Barnard ranch, Ben Johnson, Sr. was a rodeo champion. His son, also a rodeo champion, was Ben Johnson, Jr., an actor who appeared in more than 300 movies and won an Oscar for his role in \"The Last Picture Show\".\n\nThe preserve is bisected by the well-timbered Salt Creek and its tributaries. The eastern portion of the preserve is in the Cross Timbers, a north-south running belt of tangled oak forests that were a major impediment to early travelers heading west. About 10 percent of the preserve is forested and the remainder is tallgrass prairie; the grasses of several species here can grow tall.\n\nThe tallgrass prairie owes its existence to fire, whether caused by lightning or manmade. Without fire, the prairie quickly becomes brushland. The Native Americans were aware of this and burned the prairie regularly to nurture new growth of succulent grasses and to kill intrusive trees and shrubs. The Nature Conservancy has continued this practice with a process called “patch burning,” in which about one-third of the prairie is burned each year. This process has proven beneficial not only in providing grazing for bison and cattle, but also for the habitat of the threatened greater prairie chickens, which also inhabit the preserve in small numbers.\n\nBison are the most prominent attraction of the preserve. In 1993, Oklahoma oilman Kenneth Adams donated 300 bison to the preserve. By 2000, the herd had increased to 1,200. The herd now numbers more than 2,500 and grazes of mostly open range. Bison are rounded up each fall and the excess numbers sold. Cattle are grazed on . The preserve supports 755 plant species, many unique to the tallgrass prairie, and more than 300 bird species. Forest trees include several species of oak, cottonwoods, ash, red cedar, elm, sycamore, and others.\n\nThe Tallgrass Prairie Preserve is on what used to be the Osage Indian Reservation. When forced to agree to household allotments of communal land, the Osage retained sub-surface mineral rights on all their former lands. Members of the nation have had what are known as headrights to a portion of this communal resource and are paid a portion of leasing revenues for mineral production. In the early 20th century, the discovery of petroleum on their land made the Osage the richest people per capita in the world in the 1920s and 1930s. But they were subject to harassment, manipulation, fraud and murder in what was known as a 'Reign of Terror' as whites tried to gain control of family members' headrights. While oil production has declined, there are still more than 100 producing oil wells on the preserve, among which the bison graze.\n\nThe preserve is home to numerous interesting invertebrates species. In addition to the many species of butterflies and moths that feed and host on the flowering plant biodiversity found there, the prairie mole cricket (\"Gryllotalpa major\") is a rare insect species found on the preserve. Males congregate in leks in large numbers in the spring months (April–May) to produce loud choruses from calling burrows to attract flying females. In the summer months, the preserve serves as habitat for the endangered American burying beetle (\"Nicrophorus americanus\"), which plays an important role in nutrient cycling.\n\n Pawhuska, Oklahoma, is the nearest large town. The Osage Nation has its headquarters here. The preserve may also be entered near Foraker, Oklahoma, and Hewins, Kansas. The Tallgrass Prairie Preserve is open every day from dawn to dusk. There is no admission charge. \n\nThe headquarters of the Chapman-Barnard ranch has been converted into a visitor center with restrooms, a gift shop, and the restored bunkhouse in which the cowboys lived. The main building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NR 01000208). The gift shop is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m from March to mid-November. Oklahoma State University has a research station at the visitor center.\n\nNear Salt Creek are two hiking trails. One is a short nature trail; the other is a 2-mile (3 km) trail that climbs to overlooks over the creek and through the riparian forest. Frequently, bison are seen just across the fence that separates the hiking area from grazing areas. White-tailed deer are abundant in the wooded areas.\n\nThe principal activity for the 10,000 visitors who annually come to the preserve is driving the many dirt roads to observe the numerous bison. Often hundreds of bison may be seen near – and sometimes blocking – the roads. Scenic turnouts along the roads provide broad vistas of the rolling prairie, emerald green in spring, tall and brown in fall, and dotted with wildflowers in the summer.\n\nNoted Osage author John Joseph Mathews had a small cabin in the Osage Hills, where he did much of his writing. At his request, he was buried near his cabin. About 2014 the Nature Conservancy of Oklahoma bought the plot including his cabin and gravesite, and have added it to the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve. The cabin will be preserved and the public will be allowed limited access.\n\n"}

A new village, Port Lions (named for the Lions Club who helped construct it), was constructed to house the tribe, but many moved on to Kodiak or elsewhere in the United States or Canada.\n\nThe history of the Alutiiq goes back more than 7,500 years in the Kodiak Archipelago, but during the late 18th century, the Russian-American Company pressed many of the men of the islands in the area into service hunting otter. This mistreatment and a smallpox epidemic in 1837 lead to increased protections from Russia and the imposition of a system of legislated villages, one of which was Afognak.\n\nThe village of Afognak was actually a combination of two former villages known simply as \"Russian Town\" and \"Aleut Town\", formed through continual contact between the two groups.\n\nMany Native traditions were cast aside in 1867 when Alaska was purchased by the United States.\n\nDuring the period from the purchase of Alaska through its becoming a state in 1959 and until the earthquake in 1964, the quality of life was much lower for the Village of Afognak. Commercial fishing interfered with local sustenance and employment conditions were often far less than ideal.\n\nIn 1971 the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act resulted in the formation of thirteen regional corporations and a number of \"\"Native Village Corporations\"\" which were recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as \"tribal entities\". The Native Village of Afognak is one such officially designated tribe. The regional Alaska Native Corporation is Koniag, Inc. Many members of the Native Village of Afognak also hold shares in one of the region's village corporations, Afognak Native Corporation. Koniag, Inc. and Afognak Native Corporation are distinct legal entities.\n\nThe tribal council of the Native Village of Afognak consists of seven elected members who sit for three year terms. The council is the official governing body of the tribe as well as managing cultural and land resources and preserving the cultural traditions of the Alutiiq.\n\nIn 1994, the Afognak Native Corporation began to build tourism by involving visitors in the archaeological excavation of the old Afognak island village of Ag’waneq in a program called \"\"Dig Afognak\"\". In 1998 the Bureau of Indian Affairs issued a grant to fund the collection and preservation of historic and prehistoric data from the dig and from interviews with Elders of the community.\n\n\n"}

He is considered one of Germany's most often performed contemporary composers.\n\nMatthus attended secondary school in Rheinsberg, followed by studies at the Hochschule für Musik \"Hanns Eisler\" in Berlin. After graduating, he continued his studies in composition with Rudolf Wagner-Régeny and Hanns Eisler, and was shortly thereafter made the youngest composer in residence in the history of the Komische Oper Berlin by Walter Felsenstein. Matthus has written more than a dozen stage works. The opera \"Die Weise von Liebe und Tod des Cornets Christoph Rilke\" (\"Cornet Christoph Rilke's song of love and death \") after Rainer Maria Rilke was completed in 1983, first performed in Dresden in 1985, performed also for example by the Glyndebourne Touring Opera in 1993. The opera \"Graf Mirabeau\" (1987–88) is set during the French Revolution. It was commissioned for the 200th anniversary of Bastille Day and enjoyed simultaneous productions in both East and West Germany as well as Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union and France. The opera has also been recorded by the Berlin State Opera. Other opera recordings include his Old Testament-based \"opera vision\" \"Judith\" (1984) by the Komische Oper Berlin and his \"Der letzte Schuss\" with the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra. In 2003 he composed music for both a ballet and an opera adaptation of Michael Ende's \"The Neverending Story\".\n\nMatthus has also been a prolific composer of works for orchestra as well as chamber and recital compositions. He has enjoyed a close working relationship with conductor Kurt Masur who has presented many world premieres of his music, including what Matthus has called \"the commission of my life,\" a \"Te Deum\" for the reconsecration of the Dresden Frauenkirche, broadcast live 11 November 2005. His works are featured on more than twenty recordings by several of Germany's leading symphony orchestras and chamber music ensembles.\n\nMatthus has been the Artistic Director of the Kammeroper Rheinsberg since 1991. He is also the founder and director of the Rheinsberg Music Festival and an honorary citizen of the city of Rheinsberg.\n\nOn 25 January 2009, Leon Botstein and the American Symphony Orchestra presented the New York premiere performance of Matthus's \"Responso,\" a four-movement symphony written in 1977.\n\n\n"}

He is known primarily for his horror comedies, though he would prefer to be classified as an \"exploitation\" filmmaker (rather than horror). \"I never felt that I made ‘horror films’, he has said. \"I always felt that I made exploitation films. Exploitation films have an attitude more than anything – an attitude that you don’t find with mainstream Hollywood productions. They’re a little ruder, a little raunchier, they deal with material people don’t usually touch on, whether it’s sex or drugs or rock and roll.\"\n\nHenenlotter's films were inspired by the exploitation and sexploitation films he loved, the kind which played on 42nd Street in New York City in the 1960s and 1970s. His films are low-budget and filled with gore and special effects. They are considered by many to be B-movies, but they also turn the conventions of these films upon themselves. Although many of his films are somewhat obscure, his most well-known are \"Basket Case\", \"Brain Damage\" and \"Frankenhooker\".\n\nFollowing \"\", Henenlotter became deeply involved in the release slate of the specialty video releasing outfit Something Weird Video; he has also been instrumental in rescuing many low-budget sexploitation and exploitation films from being destroyed, including the camp classic \"The Curious Dr. Humpp\" (1971). Many of these works have been released under Something Weird's specialty logo \"Frank Henenlotter's Sexy Shockers.\"\n\nDuring the 16 years following \"BC 3,\" a number of Henenlotter feature projects came close to production, including \"Sick in the Head,\" Henenlotter's first script collaboration with R.A. the Rugged Man, at one point scheduled to be produced under the aegis of Fangoria Magazine; but, coincidental with the general economic downturn, financing evaporated. Henenlotter has also noted the conflicts he had with producers over the film, who forced the filmmaker to walk after urging him to reedit his script so it would be \"more like \"Saw\".\" R.A. subsequently was able to find a new deal and very modest financing through his music industry contacts, so \"Bad Biology\" was conceived to be shot for an extremely low budget, for extremely limited, unrated theatrical play, and subsequent video release. Though only attendees at film festivals and special film events have had the opportunity to see the film (shot in traditional 35mm at Henenlotter's insistence) projected in a theater, Henenlotter claims the low budget, independent financing and the decision to forgo the ratings process allowed him a level of freedom he has been missing since his earliest films. \"Bad Biology\" was scheduled for video release in January 2010 by Media Blasters. Henenlotter appeared as himself in the documentary film \"Herschell Gordon Lewis – The Godfather of Gore\" and narrated the film on the 2010 FanTasia. In issue #304 Frank and comic artist Joshua Emerick started the Basket Case comic strip for Fangoria. The three panel strip runs in each issue.\n\nHenenlotter appeared in the 2013 documentary film \"Rewind This!\", about the impact of VHS on the film industry and home video. He also appeared with the film's director, Josh Johnson, when it screened at film festivals such as the Telluride Horror Show. In 2014, he directed \"Chasing Banksy\", which was screened with a visit of Henenlotter at New York City Forbidden Planet.\n\n"}

It's Me, Jesus\" is the sixteenth and penultimate episode of the third season of the animated television series \"South Park\". It was originally broadcast on December 29, 1999. The episode's title and the theme of menstruation was inspired by the book \"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.\"\n\nAs the year 2000 is approaching, Cartman realizes blood is coming out of his anus, leading him to believe he is experiencing his first period and thus commencing puberty. He makes fun of the other boys for not hitting puberty yet, unaware that his bleeding is caused by a minor stomach infection that has spread across South Park, and that it can be cured with antibiotics. Kenny later contracts the same ailment, and Kyle, not wanting to be left out, pretends he is also afflicted. The boys consequently abandon Stan and leave him out of their next mission, believing he is less mature for not having had his period.\n\nMeanwhile, the people of the world flock around Jesus' house, excited about the new millennium and saying that, at the year 2000, Jesus' father should make an appearance. Jesus contacts his father and tells him about his potential resurgence in popularity, but God (unseen in their conversation) refuses to show up because mankind is not ready. Jesus, wanting to still satisfy the people, books Rod Stewart to play a New Year's Eve concert in Las Vegas; everybody decides to go, because a rumor persists that God will show up.\n\nStan, meanwhile, prays for his period, but doesn't get it, so he visits Dr. Mephesto and gets a bottle of hormone pills. Using them causes Stan to grow a beard, have a deeper voice, and develop a pair of breasts, but still no \"period.\" Afterwards, Kenny suddenly bursts from inside out and dies. At the hospital, they discover the reason: Kenny had shoved a tampon up his rectum. The doctor expresses concern that \"the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something.\"\n\nThe crowd in Las Vegas for the New Year's concert is enraged upon seeing Rod Stewart (portrayed here as very old and incontinent) and they turn against Jesus. With them preparing to crucify him again, Stan asks Jesus why God does not answer his prayers, and Jesus explains that, if God does everything for you, then your existence has no real purpose. Jesus realizes that this was God's message: Jesus had to figure his \"own\" way to get people to follow him. And just as he realizes this, God arrives.\n\nAfter the crowd's initial shock over God's appearance (distinctly unlike traditional depictions of God), God offers the people the chance to ask one question. The crowd plans to ask the meaning of life or existence, but before anyone else can ask, Stan comes up and asks why he hasn't gotten his period. God explains that boys don't get periods, and tells the truth: that Cartman and Kenny are affected by the colon infection and Kyle was lying to fit in with them. God explains to Stan that he will never get a period (because he is male), but he will hit puberty when the time is right. He then returns to Heaven, saying he will answer another question in the year 4000. Stan is satisfied by this, and joyfully starts singing \"Auld Lang Syne\", but the angry crowd attacks him for wasting their chance to ask God a profoundly important question, as the credits roll.\n\nIn the DVD commentary for the episode, Trey Parker and Matt Stone said that Comedy Central wanted them to produce this episode for the new millennium as every other show was producing Y2K episodes, despite that the season had ended with the prior episode Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics. Initially, Trey Parker intended for God to look like somewhat a mixture of a cat and a hippo.\n\nThis was the first episode to feature Eliza Schneider and Mona Marshall providing the voices for the female characters following Mary Kay Bergman's death. Schneider would continue to voice her roles until Season 7 (replaced with April Stewart), and Marshall continues to be a part of the show's cast.\n\n"}

Arsenates are salts or esters of arsenic acid.\nThe arsenic atom in arsenate has a valency of 5 and is also known as pentavalent arsenic or As(V).\nArsenate resembles phosphate in many respects, since arsenic and phosphorus occur in the same group (column) of the periodic table. \nArsenates are moderate oxidizers, with an electrode potential of +0.56 V for reduction to arsenites.\n\nArsenates occur naturally in a variety of minerals. Those minerals may contain hydrated or anhydrous arsenates. Unlike phosphates, arsenates are not lost from a mineral during weathering. Examples of arsenate-containing minerals include adamite, alarsite, annabergite, erythrite and legrandite. Where two arsenate ions are required to balance the charge in a formula, it is called diarsenate for example trizinc diarsenate, Zn(AsO).\n\nThe word arsenate is derived from arsenic acid, HAsO. This moderately strong acid converts to dihydrogen arsenate (), hydrogen arsenate (), and arsenate (), depending on pH. The quantitative relationship between these species is defined by the acid dissociation constants:\n\nThese values are similar to those of the hydrogen phosphates. Hydrogen arsenate and dihydrogen arsenate predominate in aqueous solution near neutral pH.\n\nArsenate can replace inorganic phosphate in the step of glycolysis that produces 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This yields 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate instead, which is unstable and quickly hydrolyzes, forming the next intermediate in the pathway, 3-phosphoglycerate. Therefore, glycolysis proceeds, but the ATP molecule that would be generated from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is lost – arsenate is an uncoupler of glycolysis, explaining its toxicity.\n\nAs with other arsenic compounds, arsenite binds to lipoic acid, inhibiting the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, blocking the Krebs cycle and therefore resulting in further loss of ATP.\n"}

It commemorates the 1917 Battle of Vimy Ridge during the First World War. The march is usually played on special occasions which commemorate the battle, such as Vimy Ridge Day. Vimy Ridge serves as the official regimental marchpast for the 1st Canadian Division.\n\nThe march was used by the Massed Bands of the British Household Division as the second neutral quick march during the Trooping the Colour ceremony in 2014.

Many local students attend these schools to learn the language of the international school and to obtain qualifications for employment or higher education in a foreign country.\nThe first international schools were founded in the latter half of the 19th century in countries such as Japan, Switzerland and Turkey. Early international schools were set up for families who travelled, like children of personnel of international companies, international organisations, non-governmental organisations (NGO), and embassy staff. The schools were established with the people and organisations having large interests in the hosting nation: for instance, American diplomats and missionaries often set up schools to educate their children; children of American military and army families often attended Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS); French diplomats and business families founded similar schools based on the French curriculum.\n\nIn April 2007 there were 4,179 English-speaking international schools, which was expected to set to rise with globalisation. In New Delhi worldwide entries for the University of Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) June 2009 examination session are up by almost 20% on the same session last year. The strong growth confirms the status of Cambridge IGCSE as the world's, and India's, most popular international curriculum for 14- to 16-year-olds, indicating that despite the global financial crises education is still a valued investment. International schooling allows children to become global citizens by providing a rigorous and comprehensive education with full immersion into multiple languages and cultures.\n\nAt a conference in Italy in 2009 the International Association of School Librarianship came up with a list of criteria for describing an international school, including:\n\nThe most common international schools represent Education in the United Kingdom, Education in the United States or are based on curricula specially designed for international schools such as the International General Certificate of Secondary Education or the IB Diploma Programme. These international curricula are committed to internationalism, developing the global citizen, providing an environment for optimal learning, and teaching in an international setting that fosters understanding, independence, interdependence, and cooperation.\n\nLike other schools, international schools teach language arts, mathematics, the sciences, humanities, the arts, physical education, information technology, and design technology. More recent developments specifically for primary school include the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) and International Primary Curriculum (IPC). There are currently 3063 schools offering the international baccalaureate curriculum in the world and over 1000 schools offering the IPC around the world.\n\nFor expatriate families, international schools allow some continuity in education and most prefer to stay in the same curriculum, especially for older children.\n\nThe United Nations International School (UNIS) was established in 1947 by a group of United Nations parents to promote an international education for their children, while preserving their diverse cultural heritages. The school was one of twelve schools who originally trialled the pilot International Baccalaureate Program and the school has offered it ever since. The school promotes the appreciation of the diversity of persons and cultures, provides an optimal environment for learning and teaching, and offers a global curriculum that inspires in its students the spirit and ideals of the United Nations Charter.\n\nFollowing the establishment of UNIS, three other international schools around the globe were opened with a direct connection to the United Nations: Vienna International School in 1959, United Nations International School of Hanoi in 1988 and NIST International School in 1992.\n\nThe best International Schools will be members of recognised associations. Parents can be reassured that these schools meet international accreditation standards. \n\nCOBIS is the Council of British International Schools. Members of COBIS are International Schools across the whole world offering a curriculum which is based on the British system. For older students, ages 14-16 years, this will be the IGCSEs. For 16-18 years, this will include the A Level programmes. They will also usually be accredited by a British Based inspection organisation and the inspection reports will be listed on the UK Government website. \n\nAcross the world, in addition to global associations such as COBIS, there are also regional international associations such as FOBISIA FOBISIA is the Federation of British International Schools in Asia. It provides opportunity for teacher training and also students to participate in FOBISIA competitions and workshops across the full range of subjects - Sports, Performing Arts, Model United Nations etc. \n\nAn international school teacher or educator is someone engaged in the education of pupils in schools other than their country of citizenship. The term generally refers to teachers who are teaching in private or independent schools (Savva,2013). While these schools are private there is an important distinction between private for-profit and private non-for profit schools (Savva, 2013).\n\nFaculty at international schools are usually from or certified by the standards of their country of origin.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions, the most common of which the international school requires a teacher trained specifically for an international syllabus or for teaching a foreign language rare to the international school's country of origin.\n\nHiring is frequently done at large international job fairs, such as the ones held by the Council of International Schools (CIS), where schools can interview and hire several teachers at once. There are also a handful of agencies which specialize in recruiting international teachers. Over the years it has become more difficult to recruit young international teachers, partly because of security concerns and the trend towards less attractive compensation packages. In some countries such as South Korea, recent visa changes have also made it more difficult to obtain both qualified and unqualified teachers.\n\nHannah Smith of \"The Guardian\" wrote in 2013 that many students of international schools move between countries and places constantly. Several reported that they feel they have no one place where they have roots or a background.\n\nISCResearch have identified (2018 presentation) that in 2017 there were 9,173 international schools, 4.96 million students, 458,000 Staff with this expected to approximately double by 2027 to 16,400 international schools, 10.6 million students, 952,000 Staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hurwitz, M.D., was a Virginia based pain management physician who was prosecuted and convicted by the United States Government in 2004 for excessively prescribing addictive opioid pain medication to patients, some of whom subsequently abused and redistributed their medications on the black market. Before his conviction, Hurwitz had had a series of running battles with the Virginia Board of Medicine which, in 2003 found fault with some of his prescriptions but also held that all were written \"in good faith\".\n\nWilliam E. Hurwitz is a graduate of Columbia College. He then spent a period at the Harvard University School of Education before attending Stanford University's Medical School. While at Stanford he also earned a Masters in Sociology. He served as a staff physician in Brazil with the Peace Corps upon completing his medical degree.\n\nIn 2004, Hurwitz was convicted of over 50 counts of distribution of narcotics originally sentenced to four 25-year sentences and forty-six 15-year sentences, all of which were to be served concurrently, and was fined $2 million (U.S.). During the prosecution of the first case, all of Hurwitz's property was seized.\n\nHurwitz maintains that he was duped by his patients, and that the enforcement tactics being applied in the War on Drugs unfairly target law-abiding doctors, leading to a situation where doctors must choose between providing compassionate care and accepting personal liability for what their patients do with prescribed medications.\n\nHis case has potentially serious ramifications among all practitioners of pain medicine, and is considered by many to be a drastic example of the overreach of anti-drug law enforcement efforts.\n\nHis conviction was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on August 22, 2006, due to errors by the trial judge that essentially prevented the jury from considering Hurwitz's defense — that he was prescribing the medication in good faith as part of the regular practice of medicine. Defended pro bono, his re-trial began on March 26, 2007 in federal district court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nOn April 27, 2007 jurors found William E. Hurwitz guilty of 16 counts of drug trafficking and determined that he prescribed massive quantities of medicine to patients in chronic pain. The 12-member jury acquitted Hurwitz on 17 other trafficking counts. District Judge Leonie Brinkema dismissed the remaining 12 counts. His two lead trial attorneys for the second trial were Lawrence Robbins and Richard Sauber, of Robbins, Russell, Englert, Orseck & Untereiner, and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, respectively.\n\nOn July 13, 2007 Judge Brinkema sentenced Hurwitz to four years and nine months. The judge said that most of Hurwitz's practice was legitimate medicine that saved patients' lives and that medical literature increasingly supports his theories on the propriety of massive drug doses to treat patients in chronic pain. \"An increasing body of respectable medical literature and expertise supports those types of high-dosage, opioid medications,\" the judge said.\n\nThe judge added that Hurwitz had undermined his own cause by ignoring that some patients were clearly drug dealers and Hurwitz admitted before sentencing that he had deceived himself about some patients who in retrospect were clearly criminals.\n\nHurwitz was imprisoned a total of four years and eight months. He then moved to Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n"}

His older siblings were: Luis de Mendoza y Pacheco, II Marquis de Mondejar, III Count Tendilla, governor of Granada; Antonio de Mendoza y Pacheco, first Viceroy of New Spain and later Peru; Bernardino de Mendoza y Pacheco, Captain of the Spanish Galleys most noted for the (temporary) victory over Tunis; Francisco de Mendoza y Pacheco, Bishop of Ubeda; and Maria Mendoza y Pacheco (Maria Pacheco), a leader of the 1519 Revolt of the Communeros. The Marquis of Santillana was his great-grandfather.\n\nOn leaving the University of Salamanca, Mendoza abandoned his intention of taking orders, served under Charles V in Italy, and attended lectures at the universities of Bologna, Padua and Rome. In 1537 he was sent to the Kingdom of England to arrange a marriage between Henry VIII and Christina of Denmark, the widowed Duchess of Milan, as well as a marriage between Prince Louis of Portugal and Mary Tudor. Despite the failure of his mission, he retained the confidence of the emperor, and in 1539 was appointed ambassador at Venice. During his years in Venice he built up his library, buying books printed by the Aldine Press and employing scribes to copy Greek manuscripts. He procured copies of the Greek manuscripts belonging to Cardinal Bessarion, and acquired other rare codices from the monastery of Mount Athos. The first printed Greek edition of the works of Josephus, based on texts from Mendoza's collection, was edited by the Flemish humanist Arnoldus Arlenius, who worked in Mendoza's library, and published in Basle by Hieronymus Froben in 1544.\n\nHe acted for some time as military governor of Siena, represented Spain diplomatically at the Council of Trent, and in 1547 was nominated special plenipotentiary at Rome, where he remained till 1554. He was never a favourite of Philip II, and a quarrel with a courtier resulted in his banishment from court in June 1568. The remaining years of his life, which were spent at Granada, he devoted to the study of Arabic (which he had learned at home when growing up), to poetry, and to his history of the Moorish insurrection of 1568–1570. He died in 1575, leaving his library to the king.\n\nHis \"Guerra de Granada\" (concerning the 1568 Morisco Revolt in the\nAlpujarras) was published in Madrid in 1610 and in Lisbon by Luis Tribaldos de Toledo in 1627; the delay was doubtless due to Mendoza's severe criticism of contemporaries who survived him. A complete edition was not published until 1730. In some passages the author deliberately imitates Sallust and Tacitus; his style is, on the whole, vivid and trenchant, his information is exact, and in critical insight he is not inferior to Juan de Mariana.\n\nThe attribution to Mendoza of Lazarillo de Tormes is disputed, but documents recently discovered by the Spanish paleographer Mercedes Agulló reinforce the hypothesis. That he excelled in picaresque malice is proved by his indecorous verses written in the old Castilian metres and in the more elaborate measures imported from Italy. Mendoza is believed to be the author of the letters to Feliciano de Silva and to Captain Salazar, published by Antonio Paz y Melia in Sales Espanolas (Madrid, 1900).\n\n\n"}

Her Polish-born Jewish father, Samuel Brimberg, was an office furniture manufacturer and a violent bully. Her mother was the daughter of a multimillionaire Jewish manufacturer and inventor. Dundy grew up in a Park Avenue home where she was educated by a governess, though she eventually attended high school, where her boyfriend Terry was the son of playwright Maxwell Anderson. Later, they met again and almost married. A habituée of New York nightclubs from the age of 15, she met the exiled Dutch painter Piet Mondrian, who wished to be taught how to jitterbug. An honors graduate from Sweet Briar College in Sweet Briar, Virginia, she studied acting at the Jarvis Theatre School in Washington with future star actors Rod Steiger, Tony Curtis and others, and in the Dramatic Workshop was taught by Erwin Piscator.\n\nDundy's controlling father insisted she live at home while in New York, but she calculated that her monthly allowance would allow her to live in Paris for a short time. At the end of World War II, she traveled to Europe, first to live in Paris, France, dubbing French films, before settling in London, where she performed in a BBC radio play. In 1950, she met the theater critic Kenneth Tynan, and two weeks later, they began living together. They married on January 25, 1951, had a daughter Tracy (born May 12, 1952, London), and became part of the theatrical and film elite of London and Hollywood. Dundy's sister, Shirley Clarke, was a leading independent filmmaker and a professor of film at UCLA. \n\nAmong her roles as an actress, she appeared in \"The Scream,\" a 1953 episode of the TV series \"Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Presents\", and a BBC-TV production of \"Dinner at Eight\" as a maid: \"One of those small parts an actress can do absolutely nothing with except look as pretty as possible, act as naive as possible and stay out of the way of the knives.\" Dundy was heard in different roles on Radio Luxembourg's Harry Lime dramas, directed by Orson Welles. In 1955, Dundy and Tynan appeared together on camera, hosting the \"Madrid Bullfight\" episode of \"Around the World With Orson Welles\", the documentary series Welles made for Associated-Rediffusion, a contractor for Britain's ITV commercial network.\n\nIn 1958, Dundy published her first novel, \"The Dud Avocado\", loosely based on her experiences in Paris. It reached the top of the bestseller lists. She received a letter from an admirer:Dear Mrs Tynan, I don't make the habit of writing to married women, especially if the husband is a dramatic critic, but I had to tell someone (and it might as well be you since you're the author) how much I enjoyed \"The Dud Avocado\". It made me laugh, scream and guffaw (which incidentally is a great name for a law firm). If this was actually your life, I don't know how on earth you got through it. Sincerely, Groucho Marx.\nTynan disapproved of Dundy's writing vocation, despite having forecast success, because it distracted attention from himself, though Dundy herself had seen it as a means to save their marriage. Around this time Tynan started to insist on flagellating his wife, with the threat of his own suicide if she refused. Drugs, alcohol, and extramarital affairs by both parties resulted in the marriage becoming fraught, and it was dissolved in 1964. In 1962, she was a writer for the BBC's satirical \"That Was the Week That Was\". Dundy eventually cured herself of addictions during the period 1968-76 and maintained her initial success as an author, while living mainly in New York. In addition to novels and short stories, Dundy wrote for \"The New York Times\". She wrote books on the actor Peter Finch, the city of Ferriday, Louisiana, and Elvis Presley, about whom she said, \"Prior to 1977, I didn't know that Elvis was alive until he died.\" \n\nAs part of her research for the Presley book, Dundy moved from her luxurious suites in London and New York to live for five months in Presley's birthplace of Tupelo, Mississippi. \"Elvis and Gladys\" was first published by Macmillan in 1985 (reissued in 2004 by the University Press of Mississippi). The \"Boston Globe\" hailed it as \"nothing less than the best Elvis book yet.\" \"Kirkus Reviews\" described it as \"the most fine-grained Elvis bio ever.\"\n\nDundy maintained a home in London until 1986, and then moved to Los Angeles to be near her daughter. By then, Tracy was a costume designer; she is married to film director Jim McBride. Dundy published her autobiography, \"Life Itself!\", in 2001. Her 1964 novel, \"The Old Man and Me\", was reissued in 2005 by the feminist publishing company Virago Press, and that same year, she wrote the introduction for Virago's reprint of Daphne du Maurier's 1932 novel, \"I'll Never Be Young Again\".\n\nTracy Tynan's memoir, \"Wear and Tear\", published in the United States in 2016, deals with Tynan's trying experiences of her parents.\n\nIn Dundy's final years, she was losing her eyesight owing to macular degeneration. She died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, California on May 1, 2008, aged 86. She is buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although first released for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh in 2001, it was ported to the Nintendo DS in 2005. It was followed by two expansion packs, \"Dinosaur Digs\" and \"Marine Mania\", which were released in 2002, as well as a sequel, \"Zoo Tycoon 2\", released in 2004.\n\nThe goal of \"Zoo Tycoon\" is to create a thriving zoo by building exhibits to accommodate animals and keeping the guests and animals happy. Exhibit-building is one of the primary goals of \"Zoo Tycoon\". To keep the guests and animals happy, exhibits should be suitable to the animal; for example, a lion is best suited to a savannah environment. Choices in terrain, foliage, rocks, shelters, fences, toys and the presence of zookeepers all contribute to the suitability of an exhibit and the happiness of the animal. Guest happiness is dependent on animal choice, animal happiness, buildings, and scenery. Buildings include bathrooms, restaurants and food stands, shops, reptile houses, aviaries, and entertainment buildings such as movie theaters. Scenery involves aesthetics that raise guest happiness slightly, such as topiary art, light posts, and benches. Keeping both animal and guest happiness high allows the player to gain monetary awards and maintain a steady income. To help manage the expanding zoo, players can employ maintenance workers, zookeepers and tour guides. If the animals are released and escape from their enclosures, they can kill the guests. Sometimes, when animals are unhappy in their exhibits, they can attack the zookeepers.\n\nThere are three modes in \"Zoo Tycoon\": Tutorial, Scenario, and Freeform. Tutorial teaches the player how to build exhibits and keep guests happy. Scenario mode has the player complete a series of objectives under restrictions. These objectives may include achieving a certain guest and animal happiness, achieving a certain exhibit suitability, displaying a certain number of animals, or breeding a certain animal. Freeform allows the player to choose the amount of money and the map with which they start. They are presented with an open lot and a limited selection of animals, buildings, and scenery available for purchase. As the game progresses, more animals and items become playable. Additional animals and items may be researched, where money is invested to make them playable.\n\n\"Zoo Tycoon\" was created in the wake of the success of the 1999 Hasbro Interactive game \"RollerCoaster Tycoon\", which sold well for many years. \"Zoo Tycoon\" did well enough for Microsoft and Blue Fang Games to release two expansion packs: \"Dinosaur Digs\", which added prehistoric-themed items and animals including mythical creatures, and \"Marine Mania\", which added aquatic-themed items and animals. \n\nEventually, Microsoft bundled the expansion packs with \"Zoo Tycoon\" to create Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection as Hasbro had done for \"RollerCoaster Tycoon\". This had the functionality of both expansion packs and bonus content.\n\nReleased on May 19, 2002, \"Dinosaur Digs\" includes 20 new prehistoric animals to choose from including mammoths, saber-toothed cats, and varied dinosaurs as well as prehistoric-themed items and buildings. In addition, new types of electrical fences to accommodate the animals and prehistoric foliage have been introduced. As in the previous game, more extinct animals, foliage and better care for dinosaurs can be researched. Each dinosaur is adopted as an egg. The game introduces a new staff member, the scientist, to care for the egg and, once it hatches, the dinosaur itself.\n\nDespite the fact that the player can purchase electrified fences to keep dinosaurs contained in exhibits, it is still possible for them to escape. If one does escape, the player will have to hire a dinosaur recovery team to find and tranquilize it so that it can be returned to its exhibit.\n\nThe second expansion pack to the game wherein players can create and manage underwater exhibits or merge aquatic tanks with traditional land habitats was released on October 17, 2002. Interactive tutorials and virtual marine specialists are available to help players maintain animal happiness. In addition, 10 new scenarios were added. The expansion pack provides the ability to create aquatic shows.\n\nEric Bratcher reviewed the PC version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"A pleasant diversion, but it's about as deep as a puddle, and frustratingly finicky.\"\n\n\"Zoo Tycoon\" was received with mixed to positive reviews, gaining an average 68 out of 100 at Metacritic. GameZone gave the game a score of 8 out of 10.\n\n\"Zoo Tycoon\" and its compiled \"Complete Collection\" garnered several awards and accolades, gaining the Bologna New Media Prize in 2002. \"Zoo Tycoon: Complete Collection\" received the Parents' Choice Foundation Gold Award - 2003, the AIAS Computer Family Title of the Year Interactive Achievement Award - 2004, the Scholastic Parent & Child Teacher's Pick – 2004, and the Children's Software Revue All Star Award – 2004.\n\n\"Zoo Tycoon\" was a commercial success. Within a year of release, the game rose above 1 million copies in sales. By October 2003, its global sales had surpassed 2.5 million copies, or 3 million when grouped with its expansion packs. The NPD Group declared it the eighth-best-selling computer game of 2002, and the 11th-best-selling of 2003. NPD proceeded to rank the game's \"Zoo Tycoon: Complete Collection\" bundle 10th for 2004, 16th for 2005 and 12th for 2006.\n\nIn the United States alone, \"Zoo Tycoon\" sold 1.1 million units and earned $28.2 million by August 2006. It was among the country's 15 highest-selling computer games ever by July 2004, and \"Edge\" ranked it as the country's fifth-best-selling computer game released between January 2000 and August 2006. \"Zoo Tycoon\" also received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom; and a \"Gold\" certification from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Switzerland and Austria.\n\nThe \"Zoo Tycoon\" series, including the original \"Zoo Tycoon\", surpassed 4 million copies in global sales by July 2004. Over 2 million copies of the series were sold in the United States alone by that date. Series sales in the country rose to 2.9 million units by August 2006.\n\n\"Zoo Tycoon 2\" was released in November 2004. Although initially containing fewer animals than the original \"Zoo Tycoon\", more animals were introduced in its expansion packs: \"\", \"\", \"\", and \"\". The first two were bundled in the \"Zoo Tycoon 2: Zookeeper Collection; a\"ll of them were bundled in \"Zoo Tycoon 2 Ultimate Collection\".\n"}

He was imperial secretary (Greek \"grammatikos\", most likely a post connected with the military administration) to Emperor Manuel I (1143–1180), whom he accompanied on his campaigns in Europe and Asia Minor. It appears that Kinnamos outlived Andronikos I, who died in 1185.\n\nKinnamos was the author of a history that covered the years 1118-1176, thereby continuing the \"Alexiad\" of Anna Komnene, and covering the reigns of John II and Manuel I, until Manuel's unsuccessful campaign against the Turks, which ended with the disastrous Battle of Myriokephalon.\n\nKinnamos's work breaks off abruptly, though it is highly likely that the original continued to the death of Manuel. There are also indications that the present work is an abridgment of a significantly larger work. The hero of the history is Manuel, and throughout the history Kinnamos attempts to highlight what he sees as the superiority of the Byzantine Empire to the Western and other powers. Similarly, he is a determined opponent of what he perceives as the pretensions of the papacy. Nevertheless, he writes with the straightforwardness of a soldier, and occasionally admits his ignorance of certain events. The work is well organized, and its style, modeled on Xenophon, is simple, especially when compared with the florid writing of other Greek authors of the period. William Plate considers him the best of the European historians of this period.\n\nJohn Kinnamos is also credited for writing a book on one of the Angeli emperors, however this book is believed to be lost (perhaps together with the rest of his much larger work).\n\n"}
{"id": "2309942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309942", "title": "I Made Bandem", "text": "I Made Bandem\n\nProf. Dr. I Made Bandem (also known as \"the Joe Papp of Bali\") is a Balinese dancer, artist, author, and educator.\n\nBandem studied Balinese dance from a very early age, and was performing Baris and other dances by the age of ten. One of the first Balinese dancers to study in the United States, Bandem earned his master's degree in dance from UCLA, and his PhD in ethnomusicology from Wesleyan University. Bandem's academic career includes sixteen years as the director of the Indonesian College of the Arts in Denpasar, and was also the Rector(President) of Indonesia's oldest cultural institution, the Institut Seni Indonesia - Jogjakarta (Indonesian Institute of The Arts - Jogjakarta). Dr. Bandem is succeeded by Prof. Soeprapto Soedjono, B.A., M.F.A., Ph.D as the current Rector(President) of The Indonesian Institute of the Art - Jogjakarta. Dr. Bandem is currently a professor of Balinese dance and music at The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nAt Holy Cross, Bandem currently teaches both music and dance dealing with the Bali-Gamelan. He is well respected throughout Bali and many other countries as an integral component to the recognition, respect, and continuation of the Balinese culture.\n\nAs an artist and as a visiting scholar, Bandem has taught and performed Balinese dance throughout the world.\n\nBandem's accomplishment and contribution to arts and culture can be grouped into four major domains including achievements in ethnomusicology, , arts and culture management, and political career.\n\nBandem is the first Indonesian to accomplish the Ph.D title in ethnomusicology from Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut (1980). As a scholar in the field of world music, Bandem fathoms and advances a school of thought popularly termed as the “bi-musicality” that was initially promoted by Prof. Dr. Mantle Hood. Bandem refers bi-musicality as a conception that music is a universal language and every ethnomusicologist must comprehend more than one genre of world music.\n\nDuring his studies in the US, Bandem learnt and came to terms with sounds and rhythms from around the world including music genre of Japan, Thailand, Korea, as well as China. In return, such experience gave Bandem the capabilities and firmness to conduct in-depth research of various Nusantara (Indonesian) music including Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Java, and Bali. Aside from immersing himself in the studies of world music, Bandem also mastered the integral aspects of dance and theatre – all influencing his scientific approaches.\n\nAs an ethnomusicologist, Bandem has published plenty of books and scientific articles pertaining arts and culture, both nationally and internationally. One of his writing that is highly regarded as a classic by artists of music, dance, and theatre is the book \"\" (1981; reprinted 1995) and distributed by Oxford University Press, Kuala Lumpur. This book has induced worldwide appreciation upon the arts and culture of Bali. Other theoretical publications about music, dance, and theatre of Indonesia include \"\", \"Wayang Wong in Contemporary Bali\", \"Traditional Theatre of Indonesia\", and \"Encyclopedia of Balinese Dance\" – all these books are text books and reference for those studying Indonesian arts. Aside from writings concerning performing arts, Bandem also possess great interest in fine arts, and many of his articles are closely related to historical and aesthetic studies of Indonesian fine arts.\nBandem's commitment in ethnomusicology augmented with the establishment of an Indonesian music association namely Masyarakat Musicology Indonesia (MMI) by him and a group of friends in 1985. MMI hails from Surakarta, Central Java, and Bandem was the first chairman of the non-profit association. Today, MMI has advanced as Masyarakat Seni Pertunjukan Indonesia (MSPI), as a center for research, creation, and development of Indonesian arts, both classic and contemporary. With this organization, Bandem has managed to raise and popularize ethnomusicology as a major discipline in art universities in Indonesia.\n\nIn 1986, Bandem initiated The First International Gamelan Festival; an evaluation on the advancement of gamelan in the global milieu that was conducted in conjunction with the 1986 Vancouver Expo in Canada. During the festival, more than 250 delegates participated and represented gamelan (traditional Indonesian music orchestra) and ethnic music groups from all over the world. The festival is evidence that Indonesian music especially its various sorts of gamelan are integral part of the world music setting.\n\nBandem played an important role in the progression of Indonesian arts and culture through teachings in many universities including the University of Hawaii, University of California, Los Angeles, Wesleyan University, University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Brown University.\n\nThe outstanding response led to the amplification of studies upon the Indonesian arts and culture particularly in the learning of the music and dance.\n\nConsequently, many leading universities in the United States of America, Canada, Japan and Europe sought the inclusion of Indonesian art and culture studies into their curriculum. According to Balungan and Ear Magazine, there are more than 300 active gamelan groups around North America, Europe, Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 2006, Bandem was awarded the Fumio Koizumi Prize for his dedication and long life achievement in the field of ethnomusicology.\n\nAfter attaining his Ph.D, Bandem returned to Indonesia from the US and was appointed as the Chancellor of the Indonesia Dance Academy (ASTI) Denpasar by the Ministry of Education and Culture (1982). Since then, Bandem exerted great effort to amplify the institution's status to become Indonesian Arts College (STSI) Denpasar and now Indonesia Institute of Arts. The efforts to increase the status of the institution to a higher level is not only a matter of political administration, but more a struggle to advocate arts as science, to equally position art in contrast to other field of studies. This struggle becomes imperative as the majority of Indonesia still view art as a profession (vocation), not a substantial field of study.\n\nBandem's formulation of art from the perspective of ontology, epistemology, and axiology became the groundwork for the Ministry Department of National Education Indonesia to permit Indonesian art universities to conduct S-1, S-2 (Master of Art), and S-3 (Ph.D.) programs. Bandem's effort with the collective support from other art scientists in Indonesia entitled Indonesia Institute of Arts (ISI) Jogjakarta to conduct and award Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and Doctor of Creative Art (DCA) in the field of art.\n\nAs an educational administrator, Bandem was trusted by the Ministry Department of National Education Indonesia to lead ASTI Denpasar (1981-1989), STSI Denpasar (1989-1997) and ISI Jogjakarta (1997-2006). In his 25 years in office, many of his conceptions became the model for the development of art universities in Indonesia.\n\nIn 1998, Bandem successfully established Badan Kerjasama Perguruan Tinggi Seni Indonesia (Indonesia Art University Cooperative Board). This association has initiated and produced the “New Paradigm of Art Universities”, a manual being used as the foundation to conduct higher learning of arts in Indonesia. Bandem truly plays a central role in increasing the quality of art education in Indonesia.\n\nIn conjunction to his duties as Rector of art universities over the past 25 years, Bandem was also given responsibility by the National Government as Secretary and Consortium Member of Komisi Disiplin Ilmu Seni (Commission for Art Discipline) that is an integral aspect of Indonesian Academy of Sciences. Bandem was also member of Badan Pertimbangan Pendidikan Nasional (Advisory Board of National Education), an organization pertaining national education under the direct supervision of the President of Republic Indonesia. Bandem dedicated his ideas through this governing body to make education in Indonesia as education for unity in diversity and to influence the government to implement multimedia based education. In response to such policy, currently Bandem is the chancellor of a leading information and computer technology university in Bali.\n\nAs an artist, Bandem also learns and performs the dances and music of other cultures. While Bandem is well known for his creative directing in monumental works in Balinese performing arts, he also masters the Gagaku and Bugaku, the classical Japanese music and dance that he learned from his teacher Matsaro Togi, a national treasure of classical Japanese dance.\n\nFurthermore, Bandem is also a culture engineer. His policy on preservation and development of the traditional Balinese arts and culture is formulated into a strategic development plan termed Sustainable Development with Cultural Orientation. One interesting interpretation of this policy is Continuity in Change, an aspect elaborated and practiced in many occasions including the Bali Arts Festival.\n\nTogether with Prof. Dr. Ida Bagus Mantra, the Governor of Bali (1978-1988), Bandem is among the founding fathers and driving force behind the Bali Arts Festival. This annual event has become a mental model for the preservation and development of the Balinese arts and culture as a whole. Currently, The Bali Arts Festival has entered its 27th year\n\nBandem has been actively involved in outlining the annual theme of the Bali Arts Festival from 1980 to 1997, as well as being executive producer and creative directors of numerous performances for the festival.\n\nThe successful impact of the Bali Arts Festival as means for arts and culture development has influenced the province of Yunnan in China to implement such festival. Bandem became the consultant for the festival particularly outlining preservation and development strategies for the arts and culture of minority groups within.\n\nBandem was also the Artistic Director for many Indonesian performances in numerous World Expos and other International Arts Festival. These include Expo Vancouver (1986), Expo Brisbane (1988), Indonesian Festival in USA (1990, 1991), Expo Sevilla (1992), Hanover Fair (1995) and Indonesia Japan Friendship Festival (1997).\n\nFor his role and influence in increasing quality of output and abundance of art masterpieces receiving great reviews in and abroad, Collin's Guide to Bali refers Bandem as the \"Bali Art Czar\".\n\nIn 1997, Bandem also accomplished the establishment of the Museum Gamelan (The Museum for Musical Instruments of Indonesia) within the dynamic compounds of the Indonesian Arts College (STSI, now ISI) Denpasar. The museum itself holds the largest collection of musical ensembles native to Indonesia, where all musical ensembles as well as the hundreds of various musical instruments being displayed are intended to become a medium for arts education. The museum is equipped with an archive centre that holds various forms of recordings, all representing documentation of the arts and culture. Other collections on exhibit include dance costumes, masks, shadow puppets, sculpture and paintings.\n\nHis devotion to fine arts is profuse and is advanced through active participation within the fine art scene. Together with his diverse network of arts and culture enthusiasts, Bandem established the first ever Bali Biennale; the biannual visual arts exhibition in 2005.\n\nThe holding of both the Pre-Bali Biennale in 5 cities in Java and 9 venues in Bali, as well as the Summit Event Bali Biennale in 9 venues in Bali as well as the Cartoon Pavilion is a reconstruction upon the traditional creative propensities of Balinese visual arts, as creativity is not grouped on the base of its customary aesthetic style, school and movement but is viewed from the perspective of Bali as a geo-culture unity that corresponds to the greater multiculturalism in today's global society.\n\nBandem is the current chairman of the Bali Biennale Organizing Committee.\n\nIn 1994, UNESCO awarded the International UNESCO Music Council Award to Bandem as recognition upon his wholehearted attention and dedication upon the world of arts and culture as well as the implementation of his concepts.\n\nBandem grew interest in the field of practical politics since senior high school and he has been trusted by his colleagues to lead a political organization called GSNI. Bandem not only took charge of the senior high school level organization, but also became the Vice Chairmen of GSNI for Bali.\n\nDuring his time in the USA particularly in Hawaii and California, Bandem actively lead PERMIAS (Indonesian Student Association in United States of America). Bandem's extensive network abroad has been constructed since these times.\n\nAfter completing his doctoral studies in USA, Bandem returned to Bali and continued his enthusiasm in Indonesian politics. Soon after his return, Bandem was appointed as the Vice Chairmen of the major political party Golongan Karya in Bali from 1982-1998. This position permitted Bandem to become a member of the Indonesian House Assembly (MPR-RI) as state representative for the Province of Bali (1988-1998).\n\nDuring his time as member of the Indonesian House Assembly (MPR-RI), Bandem was elected as the Secretary and Speaker for the Ad Hoc II Committee that is responsible for strategies and decisions of the national politics. Through this committee, Bandem demonstrated his keenness for Indonesian character building from the viewpoint of arts and culture.\n\nFurthermore, although unsuccessful, Bandem was supported by the Balinese public as candidate for the 1998-2003 Governor of Bali during the 1998 election.\n\nTaken as a whole, Bandem's stance towards the significance of arts and culture as a vibrant counterpart to the pulsating dynamics of socio-culture, political, and technology represents a notion that arts and culture are imperative elements for peace, concord, and the betterment of the world.\n\nHis belief for cordial cross-border interconnectedness by the means of arts and culture has bestowed him the Habibie Award in 2003 from the Habibie Center. \nHis pro-active approach has emphasized the importance of arts and culture as a reflective conscious to attain harmony among nations especially between respective cultures and the global forces.\n"}

The service runs from , and runs the entire length of the eponymous South Coast railway line to . The service also runs along the Eastern Suburbs railway line at peak hours and the Port Kembla railway line to . It is operated with NSW TrainLink H sets and Sydney Trains T sets, with Endeavour railcars operating the service on the non-electrified line between and Bomaderry.\n\nPassenger trains first operated on the South Coast railway line in 1887, and is one of five routes on the NSW TrainLink Intercity network. The South Coast Line routes span 40 stations, across 159 km of railway. An additional 5 stations and 7 km of railway are travelled by South Coast Line trains at peak hour on the Eastern Suburbs railway line.\n\nThe first passenger train services on the Illawarra commenced on 21 June 1887, after the line was completed from Clifton to , and later, North Kiama on 9 November 1887. The line was later connected to via , , and the following year between July and October 1888, after delays on construction between Waterfall and Clifton. The line was further extended to through , opening on 2 June 1893.\n\nThroughout its long history, the South Coast Line's roster of stations have changed significantly. Many stations in the Upper Illawarra had closed and new ones opened towards the first half of the 20th century. Stations such as the ones serving Clifton were closed, along with a majority of the original railway between Waterfall and Coalcliff between 1915 and 1920, replaced with a new alignment that made use of a flatter gradient and made the infamous Otford Tunnel defunct. New stations along the line that opened throughout this period included in 1902, in 1915, in 1916, in 1917, and in 1948. Further removals of stations from the line in the latter half of the 20th century included the station serving Yallah in 1974, the majority of the stations on the line between Kiama and Bomaderry, and in 1983. was also closed in November 2014, replaced by , after rising commercial and residential development in Flinders and Shell Cove and their distance from Dunmore station, prompted the Government of New South Wales to build a replacement station closer to the area of urban growth.\n\nWhile the railway network at Port Kembla was built in 1916, stations and passenger trains servicing the surrounding suburbs did not operate until 5 January 1920, when the Port Kembla railway station was opened. A station at was added to the Port Kembla commuter branch in 1926, along with one at , a decade later, in 1936. A railway station for workers at Port Kembla, named , after the nearby Lysaght steel plant, was also opened in 1938.\n\nSome platforms on the line (e.g. Scarborough) are only 4 or 6 cars long, so not all doors may open on 8-car trains.\n\nServices were originally operated with locomotive-hauled trains and, later, Diesel railcars, prior to the electrification of the South Coast railway line. The line was electrified to in 1984, with the suburban Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line service occasionally extending its service past the terminus at to Helensburgh during peak hours, a practice that the current Sydney Trains Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line service still follows today. Electrification extended to the following year. Despite the newly installed electrification, diesel sets and locomotive-hauled trains still operated along the line from all the way past Wollongong to Sydney, including the \"South Coast Daylight Express\", until 1991. Electrification of the South Coast railway line was further extended to in 1993 and, finally, to Kiama in 2001. The railway between Kiama and is the only part of the line that remains non-electrified, operated by New South Wales Endeavour railcars since their introduction in 1994.\n\nThe electrified rolling stock of the South Coast Line began with V set intercity trains. There were later accompanied by Tangaras when they were introduced into the CityRail network in 1988. Originally, the Tangaras that ran on the South Coast Line were different variations of T sets known as G sets. G sets differed from T sets in that they had reversible seats, toilets, fresh water dispensers and luggage racks. In late 2005, it was discovered that a majority of the V set rolling stock operating on the South Coast Line were suffering from corrosion in their underframes. More G sets were introduced onto the South Coast Line to compensate, and eventually became the standard rolling stock on the South Coast Line after V sets ceased operating on the service. From January 2012, V sets ceased operating South Coast services. In 2009, however, after the introduction of OSCARs onto the intercity CityRail network, All G sets were recalled for conversion into T sets. The OSCAR fleet effectively replaced the G set rolling stock and, since 2010, standard Sydney Trains T sets, owned by NSW TrainLink, have been operating services to Port Kembla.\n\nIn 2017, it was revealed that the Liberal state government had reviewed a 3.6 billion dollar tunnel between Thirroul and Waterfall that could reduce travel time between Sydney and Wollongong by 22 minutes, but that rail improvements were being sidetracked in favour of improving and extending the nearby Princes Motorway.\n\nOn 20 December 1994, an accident involving two empty S sets occurred during a shunting procedure at . One of the trains jack-knifed onto the platform, demolishing the concrete pedestrian bridge. No injuries or casualties, however, were reported. On the morning of 31 January 2003, an intercity Tangara en route to derailed at high speed between Waterfall and , resulting in the deaths of seven people and injury of forty. The accident was the third major accident resulting in fatalities on the CityRail network in 13 years, after the Cowan rail accident in 1990 and Glenbrook rail accident in 1999.\n\nOn 24 November 2011, a Pacific National coal train derailed near Clifton, causing the suspension of South Coast Line services between Waterfall and . Services were resumed four days later, after the derailed train was removed from the tracks. The train had derailed immediately after coming out of the Clifton tunnel, with the front eight clearing the tunnel and derailing, and the rear twelve carriages remaining inside the tunnel. The Office of Transport Safety Investigations found that the cause of the derailment was a broken axle.\n\nPeak hour and weekend services commence from or on the Eastern Suburbs railway line, and stop at Central at Platform 25. At other times, services depart from Central (Sydney Terminal). They generally use platform 11, but this can change at short notice, as with all services from Sydney Terminal.\n\nSome peak hour and weekend services are listed as pickup only at intermediate suburban stations (eg. Redfern Hurstville, Sutherland). This restriction is to ensure the train does not fill up with suburban passengers, who have plenty of other suburban services to take. Pickup only stations are not displayed on platform screens, but will be displayed on in-train screens.\n\nThe most common Central to services are operated by 4/8 car NSW TrainLink H sets (OSCARs). All-stations services operate between Waterfall, Thirroul and Port Kembla with 4-car Sydney Trains T sets (Tangaras). Shuttle train services between Kiama and are operated by 2-car diesel New South Wales Endeavour railcars, due to the line not being electrified past Kiama.\n\nFrom 2020, all services are to be taken over by 4 and 6 car D Sets. This will free up OSCars for transferral to suburban railway work. Two-car Endeavour sets will continue to operate the Kiama to Bomaderry section. These are set to be replaced by the new bi-modal regional fleet in 2023. \nWeekday Peak Hours\n\nThere are no set stopping patterns for peak hours, however every 20 minutes a service operates between Bondi Junction all stations to Central (Platforms 24/25), Redfern (Platform 11/12), Wolli Creek, Hurstville and the South Coast. Some trains start/end at Wollongong and Thirroul. There are also some local services starting at Waterfall or Thirroul.\n\nWeekday Off-Peak\n\nWeekends\n\nRarer patterns\n\nSome late night or early morning services:\n\n\nSome afternoon services:\n\n\n"}

It was designed and built by General Electric. Also known as Microgun, the XM214 was a scaled-down smaller and lighter version of the M134 minigun, firing M193 5.56×45mm ammunition.\n\nThe XM214 was first developed for aircraft applications. Later General Electric developed it into a man-portable weapon system, known as the GE Six-Pak. The complete Six-Pak system weighed 85 pounds (38.5 kg) with 1,000 rounds of ammunition, comparable in weight to some heavy machine guns. The basic gun in the Six-Pak weighed 27 pounds, or 12.2 kg. The system could be carried by a team of two soldiers and mounted either to an M122 tripod or a vehicle's pintle mount. Length overall is 104.1 cm, gun only is 68.6 cm long. Width (including ammunition case) is 44.4 cm. Sighting was usually by optical telescope.\n\nThe Six-Pak consisted of the XM214, the power module, and the ammunition module consisted of two 500-round, factory packed, and disposable cassettes mounted to a holding rack. Linked ammunition was fed through a flexible chute to the gun; when the first cassette was empty, ammunition would then feed from the second cassette, tripping a visible signal that a new cassette needed to be added to the rack.\n\nThe power module contained a 24-volt nickel-cadmium battery, a motor, and solid-state electronic controls. Unless the battery was plugged into a vehicle's power supply, the battery's charge would be depleted after 3,000 rounds. The system could be broken down quickly into two portable loads of roughly 42 pounds apiece. This was accomplished by means of a quick-release fitting at that end of the belt chute fastened to the gun.\n\nElectronic controls contained a burst limiter and handled the automatic clearing of the gun after bursts. Using the electronic controls, the weapon's rate of fire could be adjusted from 400 rpm all the way up to 4,000 rpm. Later editions of \"Jane's Infantry Weapons\" claimed a theoretical cyclic rate of up to 6,000 rpm. George Chinn, author of \"The Machine Gun Volume V\", contended that the XM214 prototype had a rate of fire of up to 10,000 rpm, but the man-portable Six-Pak was limited to 4,000 rpm.\n\nAn 88 by 10 inch (224 x 25 cm) 5.56mm Microgun Pod was also developed for external use on light aircraft and helicopters. The unit had an ammunition capacity of 1,500 to 3,500 rounds and a loaded weight of 186 to 300 pounds. The feeding system was linkless via a helical drum and had a nominal rate of fire of 6,000 rpm. Adjustments to 1,000 or 10,000 rpm were possible if desired. Power could be provided by a built-in battery pack or from the aircraft itself.\n\nThe ability to fire the 5.56 mm round used by the M16 rifle was the major selling point for the Microgun. With a fast-firing gun using standard assault rifle ammunition, the US Army and US Air Force showed interest for use of the XM214 on aircraft, helicopters, and armored vehicles. The smaller and lighter Microgun could replace the Minigun on heavily armed gunship aircraft and attack helicopters, freeing up space for ammo, equipment, and even more guns. Certain small aircraft that could not handle the larger Miniguns could be given the XM214 in a 300-pound pod. General Electric pitched the weapon to the US Navy for use on riverine craft. Company engineers proposed many mounting arrangements including open doors, in an aircraft's wings or nose, putting half a dozen guns in a modified bomb bay, and even in turrets of an automated defense network. However, the Microgun's prominent feature of using 5.56 mm ammunition was also its downfall. For aircraft gunners, accuracy suffered at high speeds, and range, compared to the 7.62 mm Minigun, was limited. General Electric tried to refocus its efforts by making the Microgun an infantry weapon, but the Army showed no interest.\n\n\nNon-NATO:\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}

All his descendants are members of the Yi clan of Jeonju, including the imperial family of the Korean Empire (1897–1910).\n\nAfter the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, in which the Empire of Japan annexed the Korean Peninsula, some members of the Yi clan of Jeonju were mediatised into the Imperial House of Japan and the Japanese peerage by the Japanese government until 1947, just before the Constitution of Japan was promulgated. Under the 11th Article of the Constitution of South Korea, the Korean government does not acknowledge any form of privileged caste since its promulgation in 1948. However, with the Constitution succeeding to the Provisional Government, the Imperial Family continues to exist as a favored symbol and attracts media attention in South Korea. This happened most recently with the July 2005 funeral of Yi Gu, former head of the royal household, in addition to Prince Yi Seok in the 100th anniversary of Korean independence on March 1, 2019.\n\nIn the 19th century tensions mounted between China and Japan, culminating in the First Sino-Japanese War. Much of this war was fought on the Korean Peninsula. Japan, after the Meiji Restoration, acquired Western military technology, and forced Joseon to sign the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876 after the Ganghwa Island incident. It established a strong economic presence on the peninsula, heralding the beginning of Japanese imperial expansion in East Asia.\n\nThe Chinese defeat in the 1894 war led to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which officially guaranteed Korea's independence from China. The treaty effectively granted Japan direct control over Korean politics. The Joseon court in 1894, pressured by encroachment from larger powers, felt the need to reinforce national integrity and declared the Korean Empire. King Gojong assumed the title of Emperor in order to assert Korea's independence by putting himself on the same level as the Chinese Emperors. In addition, other foreign powers were approached for military technology, especially Russia, in order to fend off the Japanese. Technically, 1894 marks the end of the Joseon period, as the official name of the state was changed; however, the dynasty continued, albeit perturbed by Japanese interventions. For example, the 1895 assassination of the emperor's consort, Queen Min, apparently orchestrated by Japanese general Miura Gorō because the Korean empress was effective in keeping Japan at bay.\n\nIn 1910, the Japanese annexation of the Korean peninsula effectively ended rule by the House of Yi. The collapse of the Russian navy in the historic battle of Port Arthur (in which the Russian Imperial Navy was destroyed in a decisive surprise attack), led to a great weakening of Korea's umbrella of protection. The combined effect on China of the opium wars in the south and Japanese naval strikes in the north increasingly led the Japanese to see Korea as a strategic foothold leading into northern China, just as Macau and Hong Kong had been Portuguese and English trade enclaves, respectively, in southern China.\n\nIn a complicated series of manoeuvres and counter-manoeuvres, Japan pushed back the Russian fleet in 1905 (see Russo-Japanese War). Both the fleets of China and Russia had given Korea sufficient protection to prevent a direct invasion, but this ambuscade of the Russian fleet gave Japan free rein over north China, and Korea was left at the mercy of the new regional naval power Japan.\n\nKorea became a protectorate of Japan in 1895 when Japan forced Emperor Gojong to abdicate and Japanese assassinated his consort. Japan annexed the country in 1910, and Korea became a colony of Imperial Japan.\n\nDuring the colonial rule, the members of Yi family were mediatised into the or made .\n\nEmperor Gojong had nine sons and four daughters, but only three princes, as well as one princess: the second son, Crown Prince Cheok; the sixth son, Yi Kang, and the seventh son, Yi Un. The second son, Cheok, became Emperor Sunjong, the last monarch of the Korean Empire. Since Emperor Sunjong died without issue, his younger brother, Prince Eun became the crown prince. His elder brother, Prince Kang, should have taken the position, but was passed over because Eun's mother, Princess Sunheon, had a higher status in the court than Kang's mother, Lady Chang.\n\nAfter Emperor Sunjong died in 1926, Crown Prince Eun was called \"King Yi of Korea\", a nominal title because the country had already lost its sovereignty to Japan. Crown Prince Eun married Japanese noblewoman Princess Masako Nashimoto, who is known as Yi Bangja, a member of the Miyake cadet family. Some Koreans accused Japan that Princess Bangja, once one of three candidates considered to for the bride of the Japanese emperor, was instead designated as Eun's wife because a medical test indicated she could be barren. As a result, some media claimed the arranged marriage was Japan's imperialist conspiracy to terminate the Korean imperial lineage. However, Princess Bangja gave birth to Yi Jin in 1921 and Yi Gu in 1931.\n\nAfter Korea's liberation in 1945, President Syngman Rhee suppressed the imperial family in order to prevent the restoration of the monarchy as he feared that its return would challenge his emerging authority as the new republic's founding father. Rhee seized and nationalized most of the family's properties. The imperial family also had to shoulder the psychological and historical burden of their ancestors' responsibility for the \"collapse of the nation\". Stripped of most of their wealth and authority, some fled to the United States and Latin America. In addition, many of the former members of the Gaeseong branch of the family had their lands repossessed and were forced to leave Korea after the military/republican government took hold in the South. Known descendants currently reside in New Jersey and New York, one of which married the daughter of a former Italian Duchess. Another of these descendants, American internet entrepreneur Andrew Lee, accepted a nomination by Yi Seok in 2018 to become a Crown Prince. Syngman Rhee himself was a 16th-generation descendant of Taejong of Joseon.\n\nIt was only in 1963 that a new president, Park Chung-hee, allowed the imperial family, including Princess Deokhye, to return to Korea. However, they could only stay at Nakseon Hall, a small residence in a corner of Changdeokgung in Seoul. Crown Prince Eun died seven years later after a long illness resulting from strokes. Yi Gu was forced by other family members to divorce his American wife, the former Julia Mullock, in 1982 due to her sterility (the couple, however, had an adopted daughter). A series of business failures left Prince Gu without support, and he died alone at the Grand Prince Hotel Akasaka in Tokyo on July 16, 2005. The site of the hotel had been his birthplace 74 years prior.\n\nEmperor Gojong's sixth son, Prince Kang, fathered 13 sons and 9 daughters by 14 women. With an extremely wide range of historical evaluations over him—womanizer and behind the scenes leader of the independence movement—the Japanese authorities limited the activities of the prince throughout the occupation. President Syngman Rhee's seizure of the imperial properties deprived Prince Kang of most of his wealth. According to the prince's 11th son, Yi Seok, his mother, Hong Chongsun, was forced to sell noodles as a street vendor to make a living.\n\nIn 1998, it was reported that Prince Kang's eighth son died alone in a social center in eastern Seoul. The eleventh son, Prince Seok, is a lecturer at the Jeonju University as of 2005. Among Prince Kang's surviving four sons and seven daughters, four lost touch with the family after they left for the United States. The other family members hold an ancestral ritual two times a year for Prince Kang, but usually only two or three of the 11 surviving siblings attend the ceremonies. Amy Yi, a granddaughter of Gojong, migrated to the United States in 1956 and worked for 27 years as a librarian at Columbia University in New York City. In September, 2012, she was 82 years old and described as \"one of the last survivors of the Korean royal court\".\n\nAfter the death of Yi Ku on 16 July 2005, the head of the royal family has become a dispute. For instance, an organization formed by Yi Won in 2012, put forth Yi Won as the head of the house and an identity of Yi Ku's adopted heir according to the tradition. However, Yi Hae-won, second daughter of Yi Kang, made a counter-claim as the \"Empress of Korea\" in a private ceremony organized by her followers in a hotel room.\n\nThe following is the relationship of Yi Won and some of his notable relatives:\n\n– – – – – – - The dashed lines denote the adoptions\n"}

He was one of the first British artists to come to work in the American comics industry, a phenomenon which took root in the late 1980s and has since become standard practice.\n\nBolton's introduction to comics came about quite casually after he graduated from East Ham Technical College (whose former alumni include Gerald Scarfe, Barry Windsor-Smith and Ralph Steadman) with a degree in graphics and design.\n\nHis first works in Great Britain were for magazines like \"Look In\" (alongside other British talents such as Arthur Ranson, Angus P. Allan and Jim Baikie), \"The House of Hammer\" and \"Warrior\" (edited by Dez Skinn).\n\nIn 1981 Marvel Comics' editor Ralph Macchio noticed his work and called him to work for an adaptation of Kull of Valusia for Epic Comics. After illustrating two Kull stories, Bolton began working on the historical-fantasy character Marada, written by Chris Claremont (author of X-Men). This was published by \"Epic Illustrated\" one year later.\n\nAfter another fantasy series, \"Black Dragon\" (1985), the duo Claremont & Bolton produced some short stories about X-Men's lives for \"X-Men Classic\". This represented the first introduction of Bolton to the world of superheroes. In this period Bolton worked on covers for Eclipse and Pacific publishers, and on the graphic novel \"Someplace Strange\", written by Ann Nocenti (1988).\n\nFrom 1989 Bolton devoted himself to horror, his favourite genre. Apart from a great number of covers for Dark Horse Comics and adaptations of horror movies, the main work of this period is his collaboration with writer Clive Barker (including the \"Hellraiser\" comic book version).\n\nIn 1990 Bolton worked on the first episode of \"The Books of Magic\" for DC Comics, written by Neil Gaiman. The physical appearance of the protagonist, Timothy Hunter, is that of Bolton's eldest son. In other comic books he has also portrayed his wife and sons.\n\nIn 1995 Bolton produced art for the \"Man-Bat\" mini-series, written by Jamie Delano for DC Comics. Bolton said he accepted only because the story pivoted on a villain, instead of Batman, who he considered \"too winning\" a character.\n\nLater Bolton worked on another Batman book, \"\". His latest works include \"User\", written by Devin Grayson, \"Menz Insana\", a mad trip by Christopher Fowler, and \"Gifts of the Night\" by Paul Chadwick.\n\nIn 2003, author Neil Gaiman directed \"A Short Film About John Bolton\" where the painter (played by John O'Mahony) is interviewed by a reporter seeking to answer \"Where do your ideas come from?\" The artist is portrayed as very soft-spoken and reclusive, somewhat of a reluctant local celebrity in Crouch End, London.

The rest of the planet is divided into sparsely or entirely uninhabited zones. The largest of these making up the majority of the visible surface outside of Shuggazoom city is \"The Zone of Wasted Years\" which is a barren wasteland.\n\nThe main character is a boy named Chiro. When he was exploring the outskirts of the city, he stumbled upon a giant abandoned robot partially overgrown with plants but still accessible. Once inside, his curiosity got the better of him and he pulls an old power switch among a series of stasis tanks. In doing so, he awakened the five robotic monkeys that form the Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce. In the process Chiro also fused himself with the mysterious supernatural energy of the Power Primate, allowing him to transform into a stronger, braver fighter and the leader of the team. With the aid of the five Robot Monkeys: Sparx, Antauri, Gibson, Otto and Nova, their mission is to save Shuggazoom City from the Skeleton King, the main villain of the series, as well as any other evil forces that may threaten it.\n\nSince Chiro was not born a superhero, or with any enhanced abilities, the five Robot Monkeys take up training him to hone his abilities which results in him leading the team. With each member possessing a different set of skills Chiro acts as a unifying force keeping them on point where they otherwise might fall to differing opinions, in addition to being familiar with the current culture of Shuggazoom. With the monkeys continuing to train Chiro he grows into the leader they need with the potential to fulfill his greater destiny as protector of the universe.\n\nWhen fighting with larger enemies the Hyperforce uses the Super Robot, which can operate as a single entity or split into six separate vehicles for versatility. Its main attack, when combined as the whole robot, is Lasertron Fury. This powerful energy beam that is fired from its chest is capable of destroying large objects or hostile entities while an array of smaller weaponry is used to handle other lesser threats. The Super Robot also serves as Chiro and the Monkeys' headquarters and home while parked on its landing pad in Shuggazoom City.\n\nOver the course of the series the history of both Shuggazoom and the Robot Monkeys is expanded upon revealing they were created long ago specifically to combat the evil Skeleton King by a brilliant inventor known only as the Alchemist. Having unintentionally released a great evil into the world with his experiments the Hyperforce was his attempt to prepare for an uncertain future where defenses would be needed. The hyperforce itself also expanded as the series ran to include various allies and a rogues gallery of enemies as recurring characters.\n\nThe only city on the planet, Shuggazoom, Shuggazoom city is the home of the Hyperforce. Containing an array of business along with housing, parks, and open spaces the cityscape was sufficient to hide an entire robot from view or interest until it had become overgrown with plant life. The city is also built effectively on stilts above a large reservoir that extends miles downward giving it a steady supply of clean drinking water.\n\nA rocky desert located on the outskirts of Shuggazoom City that landscapes the rest of the planet Shuggazoom. The Pit of Doom is located here, as well as the deep gorge where the Hyperforce found Captain Shuggazoom.\n\nA tropical jungle hidden within a series of caves located beneath Shuggazoom's surface. The jungle contains large deposits of the black ooze that is used to create the Formless, and thus the environment is inhabited by various Formless creatures. It is likely that the Savage Lands were once occupied by some sort of ancient civilization, as it houses a great deal of seemingly ancient temples and tombs. One of these temples was used as Valeena's base of operations, which she ruled over the area from after receiving her powers from Skeleton King. The Alchemist's laboratory is also located here.\n\nA frozen plain located on Shuggazoom's North Pole that is occupied only by Morlath and his snow monsters.

Several automobile and related companies such as Delphi, Ford, Chrysler, and Toyota have also put extensive research into development of sensors. Many academic and government labs are pushing to develop the sensors as well. The term represents several forms of nitrogen oxides such as NO (nitric oxide), NO (nitrogen dioxide) and NO (nitrous oxide aka laughing gas). In a gasoline engine NO is the most common form of being around 93% while NO is around 5% and the rest is NO. There are other forms of such as NO (the dimer of NO), which only exists at lower temperatures, and NO, for example. However, owing to much higher combustion temperatures due to high cylinder compression and turbo or supercharging, diesel engines produce much higher engine-out emissions than spark-ignition gasoline engines do. The recent availability of Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) allows the properly equipped diesel engine to emit similar values of at the tailpipe compared to a typical gasoline engine with a 3-way catalyst. In addition, the diesel oxidation catalyst significantly increases the fraction of NO in \"\" by oxidizing over 50% of NO using the excess oxygen in the diesel exhaust gases.\n\nThe drive to develop a sensor comes from environmental factors. gases can cause various problems such as smog and acid rain. Many governments around the world have passed laws to limit their emissions (along with other combustion gases such as SOx (oxides of sulfur), CO (carbon monoxide) and CO (carbon dioxide) and hydrocarbons). Companies have realized that one way of minimizing emissions is to first detect them and then employ some sort of feedback loop in the combustion process, minimizing production by, for example, combustion optimization or regeneration of traps.\n\nDue to the high temperature of the combustion environment, only certain types of material can operate \"in situ\". The majority of sensors developed have been made out of ceramic type metal oxides, with the most common being yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), which is currently used in the decades-old oxygen sensor. The YSZ is compacted into a dense ceramic and conducts oxygen ions (O) at the high temperatures of a tailpipe such at 400 °C and above. To get a signal from the sensor a pair of high-temperature electrodes such as noble metals (platinum, gold, or palladium) or other metal oxides are placed onto the surface and an electrical signal such as the change in voltage or current is measured as a function of concentration.\n\nThe levels of NO are around 100–2000 ppm (parts per million) and NO 20–200 ppm in a range of 1–10% O. The sensor has to be very sensitive to pick up these levels.\n\nThe main problems that have limited the development of a successful sensor (which are typical of many sensors) are selectivity, sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, response time, limit of detection, and cost. In addition due to the harsh environment of combustion the high gas flow rate can cool the sensor which alters the signal or it can delaminate the electrodes over time and soot particles can degrade the materials.\n\n\nPrabir Dutta Research group at Ohio State University, USA, that develops combustion sensors, including .\nA research summary and\n"}

Most commonly, profiling information serves to aid program optimization.\n\nProfiling is achieved by instrumenting either the program source code or its binary executable form using a tool called a \"profiler\" (or \"code profiler\"). Profilers may use a number of different techniques, such as event-based, statistical, instrumented, and simulation methods.\n\nProfilers use a wide variety of techniques to collect data, including hardware interrupts, code instrumentation, instruction set simulation, operating system hooks, and performance counters. Profilers are used in the performance engineering process.\n\nThe output of a profiler may be:\n\n\n\nA profiler can be applied to an individual method or at the scale of a module or program, to identify performance bottlenecks by making long-running code obvious. A profiler can be used to understand code from a timing point of view, with the objective of optimizing it to handle various runtime conditions or various loads. Profiling results can be ingested by a compiler that provides profile-guided optimization. Profiling results can be used to guide the design and optimization of an individual algorithm; the Krauss matching wildcards algorithm is an example. Profilers are built into some application performance management systems that aggregate profiling data to provide insight into transaction workloads in distributed applications.\n\nPerformance-analysis tools existed on IBM/360 and IBM/370 platforms from the early 1970s, usually based on timer interrupts which recorded the program status word (PSW) at set timer-intervals to detect \"hot spots\" in executing code. This was an early example of sampling (see below). In early 1974 instruction-set simulators permitted full trace and other performance-monitoring features.\n\nProfiler-driven program analysis on Unix dates back to 1973, when Unix systems included a basic tool, codice_1, which listed each function and how much of program execution time it used. In 1982 codice_2 extended the concept to a complete call graph analysis.\n\nIn 1994, Amitabh Srivastava and Alan Eustace of Digital Equipment Corporation published a paper describing ATOM(Analysis Tools with OM). The ATOM platform converts a program into its own profiler: at compile time, it inserts code into the program to be analyzed. That inserted code outputs analysis data. This technique - modifying a program to analyze itself - is known as \"instrumentation\".\n\nIn 2004 both the codice_2 and ATOM papers appeared on the list of the 50 most influential PLDI papers for the 20-year period ending in 1999.\n\nFlat profilers compute the average call times, from the calls, and do not break down the call times based on the callee or the context.\n\nCall graph profilers show the call times, and frequencies of the functions, and also the call-chains involved based on the callee. In some tools full context is not preserved.\n\nInput-sensitive profilers add a further dimension to flat or call-graph profilers by relating performance measures to features of the input workloads, such as input size or input values. They generate charts that characterize how an application's performance scales as a function of its input.\n\nProfilers, which are also programs themselves, analyze target programs by collecting information on their execution. Based on their data granularity, on how profilers collect information, they are classified into event based or statistical profilers. Profilers interrupt program execution to collect information, which may result in a limited resolution in the time measurements, which should be taken with a grain of salt. Basic block profilers report a number of machine clock cycles devoted to executing each line of code, or a timing based on adding these together; the timings reported per basic block may not reflect a difference between cache hits and misses.\n\nThe programming languages listed here have event-based profilers:\n\nSome profilers operate by sampling. A sampling profiler probes the target program's call stack at regular intervals using operating system interrupts. Sampling profiles are typically less numerically accurate and specific, but allow the target program to run at near full speed.\n\nThe resulting data are not exact, but a statistical approximation. \"The actual amount of error is usually more than one sampling period. In fact, if a value is n times the sampling period, the expected error in it is the square-root of n sampling periods.\" \n\nIn practice, sampling profilers can often provide a more accurate picture of the target program's execution than other approaches, as they are not as intrusive to the target program, and thus don't have as many side effects (such as on memory caches or instruction decoding pipelines). Also since they don't affect the execution speed as much, they can detect issues that would otherwise be hidden. They are also relatively immune to over-evaluating the cost of small, frequently called routines or 'tight' loops. They can show the relative amount of time spent in user mode versus interruptible kernel mode such as system call processing.\n\nStill, kernel code to handle the interrupts entails a minor loss of CPU cycles, diverted cache usage, and is unable to distinguish the various tasks occurring in uninterruptible kernel code (microsecond-range activity).\n\nDedicated hardware can go beyond this: ARM Cortex-M3 and some recent MIPS processors JTAG interface have a PCSAMPLE register, which samples the program counter in a truly undetectable manner, allowing non-intrusive collection of a flat profile.\n\nSome commonly used statistical profilers for Java/managed code are SmartBear Software's AQtime and Microsoft's CLR Profiler. Those profilers also support native code profiling, along with Apple Inc.'s Shark (OSX), OProfile (Linux), Intel VTune and Parallel Amplifier (part of Intel Parallel Studio), and Oracle Performance Analyzer, among others.\n\nThis technique effectively adds instructions to the target program to collect the required information. Note that instrumenting a program can cause performance changes, and may in some cases lead to inaccurate results and/or heisenbugs. The effect will depend on what information is being collected, on the level of timing details reported, and on whether basic block profiling is used in conjunction with instrumentation. For example, adding code to count every procedure/routine call will probably have less effect than counting how many times each statement is obeyed. A few computers have special hardware to collect information; in this case the impact on the program is minimal.\n\nInstrumentation is key to determining the level of control and amount of time resolution available to the profilers. \n\n\n\n\n"}

The company was founded in 1968 in Maryville, Tennessee, and is currently headquartered in Vonore, Tennessee. MasterCraft boats are used in waterskiing, wakeboarding and wakesurfing, though the company has also produced several boats that are not focused on water sports.\n\nMasterCraft's founder Rob Shirley was a young waterskiing instructor who opened a waterskiing school in Florida 1965. In 1968, with the help of a few fellow waterskiers, he modified a Ski Nautique boat manufactured by Correct Craft. The boat was completed in August, and debuted at the U.S. Nationals in Canton, Ohio. In that same year Rob had to close the school and moved to his wife's parent's farm in Maryville, Tennessee. There he founded the MasterCraft Boat Company, which initially operated out of a two-horse barn.\n\nDuring its first year of operation, MasterCraft only built 12 boats using the modified hull design. The operating facility was moved to Vonore, Tennessee and now has approximately 600 employees As of 2006, MasterCraft produced over 3,000 boats per year, sold in 25 different countries by over 100 domestic and international dealers.\n\nSome of its most popular boats today are the Prostar series of direct drive ski boats, and the X-Series Wakeboard boats, many of which share hulls with the Prostar series, but come equipped with wakeboard-specific features such as ballast tanks and a wakeboard tower.

{"id": "2310087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310087", "title": "1905 Tour de France", "text": "1905 Tour de France\n\nThe 1905 Tour de France was the third edition of the Tour de France, held from 9 to 30 July, organised by the newspaper \"L'Auto\". Following the disqualifications after the 1904 Tour de France, there were changes in the rules, the most important one being the general classification not made by time but by points. The race saw the introduction of mountains in the Tour de France, and René Pottier excelled in the first mountain, although he could not finish the race.\nDue in part to some of the rule changes, the 1905 Tour de France had less cheating and sabotage than in previous years, though they were not completely eliminated. It was won by Louis Trousselier, who also won four of the eleven stages.\n\nAfter the 1904 Tour de France, some cyclists were disqualified, most notably the top four cyclists of the original overall classification, Maurice Garin, Lucien Pothier, César Garin and Hippolyte Aucouturier. Maurice Garin was originally banned for two years and Pothier for life, so they were ineligible to start the 1905 Tour de France. Of these four, only Aucouturier (who had been \"warned\" and had a \"reprimand inflicted\" on him), started the 1905 Tour. They were disqualified by the Union Vélocipédique Française, based on accusations of cheating when there were no race officials around. In 1904 Tour, it was difficult to observe the cyclists continuously, as significant portions of the race were run overnight, and the long stages made it difficult to have officials everywhere.\n\nBecause these disqualifications had almost put an end to the Tour de France, the 1905 event had been changed in important ways, to make the race easier to supervise:\nThe first cyclist to cross the finish line received 1 point. Other cyclists received one point more than the cyclist who passed the line directly before him, plus an additional point for every five minutes between them, with a maximum of ten points. In this way, a cyclist could not get more than 11 points more than the cyclist that crossed the finish line just before him.\n\nAs an example for this point system, the result for the first seven cyclists in the first stage is in this table:\n\nThe other important introduction were the mountains. One of Desgrange's staffers, Alphonse Steinès, took Desgrange for a trip over the Col Bayard at and the Ballon d'Alsace at , that had an average gradient of 5.2% with 10% at some places, to convince Desgrange to use these climbs in the route. Desgrange accepted it, saying that Steinès would take the blame if the mountains would be too hard to climb.{sfn|Laget|Bouvet|2005|pp=190–191} In the two previous editions, the highest point was the Col de la République at . In 1905, Desgrange chose to overlook this, and focused instead on the introduction of the Ballon d'Alsace, because he saw that he had missed the opportunity for publicity previously.\n\nThere were two categories of riders, the \"coureurs de vitesse\" and the \"coureurs sur machines poinçonnées\". The riders in the first category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. The riders in the machines poinçonnées category had to use the same bicycle in the entire race, and to verify this, their bicycles were marked.\n\nBefore the race started, 77 riders had signed up for the race. Seventeen of those did not start the race, so the Tour began with 60 riders, including former winner Henri Cornet and future winners René Pottier and Lucien Petit-Breton. The riders were not grouped in teams, but most of them rode with an individual sponsor. Two of the cyclists—Catteau and Lootens—were Belgian, all other cyclists were French. Leading up to the start of the Tour, Wattelier, Trousselier, Pottier and Augereau were all considered the most likely contenders to win the event.\n\nDespite the rule changes, there were still protesters among the spectators; in the first stage all riders except Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq punctured due to 125 kg of nails spread along the road. The first stage was won by Louis Trousselier. Trousselier was serving the army, and had requested his commander leave for the Tour de France; this was allowed for 24 hours. After he won the first stage and led the classification, his leave was extended until the end of the Tour. From 60 starting cyclists, only 15 cyclists reached the finish line within the time limit; 15 more reached the finish after the limit and the rest took the train.\nThe Tour organiser Desgrange wanted to stop the race, but was persuaded by the cyclists not to do so, and allowed all cyclists to continue with 75 points.\nIn the second stage, the first major climb, the Ballon d'Alsace, made its debut. Four riders were the fastest climbers: Trousselier, René Pottier, Cornet and Aucouturier. Of those four, Trousselier and Aucouturier were the first to be dropped, and Cornet had to drop in the final kilometers. The top was therefore reached first by René Pottier, without dismounting, at an average speed of 20 km/h. Cornet, who reached the top second, had to wait 20 minutes for his bicycle with higher gear, because his support car had broken down.\nLater Aucouturier caught Pottier, and dropped him, and won the stage. Pottier became second in the stage and led the classification. Seven cyclists did not reach the finish in time, but they were again allowed to start the next stage.\n\nIn the third stage, Pottier had to abandon due to tendinitis. The lead was back with Trousselier, who also won the stage.\n\nIn the fourth stage, the Côte de Laffrey and the Col Bayard were climbed, the second and third mountains of the Tour de France. Julien Maitron reached both tops first, but Aucouturier won the stage. Trousselier finished in second place, still leading the overall classification, although with the same number of points as Aucouturier.\n\nIn the fifth stage, Trousselier won, and because Aucouturier finished in twelfth place, Trousselier had a big lead in the general classification. After the fifth stage, Aucouturier could no longer challenge Trousselier for the lead.\n\nIn the seventh stage to Bordeaux, Trousselier punctured after only a few kilometers. The rest of the cyclists quickly sped away from him, and Trousselier had to follow them alone for 200 km. A few kilometers before Bordeaux, Trousselier caught up with the rest, and even managed to win the sprint. Louis Trousselier kept his lead until the end of the race, winning five stages. Trousselier was accused of bad sportsmanship: he reportedly smashed the inkstands of a control post to prevent his opponents from signing. Unlike the 1904 Tour de France, no stage winners, nor anyone from the top ten of the general classification, were disqualified.\n\nIn the first and last stage, the cyclists were allowed to use pacers. All the 11 stages were won by only three cyclists:\n\nThe cyclists officially were not grouped in teams; some cyclists had the same sponsor, even though they were not allowed to work together.\n\nPautrat was the winner of the \"coureurs sur machines poinçonnées\" category, having used the same bicycle through the whole event.\n\nThe organising newspaper L'Auto named René Pottier the \"meilleur grimpeur\". This unofficial title is the precursor to the mountains classification.\n\nThe tour organisers liked the effect of the points system, and it remained active until the 1912 Tour de France, after which it was reverted to the time system. In 1953, for the 50-years anniversary of the Tour de France, the points system was reintroduced as the points classification, and the winner was given a green jersey. This points classification has been active ever since.\n\nThe introduction of mountains in the Tour de France had also been successful. After the introduction of the Vosges in the 1905 Tour de France, in 1906 the Massif Central were climbed, followed by the Pyrenees in 1910 and the Alps in 1911.\n\nThe winner Trousselier received 6950 Francs for his victory. The night after he won, he drank and gambled with friends, and lost all the money. In later years, Trousselier would not win a Tour de France again, but he still won eight more stages and finished on the podium in the next year.\nThe unofficial mountain champion of the 1905 Tour de France, Pottier, would be more successful in the next year, when he won the overall classification and five stages.\n\nFor L'Auto, the newspaper that organised the Tour de France, the race was a success; the circulation had increased to 100,000.\n\n"}

He also made a significant contribution to motion picture theater architecture from the 1930s to 1950s. Gibbons designed the Oscar statuette in 1928, but tasked the sculpting to George Stanley, a Los Angeles artist. He was nominated 39 times for the Academy Award for Best Production Design and won the Oscar 11 times, both of which are records.\n\nCedric Gibbons was born in New York City in 1890 or 1893 (although conflicting reports have him born in Dublin, Ireland) to architect Austin P. Gibbons and Veronica Fitzpatrick Simmons. The couple raised him in the Brooklyn borough moving to New York City after the birth of their third child. Cedric studied at the Art Students League of New York in 1911. He began working in his father's office as a junior draftsman, then in the art department at Edison Studios under Hugo Ballin in New Jersey in 1915. He was drafted and served in the US Navy Reserves during World War I at Pelham Bay in New York. He then joined Goldwyn Studios, and began a long career with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1924, when the studio was founded.\n\nIn 1925, when he was first working in the art department at MGM, he was in competition with another talent, Romain De Tirtoff, for a more substantial position, while working with Joseph Wright, Merrill Pye and Richard Day on some 20 films. Tirtoff is better known as Erte. When studio executive Irving Thalberg summoned Gibbons to work on \"\" (1925), he used knowledge of the up-and-coming art moderne (that was to become known as art deco) to advance in the MGM art department.\n\nGibbons was one of the original 36 founding members of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and designed the Academy Awards statuette in 1928. A trophy for which he himself would be nominated 39 times, winning 11. The last time for Best Art Direction for \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\" (1956)\".\n\nHe retired from MGM as art director and the head of the art department on April 26, 1956 due to ill health with over 1,500 films credited to him; however, other designers did major work on these films, some credited, some were not, during Gibbons tenure as head of the art department. Even so, his actual hands-on art direction is considerable and his contributions lasting.\n\nIn 1930, Gibbons married actress Dolores del Río and co-designed their house with Douglas Honnold in Santa Monica, an intricate Art Deco residence influenced by Rudolf Schindler. They divorced in 1941. In October 1944, he married actress Hazel Brooks, with whom he remained until his death.\n\nGibbons niece Veronica \"Rocky\" Balfe was Gary Cooper's wife and briefly an actress known as Sandra Shaw.\n\nGibbons' second cousin Frederick \"Royal\" Gibbons—a musician, orchestra conductor, and entertainer who worked with him at MGM—was the father of Billy Gibbons of the rock band ZZ Top.\n\nOn July 26, 1960, after a long illness, Gibbons died in Los Angeles at age 70, and was buried under a modest marker, at the Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles. Dorothy Kilgallen, journalist and gossip columnist, also friend of his second wife, reported his age as 65 at the time of his death.\n\nGibbons' set designs, particularly those in such films as \"Born to Dance\" (1936) and \"Rosalie\" (1937), heavily inspired motion picture theater architecture in the late 1930s through 1950s. The style is also found in the theaters that were managed by the Skouras brothers, whose designer Carl G. Moeller used the sweeping scroll-like details in his creations.\n\nAmong the more classic examples are the Loma Theater in San Diego, The Crest theaters in Long Beach and Fresno, and the Culver Theater in Culver City, all of which are in California and some extant. The style is sometimes referred to as Art Deco and Art Moderne.\n\nThe iconic Oscar statuettes that Gibbons designed, which were first awarded in 1929, are still being presented to winners at Academy Awards ceremonies each year.\n\nIn February 2005 Gibbons was inducted into the Art Directors Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}

The two main characters are Michael Adair, an Irish-born officer in the colonial mounted troopers, and Daniel Carney, an Irish escapee and bushranger.

They ultimately decide on pledging a sorority. However, not many sororities are normal at South Beach University. The girls decide to pledge the most popular and exclusive sorority at the university, Gamma Gamma, which is led by president Victoria English.\n\nWhile pledging the sorority, Victoria sends the girls to do a task: collect used condoms. While searching the park, the leader of the group, Gloria, bumps into Victoria's boyfriend Derek, and they become close. The only reason Victoria plans to let the freshmen pledge is to display diversity, which is a requirement for the \"FHM Hottest Sorority in the Country\" contest. From then on, Victoria declares war on the girls during \"Hell Week\" but ultimately lets them join, only to kick them out once they have won the contest. This angers the leader of the misfit freshmen, Gloria. Gloria decides to quit the sorority as do her friends. Derek and Gloria realize their feelings towards each other and seal it with a kiss.\n\nGloria's ex-best friend, Kristen, convinces Gloria to come back. Gloria and her friends come back but only to declare war on Victoria by sneaking into the Gamma Gamma house and stealing embarrassing photos and video footage of her to show to everyone at the Gamma Gamma victory party.

Filming finished later that same year and a trailer was released on the film's official website. However, producers wanted \"Pledge This!\" to have an R-rating, which would allow more nudity in the film. Hilton disagreed with the proposal. More scenes with nudity were shot, thus pushing the film back to mid-2005.\n\nPost production was finalized at World Entertainment - LA in Los Angeles by Edward Oleschak.\n\nDue to the hurricanes that hit Florida in 2005, filming was delayed and then ultimately moved. This pushed the movie back to early 2006. Fans were confused that the trailer had proclaimed this film as \"Paris Hilton's film debut\" yet she had already appeared in 2005's \"House of Wax\". Finally in spring of 2006, it was announced that \"National Lampoon's Pledge This!\" would be released as an unrated DVD on December 19, 2006. It was also released on a rated R edition. Hilton missed the premiere of the movie in protest to the addition of the aforementioned nude scenes. Hilton said, \"I was so angry I snubbed my own premiere.\" In August 2008, Worldwide Entertainment Group Inc. sued Hilton in the Miami District Court, alleging she did not honor her contractual agreement to provide \"reasonable promotion and publicity\" for the film.\n\n\"Pledge This!\" has a 0% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 6 reviews, with an average score of 2.06 out of 10.\n\n"}

The vinyl edition was released on March 31, 1998, and the CD was released on April 7, 1998 through Columbia Records. The album was named after the ghost town of the same name in Oklahoma, where Cantrell's father grew up. In addition to singing, Cantrell also played guitar, piano, clavinet, organ, and steel drums on \"Boggy Depot\". Cantrell produced the album along with Toby Wright. Cantrell's Alice in Chains bandmates, Sean Kinney and Mike Inez are featured on the album, as well as Les Claypool, Pantera's Rex Brown, and Fishbone's Angelo Moore and John Norwood Fisher. \"Boggy Depot\" debuted at No. 28 on the \"Billboard 200\" and spent 14 weeks on the chart. The tracks \"Cut You In\", \"My Song\" and \"Dickeye\" were released as singles to promote the album. \"Cut You In\" peaked at No. 5. on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks, \"My Song\" reached No. 6 and \"Dickeye\" peaked at No. 36. \"Cut You In\" was nominated for two \"Billboard Music Video Awards\": Best Hard Rock/Metal Clip and Best New Hard Rock/Metal Artist Clip. \"Boggy Depot\" will be reissued on colored vinyl on December 13, 2019.\n\nIn 1996, after Alice in Chains opened for the first Kiss reunion show in Detroit, Jerry Cantrell began work on his first solo album. With the help of producer Toby Wright, whom he'd previously worked with in AIC, Cantrell worked on the album through 1997. Columbia originally gave a projected October 1997 release date which had to be postponed greatly. Early internet sources gave the tentative album title as \"Bogey Depot.\"\n\nIn February 1998, Cantrell spoke about the status of Alice in Chains and his new solo project to \"MTV News\":\n\nCantrell and Columbia launched his official website, JerryCantrell.com, in March 1998 to promote \"Boggy Depot\". This would feature song clips and the \"Cut You In\" music video. It also included QuickTime video interview footage where Cantrell explained that he had been wanting to venture into solo territory for a while and, with Alice in Chains at a standstill, finally had the chance. However, in the June 1998 issue of \"Guitar World\", Cantrell made it clear that his solo venture was actually a reluctant response to Alice in Chains' diffusing:\n\n\"Boggy Depot\" incorporates piano, organ, and country elements, namely in the tracks \"Hurt a Long Time\" and \"Between.\" Cantrell confirmed that as a child he was \"raised on country music\" and that he admires the strong emotion conveyed through the genre. However, the ominous guitar styles previously heard in Alice in Chains are undeniable in tracks like \"Jesus Hands\" and \"Keep the Light On.\" The tracks \"Settling Down\" and \"Hurt a Long Time\" were originally introduced during the recording sessions for Alice in Chains' self-titled album in 1995, but the group chose not to record them. As such, they were the oldest and longest-awaited songs to be introduced on \"Boggy Depot\". Although often mistaken as a song about Kurt Cobain's suicide, Cantrell stated that \"Hurt a Long Time\" is actually about the suicide of his cousin Kevin.\n\n\"Boggy Depot\" features both bassist Mike Inez and drummer Sean Kinney of Alice in Chains. This further incited fans to regard it as a \"lost\" Alice in Chains record or as a follow-up to their 1995 self-titled release. Three other well-known bassists also contributed to the album: Rex Brown of Pantera, John Norwood Fisher of Fishbone, and Les Claypool of Primus. Cantrell credited his relationships to some of these musicians to Lollapalooza '93 where their bands often collaborated on stage.\n\nA wide variety of equipment was utilized for the recording of \"Boggy Depot\". \nIn terms of amplifiers, Cantrell used the Peavey 5150 head given to him by Eddie Van Halen as well as Marshalls, Fenders, and Soldanos. The band used a lot of old RAT pedals and an Electro-Harmonix distortion on \"Jesus Hands.\" According to Cantrell, they also used \"vintage crappy mikes\" including one that Toby Wright bought for $20 at a pawn shop. Cantrell used largely the same guitars as he had in Alice in Chains, including the G&L Rampage, '52 Goldtop Les Paul, and old Stratocasters and Telecasters. He also bought Nancy Wilson's Les Paul Junior which he used heavily and satisfyingly played a new '50s-era Les Paul that Gibson sent him. Cantrell also intermixed guitars on certain songs; for instance, in \"Dickeye,\" a Goldtop was used for the left channel while his white Les Paul reissue went on the right.\n\n\"Boggy Depot\" was named after the ghost town of the same name in Oklahoma. This is the area Cantrell's father grew up in. The album cover, photographed by Rocky Schenck, depicts a placid Cantrell covered in mud standing in a branch of Clear Boggy Creek, a place he sometimes visits to hunt or fish. He detailed the choice in an interview:\n\nCantrell also designed the album's artwork. The booklet photography centers around rural Oklahoma. This includes a photo of Cantrell sitting on a porch with his great uncle, Victor Lane. The disc itself depicts Cantrell with hooks attached to his face with surgical adhesive. Strings attached to the hooks are being pulled, morbidly stretching his face.\n\nOriginally scheduled to be in stores on March 24, 1998, \"Boggy Depot\" was pushed back to release on April 7, 1998. A special 2-record vinyl edition of the album was released on March 31, 1998. \"Boggy Depot\" debuted at No. 28 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, selling more than 46,000 copies. The album stayed on the top 200 for 14 weeks.\n\nThe album received marginally positive and mixed reception from major publications. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine estimated that Cantrell was a reluctant solo artist who would prefer his work to be published through Alice in Chains. However, Erlewine claimed, \"everything that an Alice fan has loved [...] is here in spades.\" He detailed how guitar solos tend to drag songs too long and that, while \"Boggy Depot\" lacks the \"psychological weight\" of \"Dirt\", it \"comes close to replicating the sound.\"\nRob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" commended Cantrell's writing but gave a less enthusiastic review. He regarded it as the \"same reliably hook-y '70s metal album that Alice in Chains always made\" and \"basically Alice in Handcuffs.\" Sheffield also claimed \"'Breaks My Back' sounds exactly like Led Zeppelin's 'No Quarter' except it lasts eight seconds longer and fails to mention Thor. . . Nothing here would've sounded novel or Earth-shattering in 1978, let alone 1998, but Cantrell sure does know his trade.\"\n\n\"Billboard\" described \"Boggy Depot\" as similar to Cantrell's work in Alice in Chains and considered it \"an album that solidifies Cantrell's reputation as a singer/songwriter/performer in his own right.\"\n\nIn December 1999, \"The A.V. Club\"'s Stephen Thompson listed \"Boggy Depot\" as a nominee for Least Essential Solo Album in his article \"Least Essential Albums of the '90s.\" In April 2002, Thompson gave the album a mixed review, commending \"My Song\" and \"Between\" as the best tracks while regarding \"Dickeye\" and \"Devil By His Side\" as \"pedestrian.\" He elaborated on the overall sound as \"too much [...] like Alice in Chains minus a recognizable vocalist; in other words, a little bit like Creed and Days of the New.\" Thompson compared it to Scott Weiland's \"12 Bar Blues\" as another \"bad post-grunge solo album.\"\n\nThe promotion of \"Boggy Depot\" led to Jerry Cantrell's first concert experiences as a band frontman which he considered \"intimidating.\" On June 24 in West Palm Beach, Florida, Cantrell began touring for the album with Days of the New and headlining act Metallica on their Poor Re-Touring Me Tour. For his lineup, Cantrell enlisted former Queensrÿche guitarist Chris DeGarmo, Old Lady Litterbug bassist Nick Rhinehart, former Fishbone keyboardist Chris Dowd, and Alice in Chains drummer Sean Kinney. The band also opened for Van Halen on their 1998 summer tour. Naturally, Cantrell's concert set featured songs by Alice in Chains, and he often closed with Pink Floyd's \"Brain Damage/Eclipse.\"\n\nDespite Cantrell's uneasiness towards performing as frontman, concerts were quickly met with praise by critics from the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Variety\", and other major publications. The broad approval led Cantrell to schedule a headlining tour starting October 1 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Flight 16 filled the slot as his opening band.\n\n\"Cut You In\" served as \"Boggy Depot\"'s lead single and video which charted well and remained one of the album's best known songs. The track is unusual for Cantrell's style considering its use of horns. It was the #1 most added track at Rock and Alternative radio with more than 1,000 spins and an audience of more than nine million in its first five days. The second single, \"My Song\", was on \"Billboard\"'s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for over a dozen weeks. Its controversial music video was directed by Rocky Schenck and features performance artist Ann Magnuson. A third and final single, \"Dickeye,\" also managed to chart albeit briefly.\n\nOn July 19, 1998, Cantrell was interviewed for the MTV program \"120 Minutes\" which also aired the videos for \"Cut You In\" and \"My Song.\"\n\nBillboard Music Video Awards\nMusicians\nProduction\nAlbum – Billboard (North America)\nSingles – Billboard (North America)\n"}

The show featured host Boris Karloff introducing a mix of macabre horror tales and suspense thrillers.\n\n\"Thriller\" was created by Hubbell Robinson for MCA's Revue Studios. Though remembered primarily as a series that emphasized gothic horror, under producer Fletcher Markle \"Thriller\" was initially a series oriented towards suspense and crime drama, in the manner of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\". Markle was let go after having completed eight episodes, and replaced by Maxwell Shane. Shane continued in the crime drama mold, though he began to add trappings of gothic horror to a few stories, but he too was replaced after having completed a further nine episodes. The rest of the first season and all of the second was produced by William Frye, who firmly moved \"Thriller\" into the format for which it would be most well-remembered, although non-horror crime and mystery stories would still be featured from time to time throughout the show's run.\n\nAmong the many writers for the series were Donald S. Sanford, Robert Hardy Andrews, and Robert Bloch, who adapted a number of his own stories, notably \"The Weird Tailor\". Authors whose works were frequently adapted included August Derleth, Charlotte Armstrong and Cornell Woolrich.\n\nIn addition to serving as the host of the series, Karloff also starred in five episodes: \"The Prediction\", \"The Premature Burial\", \"The Last of the Sommervilles\", \"Dialogues With Death\", and \"The Incredible Doctor Markesan\".\n\nOther actors included Leslie Nielsen in the show's first episode \"The Twisted Image\", William Shatner in two episodes, \"The Hungry Glass\" and \"The Grim Reaper\", Constance Ford in two episodes, Mary Tyler Moore in two episodes, Henry Daniell in five episodes, and Edward Andrews in three episodes. Child actress Beverly Washburn appeared in \"Parasite Mansion\"; Joan Tompkins appeared in \"The Cheaters\" and \"Mr. George\". Elizabeth Montgomery, Tom Poston, and John Carradine in \"Masquerade\". Carradine also starred in \"The Remarkable Mrs. Hawk\", co-starring Bruce Dern and Jo Van Fleet; Ed Nelson starred in four episodes: \"The Fatal Impulse\", \"The Cheaters\", \"A Good Imagination\", and \"Dialogues With Death\".\n\nOther performers included: Rip Torn, George Grizzard, Natalie Trundy, Bethel Leslie, Patricia Medina, Patricia Barry, Richard Anderson, Richard Chamberlain, Elisha Cook, Conrad Nagel, Larry Pennell, Russell Johnson, Diana Millay, Philip Carey, Kathleen Crowley, Susan Oliver, Rodolfo Hoyos, Jr., J.

Hitchcock apparently did not want two similar one-hour shows on at the same time.\n\nIn a review of the anthology's 2010 DVD release, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said \"Not all the episodes work, and the transfers can be a bit grainy. But when they do—the strong shadows living in the black and white, the awesomely overwrought score by composers Jerry Goldsmith and Morton Stevens (if only they had music like that again), the storytelling not using gore and cheap scares as crutches—the results are genuinely goosebump-inducing.\"\n\nDue to a number of TV stations that pre-empted \"Thriller\" in favor of local programs, \"Thriller\" only ran for two seasons starting September 1960. A few minutes into each episode, Boris Karloff introduces the title of the episode, the \"major players\" (actors) in that episode, and states that \"as sure as my name is Boris Karloff, this is a thriller!\" Karloff also appeared as an actor in five episodes over the duration of the series.\n\nSeason 1: 1960–1961<br>\nThe show premiered on September 13, 1960 with the episode \"The Twisted Image\". It had 37 episodes in the first season (in addition to serving as the host of the series, Karloff starred in one episode in the first season: \"The Prediction\").\n\n<br>\nSeason 2: 1961–1962\n<br>\nThe second season of \"Thriller\" started on September 18, 1961 with the episode \"What Beckoning Ghost?\" and had 30 episodes in the season\n(in addition to serving as the host of the series, Karloff starred in four episodes in the 2nd season: \"The Premature Burial,\" \"The Last of the Sommervilles,\" \"Dialogues With Death,\" and \"The Incredible Doctor Markesan\").\nEach episode of the first season featured a specially composed score; the main theme and majority of writing was by Pete Rugolo, with additional compositions by Jerry Goldsmith and Morton Stevens. In 1961, The Original Music of Thriller, composed, arranged and conducted by Rugolo, was released on Bob Shad's Time label.\n\nAll compositions by Pete Rugolo.\n\n\n\nAfter a creative change during the first season, Rugolo was one of the crew to be removed (although his theme music was retained). Goldsmith and Stevens replaced him, scoring the rest of the run between them.\n\nThe British label Tadlow Music released two albums featuring several of Goldsmith's scores, re-recorded by City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Nic Raine.\n\nFirst Tadlow CD released in 2017:\n\n\nSecond Tadlow CD released in 2018:\n\n\nGold Key Comics published a comic book version of \"Thriller\", beginning in October 1962.\n\nThe title changed to \"Boris Karloff: Tales of Mystery\" after the TV series ended; the comic book series lasted until the very end of 1979, long after the death of Karloff himself. Dark Horse Comics published an archive reprint of the series beginning in 2009.\n\nOn August 31, 2010, Image Entertainment released \"Thriller: The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1. The 14-disc set contains all 67 episodes, remastered and uncut, with new commentary tracks and separated music tracks.\n\n"}

{"id": "2310159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310159", "title": "HiteJinro", "text": "HiteJinro\n\nHiteJinro Co., Ltd. (; ) is a distiller in South Korea, founded in 1924. It is the world's leading producer of soju, accounting for more than half of that beverage's domestic sales. It also manufactures a variety of other alcoholic beverages including red wine and whiskey. Distilleries are located in Icheon, Cheongwon, and Masan, with the Masan plant geared toward exports. In addition, Jinro produces the Soksu brand of bottled water at a factory in Cheongwon. Jinro has been involved in exporting since 1968, when it began shipping soju to Vietnam in the midst of the Vietnam War.\n\nJinro soju is known by the brand name Chamisul (), which is the world's most popular liquor. Part of their marketing strategy is to use temperature sensitive paper on their bottle label. A tab in the shape of an Asiatic Toad (the company's mascot) is white when the bottle is warm and becomes blue when the bottle is cold, indicating that the soju is ready to drink.\n\nIn 2006, the company was acquired by Hite, a popular beverage company whose main product is beer.\n\nThe target for 2014 sales are 2.2049 billion won, with an operating profit of 4.876 billion won; as a result, HiteJinro is expected to be the first liquor company in Korea to surpass 2 trillion won in sales.\n\nJinro has been named the top-selling spirit in the world in the Millionaires' Club 2016, after selling 73.8m 9-litre in the year 2015.\n\n\nJinro is the largest manufacturer of soju accounting for half of all white spirits sold in South Korea. Soju accounts for 97% of the category. Global sales in 2013 were 750 million bottles; the second-largest spirits brand, Smirnoff, sold less than half that number. The most popular variety of soju is currently Chamisul (참이슬 - literally meaning \"real dew\"), a quadruple-filtered soju produced by Jinro. Other brands include:\n\n\n\n\nOn October 19, 1998, Chamisul, which debuted in the domestic soju market, broke the common sense that soju is 25% ABV and changed the image of strong soju to \" soft and clean. \"It is the best brand of domestic soju. As a byword for soju following Jinro, Chamisul changed the history of the soju market in terms of quality, brand power, and sales volume.It's a breakthrough. \" Chamisul, \" which started out as a 23% ABV product when it was released, is now 20.1% ABV and 17.2 degrees% ABV. These two brands are leading the domestic soju market.\n\nChamisul, which has been gaining huge popularity by using bamboo charcoal filtration method when it was launched, has been renewing its products seven times.\n\nChamisul has become a byword for soju, a single brand with more than 50 percent of the national market in just two years.\n\nHitejinro’s product line which includes 6 beers, most notably the Hite label, 7 soju lines, to include the Korean favorite, Chamisul; 2 whiskey variations, and one wine, garnered them a sizeable market share. Hite Brewery Co., Ltd. is the leading player in the Korean alcoholic drinks market, generating a 50.2% share of these.\n\nJinro's brand of soju is the biggest-selling spirit in the world, according to a survey by the UK-based \"Drinks International\" magazine, easily outselling vodka and whisky brands last year.\n\nAverage adult annual consumption of spirits in South Korea is 9.57 liters, the world’s highest, according to 2005 data from the World Health Organization published last year. The Korean landscape of drinking has resulted in numerous street brawls, increased family violence and other crimes involving drinking. This prevalent problem is further exacerbated due to very minimal government punishment when a crime is committed with alcohol.\n\nDue to these occurrences, Hite-Jinro has begun putting warning labels on bottles of Chamisul and Beer products with messages reading: \"No more drunken violence! Let's improve wrong drinking culture!\"\n\n\"We felt tremendously responsible for social problems caused by drinking... we will help with efforts to change our drinking culture to a more positive one,\" said a sales manager at Hite-Jinro, quoted in Chosun Ilbo newspaper.\n\nSoju sales are soaring and foreign companies are considering buying into one of the few Korean industries to relish the economic crisis. But outsiders face tough, patriotic competition.\n\nWith HiteJinro's most notable drink, Soju, it has quickly gained momentum and popularity as a vodka substitute. The spirit, which is distilled from rice, barley, and koji, has become a popular import; though, with the company operating in Russia, the US, South Korea, China and Japan, the Korean giant has begun setting its sights on India with a new bottling deal.\n\nJinro actually went bankrupt during the Asian crisis of 1997, at which point it was bought by the Hite Corporation.\n\n"}

He writes for several newspapers, including \"The Washington Post\", \"The New York Times\", and \"The Wall Street Journal\", and has been published in magazines such as \"The Atlantic Monthly\" and \"Time\". Williams has worked as an editorial writer, an op-ed columnist, a White House correspondent, and a national correspondent. He is a registered Democrat. \nWilliams is the author of \"Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954–1965\" (1987), a companion to the documentary series of the same name about the Civil Rights Movement; \"Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary\" (2000), a biography of Thurgood Marshall, the first black American to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States; and \"Enough\" (2006), which was inspired by a Bill Cosby speech at an NAACP gala and deals with Williams' critique of black leaders in America. Williams has received an Emmy Award and critical praise for his television documentary work and he has won awards for investigative journalism and for his opinion columns. He has been at Fox News since 1997.\n\nWilliams was born in Colón, Panama, on April 10, 1954 to Alma Géraldine and Rogelio L. Williams. Williams' father was from the West Indies and his mother was from Panama. His family spoke Spanish. In a 2018 op-ed, Williams stated that he had legally emigrated from Panama to the United States in a banana boat with his mother and his two siblings when he was four years of age. The family settled in Brooklyn, New York. Williams received a scholarship to attend Oakwood Friends School, a Quaker school in Poughkeepsie, New York. While at Oakwood, he was clerk of the student body, editor of the student newspaper, and captain of the baseball, cross-country and championship basketball teams. After graduating from Oakwood in 1972, Williams attended Haverford College, graduating with a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1976.\n\nWilliams wrote for \"The Washington Post\" for 23 years.\n\nSome days after Williams wrote a column defending Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas against sworn testimony by Anita Hill charging sexual harassment by Thomas, it was revealed that several female employees of the \"Post\" had filed sexual harassment charges against Williams. The paper took disciplinary action against Williams and published an apology by him. On November 2, 1991, Williams wrote: \"It pained me to learn during the investigation that I had offended some of you. I have said so repeatedly in the last few weeks, and repeat here: some of my verbal conduct was wrong, I now know that, and I extend my sincerest apology to those whom I offended.\"\n\nWilliams joined NPR in 2000 as host of the daily afternoon talk show \"Talk of the Nation\". He then served as senior national correspondent for NPR. In 2009, NPR's President and CEO Vivian Schiller requested Fox News stop identifying him as an NPR host after Williams commented on \"The O'Reilly Factor\": \"Michelle Obama, you know, she's got this Stokely Carmichael in a designer dress thing going. If she starts talking...her instinct is to start with this blame America, you know, I'm the victim. If that stuff starts coming out, people will go bananas and she'll go from being the new Jackie O to being something of an albatross\". NPR Ombudsman Alicia Shepard maintained that: \"Williams tends to speak one way on NPR and another on Fox.\"\n\nNPR terminated his contract on Wednesday, October 20, 2010, two days after he made remarks on \"The O'Reilly Factor\". He had commented, \"Look, Bill, I'm not a bigot. You know the kind of books I've written about the civil rights movement in this country. But when I get on the plane, I got to tell you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb and I think, you know, they are identifying themselves first and foremost as Muslims, I get worried. I get nervous.\" According to NPR, the remarks were \"inconsistent with our editorial standards and practices, and undermined his credibility as a news analyst with NPR.\" As to the reason for the termination of Williams' contract, NPR's President and CEO Vivian Schiller offered the following comment: \"News analysts may not take personal public positions on controversial issues; doing so undermines their credibility as analysts...\" On October 21, 2010, Schiller told an audience at the Atlanta Press Club that Williams' feelings about Muslims should be between him and \"his psychiatrist or his publicist—take your pick.\" Schiller later apologized stating, \"I spoke hastily and I apologize to Juan and others for my thoughtless remark.\"\n\nSome observers have questioned whether NPR actually fired Williams for making the comments on Fox News, as opposed to making them in another forum. William Saletan of Slate.com compared the Williams situation to that of Shirley Sherrod, saying that both Sherrod and Williams had their words taken out of context in a way that made them appear racist and led to the loss of their jobs, except that Williams was victimized by liberals, rather than conservatives as in Sherrod's case. Saletan said that while Williams' confessed fears of Muslims were \"unsettling\", the context was Williams' argument that such fears should not be used to curtail the rights of Muslims or anyone else, and that Williams consistently argued that Muslims in general should not be blamed for the terrorist activities of Muslim extremists. NPR has been criticized by Williams and others for practicing a double standard in the firing, compared to their not firing Cokie Roberts, Nina Totenberg and other NPR reporters and analysts for their opinionated statements.\n\nWilliams has been a Fox News Contributor since 1997. He has appeared on \"Special Report with Bret Baier\", \"FOX News Sunday with Chris Wallace\" and regularly co-hosts \"The Five\". He also regularly appeared on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" and occasionally served as a guest host in O'Reilly's absence. After NPR announced his termination from their network in October 2010, Fox News offered him a new $2 million (a \"considerable\" raise) three-year contract and an expanded role at their network that included a regular guest-host role Friday nights on \"The O'Reilly Factor\".\n\nFollowing his firing from NPR, Williams appeared on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" and discussed his thoughts on how his role at Fox played into NPR's decision: \"I don't fit in their box. I'm not a predictable black liberal. You [O'Reilly] were exactly right when you said you know what this comes down to. They were looking for a reason to get rid of me because I'm appearing on Fox News. They don't want me talking to you.\" On December 9, 2016, on Fox Business Channel, Stuart Varney asked Williams (half in jest), \"Do you see yourself ever joining the Republican Party?\" Williams answered, \"I have two sons in the Republican Party, so, yes.\"\n\nWilliams is the recipient of an Emmy Award for his work in television documentary writing and has earned critical praise for a series of television documentaries including \"Politics: The New Black Power\", \"A. Philip Randolph: For Jobs and Freedom\", \"Civil Rights and The Press\", \"Riot to Recovery\" and \"Dying for Healthcare\".\n\nWilliams' 1988 book, \"Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954–65\", was written with the Blackside production team as a companion to the first season of the PBS series \"Eyes on the Prize\". His 2003 book, \"This Far by Faith\", is also a companion to a PBS series.\n\nWilliams is a contributor to a number of national magazines, including \"Fortune\", \"The New Republic\", \"The Atlantic Monthly\", \"Ebony magazine\", \"TIME\" and \"GQ\" and frequents a wide range of television programs including ABC's \"Nightline\", \"Washington Week\" on PBS, and \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\".\n\nWilliams has spoken at the Smithsonian's celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's \"Brown v. Board of Education\" decision, which ended legal segregation in public schools, and was selected by the United States Census Bureau as moderator of its first program beginning its 2010 effort. He has received honorary doctorates from Lafayette College, Wittenberg University, and Long Island University, among other institutions.\n\nA February 2013 column written by Williams for \"The Hill\" was found to contain content that had been plagiarized. Williams asserted that a researcher was responsible for the plagiarism and that he himself had been unaware of it.\n\nWilliams married Susan Delise in July 1978. They are the parents of one daughter, Rae, and two sons, Antonio (\"Tony\") and Raphael (\"Raffi\"). Tony, who was a Senate page and intern for GOP Senator Strom Thurmond from 1996 to 1997, was a speechwriter and legislative correspondent for Republican Senator Norm Coleman from 2004 to 2006; in 2006, Tony ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the Council of the District of Columbia, losing to Tommy Wells.

The festival presents jazz, R&B, and Calypso music.\n\nThe first St. Lucia Jazz Festival was held in 1992 as an initiative to extend the tourist season and increase foreign exchange in Saint Lucia into May which had previously been a relatively quiet period. It was inspired by the launching of the October Jazz Festival in 1991 spearheaded by Luther Francois as Musical Director. Originally 4 locations were used; however today the festival has expanded and several locations around the island are used to host performances (see list below). At first, the festival attendances were small. But as the years passed, word spread helped by coverage on the BET J television network, and it is now a well-established fixture on the Jazz festival calendar.\n\nIn 2011 the St Lucia Jazz Festival celebrated its 20th anniversary which was a rare achievement as several other Jazz festivals established in the Caribbean region had failed. More recently, in 2013, Saint Lucia Jazz was rebranded as the Saint Lucia Jazz & Arts Festival. The rebranding included a fashion show branded as Saint Lucia HOT Couture, the Cultural Explosion, Saint Lucia Sound Stage, and Blu Session - Word in an Altered Scale.

The team colours are sky blue, navy blue and gold. They play in the Queensland Wizard Cup, and, through their predecessors, are one of the oldest clubs in Australia.\nNorths have won 13 A Grade, 17 Reserve Grade and 14 Colts/Third Grade Premierships. They hold the record for most consecutive A Grade Brisbane Rugby League premierships, winning six in a row between 1959 and 1964.\n\nThe first incarnation of Northern Suburbs was the Past Grammars Rugby Union club, which was formed in 1891 as a separate Old Boys football club for Brisbane Grammar School.It shouldn't be confused with the school team known as Past & Present Grammar (made up of students, teachers & past students) which competed from 1888–90. The club was quite successful in its early years, winning premierships in 1892, 1898 and 1899, as well as 1914. Wallaby captain Bob McCowan was a Past Grammar played when he led the national side in 1899.\n\nFollowing the disbandment of club rugby union in Brisbane towards the end of the First World War, Past Grammars, along with Christian Brothers and University, joined the Rugby Football League in 1920 \n\nPast Grammars, also known as Grammar Norths, won their first premiership in 1927, before becoming Northern Suburbs, following the introduction of District Football by the Brisbane Rugby League in 1933.\n\nIn 1959 Clive Churchill (the little master) captain-coached Brisbane Rugby League club Norths to a premiership, his training methods were carried on by Bob Bax who coached Northern Suburbs RLFC to become the first club in BRL history to win three consecutive first grade premierships when they defeated Fortitude Valley 29–5 in the 1961 grand final in front of a record club crowd of 19,824 at Lang Park. Norths continued to dominate the decade with 7 grand final wins in 8 appearances. It would be another 11 years before they tasted success again.\n\nNorths' Queensland representative player Nick Geiger was selected as the Australia national team's hooker in the final of the 1977 Rugby League World Cup tournament.\n\nIn the 1990s, along with many other Queensland clubs, Norths suffered heavily financially. Eventually it came to the stage that in 1998 they became a feeder club with National Rugby League newcomers, the Melbourne Storm, which attracted much needed finance, as well as some quality players, as well as securing the Devils' future. Also in 1998, the club won its first First Grade premiership since 1980, beating Wests in the Grand Final.\n\nIn the 2006 NRL Grand Final Melbourne's 17 man team had 13 players who had played with Norths in past years, including Matt Geyer, who won a Premiership with the Devils in 1998 and Melbourne in 1999. In the 2006 Tri-Nations series, 4 Norths players graduated to the Australian Kangaroos squad and 2 players, via Melbourne Storm, represented New Zealand Kiwis.\n\nIn 2008 the Devils signed a partnership agreement with the Brisbane Broncos which sees developing Broncos players train with and compete for the Devils in the Intrust Super Cup. \n\nIn 2018 Rohan Smith was recruited to be the Head Coach of the club. In 2019 he led the Devils to the finals, with the team falling agonizingly short of progressing past the first round.\n\nFor many years Norths played out of Oxenham Park in Nundah, but they moved to their current home ground, Albert Bishop Park, in 1969. Commonly referred to simply as 'Bishop Park', it borders the Schulz Canal in Nundah, and is named after club stalwart Albert Bishop, MBE. Norths has a licensed Leagues Club, Norths Leagues, at Bishop Park, as well as a second licensed Club at Anzac Avenue, Kallangur, further north of Brisbane.\n\n\n\nOn 16 August 2008 in the year of the Centenary of Rugby League, Norths Devils announced their greatest team ever. The team is made up of players in their entire 75-year tenure.\n\n\nReserves:\n\nCoach:\n\nManager:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2310233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310233", "title": "Chain ganging", "text": "Chain ganging\n\nChain ganging is a term in the field of international relations describing the elevated probability for interstate conflict or conflagration due to several states having joined together in alliances or coalitions.\n\nThe agreed principles of such alliances typically include mutual defence clauses requiring that, in the case of one member state suffering military attack from another power, all members must declare hostilities against that offending power. The result of such an arrangement is an elevated probability for an international conflagration, since the case of an actor attacking another power would almost certainly trigger, whether intentionally or not, a multinational conflict potentially involving many more actors than the original two states which had attacked and been attacked, respectively. According to sworn agreements or treaties no member state has the option to refuse to participate in this involvement: once the states have agreed to the alliance, they are bound by obligation to join in the hostilities or conflagration as soon as they have begun in one state (though this obligation is not always honoured).\n\nAn empirical example of the chain ganging dilemma is World War I. When Italy decided to part from the Triple Alliance, both Austria-Hungary and Germany were alone for the most part in Europe (though Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire joined Austria-Hungary and Germany to form the Central Powers), and surrounded by the Allied Powers. The defeat of either of the two would severely weaken the remaining member. According to Kenneth Waltz, \"The defeat or defection of a major ally would have shaken the balance, each state was constrained to adjust its strategy and the use of its forces to the aims and fears of its partners.\"\n\nThe term is a metaphor deriving from chain gangs, groups of people, usually prisoners or slaves, bound together with chains or other devices as they work or march. Like a real-life chain gang, the states joined together in a chain gang, according to bound obligation, have no option to refuse to follow along with the intent of the others. However, in reality, the members of a chain gang coalition can and sometimes do choose to refuse to acquiesce, in which case they may face international ostracism (at least from the other members of their former alliance), and possibly courtship on the part of rival coalitions. This is because, typically, few punitive actions exists in the realm of international law that can sufficiently compel a power to follow its obligations at all costs, and therefore, the incentives to breaking ranks can sometimes be rather high, especially when the state does not agree with the actions taken by the other members of its coalition.\n\n"}
{"id": "2310244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310244", "title": "Souths Logan Magpies", "text": "Souths Logan Magpies\n\nThe Souths Logan Magpies, more commonly referred to by their former names Southern Suburbs Magpies, or South Brisbane Magpies, or often simply referred to as Souths, are a rugby league football club based in the southern suburbs of Brisbane, Australia. They play in the Intrust Super Cup, and although officially are a newer club (having been formed in 2003), they have roots tracing back (as Souths Magpies) to as early as 1910, the second year of rugby league in Queensland.\n\nThe first rugby league club to represent the southern side of the Brisbane River was West End, who entered the Queensland Rugby League premiership in 1910. Playing in an all black strip, the club won the 1913 premiership against Natives 5-3 in a low scoring game, and were runners-up to Valleys the following year, going down by 18–8. The West End Club played their last season in the Senior Grade in 1920.\n\nThe Carlton Football Club was founded in 1918 as a Junior Grade (Reserve Grade) Club to compete in the QRL competition. The club was founded by members of the Brothers Old Boys Junior Division (modern day Reserve Graders) along the same lines of the Merthyr Football Club Senior Division (modern day \"A\" Graders) in 1917. The members wanted to stay together and play football and since the QRU had abandoned Senior Football, they saw this as their only option.\n\nWhen the QRU Senior Grade competitions recommenced in 1919 the vast majority of the members of both the Merthyr and Carlton Clubs returned to play with the Brothers Club; however, a number of members decided to stay with the League Game and the name and colours of the Carlton Football remained with the QRL. The Carlton Club was also promoted to the Senior Grade of the QRL Competition.\n\nCarltons wore maroon and white jerseys, were a relatively successful club, winning the competition in 1921 (vs. Coorparoo 12–10), 1925 (vs. Coorparoo 24–5) and 1930 (vs. Valleys 19–8).\n\nFollowing the introduction of District Football in 1933 by the Brisbane Rugby League, Carltons were forced to relinquish their identity and as a result became known as Southern Suburbs. Souths inherited a debt of 90 pounds, and also suffered an exodus of players, resulting in doubts over their ability to field a first-grade team. However, newly elected President Jack Adams started the club with regular meetings under his West End clothing factory, which also made the club's first jerseys free of charge.\n\nDuring World War II, a lack of dyes for clothing forced the club to change jerseys, a problem that faced many clubs throughout Australia. Souths adopted the old West End jersey, and after the war chose to keep the design, and added a white V. (Southern Suburbs were known as the Lions up to the late-fifties, it was in the early sixties that they took on the Magpie logo) The war also saw them leave their spiritual home of Davies Park, which was first used in 1910, as it was used as housing for American servicemen in the city. Although they had an acute shortage of players, they continued to field teams, playing and training out of Musgrave Park in South Brisbane.\n\nSouths made their first grand final in 1942, however went down to Brothers 20-11. In 1945 they broke their premiership drought in most emphatic fashion, becoming the first club to clean-sweep the BRL in first, reserve and third grades. They also won two junior premierships in that same year. This was followed with more premierships in 1949, 1951 and 1953. Bill Tyquin, a product of Souths district, was captain-coach of the 1949 team, and went on to become an outstanding administrator and President of the club, as well as a delegate to the Brisbane Rugby League. As a tribute, the Bill Tyquin Oval at Davies Park was named after him.\n\nThe early 1970s saw the club in the doldrums of the league, as well as facing severe financial problems by the middle of the decade. However shrewd management and hard work saw an on-field revival, led by coach Wayne Bennett, resulting in the club making the 1979 Grand Final, although they were beaten 26-0 by Valleys. Bob McCarthy took over as coach in 1980, and guided the Magpies to another Grand Final loss, this time against underdogs Norths 17-15. But all would be forgotten in the euphoria of winning the 1981 title by defeating Redcliffe in the grand final with a spectacular try on the last play of the match.\n\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s saw Souths produce players such as Peter Jackson, Gary Belcher, and a young Brisbane Policeman who would go on to a glittering career as both a player and later a coach, Mal Meninga.\n\nIn the 1985 Brisbane Rugby League grand final, the Wayne Bennett-coached Souths side got a shock 10-8 win over Wally Lewis's Wynnum-Manly Seagulls, with John Elias being named man-of-the-match.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1985, Souths played in every BRL Grand Final at Lang Park other than 1983, almost dominating the league. The Magpies won two of the six Grand Finals they played during this period (1981 and 1985) while losing in 1979 (Valleys), 1980 (Norths), 1982 and 1984 to Wynnum Manly.\n\nIn 2002, it was widely speculated that Souths (again in deep financial trouble) would merge with the financially stricken Logan Scorpions, who had recently won the wooden spoon in what was their final season in the Queensland Cup. However, the merger did not eventuate with Souths acquiring the Logan club, renaming themselves Souths-Logan.\n\nThe Magpie crest, now synonymous with Brisbane Southern Suburbs, as it is shared by both Souths rugby league and rugby union, was formally adopted in 1968, after having the Magpies nickname for decades. By the second half of 20th century, however, Souths played in a predominantly white strip with two black Vs – one thick and one thin. During the Carltons years, and up until the forced change to a black jersey, the club wore cherry and white – now synonymous with the Redcliffe Dolphins.\n\nWhen Souths became Souths-Logan, they incorporated the blue and gold of Logan into their jersey design between the two Vs on club jersey. The lime green of the Canberra Raiders was added in 2004 to recognize their involvement with the club. Since cutting ties with the Raiders in 2014, the club has reverted to a predominately white and black colour scheme, with blue and gold as secondary colours.\n\nTheir home ground is traditionally Davies Park in Brisbane's West End, but they played all their 2006 home games out of Brandon Park, the junior club, located in Acacia Ridge. The Magpies moved back to Davies Park again in 2007.\n\nTraditionally, the Magpies home ground is Davies Park, although they did spend a time at Musgrave Park during World War II. Following the take-over of Logan Scorpions in 2003 the club split its home games between Davies Park and Logan's Meakin Park in Slacks Creek, although they had moved full-time to Davies Park by the end of the year. In 2004 all games were moved to Davies Park. In late 2005 the Magpies began moving matches to Brandon Park in Acacia Ridge, just opposite the Archerfield Airport, to be nearer Souths Juniors. In 2006 all games were played at Brandon Park. 2007 saw 6 of the 10 games back at Davies Park, with the remaining 4 at Brandon Park.\n\nPlayers who have worn the jerseys of South Brisbane 1908 to 1913, West End 1913 to 1926, Carlton 1926 to 1933, Souths 1933 onwards and represented their state totalled 80 of whom 33 Represented Australia.

He joined the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the following year.\n\nHe commenced working on ABC television's flagship public affairs program \"Four Corners\" in 1983 and has since become the program's longest serving reporter. His first program was the landmark \"Big League\", a 1983 investigation of judicial corruption, which helped bring about the Street Royal Commission.\n\nHe is a Gold Walkley Award winner, for his 1985 \"Four Corners\" report \"French Connections\" about the infamous sinking of the \"Rainbow Warrior\". Another famous \"Four Corners\" report by Masters, \"The Moonlight State\" from 1987, led to the Fitzgerald Inquiry into corruption in Queensland.\n\nIn 2004, he was appointed Adjunct Professor in Journalism with the School of Applied Communication at RMIT University and in 2006, RMIT awarded Masters an honorary doctorate in Communications.\n\nMasters was awarded the Public Service Medal on 14 June 1999 and the Centenary Medal on 1 January 2001 for \"service to Australian society in journalism\".\n\nHe serves on the national board of directors of the children's cancer charity RedKite\n\n\"Jonestown\" won the 2007 Queensland Premier's Literary Awards Literary Work Advancing Public Debate – the Harry Williams Award. It also won the 2007 Walkley Award for the best non-fiction book.\n\n\"No Front Line: Australia's Special Forces At War in Afghanistan\" was shortlisted for the 2018 Walkley Book Award.\n\nMasters has written four books. His first \"Inside Story\", published in 1992, told of the stories behind some of his \"Four Corners\" programs. His second, \"Not for Publication\", published in 2002, again dealt with his television work. His third book was called \"Jonestown\" and finally a book about the Australian soldier called \"Uncommon Soldier\".\n\nIn 2002, Masters profiled radio personality Alan Jones for an episode of \"Four Corners\", and then went on to write a biography titled \"\". On 29 June 2006, ABC Enterprises decided to cancel publication of Masters' manuscript; ABC Enterprises director Robyn Watts stated that publication was being withdrawn because it would \"almost certainly result in commercial loss, which would be irresponsible\". This was widely believed to be a veiled reference to the fact that Jones' lawyers had threatened an expensive defamation lawsuit if the book reached publication. ABC program \"Media Watch\" reported that the decision to cancel publication had been made not by ABC Enterprises but by the ABC Board. Many ABC personalities have criticised the Board's decision, and indeed wrote a petition against it, with signatories including Richard Glover and Phillip Adams.\n\nMike Carlton, a Sydney radio broadcaster and rival to Jones, suggested on 2UE during his show of 5 July 2006 that the book might detail homosexual encounters on Jones' part and Jones' lawyers had told the ABC that Masters' materials were \"replete with false and inappropriate sexual innuendo\". Certainly, in \"Jonestown\" Masters advances the theory that Jones' attempt to deny his sexuality is a defining feature of his personality, and provides an explanation for many aspects of his behaviour – including, for example, his interest in mentoring young male athletes. His explanation of much about Jones by reference to his sexuality left Masters open to charges of homophobia, which friendly commentators (in an ironic effort to defend Jones' reputation) have exploited.\n\nThe ABC's refusal to publish the book did not delay it for long; Masters had little difficulty in finding publishers willing to take it on, and Allen & Unwin released it in October 2006. Lengthy excerpts were also published in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\".\n\n\"Incomplete – to be updated\"\n\n"}

The temple is visited by more than 7 million pilgrims each year. As of 2011, the town had a population of 70,467.\n\nThe town derive its name from the compounding of two Tamil words \"pazham\" meaning \"fruit\" and \"nee\" meaning \"you\", a reference to poet Avvaiyar's song praising Lord Muruga which forms part of the legend of the Palani Murugan temple. Palani is pronounced using the retroflex approximant \"ɻ\" (ழ) and is thus also spelt using the 'zh' digraph as \"Pazhani\".\n\nReferences to the place exist in ancient Tamil devotional texts. According to Hindu mythology, \"Sage Narada once visited the celestial court of Lord Sivan at Mount Kailash to present to Him a fruit, the \"gyana-pazham\" (literally, the fruit of knowledge), that held in it the elixir of wisdom. Upon Lord Sivan expressing his intention of dividing the fruit between his two sons, Ganesha and Muruga, the sage counselled against cutting it. He decided to award it to whomever of his two sons first circled the world thrice. Accepting the challenge, Lord Murugan started his journey around the globe on his mount peacock. However, Ganesha, who surmised that the world was no more than his parents Shiva and Shakti combined, circumambulated them\". Pleased with their son's discernment, Lord Shiva awarded the fruit to Lord Ganesha. When Murugan returned, he was furious to learn that his efforts had been in vain. He left Kailash and took up his abode in Palani hills in South India. It is believed that Murugan felt the need to get matured from boyhood and hence chose to remain as a hermit and discarded all his robes and ornaments. He went into meditation to know about himself.\n\nPalani and most of Dindigul district were part of the Kongu Nadu region of the Tamil country. The northern part of the Palani and Oddanchatram taluks is held to have been part of the Anda Nadu sub-region, whereas the rest of the area constituted the Vaiyapuri Nadu. The area was under the influence of the rulers of Coimbatore and Madurai, at various points of time. In the 18th century, Hyder Ali and his son, Tippu Sultan ruled over the place before being annexed the British after the Third Anglo-Mysore War.\n\nPalani is home to one of the most sacred shrines of the Lord Muruga, as worshiped in the Hindu sect of \"Kaumaram\". The Thandayudhapani Temple dedicated to Lord Murugan \"Palani Andavar\", and regarded one of his \"Arupadai Veedu\" (Six Battle Camps), is situated here. The temple is situated atop a hill known as Sivagiri. The \"Garbagriham\" is surmounted by a gold \"gopuram\" and the walls of the Garbagriham have numerous stone inscriptions describing offerings made by devotees to the temple. Steps are hewn into the rock, besides a wide path meant for the ascent of elephants, up the hill. In addition, a winch pulled railway with three tracks and a rope way are operational. A temple is dedicated to Murugan near the foot of the hill by the name of \"Thiru Avinan kudi\" which actually forms a part of the six abodes of Muruga (Arupadaiveedu). It is also called as Kulandai Velayudhaswami Thirukkovil.\n\nBesides this, right at the foot of the Sivagiri is a small shrine dedicated to the god Ganapathi, where he goes by the name \"Pada Vinayakar\". It is customary amongst the pilgrims to pay their obeisances at this shrine before commencing their ascent of the hill.\n\nHalfway up the hill, there is the Idumban shrine where every pilgrim is expected to offer obeisance to Idumban before entering the temple of Dandayudhapani. The practice of Pilgrims to Palani bringing their offerings on their shoulders in a kavadi is associated with the legend of Idumban.\n\nWithin the town is another temple dedicated to the Goddess Parvathi as \"Periyanayaki Amman\". Near the Periya Nayaki Amman temple are two others - the \"Mariyamman\" Temple and the \"Perumal\" Temple. The former is particularly resorted to in times of epidemics, the goddess there being regarded as the protector against illnesses.\n\nA short distance from the town is a temple dedicated to Shiva as \"Periya Avudaiyar\".\n\nThe Kannadi Perumal Temple, dedicated to Vishnu, is a small temple situated on a hillock 9 km south of Palani, a short distance from the highway to Kodaikanal.\n\nThe backdrop to the town is formed by an offshoot of the Western Ghats, the Palani Hills, whereon lies the hill-station of Kodaikanal. The view within the town is dominated by the two hills, Sivagiri and Sakthigiri, on the former of which lies the temple. At the foot of the hills lie several lakes which drain to the Shanmuga river, a tributary of the Amaravathi River (itself a tributary of the Kaveri River), which takes its source on the slopes of the Palani Hills.<br>The nearest towns are Oddanchatram , Dharapuram, Udumalaipettai.\nAccording to 2011 census, Palani had a population of 70,467 with a sex-ratio of 1,023 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929. A total of 6,467 were under the age of six, constituting 3,283 males and 3,184 females. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes accounted for 16.57% and .23% of the population respectively. The average literacy of the town was 78.95%, compared to the national average of 72.99%. The town had a total of 19015 households. There were a total of 27,150 workers, comprising 372 cultivators, 1,277 main agricultural labourers, 763 in house hold industries, 23,478 other workers, 1,260 marginal workers, 40 marginal cultivators, 68 marginal agricultural labourers, 107 marginal workers in household industries and 1,045 other marginal workers. As per the religious census of 2011, Palani had 84.71% Hindus, 12.4% Muslims, 2.44% Christians, 0.01% Sikhs, 0.01% Buddhists, 0.42% following other religions and 0.02% following no religion or did not indicate any religious preference.\n\nNational Highway NH 83 connects Coimbatore to Nagapattinam via Palani \nTiruchirappalli Thanjavur. Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Limited TNSTC buses connect the town to other parts of the state. KSRTC buses connecting places like Kottayam, Kozhikode, Kasaragod, Guruvayur, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, and kottarakara are available at particular interval of time from Palani bus stand. 24 hours buses are available on all three main roads (via Dharapuram, Oddanchatram and Udumalaipettai)\n\nStation Code :PLNI, Palani is a part of the Coimbatore-Rameswaram BG line prior to the commencing of gauge conversion. On 20 November 2012, the Dindigul-Palani section of the line was completed, and the local railway station opened to railway traffic again. Currently there are passenger trains are crossing from Madurai, Thiruchendur to Coimbatore, Palakkad. And a daily express train train available between Palani to Chennai. Recently Amritha express running from Madurai - Thiruvananthapuram via Dindigul , Palani, Pollachi , Palakkad , Ernakulam , Kottayam, Kollam.\n\nThe nearest major airports are Coimbatore International Airport located from Palani and Madurai International Airport located at from Palani.

Hastings came from a colonial Yankee background, his ancestor Thomas Hastings having come from the East Anglia region of England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634. Hastings's father was president of the Union Theological Seminary. His grandfather, also named Thomas Hastings, was the composer of the hymn \"Rock of Ages\". He married Helen Benedict of Greenwich, Connecticut.\nHastings abandoned his college preparation courses to work with the chief designer at Herter Brothers, the premier New York furnishers and decorators. He later traveled to Paris to study in the atelier of Louis-Jules André, returned to the U.S. to found the firm of Carrère and Hastings with John Merven Carrère. Their first major commissions came from a parishioner of Hastings' father, Florida developer Henry Flagler. The partners undertook two hotels for Flagler, the Ponce de Leon Hotel (1885–1888) in St. Augustine, Florida (now part of Flagler College) and the Hotel Alcazar (now the Lightner Museum), followed by a succession of St. Augustine hotels and churches.\n\nThe firm's most famous project was undoubtedly the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street--not only an important example of its type but one of New York's most recognizable landmarks. They were also instrumental in creating the profession of urban planning, with Carrére's influential designs for Cleveland, Hartford and Atlantic City. Their varied work included the Manhattan Bridge (1899), the House and Senate Office Buildings in Washington, and Blairsden, the C. Ledyard Blair estate in Peapack, New Jersey (1896), one of the nation's greatest country houses.\n\nAfter Carrère's death in 1911, Hastings went on to design the Arlington Cemetery Tomb of the Unknowns and the Henry Clay Frick House on Fifth Avenue, as well as residences for such distinguished names as Guggenheim, duPont, Harriman, even a 'poultry cottage' for William K. Vanderbilt. He also designed the Fort Washington Presbyterian Church (1913). He designed the 435-foot (132.59 m) tall Tower of Jewels, the centerpiece of San Francisco's 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. After World War I, Hastings designed Kumler Chapel at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio in 1917-18, and designed the American Monument in Meaux, France, that memorialized the defeat of Germany at the Second Battle of the Marne, finally completed in 1932 after Hastings' death.\n\nHastings was a founding member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, serving from 1910 to 1917. In 1906, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1909.\n\nHastings outlived the Beaux-Arts world. Though he dressed up the Manhattan Bridge in a Beaux-Arts skin and helped clad conservative office buildings in Roman masonry, he denounced skyscrapers as \"bad in style, definitely bad for city traffic and the health of the citizenry\". He felt a zoning law should have been passed to limit their height to a maximum of eight stories as has been done successfully in Paris.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2310279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310279", "title": "Mad Love (1935 film)", "text": "Mad Love (1935 film)\n\nMad Love (also released as The Hands of Orlac) is a 1935 American horror film, an adaptation of Maurice Renard's novel \"The Hands of Orlac\". It was directed by German-émigré film maker Karl Freund, and stars Peter Lorre as Dr. Gogol, Frances Drake as Yvonne Orlac and Colin Clive as Stephen Orlac. The plot revolves around Doctor Gogol's obsession with actress Yvonne Orlac. When Stephen Orlac's hands are destroyed in a train accident, Yvonne brings him to Gogol, who claims to be able to repair them. As Gogol becomes obsessed to the point that he will do anything to have Yvonne, Stephen finds that his new hands have made him into an expert knife-thrower.\n\n\"Mad Love\" was Freund's final directorial assignment and Lorre's American film debut. Critics praised Lorre's acting, but the film was unsuccessful at the box office. Film critic Pauline Kael found the film unsatisfactory, but argued that it had influenced \"Citizen Kane\". Cinematographer Gregg Toland was involved in the production of both films. \"Mad Love\"'s reputation has grown over the years, and it is viewed in a more positive light by modern film critics, gaining the status of cult classic.\n\nActress Yvonne Orlac (Frances Drake) rests after her final performance at the 'Théâtre des Horreurs' (styled after the Grand Guignol) in Paris, France. As she listens to her husband Stephen Orlac (Colin Clive) play the piano on the radio, she is greeted by Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre), who has seen every show featuring Yvonne, and unaware of her marriage, is aghast to learn that she is moving to England with her husband. Gogol leaves the theater heartbroken, buys the wax figure of Yvonne's character, refers to it as Galatea (from the Greek myth), and arranges that it be delivered to his home the following day.\n\nStephen Orlac is on a train journey from Fontainebleau to Paris, where he sees murderer Rollo the Knife-Thrower (Edward Brophy), who is on the way to his execution by guillotine. (Gogol later witnesses the execution, along with the American reporter Reagan (Ted Healy). Orlac's train crashes later that night, and Yvonne finds her husband with mutilated hands. She takes Stephen to Gogol in an attempt to reconstruct his hands, and Gogol agrees to do so. Gogol uses Rollo's hands for the transplant, and the operation is a success.\n\nThe Orlac couple are forced to sell many of their possessions to pay for the surgery, while Stephen finds he is unable to play the piano with his new hands. When a creditor comes to claim the Orlacs' piano, Stephen throws a fountain pen that barely misses his head. Stephen seeks help from his stepfather, Henry Orlac (Ian Wolfe). Henry denies the request, upset that Stephen did not follow in his line of business as a jeweler. A knife thrown in anger by Stephen misses Henry, but breaks the shop front's window. Gogol meanwhile asks Yvonne for her love, but she refuses. Stephen goes to Gogol's home and demands to know about his hands, and why they throw knives. Gogol suggests that Stephen's problem comes from childhood trauma, but later confirms to his assistant Dr. Wong (Keye Luke) that Stephen's hands had been Rollo's.\n\nGogol then suggests to Yvonne that she get away from Stephen, as the shock has affected his mind and she may be in danger. She angrily rejects Gogol, whose obsession grows. Henry Orlac is murdered, and Stephen receives a note that promises that he will learn the truth about his hands if he goes to a specific address that night. There, a man with metallic hands and dark glasses claims to be Rollo, brought back to life by Gogol. Rollo explains that Stephen's hands were his, and that Stephen used them to murder Henry. He also claims that Gogol transplanted his (Rollo's) head on to a new body...flashing a leather-and-metal neck brace as \"proof!\"\n\nStephen returns to Yvonne and explains that his hands are those of Rollo, and that he must turn himself in to the police. A panic-stricken Yvonne goes to Gogol's home, and finds him completely mad (after he has come home and shed his elaborate disguise). Gogol assumes that his statue has come to life, embraces her, and begins to strangle her. Reagan, Stephen and the police arrive, but are only able to open the observation window. Stephen produces a knife and throws it at Gogol, then finds his way in. Gogol dies as Stephen and Yvonne embrace.\n\n\nFlorence Crewe-Jones provided MGM with an original translation/adaptation of Renard's story \"Les Mains D'Orlac\". Writer Guy Endore, who worked with director Karl Freund on early drafts. Producer John W. Considine Jr. assigned the continuity and dialogue to P.J. Wolfson, and John L. Balderston began to write a \"polish-up\" of the draft on April 24, 1935. Balderstone went over the dialogue with Lorre in mind, and at points called for the actor to deploy his \"\"M\" look\". Balderston continued his re-write three weeks past the start of filming.\n\nFilming started on May 6, 1935 with Chester Lyons as the cinematographer. Freund insisted on Gregg Toland, whom he got for a reported \"8 days of additional photography\". Actress Frances Drake recalled difficulty between Freund, Toland and Considine. Drake said that \"Freund wanted to be the cinematographer at the same time\", and that \"You never knew who was directing. The producer was dying to, to tell you the truth, and of course he had no idea of directing.\" Several titles for the film were announced, and on May 22, 1935, MGM announced that the title would be \"The Hands of Orlac\". \"The Mad Doctor of Paris\" was also suggested, but the studio eventually settled on the original title of \"Mad Love\". Shooting finished on June 8, 1935, one week over schedule. After the initial release, MGM cut about fifteen minutes of scenes from the film. Cut scenes included the surgery to get Rollo's hands, a pre-credit warning scene similar to the one in \"Frankenstein\", and Isabel Jewell's entire portrayal of the character Marianne.\n\n\"Mad Love\" was released in the United States on July 12, 1935 and, as \"Hands of Orlac\", in the United Kingdom on August 2, 1935. Official reaction in the UK was mixed with Edward Shortt of the BBFC initially declaring his intention to ban the film. The initial critical reception, however, was focused on praise for Lorre's performance. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said that \"Lorre triumphs in a characterization that is sheer horror\", \"Time\" magazine called him \"perfectly cast\", Graham Greene described his performance as \"convincing\", and Charlie Chaplin called him \"the greatest living actor\". Reviews for the rest of the cast were less positive. \"The New York Times\" said that \"Ted Healy, a highly amusing comedian, has gotten into the wrong picture\", and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said that Colin Clive \"jitters his way through\". \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote that the film was \"neither important or particularly compelling ... falls right in the middle between Art and Box Office\". \"Time\" magazine called it \"completely horrible\", and \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"\"Mad Love\" is not much more than a super-Karloff melodrama, an interesting but pretty trivial adventure in Grand Guignol horror.\" \"Mad Love\" was not a hit at the box office, and had a small domestic gross of $170,000. Its foreign gross was larger, at $194,000.\n\nCritic Pauline Kael's essay \"Raising Kane\", published in \"The New Yorker\", accused director Orson Welles of copying the visual style of \"Mad Love\" for \"Citizen Kane\". Kael noted that both Gogol and Kane are bald, Gogol's house and Kane's \"Xanadu\" are similar, and that Gogol and Kane both have a pet cockatoo. She also wrote that Toland had \"passed Freund's technique onto Welles\". Peter Bogdanovich wrote a rebuttal to Kael's statements in \"Esquire\" in 1972. Both writers had negative views on \"Mad Love\". Kael called it a \"dismal static horror movie\", and Bogdanovich said that it was \"one of the worst movies I've ever seen.\"\n\nRecent reviews of \"Mad Love\" have been much more positive. At the online film review database Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 100% approval rating, and a 7.5 critical average.\n\nBill Hader introduced a screening of the film at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood at the TCM Festival in April 2019.\n\n\"Mad Love\" was released on VHS by MGM/UA in late 1992 in the United States. It was released on DVD by Warner Home Video on October 10, 2006, along with \"Doctor X\", \"The Devil-Doll\", \"Mark of the Vampire\", \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" and \"The Return of Doctor X\", in the six-disc \"Hollywood Legends of Horror Collection\". DVD bonus material included film commentary by Steve Haberman, and the film's theatrical trailer.\n\n\"Mad Love\" was preceded by the 1924 Austrian silent film \"The Hands of Orlac\", directed by Robert Wiene and starring Conrad Veidt. It was remade in 1960 as a French-British co-production entitled \"The Hands of Orlac\", that was directed by Edmond T. Gréville, and starred Mel Ferrer as Stephen Orlac and Christopher Lee as a new magician character named Nero.\n\nRelated films include \"Hands of a Stranger\" (1962) and \"The Crawling Hand\" (1963). One of Alfred Hitchcock's unproduced projects was \"The Blind Man\", a variant of the theme in which a blind pianist receives implanted eyes whose retinas retain the image of their previous owner's murder. The Quinn Martin anthology TV series, \"Tales of the Unexpected\" includes the episode \"A Hand for Sonny Blue\", rehashing the theme once again.\n\n\n\n"}

They competed in the Brisbane Rugby League from 1934 to 1996. From 1996 they have competed in the Queensland Cup. Their jersey is traditionally an all gold jersey with two black 'V's. In recent years they have included white in their jersey. In 2019 the club introduced the original single black 'V' to its jersey and branding.\n\nEasts had competed as Coorparoo in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership from 1917. A highlight of the 1920s was the signing of South Sydney star, Harold Horder as their captain-coach in 1924 and 1925. With the move to district football in 1933 a new club, the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League club, was formed.\n\nThe club struggled on the field during the 1930s and 1940s and was in severe financial trouble. Between 1937 and 1945 the Easts Tigers won just nine of ninety matches, and suffered three winless seasons in 1940, 1944 and 1945. However, in 1946, the club was successfully revived after suffering many defeats during the war years with the re-election of A.G. (Taffy) Welch as club president and the implementation of a completely new management committee. In 1946 no less than twelve teams were registered with the Brisbane Rugby League. Of these teams, ten were semi finalists and seven made the grand finals. The main object was to present to the public a really strong first grade team. The next year, 1947, saw what would probably be the greatest side fielded by the club. Every trophy competed for in the BRL competition and Premiership were won and had no fewer than eleven players selected for Brisbane’s Bulimba Cup team.\n\nThe Easts Tigers won their next premiership in 1950, and in 1951 the Easts Tigers contested the Grand Final being beaten by Southern Suburbs, This meant that, since the revival of the club in 1946, they had played six grand finals in succession. They reached the semis in 1952 and the grand final in 1953 where they were again beaten by Souths. In 1954, they failed to make the top four so, for the first time in eight years they failed to compete in the semi-finals. The club was to win the Peter Scott Memorial Trophy in the 1960 season but did not have success again until they won the pre-season competition in 1969.\n\nThe 15-year premiership drought forced club officials to search for a top coach and in 1965 former international, Clive Churchill was engaged to try to mould the team into a premiership 13. The effect was the club’s appearance in the 1968 Grand Final against Past Brothers. Although they lost the Grand Final it sparked a resurgence in the Easts Tigers' performance for years to come and the Easts Tigers won the Woolworths pre-season competition in 1969.\n\nThe coach, Ted Verrenkamp, and his successor, captain-coach Des Morris, brought great success to the club providing the Easts Tigers with numerous finals appearances and Grand Final victories throughout the 1970s. This was through the help of arguably the best Queensland Five-eighth before King Wally, Wayne Lindenberg and the local junior talent highlighted by John Lang..\n\nIn the Queensland Wizard Cup era, the Easts Tigers have made the Grand Final five times although having lost all matches, the first to the Redcliffe Dolphins in 1997 then losing to the Burleigh Bears in a memorable extra-time final in 2004. They were defeated again in 2013 by Mackay and the next year by the Northern Pride. 2018 saw the disappointment continue as they lost to the Redcliffe Dolphins.\n\nThe Club is currently led by President, Keith Philips and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Torpy. In 2008, the year of the centenary of rugby league in Australia, the Club celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary.\n\nOn 20 January 2011, through BASES Productions, a family run entertainment group. The Easts Tigers began transmission of a fan-service to help boost the profile of the club and its players called TigerTV, in 2012 TigerTV began live broadcasting of entire matches via the internet; TigerTV has been regularly hosting live stream events of the Easts Tigers with Commentators Mike Higgison, Warren Boland, Gavin Payne, and David Wright. On 6 November 2016, TigerTV transitioned to a 24/7 Streaming Channel with Live and Recorded programming streaming continuously, along with replays and highlights of previous years. On May 1, 2018, play by play commentator Mike Higgison died. TigerTV has paid tribute to Higgison for his contributions in the club, and in Rugby League history. His relief and subsequent replacement is David Wright taking place as play by play commentator.\n\nIn 2018, the Easts Tigers rallied towards the end of the season, eventually winning each of the semi-finals, but when confronting old time rival, Redcliffe Dolphins in the Grand Final, the Easts Tigers ultimately came runners-up.\n\n2019 has seen a change in the team line up, with a lot of the juniors and colts moving up to take the club forward, with a dominant first 5 rounds of the QRL competition, they have proven still a strong side, with finals hopes still alive by round 19.\n\nHead Coach Scott Sipple was announced by the club to not returning for Season 2020.\n\nThe Easts Tigers were the last team in the Queensland Cup to follow the trend of becoming affiliated with a team from the National Rugby League. After relationships with Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and the Penrith Panthers, at the end of the 2006 NRL season the New South Wales club South Sydney Rabbitohs announced an alliance with the Easts Tigers as a feeder club for the National Rugby League (NRL) side.\n\nAt the end of the 2007 season it was announced that the Rabbitohs and the Easts Tigers would no longer be affiliated due to various conflicting issues, the Easts Tigers instead looked closer to home and struck an affiliate deal with the Brisbane Broncos.\n\nAt the end of the 2010 NRL season the Victorian club Melbourne Storm announced an alliance with the Easts Tigers as a feeder club for their NRL side. The partnership with the Easts Tigers allowed the Melbourne Storm to tap into the Easts Tigers' recruitment and development systems in Queensland, as well as providing a club for young Queenslanders recruited by the Melbourne Storm to play at and develop without having to relocate to Melbourne.\n"}
{"id": "2310294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310294", "title": "Fetal bovine serum", "text": "Fetal bovine serum\n\nFetal bovine serum (FBS) comes from the blood drawn from a bovine fetus via a closed system of collection at the slaughterhouse. Fetal bovine serum is the most widely used serum-supplement for the in vitro cell culture of eukaryotic cells. This is due to it having a very low level of antibodies and containing more growth factors, allowing for versatility in many different cell culture applications.\n\nThe globular protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), is a major component of fetal bovine serum. The rich variety of proteins in fetal bovine serum maintains cultured cells in a medium in which they can survive, grow, and divide.\n\nFBS is not a fully defined media component, and as such may vary in composition between batches. As a result, serum free and chemically defined media (CDM) have been developed as a matter of good laboratory practice. The effectiveness of serum-free media is limited, however; many cell lines still require serum in order to grow, and many serum-free media formulations are intended for narrowly-defined types of cells. Therefore, fetal serum is still widely used in cell culture.\n\nFetal bovine serum is a by-product of the dairy industry. Fetal bovine serum, as with the vast majority of animal serum used in cell culture, is produced from blood collected at commercial slaughterhouses from dairy cattle that also supply meat intended for human consumption.\n\nThe first stage of the production process for fetal bovine serum is the harvesting of blood from the bovine fetus after the fetus is removed from the slaughtered cow. The blood is collected aseptically into a sterile container or blood bag and then allowed to clot. The normal method of collection is cardiac puncture, wherein a needle is inserted into the heart. This minimizes \"the danger of serum contamination with micro-organisms from the fetus itself, and the environment\". It is then centrifuged to remove the fibrin clot and the remaining blood cells from the clear yellow (straw) colored serum. The serum is frozen prior to further processing that is necessary to make it suitable for cell culture.\n\nThe second stage of processing involves filtration, typically using a filtration chain with the final filtration being triple sterile 0.1 micrometre membrane filters. When processed by a reputable commercial serum supplier, the sterilized fetal bovine serum is subjected to stringent quality control testing and is supplied with a detailed Certificate of Analysis. The certificate gives full test results and information concerning the origin of the serum. Certificates of Analysis vary between commercial suppliers, but each usually includes the following details: filtration statement, country of origin, cell growth performance testing, microbial sterility testing, screening for mycoplasma and virus, endotoxin, haemoglobin, IgG and total protein assays.\n\nEthical questions have been raised regarding the blood collection process due to the potential suffering caused to the fetus. Although anoxia or active slaughter could be used to induce unconsciousness or death prior to serum harvesting, exposure of live unborn calves to oxygen can cause them to gain awareness before being killed, resulting in active debate about the ethics of harvesting serum.\n\nFetal bovine serum is commercially available from many manufacturers, and because cells grown in vitro are highly sensitive, customers usually test specific batches to check for suitability for their specific cell type. When changing from batch to batch it is usual to adapt the cells to the new batch of material, for example, by mixing 50% of the old serum with 50% of the new serum and allowing the cells to acclimatize to the new material.\n\nSerum is stored frozen to preserve the stability of components such as growth factors. When serum is thawed, some precipitation may be seen. This is a normal phenomenon and it does not compromise the quality of serum in any way. The precipitate may be removed by transferring the serum to sterile tubes and centrifuging for 5 minutes at 400 × \"g\".\n\nTo limit the amount of precipitation, it is recommended that the serum is thawed in a refrigerator at 2-8˚C. The serum should be regularly stirred during this process. Repeated freeze/thaw cycles should be avoided and it is advisable to dispense the serum into single use aliquots before freezing.\n\nFBS contains a complex array of protein components that are required by many cells to grow which is why it has been successfully used in cell culture. Unfortunately, large quantities of undefined proteins can lead to unwanted stimulation of cells. This is why 'serum starvation' is commonly used in experiments where subtle changes in cytokine expression need to be measured. This is where FBS can be used to maintain the cells but prior to the experiment, the serum is removed upon passage of the cells to normalize the cytokine expression. Another possible approach is to use charcoal stripped FBS which doesn't seem to be as stimulatory to cells in culture, while at the same time, supporting growth of healthy cell layers.\n\nSerum produced for use in the biotechnology industry and research sectors is highly regulated.

He was born to Dr. Seth and Eunice (Parmele) Hastings in Washington, Connecticut. He was a 3rd great-grandson of Thomas Hastings who came from the East Anglia region of England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634.\n\nHastings moved to Clinton, New York, as a youth and began his career as a singing teacher, being largely a self-taught musician. Hastings compiled the hymn book \"Spiritual Songs\" with Lowell Mason in 1831, which included his most well-known hymn \"Rock of Ages.\" He then moved to New York City, where he served as a choir master for 40 years, from 1832 to 1872. Hastings was a prolific composer, writing some 1000 hymn tunes over his career, and what Mason calls the \"simple, easy, and solemn\" style of his music remains a major influence on the hymns of the Protestant churches to this day.\n\nHastings' 1822 \"Dissertation on Musical Taste\", the first full musical treatise by an American author, was a notable voice in the shift in American music toward the models of German music rather than British; as \"one of the first spokespersons for the cultivated tradition of American music\", he emphasized the science and philosophical mission of music above the looser and more folk-based music of his predecessors. While Hastings' first compilation still showed strong evidence of adherence to the British tradition, later works would include many German songs, and what older hymns and other settings he did include had the harmonies completely rewritten to conform to German ideals of classical music.\n\nIn addition to his composition and compiling of tunebooks for use in the singing schools, Hastings founded \"Musical Magazine\", a periodical he edited from 1835 to 1837; his early writings on church music for the \"Western Recorder\", which he began editing in 1823, had given him the prior experience, as well as establishing his musical and professional credibility around its home base of Utica, New York and the surrounding areas.\n\nHastings died in New York in 1872 and is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery.\n\n\n\n"}

It had its roots among the Swedish immigrants in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1961, just before its merger into the LCA, the Augustana Synod had 1,353 pastors, 1,219 congregations, and 619,040 members.\n\nThe Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America was established in 1860. The organizing meeting was held at the Jefferson Prairie Settlement, near Clinton, Wisconsin on June 5–8. A group of Swedish Lutheran pastors including Jonas Swensson, Lars Paul Esbjörn, Tuve Hasselquist, Eric Norelius, and Erland Carlsson pioneered development of the Augustana Synod.\n\n\"Augustana\" is the Latin translation of the name of the city of Augsburg in Germany, birthplace of one of Lutheranism's defining documents, the Augsburg Confession. Along with the Swedish members of the church were Norwegian and Danish members who left the church in 1870 to form the Conference of the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and the Norwegian Augustana Synod. Also in 1870 the synod was renamed the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America. In 1894 the name was changed to Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America. In 1948, the name Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church was adopted.\n\nOriginally somewhat conservative, the church turned gradually more liberal after historical criticism had been introduced at its seminary. The Augustana Theological Seminary was located on the campus of Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois. It was later merged into the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago at the time of the formation of the Lutheran Church in America.\n\nAugustana Church was the direct parent to several liberal arts colleges in the United States: Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois; Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota; Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas; California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, California; Midland University in Fremont, Nebraska; and the defunct Upsala College in East Orange, New Jersey. Augustana and Gustavus Adolphus consistently rank among the top 100 liberal arts colleges in the U.S., and the other institutions are recognized as strong regional colleges.\n\nWhile the Augustana Church only had about 600,000 members when the Lutheran Church in America was formed, its influence on its successor bodies has been significant, incorporating many of Augustana's emphases on mission, ecumenism, and social service. Herbert W. Chilstrom, the first presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, is a graduate of the Augustana Theological Seminary and was ordained to Augustana's ministry in 1958. Included among the Augustana-founded congregations is Mount Olivet Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the largest Lutheran congregation in the world with over 13,000 members.\n\n\n\"Final statistics of the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church (December 31, 1961).\"\n\n\n"}

Perrine (1861–1943), who spearheaded the early 20th century irrigation projects in the Magic Valley region and is largely credited as the main founder of Twin Falls; a statue of Perrine is at the visitors' center at the south end of the bridge.\n\nOriginally named the \"Twin Falls-Jerome Intercounty Bridge\", a steel cantilever bridge was opened to traffic in September 1927, and formally dedicated by governor H. C. Baldridge on October 1, 1927. The privately financed $750,000 structure was originally a toll bridge; the tolls were eliminated in April 1940 after the bridge was purchased by the state of Idaho for $482,000.\n\nBy the early 1970s, the original bridge was outdated and unable to handle heavy loads and required replacement. Construction of the current bridge began in May 1973 and was completed in July 1976 at a cost of $10.56 million. The new bridge was dedicated on July 31, 1976; the original cantilever bridge to the west was later disassembled.\nLocated at the southwest end of the Perrine Bridge is the Twin Falls Visitor Center featuring souvenirs and gifts, Idaho products, visitor information, and interactive exhibits highlighting the recreational and historical activities and attractions in the region. The visitor center has views of the canyon, bridge, and access to the trail system along the canyon rim. Trails go under the bridge on either side which offers vantage points of the bridge and its structure.\n\nTo the east, along the south rim of the canyon, lies the dirt ramp used by Evel Knievel when he unsuccessfully attempted his Snake River Canyon jump on the Skycycle X-2 in September 1974; the jump failed because of a parachute malfunction. The ramp where he made the leap sits on private property about east of the bridge and is visible from the bridge as well as various vantage points along the Canyon Trail. A memorial to Knievel is located near the bridge; it was dedicated in September 1985, at a small ceremony attended by Knievel.\n\nThe Perrine Bridge is a popular BASE jumping site known all over the world; it may be the only man-made structure in the United States where BASE jumping is allowed year-round without a permit. Jumpers often use the nearby visitor center as a home base before and after parachuting from the bridge.\n\nThe first documented and video-recorded/photographed jumps from the bridge were in 1987, by three residents of Twin Falls (former U.S. Army paratroopers) who static line jumped the bridge using military surplus MC1-1B parachutes. It was done after a test drop of a 55-gallon (210 liter) drum in a T-10 parachute harness and canopy was used. Multiple successful jumps were conducted without incident or injury. In the early 1990s, bungee jumping and parachuting off the bridge gained popularity, but was still against the law; by the end of the decade, BASE jumping was legal. In July 2006, Dan Schilling jumped off the bridge 201 times in 21 hours to raise money for charity; Schilling was hoisted to the top of the bridge by a crane after every jump.\n\n\n"}

The Admiralty purchased here in 1803 to convert her to a Royal Navy bomb vessel. \"Aetna\" participated in the second Battle of Copenhagen in 1807 and the Battle of the Basque Roads in 1809. Later, she participated in the attack on Fort McHenry in the Battle of Baltimore and the bombardment of Fort Washington, Maryland in 1814, during the War of 1812. The Navy sold her in 1816 and she returned to mercantile service under her original name. She sailed to Calcutta, to Rio de Janeiro, and more locally until she was wrecked in 1823.\n\n\"Aetna\" was the merchant vessel \"Success\", launched at Arundel, equally Littlehampton, at the mouth of the River Arun. She appeared in the \"Register of Shipping\" (\"RS\") in the volume for 1804 with W.Birch, master, J. Coney, owner, and trade London. The Admiralty purchased \"Success\" in 1803. \n\n\"Aetna\" was commissioned in December 1803 under Commander George Cocks and first served in the Mediterranean. His replacement was Commander Richard Thomas.\n\nIn December 1805 she came under the command of Captain John Quillam and in February 1807 or so under Commander William Peake, still in the Mediterranean. She was recommissioned in June 1807 under Commander William Godfrey for the Baltic. There she took part in the siege and bombardment of Copenhagen between 15 August and 20 October 1807, resulting in the capture of Danish Fleet by Admiral Gambier.\n\nOn 6 April 1809, \"Aetna\", eight fire ships, and a transport with Congreve rockets, joined Captain Lord Cochrane's fleet of frigates, sloops and gunbrigs off the Chasseron lighthouse where Cochrane was preparing to attack French warships in the Basque Roads.\n\n\"Aetna\" was the only vessel of her class present. On the night of 11 April \"Aetna\", the frigate and the sloop were stationed near the north-west of the Île-d'Aix while the fire ships were launched against the enemy. At 11:00 on the 13th \"Aetna\", , the gun-brigs and the rocket cutters moved up to the mouth of the Charante to fire on the French ships , and \"Indienne\" which had been driven ashore. \"Aetna\" split her 13-inch mortar in the attack. At 16:00 the falling tide forced them to return to their former anchorage under fire from shore batteries. By the evening of the 14th she had fired away all her 10-inch shells, but she did not leave the mouth of the Charente until the 29th. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the then still surviving participants in the battle the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with the clasp \"Basque Roads 1809\".\n\n\"Aetna\" then formed part of the naval force in the Scheldt under the command of Sir Richard Strachan. At 06:00 on the morning of 28 July 1809 \"Aetna\", together with the whole fleet in The Downs, set sail for Flushing and that evening they anchored about 18 miles from Walcheren. On the 30th they watched the troops go ashore covered by the frigates.\n\nThe following morning at 11:00 \"Aetna\", with the rest of the force, opened fire with her two mortars for the first time and fired 42 shells before an officer in a boat came round the various ships about midnight to desire them to desist. Commander Paul Lawless assumed command of \"Aetna\" in August, though he may have already been in command before then.\n\nOn 2 August \"Aetna\" moved towards the fort at Rammekens and on the 5th she anchored about a mile and a half from Flushing. \"Aetna\" saw no more action until the 13th when she fired seventy-four 13-inch shells and thirty-nine 10-inch at Flushing before the tide turned. When they were able to close again another fifty-two 12-inch and nine 10-inch shells were discharged. HMS \"Vesuvius\", several gunbrigs and man-of-war launches with 24-pounders were firing alongside them. There was more firing on the 14th and 15th before a white flag was seen and the town surrendered on the 17th. By the 18th \"Aetna\" was a little more than 12 miles from Antwerp and a number of officers went ashore for a walk on South Beveland. On the 22nd they dropped down to the town of Doel and fired thirty-five 13-inch and five 10-inch shells to deter the French from throwing up a battery. , , and \"Aetna\" threw one shell per hour through the night, but in the morning they found that the enemy had continued work so, until the 26th they fired another 133 shells at the battery. All this time Antwerp was only seven or eight miles away, but still the troops waited, suffering from miasmatic fever and dysentery. On the 29th \"Aetna\" fired fifteen large shells against the battery and \"Thunder\", \"Hound\" and a brig threw their shells into the enemy troops on the opposite side of the Scheldt. The following day forty-one more shells were fired. During the first week in September South Beveland was evacuated and the fiasco of the Walcheren expedition drew to a close.\n\nCockburn in his dispatches after the campaign noted that \"the constant and correct Fire from the Ætna, Captain Lawless, particularly drew my Attention.\" Commander John Bowker replaced Lawless and then sailed \"Aetna\" for Cadiz on 8 April 1810.\n\n\"Aetna\" was subsequently employed in the defence of Cadiz. On 23 November \"Aetna\", and \"Thunder\", with a division of Spanish, and two divisions of British gun-boats, bombarded Fort Catalina at the southern end of the Bay of Bulls, while mortar and howitzer boats threw about 100 shells into French gunboats in the Guadalete river by El Puerto de Santa María.\n\nOn 24 November the mortar and howitzer boats threw several hundred shells into Santa Maria whilst \"Aetna\", \"Devastation\" and \"Thunder\", with part of the Spanish flotilla and the British gunboats drew the fire from Catalina. At the beginning of December \"Aetna\" burst her large mortar, the fourth time she had done so during the siege.\n\nIn November 1811 Commander Richard Kenah replaced Bowker. He sailed \"Aetna\" to the Baltic in 1813.\n\"Aetna\" then sailed for North America.\n\nIn April 1814 \"Aetna\" sailed to America to join the squadron of Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. On 17 August the frigate , bombs \"Devastation\", \"Aetna\", and \"Meteor\", the rocket ship , and the dispatch boat \"Anna-Maria\" were detached under Captain Gordon of to sail up the Potomac River and bombard Fort Washington, about ten or twelve miles below the capital. Contrary winds meant they had to sweep for more than 50 miles over a period of five successive days, and lacking a pilot through Kettle-Bottoms, meant that it took ten days to reach the Fort.\n\nOn the evening of the 27th they began a bombardment of the fort which continued until the powder magazine exploded. When the British took possession the following morning they found that the Americans had retreated leaving 21 heavy guns and 6 field-pieces - all spiked. On the 29th they accepted the surrender of the town of Alexandria and took possession of 21 seaworthy vessels which were loaded with merchandise and naval and ordnance stores. On 31 August arrived with news that the Americans were mounting guns downstream to oppose the squadron's return, so the British started back without delay. Unfortunately \"Devastation\" ran aground, and the Americans tried to destroy her with three fire ships. The British, who launched their own boats, drove off the Americans and towed the fire-vessels to shore. The squadron spent a total of 23 days in the river. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the then still surviving participants in the battle the NGSM with the clasp \"The Potomac 17 Augt. 1814\".\n\nOn 12 September 1814 \"Erebus\", \"Meteor\", \"Aetna\", , , and \"Devastation\" sailed up the Patapsco River in preparation for an attack on Baltimore, commencing their bombardment of Fort McHenry on the 13th, before being ordered to withdraw on the 14th.\n\nOn 19 September 1814 the fleet, including , , , and \"Aetna\", remained at anchor in the Patuxent River until 27th when it moved to the Potomac where shore operations were recommenced on 3 October, on which day Commander Kenah was killed. On 14 October the fleet departed for Negril Bay, Jamaica, arriving on 5 November, to prepare for the attack on New Orleans. Commander Francis Fead commanded \"Aetna\" in 1815.\n\n\"Aetna\" and \"Meteor\" were dispatched up the Mississippi, along with , , and , to create a diversion by bombarding Fort St Philip. For most of January 1815, \"Aetna\" was moored off the Mississippi, and moved to a new anchorage off Ship Island on 27 January 1815. On 9 February, \"Aetna\" was off Mobile Sound, and was ordered to send Lieutenant Knight and his Marine artillerymen to join the army on shore, who were preparing to besiege Fort Bowyer. The following day, the bomb vessels \"Meteor\", and \"Hydra\" arrived. The ship was to witness the capitulation of the fort and the raising of the Union Jack.\n\n\"Aetna\" was to remain off Mobile until the end of March 1815. On 25 April 1815, she embarked some refugee slaves for passage to the Caribbean. They had come from the Negro Fort, which the British were evacuating. Once the former slaves had disembarked, \"Aetna\" embarked invalided servicemen whom she carried to Portsmouth.\n\nReturning from America, \"Aetna\" arrived back at Portsmouth on 19 July 1815, before sailing to Woolwich for disposal. The principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered the \"Ætna bomb, of 368 tons\", lying at Woolwich, for sale on 14 December. She sold there on 11 January 1816 for £1,850.\n\n\"Success\" reappeared in \"Lloyd's Register\" in 1816 with Martin, master, Morgan & Co., owner, and trade London–Jamaica. She had undergone a thorough repair in 1816.\n\nOn 26 November 1817 \"Success\" was at Deal, having arrived from the Thames on her way to Calcutta. On 28 February 1818 \"Success\" arrived off the Cape of Good Hope from London; she was bound for Calcutta. She arrived back at Gravesend on 254 January 1819.\n\nOn 30 December 1818 as \"Success\" was returning from Bengal she was off Pico Island in the Azores when the insurgent privateer schooner \"Buenos Ayres\", of 18 guns and 100 men (mostly Britons and Americans), boarded \"Success\". In the dusk they suspected that she was Spanish because of her high stern. The privateer's me;n inspected her papers carefully to insure that she was not Spanish sailing under a false flag. The privateer's Chief Mate informed Captain Martin that the privateer had been out nine months and had a successful cruise, having captured numerous vessels, including a major Spanish vessel and a Portuguese vessel coming from Bengal with Spanish goods on board.\n\n\"Lloyd's List\" published a letter from Les Sables-d'Olonne dated 16 August reporting that \"Success\", Martin, had wrecked while sailing between Oberon (Oléron) to Abbeveille. The crew had been saved.\n\n\n"}

During the Napoleonic Wars she served as a convoy escort on the Leeward Islands station. Then in 1810 the Admiralty had her converted into a bomb vessel and renamed her HMS \"Volcano. As \"Volcano\" she served during the War of 1812, and in particular participated in the Battle of Baltimore. The Admiralty sold her in 1816. New owners returned her to mercantile service under her original name of \"Jason\". She was wrecked in 1821.\n\n\"Jason\" appeared in the \"Register of Shipping\" (\"RS\") for 1804 with Otway, master, W. Row, owner, and voyage Newcastle to Liverpool.\n\nThe Admiralty purchased \"Jason\" in 1804. After the Treaty of Amiens, Britain had disarmed while France rearmed, so on the resumption of war the Admiralty found itself short of vessels for convoy escort. Because of the urgency of the situation, the Admiralty purchased twenty three-masted mercantile vessels; one was \"Jason\". \"Jason\" came into service with her original masts and yards even though she was under-canvassed and therefore slow, and without a cargo in her hold tended to roll; she became HMS \"Heron\".\n\nShe was commissioned in June 1804 under Commander John Edgecombe. At the end of the year he escorted a convoy of merchantmen from England to Barbados. Once in Barbados Edgecombe faced a dilemma. On the one hand there were reports of an enemy fleet in the Windward Isles that could threaten Barbados. On the other hand, a fleet of 28 merchantmen and two transports had gathered in Carlisle Bay, awaiting a warship to escort them to Halifax or Britain. Edgecombe decided to escort the convoy, risking court martial for leaving his duty station without orders. Five of the ships parted company for Halifax. , off Cape Clear, met six others that were going up the St. Georges Channel. \"Heron\" accompanied the remainder to the Downs, where the convoy arrived on 2 August 1805. The captains of the 19 vessels that Edgecombe had convoyed signed a letter, interceding with the Admiralty on his behalf. The letter proved moot as the Admiralty had already approved Edgecombe's actions.\n\nEdgecombe realized that \"Heron\" was too slow to catch enemy cruisers; instead he decided to use guile. While she was sailing to Antigua with a convoy he noticed a schooner approaching. He hoisted American colours and dressed a midshipman as a woman. \nThe schooner showed French colours and approached. Unfortunately, the French vessel was too low for \"Heron\"s guns to bear and rolled too much for her crew to secure grapnels. All that the British could do was raise the British ensign and discharge a volley of musketry before the French vessel escaped. later captured the schooner, which turned out to be \"Matilde\", of 16 guns. \n\nThereafter, \"Heron\" escorted convoys to Halifax, Newfoundland and Bermuda until December 1806 when Edgecombe, whose health had been impaired, left. \"Heron\" then remained in ordinary until 1810 when the Admiralty had her converted into a bomb vessel and renamed her \"Volcano\".\n\nCommander David Price assumed command of \"Volcano\" on 6 December 1813. In the summer of 1814 he sailed her to North America to join Sir Alexander Cochrane's fleet off the entrance to Baltimore harbour where he joined in the bombardment of Fort McHenry. Along with her were other bomb vessels and a Congreve rocket vessel, . The entire fleet consisted of 19 vessels, and launched over 1,500 bombs during the attack, but succeeded in killing only four Americans and wounding 24 before giving up the attack.\n\nLater, \"Volcano\" served in the Potomac under Rear Admiral Pulteney Malcolm. On 31 October 1814, while escorting a merchantman to Jamaica, \"Volcano\" nearly succeeded in capturing the 7-gun American privateer schooner \"Saucy Jack\". The two vessels exchange fire before the American took advantage of her greater speed and escaped. The British lost three men killed; the Americans lost seven killed and 14 wounded.\n\n\"Volcano\" was sent up the Mississippi, with another bomb vessel, , and (18), (12), and (10) to bombard Fort St Philip. After the British retired from New Orleans, \"Volcano\" sailed along the Gulf Coast and was present during the siege of Fort Bowyer in February 1815.\n\nAfter end of the war with America, \"Volcano\" sailed for home on 5 April 1815 and arrived at Portsmouth on 31 May. Commander John Watling assumed command in June, but the Navy paid \"Volcano\" off in September.\n\nDisposal: The Admiralty sold \"Volcano\" on 28 August 1816 for £1,100.\n\nNew owners returned \"Volcano\" to mercantile service under her original name.

Book I deals with Quintus' apology of divination (in line with his essentially Stoic beliefs), while Book II contains Cicero's refutation of these from his Academic skeptic philosophical standpoint. Cicero concerns himself in some detail with the types of divination, dividing them into the \"inspired\" type (Latin \"furor\", Gk. \"mania\", \"madness\"), especially dreams, and the type which occurs via some form of skill of interpretation (i.e., haruspicy, extispicy, augury, astrology, and other oracles).\n\n\"De Divinatione\" may be considered as a supplement to Cicero's \"De Natura Deorum\". In \"De Divinatione\", Cicero professes to relate the substance of a conversation held at Tusculum with his brother, in which Quintus, following the principles of the Stoics, supported the credibility of divination, while Cicero himself controverted it. The dialogue consists of two books, in the first Quintus enumerates the different kinds or classes of divination, with reasons in their favour. The second book contains a refutation by Cicero of his brother's arguments.\n\nIn the first book Quintus, after observing that divinations of various kinds have been common among all people, remarks that it is no argument against different forms of divination that we cannot explain how or why certain things happen. It is sufficient, that we know from experience and history that they do happen. He argues that although events may not always succeed as predicted, it does not follow that divination is not an art, any more than that medicine is not an art, because it does not always cure. Quintus offers various accounts of the different kinds of omens, dreams, portents, and divinations. He includes two remarkable dreams, one of which had occurred to Cicero and one to himself. He also asks if Greek history with its various accounts of omens should be also considered a fable.\n\nIn the second book Cicero provides arguments against auguries, auspices, astrology, lots, dreams, and every species of omens and prodigies. It concludes with a chapter on the evils of superstition, and Cicero's efforts to extirpate it. The whole thread is interwoven by curious and interesting stories.\n\n\"De Divinatione\" is notable as one of posterity's primary sources on the workings of Roman religion, and as a source for the conception of scientificity in Roman classical antiquity.\n\n\n\n"}

A properly made snow cave can be 0 °C (32 °F) or warmer inside, even when outside temperatures are −40 °C (−40 °F).\n\nA snow cave is constructed by excavating snow so that the tunnel entrance is below the main space to retain warm air. Construction is simplified by building it on a steep slope and digging slightly upwards and horizontally into the slope. The roof is domed to prevent dripping on the occupants. Adequate snow depth, free of rocks and ice, is needed—generally a depth of is sufficient. Another kind of snow cave is the quinzhee, which is constructed of snow rather than created by digging a hole out of (or displacing) snow.\n\nRegardless of construction type, the snow must be consolidated so that it retains its structure. The walls and roof should be at least thick. A small pit may be dug deeper into one part of the cave floor to provide a place for the coldest air to gather, away from the occupants, and the entrance may be partially blocked with chunks of snow to deflect wind and retain heat, although it is vital to prevent drifting snow from completely plugging the rest of the entrance in order to maintain a constant air supply. Some prefer to place a ski pole or a ski up from the cave out through the roof or side wall. This can provide an emergency air hole should the main entrance become blocked.\n\nIt is possible to sleep several consecutive nights in a snow cave, but care must be taken since a slight ice surface may develop on the inside of the cave from moisture in the exhaled air of the inhabitants. This is thought to result in reduced air ventilation through the snow cave walls and roof, and thus increase risk of suffocation. As a precaution it is common to scrape off a thin layer from the inside of the cave ceiling each day spent in the cave.\n\nA narrow entrance tunnel, a little wider than the occupants of the cave, leads into the main chamber which consists of a flat area, perhaps with elevated sleeping platforms, also excavated from snow. Most sources agree that using tools such as a shovel and ice axe are vital; digging by hand is for emergencies only. Digging a snow cave can be very physically demanding. In perfect conditions with good snow, digging a snow cave for 2 or 3 persons often takes 3 to 4 hours to complete. It can be useful to take turns in a group of climbers such that each person works in 5 minute intervals inside the cave, while the others help remove excess snow outside the cave and prepare food and warm liquids for the group.\n\n\n"}

He also has a successful career as a solo artist.\n\nBebek was born in Sarajevo, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia to Bosnian Croat parents Zvonimir and Katarina. He showed an early interest in music, entertaining his mother's house guests by singing songs he heard on the radio. He also experimented with harmonica, but abandoned it in third grade of primary school as he wanted to play guitar and sing along. His teacher, however, discouraged such intentions so Željko ended up playing mandolin instead. He soon became the school's best mandolin player and was allowed to play guitar as a reward.\n\nAt age sixteen, Bebek began taking the stage at Eho 61, an open mic club-like school activity for the musically inclined students of Sarajevo's Second Gymnasium. A couple of years earlier, the same stage saw a performance by teenage Kornelije Kovač who would later also go on to become a famous musician and composer.\n\nBebek's next musical activity came in a nameless band with Šento Borovčanin and the Redžić brothers – Fadil and Zoran. Bebek carried on playing with the band until Fadil Redžić left to join Indexi.\n\nIn 1965, Eduard Edo Bogeljić invited 20-year-old Bebek to join a cover band he founded called Kodeksi that also featured Ismeta Dervoz on backing vocals and Luciano Paganotto on drums.\n\nBebek spent the next couple of years singing and playing rhythm guitar with the band, helping them become quite prominent locally in the city. As Kodeksi experienced persistent problems filling the bass guitar spot, Bebek recommended 18-year-old Goran Bregović after seeing the youngster play with Beštije in 1969. It would be the beginning of Bebek's long professional association with Bregović that would often turn tumultuous.\n\nIn fall 1970, after falling out with band mates during the band's stay in Italy, Bebek left Kodeksi and returned home to Sarajevo.\n\nShortly after getting back to Sarajevo, Bebek established Novi Kodeksi with another former Kodeksi member Edo Bogeljić. Conceptualized as a return to the original Kodeksi cover repertoire, Bogeljić's and Bebek's band gigged around Sarajevo with diminishing success as the audiences' general taste seemingly moved away from cover music; although at one point they broke a record for the length of performance, spending 32 straight hours playing on stage.\n\nThe new year 1971 brought more creative stagnation as their repertoire still consisted entirely of foreign covers. In December 1971, Bebek received a notice from the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) to report for his mandatory military service and Novi Kodeksi played their last ever gig at Sarajevo's Dom Mladih. Twenty-six years of age at this point, Bebek got married with the intention of settling down and giving up on trying to make a living via playing music altogether.\n\nJust as he was about to report for the obligatory army duty in early 1972, 26-year-old Bebek received an invitation from Bregović — whom, at that point, he hadn't spoken to in a year-and-a-half ever since their split in Italy – to record \"Patim, evo, deset dana\" song with Jutro, a new band Bregović formed with Nuno Arnautalić. Bebek accepted, recorded vocals in a studio, and then left for his army stint in Pirot in late February 1972.\n\nDischarged from the army in March 1973 and returning home, Bebek joined Jutro in earnest, but also took a clerk job as a protective measure due to not being certain about the band's creative and commercial potential. Jutro did become successful and he quit the government job to again devote to music full-time. Jutro soon transformed into Bijelo dugme, with Bebek as a founding member.\n\nBebek continued as vocalist and occasional bassist in Bijelo dugme from its inception in 1974. Bebek found himself to be a country-wide celebrity. He ended up spending a full decade and recording six studio albums with the band before eventually leaving in April 1984 to fully pursue a solo career.\n\nBebek maintains a solo career, which began during the late 1970s in parallel with his work in Bijelo Dugme.\n\nIn 1978, while Bregović was away serving the army stint and Dugme was on hiatus, Bebek recorded a solo album, \"Skoro da smo isti\", with drummer Điđi Jankelić and old friend Edo Bogeljić on guitar and keyboards. The album was released on 28 July 1978, but failed both critically and commercially, selling only 6,000 copies and quickly falling into oblivion. Though Bebek and his collaborators had planned a tour in support of the album, their plans got scrapped following the poor public reaction.\n\nIn late 1983, shortly before officially leaving Bijelo Dugme, Bebek returned to his solo career by recording his second solo album \"Mene tjera neki vrag\". The album was released in 1984, with the title track becoming a moderate radio hit in Yugoslavia.\n\nThroughout his 11-album solo run, Bebek had several major hits, most of them occurring in the 1984–1989 period. Most of his hits had a strong commercial folk influence, including \"Oprosti mi što te volim\", \"Da je sreće bilo\", \"Laku noć svirači\", \"Jabuke i vino\" (duet with Zana Nimani), \"Sinoć sam pola kafane popio\" (with lyrics by Bora Đorđević), \"Da zna zora\" (duet with Halid Bešlić)\", \"Čaša otrova\", \"Gdje će ti duša\", and others. Also he had several hit ballads like \"Žuta Ruža\", \"I Bog je od nas digao ruke\", \"Šta je meni ovo trebalo\", \"Lagano umirem\", \"Tko je mene prokleo\", and \"Ne idi sad\".\n\nWhen the Yugoslav wars started, he moved to Zagreb where he continues to live and work. His record labels included Taped Pictures and Croatia Records.\n\nIn 2005 he took part in three large reunion concerts of Bijelo dugme, in Zagreb, Sarajevo and Belgrade, performing alongside most of the musicians that passed through the band, including the other two vocalists (Alen Islamović and Tifa).\n\nDuring 2006, Bebek (in collaboration with Alen Islamović and Tifa) formed a Bijelo dugme tribute band called \"B.A.T.\" (stands for Bebek, Alen, Tifa), which performed on numerous stages around the world between 2006 and 2010. Their 2006 \"Kad Bi' Bio Bijelo Dugme\" North American tour (together with Okus Meda and Tifa Band), was featured in a documentary titled \"B.A.T.: Balkan Rock Nostalgia\", (directed by Serb-American filmmaker B. R. Tatalovic). Bebek was one of the three featured performers alongside Alen Islamovic, and Tifa, in a documentary that followed the musicians while they were on tour.\n\nDuring 2012, after recording a duet with Crvena Jabuka, Bebek met their producer, Branimir Mihaljević, and together they started working on what will become Bebek's new studio album, first after twelve years. Album entitled \"Kad poljubac pomiješaš sa vinom\" was released in late 2012. Some of the songs on the album include \"Gdje sam bio\", \"Kaldrma\", \"Tango\" (duet with Severina Vučković), \"Začarani krug\" and others.\n\nBebek was born in Sarajevo in the former SFR Yugoslavia to Bosnian Croat parents Zvonimir, his father and Katarina, his mother. He has been married three times. He has a daughter Silvija from his first marriage, and another daughter Bianca from his second marriage.\n\nFrom his current, third, marriage with Ružica from Tomislavgrad whom he met in 1997 and soon married, Bebek has a son Zvonimir and daughter Katarina, named after his father and mother.\n\n\n"}

The Navy purchased her in 1804. She served in the English Channel, the Baltic, off the coast of Spain, and in the United States during the Napoleonic Wars and War of 1812, most notably at the bombardment of Fort McHenry in the Battle of Baltimore in September 1814. The Navy sold her in 1816.\n\nSimon Temple Jnr, of South Shields, launched \"Intrepid\" in 1803. Although one highly reputable source gives her launch year as 1789, \"Intrepid\" did not appear in \"Lloyd's Register\" between 1790 and 1805. She did enter the \"Register of Shipping\" (\"RS\") in 1804 with Longridge, master, S.Temple, owner, launch location Jarrow, launch year of 1803, and trade Newcastle–London. The Royal Navy purchased \"Intrepid\" in 1804.\n\nCommander Alexander Milner commissioned \"Devastation\" in March 1804 for the North Sea.\n\nAs part of Britain's measures against Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom \"Devastation\" was part of a large squadron, comprising eleven ships, ten brigs, three bomb-vessels, an armed lugger, and a cutter, which on 24 and 25 April 1805, captured eight unarmed schuyts and an unarmed transport ship at Boulogne.\n\nBetween 1806 and 1807 \"Devastation\" was under the command of Commander Matthew Smith. Commander J.Smith recommissioned her in March 1808.\n\nIn 1808 \"Devastation\" was in the squadron under the command of Rear-Admiral Richard Keats operating in the Baltic Sea during the war with Denmark–Norway. When news of the uprising of the Spanish against the French reached Denmark, some 12,000 Spanish troops of the Division of the North stationed there under the command of the Marquis de la Romana decided that they wished to leave French service and return to Spain. The Marquis contacted Rear-Admiral Keats in his flagship , and on 9 August 1808 the Spaniards seized the fort and town of Nyborg. Keats' squadron then took possession of the port and organized the transportation of the Spanish back to their home country.\n\n\"Devastation\", Commander John Taylor, took part in the Walcheren Campaign in July and August 1809. He sailed for Cadiz on 8 April 1810.\n\nAt the end of 1810 Cadiz was being besieged by the French, who had assembled a flotilla of gun-boats to attack the town. On 23 November \"Devastation\", , and , with a number of English and Spanish mortar and gun-boats, attacked the French flotilla at El Puerto de Santa María, between them firing some hundred shells with considerable effect.\n\nIn February 1812 Commander Thomas Alexander assumed command of \"Devastation\".\n\nShortly after the outbreak of the War of 1812, on 12 August, \"Devastation\" shared in the seizure of several American vessels: \"Cuba\", \"Caliban\", \"Edward\", \"Galen\", \"Halcyon\", and \"Cygnet\".\n\nIn 1813 \"Devastation\" served in the Baltic.\nDuring the War of 1812 \"Devastation\", commanded by Thomas Alexander, was part of the squadron under the command of James Gordon that in August–September 1814 sailed up the Potomac River in the raid on Alexandria, seeing the destruction of Fort Warburton, and accepting the surrender of the town. There they captured twenty-two merchant vessels and vast quantities of plunder, including 16,000 barrels of flour, 1,000 hogsheads of tobacco, 150 bales of cotton and some $5,000 worth of wine, sugar and other items before withdrawing. In the subsequent Battle of Baltimore, \"Devastation\" was one of five bomb-vessels that shelled Fort McHenry for 25 hours on 13–14 September, though without result.\n\nOn the morning of 31 October 1814, \"Devastation\" arrived at Parker's Point, Virginia, on the Potomac River, and landed two hundred seamen and marines to procure cattle. An American force of about 114 cavalry and 1,000 infantry, with five field guns, attacked the British. \"Devastation\"s men repulsed the attack, capturing two prisoners and twenty horses, and afterwards re-embarked without loss.\n\nEarly the next year \"Devastation\" was operating off Cumberland Island, Georgia. On 14 January 1815, after the capture of Fort Peter, British troops accompanied by the \"Devastation\" and ascended the river to St. Marys and occupied the town.\n\nIn March 1815 Commander Martin Guise assumed command of \"Devastation\".\n\nOn 11 May 1816 \"Devastation\" was one of a large number of war-surplus ships and vessels advertised for sale at Portsmouth. She sold on 30 May for £1,400.\n\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n"}

Bermudian Springs School District encompasses approximately . The district includes: the Boroughs of East Berlin and York Springs, as well as, the village of Idaville, Huntington Township, Latimore Township, Reading Township and a small part of Hamilton Township. The 1990 U.S. census totals showed these communities have over 11,500 inhabitants. According to 2007 local census data, it served a resident population of 13,077. By 2010, the district's population had risen to 13,115 people. The educational attainment levels for the Bermudian Springs School District population (25 years old and over) were 83.9% high school graduates and 16.2% college graduates.\n\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, 32.4% of the district's pupils lived at 185% or below the Federal Poverty level as shown by their eligibility for the federal free or reduced price school meal programs in 2012. In 2009, Bermudian Springs School District residents' per capita income was $16,811 a year, while the median family income was $40,063. In the Commonwealth, the median family income was $49,501 and the United States median family income was $49,445, in 2010. In Adams County, the median household income was $56,529. By 2013, the median household income in the United States rose to $52,100.\n\nAccording to district officials, in school year 2007–2008, the Bermudian Springs School District provided basic educational services to 2,132 pupils through the employment of 137 teachers, 106 full-time and part-time support personnel, and 10 administrators. The Bermudian Springs School District received more than $9.3 million in state funding in school year 2007–2008. The district provided basic educational services to 2,044 pupils in 2011-2012. It employed: 142 teachers, 79 full-time and part-time support personnel, and fifteen (15) administrators during the 2011-2012 school year. The district received $9.9 million in state funding in the 2011-2012 school year.\n\nBermudian Springs School District is located along Pennsylvania Route 94 (Carlisle Pike) outside of York Springs. The district operates: Bermudian Springs High School, Bermudian Springs Middle School and Bermudian Springs Elementary School. Prior to the construction of the current elementary school, the district oversaw elementary schools in the Boroughs of East Berlin and York Springs. Bermudian Springs High School underwent a major renovation project that was completed in March 2008.\n\nBermudian Springs School District operates three schools: Bermudian Springs Elementary School, Bermudian Springs Middle School and Bermudian Springs High School. Bermudian Springs School District is served by the Lincoln Intermediate Unit 12 which offers a variety of services, including curriculum development assistance, shared services, a group purchasing program and a wide variety of special education and special needs services.\n\nBermudian Springs School District is governed by 9 individually elected board members (serve four-year terms) with over 743 employees, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania General Assembly. The federal government controls programs it funds like Title I funding for low-income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act (renamed Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in December 2015) which mandates the district focus its resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills. The school board is required by state law to post a financial report on the district in its website by March of each school year.\n\nAs defined in section 004 of the Board Policy, the members of the school board are chosen from three regions within the district, which much have similar population sizes.. Each region is currently defined, as of the 2019 municipal election, as follows:\n\nThe Superintendent and Business Manager are appointed by the school board. The Superintendent is the chief administrative officer with overall responsibility for all aspects of operations, including education and finance. The Business Manager is responsible for budget and financial operations. Neither of these officials are voting members of the School Board. The School Board enters into individual employment contracts for these positions. These contracts must be in writing and are subject to public disclosure under the state's Right to Know Act. In Pennsylvania, public school districts are required to give 150 days notice to the Superintendent and Business Manager regarding renewal of their employment contracts. Pursuant to Act 141 of 2012 which amended the Pennsylvania School Code, all school districts that have hired superintendents on/after the fall of 2012 are required to develop objective performance standards and post them on the district's website.\n\nThe Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives Sunshine Review gave the school board and district administration a \"F\" for transparency based on a review of \"What information can people find on their school district's website\". It examined the school district's website for information regarding; taxes, the current budget, meetings, school board members names and terms, contracts, audits, public records information and more.\n\nIn 2016, Bermudian Springs School District ranked 252th out of 494 Pennsylvania public school districts, by the Pittsburgh Business Times. The ranking is based on the last 3 years of student academic achievement as demonstrated by PSSAs results in: reading, writing, math and science and the three Keystone Exams (literature, Algebra 1, Biology I) in high school. Three school districts were excluded because they do not operate high schools (Saint Clair Area School District, Midland Borough School District, Duquesne City School District). The PSSAs are given to all children in grades 3rd through 8th. Adapted PSSA examinations are given to children in the special education programs. Writing exams were given to children in 5th and 8th grades.\n\n\nIn 2013, the \"Pittsburgh Business Times\" also reported an Overachievers Ranking for 498 Pennsylvania school districts. Bermudian Springs School District ranked 481st. The editor describes the ranking as: \"a ranking answers the question - which school districts do better than expectations based upon economics? This rank takes the Honor Roll rank and adds the percentage of students in the district eligible for free and reduced-price lunch into the formula. A district finishing high on this rank is smashing expectations, and any district above the median point is exceeding expectations.\"\n\n\nIn 2012, Bermudian Springs School District declined to Warning Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) status, under the federal No Child Left Behind Act. In 2004 through 2011, Bermudian Springs School District achieved AYP status. In 2003, Bermudian Springs School District was in Warning AYP status, due to lagging student achievement in reading. In 2011, 94 percent of the 500 Pennsylvania Public School Districts achieved the No Child Left Behind Act progress level of 72% of students reading on grade level and 67% of students demonstrating on grade level math. In 2011, 46.9 percent of Pennsylvania school districts achieved Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) based on student performance. An additional 37.8 percent of school districts made AYP based on a calculated method called safe harbor, 8.2 percent on the growth model and 0.8 percent on a two-year average performance.\n\nIn 2016, Bermudian Springs School District's graduation rate was 94.55%.\n\nAccording to traditional graduation rate calculations:\n\nBermudian Springs High School is located at 7335 Carlisle Pike, York Springs. In 2016, enrollment was reported as 647 pupils in 9th through 12th grades, with 37.8% of pupils eligible for a free lunch due to the family meeting the federal poverty level. Additionally, 7.7% of pupils received special education services, while 5.8% of pupils were identified as gifted. The school employed 41 teachers. Per the PA Department of Education, 2% of the teachers were rated \"Non‐Highly Qualified\" under the federal No Child Left Behind Act.\n\nIn 2013, Bermudian Springs High School's enrollment was 642 pupils with 21% coming from a low income home. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2010, the school reported an enrollment of 624 pupils in grades 9th through 12th, with 104 pupils eligible for a federal free or reduced-price lunch. The school employed 44 teachers, yielding a student–teacher ratio of 14:1. According to a report by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 6 teachers were rated \"Non‐Highly Qualified\" under No Child Left Behind.\n\nSPP 76.6 out of 100 points.\nBermudian Springs High School Keystone Exams mandated testing results were: 80% of students were on grade level in reading.literature and 67% of students demonstrated on grade level in Algebra I. In Biology I, 61% of pupils demonstrated on grade level science understanding at the end of the Biology course. The requirement that pupils pass the Keystone Exams in reading, algebra I and bIology I in order to graduate was postponed until 2019 by the Pennsylvania General Assembly because less than 60% of 12 grade pupils statewide would have been eligible for graduation from high school due to failing one or more Keystone Exams. Fifty-four percent of the 2,676 public schools in Pennsylvania achieved a passing score of 70 or better.\n\nBermudian Springs High School achieved 77.1 out of 100. Reflects on grade level reading, mathematics and science achievement. The PDE reported that 77% of the high school's students were on grade level in reading/literature. In Algebra 1, 73% of students showed on grade level skills at the end of the course. In Biology I, 55.8% demonstrated on grade level science understanding at the end of the course. Statewide, 53 percent of schools with an eleventh grade achieved an academic score of 70 or better. Five percent of the 2,033 schools with 11th grade were scored at 90 and above; 20 percent were scored between 80 and 89; 28 percent between 70 and 79; 25 percent between 60 and 69 and 22 percent below 60. The Keystone Exam results showed: 73 percent of students statewide scored at grade-level in English, 64 percent in Algebra I and 59 percent in biology.\n\nBermudian Springs High School achieved 77.1 out of 100. Reflects on grade level reading, mathematics and science achievement. In reading/literature – 85% were on grade level. In Algebra 1, 72.7% showed on grade level skills. In Biology, 65% showed on grade level science understanding. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2,134 of 2,947 Pennsylvania public schools (72 percent of Pennsylvania public schools), achieved an academic score of 70 or higher. Fifty-three percent of schools statewide received lower SPP scores compared with last year's, while 46 percent improved. A handful were unchanged.\n\nBermudian Springs High School achieved 84.2 out of 100. Reflects on grade level reading, mathematics and science achievement. In reading/literature – 83% were on grade level. In Algebra 1, 70% showed on grade level skills. In Biology, 45.7% showed on grade level science understanding. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2,181 public schools (less than 73 percent of Pennsylvania public schools), achieved an academic score of 70 or higher. Pennsylvania 11th grade students no longer take the PSSAs. Instead, they now take the Keystone Exams at the end of the associated course.\n\nIn 2012, Bermudian Springs High School declined to School Improvement I Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) status due to missing all academic metrics measured. In 2011, Bermudian Springs High School declined in Warning AYP status due to declining student achievement in mathematics and the low reading achievement. In 2010, Bermudian Springs High School achieved AYP status.\n\nPennsylvania System of School Assessments, commonly called PSSAs are No Child Left Behind Act related examinations which were administered from 2003 through 2012, in all Pennsylvania public high schools. The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.\n\nIn 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the applicable course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year. The state announced the change in 2010 and made it in order to comply with Governor Edward G. Rendell's agreement to change to the national Common Core standards.\n\n\n\n\nScience in Motion Bermudian Springs High School did not take advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate. Gettysburg College provided the science enrichment experiences to schools in the region.\n\nAccording to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 32% of Bermudian Springs High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.\n\nDual enrollment – The Bermudian Springs High School does not offer the Pennsylvania dual enrollment program which permits students to earn deeply discounted college credits with the assistance of a state grant. Over 400 school districts in Pennsylvania offer their high school juniors and seniors the dual enrollment program.\n\nIn 2013, Bermudian Springs High School offered 2 Advanced Placement (AP) courses at a higher cost than regular courses. Students have the option of taking College Board approved courses and then taking the College Board's examination in the Spring. Students, who achieve a 3 or better on the exam, may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most higher education give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some schools also give credits for scores of 3. High schools give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class.

He claimed that districts which offered these programs would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. Bermudian Springs School District has seen an increase in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings.\n\nBermudian Springs School District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Special Education Supervisor.\n\nStudents who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) may take the PSSA-M an alternative math exam rather than the PSSA. Some special education students may take the PASA (Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment), rather than the PSSA. Schools are permitted to provide accommodations to some students.\n\nIn 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.\n\nBermudian Springs School District received a $1,048,624 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2013-2014, 2012–2013 and 2011–2012 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010–11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. In 2014-2015, Bermudian Springs School District received $1,063,914 for special education costs. Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding.\n\nIn 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission provided a report on the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. Funding for special education programs is borne largely on a local basis at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion or 30% and the federal government providing 10% of the funding.\n\nLRE monitoring In 2009, Bermudian Springs School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. One hundred ninety six schools districts were selected in 2008-2009. The district received an alert letter from the PDE – Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. Bermudian Springs School District was placed in Tier 3 due to students spending more than 60% of the school day, outside of regular education. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers. In 2010, the district was assigned to the Tier 3 monitoring list, due to students spending less than 40% of their day in a regular education classroom. The district received a letter of \"Warning\" letter from the Pennsylvania Department of Education.\n\nBermudian Springs School District Administration reported that 51 of its students or 2.46% were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.\n\nThe Bermudian Springs School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the district in 2015. Additionally, there were 3 incidents of intimidation and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in three incidents at the schools with no arrests.\n\nIn December 2013, the Administration suspended a teacher and coach under accusations of sexual contact with students. Nathan Stock was later charged with: providing drugs to students, institutional sexual assault, corruption of minors and unlawful contact with a minor, as well as misdemeanor charges of corruption of minors and indecent assault.\n\nThe Bermudian Springs School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the district in 2012. Additionally, there were two incidents of harassment and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in six incidents at the schools, with no arrests. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online.\n\nThe Bermudian Springs School Administration reported there were no incidents of bullying occurring in the schools in 2009. Additionally, two students were assaulted and seven incidents of harassment occurred at the schools.\n\nBermudian Springs School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. District administration are required to annually provide the following information with the district's Safe School Report: the board's bullying policy, a report of bullying incidents in the school district, and information on the development and implementation of any bullying prevention, intervention or education programs. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives.\n\nEducation standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.\n\nIn 2013, Bermudian Springs School District was awarded $25,000 in a state Safe Schools Targeted Grant. The maximum of $25,000 grants were awarded through a competitive application process. The funds must be used for research based interventions, like: peer mediation, staff training in managing behavioral issues and creating a positive school climate.\n\nBy law, Pennsylvania's public school teachers are evaluated achieving one of two ratings, satisfactory or unsatisfactory. The evaluation provides no meaningful feedback in areas where an educator could improve.\n\nIn June 2012, the Pennsylvania General Assembly established the new evaluation method, is to be implemented in the 2013-14 school year, will include multiple measures of student achievement, such as the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment, the Pennsylvania Value Added Assessment System, graduation and promotion rates, as well as other elective data to be determined at the local level.\n\nBermudian Springs School District did not volunteer to participate in the state's pilot project with the Pennsylvania Department of Education to develop statewide policy, tools and processes to evaluate teachers and principals in which student achievement is a significant factor affecting performance ratings. Secretary of Education Ron Tomalis announced that 104 K-12 entities, including nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units, signed-up to participate in the new teacher and principal evaluation pilot program. The initiative is funded by a Gates Momentum grant. During the 2011-12 school year, more than 120 school districts, charter schools, intermediate units, and career and technology centers participated in the second implementation phase of the new teacher evaluation tool. This included more than 650 supervisors and nearly 5,000 teachers in 366 school buildings participating in the pilot project.\n\nThe final phase of the updated public education professionals evaluation system will be implemented during the 2012-13 school year with 264 local education agencies, consisting of 1,387 school buildings, 1,892 principals/supervisors and more than 31,600 teachers included In advocating for the new evaluation system, Secretary of Education Ronald Tomalis reported that research demonstrated that the performance of an educator has a direct impact on the future success of students. The new evaluation system will become effective for teachers and principals in the 2014-15 school year. Pennsylvania will join at least 22 states in using student achievement to evaluate educators.\n\nPennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1.\n\nUnder Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days’ public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.\n\nIn 2015, the average teacher salary in BSSD was $56,025 a year.

School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. By law the state limits the total unreserved-undesignated fund balance at 8% of the annual budget for school districts that have budgets over $19 million a year.

In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year, plus they receive federal Social Security benefits. Both incomes are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools.\n\nAccording to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Bermudian Springs School District receives 40.7% of its annual revenue from the state. In December 2014, the Pennsylvania Education Funding Reform Commission conducted a hearing. The commission developed a new basic education funding formula which sets a new way to distribute state basic education dollars. It abolished the practice of \"hold harmless\" funding, which gave districts at least the same as they got the previous school year regardless of declining enrollment. The plan became law in June 2016 (House Bill 1552).\n\nFor the 2016-17 school year, Bermudian Spring School District received $6,114,259 in Basic Education Funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even when enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was determined by Governor Edward G. Rendell and the Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some public school districts at a far greater rate than others. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Pennsylvania spent $7,824 Per Pupil in the year 2000.

This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students, For 2010–11, the Bermudian Springs School District applied for and received $362,180 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide full-day kindergarten, to reform the high school program and to increase instructional time for struggling students through before and after school tutoring. In 2011-12 and 2012 13 the district received $133,436.\n\nBeginning in the 2014–2015 budget, the State funded a new Ready to Learn Grant for public schools. A total of $100 million is allocated through a formula to districts based on the number of students, level of poverty of community as calculated by its market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) and the number of English language learners.

The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget.\n\nBermudian Springs School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants; PA Science Its Elementary grants (discontinued effective with 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell); Education Assistance Grants; 2012 and 2013 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grants, 2012 and 2013 Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants; Project 720 High School Reform grants; nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants.\n\nBermudian Springs School District received an extra $1,141,382 in ARRA – Federal Stimulus money to be used only in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software.\n\nBermudian Springs School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. According to then Governor Rendell, failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.\n\nThe Federal government provides annual grants to schools to be used to improve the quality of teacher instructions to pupils. The goal is to provide each child in public schools with “High Quality” teachers and principals as defined by the state. The funds are sent to the state Department of Education which distributes them to each school district and charter school. Beginning in 2002, the federal funding committed to Title II was $3,175,000,000.\n\nPublic school district administrations must apply to the state annually for the Title II funds. In 2012-13, Bermudian Spring School District received $63,637 in federal Title II funding. In 2014-15, Bermudian Spring School District applied for and received $59,746.\n\nThe Federal government provides annual grants to schools to assist in educating immigrant children and children who are identified as limited English proficient. Upon registering for school a language survey is done for all new enrollment pupils, typically in kindergarten or preschool. They identify the primary language spoken at home. This data is collected and submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, which in turn notifies the federal government.\n\n\nThe Bermudian Springs School Board decided to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes.\n\nProperty tax rates in 2016-17 were increased by the Bermudian Springs School Board to 10.9265 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. An increase of 0.2246 mills will generate about $226,209 for the school district. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75–85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate – land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes.\n\n\nThe average yearly property tax paid by Adams County residents amounts to about 3.48% of their yearly income. Adams County ranked 382nd out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income. According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).\n\nThe Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011–2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. With the 2011 state education budget, the General Assembly voted to end most of the Act 1 exceptions leaving only special education costs and pension costs. The cost of construction projects will go to the voters for approval via ballot referendum.\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the Bermudian Springs School District 2006–2007 through 2011–2012.\n\n\nFor the 2016-17 budget year, Bermudian Springs School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the district's Act 1 Index limit.

Each year the Bermudian Springs School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.\n\nAccording to a state report, for the 2011–2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.\n\nIn January 2010, the school board applied to the Pennsylvania Department of Education for referendum exemptions to raise taxes above the Act 1 limit which for 2010 was set at 3.88 percent – or 1.6 mills for Bermudian Springs School District. In April 2010, the board was notified that the request was rejected. When the Pennsylvania Department of Education denies the request, the school district must (1) reduce the tax rate increase to no more than its index or (2) submit a referendum question for voter approval in the next primary election (for school districts with a July 1 through June 30 fiscal year).\n\nIn the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.\n\nIn 2016, Bermudian Springs School District approved 3,603 homestead properties received $169. The increase in amount was due to a decrease in the number of the homeowners receiving relief in the district.\n\nIn 2013, Bermudian Springs School District approved 3,629 homestead properties to receive $167. In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Bermudian Springs School District was $167 per approved permanent primary residence with 3,607 approved residences. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief for the Bermudian Springs School District was $168 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 3,585 property owners applied for the tax relief. Among Adams County school districts, in 2009 and in 2010, Upper Adams School District received the highest relief allocation at $279. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. Chester-Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Adams County, 74% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.\n\nAdditionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided to Bermudian Springs School District low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so people who make substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.\n\nPennsylvania Department of Education projections of Bermudian Springs School District do not anticipate a growth in enrollment for the next decade. A Standard and Poors study found that an optimal school district size, to conserve administrative costs, was around 3000 pupils. Consolidation of administrations with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings for people in both communities. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any schools. According to a 2009 proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improving high school student academic achievement, enriching the curriculum programs or to reducing local property taxes.\n\nMore than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater). Pennsylvania Department of Education data shows that from 1999–2000 to 2008–09 there has been a 12 percent increase in public school staff even as there was a 1 percent decline in enrollment. Pennsylvania schools added 17,345 professional employees and 15,582 support workers over this time, while enrollment declined by 26,960.
