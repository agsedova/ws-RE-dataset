He is known only through brief descriptions by classical writers and was \"an unusual man by all accounts\", though a man of loyal democratic values.\n\nChaerephon is mentioned by three writers of his time, all of whom were probably well acquainted with him: Aristophanes, Xenophon, and Plato. Considered together, these sources suggest that Chaerephon was a well-known, alert, energetic, engaging individual, possibly with a distinctive physical appearance and probably a bit of a \"character\", who moved easily in the social and intellectual circles of the day.\n\nChaerephon appears in three of Aristophanes' comic plays: \"The Clouds\", \"The Wasps\", and \"The Birds\". \"The Clouds\", produced in 423 BCE, portrays Socrates and his assistant Chaerephon as a pair of charlatans operating a pseudo-scientific school in Athens. Chaerephon is represented in \"The Clouds\" as pale and malnourished, a \"living corpse\", and it is sometimes inferred that he must have been a thin, unhealthy looking fellow in real life. In \"The Wasps\" Chaerephon, or some visual caricature of him, has a brief, non-speaking role as an impartial witness. In \"The Birds\" he is nicknamed \"the bat\", possibly alluding to nocturnal habits, a bony appearance, or a sudden, excitable nature (as suggested in Plato's works, below).\n\nIn his \"Memorabilia\" Xenophon includes Chaerephon in his list of the \"true companions\" of Socrates. Also in the Socratic inner circle, according to Xenophon, were Crito, Hermogenes, Simmias of Thebes, Cebes of Thebes, Phaedondes, and Chaerephon's younger brother Chaerecrates, although Xenophon acknowledges that there were others. Later in the \"Memorabilia\", Xenophon recounts an exchange between Socrates and Chaerecrates on the occasion of a falling-out between the brothers. Socrates argues persuasively that Chaerecrates should make every effort to achieve a prompt reconciliation with his older brother Chaerephon.\n\nIn Plato's \"Apology\", an account of the Trial of Socrates in 399 BCE, Socrates calls Chaerephon his longtime friend and the friend of many present. Socrates says that Chaerephon is now deceased but indicates that his brother is in attendance at the trial. Socrates suggests that Chaerephon had a reputation for being impetuous and we learn that it was Chaerephon who journeyed to Delphi to ask the Delphic oracle who was the wisest of men. (The oracle replied that there was none wiser than Socrates.) Socrates also alludes to a period of exile which was endured by Chaerephon and some others present. This is sometimes taken as evidence that Chaerephon, unlike Socrates, was an active supporter of the Athenian Democracy and was persecuted on this account when the democracy was temporarily deposed after the defeat of Athens by Sparta.\n\nChaerephon appears in two other Platonic dialogues: the \"Charmides\" and the \"Gorgias\". At the start of the \"Charmides\", Socrates returns to Athens from the military campaign at Potidaea and is greeted with great enthusiasm by Chaerephon who is described as \"a wild man\". This campaign concluded in 430 BCE (3 years before Plato's birth and 31 years before Socrates' death), but Plato is probably accurate in depicting the association of Chaerephon and Socrates as already well established. At the start of the \"Gorgias\", Chaerephon and Socrates arrive late at an Athenian gathering for an evening of conversation with Gorgias, a famed Sophist. Socrates good-naturedly blames their lateness on Chaerephon, who chatted too long in the Agora. Chaerephon then says that Gorgias is a friend of his and, with some coaching by Socrates, he serves satisfactorily as Gorgias' initial interlocutor in the early part of the dialogue.\n\n\n"}

He departed \"Neighbours\" in 1993, but returned in 2004 and has played Paul ever since. During his time away from \"Neighbours\" he was a cast member of Scottish soap opera \"River City\". He is also known for his 1989 hit single \"Don't It Make You Feel Good\", which reached Number 16 in the Irish and UK Singles Chart.\n\nDennis was born in Tawonga, Victoria but his family moved to Queensland for 12 years, where he did most of his schooling. He started showing his genuine interest in music and acting at the age of seven and was eleven years old when he started in amateur theatre in Queensland. His debut with this first theatre company was in \"Oliver!\". Also, at this time he and his brother formed a vocal duo and performed on many occasions. They played at weddings, charity events, and some large concerts.\n\nBy the age of 14, Dennis was convinced he wanted to go into the entertainment business. He understood the pitfalls associated with choosing the career of an entertainer, so he decided to get a trade behind him to support him through the times when he might be out of work. He left school at 15 and took an apprenticeship as a chef. On completion of his chef's certificate, he moved from the Gold Coast to Melbourne. In the following five years, he worked hard gaining knowledge and experience.\n\nDennis started out in guest roles on programmes such as \"Cop Shop\", \"Skyways\", \"Carson's Law\", \"Young Ramsay\", \"Prisoner\", \"Home\", \"The Henderson Kids\", \"The Sullivans\", \"The Young Doctors\" and many others. Dennis has a number of credits to his name. He had a major role in \"The Henderson Kids\", a co-lead in an ABC children's show called \"Infinity Limited\", and he co-starred in \"The Flying Doctors\" mini-series. In 1984, he auditioned for the roles of Shane Ramsay and Des Clarke in a new soap opera, \"Neighbours\" where he was later cast as Paul Robinson instead. Through the role in \"Neighbours\" came opportunities like appearing at the \"Royal Variety Performance\" along with other cast members.\n\nAfter finishing \"Neighbours\" in 1992, Dennis moved to the UK and worked on a variety of TV shows and theatre productions. He appeared in many pantomimes, plays, and musicals. In 1994, he played Mickey in \"Blood Brothers\", touring in New Zealand and Australia before returning to the UK to appear in the show in both the West End, and in a national tour of the UK. He appeared in many television shows, including \"Dream Team\", \"River City\", \"The Bill\" and \"Casualty\". He also returned to Australia from time to time for guest roles in shows such as \"Blue Heelers\", \"Good Guys Bad Guys\" and \"Stingers\". Dennis has worked as a voiceover artist for many years both in Australia and the UK.\n\nHe was part of the team that set a new world record in 1995 for 24-hour endurance outdoor karting. The team – Stefan Dennis, David Brabham, Russ Malkin, Steve Malkin – set the record of on a track at Brooklands, Weybridge, Surrey, UK on 24 and 25 February 1995. While in the UK, Dennis became a partner in Lex Film Entertainment, and was associate producer on the film \"The Truth About Love\". He also met and married his wife, Gail. The couple have two sons, Cameron and Declan, and a daughter Darci. The family are now back living in Australia.\n\nHe returned to \"Neighbours\" at the end of 2004, and was a regular character once again as of 2005, signing a three-year contract which ran to the end of 2008, which he has now extended. He is the only current cast member who appeared in the first episode, although he is not the longest serving due to his long break. Of his role in \"Neighbours\", Dennis has said that people struggle to tell the difference between himself and the character and \"shy away\" from him because \"they think I'm going to bark at them\". He has conceded that it could be a testament to his acting and says \"It's a real compliment though, as people know the character that well, they actually think I am like him in real life\".. As a matter of fact, although he portrays Paul Robinson as having a prosthetic leg, he has two good legs of his own. \n\nIn 2009, Dennis was stalked by two fans while presenting the Best Villain award at the British Soap Awards. He hosted a documentary special celebrating \"Neighbours\" 30th anniversary titled \"\", which aired in Australia and the UK in March 2015. In 2018, Dennis appeared in the recurring role of Michael Armstrong QC in the sixth series of \"Wentworth\".\n\nDennis' older brother, John, was killed by a drunk driver at the age of 12. Of the sentencing, Dennis has said: \"That driver was fined just $50 for what he did. And that same weekend someone who killed a koala at Currumbin Sanctuary got fined $200. So … well, that's hard.\" Dennis has used the incident to raise awareness about drink driving via his Twitter account.\n\nIn 1989, Dennis started a side-line music career, and released the single \"Don't It Make You Feel Good\", which reached No. 16 in the UK Singles Chart, in May of that year. He released a second single, \"This Love Affair\", which reached No. 67 in the UK in October 1989.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was regarded as a promising midfielder as well as one of the best dribblers in Lyon history. After five years at Le Havre, he went on to play for Olympique Lyonnais in 1998.\n\nHe had a brief spell at league rivals FC Girondins de Bordeaux from 2001 to 2002, before he returned to Lyon in 2002. He won two French Ligue 1 championships with Lyonnais in 2003 and 2004, and moved abroad to play for Italian club A.C. Milan in 2004. He was an unused substitute in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, when Liverpool beat A.C. Milan on penalties, but won a runners-up medal.\n\nDhorasoo moved back to France in 2005, signing for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). He was an important part of the PSG squad that won the 2006 Coupe de France, as he scored on a 25-yard shot in the final and secured the victory against fierce rivals Olympique de Marseille.\n\nHe was selected for the French squad at the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals, but only saw limited playing time during the tournament. At his short spell in Paris, many reporters say he was \"the orchestrator of the Parisian club's game\".\n\nIn September 2006, he criticised manager Guy Lacombe in an interview with L'Equipe, and a month later his contract with PSG was terminated, being the first player to be sacked from a French club since 1973.\n\nOn 3 July 2007, Livorno announced to have signed Dhorasoo with a statement on their official website However, Livorno rescinded his contract in October of the same year due to differences with the club. According to the club's president Aldo Spinelli, Dhorasoo refused to play with the club's youth side, which would have helped re-evaluate the player's fitness levels. Spinelli felt that this left the club with only one option, and that was to terminate the player's contract. Though Ligue 2 side Grenoble made an approach to sign the player, he finally announced his retirement on 11 January 2008.\n\nWhile at Lyon, Dhorasoo made his debut for the French national team in a goalless draw against Ukraine on 27 March 1999. He played another national team match in June 1999, before his national team career went into a five-year , he scored one goal in eighteen appearances for the French national team.\n\nDhorasoo was called up for the French national team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification in September 2004, and he represented the country at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. After the World Cup, Dhorasoo publicly revealed the time spent in the French squad during the monthlong tournament, through a documentary, much to the anger of French national team manager Raymond Domenech and the FFF. Dhorasoo was warned against publishing the documentary. He retired from the French national team, saying \"I am not interested in playing for Les Bleus any more. It's over.\"\n\nDhorasoo made 18 national team appearances between 1999 and 2006, scoring a single goal in a heavy defeat of Cyprus.\n\nDhorasoo is of Indo-Mauritian origin. His Telugu-speaking forefathers hailed from Vizianagaram in India's Andhra Pradesh, migrated to Shiraz in Iran and then to Mauritius to work on the sugarcane plantations of the paradise islands. Vikash's parents and siblings moved to France where Vikash was born as the fourth child. He began university studies in economics before committing to professional football.\n\nDhorasoo's favorite music group is Belle and Sebastian and his favorite author is Jonathan Coe.\n\nHe is married to longtime girlfriend Émilie and has two daughters, Rose (born 8 March 2003), and Sara (13 March 2005).\n\nHe has spoken out against bigotry and in 2003 he started actively supporting Paris Foot Gay, a football club which combats homophobia and other discrimination in the sport.\n\nDhorasoo also works actively to fight poverty in countries such as United States and has established several programs for it.\n\nIn the 2020 Paris municipal election, Dhorasoo ran as the mayoral candidate for La France Insoumise in the 18th arrondissement of Paris.\n\nIn July 2009, he became chairman of French football club L'Entente SSG.\n\nDuring the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Dhorasoo did some personal filming for a film called \"Substitute\", which was released the following year in France.\n\nHis most recent film is \"La très très grande entreprise\", released in November 2008.\n\nLyon\n\nBordeaux\n\nMilan\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\n"}

The kitten fell overboard, but managed to swim back to the vessel and climb aboard by scaling a rope; taking note of his strong survival instinct and intelligence, Flinders and the crew made him their favourite.\n\nTrim sailed with Flinders on on his voyage of circumnavigation around the Australian mainland and survived the shipwreck of on Wreck Reef in 1803. When Flinders was accused of spying and imprisoned by the French in Mauritius on his return voyage to England, Trim shared his captivity until his unexplained disappearance, which Flinders attributed to his having been stolen and eaten by a hungry slave.\n\nTrim was a bicolour cat, being black with white paws, chin and chest. He was named after the butler in Laurence Sterne's \"Tristram Shandy\", because Flinders considered him to be a faithful and affectionate friend. During his imprisonment, Flinders wrote a biographical tribute to Trim in which he described him as \"one of the finest animals I ever saw... [his] robe was a clear jet black, with the exception of his four feet, which seemed to have been dipped in snow and his under lip, which rivaled them in whiteness.

{"id": "1809277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809277", "title": "Divine Mercy", "text": "Divine Mercy\n\nThe Divine Mercy is a devotion to Jesus Christ associated with the apparitions of Jesus to Saint Faustina Kowalska. The venerated image under this Christological title refers to what Kowalska's diary describes as \"God's loving mercy\" towards all people, especially for sinners. Kowalska was granted the title \"Secretary of Mercy\" by the Holy See in the Jubilee Year of 2000.\nKowalska reported a number of apparitions during religious ecstasy which she wrote in her 1934-1938 diary, later published as the book \"\". The two main themes of the devotion are to trust in Christ's endless goodness, and to show mercy to others acting as a conduit for God's love towards them.\nPope John Paul II, a native of Poland, had great affinity towards this devotion and authorized it in the Liturgical Calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. The liturgical Feast of the Divine Mercy is celebrated on the first Sunday after Easter. Worshippers of the Divine Mercy commemorate the Hour of Mercy (3 p.m.), which according to Kowalska's diary is the time of the death of Jesus. Another very popular form of the devotion is the Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Some members of the Anglican Communion also share its pious beliefs and devotions in an effort towards church renewal. The devotion is believed to be the preparation for the end time.\n\nThe term and concept of divine mercy in Catholicism is from the Hebrew word chesed, which in the Bible can be translated as \"great mercy,\" \"goodness,\" \"loving-kindness, \"steadfast love,\" \"covenant faithfulness,\" \"favor,\" \"grace,\" or \"love and mercy,\" and which refers to God's love for the Children of Israel and for all of mankind.\n\nThe primary focus of the Divine Mercy devotion is the merciful love of God and the desire to let that love and mercy flow through one's own heart towards those in need of it. As he dedicated the Shrine of the Divine Mercy, Pope John Paul II referred to this when he said: \"Apart from the mercy of God there is no other source of hope for mankind\".\n\nThere are seven main forms of this devotion:\n\n\nAs in the prayers that form the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, there are three main themes to the Divine Mercy devotion: to ask for and obtain the mercy of God, to trust in Christ's abundant mercy, and finally to show mercy to others and act as a conduit for God's mercy towards them.\n\nThe first and second elements relate to the signature \"Jesus I trust in You\" on the Divine Mercy image and Kowalska stated that on April 28, 1935, the day the first Divine Mercy Sunday was celebrated, Jesus told her: \"Every soul believing and trusting in My Mercy will obtain it.\"\n\nThe third component is reflected in the statement \"Call upon My mercy on behalf of sinners\" attributed to Jesus in Kowalska's diary (Notebook I, items 186-187). This statement is followed in the diary by a specific short prayer: \"O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of Mercy for us, I trust in You.\" which Kowalska also recommended for the Hour of Divine Mercy. In her diary (Notebook II, item 742) Kowalska wrote that Jesus told her: \"I demand from you deeds of mercy, which are to arise out of love for Me.\" and that he explained that there are three ways of exercising mercy toward your neighbor: the first-by deed, the second-by word, the third-by prayer.\n\nThe Divine Mercy devotion views mercy as the key element in the plan of God for salvation and emphasizes the belief that it was through mercy that God gave his only son for the redemption of mankind, after the fall of Adam. The opening prayer for Divine Mercy Sunday Mass refers to this and begins: \"Heavenly Father and God of Mercy, We no longer look for Jesus among the dead, for He is alive and has become the Lord of Life\".\n\nIn 1959 the Vatican banned the image and devotion to it because of a number of factors. Some Polish bishops questioned Kowalska's claims and were uncomfortable with the image's similarity to the red and white Polish flag. Polish priests were reported to be interpreting the rays as a symbol of the flag. The ban on devotion was lifted on April 15, 1978, due to pressure from future Polish pope Karol Wojtyła, who had great interest on Kowalska.\n\nPaint an image according to the pattern you see with the signature: Jesus, I trust in You... I promise that the soul that will venerate this image will not perish.\n\nThe chaplet is associated with the paintings of the image as in Kowalska's diary. The most widely used is an image painted by Adolf Hyla. Hyla painted the image in thanksgiving for having survived World War II.\n\nIn the image, Jesus stands with one hand outstretched in blessing, the other clutching the side wounded by the spear, from which proceed beams of falling light, coloured red and white. An explanation of these colors was given by Kowalska, which she attributed to Jesus in her diary: \"The two rays represent blood and water\". These colors of the rays refer to the \"blood and water'\" of the Gospel of John () which are also mentioned in the optional prayer of the Chaplet. The words “Jesus I Trust in Thee” usually accompany the image (\"Jezu Ufam Tobie\" in Polish).\n\nThe original Divine Mercy image was painted by Eugene Kazimierowski in Vilnius, Lithuania, under Kowalska's direction. However, according to her diary, she cried upon seeing that the finished picture was not as beautiful as the vision she had received, but Jesus comforted her saying, \"Not in the beauty of the colour, nor of the brush is the greatness of this image, but in My grace\". The picture was widely used during the early years of the devotion, and is still in circulation within the movement, but the Hyla image remains one of the most reproduced renderings. After the Feast of Divine Mercy Sunday was granted to the Universal Church by Pope John Paul II on 30 April 2000 new versions of the image have emerged from a new generation of Catholic artists.\n\nIn her diary Kowalska wrote that Jesus specified 3:00 p.m. each day as the hour at which mercy was best received, and asked her to pray the Chaplet of Mercy and venerate the Divine Mercy image at that hour. On October 10, 1937, in her diary (Notebook V, item 1320) Kowalska attributed the following statement to Jesus:\nThe time of 3:00 p.m. corresponds to the hour at which Jesus died on the cross. This hour is called the \"hour of Divine Mercy\" or the \"hour of great mercy\".\n\nThe feast of Divine Mercy Sunday was instituted by Pope John Paul II and is celebrated the Sunday after Easter on the General Roman Calendar, and is associated with specific indulgences.\n\nIn an entry in her diary, Kowalska stated that anyone who participates in the Mass and receives the sacraments of Confession and the Eucharist on this day is assured by Jesus of full remission of their sins and punishments.\n\nA number of Marian churches and shrines have been dedicated to Divine Mercy. One of the most important is the Gate of Dawn in Vilnius, when also the Divine Mercy image was exhibited for the first time.\n\nThe worldwide center of the devotion is Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Kraków), commonly known as Łagiewniki. This is where Kowalska is interred, and it houses the most popular version of the Divine Mercy image (by Adolf Hyła).\n\nThe Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Vilnius) houses Eugeniusz Kazimirowski's initial rendition.\n\nThe Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Płock) is where Kowalska is said to have had the first vision of the Divine Mercy image. The Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Białystok) has the remains of Michał Sopoćko, the spiritual director of Kowalska and the \"Apostle of Divine Mercy\". Głogowiec, Łęczyca County as well as nearby Świnice Warckie (central Poland) are the places of birth and childhood as well as baptism and first communion of Kowalska.\n\nThe church of Santo Spirito in Sassia is the main center of the Divine Mercy in Rome.

This can include paved areas, driveways, retaining walls, sleeper walls, stairs, walkways, and any other landscaping made up of hard wearing materials such as wood, stone, and concrete, as opposed to softscape, the horticultural elements of a landscape.\n\nHard landscaping involves projects that cover the entirety of the yard and that are necessary before soft landscaping features come into play. Hard landscaping is very much altering the foundation of the yard, the \"bricks and mortar\", and so only once this is completed can the landscaper begin to focus on the more beautiful features of the yard, hard-soft landscaping such as the floral arrangements, trees and shrubs and perfecting color schemes. One key feature of hard landscaping is to do with the absorption of water – something that is of great importance given the climate. Hard landscaping ensures that worrying about water after heavy rain or snowfall is not an issue. The right water absorption and irrigation system installed through hard landscaping, coupled with hard materials that safely move water away from the property can ensure that soil movement is never a problem and that the yard stays a drier, enjoyable living space, rather than a wet and muddy bog. There are soft landscaping options that can help to achieve this, but the bulk of this is achieved through hard landscaping.\n\nFrom an urban planning perspective, hardscapes can include very large features, such as paved roads, driveways or fountains, and even small pools. Most water features are hardscapes because they require a barrier to retain the water, instead of letting it drain into the surrounding soil.\n\nHardscaping allows the erection of man-made landscaping features that would otherwise be impossible due to soil erosion, including some that compensate for large amounts of human traffic that would cause wear on bare earth or grass. For example, sheer vertical features are possible.\n\nWithout nearby bare soil, or natural drainage channels or culverts, hardscape with an impervious surface requires artificial methods of drainage or surface runoff to carry off the water that would normally be absorbed into the ground as groundwater and prevent premature wear to itself. Lack of capacity, or poorly planned or executed drainage or grading of the surface can cause problems after severe storms or heavy extended periods of rain fall, such as flooding, washout, mud flows, sink holes, accelerated erosion, wet rot to wood elements, drowning of plants trees and shrubs, and even foundation problems to an adjacent home such as cracking the foundation, basement flooding due to water infiltration, and pest infiltration, such as ants and other insects entering through damaged areas.\n\nHardscape landscaping in Queensland, Australia is a licensed qualification called Structural Landscaping, which is divided into two classes of licenses: Trade Contractor Structural Landscaper, and a Builder restricted to Structural Landscaping, referred to as the \"jack of all trades\" due to its large scope of works. These Structural Landscaping licenses include the erection and fabrication of decking, fences, carports, pergolas, paving and the construction of retaining walls.\n\n"}

{"id": "1809306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809306", "title": "M13 bacteriophage", "text": "M13 bacteriophage\n\nM13 is a filamentous bacteriophage composed of circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) which is 6407 nucleotides long encapsulated in approximately 2700 copies of the major coat protein P8, and capped with 5 copies of two different minor coat proteins (P9, P6, P3) on the ends. The minor coat protein P3 attaches to the receptor at the tip of the F pilus of the host \"Escherichia coli\".\nThe life cycle of M13 is relatively short, with the early phage progeny exiting the cell ten minutes after infection. M13 is a chronic phage, releasing its progeny without killing the host cells.\nThe infection causes turbid plaques in \"E. coli\" lawns, of intermediary opacity in comparison to regular lysis plaques. However, a decrease in the rate of cell growth is seen in the infected cells. M13 plasmids are used for many recombinant DNA processes, and the virus has also been used for phage display, directed evolution, nanostructures and nanotechnology applications.\n\nThe phage coat is primarily assembled from a 50 amino acid protein called pVIII (or p8), which is encoded by gene VIII (or g8) in the phage genome. For a wild type M13 particle, it takes approximately 2700 motion copies of p8 to make the coat about 900 nm long. The coat's dimensions are flexible though and the number of p8 copies adjusts to accommodate the size of the single stranded genome it packages. For example, when the phage genome was mutated to reduce its number of DNA bases (from 6.4 kb to 221 bp), then the number of p8 copies was decreased to fewer than 100, causing the p8 coat to shrink in order to fit the reduced genome. The phage appear to be limited at approximately twice the natural DNA content. However, deletion of a phage protein (p3) prevents full escape from the host \"E. coli\", and phage that are 10-20X the normal length with several copies of the phage genome can be seen shedding from the \"E. coli\" host.\n\nThere are four other proteins on the phage surface, two of which have been extensively studied. At one end of the filament are five copies of the surface exposed pIX (p9) and a more buried companion protein, pVII (p7). If p8 forms the shaft of the phage, p9 and p7 form the \"blunt\" end that is seen in the micrographs. These proteins are very small, containing only 33 and 32 amino acids respectively, though some additional residues can be added to the N-terminal portion of each which are then presented on the outside of the coat. At the other end of the phage particle are five copies of the surface exposed pIII (p3) and its less exposed accessory protein, pVI (p6). These form the rounded tip of the phage and are the first proteins to interact with the \"E. coli\" host during infection. p3 is also the last point of contact with the host as new phage bud from the bacterial surface.\n\nBelow are steps involved with replication of M13 in \"E. coli\".\n\n\nPhage proteins in the cytoplasm are pII, pX, and pV, and they are part of the replication process of DNA. The other phage proteins are synthesized and inserted into the cytoplasmic or outer membranes.\n\n\nGeorge Smith, among others, showed that fragments of EcoRI endonuclease could be fused in the unique Bam site of f1 filamentous phage and thereby expressed in gene III whose protein pIII was externally accessible. M13 does not have this unique Bam site in gene III. \nM13 had to be engineered to have accessible insertion sites, making it limited in its flexibility in handling different sized inserts.\nBecause the M13 phage display system allows great flexibility in the location and number of recombinant proteins on the phage, it is a popular tool to construct or serve as a scaffold for nanostructures. For example, the phage can be engineered to have a different protein on each end and along its length. This can be used to assemble structures like gold or cobalt oxide nano-wires for batteries or to pack carbon nanotubes into straight bundles for use in photovoltaics.\n\n\n"}

Foglietta's father, Michael, was a Republican committeeman, ward leader and clerk of quarter sessions who was ultimately elected to the Philadelphia City Council in 1947. He received his bachelor's degree from Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia in 1949, and his Juris Doctor from the Temple University law school in 1952. After graduating from law school, he entered private practice.\n\nIn 1955, Foglietta ran for Philadelphia City Council. Foglietta won, becoming the youngest person ever elected to that body. Foglietta served on the Council for 20 years. In 1975, he ran for mayor of Philadelphia, coming in third place to Frank Rizzo. Following his defeat, Foglietta became a regional director for the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nIn the 1980 elections, Foglietta won in Pennsylvania's 1st Congressional District, running as an independent.

The boats weigh between 180 and 250 kilograms and are crewed by four rowers and a sweep.\n\nThe positions in the boat are as follows:\n\nBow (1) - the position nearest the bow (front) of the boat. Often regarded as the most dangerous of the positions.\n\nSecond Bow (2) - the next nearest the bow, their oar is on the opposite side to the bow rower's and these two rowers comprise the bow pair.\n\nSecond Stroke (3) - the next seat away from the bow and probably the seat closest to the centre of the boat, their main role is to stabilise the boat. Their oar is on the same side of the boat as the bow rower.\n\nStroke (4) - the seat closest to the stern (back) of the boat and the rower responsible for setting the speed and timing of the crew's rowing stroke. They combine with Second Stroke to make up the stern pair and their oar is on the same side as that of Second Bow.\n\nSweep - the person in charge of steering the boat and, as they're the only one who can see what's ahead, they generally call the shots on the water. They also frequently double as the crew's coach.\n\nThe boats race by rowing out to a marker buoy placed several hundred metres offshore, turning around it and returning to shore as quickly as possible. Boats work to avoid crashing through waves on the way out as they seriously slow progress, but aim to catch a wave as early as possible on the way back as this is the fastest method of travel for a boat. The surf factor is where things get interesting as boats slew sideways, roll, crash into each other, have sweeps and rowers thrown into the water - generally creating an exciting spectacle for spectators.\n\nPiha Surf Life Saving Club pioneered the use of surf rescue boats in New Zealand, with the country's first surf boat, launched in 1936. On 9 April 1939 the first ever surf boat race held in New Zealand took place at Piha Beach with Piha winning against Wainui Club. In 1940 a Piha crew comprising; Tom Pearce, Haden Way, Max Cleary, Jack Rae and Tiger O'Brien rowing in a randomly allocated boat were the inaugural winners of the National Surf Boat Championship Series, held at Wellington's Lyall Bay.\n\nIn 1967 Sir Jack Butland of Butland Industries provided the surf boat \"Piha\" built by Bailey Bros of Sydney to the club. In 1971 Sir Jack provided the club with \"Miss Chesdale.\" Another boat \"Ches'n' Dale\" was dedicated in 1979. More \"Ches'n'Dale\" boats followed, with numbers three and four donated in 1985.\n\nPiha won the gruelling Tuakua Sands River Race - from Tuakau to Port Waikato<nowiki> </nowiki>in 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986. In various competitions during 1987 Piha accumulated 33 wins and 2 seconds. In 1985 at Mount Maunganui a Piha crew comprising Steve Booten, Mike MacDonald, Peter Digan, Mark McCarthny and Mike Zainey as sweep became the first New Zealand \"Test\" Crew to beat Australia.\n\nThe first attempt at rowing a surf boat from Onehunga to Piha over the unpredictable and treacherous Manukau Heads<nowiki> </nowiki>Bar was made in April 1971. It was decided to negotiate the north channel as the safer south channel used by shipping would have added another seven kilometers to the row. As the crew comprising Andy Sekula, Mike Zainey, Ray Markham, Brian Sullivan and Alan Foubister rowed down the narrow northern channel with big dumping surf on either side, huge swells came up and the channel petered out leaving the boat in the surf zone. There was no route to get through the surf line leaving no option but to wait for a lull and head for the beach on a wave. The boat hit the beach with such force that the keel was split in half and all the ribs in the boat were broken. Despite the boat being a write off, sponsorship for the row and publicity gained about $2,000 for the club. The feat of getting all the way to Piha was not fully accomplished until 1992 with a crew comprising George Thompson, Brett Sullivan, Martin Wienk, Johan Broekhuizen, Duane Rice and Geoff Calvert rowing \"Lend Lease \"all the way to Piha. The trip took over five hours in high swells and stiff winds. At one stage in this row George Thomson was thrown overboard after the surf boat hit a swell.\n\nThe first Piha Big Wave Classic (Day of the Giants) was held at Piha Beach in April 2005 with 12 crews on the beach and Piha coming in second in the open men's race. These races, held annually are part of the national surf life saving championship surf boat series. In 2007 three crews came from Australia (Bronte, Jan Juc and Austinmer) to compete in these races. In 2014 Piha became the first club to win the trifecta at Piha - Mark HORSE Bourneville Swept 3 crews the Open Men's, Open Women's and Under 23 Men. The big wave classic will be held at Piha on February 21, 2015.\n\nIn 2008 Piha crews comprising James Dallinger, Brad Mytton, Hayden Smith, Craig Knox, Matt Kirke, Mark Bourneville and Bruce O'Brien won the European Open Surf Boat Championships (also known as the World Surf Rowing Championships) at Biarritz, France. In 2012 Piha A crew won the Battle of the Ditch Surfboat Race (New Zealand versus Australia) and became the first crew to win the Australian Surf Life Saving men's open Australian Surf Rowers League title.\n\nIn 2013 Piha became the first club to win 5 Golds Surf boat Medals at a New Zealand National Surf Life Saving Championships, Mark HORSE Bourneville Swept 3 crews and won 2 x double titles and a gold & silver with U19 (Open Men long and short courses, Under 23 Men long and short courses and under 19 Men long course).\n\nAt the 2014 New Zealand Nationals Phia A became the first crew to win 8 New Zealand titles in 5 consecutive seasons. The 2014 Piha A crew was Paul Gerritsen, Chris Morris, Scott Lissington, Benjamin Richards, Ben Scott and sweep Mark Bourneville. The under 23 crew also scored a first - the first to win 5 New Zealand National titles in the under 23 division, the crew included Mark Bournevilles two twin sons Cedric & Ludovik Bourneville. The club also became the first to win 4 of the 6 divisional New Zealand Surf Boat Series titles - Men's Open, Women's Open, Under 23 Men's and Under 19 Women.

In Flanders, the count appointed similar bailiffs (). The equivalent agent in the king's southern lands acquired after the inheritance of the County of Toulouse was the seneschal.\n\nOver time, the role of the baillages would be greatly extended as extensions of royal power, administration and justice. With the office of Great Seneschal vacant after 1191, the bailies became stationary and established themselves as powerful officials superior to provosts. A bailie's district included about half a dozen provostships. When appeals were instituted by the Crown, appeal of provost judgments, formerly impossible, now lay with the bailie. Moreover, in the 14th century, provosts no longer were in charge of collecting domainal revenues, except in farmed provostships, having instead yielded this responsibility to royal receivers (receveurs royaux). Raising local army contingents (ban and arrière-ban) also passed to bailies. Provosts therefore retained the sole function of inferior judges over vassals with original jurisdiction concurrent with bailies over claims against nobles and actions reserved for royal courts (cas royaux). This followed a precedent established in the chief feudal courts in the 13th and 14th centuries in which summary provostship suits were distinguished from solemn bailliary sessions.\n\nUnlike the local administration of Norman England through sheriffs drawn from the great local families, the bailiff was a paid official sent out by the government, who had no power network in the area to which he had been assigned, and, in the way of a true bureaucrat, owed his income and social status wholly to the central administration that he represented. \"He was therefore fanatically loyal to the king,\" Norman Cantor observes, \"and was concerned only with the full exercise of royal power.\" The cathedral schools and the University of Paris provided the clerks and lawyers who served as the king's bailiff.\n\n"}

His full title is \"Somdet Phra Saṅgharāja Sakalamahāsaṅghapariṇāyaka\" (; ; 'the Supreme Patriarch, the Head of all Members of the Sangha').\n\nAs early as the Sukhothai period (thirteenth to sixteenth centuries CE), there were city-dwelling and forest-dwelling orders, and there was more than one Supreme Patriarch appointed. In modern times, however, only one position is responsible for all fraternities and orders. From 1992 to 2016, the Supreme Patriarch was chosen from the most senior member of the Supreme Sangha Council and officially endorsed by the King. the Supreme Patriarch was formally appointed by the King of Thailand and co-signed by the Prime Minister, with consultation of the Sangha Supreme Council, an administrative body of the Thai Sangha. The Supreme Patriarch has legal authority to oversee both of Thailand's Theravada fraternities, the Maha Nikaya and the Dhammayuttika Nikaya, as well as the small minority of Mahayana Buddhists in the country. He is also the President of the Sangha Supreme Council.\n\nThere has been recent discussion about reforming the Thai Sangha's leadership structure, including a 2002 proposal which would have moved many of the Sangha Council's and the Supreme Patriarch's powers to a new executive council. However, in 2015, it seemed the junta was not pushing for new Sangha legislation after all, after the proposals led to many organized protests and heated debate.\n\nThe Supreme Patriarch was Somdet Phra Nyanasamvara Suvaddhana, who had served in this position since 1989. After suffering from increasingly serious health problems, died on 24 October 2013, aged a hundred years. In 2003, because of questions about the Supreme Patriarch's ability to fulfill his duties, the government of Thailand had appointed a special committee to act in his stead. In early 2004, Somdet Kiaw Upaseṇo was appointed acting Supreme Patriarch, an office that he held until his death in 2013.\n\nAfter the death of Somdet Kiaw, Somdet Chuang Varapuñño of Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen became the next acting Supreme Patriarch. Despite a nomination from the Supreme Sangha Council, his official appointment as Supreme Patriarch was stalled due a refusal of the Thai secular government to forward his nomination to the King. In December 2016, the junta passed an amendment to the Sangha Act changing the rules for appointment of the Supreme Patriarch to bypass the Supreme Sangha Council and allow the King of Thailand to appoint the Supreme Patriarch directly, with the Thai Prime Minister countersigning. While proponents considered the amendment a good way for politicians to solve the problems the Sangha had not been able to solve, opponents described the amendment as \"sneaky\" (). Chao Khun Prasarn Candasaro, vice-rector of the Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University and assistant-abbot of Wat Mahathat Yuwaratrangsarit, stated the amendment showed a grave lack of respect for the Sangha Council's authority, because the council had not been involved in the amendment at all. He argued that the Monastic Act had always given the final decision to the King anyway, and pointed out that all conflicts about the appointment were caused by the junta's National Reform Council, not by the Sangha itself. Finally, on 7 February 2017, Somdet Amborn Ambaro was appointed by King Rama X to serve as the next Supreme Patriarch out of five names given to him by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha. The appointment ceremony was held on 12 February at Wat Phra Kaew, Grand Palace.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1809324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809324", "title": "Pycnocline", "text": "Pycnocline\n\nA pycnocline is the cline or layer where the density gradient () is greatest within a body of water. An ocean current is generated by the forces such as breaking waves, temperature and salinity differences, wind, Coriolis effect, and tides caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun. In addition, the physical properties in a pycnocline driven by density gradients also affect the flows and vertical profiles in the ocean. These changes can be connected to the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients through the ocean, and the pycnocline diffusion controls upwelling. \n\nBelow the mixed layer, a stable density gradient (or pycnocline) separates the upper and lower water, hindering vertical transport. This separation has important biological effects on the ocean and the marine living organisms. However, vertical mixing across a pycnocline is a regular phenomenon in oceans, and occurs through shear-produced turbulence. Such mixing plays a key role in the transport of nutrients.\n\nTurbulent mixing produced by winds and waves transfers heat downward from the surface. In low and mid-latitudes, this creates a surface-mixed layer of water of almost uniform temperature which may be a few meters deep to several hundred meters deep. Below this mixed layer, at depths of 200–300 m in the open ocean, the temperature begins to decrease rapidly down to about 1000 m. The water layer within which the temperature gradient is steepest is known as the permanent thermocline. The temperature difference through this layer may be as large as 20℃, depending on latitude. The permanent thermocline coincides with a change in water density between the warmer, low-density surface waters and the underlying cold dense bottom waters. The region of rapid density change is known as the pycnocline, and it acts as a barrier to vertical water circulation; thus it also affects the vertical distribution of certain chemicals which play a role in the biology of the seas. The sharp gradients in temperature and density also may act as a restriction to vertical movements of animals.\n\nGrowth rate of phytoplankton is controlled by the nutrient concentration and the regeneration of nutrients in the sea is a very important part of the interaction between higher and lower trophic levels. The separation due to the pycnocline formation prevents the supply of nutrients from the lower layer into the upper layer. Nutrient fluxes through the pycnocline are lower than at other surface layers.\n\nThe microbial loop is a trophic pathway in the marine microbial food web. The term \"microbial loop\" was coined by Azam et al. (1983) to describe the role played by microbes in the marine ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycles where dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is returned to higher trophic levels via the incorporation into bacterial biomass, and also coupled with the classic food chain formed by phytoplankton-zooplankton-nekton. \n\nAt the end of phytoplankton bloom, when the algae enter a senescent stage, there is an accumulation of phytodetritus and an increased release of dissolved metabolites. It is particularly at this time that the bacteria can utilize these energy sources to multiply and produce a sharp pulse (or bloom) that follows the phytoplankton bloom. The same relationship between phytoplankton and bacteria influences the vertical distribution of bacterioplankton. Maximum numbers of bacteria generally occur at the pycnocline, where phytodetritus accumulates by sinking from the overlying euphotic zone. There, decomposition by bacteria contributes to the formation of oxygen minimum layers in stable waters.\n\nOne of the most characteristic behavioural features of plankton is a vertical migration that occurs with a 24-hour periodicity. This has often been referred to as diurnal or diel vertical migration. The vertical distance travelled over 24 hours varies, generally being greater among larger species and better swimmers. But even small copepods may migrate several hundred meters twice in a 24-hour period, and stronger swimmers like euphausiids and pelagic shrimp may travel 800 m or more. The depth range of migration may be inhibited by the presence of a thermocline or pycnocline. However, phytoplankton and zooplankton capable of diel vertical migration are often concentrated in the pycnocline. Furthermore, those marine organisms with swimming skills through thermocline or pycnocline may experience strong temperature and density gradients, as well as considerable pressure changes during the migration.\n\nPycnoclines become unstable when their Richardson number drops below 0.25. The Richardson number is a dimensionless value expressing the ratio of potential to kinetic energy. This ratio drops below 0.25 when the shear rate exceeds stratification. This can produce Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, resulting in a turbulence which leads to mixing. \n\nThe changes in pycnocline depth or properties can be simulated from some computer program models. The simple approach for those models is to examine the Ekman pumping model based on the ocean general circulation model (OCGM).\n\n\n\n"}

Ronald Onofre, \"51 N.Y.2d 476, 415 N.E.2d 936, 434 N.Y.S.2d 947 (1980)\", was an appeal against New York's sodomy laws, decided in the New York Court of Appeals.\n\nIn People v. Ronald Onofre, et al., the appeal consisted of several cases consolidated into one. The appellants were challenging the constitutionality of a 1965 law, New York Penal Law § 130.38, which made it a misdemeanor to engage in \"deviate sexual intercourse\" (defined to include anal and oral but not vaginal sex) with another person.\n\nRonald Onofre was convicted for violating New York Penal Law that made it a misdemeanor to engage in sodomy (encompassing anal and oral sex, not vaginal), when he was caught having sex with his 17-year-old male lover in his home. Conde Peoples, III and Philip Goss were convicted for engaging in oral sex in an automobile parked in downtown Buffalo. Mary Sweat was convicted for having oral sex with a man in a parked truck, also in Buffalo. All these defendants appealed their convictions and argued that the consensual sodomy statute was unconstitutional.\n\nThe Court ruled that on the basis of \"Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479\" (1965) and \"Stanley v. Georgia\", the above sexual actions, when consensual, should fall under the right to privacy alluded to in the Constitution. Specifically, the Court opined:\n\nThe People are in no disagreement that a fundamental right of personal decision exists; the divergence of the parties focuses on what subjects fall within its protection, the People contending that it extends to only two aspects of sexual behavior - marital intimacy (by virtue of the Supreme Court's decision in \"Griswold\") and procreative choice (by reason of \"Eisenstadt\" and \"Roe v. Wade\"). .\n\nThe Court also relied on \"Stanley\", a case where the court found violative of the individual's right to be free from governmental interference in making important, protected decisions a statute which made criminal the possession of obscene matter within the privacy of the defendant's home. The \"Onofre\" Court stated,\n\nIn light of these decisions, protecting under the cloak of the right of privacy individual decisions as to indulgence in acts of sexual intimacy by unmarried persons and as to satisfaction of sexual desires by resort to material condemned as obscene by community standards when done in a cloistered setting, no rational basis appears for excluding from the same protection decisions - such as those made by the defendants before us - to seek sexual gratification from what at least once was commonly regarded as \"deviant\" conduct, so long as the decisions are voluntarily made by adults in a noncommercial, private setting.\n\nThe Court concluded its ruling by stating:\n\nIn sum, there has been no showing of any threat, either to participants or the public in general, in consequence of the voluntary engagement by adults in private, discreet, sodomous conduct. Absent is the factor of commercialization with the attendant evils commonly attached to the retailing of sexual pleasures; absent the elements of force or of involvement of minors which might constitute compulsion of unwilling participants or of those too young to make an informed choice, and absent too intrusion on the sensibilities of members of the public, many of whom would be offended by being exposed to the intimacies of others. Personal feelings of distaste for the conduct sought to be proscribed by New York Penal Law § 130.38 and even disapproval by a majority of the populace, if that disapproval were to be assumed, may not substitute for the required demonstration of a valid basis for intrusion by the State in an area of important personal decision protected under the right of privacy drawn from the United States Constitution - areas, the number and definition of which have steadily grown but, as the Supreme court has observed, the outer limits of which it has not yet marked.\n\nThe 5-to-2 majority opinion was written by Judge Hugh R. Jones, who wrote that \"it is not the function of the penal law to provide for the enforcement of moral or theological values.\" Specifically, those concurring with the decision, believed that \"the People have failed to demonstrate how government interference with the practice of personal choice in matters of intimate sexual behavior out of view of the public and with no commercial component will serve to advance the cause of public morality or do anything other than restrict individual conduct and impose a concept of private morality chosen by the State.\" \n\nJudge Jasen concurred with the result. He rejected the \"Griswold\" analysis, but found that the law had no currently rational basis, much like Justice White's concurring opinion in \"Griswold\".\n\nJudge Domenick L. Gabrielli and Chief Judge Cooke dissented. In their opinion, the analysis utilized by the majority meant that \"all private, consensual conduct would necessarily involve the exercise of a constitutionally protected \"fundamental right\" unless the conduct in question jeopardize the physical health of the participant.\" They concluded their dissent by stating,\n\nThe fact remains that western man has never been free to pursue his own choice of sexual gratification without fear of State inference. Consequently, it simply cannot be said that such freedom is an integral part of our concept of ordered liberty as embodied in the due process clauses of the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n"}
{"id": "1809329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809329", "title": "Sangharaja", "text": "Sangharaja\n\nSangharaja (Pāli: \"sangha\" religious community + \"raja\" ruler, king, or prince) is the title given in many Theravada Buddhist countries to a senior monk who is the titular head either of a monastic fraternity (nikaya), or of the \"Sangha\" throughout the country. This term is often rendered in English as 'Patriarch' or 'Supreme Patriarch'.\n\nThe position of \"sangharaja\" has been assigned according to various methods in different countries and time periods. In some cases, the sangharaja is determined by absolute monastic seniority; the sangharaja is the monk who has spent the most rains retreats (vassa) as a monk. In other cases, royal appointment may play a role- the sangharaja may be appointed by the king, particularly in Southeast Asian countries where the monarchy is closely associated with Buddhism (Thailand, for example). Alternatively, the \"sangharaja\" may be chosen semi-democratically by monks or the laity (similar to the election of an abbot in some Theravada communities).\n\nThe authority and responsibility assigned to the \"sangharaja\" can also vary significantly. Traditionally, Buddhist monasticism has not imposed any particular obligation of obedience on Buddhist monks. Any monk can offer criticism of any other monk with regards to violations of disciplinary rules, and a monk is not bound to follow the orders or recommendations of another monk - even a senior monk. While in practice, the respect accorded to a senior monk and the standards of the local community often provide a significant impetus for requests from senior monks to be obeyed, there is no traditional or scriptural demand for such attitudes. Most monasteries – even in areas where a \"sangharaja\" has been appointed – remain primarily self-governing or, at the most, dependent on a single larger temple in the same region.\n\nAs such, in some cases the \"sangharaja\" is primarily a figurehead, a focal point and spokesman for Buddhist piety, but not endowed with any particular authority. Even without any clearly designated authority or responsibilities, a \"sangharaja\" can often effect significant changes in a Theravada country by employing the respect accorded to him and his office to mobilize monks and laymen for social or religious change. Preah Maha Ghosananda of Cambodia was an example of this type of \"sangharaja\" – one whose influence over the local religious community far exceeded any ecclesiastic authority that he may have wielded.\n\nIn other cases, the \"sangharaja\" may be part of a national or regional hierarchy that is responsible for settling issues of wider importance to the national \"sangha\". The Supreme Patriarch of Thailand operates in this mold, in association with the civil government. The central religious hierarchy is responsible for issues of national and regional importance- such as the curriculum of monastic schools, the creation of authoritative forms for scriptures and rituals, and reform issues of nationwide importance – leaving most local decisions to the discretion of individual temples and abbots (such as the ordination and disciplining of individual monks). The position of Sangharaja is currently defunct in Sri Lanka, as no Buddhist monk was appointed to this position in the last two centuries. Mahanayaka theros who act as the chief prelates of three main sects Siyam Nikaya, Amarapura Nikaya and Ramanna Nikaya are considered to be the highest ranked Buddhist monks in the country.\n\nIn pre-colonial Burma, the office of Sangharaja was known as the \"Thathanabaing\" (, literally 'Keeper of the Sāsana') or formally \"Mahāsaṅgharājā\" (), typically rendered into English as 'Primate', 'Archbishop' or 'Supreme Patriarch.' The Thathanabaing of Burma served as the head of the Buddhist order of monks (bhikkhu) in pre-colonial Burma, until its abolishment in 1938 by the British authorities in colonial Burma.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, from the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa (13th century) the title of Sangharaja has been created by the king Parakramabahu the great. In the beginning, this title of Sangharaja was also known as \"Mahasami\", the head of the Sangha community of the whole country. The first Sri Lankan Buddhist monk to hold this title was Dimbulagala Maha Kassapa Maha Thero. However some sources suggests that Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Thera, who was conferred with Sangharaja position by King Parakramabahu VI as the first Sangharaja of Sri Lanka. Welivita Sri Saranankara Thero who was appointed to this position by king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe in 1753, was the last Sangharaja of Sri Lanka.\n\nIn Cambodia and the former Khmer kingdoms, the sangharaja ( \"sanghreach\") was a senior monk appointed by the king who headed one of the countries monastic fraternities. From the period between 1855 and the beginning of the Khmer Rouge era, one sangharaja existed for the Cambodian branch of the Dhammayuttika Nikaya, and another for the Maha Nikaya. Because the Dhammayuttika order enjoyed closer ties to the throne, it officially had primacy in Cambodia despite constituting a small majority of Khmer monks.\n\nDuring the Khmer Rouge period, the role of sangharaja essentially vanished, as Buddhism was officially suppressed first by the Khmer Rouge. The Vietnam-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea began to reverse its stance in order to gain wider popular support for its rule, and the venerable Tep Vong was appointed the new sangharaja by the government in 1981, with both nikayas combined into a single unified order.\n\nUpon his return from exile in 1991, King Sihanouk appointed Bour Kry sangharaja of the Dhammayuttika order, returning Cambodia to the two-patriarch system. As the monarchy no longer has government status in Cambodia, the two fraternities are now officially equals. The full official title of the Supreme Patriarch of the Maha Nikaya is \"Samdech Preah Sumedhādhipati\", while the full official title of the Supreme Patriarch of the Dhammayuttika Nikaya is \"Samdech Preah Sugandhādhipati\".\n\nThe Sangharaja (; ) of Thailand is traditionally appointed by the king, Rama I having appointed the first of modern times in 1782. Since passage of the Sangha Act of 1902 in the reign of Rama V, the office has tended to alternate between ordained monks of the majority order of Maha Nikaya, and of the minority order of Dhammayuttika Nikaya. The latter began as a reform movement within the larger order, established by Prince Mongkut, while he was an abbot with the ordination name of Vajirañāṇo, before ascending the throne as Rama IV.\n\n\nIn 1988, Maha Ghosananda was elected Supreme Patriarch by a group of exiled monks in Paris, however this status was not officially recognized in Cambodia. During this same period, Tep Vong held the same office in the unified Cambodian sangha, and after 1991 as the Supreme Patriarch of the Maha Nikaya.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1809339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809339", "title": "291 (art gallery)", "text": "291 (art gallery)\n\n291 is the commonly known name for an internationally noted art gallery that was located in Midtown Manhattan at 291 Fifth Avenue in New York City from 1905 to 1917. Originally known as the \"Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession\", the gallery was created and managed by photographer Alfred Stieglitz.\n\nThe gallery is noted for two reasons. First, the exhibitions there helped bring art photography to the same stature in America as painting and sculpture. Pioneering artistic photographers such as Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Gertrude Käsebier and Clarence H. White all gained critical recognition through exhibitions at 291. Equally important, Stieglitz used this space to introduce to the United States some of the most avant-garde European artists of the time, including Henri Matisse, Auguste Rodin, Henri Rousseau, Paul Cézanne, Pablo Picasso, Constantin Brâncuși, and the Dadaists Francis Picabia and Marcel Duchamp.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century photography's place in the world of fine art was still very indefinite. Although there had been major exhibitions of photography in the Europe and in the U.S., all of them had been judged by painters and sculptors. Photographers were not considered \"real\" artists, even though many photographers had won awards in international salons. Stieglitz himself had won over 150 awards throughout the world by the end of the 1890s.\n\nStieglitz had hoped to elevate the position of photography by convincing the New York Camera Club to allow him to put together a panel of photographers who would then be the sole judges of a photography competition. After more than a year of arguing with the directors of the Camera Club, many of whom did not have any passion for photography as art, Stieglitz gave up and began looking for other forums.\n\nIn late 1900 he met Edward Steichen, who had been trained as a painter but who had also taken up photography. Steichen shared the enthusiasm and passion of Stieglitz, and soon the two were planning how to change the course of photography in America. By the following year they had conceived of a great exhibition of photography, the first to be judged by photographers themselves, and had found a venue at the National Arts Club in New York. In March 1902, an exhibition of \"American Pictorial Photography, arranged by The Photo-Secession\" opened to critical acclaim. Moreover, Stieglitz had met his goal of having a show judged by photographers since, in spite of the title of the show, by all accounts he was the sole person responsible for selecting the exhibitors.\n\nThe following year Stieglitz further cemented his reputation as the leading proponent of fine art photography by launching the famed journal \"Camera Work\" with the assistance of his friend and fellow photographer Joseph Keiley. He expected that \"Camera Work\" would soon not only be funded completely by its subscribers but that additional income from the sales of the journal would allow him to further promote \"photography as a medium of individual expression.\" While the journal give him a respected forum for showcasing pictorial photography and for publishing his viewpoints, it was not a financial success. Rather than be daunted by this setback, Stieglitz became even more convinced that he would succeed in convincing the art world of the rightful place of photography if he could only find the right platform for his message.\n\nBy the end of 1904 Stieglitz was in a difficult position. Curtis Bell, president of the American Federation of Photography and an outspoken critic of Stieglitz, organized an exhibition called \"The First American Photographic Salon\" at the Clausen Galleries in New York. It was judged by a jury of eminent American painters, including William Merritt Chase and Robert Henri, which gave it considerable standing in the art world. Stieglitz and other photographers saw it as a direct challenge to Stieglitz's reputation, which it was clearly intended to be.\n\nStieglitz countered this move by trying to get some of the best known photographers of Europe to join him as part of a united front. He traveled to London to meet with some of the founders of the important photographic group The Linked Ring, including J. Crag Annan, Frederick H. Evans, Alvin Langdon Coburn and Alfred Horley Hinton. He was hoping to convince them to start a chapter of the Linked Ring in the United States, which he would direct. He also met with playwright George Bernard Shaw, who was an avid amateur photographer, about ways to promote photography as an art form. Unfortunately Stieglitz took ill before any of these conversations led to anything, and he had to return home. He was tired, frustrated and seeking a definitive new way to carry out his mission of promoting photography for photography's sake – independent of any other art form.\n\nWhen Stieglitz returned to New York in 1905 Edward Steichen was living in a studio apartment on the top (fifth) floor of a small building at 291 Fifth Avenue, between West 30th and West 31st Streets. Steichen noticed that some rooms across from him were vacant, and he soon convinced Stieglitz that they would make a perfect space to exhibit photography and in particular the works of the Photo-Secession. Stieglitz, who was still dejected from his trip to Europe, was reluctant at first, but Steichen persisted. By summer Stieglitz signed a one-year lease for three small rooms that would soon become one of the most famous art galleries in the world. The two of them began planning how to use the new space most effectively, not only as a gallery but as an educational facility for artists and photographers and as a meeting place for art lovers.\n\nIn October, 1905, Stieglitz sent a letter to all members of the Photo-Secession, saying:\n\nThe Council of the Photo-Secession had planned to hold in the City of New York, early next spring, an exhibition consisting of the very best that has been accomplished in pictorial photography throughout the world, from the time of Hill, the father of pictorial photography, up to date. Many of the prints had been selected for this purpose, but owing to the impossibility of securing at any price adequate gallery accommodations during the desirable New York season, this exhibition must be deferred.\n\nThe Photo-Secession, for the present thus unable to hold the proposed big exhibition, has determined to present in detail some of the work which had already been selected and which would have been embraced therein, and for that purpose has leased rooms at 291 Fifth Avenue, New York City, where will be shown continuous fortnightly exhibitions of from thirty to forty prints each. These small but very select shows will consist not only of American pictures never before publicly shown in any city in this country, but also Austrian, German, British, French and Belgian photographs as well as such other art productions, other than photographic, as the Council of the Photo-Secession can from time to time secure.\n\nIt is planned to make these rooms headquarters for all Secessionists and to open them to the public generally\".\n\nStieglitz and Steichen had planned the gallery as a commercial space, saying that it would \"negotiate sales in behalf of owners of picture exhibited, charging a commission of 15 percent for the benefit of the Photo-Secession treasury.\" This premise is thought to have been pushed by Steichen, who had a much better business sense, and over the years it became a point of contention between the two men. Stieglitz believed that it was better for an exhibited work to go to someone who appreciated it for its artistic merit rather than its investment potential, and he was known to have quoted wildly inconsistent prices for the same piece depending on what he perceived as the true interest of the potential purchaser.\n\nOn November 24, 1905, the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession formally opened its doors, with almost no public notice. The opening was attended mainly by those members of the Photo-Secession who were in New York at the time. The first exhibit consisted of one hundred prints by Photo-Secession members, selected entirely by Stieglitz. Over the next few weeks hundreds of New Yorkers came to the gallery, and Stieglitz was once again elevated to the position of standard bearer of artistic photographer in America.\n\nThe opening show was followed in January, 1906, by one of French photographers, including Robert Demachy, Constant Puyo and René Le Bégue, all of whom showed prints made by the gum bichromate process. This was followed by a two-person show of the works of Gertrude Käsebier and Clarence H. White. Four more exhibitions were held in 1906, including one of British photographers, early prints by Steichen, a show devoted to German and Austrian photographers, and another exhibition of prints by members of the Photo-Secession.\n\nAfter a highly successful first year, Stieglitz and Steichen felt that they had made their point about the stature of fine art photography. So confident were they of their success that their colleague Joseph Keily wrote \"today in America the real battle for the recognition of pictorial photography is over. The chief purpose for which the Photo-Secession was established has been accomplished – the serious recognition of photography as an additional medium of pictorial expression.\" \nIronically, Stieglitz began to feel that he had succeeded in transforming the Photo-Secession into something he once disliked – an established institution, set in its ways and complacent in its approach to art. If there was any truth to this statement it reflected directly back at Stieglitz since he was known for his authoritarian control of the Photo-Secession and in selecting what was exhibited at the gallery. Until now Stieglitz's discomfort was held in check by Steichen's more conservative nature, but in the summer of 1906 Steichen decided to move to Paris in order to devote more of his time to his photography and painting. Without Steichen's business eye watching over him, Stieglitz began to reclaim some of his radical roots.\n\nStieglitz decided to shake things up, and he did so by mounting the first non-photography show at the gallery in January, 1907. This is notable because it signaled the beginning of Stieglitz's role as a pioneer promoter of modern art in America. The show, drawings by artist Pamela Colman Smith, initially attracted little attention, but after a prominent critic praised the work it became the best attended exhibition to date. A substantial number of the works were sold, and interest in the show was so strong that it had to be extended eight days.\n\nStieglitz began planning for future non-photography shows, but for the remainder of 1907 the walls were filled with exhibits by such photographers as Adolf de Meyer, Alvin Langdon Coburn and, once again, members of the Photo-Secession.\n\nIn the meantime, Steichen had become friends with the famous sculptor Auguste Rodin in Paris, and he convinced Rodin to lend him some of his drawings for a show at the gallery in New York. The 1908 gallery season started with the show \"Drawings by Auguste Rodin\", the first exhibit in the United States of his works on paper. The show caused a significant amount of controversy in the press, with one critic saying \"they are not the sort of thing to offer to public view even in a gallery.\" \n\nSoon after that show ended Stieglitz was notified that the landlord wanted to double the rent and would require a four-year lease. At that time the Photo-Secession as a group had only a small income, no more than US$400 per year. In spite of minor successes, the original plan that membership fees and commissions would support the gallery had not been realized. Although he appealed to those members that he knew, the economy was in a significant downturn and no offers of assistance appeared. Since there was no other source of income, Stieglitz sadly went about closing the gallery. By April of that year the original gallery space had been emptied. It was immediately taken over by a ladies' tailor shop.\n\nStieglitz thought that his gallery was finished, but unknown to him a recent acquaintance named Paul Haviland emerged from studies at Harvard, learned about the closure of the gallery, and used some of his family's wealth to sign a three-year lease for a small space directly across the hall from the old gallery. After some convincing by Haviland that the new space was workable, Stieglitz gathered some other friends and came up with additional funds for utilities, supplies, printing and framing.\n\nThe new gallery space, which measured only fifteen feet square, was actually located in the next building on the block at 293 Fifth Avenue. The wall between the two buildings had been removed during a previous renovation, however, so by all appearances the new gallery seemed to share the same address as the old one.\n\nPerhaps to save money on printing and perhaps because of his affection for the old gallery, Stieglitz wanted the new address to remain \"291\". Both Haviland and he, however, agreed that the previous name of \"Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession\" was no longer appropriate. They wanted the new space to be about more than photography. Later, Stieglitz would write \"We are dealing, not with a society, not with an organization, as much as with a movement. The Secession is not so much a school or a following as an attitude towards life; and its motto seems to be: 'Give every man who claims to have a message for the world a chance of being heard.' \"\n\nFrom thenceforth Stieglitz referred to the gallery as \"291\", without the street name or other descriptive title. However, some of the original members of the Photo-Secession did not appreciate the name change and especially the thinking that led to it. Stieglitz's old friends Gertrude Käsebier and Clarence H. White saw it as the last straw in a series of autocratic moves by Stieglitz, and soon a series of increasingly bitter arguments broke out among the three of them. At one point Stieglitz wrote \"To my dismay, jealousies soon became rampant among photographers around me, an exact repetition of the situation I rebelled against at the Camera Club. Various Secessionists were in danger of harming not only each other but what I was attempting to build and demonstrate. I found, too, that the very institutionalism, commercialism and self-seeking I most opposed were actually favored by certain members.\" These differences of opinion were to increase over the next two years, exacerbated in part by Stieglitz's stubbornness and his refusal to include many of his long-time photographer friends in decisions about the direction of the new gallery.\n\nMeanwhile, Steichen returned to the U.S. in February 1908 with a new group of photos for a show to be held at the gallery the following month. More importantly, he brought with him a group of prints lent to him by Henri Matisse, who at that time little known outside France. Stieglitz promptly assembled the prints for a show in the new space. It was the first show of any work by Matisse in the United States and the first one-man show for the artist outside of Paris, and it marked the turning point in the focus of the gallery. After this show, 291 was known much less for photography and much more as a leading force for modern art in America. Moreover, Stieglitz continued to make sure that the gallery was not just an exhibition space; he strongly believed in its original mission as being an educational facility and meeting place for those with avant-garde ideas. Describing the Matisse exhibition, he wrote \"Here was the work of a new man, with new ideas – a very anarchist, it seemed, in art. The exhibition led to many heated controversies; it proved stimulating.\"\n\nIn addition to marking the beginning of a new path for 291, 1909 was significant for Stieglitz due to the death of his father in May. The two had not been particularly close, but in his will, Stieglitz's father left him the then substantial amount of $10,000. Stieglitz drew on this amount over the next several years to help keep 291 in business.\n\nThe new art and the public's reactions to it were very vitalizing to Stieglitz; it gave him a brand new set of admirers and followers at a time when he was feeling less and less connected to his old colleagues at the Photo-Secession. From then on, the course of the gallery was set. From 1909 until it closed in 1917, 291 featured only six shows of photography out of a total of 61 exhibitions held.\n\nThe change in the focus of the gallery led to a coalescence of group of intellectuals and artists who both sympathized with Stieglitz's aims and who themselves were invigorated by the atmosphere there. After the artistic success of the Matisse exhibit, the gallery took on a new life. On any given day, Stieglitz might have been surrounded by artists John Marin, Max Weber, Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley or Marius de Zayas; authors and art critics Sadakichi Hartmann and Benjamin De Casseres; financial supporters Paul Haviland and Agnes Ernst Meyer; and editors and collaborators Joseph Keiley and John Kerfoot.\n\nDe Zayas had both a passion and a vision that matched with Stieglitz's personality, and soon he was helping define what the aesthetics of this new generation of art would be. His work was exhibited at the gallery, he wrote several articles for \"Camera Work\", and he introduced Stieglitz to some of the newest European artists by serving as a guide and interpreter when Stieglitz would travel to Europe. His interest in African tribal art and admiration for Picasso's Cubist work convinced Stieglitz to hold groundbreaking exhibitions of these subjects at 291.\n\nFor historical context, virtually no other galleries in the United States were showing works with such abstract and dynamic content at that time. Whether it was already controversial European artists like Picasso, Matisse or Cézanne, or relatively unknown but soon-to-be-famous Americans like Marin, Weber, Dove or Hartley, Stieglitz had both the aesthetic sense and the nerve to showcase individuals who are now acknowledged to have been at the forefront of modern art.\n\nIn fact, the more an artist confounded the public the more Stieglitz felt justified in his efforts. When he presented Picasso's first exhibit in this country in 1911, Stieglitz delighted in telling critics that the works they called “the gibberings of a lunatic” he found to be “as perfect as a Bach fugue.”\n\nAmong the significant exhibitions that took place during this period were first shows for Alfred Maurer, John Marin and Marsden Hartley, second shows of Rodin and Matisse, and important shows for newer artists Arthur Carles, Arthur Dove and Max Weber.\n\nStarting in 1913 Stieglitz began to express an increasing amount of frustration over the changes that were happening in the world at that time. He wrote \"Much of the enthusiasm that had existed at 291 gradually disappeared because of the coming war. Close friends seemed to fall by the wayside.\" Stieglitz was especially troubled because his parents came from Germany, and he still had many close friends there. While he did not sympathize with the German war efforts, he \"could not see Germany as all wrong and the Allies as all right.\". At the same time, because of the depressed economy attendance at the gallery sharply declined and subscriptions to \"Camera Work\" dropped off. To make matters even worse, the small corps of volunteer workers at the gallery all but disappeared as people joined the armed forces or had to take on other jobs to help make ends meet.\n\nOnce again it was Haviland who came to the rescue. In early 1915 he told Stieglitz that 291 was in a rut, and something bold was needed to bring it back again. He assembled a close circle of relatively well-off friends, including Agnes Meyer and Dorothy Norman, and together with Stieglitz they came up with the idea of publishing a new magazine. They decided that this time it would be not only a magazine about art but a work of art itself, printed in a limited edition with very high quality paper and reproductions. The new magazine, which they all agreed should be called \"291\", appeared in March, 1915, to critical acclaim. Twelve issues of \"291\" were printed over the next fourteen months, showcasing some of the most avant-garde art and design of the times.\n\nUnfortunately, the magazine did little to revive the status of the gallery. Stieglitz continued to present some outstanding shows, but the overall effect of the mounting war tension on the economy could not be overcome. In 1916 Stieglitz met Georgia O'Keeffe. In the early years of their relationship O'Keeffe was an inspiration for Stieglitz's photography and a source of creative energy. Other male gallery owners at this time did not commonly seek out or display women's artwork, however, Stieglitz's believed in the legitimacy of females as artists and included Georgia's work in many group exhibitions, and in individual exhibition of her work on April 3, 1917. However his advertisement of O'Keeffe's work at his gallery and his representation of her as an artist was in a large part for her femininity and its presence in her work\n\nIn June, 1917, only two months after the United States declared war on Germany, Stieglitz closed \"291\". He made a photograph called \"The Last Days of 291\" (National Gallery of Art, Alfred Stieglitz Collection) which symbolized his feelings at the time. It depicts a model of a young soldier, armed with a sword and a broom, protecting works of art behind him. To his side is an older, bandaged warrior looking on, possibly representing Stieglitz himself as someone who had been wounded in the battle to protect the art that must now be guarded by a new generation.\n\nLater Stieglitz would return to New York to run two more galleries. From 1925 until 1929 he directed the Intimate Gallery, showcasing the work of American artists, including Marsden Hartley, Arthur Dove, John Marin, Paul Strand, Charles Demuth, and Georgia O'Keeffe, who by then had become his wife. In 1929 he opened \"An American Place\", where he presented the work of the \"Seven Americans\" (Hartley, Marin, Dove, Demuth, O'Keeffe, Strand and Stieglitz) until his death in 1946.\n\nIn 1914 Stieglitz published a series of responses to the question \"What is 291?\" in an issue of \"Camera Work\". Here are some of those writings:\n\nEugene Meyer responded with a free-form poem. To him 291 represented:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">An oasis of real freedom\nA sturdy Islet of enduring independence in the besetting seas of Commercialism and Convention\nA rest – when wearied\nA stimulant – when dulled\nA Relief\nA Negation of Preconceptions\nA Forum for Wisdom and for Folly\nA Safety valve for repressed ideas\nAn Eye Opener\nA Test –\nA Solvent\nA Victim and an Avenger</poem>\n\nJ. B. Kerfoot: \"291 is greater than the sum of all its definitions. For it is a living force, working for both good and evil. To me, 291 has meant an intellectual antidote to the nineteenth century...\":\n\nWilliam Zorach: \"I have visited 291 very often and to me it is a wonderful living place palpitating with red blood – a place to which people bring their finest and that brings out the finest that is within all those that come into actual contact with it.\"\n\nMarsden Hartley: \"A pure instrument is certainly sure to give forth pure sound. So has this instrument of 291 kept itself pure as possible that it thereby gives out pure expression.\"\n\nOver the gallery's 13-year existence, the exhibitions held there included an impressive list of firsts in both photography and modern art.\n\nIn 1917, Francis Picabia founded the magazine \"391\" in Barcelona, the title inspired by \"291\".\n\nThe definitive source book for 291 and the exhibitions held there is Sarah Greenough's massive \"Modern Art and America: Alfred Stieglitz and His New York Galleries\" (Washington: National Gallery of Art, 2000). This list is found on pp. 543–547.\n\n"}

He was the 6th Catholicos of the Holy Apostolic Throne of St. Thomas in Malankara and 19th Malankara Metropolitan.\n\nHe was born at Perinad in Kollam district of Kerala, and had his theological education at Old Seminary Kottayam and also at Basil Dayara, Pathanamthitta. Later he joined Bishop’s College, Calcutta for his B. D. Degree, and studied Theology at the General Theological Seminary, New York.\n\nHe was ordained as deacon in 1938 then as priest in 1941. Baselios Geevarghese II took special interest in the activities of Father Mathews. As a monk, Fr. Mathews stayed at St. George Dayara, Othara and led a prayerful life. The faithful members of the Church were attracted by the purity of life and refulgent smile of Fr. Mathews, and affectionately referred to him as \"\"Angel Achen\"\" (Malayalam: എയ്ഞ്ചെൽ അച്ചൻ,meaning 'angelic priest').\n\nOn 15 May 1953 he was ordained as bishop Mathews Mar Coorilose at the age of 38 by the Catholicos Baselios Geevarghese II. Mar Coorilose was appointed by the Catholicose to assist Metropolitan Alexios Mar Theodosius of Kollam Diocese. While he was Metropolitan of the Diocese of Kollam the number of parishes almost doubled within a short period. Several monasteries and convents were established. A large number of educational institutions and hospitals were also established. In addition. several Colleges, Schools, Hospitals and other service institutions were established and administered under his direct control and leadership. He traveled in various countries including the United States, Canada, Europe, Malaya, Singapore and Gulf countries, and attended various international meetings and conferences.\n\nIn 1980 he was unanimously elected by the Malankara Syrian Christian Association (the general assembly of representatives of the Church's parishes) as the successor-designate to the Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan.\n\nA Civil Service Academy was started at Thiruvananthapuram, to give proper training for candidates appearing for I. A. S.; I. P. S.; I. F. S. and other Central Service Examinations. With a view to provide shelter for the poor, a House Building Assistance project was started. When Catholicos Mathews I abdicated the throne due to ill health, Mar Coorilose was elevated to the throne of St Thomas as Baselious Marthoma Mathews II, Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan on 29 April 1991, becoming the Sixth Catholicos in Malankara and 89th Successor to the Holy Apostolic Throne of St Thomas.\n\nHe served as the President of the Ecumenical committee in Kerala and also on various other Inter-Church Committees. \nMathews II as the head of the Episcopal Synod of Malankara Orthodox Church canonized Mar Dionysius VI on the 69th feast day of the saint (24 February 2003). St. Dionysius is the second Indian Saint to be canonized by the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.\n\nDue to ill health from old age Mathews II resigned his position as the Supreme Head of the Indian Orthodox Church on 29 October 2005. He died three months later on 26 January 2006, and was interred at Mount Horeb Chapel, in Sasthamkotta on the 28th.\n\n"}

{"id": "1809364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809364", "title": "Rydalmere, New South Wales", "text": "Rydalmere, New South Wales\n\nRydalmere (formerly \"Field of Mars\") is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Rydalmere is approximately 21 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Parramatta.\n\nThe earliest grant in the area was to Phillip Schaeffer who settled in 1791. The district comprising modern day Rydalmere, Ermington and Dundas was initially called \"The Ponds\" because of such natural features occurring above Subiaco Creek. Shortly after Schaeffer's, further grants were given to several emancipists, eight marines and two crew of HMS Sirius, on the northern bank of the Parramatta River at Rydalmere and Ermington. By about 1800 \"The Ponds\" became known as \"Field of Mars\", presumably because of Mars being the god of war, and the military men that received land grants there. The parish of Field of Mars spread more or less from Parramatta to West Ryde and up to Carlingford and Eastwood. Later on to the north of this area along the Lane Cove river, a Field of Mars Common of 5000 acres was established. Today's Field of Mars reserve and cemetery are remnants of this common.\nRydalmere was named by Thomas O'Neill when he purchased much of the 600 acres of Hannibal Macarthur's old Vineyard Estate, after it was put up for sale through the trustees by the Catholic church in 1877. Despite the myth surrounding O’Neill coming from England’s Cumbrian Lake District, he was born in Tipperary, Ireland in 1830, and accompanied his parents to Australia as a young lad, where he finished his education.\nHe left for the Californian goldfields in 1849 and returned in 1851, the venture being quite profitable for him. He entered business with much energy and a strong drive which along with sound commercial instincts allowed him to retire a very wealthy man in 1877. Another myth is that O'Neill purchased the Vineyard estate as a speculator in order to quickly sell it and make a healthy profit. The facts don't tend to support this view. After the purchase, he established his \"Fairmount Estate\" which covered a considerable portion of Rydalmere, the boundaries more or less extending from Park Road (formerly Wharf St) to Spurway Street, the southern boundary being the Parramatta river, and the northern boundary being Subiaco Creek (formerly Bishop’s Creek). It was an orchard and pasture property.\n\"Fairmount\" the family home he built, was said to be a very beautiful residence, and splendid views were to be had from its tower. It has long since disappeared and was thought to have been located near Victoria Road and Gammell St. The property sales and sub-divisions only occurred slowly, and appear to be a result of either being required for the advancement of the suburb, or the estate being divided over time by roads being established i.e. Victoria Road in 1886, rather than being sold off for a profit.\nThomas O'Neill died on 13 March 1890 at Fairmount aged 59. His funeral service was held in St Mary's Cathedral, and he was buried in Waverley cemetery. He was said to have been a most amiable man, held in high regard by all that knew him. His was deeply involved in not only Irish and Catholic affairs, but public affairs in general. His charity spanned many years with his support of St Vincent's Hospital, The Good Samaritan Refuge and The Benevolent Asylum being on-going. His purse was never closed to charity. His final act before his illness was to donate the land and money to help the establishment of the Catholic church and school at Rydalmere. \nHe still owned most of his Rydalmere property at the time of his death. Fairmount was later sold by the family and remained an orchard with a few building lots sold. It was not until after WW 2, when the Housing Commission acquired it for public housing, that it was fully developed.\nSo why did he name his property Rydalmere, a lake he probably had never seen?\nWell, he had owned an estate named Rydalmere, which he had sold years before buying the Vineyard estate and must have liked the name which he reused. Exactly where his first Rydalmere property was located is not known.\nRydalmere is a lake in The English Lake District which gains its name from the nearby village of Rydal. Mere is an Old English word meaning \"lake\", or \"body of water\".\n\nThe Darug is the clan name for the indigenous people of the area. The Darug fashioned tools and spears for hunting native animals and collected wild berries and flora as a valuable source of vitamins. The Darug had a close relationship with the river, from which they caught fish, eels, and other food. Their stable bark canoes often carried a small fire in the middle — built on a mound of soil to allow them to cook their catch fresh. 'Firebrand farming' was also practised in the region.\n\nSoon after Governor Phillip's arrival with the First Fleet (of convicts from England) in 1788, Parramatta was developed as a farming settlement to feed the new English colony. This led to the immediate and tragic displacement of local Aborigines from the land they had lived off for thousands of years.\n\nLocal Aboriginal groups led a resistance against the new settlers. The most prominent warrior was Pemulwuy. Once when he tried to spear a soldier in retaliation, he was shot in the head and body. Despite being held in chains in the hospital where he was sent to recover, he managed to escape. In retaliation, the British ordered that any groups of Darug Aborigines be attacked, and a reward was placed on Pemulwuy's head. In 1802 he was shot and killed, and his head was cut off and sent to England. The conflict continued on and off until 1805 when the first recorded act of reconciliation occurred between Indigenous people and the British settlers.\n\nThe introduction of foreign diseases was the most debilitating trend — and many of the Barramatagal clan disappeared in the Small Pox epidemic during early European settlement. However against the odds others survived and their descendants live in the region to this day. In the early 19th century, more positive developments occurred and the region became a meeting place for tribes from surrounding regions. An annual feast was held by Governor Macquarie to encourage Aboriginal people to leave their children at a local school, but this focus later shifted to Blacktown area.\n\nRydalmere has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nRydalmere railway station was located on the former Carlingford line of the Sydney Trains network, which closed on 5 January 2020 for conversion to light rail. The next station to the south was Camellia and to the north was Dundas. A conversion of the Camellia to Carlingford section of the Carlingford railway line to light rail was announced in 2015 as part of the Parramatta Light Rail project. Though originally to run entirely to the south of the Parramatta River, a redesigned second branch of the light rail was announced in 2017. Beginning at Sydney Olympic Park, the line will pass through Rydalmere before joining up with the Carlingford branch at either Rydalmere or Camellia. If the Camellia option is chosen, a new bridge across the river would be constructed between the two suburbs.\n\nRydalmere ferry wharf is on Parramatta River and has services run by the Sydney Ferries network. The next wharf west is at Parramatta and east is Olympic Park, then Meadowbank. The ferry primarily services tourists on weekends and city workers during the week. RiverCat catamaran type ferries work the Parramatta River route due to shallow waters, particularly during low tides.\n\nThere are five Sydney bus routes that service the area: the 520/ travels to and from Parramatta Station to City and Circular Quay. The 523 travels via Spurway and Bartlett Streets in Ermington and on to West Ryde. The 524 services the industrial area of Rydalmere stopping along South Street and then on to the south side of Ermington and Melrose Park. The 525 is a Parramatta Station to Burwood service. All routes travel along Victoria Road at some point and stop at Rydalmere Station.\n\nVictoria Road (A40) is a major route connecting Parramatta with Anzac Bridge and passes through Rydalmere. Silverwater Road is part of the A6 arterial route between Cumberland Highway at Carlingford and Princes Highway at Heathcote. It intersects with Victoria Road at a flyover interchange on the eastern edge of Rydalmere and crosses the Parramatta River over Silverwater Bridge.\n\nIn the 2001 census, for people travelling to work using just one method of transportation from Rydalmere, 54% travelled in a car as the driver, 6% took the train, 5% walked, 4% travelled in a car as passenger, 4% took the bus. Commuting to work via ferry, truck, motorbike, bicycle accounted for only 1% each of the Rydalmere population.\n\nRydalmere currently consists of residential and commercial developments. The western side of Rydalmere is commercial consisting primarily of light manufacturing industry and service industries. The eastern side is mainly residential.\n\nIn 1886 Thomas O’Neill advertised land on the \"Rydalmere\" estate. The subdivision was divided into residential blocks, and was bounded by Victoria and Park Roads, and included Pine, Wattle and Myrtle Streets. The sale was hardly a success, though the corner block of Victoria & Park was sold, with building probably commencing that year, and the hotel license being obtained to allow the opening of the \"Rydalmere Family Hotel\". O’Neill donated the neighboring land to the Catholic Church and school, while the rest of that subdivision appears to have been purchased by Frederick Randall, the Postmaster. It was known as Randall’s Estate and sold some 30 years later.\nThe Rydalmere Hotel has a long if interrupted history. Henry Atkins was the first Licensee, but only held it for a short time before transferring the license to Henry Jenkins in March 1887. Mr. Jenkins wasted no time advertising his hotel in the SMH, with the Saturday 26 March edition extolling the virtues to \"City Gentleman and Families\" of the \"comfort and moderate charges at the RYDALMERE FAMILY HOTEL, which is in every sense a country hotel\". Disaster struck when Sydney was hit by a storm with gale force winds on Friday 23 September 1892, resulting in the hotel being blown down.\nThere was even greater excitement in the district on 9 September 1907, when Constable Howard, senior officer of the Dundas district described how he passed through the scrub near the Rydalmere Hotel shortly after mid-day. He inspected the hotel, where everything appeared ok, but then he heard noises and talk coming from the Catholic Church next-door, indicating illegal drinking taking place. Waiting at the door, he attempted to detain a person as they were leaving, but was dragged into the building where he received a fearful beating and kicking from four men. He drew his revolver and fired, wounding a man. The four men arrested were Thomas Millane (the wounded Licensee of the Rydalmere Hotel), Michael Millane (his brother), Michael Murphy (caretaker of the church) and George Workman.\nThe hotel continued trading with a somewhat dubious reputation and ever changing Licensees until 1929, when it was forced to close due to its license being transferred to a Campsie hotel. In 1949 Millers applied to re-license the Rydalmere hotel by transferring the license of the New Langham Hotel in York Street. The Rydalmere Family Hotel was renovated, and additions made to it, so that it was ready for its official opening on 31 December 1949. It is an unusual design, with the double storey section on the eastern side possibly being the original 1892 building, built after the storm. It had a striking appearance of off white, with the lower section having light blue glazed tiles with black tile trim - a cool colour scheme, which on hot days beckons its customers, and very different to the brown tiles of most pubs at the time.\nDuring the 70s the colour changed, as did the name, to The Family Inn and it became one of Sydney's leading live music venues.\n\nThe shopping centre is located on both sides of Victoria Road at the intersection with Park Road. The northern side was constructed in 1959 and is typical of the era.\nThe original shops consisted of Strange's Four Square Food Store, Davy's Pharmacy, McLeay's Hardware, Lorna Beauty Salon, Bambino Children's & Baby Wear, Rydalmere Fish Supply, Rydalmere Milk Bar and Pat Howard Barber & Tobacconist.\nA weatherboard Post Office building originally stood near the footpath on Victoria Road, but was relocated back near the bank adjacent to the shops in the early 60s.\nThe shops formerly located on the southern side of Victoria Road were built about the same time and belonged originally to the Hellyer family. They are the Newsagency and Grocery/Milk Bar. The end shop nearest Park Road was a Fish Shop/Takeaway that traded for a great many years as The White Rose. The shops were demolished in 2010 to make way for Aldi's new store.\n\nRydalmere lost the beautiful Subiaco in 1961; it was formerly the home of Hannibal Macarthur, owner of the Vineyard Estate. Factories had surrounded the property. Rheem (Aust) acquired and demolished the property in order to extend its factory. The house itself was a great loss, but the convent grounds had become a time capsule and still included Hannibal Macarthur’s original garden and Phillip Schaeffer's earlier house \"Vineyard\" c1791.\nIn contrast and a kilometre or so downstream, International Combustion Australia (ICA) had acquired the old Truganini Park property in 1953, in order to erect its new factory on the corner of South Street and Park Road. The old homestead \"Truganini\" was still in good condition, so ICA preserved it by building their new factory around it, and using it as office space. The factory was sold and demolished and is now a factory unit complex but Truganini is still there thanks to 60 years of careful maintenance by ICA. Although it is a private business premises, its exterior can be viewed during business hours by interested people.\nAnother sad loss was the old original brick school building on Victoria Road, a typical 2 room country schoolhouse of the period. The Minister for Public Instruction opened it with much ceremony on 14 December 1890. On completion of these duties, the official party hurriedly made their way across the road in order to perform a similar duty for the opening of the Rydalmere School of Arts.\nThe old school building had been used as the school library for many years and suffered damage from a fire out of school hours. Being the 1960s, it would be reasonable to suggest that demolition rather than preservation was the first thought that entered the mind of the bureaucrat making the decision. Thankfully the \"Masters House\" built at the same time as the school, and located next-door still exists. It is now a private dwelling.\nAlthough the Ermington-Rydalmere local Council was absorbed into Parramatta Council in 1948, the old Town Hall managed to survive until 1963 before it was demolished. Erected in 1889, it was a hall with a classical style façade and stood near the footpath, facing Victoria Road. What is now John Carver Reserve was the \"Town Hall Green\" so to speak. A little further up the footpath on the eastern side, stood the old wooden \"temporary\" Post Office. It was demolished about 1962 along with the old neighbouring Fire Station.\nAcross the road on the south east side of Park Road, near the corner of Victoria Road stood the old horse trough. It went about the same time. In the 60s, if something was old, and stood still, it was fair game.\n\nThe residential part of Rydalmere is divided by Victoria Road. The northern side has generally higher property prices and less Department of Housing and this is reflected in the more conservative voting pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the 2016 census, Rydalmere recorded a population of 6,642. Of these: \n\nIn the Australian Parliament, Rydalmere falls within the Division of Parramatta, currently represented by Julie Owens, a member of the Australian Labor Party. Owens was elected at the 2004 federal election.\n\nIn the New South Wales Parliament, Rydalmere falls within the Parramatta electorate, currently represented by Geoff Lee, a member of the Liberal Party. Lee was elected to NSW Parliament at the 2011 state election.\n\nRydalmere falls within the Elizabeth Macarthur Ward of the City of Parramatta local government area.\n\n"}

Samuel was a carpenter who had built a house for the father of future Mormon leader Heber C. Kimball. Clarissa was a sister of Mormon stalwart Levi W. Hancock.\n\nThe Algers first moved to Ashtabula, Ohio, and then to Mayfield, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, ten miles southwest of the Mormon settlement at Kirtland. In 1830, Samuel (and apparently Clarissa) were baptized into Mormonism and thus became some of its earliest converts.\n\nIn September 1836, after Fanny had spent some time as a teenage servant in the home of Joseph and Emma Smith, the Algers left Kirtland. Joseph Smith asked Fanny's uncle, Levi Hancock, to conduct her to Missouri, but she accompanied her parents instead. The Algers stopped in Dublin, Wayne County, Indiana, and there Fanny met and, on November 16, 1836, married Solomon Custer, a non-Mormon, listed in various censuses as a grocer, baker, and merchant. Although her parents continued on their way to Nauvoo, Illinois, and eventually Utah Territory, the Custers remained in Indiana. Fanny bore nine children, only two of whom survived her. In 1874, she joined the Universalist church in Dublin. Her funeral was held at the Dublin church after she died at the home of her son in Indianapolis, Indiana, on November 29, 1889.\n\nMany years later, an early acquaintance remembered the young Alger of Kirtland as a \"very nice and comely young woman ... toward whom ... everyone seemed partial for the amiability of her character.\" Her obituary reported that in Indiana she was \"generally beloved by all who knew her and was noted for her benevolence of spirit and generous-heartedness.\"\n\nIn January 1838, some months after the Algers had left Kirtland, Oliver Cowdery—one of the Three Witnesses to the authenticity of the Book of Mormon—wrote to his brother concerning his indignation at Smith's relationship with Alger. Cowdery said he had discussed with Smith the \"dirty, nasty, filthy affair of his and Fanny Alger's ... in which I strictly declared that I had never deserted from the truth in the matter, and as I supposed was admitted by himself.\" As Richard Bushman has noted, Smith \"never denied a relationship with Alger, but insisted it was not adulterous. He wanted it on record that he had never confessed to such a sin.\" The best statement Smith could obtain from Cowdery was an affirmation that Smith had never acknowledged himself to have been guilty of adultery. \"That,\" wrote Bushman, \"was all Joseph wanted: an admission that he had not termed the Alger affair adulterous.\" In April 1838, Mormon leaders meeting as the Far West High Council excommunicated Cowdery, in part because he had \"seemed to insinuate\" that Smith was guilty of adultery.\n\nAt this point, Alger disappeared from the historical record of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, only to have a number of stories about her relationship with Smith arise during the late-19th century. All of these second-hand witnesses, Mormon and non-Mormon, agreed that Smith had married Alger as a plural wife. In his compendium of Smith's plural marriages, Todd Compton discusses this late-nineteenth-century evidence and its differing reliability, concluding that Smith's relationship with Alger, though fleeting, was more than a casual sexual affair and that she was \"one of Joseph Smith's earliest plural wives.\"\n\nNevertheless, historian Lawrence Foster disputed Compton's assumption, arguing that although \"contemporary evidence strongly suggests\" that Smith and Alger engaged in sexual relations, the evidence does not indicate that the relationship was \"viewed either by Smith himself or by his associates at the time as a 'marriage.'\" Foster noted that before Smith's first documented plural marriage to Louisa Beaman in April 1841, Smith's \"earlier sexual relationships \"may\" have been considered marriages, but we lack convincing contemporary evidence supporting such an interpretation.\"\n\nAfter Smith's death, when Alger's brother asked her about her relationship with Smith, she replied, \"That is all a matter of my own. And I have nothing to communicate.\"\n\n\n"}

He served in the United States Navy during World War II and later attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in the 1950s.\n\nColasanto attended Bryant University (now located in Smithfield, Rhode Island) and was a decorated veteran of World War II, during which he served as a coxswain in the United States Navy. Around 1954 he intended to work as an accountant for a company in Saudi Arabia; instead, he attended American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He was of Italian descent.\n\nColasanto was best known for his role as Coach Ernie Pantusso, a character in the television sitcom \"Cheers\"; he also directed episodes of many television series, including \"Hawaii Five-O\", \"Starsky & Hutch\", \"Bonanza\", \"Columbo\", and \"CHiPs\".\nColasanto also appeared in feature films, including \"The Counterfeit Killer\" (1968), \"Fat City\" (1972), and Alfred Hitchcock's \"Family Plot\" (1976).\n\nColasanto was in-demand as an actor and director; in the mid-1970s he was diagnosed with heart disease, which was exacerbated by his alcoholism. After twenty years of alcoholism, he became an active member of Alcoholics Anonymous from March 31, 1976, and became sober in the same year. In the late 1970s he began having difficulty securing directing jobs due to his declining health. His last major film role was a mob boss Tommy Como in \"Raging Bull\" (1980).\n\nColasanto was prepared to retire when the role of Coach Ernie Pantusso was offered to him on \"Cheers\". Coach would become Colasanto's best known role. By the third season of \"Cheers\", Colasanto was suffering from heart disease and declining health. His fellow cast members noticed his weight loss, but Colasanto kept the severity of his illness secret. Shortly after the Christmas holiday in 1984, he was admitted to a local hospital due to water in his lungs. Co-star Ted Danson later said Colasanto had difficulty remembering his lines during production of the season.\n\nWhen Colasanto was released from hospital in the week of January 28 – February 3, 1985, after a two-week stay, his doctor recommended he should not return to work. Although he appeared in the cold opening of the third-season finale episode \"Rescue Me\" (1985), Colasanto's last full episode was \"Cheerio Cheers\" (1985), which was filmed in late November 1984.\n\nColasanto died of a heart attack at his home on February 12, 1985, at the age of 61. On February 16, more than three hundred people, including John Ratzenberger, the only cast member of \"Cheers\" to do so, attended his funeral. NBC would not allow the entire cast to take a break from filming to fly to Colasanto's funeral in Providence, Rhode Island. Ratzenberger, a New England native, was sent as a representative for the cast. The cast and crew held a memorial for Colasanto on the set in Los Angeles. Colasanto is buried in Saint Ann's Cemetery in Cranston, Rhode Island.\n\nOn April 19, 1985, Colasanto was posthumously awarded the Best Supporting Actor by Viewers for Quality Television, a (now defunct) non-profit organization that determined what was considered high-quality on television.\n\nColasanto's character was written out of the show as also having died. The fourth-season premiere episode, \"Birth, Death, Love and Rice\" (1985), deals with Coach's death and introducing Colasanto's successor Woody Harrelson, who played Woody Boyd. Colasanto hung a picture of Geronimo in his dressing room; after his death it was placed on the wall in the bar of the \"Cheers\" production set in his memory. Near the end of the final episode of \"Cheers\" in 1993, eight years after Colasanto's death, bar owner Sam Malone (Ted Danson) walks over to the picture and straightens it.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1809393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809393", "title": "Adventure into Fear", "text": "Adventure into Fear\n\nAdventure into Fear is an American horror comic book series published by Marvel Comics from cover dates November 1970 through December 1975, for 31 issues. This is its trademarked cover title for all but its first nine issues, though the series is copyrighted in its postal indicia as simply Fear.\n\nThe first nine issues, cover-titled \"Fear\", reprinted science fiction/fantasy and monster stories from the late-1950s and early 1960s \"pre-superhero Marvel\" comics, primarily \"Journey into Mystery\", \"Strange Tales\", \"Tales to Astonish\", and \"Tales of Suspense\". Most were written by Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee and/or Larry Lieber, and generally penciled by Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, or Don Heck, though occasionally by Paul Reinman or Joe Sinnott. Most covers were reprints, though Marie Severin drew the new top half of #4, John Severin the cover of #8, and the team of Gil Kane (penciler) and Frank Giacoia (inker) the covers of #5, 6 and 9.\n\nWith issue #10 (Oct. 1972), the series was retitled \"Adventure into Fear\" (though remained titled \"Fear\" in the indicia) and began featuring new material. Issues #10-19 featured the swamp creature the Man-Thing, continuing from his introduction in the black-and-white comics-magazine \"Savage Tales\" #1 (May 1971). Following a story written by Man-Thing co-creator Gerry Conway, scripting was taken over by Steve Gerber, for whom the feature and eventual comic book series \"The Man-Thing\" would prove a signature work. Through issue #14, a back-up reprint story would be featured, similar to those that appeared in the first nine issues.\n\nThe story in issue #19 (Dec. 1973) introduced Howard the Duck, a cynical, cigar-smoking, anthropomorphic waterfowl — a parody of funny animals — intended as a throwaway character. That plan changed when the duck quickly proved popular, becoming one of Marvel's biggest 1970s characters and a pop-culture phenomenon that would later also get a solo series, as well as a notoriously poorly received feature film produced by George Lucas. Issue #20 was originally supposed to finish this story, but it was published as \"The Man-Thing\" (vol. 1) #1 (Jan. 1974) instead.\n\nMorbius the Living Vampire, introduced in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #101 (Oct. 1971), became the starring feature with \"Adventure into Fear\" #20 (Feb. 1974) and continued through the rest of the run, ending at #31. After a single issue by writer Mike Friedrich and penciler Paul Gulacy, Steve Gerber wrote several issues, in which Morbius went on a picaresque interdimensional journey and fought the Caretakers of Arcturus and was advised by the eyeball-headed character I. Doug Moench and Bill Mantlo followed, successively, as the feature's writers. Its round-robin of artists included Gil Kane, P. Craig Russell, Frank Robbins, George Evans and Don Heck. Back-up reprints shortly resumed in issue #20. Morbius would then receive his own short-lived comic-book series in the 1990s.\n\n"}
{"id": "1809414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809414", "title": "Kansas City Confidential", "text": "Kansas City Confidential\n\nKansas City Confidential is a 1952 American film noir and crime film directed by Phil Karlson starring John Payne and Coleen Gray. The film was released in the United Kingdom as The Secret Four. Karlson and Payne teamed a year later for \"99 River Street\", another film noir, followed by \"Hell's Island\", a film noir in color.\n\nThis film is now in the public domain in home video and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures for theatrical, TV and Internet.\n\nA nameless, ruthless man (Preston Foster) who identifies himself as Mr. Big is timing to the minute the arrival of two trucks. One is an armored car routinely picking up bags containing lots of money from a bank. The other truck delivers to a flower shop next door. The man's timing shows that, for a very few minutes, the schedule of both trucks coincidentally parks them next to each other. He is casing the armored car. He needs a gang to help him rob it. He selects three men for the gang—the addictive gambler Peter Harris (Jack Elam) wanted for murder, gum-chewing thug Boyd Kane (Neville Brand) and the womanizing Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef). When interviewing them, he wears a mask so they cannot identify him. He has selected them because each has a reason for fleeing the US. They will fit perfectly into Mr. Big's complex plan, which appears to be an ordinary robbery but is much more.\n\nPart of his plan involves making an innocent patsy out of the floral truck driver and ex-con Joe Rolfe (John Payne), a look-alike getaway truck that the police will pursue instead of Mr. Big's truck, to buy time to successfully escape the country. The robbery and pursuit go just as Mr. Big has planned. Each wearing a mask so none can identify each other, he and his gang arrive in a look-alike floral truck as Rolfe, unaware, drives away. Big and his gang subdue the armored car guards in four minutes, grab bags containing $1.2 million and flee, knowing that Rolfe's distinctive getaway truck will be mistaken for his. Escaping, Mr. Big gives each gang member a torn king playing card. He tells them, “Hang on to those cards. We'll cut up the money when I think it's had time enough to cool off. I've got everything covered, but in case something does go wrong, and I can't make the payoff myself, the cards will identify you to whoever I send with the money.” When the gang members object, Big tells them, intensely, “You can't even rat on each other because you've never seen each other without those masks. I've made you cop-proof and stoolpigeon-proof and it's going to stay that way. Keep those masks. You'll be wearing them at the payoff.” The mystery man sends the other three to other countries to wait for the final payout.\nAs Mr. Big has planned, the police, brutal, corrupt and somewhat stupid, run down Rolfe and, wrongly concluding that since he's an ex-con he must have been one of the robbers, submit him to third-degree grilling, but he maintains his innocence. Finally, he is released when his alibi checks out and the real getaway truck is found, and the bank's insurance company tells him that, if he should happen to run across the stolen money, they will pay a 25% reward. As he's released, Rolfe, a Bronze Star and Purple Heart-earning former soldier accustomed to hardship, sees that he's lost his job; he's broke and everything he's worked for since he got out of prison is ruined. After three weeks of unemployment and the prime suspect on the pages of every newspaper, he is at the end of his rope. He decides that, with nothing to lose, he will find the criminals and clear his name. Confiding his plan to a bartender friend with ties to the underworld, the friend tells of rumors that gambler Peter Harris, wanted and with no money or way of escape, suddenly has money and has fled the city. Believing Harris must be one of the robbers, Rolfe pursues him to Tijuana and looks for him in illegal gambling joints.\n\nFinding Harris, Rolfe follows him to his hotel room and, finding the mask Harris wore, beats him into revealing the Mexican resort of Barados as the gang's meeting place. He tells Harris, “I'm moving blind, but I got you for a bird dog to point the way as we go along.” At the airport, waiting for the flight to Barados, the police recognize Harris and, thinking he is reaching for a gun, kill him. Rolfe, not sure what to do next, realizes he can impersonate Harris when the airport clerk hands him Harris’ claim checks. In Harris’ luggage, he finds the mask and the torn playing card.\n\nArriving in Barados as Harris, Rolfe meets Kane, whom he identifies as one of the robbers because he chews gum constantly, and Romano, who Rolfe decides is a gang member because he has arrived almost simultaneously at the same time as Kane. Unknown to Rolfe, Mr. Big is there, too. His name is Tim Foster, and a conversation with a friend, Scott the insurance investigator, reveals his reason for the robbery. Foster never intended for the three goons to split the money and get away with their shares. He was planning to spring a trap on them—as though he had solved the robbery himself—and so reclaim his job with the Kansas City police. His plan is to double-cross his gang, turn them and the money in, collect the 25% reward, and get his job back. The conversation reveals that he was a 20-year police captain who was forced to retire prematurely by political opponents.\n\nBut Foster's plan suddenly is skewed when his daughter Helen (Coleen Gray) arrives unexpectedly. She meets Rolfe while registering for a bungalow and takes a liking to him. She's studying law and ready to pass her attorney's exam. She tells her father that, like a courtroom argument, she has presented his case of premature retirement to Kansas City's mayor and the mayor has agreed to reconsider putting Foster back on the force. Foster, seeing his plan threatened, tells Helen he doesn't want to return, but will consider her proposal. She then shocks him by telling that she's met Peter Harris and likes him.\n\nThat night, in a poker game, Rolfe sits in and deliberately drops the torn king card, sarcastically saying, “My good luck piece. Souvenir of the biggest pot I ever sat in on.” Kane and Romano react, but Foster does not, because only he knows that the man pretending to be Harris, isn't. Rolfe catches Romano searching his room and, after Rolfe beats him and he submits, the two men identify each other as gang members and agree to cooperate until the money is split.\n\nIn the meantime, Rolfe has met Helen and likes her. They tease each other, with Helen threatening to cross-examine him because he will not tell her much about himself. Later, Rolfe meets Foster and tells him he can't join the poker game because he's taking Helen to dinner. Returning to his room, he's beaten by Romano and Kane, who reveals he knows Rolfe is an impostor because he and the real Harris were in prison together. They are about to take Rolfe into the jungle to torture and possibly kill him when Helen knocks on the door and saves him. Later, Foster appeals to Helen to forget Rolfe, but she refuses.\n\nFoster is now ready to carry out the double-cross. He writes individual notes to Rolfe, Kane, and Romano to meet him on his boat, the \"Mañana\", where the three will all coincidentally be, ripe for pickup by the police. Before that can happen, Kane and Romano try to ambush Rolfe, who gets the drop on them, admits he's Rolfe, not Harris, and makes them believe he's after Harris’ share. At the same time, Helen tells her father she knows Rolfe is in trouble. Once again, he fails to persuade her to stop seeing Rolfe.\n\nKane and Romano are not finished with Rolfe. They waylay Rolfe and discover he's going to the boat. All three are driven there by Foster, who they still don't know is Mr. Big. On board the boat, Rolfe escapes and finds the stolen money in a cabinet. Romano, gun in hand, confronts him. Rolfe shows him where the money is. Romano, greedy, kills Kane and is ready to take all the money and kill Rolfe, but Foster, trying to save his unraveling plan, intervenes. But he slips and reveals he is Mr. Big. In a resulting gun battle, Foster kills Romano but not before Romano shoots him. As Foster is dying, he tells Rolfe his one wish is that Helen doesn't find out his duplicity. With his dying breath, he tells insurance investigator Scott that Rolfe deserves the 25% reward of $300,000.\n\nRolfe and Helen comfort each other after her father's death. Later, Rolfe asks investigator Scott how she's taking it. Scott gestures at Helen and says meaningfully to Rolfe, “Why don’t you ask her?” Helen smiles in emotional release, and they kiss.\n\n\"Kansas City Confidential\" was the only film made by Edward Small's short-lived Associated Players and Producers, a company formed by Small, Sol Lesser and Sam Briskin. It was the first of a 13-movie deal Small signed with United Artists in 1952, with ten to be made in the first year. John Payne said he owned 25% of the film.\n\nThe movie originally was called \"Kansas City 117\", the title based on a police code. Small bought the title \"Kansas City Confidential\" off John Gait and Lee Montgomery. It was the first contemporary crime drama Small made after a series of swashbucklers.\n\nFilming started June 4, 1952, and was partly shot on Santa Catalina Island, California, which stood in for Mexico.\n\nThe story begins in Kansas City, but most of the film actually takes place at a fictitious fishing resort in Mexico. \"Kansas City Confidential\" was director Karlson's second crime film; he also directed \"Scandal Sheet\", also released in 1952, which proved to be a modest commercial success. Karlson was \"a gifted filmmaker who had recently graduated from the Poverty Row studio Monogram\"; the film starred John Payne, a \"popular singer of the 1940s who some say was working his way down from Technicolor musicals at 20th Century Fox\" but after his Fox contract expired produced several of his own films.\n\nThe plot served as inspiration for Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\".\n\nThe film was popular enough to usher in a series of \"confidential\" films from Edward Small: \"New York Confidential\", \"Chicago Confidential\", and \"Hong Kong Confidential\".\n\n\"Variety\" wrote \"With exception of the \"denouement\", director Phil Karlson reins his cast in a grim atmosphere that develops momentum through succeeding reels. Payne delivers an impressive portrayal of an unrelenting outsider who cracks the ring. \"Time\" magazine said the film \"combines a 'perfect crime' plot with some fair-to-middling moviemaking ... Obviously, the 'confidential' of the title does not refer to the picture's plot, which is a very model of transparency.\" Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" was not a fan, writing that \"Kansas City Confidential\" \"appears designed—not too adroitly—just to stimulate the curious and the cruel. The screen play by George Bruce and Harry Essex is an illogical fable of crime, the direction by Phil Karlson is routine and the leading role is bluntly acted by John Payne. Neville Brand, Jack Elam and Preston Foster do not shine in other roles, except as drab exponents of the violence that suffuses and corrupts this measly film.\"\n\nWhen the film was released in DVD format in 2002, film critic Gary Johnson said, \"This is prime Karlson. It's brutal, hard-edged, and unflinching, but it's also livened by a distinct streak of optimism. Whereas some directors of film noir preferred the deterministic pessimism of \"Out of the Past\" and \"Raw Deal\", Karlson tempered the surface cynicism of his films with an underlying sense of hope.\" Dave Kehr of \"The New York Times\" gave MGM Home Entertainment's 2007 DVD release of the film an extensive review. He called the release an \"immeasurable improvement over what had been available\":\n\nAs the film in is the public domain, there are innumerable releases with poor quality transfers from worn theatrical prints. In addition to many DVDs of poor to average quality, there are Blu-rays from Film Chest and HD Cinema Classics in the US, and Rimini Editions in France. However, these too only have fair to average quality transfers and are still superseded by the US DVD from MGM, holders of the only high quality, original vault materials on the film.\n\nIn a 1975 episode of the television series \"M*A*S*H\", titled \"The Gun\", the showing of this film is announced over the intercom in the operating room, although the film had already been shown numerous times in the camp.\n\n\n"}

He studied law and political science in Berlin. In 1975, he became involved with the anti-nuclear power movement in southwestern Germany and in succeeding years edited environmental magazines. In 1978, he was one of the co-founders of a regional predecessor to the Green party in Berlin, and campaigned for the European parliament in 1979. \n\nIn the elections of 1983, Vogt was elected to the Bundestag, but resigned two years later because of the then prevailing Green rules of \"rotation\", which specified that legislators should share their terms with others, rather than serving out a full term. He was succeeded by Willi Tatge, and assumed the post of Rhineland-Palatainate party chair for two years (1986–1987). In the following legislative period, he served as a legislative aide to the Green caucus of the Bundestag. He was also a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe between 1983 and 1985. \n\nAfter the reunification of Germany, Vogt was hired by the \"traffic light coalition\" government of Brandenburg (consisting of the \"red\" (SPD), \"yellow\" (FDP), and \"green\" (Alliance 90/The Greens) parties) to oversee the process of \"conversion\" — the transition of local economies that had been based on supporting Soviet military bases to a civilian economy.

One of them, founded by Jean Raibaut, was formally organized under the name \"Club Charly's\" in 1950. The contest organized by Endemol traces its roots to a contest run by an informal group led by Guy Rinaldo and Louis de Fontenay that called itself \"Comité Miss France\" and crowned its first winner in 1947. After the commencement of the Miss World contest in 1951 and the Miss Universe contest in 1952, the \"Comité Miss France\" formally organized in 1954, with Rinaldo as president, under the name \"Comité Miss France – Miss Europe – Miss Universe.\"\n\nIn these early days, however, the organizers of the global contests did not necessarily have entrants who had won what might be considered the corresponding national contest. The entrant for Miss Universe 1953 from France, for instance, was Christiane Martel, who had won the Miss Cinémonde contest, also organized by Rinaldo, and not Sylviane Carpentier, who had won the Miss France contest. Similarly, the entrant for Miss World 1953 was Denise Perrier. As a result, even though France won both the Miss World and Miss Universe contests in 1953, two different women were the winners, and neither was the winner of the Miss France contest.\n\nThe administrative secretary of the \"Comité Miss France – Miss Europe – Miss Universe\" was Geneviève Mulmann, who along with Louis de Fontenay ousted Rinaldo on 14 September 1956. Louis and Geneviève subsequently both took the name de Fontenay, presented themselves as a married couple and had two children together, though they never married. Rinaldo formed a rival association called the \"Comité Miss France de Paris\". And \"Club Charly's\" continued to name its own Miss France. Several lawsuits and countersuits ensued.\n\nThe war claimed its first injury in April 1983. The de Fontenay committee had deposed Isabelle Turpault for posing for nude photographs. After Turpault made some disparaging remarks about Geneviève de Fontenay, Turpault alleged that one of the de Fontenay children, Xavier, punched her on the Champs-Élysées.\n\nIn 1986, Geneviève de Fontenay registered the trademark \"Miss France\" with the Institut National de la Propriété Intellectuelle (INPI), and defended it from a challenge by the Rinaldo committee. She renewed the trademark in 1996.\n\nIn 1999, Eric Morley, founder and organizer of the Miss World contest, revoked the license of the de Fontenay committee and awarded it to the Rinaldo committee, headed by Antoine de Villejoie after Rinaldo's death in 1991. The license was subsequently awarded to Endemol, and starting in 2005 the winner of the Endemol contest or her designated replacement has participated in Miss World.\n\nIn the early years of the Miss Universe, Miss World and Miss International contests, it was rare for the winner of the Miss France contest to compete in both (see table below). From 1961 to 1993, however, the winner of Miss France, or her runner-up, generally competed in international pageantry.\n\nIn 1971, the Miss France winner, Myriam Stocco, competed in both the Miss World and Miss Universe contests. From then until 1993, 17 of the 23 Miss France winners competed in both global contests.\n\nStarting in 1994, the de Fontenay committee stopped sending the winner or runner-up to Miss World, a situation that led to the shift of the license to the Rinaldo committee in 1999. Since 2005, however, the entrant in both global contests has been the winner of the Miss France contest organized by Endemol or her designated replacement.\n\nNowadays, Miss France Organization sends the country's representative to: Miss Universe and Miss World contests. If the reigning Miss France is unable to participate in one of the two contests, it is usually her \"première dauphine\" (first runner-up) that represents France in the one that she doesn't take part in. However, it is not unusual that one of her other \"dauphines\" or even her Miss France predecessor can potentially take that vacant spot.\n\n^ \"Resigned\"\n\nFrance has been represented in the Big Four international beauty pageants, the four major international beauty pageants for women. These are Miss Universe, Miss World, and Miss International and ever sent two delegates to Miss Earth.\n\nThe Boldface indicates winner of the Miss World or Miss Universe pageant : France has two Miss Universe (1953, 2016), one Miss World (1953) and one Miss International (1976).\n\n\n\nThe title has been declared vacant on several occasions, with the runner-up generally fulfilling the term of the winner.\n\n"}
{"id": "1809458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809458", "title": "The Reflecting Skin", "text": "The Reflecting Skin\n\nThe Reflecting Skin is a 1990 British-Canadian dramatic horror film written and directed by Philip Ridley and starring Jeremy Cooper, Viggo Mortensen and Lindsay Duncan. Described by its director as a \"mythical interpretation\" of childhood, the film weaves elements of vampirism, Surrealism, black comedy, symbolism, and religious zealotry throughout its narrative about the perceptions and fantasies of an impressionable young boy in 1950s America. The film places the majority of its action outdoors around the dilapidated farms and in the wheat fields of Idaho shot in idyllic sunlight which belies the dark secrets of the characters and plot.\n\nEight-year-old Seth Dove (Jeremy Cooper) lives in an isolated American prairie community in the 1950s. The film opens with Seth and his friends, Eben and Kim, playing with a frog Seth has found in the fields. The boys inflate the frog by inserting a reed up its anus and leave it by the side of the road. When a local English widow, Dolphin Blue (Lindsay Duncan), stops to inspect it, Seth shoots the inflated frog with a slingshot, causing it to explode over Dolphin.\n\nSeth retreats back to the small gas station where he lives with his overworked, harsh, longing mother Ruth (Sheila Moore) and shy, closeted, detached father Luke (Duncan Fraser). Seth's older brother, Cameron (Viggo Mortensen), is away on military service in the Pacific (Ruth refers to them as \"the pretty islands\"). Seth serves gas to a mysterious group of young men driving a black Cadillac, who promise to see him again soon and drive off.\n\nSeth is sent to Dolphin's house to apologise for the frog prank. Dolphin is haunted by the memory of her dead husband, who hanged himself for unknown reasons a week after their wedding. Surrounded by artifacts from her husband's family's whaling past, Seth takes some of her self-pitying remarks (she claims to be \"two hundred years old\") literally, and after learning about vampires from his father, who is reading a novel on that theme, Seth surmises that Dolphin must be a vampire.\n\nAfter Eben goes missing, Seth and Kim go to Dolphin's house to investigate, because Seth believes she is responsible for Eben's disappearance. The boys excitedly demolish Dolphin's bedroom belongings, and run from the house screaming after spying on her masturbating. Seth runs home, and later finds Eben's dead body floating in the water cistern. The local authorities believe Luke is responsible, because of a homosexual indiscretion years previously; believing himself to be doomed, Luke douses himself with gasoline and incinerates himself.\n\nCameron returns home to look after Seth, as Ruth has become shell-shocked following Luke's death. Whilst visiting his grave, Cameron meets Dolphin, and romance sparks between the two, much to Seth's horror. In a nearby barn, Seth and Kim discover an ossified dead fetus, which Seth takes home with him, believing it to be Eben incarnate as a fallen angel. The next day, Seth follows Cameron to Dolphin's house, where he observes Cameron emotionally confessing to Dolphin his culpability in atomic bomb experiments. Cameron and Dolphin begin to make love; running in terror from the house, Seth witnesses the men in the Cadillac abducting Kim.\n\nCameron's body begins to deteriorate from radiation sickness, which Seth attributes to Dolphin's supposed vampirism. Kim's body is discovered the next day, and law enforcement authorities still believe that Luke is alive and responsible. As Cameron and Dolphin grow closer and plot to run away together, Seth focuses his rage at Dolphin. After consulting with the fetus \"angel Eben\" that night and on the spur of the moment the next day, he does not warn Dolphin of the men in the black Cadillac. Dolphin's body is found, and Cameron breaks down in front of Seth. Realising that he will never get his brother back now, Seth runs to a nearby field and, overwhelmed with anger, screams at the setting sun.\n\nPhilip Ridley was inspired to write the screenplay for \"The Reflecting Skin\" after completing a sequence of artworks titled \"American Gothic\" whilst studying at St Martin's School of Art. \"I read a lot of American literature when I was a child growing up and saw a lot of American films so what I did, particularly in \"The Reflecting Skin\", is that I created a fabulous child-eyed view of what I imagined America to be like – it's a kind of mythical once upon a time never-world, where guys look like Marlon Brando and Elvis Presley, and everything is set in a Wheatfield and it all looks very American gothic.\" Upon directing two short films (\"Visiting Mr. Beak\" and \"The Universe of Dermot Finn\") and completing the screenplay for \"The Krays\" (directed by Peter Medak), Ridley received $1.5 million of funding from the BBC, British Screen and Zenith Productions to shoot \"The Reflecting Skin\" in Crossfield, Alberta, Canada.\n\nIn collaboration with director of photography Dick Pope, Ridley channelled his artistic influences (including Andrew Wyeth and Edward Hopper) to create a hyper-realised vision of a \"mythical, hallucinogenic summer in the life of a child.\" This extended to Ridley personally spray-painting the wheatfields a brighter shade of yellow, and shooting exterior scenes at ‘magic hour’, \"when the sun was at its most intense and golden.\" The film also features Viggo Mortensen in one of his first starring roles.\n\nThe film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 1990, where the critics declared it \"déjà un culte\" (\"already a cult\") before they’d even left the auditorium. The word of mouth about the film, particularly the notorious ‘exploding frog’ opening, was so intense that extra screenings had to be scheduled in order to cater to demand. It went on to win 11 international awards at other film festivals and was picked up for distribution in the US by the then-fledgling Miramax.\n\nAlthough some critics were outraged by the film's \"abnormal situations and morbid characters\", among the more prominent admirers of the film was Roger Ebert, who said it \"reminded me of \"Blue Velvet\" and the other works of David Lynch, but I think it’s better… it’s not really about America at all, it’s about nightmares, and I’m not easily going to forget it.\" Writing for \"Rolling Stone\", Peter Travers wrote that \"Ridley is a visionary, and his haunting film, luminously shot by Dick Pope, exerts a hypnotic pull.\" Kevin Thomas in the \"LA Times\" called it \"an amazing film, studded with selfless, luminous performances and shot through with dark humor, that risks sheer over-the-top outrageousness at every turn but is so simultaneously inspired and controlled that it gets away with everything.\"\n\nThe film has been reappraised in recent years as \"one of the essential art film/horror hybrids from the past few decades.\" Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 83%, based on , with a rating average of 6.5/10. Reviewing the 2015 restoration for Twitchfilm, Jason Gorber described it as a \"strange, at times wonderful film, one that leaves more questions open than answers. Its palate and performances collide in ways that seem unique decades on.\" Writing for \"The Guardian\", Rowan Righelato described it as \"stunningly beautiful… a gothic masterpiece that is often strangely overlooked.\" Reviewing the special edition Blu-ray on BBC News, Mark Kermode said \"Philip Ridley is an extraordinary filmmaker... A really strange, interesting, disturbing, weird piece of work that has found its audience over the years. That's what a proper cult film looks like.\"\n\nAt the 1990 Locarno International Film Festival, Ridley won three awards, C.I.C.A.E. Award, the FIPRESCI Prize, and Silver Leopard. At the 1990 Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival, Lindsay Duncan won the Best Actress award and Dick Pope the award for Best Cinematography. At the 1990 Stockholm Film Festival, Ridley received the FIPRESCI Prize.\n\nThe film was unavailable on home video for many years following its initial VHS release in the UK or USA.\n\nA widescreen DVD was released in Japan in 2005, but quickly went out of print, leaving only a poor-quality German Blu-ray and a fullframe American DVD release from Echo Bridge Entertainment as the only available releases for many years.\n\nIn 2015, UK distributor Soda Pictures announced would release the film in a limited Blu-ray Steelbook edition on November 30, 2015, featuring a new director-approved HD remaster, director's commentary, two new documentaries, Philip Ridley's early short films (\"Visiting Mr. Beak\" and \"The Universe of Dermot Finn\") as well as a personally signed art card of his painting \"Fetal Blossom\" which was one of the artworks that inspired the film. The distributor later released a standard edition Blu-ray and DVD of the film on 14 March 2016, containing all the features of the limited edition except for the signed art card or steelbook packaging.\n\nIn 2016, the director-approved remaster of the film was released on BFI Player, where it is available for online streaming.\n\nElements of the film have been referenced and used in a number of other artistic works, particularly in music. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1809480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809480", "title": "Stanley v. Georgia", "text": "Stanley v. Georgia\n\nStanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969), was a United States Supreme Court decision that helped to establish an implied \"right to privacy\" in U.S. law, in the form of mere possession of obscene materials.\n\nThe Georgia home of Robert Eli Stanley, a suspected and previously convicted bookmaker, was searched by police with a federal warrant to seize betting paraphernalia. They found none, but instead seized three reels of pornographic material from a desk drawer in an upstairs bedroom, and later charged Mr. Stanley with the possession of obscene materials, a crime under Georgia law. The conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Georgia.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States, however, per Justice Marshall, unanimously overturned the earlier decision and invalidated all state laws that forbade the private possession of materials judged obscene, on the grounds of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Justices Stewart, Brennan, and White, contributed a joint concurring opinion. Justice Hugo Black also concurred, with a separate opinion having to do with the Fourth Amendment search and seizure provision. The case also established an implied right to pornography. \n\nThe right to privacy to pornography is not absolute, however. For example, in \"Osborne v. Ohio\" (1990) the Supreme Court upheld a law which criminalized the mere possession of child pornography.\n\nPrior to the \"Stanley\" case, the prevailing precedent was that of \"Roth v. United States\", where obscene material was determined to be unprotected by the First Amendment right to speech. In \"Roth\", the defendant sent lewd advertisements by mail and sold \"American Aphrodite\", a magazine containing erotica and pornography. A California court convicted him under state law, and when Roth appealed the decision, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction. In the majority decision, written by Justice Brennan, a new test was created for determining what can be considered obscene (the Hicklin test was used since a ruling in 1857, which the Court abandoned in \"Roth\"). By 1960, the sexual revolution was in full swing in the United States, and newly defined social norms clashed with the established statutory and common law of the country. Since the ruling in \"Roth\" in 1957, many cases in state and federal courts were determined using the case as primary justification.\n\nRobert Eli Stanley was a Georgia resident suspected, with probable cause, of bookmaking. A warrant was granted to search his home. The searching officials did not find evidence of bookmaking, but instead discovered three reels of eight-millimeter film. They watched the films using a projector that they found in Stanley's home, and upon discovering that the films were pornographic, they seized the films as evidence and arrested Robert Stanley for possession of obscene matter, which was illegal by Georgia statute. Stanley was tried and convicted. He appealed the conviction, and the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the conviction.\n\nThe majority opinion was written by Justice Thurgood Marshall, joined by Chief Justice Warren, Justice Douglas, Justice Harlan, and Justice Fortas. It was a unanimous 9–0 decision.\n\nAlthough the defendant presented multiple arguments in his defense, the Court was able to reverse Georgia's decision using just one of them. A distinction was drawn by the Court between public display and private possession of obscenity. Neither \"Roth\" nor any other case at the time set a precedent for private possession of obscenity. The Court thus decided to set precedent on this issue in this case. \"Roth\" dealt with the mailing and advertising of obscenity. A companion case, \"Alberts v. California\", involved the advertising and sale of obscene materials. All earlier cases were decided with the negative externality of obscenity in mind. They reasoned that members of the public, especially impressionable children, should have a valid expectation to not be inadvertently exposed to obscenity. Public display of obscenity was deemed an \"important interest\" in \"Roth\". Private possession was not as interesting in the eyes of the Court.\n\nThe First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech. In \"Winters v. New York\", a notion was established that freedom of speech extended to what an individual possesses and chooses to read. \"The Constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas, regardless of their social worth\". For this reason, the Court dismissed Georgia's argument that drew a line between communication of ideas and \"mere entertainment\". Marshall noted that such a line could not be objectively drawn.\n\nThe Court reasoned that the Georgia decision encroached on Stanley's pursuit of happiness. Stanley should have a right to define his own spiritual nature. An individual's First Amendment rights must always be protected, unless there is cause to believe that a certain type of expression may cause significant public harm.\n\nThe Court dismissed Georgia in claiming that possession of obscenity necessarily led to \"deviant sexual behavior\" and \"crimes of sexual violence\", as there was little empirical evidence supporting the claim. The Court reasoned that primary crime deterrents should be education and punitive measures for violation of the law. Punishment for an act solely as a preventative measure to ensure that another law would not be violated was discouraged. Georgia also claimed that the possession of obscenity was indistinguishable from its distribution. They claimed that it would be impossible to effectively control distribution if possession was permissible. The Court did not agree with the validity of this claim, and further asserted that an individual's First Amendment rights were more important in this case.\n\nBy the First Amendment, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth, private possession of obscenity was decided to be legal. The Court noted that this does not affect or change \"Roth\" or other cases that deal with public obscenity.\n\nJustice Stewart wrote a concurrence, which Justice Brennan and Justice White joined.\n\nThere was also another issue with the Constitutionality of the case, which was not addressed in the majority decision. The films were seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment as applied to the states by the Fourteenth. The Fourth Amendment prohibits the issuance of general warrants to search a person's home. A warrant can only be issued by a judge when there is probable cause. The particular items to be found must be enumerated on the warrant. The search warrant issued was for the seizure of materials in Stanley's home relating to bookmaking. There was no mention of obscene films on the warrant, and so the seizure of the films as evidence was unconstitutional.\n\nGeneral searches and seizures were made unconstitutional because of the prevailing policy during colonial rule of issuing writs of assistance of the British Crown to search all of a person's belongings to find anything that is incriminating.\n\nThe films and their content were not in “plain view”. The record showed that the officers had to play the films on a projector to determine that they violated the Georgia obscenity statute. So the films are not admissible as evidence under the plain view doctrine, which requires that the character of the object is “immediately apparent”.\n\nA search warrant cannot be used as a “ticket” to enter private property. Once inside, an officer cannot assume the privileges of a general warrant.\n\nFor these reasons, the films are inadmissible as evidence. Stanley made a motion to exercise this Fourth Amendment right during his trial, and the motion was unconstitutionally denied. The Georgia Supreme Court also overlooked this Constitutional violation. The conviction must be reversed.\n\n\"Stanley v. Georgia\" limited the power of the government to police the private possession of obscenity. The majority opinion defended the free and unimpeded acquisition of facts and knowledge, regardless of their apparent social value. The Court reasoned that unless the pornography is presented in a way that creates a negative externality on others, especially minors (\"Roth\"), no individual can be stopped from owning and viewing pornography in private.\n\n\n\n"}

He had been imprisoned as a young man in Austria-Hungary because of his political activities, but made his way to London. There he met anarchist Emma Goldman on a lecture tour from the United States. She befriended him and he immigrated to the US.\n\nHe settled in Greenwich Village, New York, a center of radicals, artists and writers. He declared the neighborhood to be \"a spiritual zone of mind\". For a time he and his wife ran a restaurant in the village. He also edited radical journals. He was close friends with Emma Goldman, and also became friends with playwright Eugene O'Neill, and various others in the artistic circles.\n\nBorn and raised in what is now the Czech Republic and was then part of Austria-Hungary, Havel became involved in the anarchist movement as a young man. In his youth, he was imprisoned by empire authorities in Austria-Hungary for anarchist activities. At the time, he was declared as \"criminally insane\", but he was declared sane by the intervention of Richard von Krafft-Ebing, a noted Austro-German psychiatrist. As a result, Havel was transferred from the prison madhouse to an ordinary prison and the general population.\n\nHe managed to flee to London. There in November 1899, he met the American anarchist and activist Emma Goldman, who was on a lecture tour. They traveled together to Paris, France, where he helped her with preparations for the September 1900 International Anti-Parliamentary Congress.\n\nHavel traveled with Goldman from Europe to the United States, entering as an immigrant, and settled in Chicago. For a time he shared a residence with her, and Mary and Abe Isaak, an anarchist couple, and their family. In September 1901 Goldman, Havel, Isaak, and ten other anarchists were arrested as suspects in connection with Leon Czolgosz's assassination of President William McKinley. Czolgosz had said he was inspired by a speech of Goldman's. Although he insisted she had no direct involvement in his action, Goldman was held by police for two weeks. Havel and the other anarchists were released earlier. The assassination generated considerable anti-anarchist reaction politically, and most anarchists disavowed Czolgosz's actions.\n\nHavel worked for a time in Chicago as the editor of several anarchist publications, including the Chicago \"Arbeiter Zeitung\", published in German. He later worked as editor on \"The Revolutionary Almanac\" (1914), and \"Revolt\" (1916). Sometime in the early 1900s, both he and Goldman moved to New York, where they lived in Greenwich Village, a center of radical politics, and artists and writers.\n\nThere Havel married Polly Holliday, an anarchist who with him ran a restaurant on Washington Square in Greenwich Village. It was frequented by radicals, artists and writers. Havel may also have been Goldman's lover even after his marriage to Polly. In the late 1910s, Havel took in Berenice Abbott as his adopted daughter. She became a noted photographer.\n\nHavel wrote a biography of Emma Goldman and an introductory essay to her collected \"Anarchism and Other Essays\" (1910). He also contributed dozens of articles and essays to anarchist journals, including Goldman's \"Mother Earth\". His essay, \"What Is Anarchism?\" was published also in 1932. A collection of his writings was published for the first time in 2018.\n\nHavel became friends in this period with playwright Eugene O'Neill. The writer based the character Hugo Kalmar in \"The Iceman Cometh\" on Havel.\n\nThe Yale Hippolytic (or \"The Hippolytic\"), a left-wing student publication at Yale University, is named after Havel, to honor his life of cosmopolitan dissent.\n\n\n\n"}

In his youth he served in the United States Air Force, stationed at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn 1960, Hunsaker was Cassius Clay's (later Muhammad Ali) first opponent in a professional boxing bout. After the fight Hunsaker said, \"Clay was as fast as lightning ... I tried every trick I knew to throw at him off balance but he was just too good\". In a thumbnail profile of the fight the following January, young Cassius was reported as having remarked that Hunsaker's style was far different from what Clay had been exposed to as an amateur and Olympian; the young fighter admitted to nervousness going in, and that Hunsaker's aforementioned pro style, had given him trouble. This respect appears genuine, as it was lasting—in his autobiography, Ali said Hunsaker dealt him one of the hardest body blows he ever took in his career. Ali and Hunsaker became good friends and stayed in touch over the years. Hunsaker said he did not agree with Ali's decision to refuse military service, but praised him as a great humanitarian and athlete.\n\nIn the fight game, Hunsaker was a small heavyweight, perhaps better suited for light-heavy classification (175 lbs. limit); today, he would most likely compete as a cruiserweight (190 lbs. limit). He fought as a boxer-puncher, by his own telling. Hunsaker once appeared on the undercard at Madison Square Garden. Hunsaker ended up with a record of 17 wins with 15 defeats with 8 wins by knockout. \nHis career ended after a boxing-related head injury suffered on April 6, 1962, in Beckley, West Virginia. Rushed to a Beckley hospital, Hunsaker was in a coma for five days during which he underwent two brain operations.\n\nHunsaker served as Fayetteville police chief for 38 years, and was later inducted into the Law Enforcement Hall Of Fame.\n\nHunsaker suffered the physical effects of his last match for the rest of his life. He was 74 when he died on 27 April 2005, having been afflicted with Alzheimer's disease in his last years. His body was buried in Huse Memorial Park cemetery, Fayetteville, West Virginia.\n\nHunsaker was active in the Oak Hill Church of the Nazarene for many years, teaching a Sunday School class for fifth and sixth grade boys. He was three times named Sunday School Teacher of the Year. At the time of his death in 2005 he had been married to wife Patricia for over thirty years. The Fayette Station Bridge carrying County Route 82 over the New River at the bottom of New River Gorge was named after him.\n\n"}

Such a square is a hole for the opponent . In the figure to the right, c4 is an outpost, occupied by White's knight. It cannot be attacked by Black's pawns – there is no pawn on the d- and Black's pawn on the b-file is too far advanced.\n\nOutposts are a favourable position from which to launch an attack, particularly using a knight. It's usually a good idea to post knights on opposite color of the opponent's single bishop, other things being equal. \n\nKnights are most efficient when they are close to the enemy's stronghold. This is because of their short reach, something not true of bishops, rooks and queens. They are also more effective in the centre of the board than on the edges. Therefore, the ideal to be aimed at is an outpost in one of the central (c-, d-, e- or f-) files in an advanced position (e.g. the sixth rank) with a knight. Knowledge of outposts and their effectiveness is crucial in exploiting situations involving an isolated queen's pawn.\n\nOn the other hand, Nimzowitsch argued when the outpost is in one of the flank (a-, b-, g- and h-) files the ideal piece to make use of the outpost is a rook. This is because the rook can put pressure on all the squares along the rank.\n\nBibliography\n"}

Morris; and commissioned on 4 November 1943, Commander John B. Fellows, Jr., in command. She was sunk on 16 June 1945 by a kamikaze aircraft near Okinawa.\n\nFollowing a shakedown cruise to Bermuda in December 1943, \"Twiggs\" operated out of Norfolk as a training ship until 12 May 1944, when she departed Hampton Roads in company with \"Franklin\" (CV-13), \"Cushing\" (DD-797), and \"Richard P. Leary\" (DD-664) and proceeded, via the Panama Canal and San Diego, to Hawaii.\n\nAfter arriving in Pearl Harbor on 6 June 1944, \"Twiggs\" took part in exercises and drills in Hawaiian waters and escorted convoys operating between Oahu and Eniwetok. Throughout most of July, \"Twiggs\" worked out of Eniwetok alternating exercises with escort and radar picket duties. On 19 August, she returned to Pearl Harbor to begin rehearsals for the long-awaited return to the Philippines.\n\nOn 15 September, in preparation for the assault on Leyte, \"Twiggs\" departed Pearl Harbor as a member of Destroyer Squadron 49 (DesRon 49), screening Task Group 79.2 (TG 79.2), Transport Attack Group \"Baker\", which steamed via Eniwetok for Manus in the Admiralty Islands. After final preparations for the impending invasion, she departed Seeadler Harbor on 14 October. Arriving off Leyte on 20 October, \"Twiggs\" helped to provide antiaircraft protection for the transports during the landings. In the following days of heavy enemy air activity, she continued to support the invasion and, on one occasion, rescued a downed flier from \"Petrof Bay\" (CVE-80). \"Twiggs\" departed Leyte on 25 October, steamed via Mios Woendi Island to Manus, and arrived at Seeadler Harbor on 1 November.\n\n\"Twiggs\" next rendezvoused with \"Haraden\" (DD-585) and \"Halligan\" (DD-584) for escort duty among the Palau Islands. Stationed east of Mindanao, she protected convoys on the approaches to Leyte.\n\nOn 10 December, \"Twiggs\" left Kossol Roads, between Peleliu and Angaur, with a task force bound for the occupation of Mindoro Island. Luzon was the key to the liberation of the Philippines, and Mindoro was the first step in the assault on Luzon. From 13 December through the 17th, \"Twiggs\" provided antiaircraft cover for the force as it steamed through Surigao Strait and the Mindoro Sea.\n\nLate in 1944, Japan began organized and concerted use of kamikazes. On 13 December, a Japanese suicide plane crashed into \"Haraden\" (DD-585). \"Twiggs\" aided the severely damaged destroyer, fighting fires and treating casualties. She was then detached from the convoy to guide \"Haraden\", which had lost communications and radar in the engagement, until the battered vessel made visual contact with a tow convoy off Silino Island. \"Twiggs\" then returned to the Mindanao Sea and resumed her duties with the task unit. Army Air Force flights out of Leyte augmented escort protection of the convoy. \"Twiggs\" retired to the Palaus on 20 December.\n\n\"Twiggs\" sortied from Kossol Roads on 1 January 1945 protecting a large task force intended for the invasion of Luzon. In the Sulu and South China Seas, several ships of the convoy were hit by Japanese plane attacks; and, on 4 January 1945, \"Twiggs\" rescued 211 survivors of \"Ommaney Bay\" (CVE-79), destroyed by fire and explosion following an attack by a suicide plane. Raids by both torpedo and kamikaze planes continued as \"Twiggs\" operated northwest of Cape Bolinao in support of the Lingayen assault. After taking on food and ammunition at Mindoro, \"Twiggs\" briefly ran antisubmarine patrol off the entrance of Manganin Bay. Underway on the 21st, she arrived in Ulithi on 25 January for minor repairs and maintenance in preparation for the conquest of the Volcano Islands.\n\n\"Twiggs\" joined the Bombardment Group which sortied from Ulithi on 10 February for rehearsals at Loesip Island. On 16 February, the force arrived off Iwo Jima where \"Twiggs\" quickly began fire support for pre-assault underwater demolition operations off the eastern beaches. She also conducted screening and harassing activities, firing on Japanese shore units and providing illumination. On the 17th, a suicide plane attack on \"Twiggs\" resulted in a close call when the plane, in an obvious attempt to crash into the destroyer, crossed her fantail before hitting the water off her port beam and sinking without exploding. The destroyer continued activities to support American ground forces during the grueling battle for Iwo Jima. On 10 March, she retired toward the Carolines, arriving at Ulithi two days later for rest and replenishment.\n\nOn 25 March 1945, as part of Task Force 54 (TF 54), \"Twiggs\" arrived off Okinawa to take part in the preinvasion bombardment. In addition to antisubmarine and antiaircraft patrols, she supported ground forces with night harassing fire. Suicide planes were very active at this time, as the Japanese desperately defended the island. On 28 April, a day of heavy air activity, a kamikaze splashed close aboard \"Twiggs\" while she was on radar picket duty with Task Group 51. Bomb blast and fragmentation from the splashed airplane and bomb blew in the hull plating between the main and first platform deck causing structural damage. The underwater body was dished in, and the starboard propeller was bent. \"Nestor\" (ARB-6) repaired the damage; and, on 17 May, \"Twiggs\" returned to duty with the gunfire and covering forces off Okinawa.\n\nIn June, the battle for Okinawa was drawing to its close. \"Twiggs\" continued radar picket duties in the western fire support area and supported strikes on Iheya Shima and Iheya-Aguni with pre-landing bombardment and gunfire support. On 16 June, \"Twiggs\" was on radar picket duty off Senaga Shima in the western fire support area. At 20:30, a single, low-flying plane dropped a torpedo which hit \"Twiggs\" on her port side, exploding her number 2 magazine. The plane then circled and completed its kamikaze mission in a suicide crash. The explosion enveloped the destroyer in flame; and, within an hour, she sank. Despite the hazard of exploding ammunition from the blazing \"Twiggs\", 188 survivors were rescued from the oily waters. Among the 152 dead and missing was her commanding officer, Comdr. George Philip Jr. was nearby at the time of the attack. Captain Glenn R. Hartwig, the squadron commander in \"Putnam\", quickly closed with \"Twiggs\". Exploding ammunition made rescue operations hazardous, but of 188 \"Twiggs\" survivors snatched from the sea, \"Putnam\" accounted for 114.\n\n\"Twiggs\" was struck from the Navy list on 11 July 1945; and, in 1957, her hulk was donated to the government of the Ryukyu Islands.\n\n\"Twiggs\" received four battle stars for World War II service.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1809522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809522", "title": "Morbius, the Living Vampire", "text": "Morbius, the Living Vampire\n\nMorbius the Living Vampire, a.k.a. Dr. Michael Morbius, Ph.D., M.D., is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Roy Thomas and originally designed by penciler Gil Kane, the character first appeared as an antagonist in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #101 (Oct. 1971).\n\nDespite his initial status as one of Spider-Man's horror-based rogues, he went on to become a brooding and gritty, albeit heroic and tragically flawed antihero in his own series and other titles. His true identity was former award-winning biochemist named Michael Morbius imbued with pseudo-vampiric superhuman abilities and physical traits stemming from a failed biochemical experiment which was intended to cure his rare blood disorder, as opposed to supernatural means. The rest of his appearances feature his struggles with his non-human vampiric persona, his insatiable lust for human blood and his subsequent efforts to cure his horrific condition, along with his eventual stint as a brutal and nightmarish vigilante.\n\nThe character has appeared in various animated shows and video games. Jared Leto will portray the character in a live-action film adaptation set to be part of Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters.\n\nMorbius debuted in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #101 (cover-dated Oct. 1971) following the February 1971 updating of the comic-book industry's self-censorship board, the Comics Code Authority, that lifted a ban on vampires and certain other supernatural characters. It was the first issue of Marvel Comics' flagship \"Spider-Man\" series written by someone other than character co-creator and editor-in-chief Stan Lee. Lee, busy writing a screenplay for an unproduced science fiction movie, bequeathed the series to his right-hand editor, Roy Thomas. \"We were talking about doing Dracula, but Stan wanted a costumed villain. Other than that, he didn't specify what we should do,\" Thomas said in 2009, adding that part of the character conception came from an unspecified science-fiction film of Thomas' youth, depicting a man turned into a vampire by radiation rather than magic. Thomas said that the name \"Morbius\" was not deliberately taken from the antagonist Doctor Morbius in the movie \"Forbidden Planet\".\n\nThomas and penciler co-creator Gil Kane created the character as a man who is given pseudo-vampiric abilities and traits via scientific rather than supernatural means. Kane based the character's look on that of actor Jack Palance.\n\nA tragic and sympathetic antagonist in his initial two-issue story arc, having acquired his vampiric addiction while researching a cure for his own rare, fatal blood disease, Morbius collided again with Spider-Man and others in \"Marvel Team-Up\" #3–4 (July-Sept. 1972) and the one-shot issue \"Giant-Size Super-Heroes\" #1 (June 1974). Morbius went on to star in \"Vampire Tales\", a black-and-white horror comics magazine published by Marvel's sister company, Curtis Magazines, appearing in all but two of the mature-audience title's 11 issues (Aug. 1973–June 1975). All but the first and last of these were written by Don McGregor, with penciling by Rich Buckler and by Tom Sutton, primarily.\nAfter his first two \"Vampire Tales\" stories, Morbius concurrently became the star of his own feature in Marvel's bimonthly \"Adventure into Fear\" anthology series, beginning with issue #20 (Feb. 1974) and continuing through issue #31 (Dec. 1975), the last issue of that title. These were written, successively, by Mike Friedrich, Steve Gerber (who had written the first Morbius solo story in \"Vampire Tales\" #1), Doug Moench and Bill Mantlo, working with a wide variety of pencilers.\n\nFollowing sporadic guest appearances throughout the next 16 years, Morbius was revived in the 1992 series \"Morbius the Living Vampire\", launched as part of the \"Rise of the Midnight Sons\" crossover story arc in Marvel's supernatural/horror comics. It ran for 32 issues (Sept. 1992–April 1995). These later stories add to his repertoire of powers the ability to hypnotize others and describe his ability to fly as psionic in nature. A one-shot special, tentatively titled \"Spider-Man/Venom/Morbius\" by \"Morbius\" writer Len Kaminski, was scheduled for 1993, but never saw print due to the writer's departure from the series out of disgust with \"Morbius\" penciler Ron Wagner. Wagner felt that Kaminski's stories were too character-driven and Kaminski claimed that Wagner complained about the stories to the editorial staff and left \"snide margin notes in which he made his personal opinion of my plots clear\" (Kaminski would see these notes because he and Wagner worked under the Marvel method), but ignored Kaminski's attempts to get in touch with him so that they could discuss how the comic should be done. Series colorist Gregory Wright stepped in as writer with issue #9 and delivered the bloodshed-heavy stories that Wagner wanted. Despite this, Wagner lasted just six issues longer than Kaminski on the series. Wright stayed with \"Morbius\" through issue #23.\n\nAlongside the core series \"Morbius the Living Vampire\", a reprint series, \"Morbius Revisited\", was published from 1992 to 1993, and featured material originally published in \"Adventure into Fear\" #27-31. Solo stories starring Morbius also appeared in \"Marvel Comics Presents\" #144 (Late Dec. 1993), several issues of the \"Midnight Sons Unlimited\" series (1993–1995), the one-shot \"Strange Tales: Dark Corners\" #1 (May 1998), \"Amazing Fantasy\" vol. 2, #17 (March 2006), and the one-shot \"Legion of Monsters: Morbius\" (Sept. 2007)\n\nOn October 17, 2012, Marvel announced that Morbius would appear in a new comic by writer Joe Keatinge and artist Richard Elson, beginning January 2013.\n\nBorn and raised in Greece by his single mother, Michael Morbius experienced an isolated childhood due to his rare blood condition, which contributed to his ugly and unpleasant-looking appearance. But despite his looks, he was an intellectually-gifted young man who spent his time reading books and, in time, became a highly respected and Nobel Prize-winning biologist who specialized in the field of human and animal biology. While in New York, after escaping from his home country due to his vampiric condition, he attempted to find a cure and to protect his fiancé Martine Bancroft, but he was attacked by the Lizard and defeated when Spider-Man and the Lizard teamed up against him to recover a sample of Morbius' blood in order to cure their own mutated physical conditions before he escaped. The truth behind his horrific condition is that in order to cure himself of an unknown blood disease which was killing him, Morbius, using his past experience as an expert biochemist, had attempted to cure himself of the disease with an experimental treatment involving vampire bat DNA and electroshock therapy. However, he instead became afflicted with a far worse condition called \"pseudo-vampirism\" that mimicked some of the powers and the bloodlust of supernatural vampirism. Morbius now had to drink blood in order to survive and had a strong aversion to light. His bones became hollow and he gained the ability to fly, as well as gaining superhuman strength, speed, and healing abilities. His appearance, already ugly, became hideous—his canine teeth extended into fangs, his nose flattened to appear more like that of a bat's and his skin became chalk-white. He also gained the ability to turn others into similar \"living vampires\" by biting them and drinking their blood, infecting \"them\" with the disease of pseudo-vampirism. People whom Morbius infected with the disease of pseudo-vampirism did not truly die as a result and they could be cured through an antidote to pseudo-vampirism derived from Morbius' blood that Morbius and Martine had created, though that antidote would not work on Morbius himself. They also did not acquire his ability to fly or his healing abilities and any mortal wound could kill them. He later sought a cure for his condition, but battled Spider-Man, the Human Torch, and the original X-Men. He caused John Jameson to again become the Man-Wolf. Alongside the Man-Wolf, he battled Spider-Man again in another attempt at a cure.\n\nMorbius later rescued Amanda Saint from the Demon-Fire Cult and aided her in her quest for her missing parents. He then first encountered the Werewolf (Jack Russell). He battled Reverend Daemond and encountered the Caretakers of Arcturus IV. He visited both the Land Within, the home of the Cat People, and the planet Arcturus IV. He also first encountered Blade the Vampire Slayer. He then first encountered rogue CIA agent Simon Stroud and battled the extra-dimensional demon Helleyes. He and Stroud then battled a large group of other pseudo-vampires that had been created by Morbius, destroying them all. One of them, however, turned Martine into a pseudo-vampire before being destroyed by Morbius, but Morbius and Stroud cured Martine by using the antidote, after which Morbius fled. Alongside the Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze), the Man-Thing, and the Werewolf, he then encountered the Starseed. Morbius then battled the Thing and the Living Eraser, and escaped to Dimension Z. He later returned to Earth and battled Spider-Man again, this time briefly controlled both physically and mentally by an extra-dimensional humanoid android called the Empathoid, which fed on emotions to survive. Spider-Man destroyed the Empathoid (after the android had possessed him) by causing it to overdose on emotions during an exposure at a baseball game in a stadium where he and Morbius had taken their battle, after which both of them left due to the approach of the stadium guards. Morbius then fled and Spider-Man left the Empathoid's body with the Fantastic Four for safekeeping.\n\nHe once again fought Spider-Man, but then he was hit by a lightning strike, which cured him of his pseudo-vampirism and made him human again (he still retained a thirst for blood, however). While cured, he was charged with the crimes he had committed as a pseudo-vampire and was represented by Jennifer Walters, whose dual identity as the She-Hulk was not yet publicly known. Morbius selflessly saved Walters' life and stabilized her erratic transformations into the She-Hulk with a serum that he had created to cure the remnants of his own transformation. He eventually resumed his pseudo-vampiric state and first met Doctor Strange. Alongside Doctor Strange and Brother Voodoo, he battled Marie Laveau and witnessed the resurgence of true vampires. Morbius later battled Spider-Man in the New York sewers.\n\nThe Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch) and Johnny Blaze searched for Morbius to form the Nine and stop Lilith the Mother of All Demons and her children the Lilin from taking over the world. When they found Morbius, the pseudo-vampire believed that they would kill him, but the Ghost Rider and Blaze successfully captured him. Doctor Langford, who supposedly tried to heal Morbius' wounds, was actually trying to kill him and was working for Doctor Paine. He made an unknown mutagenic serum that would prove fatal to Morbius. Unknown to Doctor Langford, Fang, one of Lilith's children, was also trying to kill Morbius by adding his own demonic blood to the serum, which would also be fatal to Morbius. When Doctor Langford injected the serum to Morbius, it did not kill him, but instead it mutated him. Morbius' friend, Jacob, was trying to look inside of him and see what he could do about Morbius' condition. After Martine Bancroft, Morbius' ex-fiancé, found out that Langford was trying to kill him, Langford shot her and she bled to death. Morbius found this out and was enraged to find his ex-fiancé dead. He later avenged the death of Martine Bancroft by killing Langford and took the beaker which contained the serum. The Ghost Rider and Blaze later found out about Morbius' acts of destruction. The Ghost Rider confronted him and would not tolerate Morbius drinking any more innocent blood. Morbius then vowed he would only drink the blood of the guilty. The Ghost Rider accepted the vow, but warned him not to stray from it. Morbius soon became part of the Midnight Sons.\n\nLater, a new faction of vampires tried to destroy Morbius because he had been genetically manipulated to be the perfect weapon. The chest in which he was to be delivered was intercepted by the Kingpin, Blade and Spider-Man, and he attacked all three. Whatever unknown party manipulated him failed; he collapsed after one battle, possibly dying. With his last breath, he warned Spider-Man to beware of his employer, Stuart Ward.\n\nIt was later revealed that Morbius had signed the Superhuman Registration Act and was cooperating with S.H.I.E.L.D. in an effort to capture Blade. He had also presumably survived his genetic manipulation, as Blade was able to distinguish him as the same Morbius who 'took a bite out of [him]' in their previous encounter.\n\nMorbius was next seen as a member of A.R.M.O.R., held captive by the zombie Morbius from the \"Marvel Zombies\" universe. He survived the invasion, killing his zombified counterpart in the process. Shortly after, he formed a new Midnight Sons with Jennifer Kale, Daimon Hellstrom, Jack Russell, and the Man-Thing to contain a zombie outbreak on an isolated island, briefly running afoul of the Hood in the process.\n\nMorbius later helped the Man-Thing re-assemble a decapitated Punisher into a Frankenstein-like monster called FrankenCastle.\n\nDuring \"The Gauntlet\" storyline, Morbius was behind the theft of a vial of Spider-Man's blood. Spider-Man, learning that Morbius was planning to use the blood samples to create a cure for Jack Russell, agreed to help Morbius by giving him more blood.\n\nDuring the \"Origin of the Species\" storyline, Morbius was among the supervillains recruited by Doctor Octopus to secure some items for him.\n\nDuring the events of \"Spider-Island\", it was revealed to the reader that Morbius was the mysterious Number Six working at Horizon Labs. He assisted, in a hazmat suit to protect his identity, in preparing the cure to the spider-powers virus. When Peter Parker tried to investigate the identity of \"Number Six\", he accidentally provoked Morbius—who had been using the cure to try to develop a basis for a cure for his own condition—into a frenzy, prompting the staff at Horizon to step up building security (making it harder for Peter to enter and exit the building as Spider-Man in the future) and also forcing Morbius to leave, where it was revealed that he had been working with the Lizard, presumably trying to find a cure for both of their conditions. It was also revealed that Morbius was a college friend of Max Modell. Using DNA samples from the corpse of Billy Connors, Morbius was able to create a cure that would restore the Lizard to human form, but he failed to recognize that the Lizard had fully destroyed Curt Connors' human persona. They left the Lizard alone in Morbius' lab, allowing the Lizard to release blood into the lab's air supply to provoke the injured Morbius into attacking the other Horizon scientists. This prompted Morbius to flee the lab, with Spider-Man in pursuit. Morbius was captured by Spider-Man and locked up in a cell in the Raft.\n\nWhen Peter Parker (now in Doctor Octopus's dying body) needs some supervillains to help capture Otto Octavius (now in Spider-Man's body), Morbius offers to help, but is rejected. Morbius eventually escapes from the Raft and flees to Brownsville.\n\nAfter some time, he tried to stop some vampires in Barcelona, but got captured by them and locked in a coffin. The vampires wanted to mix their blood with that of Morbius, until he got unintentionally saved by Domino, Diamondback and the Outlaw. After telling them about the vampires' plan, they agree to help him kill King Morbius (a vampire with Morbius' blood). Then after killing him, a vampire hunter tried to kill Morbius, but thanks to Domino, he escaped.\n\nMorbius was later rescued by Agent of Wakanda Wasp from Dracula's Disciples, with assistance from Agents and Man-Wolf. He later informed Janet and Director Okoye on the Vampire Civil War.\n\nMichael Morbius experienced a transformation by electrical shock treatment and chemical ingestion into a pseudo-vampire. As a pseudo-vampire, Morbius does not possess all the powers of a supernatural vampire, nor is he subject to all the traditional limitations and weaknesses thereof. He possesses a variety of superhuman powers, some of which are similar to supernatural vampires within the Marvel Universe, such as superhuman strength and speed, as well as heightened senses including night vision and echolocation. Due to his vampire-like condition, Morbius is forced to ingest fresh blood on a regular basis to sustain his life and vitality. How much blood he requires and how often he has to feed has not been specified in the comics. However, Morbius does not possess any of the mystical vulnerabilities that supernatural vampires are subject to, such as garlic, holy water, crucifixes, or silver. Morbius has a strong aversion to sunlight, thanks to his photo-sensitive skin which allows some protection from major sunburn, in contrast to \"true\" vampires that are incinerated by it, with the result that he can move in daylight, but his powers are diminished and he will stick to the shade if circumstances demand him to be active during the day. Morbius also lacks the shapeshifting and weather-control powers of supernatural vampires and the ability to control the minds of certain animals. Like \"true\" vampires, Morbius does possess the ability to hypnotize beings of lesser willpower and bring them under his control, which can only be resisted by those possessing an extremely strong will. While briefly infected by the demon Bloodthirst, Morbius gained the ability to liquidize his body, moving through small spaces and stretching his limbs as needed. He lost these abilities when he and Bloodthirst split.\n\nMorbius possesses an accelerated healing factor and can recover from mild to moderate injuries at a rate beyond that of ordinary humans. While not nearly as efficient as the healing powers possessed by Wolverine, Morbius has proven to be able to heal from multiple gunshot wounds in less than one hour. More severe injuries, such as broken bones or severe burns, might take several days to heal, but once it was shown to take minutes, even though it left him as a near-mindless creature who must feed to replenish the energy that was used to do so. He is unable to regenerate missing limbs or organs.\n\nMost of Morbius' victims die or are severely injured by his bite. Unlike supernatural vampires, Morbius' victims do not necessarily become pseudo-vampires themselves. There have only been six instances where Morbius' bite has turned other individuals into pseudo-vampires: Jefferson Bolt (a young man first seen in \"Marvel Team-Up\" #3), Emilio (a young man first shown in \"Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man\" #7), Vic Slaughter (a bounty hunter who first appeared in \"Morbius the Living Vampire\" (vol. 2) #7), Nate Grey (in \"X-Man\" #24), Roxy (a junkie dying of a drug overdose in \"Legion of Monsters: Morbius\" #1) and Blade the Vampire-Slayer (in \"Peter Parker: Spider-Man\" #8). The causes behind these transformations have never been clearly explained, even though, in Blade's case, Morbius' bite combined with his unique physiology to turn him into a part-vampire with all the strengths of a traditional vampire and none of the weaknesses.\n\nThe irradiated blood of Spider-Man causes Morbius' vampirism to go into remission. As a result, after drinking Spider-Man's blood, Morbius does not need to feed again for some time. Morbius once developed a serum based on Spider-Man's blood, which would stave off his vampirism for short periods of time.\n\nMorbius possesses the ability of transvection, navigating wind currents and gliding for various distances. In \"Morbius the Living Vampire\" (vol. 2) #2, it was alluded to that this ability may be related to hyper-evolved portions of his brain, caused by a combination of his blood disease and pseudo-vampiric condition.\n\nEven before he contracted the disease of pseudo-vampirism, Michael Morbius already possessed a gifted intellect. He is an expert biologist, biochemist and neuroradiologist with a Ph.D. in biochemistry and a Nobel laureate. He also attended medical school, where he specialized in hematology.\n\nMorbius was first introduced as a villain in the pages of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #101-102. He would return to battle Spider-Man over the years in \"Marvel Team-Up\" #3-4; \"Giant-Size Super-Heroes\" #1; \"Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man\" #6-8 and #38; \"Morbius the Living Vampire\" #3-4 and #21-23; and \"Peter Parker, Spider-Man\" #77-80 and (vol. 2) #8.\n\nSpider-Man and Morbius formed an uneasy alliance during the \"Maximum Carnage\" crossover series.\n\nBlade the Vampire Slayer and Morbius have had an ongoing feud, which began in \"Adventure into Fear\" #24. The two also clashed in \"Marvel Preview\" #8, \"Blade the Vampire Hunter\" #8, \"Blade\" #2–3, and \"Blade\" (vol. 4) #5. Blade, while possessed by a demonic presence, killed Morbius in \"Morbius the Living Vampire\" (vol. 2) #12, but Morbius was resurrected in \"Spirits of Vengeance\" #13.\n\nSimon Stroud, a rogue CIA agent first introduced hunting the Man-Wolf in the pages of \"Creatures on the Loose\", has been hunting Morbius since \"Adventure into Fear\" #27. Stroud and Morbius last clashed in \"Morbius the Living Vampire\" #23.\n\nDr. Loxias Crown was a HYDRA scientist who kidnapped Morbius to study his vampiric condition. During his escape he bit the scientist, turning him into a living vampire like himself who took the name \"Hunger\" \n\nDuring the run of \"Morbius the Living Vampire\", Morbius crossed paths with a handful of brand new foes. They included Vic Slaughter (introduced in issue #7), the Basilisk (Wayne Gifford) (introduced in issue #5), Doctor Paine (introduced in issue #4) and Bloodthirst (introduced in issue #20). During this same period, Morbius also battled a new villain called Bloodbath in \"Midnight Sons Unlimited\" #2.\n\nMorbius has had a friendship with Jack Russell (the Werewolf) since \"West Coast Avengers\" #5, where Morbius helped Russell deal with his werewolf curse. The Werewolf was a frequent guest star in the pages of \"Morbius the Living Vampire\". Morbius and the Werewolf first met as enemies in \"Giant-Size Werewolf\" #4 and, together with the Man-Thing and the Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze), they formed the short-lived Legion of Monsters and met the Starseed in \"Marvel Premiere\" #28.\n\nMorbius and Doctor Strange have teamed up on several occasions. Morbius appeared sporadically throughout the run of \"Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme\", beginning with issue #10. Doctor Strange recruited Morbius as one of \"the Nine\", a.k.a. the Midnight Sons, a team with only one purpose: Earth's last defense against the occult.\n\nIn the \"House of M\" series, Michael Morbius appears in a flashback as one of the scientists (along with Jonas Harrow and Farley Stillwell) that gave Luke Cage his powers.\n\nMorbius appears in \"Dead of Night featuring Werewolf by Night\" #4 as one of the anomalous beings contained and experimented on by the Babylon Group. When Jack Russell attempts to escape from the Babylon Group with his infant daughter, the facility tries to stop him by unleashing Morbius and Frankenstein's Monster. In the ensuing brawl, Morbius' heart is punched out by Frankenstein's Monster.\n\nA zombified version of Morbius appears in the 2008–2009 \"Marvel Zombies 3\" miniseries. The real Morbius of Earth-616 (the mainstream Marvel Universe) is kidnapped and beaten by his zombie counterpart, who found a way from the Marvel Zombies universe into the Marvel Universe. The zombie Morbius holds the real one captive while using a latex mask to look normal. It is revealed that he plans to infect every member of the Fifty State Initiative with the zombie virus. His captivity is later inadvertently uncovered by an A.R.M.O.R. team member, whom Morbius tries to warn of an impending attack. The warning comes too late, as Morbius' zombie counterpart attacks the team member and infects her, thus creating a violent chain of events after she attacks another team member. Towards the end of the crisis, the real Morbius appears out of nowhere and grabs a tree, which he uses as a stake and stabs his zombified version from behind and straight into the heart, killing him instantly.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Morbius is a \"true\" vampire, the son of Dracul and brother of Vlad III Dracula himself. He has all of the powers and abilities associated with the usual interpretation of Dracula. This version of Morbius, however, seems to be heroically struggling against his baser instincts and is in fact a vampire hunter. He meets Spider-Man in a typical misunderstanding, centering on a cabal of vampires attacking Ben Urich. He is really trying to stop Urich from becoming a vampire, which he succeeds in doing despite the conflict. When Spider-Man is bitten by a vampire, Morbius sniffs him and determines that the young superhero is immune to vampirism.\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Geddon\" storyline, there are different versions of Morbius:\n\n\nIn this new universe, Morbius is fused with Morpheus. He tries to steal some blood tanks, but is defeated by Arachknight.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is caused by a direct blow to the dorsal forearm or falling onto flexed wrists, as opposed to a Colles' fracture which occurs as a result of falling onto wrists in extension. Smith's fractures are less common than Colles' fractures.\n\nThe distal fracture fragment is displaced volarly (ventrally), as opposed to a Colles' fracture which the fragment is displaced dorsally. Depending on the severity of the impact, there may be one or many fragments and it may or may not involve the articular surface of the wrist joint.\n\nClassic physical examination findings of a Smith's fracture is palmar displacement of the wrist that results in a \"garden-spade deformity\".\n\nTwo views should be obtained: AP and lateral. \n\nPA radiography will look very similar to a Colles' fracture, with a fracture along the distal metaphysis of the radius (can be shortened or comminuted). Lateral radiography will demonstrate volar angulation / displacement of the fracture. \n\nA commonly used classification of distal radial fractures is the Frykman Classification: \n\n\nTreatment of this fracture depends on the severity of the fracture. An undisplaced fracture may be treated with a cast alone. A fracture with mild angulation and displacement may require closed reduction (putting into place without surgery). Significant angulation and deformity may require an open reduction and internal fixation. An open fracture will always require surgical intervention.\n\nIndications for operative management include dorsal or volar comminution, intra-articular involvement, instability post-reduction, angulation greater than 20 degrees, surface step-off over 2mm or shortening of the radius greater than 5mm. \n\nFor a closed reduction, the approach is the opposite of reductions completed for Colle's fractures. In the case of a Smith's fracture, the wrist must be reduced and splinted in extension.\n\nThe biggest concern is malunion of the wrist due to poor reduction or shortening of the distal radius. This can result in a permanent \"garden-spade deformity\". \n\nThere are also higher risks of carpal tunnel syndrome and osteoarthritis in patients with a previous Smith fractures. \n\nEntrapment of the extensor pollicus longus can also occur in cases of non-union, and can result in late rupture of this tendon. \n\nComplex regional pain syndrome can be reported in up to 40% of fractures.\n\nThis fracture is named after the orthopedic surgeon, Robert William Smith (1807–1873) in his book \"A Treatise on Fractures in the Vicinity of Joints, and on certain forms of Accidents and Congenital Dislocations\" published in 1847.\n\n"}

It was the first Pakistani film to complete 75 weeks in cinemas and, thus, became the first Pakistani (Urdu) \"Platinum Jubilee\" film. The film was picturized in black-and-white prints in Karachi.\n\nThe film tells of a beautiful but underprivileged girl Najma (Zeba) living in Murree with her aunt (Bibbo) and her two daughters Dolly and Seema. One Morning she is told to escort Seema home as she has returned from a trip. When she arrives, a tearful Seema tells her of an affair she had with a man called Sohail. As a result of the affair she had become pregnant, however she abstained from telling Sohail as he had finally found the job of his dreams and was going away to work. So she had the baby, hid the child from the world and awaited Sohail's return. But he never came. She entrusts Najma with the responsibility of taking care of the child and keeping her secret. Najma agrees and takes her home, and she leaves the baby with an old peasant in the hills for safekeeping.\n\nMeanwhile, in Karachi, the son of Seth Khan Bahadur (Zahoor Ahmed), Nasir (Waheed Murad), leads a privileged life and is habitual of going to nightclubs and various parties with his friend Shahid (Nirala). One day, after coming home late from a night club, his father catches him red handed and proceeds to scold him. After this he tells Nasir that his late friend's wife has sent a letter to him proposing marriage for one of her two daughters and Nasir is to leave the next day for Murree. Nasir is reluctant but has no choice so he agrees, however he is given the choice to choose between the two daughters. Nasir takes his friend Shahid along and on the way switches roles with him, thereby exempting himself from marriage.\n\nUpon reaching their destination Shahid and Nasir become acquainted with the family and Shahid, acting as Nasir, immediately takes a liking to Dolly. Nasir (acting as Shahid), however, takes a liking to Najma and the two fall in love.\n\nAfter a while the Shahid and Nasir are told that Seth Khan Bahadur has been invited to Murree to finalize the marriage. Nasir, the real Nasir, comes to the house disguised as his father and successfully fools everyone. However, his real father arrives and exposes the whole truth.\n\nAfter his father has told him off, Nasir tells him of Najma and how the two are in love and she is the perfect person to take as a wife rather than Dolly or Seema. His father, seeing how serious he is, joyfully agrees. However, when his father talks to Najma's aunt, she reacts strangely and says that Najma is not the innocent girl she seems to be. She then calls the old peasant, who Najma left Seema's baby with, into the room carrying Seema's baby. Najma's aunt asks her to put the baby in his mother's arms. She then puts the baby in Najma's arms, and Najma, bound by her promise to Seema, says nothing. Nasir is shocked by this ill news and refuses to accept it. He desperately tries to persuade Najma to deny the accusation. Najma, sworn to secrecy tells Nasir to forget her. Nasir is crushed and leaves in anger.\n\nNasir, returned to Karachi, is overcome with depression and resorts to drinking to forget his sadness. His father worries for him and asks him to marry Seema. In Murree, Seema says no to the marriage but is forced into it by her mother. She ventures to find Najma, who now lives with the old peasant and her nephew. She asks Najma to break her promise, but Najma stands by it and tells her to marry Nasir as it is for the best. Finally Seema agrees.\n\nMeanwhile, in Murree, the nephew of the old peasant tries to force Najma to marry him and in the struggle she apparently kills him. Then she runs away to Karachi with the baby and arrives at Nasir's house.\n\nNasir is infuriated at her arrival and is repulsed because she brought the baby as well. Seema however persuades Nasir to give Najma shelter in their house. This allows her to be close to her baby as well.\n\nMeanwhile, Seema's long gone lover, Sohail returns only to find her married to Nasir. He tries to meet with her but Najma stops him just in time and pleads to him to go back, but doesn't tell him what has happened as she is bound by her promise. Nasir thinks that Sohail is Najma's lover when he sees them talking and falls into another misunderstanding.\n\nSohail however, keeps writing letters to Seema which the household servant gladly takes to Seema every time, hiding them from Nasir. One day however, he is caught red handed. But Nasir is unaware that the letters were meant for Seema and not Najma. He confronts Sohail at his house and questions his relationship with Najma. When Sohail reveals the truth, he is awe struck.\n\nHe confronts Najma and asks her what gave her the right to toy with his emotions and weave this web of lies. He also reveals to Seema's mother who has arrived that Najma had hidden the truth all along and the baby is Seema's. This way she kept away shame from their household. Seema's mother expresses her gratitude to Najma, but tells her to leave because in her midst they would always live in shame. Najma, now dejected by Nasir and completely helpless accepts this.\n\nWhen she leaves, she is found by the old peasants nephew who hadn't died after all. Their chase proceeds to a railway track above a river and both of them fall over. When this news reaches Nasir he is devastated. Meanwhile, amidst all the depression, Seema takes poison and dies as well.\n\nNasir and his family, along with Shahid, travels to Murree where Nasir drowns in depression and becomes an alcoholic. He spends his time in the valleys of Murree where he hallucinates that Najma is present among the trees. One day when Shahid is out on a stroll he sees Najma on crutches, it turns out that the fall from the rail track didn't kill her, but broke her legs. Shahid persuades her to come home with him and marry Nasir who is depressed all the time and also tells her about Seema's death.\n\nBoth of them proceed to Nasir's home, only to find him missing. His father and Seema's mother welcome her with open arms, but tell her that Nasir has left the house without telling anyone and in his condition, he might do something desperate.\n\nNajma rushes to find him trying to commit suicide on the cliffs. She sings to him and asks him to come back. Nasir sees her and the two embrace each other.\n\nThe brilliant soundtrack composed by Sohail Rana contributed enormously to Armaan's success and is considered to be his magnum opus. The soundtrack is perhaps the most memorable in the history of Pakistani cinema and many of the songs are cited as classics in film music. The soundtrack features the voices of Ahmed Rushdi, Mala, Naseema Shaheen and Khursheed Nurali (Sheerazi). Sohail Rana won the prestigious Nigar Award for Best Musician in 1966 for composing the soundtrack and Ahmed Rushdi won the Nigar Award for Best Male Singer in 1966 for singing \"Akele Na Jaana\".\n\n\nArmaan's soundtrack has remained hugely popular amongst Pakistani citizens since its release. The songs, \"Akele Na Jaana\" and \"Ko Ko Koreena\" have gained cult status, so much so that they still continue to be favourites almost 50 years after their release.\n\nArmaan broke several records at the Pakistani Box Office. It became the first \"Platinum Jubilee\" in the history of Pakistani Cinema and ran for 76 weeks. In addition to its commercial success, Armaan won several awards at the Nigar Award ceremony in 1966 including Best Film.\n\nArmaan was remade in 2013 starring Fawad Khan and Aamina Sheikh.\n\nIn total, the film won 6 Nigar awards:\n\n"}
{"id": "1809547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809547", "title": "Cosmobiology", "text": "Cosmobiology\n\nHistorically, the term 'Kosmobiologie' was used by the German medical astrologer Friedrich Feerhow and Swiss statistician Karl Krafft in a more general sense \"to designate that branch of astrology working on scientific foundations and keyed to the natural sciences\". \n\nThe term cosmobiology was popularized in English after the translation of the writings of Reinhold Ebertin, who based a large part of his techniques on the midpoint-astrology work of Alfred Witte The term most frequently refers to the school of astrology founded by Ebertin. The main difference between Witte's Hamburg School and Ebertin's Cosmobiology is that Cosmobiology rejects the hypothetical Trans-Neptunian objects used by the Hamburg School and practitioners of Uranian astrology. Another difference is the significant expansion of Cosmobiology into medical astrology, Dr. Ebertin being a physician.\n\nCosmobiology continued Witte's ultimate primary emphasis on the use of astrological midpoints along with the following 8th-harmonic aspects in the natal chart, which both Witte and Ebertin found to be the most \"potent\" in terms of personal influence: conjunction (0°), semi-square (45°), square (90°), sesquiquadrate (135°), and opposition (180°).\n\nIn cosmobiological analysis, planets are inserted into a special type of horoscope often referred to as a 'Cosmogram' (derived from the Uranian 90° dial chart) and delineated.\n\nThe primary reference/research text for Cosmobiology was first published in 1940 by the German astrologer Reinhold Ebertin. The name of the book is \"The Combination of Stellar Influences\". The original German title is \"Kombination der Gestirneinflüsse\". Its foundations were derived largely from the early versions of the \"Regelwerk für Planetenbilder\" by Alfred Witte, and then further built upon by Ebertin and colleagues.\n\nEbertin defined Cosmobiology as the following:\n\n\"Cosmobiology is a scientific discipline concerned with the possible correlation between the cosmos and organic life and the effects of cosmic rhythms and stellar motion on man, with all his potentials and dispositions, his character and the possible turns of fate; it also researches these correlation and effects as mirrored by earth's plant and animal life as a whole. In this endeavor, Cosmobiology utilises modern-day methods of scientific research, such as statistics, analysis, and computer programming. It is of prime importance, however, in view of the scientific effort expended, not to overlook the macrocosmic and microcosmic interrelations incapable of measurement.\"\n\nWhat is noteworthy about both Cosmobiology and Uranian astrology, which has developed along a different path technically, is their emphasis on critical analysis and testing by observing more clearly measurable or observable astrological correlations, rather than to simply perpetuate observations or assumptions written in historical astrological texts, a problem leading to widespread criticism of mainstream Classical Astrology. Some have speculated that the term \"Cosmobiology\" was coined specifically to divorce its precepts from the manifold ambiguities of, and subsequent widespread biases against, Classical Astrology.\n\nThree prominent published Cosmobiological authors in the English language are German-American cosmobiologist Eleonora Kimmel, American cosmobiologist Aren Ober (formerly Savalan), and Australian cosmobiologist Doris Greaves, all of whom have published texts in Cosmobiology based on their own substantial experiences.\n\n"}

The park is a popular tourist destination; available activities include canoeing, SCUBA diving, kayaking, fishing, camping, hiking, wildlife watching, and swimming. The spring in the Park (Volusia Blue Spring) is the largest on the St. Johns River. Thanks to its relatively warm temperature of , the spring attracts many Florida manatees during the winter months. of water flow out of Blue Spring into the St. Johns River every day.\n\nThe spring was visited by botanist John Bartram in 1766.\n\nThe spring and surrounding land were acquired by the Weismore family in the mid-19th century and a large plantation-style home built upon a shell mound on the property. The area seemed to be excellent for the cultivation of citrus fruit, and a small railway was built linking Orange City to the dock at Blue Spring. Ultimately, the Florida East Coast Railway was constructed not far from the present-day park. A killing freeze occurred in the 1890s, wiping out area citrus groves and driving the industry south. The Thursbys switched to the tourist trade, taking advantage of the beautiful spring and excellent fishing and hunting opportunities along the St. Johns River.\n\nThe park was acquired by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection in 1972 to kick-start its manatee protection program.\n\nResearchers have recorded the life history of individual manatees at Blue Spring since 1978, including births, deaths and relationships. Manatees migrate to warmer spring water during the colder months in Florida, and will often return to the same spring every year. Manatees are identified by their scar patterns, which they acquire mainly from boat strikes, but also from fishing line entanglements, cold lesions, and fungal infections. The research data collected, both in person and through live video streaming, comprises one of the world's longest running and comprehensive manatee databases in existence. Several government agencies partner to maintain a Manatee Individual Photo-Identification System (MIPS) for the Florida manatee. Identifications by State Park rangers and Save the Manatee Club researchers at Blue Spring have contributed a large number of sightings to this database.\n\nThe increasing number of human visitors and also manatees has increased the environmental load on the springs ecosystem. Both humans and manatees are creating water pollution and as a result, more filamentous algae grows in the springs area.\n\nAnother environmental problem is the decrease in the natural water supply to the springs due to the groundwater pumping in the nearby cities. As a result, the output of Volusia Blue Spring has fallen over the last decades.\n\nBlue Spring State Park has fifty-one campsites and six cabins that can be rented. The camping area is pet friendly.\n\nThe spring runs a few miles long and features a boardwalk which stretches 1/3 of a mile from the St. Johns River to the headspring. All water related activities are prohibited during manatee season (mid November–March). Qualified Scuba divers can descend into the spring cave in season. Picnicking is a popular pastime, with multiple pavilions available for groups and scattered picnic tables around the entire park. The park also features volleyball courts and a playground, as well as, canoeing, kayaking, and fishing. The old Thursby plantation house is being maintained and has historical displays that visitors can explore. Various wildlife besides manatees can be seen as well, including alligators, bears, raccoons, and various species of birds. Hontoon Island State Park is a short paddle down the St. Johns River. Foodservice, stores, and a water activity rental station are available for supplies\n\n\n"}

In 2002, he was called \"one of the most powerful and influential figures in the nation\" by \"The Age\".\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Adelaide, Crosby first became involved in politics with the Liberal Party of Australia, eventually being appointed federal director of the party in 1997. He oversaw the party's successful campaigns at the 1996, 1998, 2001, and 2004 federal elections, which made the Howard Government Australia's second-longest serving federal government. In 2002, Crosby left his formal position in the party to establish a consulting firm, the Crosby Textor Group.\n\nCrosby first ventured into overseas politics at the 2005 United Kingdom general election, where he managed the Conservative Party's unsuccessful campaign. He has since also run Conservative campaigns for the 2008 and 2012 London mayoral elections, as well as the 2015 general election, all of which resulted in victories for the party. His campaign was not successful for the 2016 London mayoral election (which was won by the Labour candidate, Sadiq Khan) and the 2017 general election in which the Conservatives remained the largest party but lost 13 seats and their parliamentary majority.\n\nOutside of Australia and the UK, Crosby has also served as an advisor for parties in Canada, New Zealand, and Sri Lanka. At the 2009 European Parliament elections, Crosby acted as a consultant for Libertas, a pan-European party opposed to the Treaty of Lisbon.\n\nCrosby was born in Kadina, South Australia, and grew up in a rural area of the state, where his father Dudley Crosby worked as a cereal farmer and an arts and crafts shop-owner. He studied economics at the University of Adelaide.\n\nCrosby started his career in 1976 as a market analyst with Golden Fleece Petroleum. He then moved into politics as a research assistant in 1978 for Senator Baden Teague. In 1980 Crosby became executive assistant to the Harold Allison, then Minister of Education and Aboriginal Affairs. Crosby became executive assistant to Martin Cameron in 1992, then Leader of the Opposition in the South Australian Legislative Council. Between 1986 and 1991 Crosby held a number of corporate affairs positions in the Australian private sector.\n\nAt the 1982 South Australian election Crosby unsuccessfully ran for the Liberals in the House of Assembly seat of Norwood. Suffering a 9.2 percent two-party swing compared to the statewide swing of 5.9 percent, he later joked that he \"turned a marginal Labor seat into a safe Labor seat after campaigning there.\"\n\nIn 1991, Crosby became state director for the Queensland division of the Liberal Party of Australia, and in 1994 the party's deputy federal director. He served under federal director Andrew Robb, until replacing him as federal director of the Liberal Party in May 1997. Crosby served as campaign director for the party at the 1996, 1998, 2001, and 2004 federal elections. In 1998, the government won with marginal seats (swing seats) targeted by Crosby. The election saw the smallest two-party-preferred margin win since 1949 estimates, on 49.02 percent.\n\nIn 2002, Crosby established an election consulting firm, the Crosby Textor Group, with an associate, Mark Textor. As a result, he left his position with the Liberal Party. Crosby was also involved in setting up CT Financial, an investor relations and financial communications specialist consultancy, in 2006.\n\nIn November 2012 Crosby sued Mike Kelly, the parliamentary secretary for defence, for libel for alleging on Twitter that Crosby had used push polling.\n\nCrosby managed the Conservative Party's 2005 United Kingdom general election campaign but was unable to help leader Michael Howard defeat the incumbent Prime Minister Tony Blair. During Crosby's time as campaign manager, the Conservative used attention grabbing slogans such as \"It's Not Racist to Impose Limits on Immigration\" and \"How Would You Feel if a Bloke on Early Release Attacked Your Daughter?\"\n\nCrosby was also appointed to run Conservative Boris Johnson's successful 2008 London mayoral election campaign, at a cost to the party of £140,000 for four months of work. The \"Daily Mail\" alleged that Crosby had urged Johnson to focus his campaign on traditional Tory voters instead of \"fucking Muslims\", but Crosby later said through a spokesperson that he had no memory of using that phrasing.\n\nIn March 2009 it was announced that Crosby would direct the Europe-wide Libertas campaign for the June 2009 European Parliament elections. Despite running 600 candidates, the movement only managed to get one MEP elected, and folded shortly after.\n\nIn July 2013, following the government's rejection of a plan to remove branding from cigarette packets, British Prime Minister David Cameron was urged by Liberal Democrat members of the governing coalition to sack Crosby as his chief election strategist because of Crosby's connection to the tobacco industry. Liberal Democrat MP Paul Burstow was quoted as saying: \"Lynton Crosby cannot remain at the heart of government while he is also serving the interests of the tobacco industry. If he does not go the Prime Minister should sack him.\" In July 2013 it was reported in \"The Guardian\" and elsewhere that Crosby Textor, the company which he co-founded (which is known as CTF Partners in the UK) had advised private healthcare providers on how to exploit perceived \"failings\" in the National Health Service in 2010. Crosby issued \"The Guardian\" with a legal challenge over their reporting. The issue resurfaced in mainstream news sources a few days before the 2015 UK general election.\n\nIn 2014 it was revealed that having been hired in 2012 by Philip Morris International, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, Crosby lobbied Lord Marland, then parliamentary undersecretary for intellectual property and a former Conservative party treasurer, to oppose the introduction of plain packaging on cigarettes. This revelation came in papers released under the Freedom of Information Act by the Intellectual Property Office.\n\nIn the 2016 London mayoral election, it was reported that Crosby was involved in linking the Labour candidate Sadiq Khan to terrorist organisations. This campaign tactic is understood to have backfired – it was poorly received by the public, many of whom saw the campaign as Islamophobic, and Khan beat Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith.\n\nIn April 2017 Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Crosby would play a leading role in the Conservatives' campaign for the 2017 general election, which May had called early. May failed to secure an outright Conservative majority and author Hannah Jane described Crosby as running a \"disastrous, horrendously negative campaign\".\n\nOn 3 October 2017, during the Conservative Party Conference, it was reported that Amber Rudd had hired Crosby, amid speculation that she was planning to launch a bid for leadership of the party.\n\nIn 2018, Crosby allegedly contacted Boris Johnson in an attempt to force a leadership battle against Prime Minister Theresa May in order to \"destroy\" her flagship Brexit policy, which he views as a betrayal of the Brexit voters. It has also been suggested by the press that his opposition to Theresa May's deal was \"revenge\" for Theresa May blaming her losses at the 2017 general election on him.\n\nIn 2019, \"The Guardian\" announced it had seen documents revealing that multiple outwardly independent groups behind adverts on Facebook promoting a hard Brexit are administrated by employees of Lynton Crosby's lobbying firm, CTF Partners.\n\nAccording to investigative journalist Nicky Hager, Crosby was an adviser to the former Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key.\n\nDuring the 2015 Sri Lankan parliamentary election, Crosby was an advisor to incumbent Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, whose United National Front captured a plurality of seats and formed a governing coalition along with President Maithripala Sirisena's Sri Lanka Freedom Party. The campaign featured widespread adverts that contrasted \"good governance\" offered by the incumbent Prime Minister with the \"jungle law\" of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose ten-year rule was marked by family corruption and strident nationalism after the 2009 defeat of the Tamil Tigers.\n\nIn early September, at the height of the 2015 Canadian federal election campaign, Crosby was brought on as a Conservative Party strategist. At this point, the Conservative campaign had hit a low point as the Tories fell to third place behind the Liberals (who had started the campaign in third place) and the New Democratic Party, which had led at the beginning of the campaign.\n\nCrosby's decision to use identity politics, publicising the issue of a Muslim woman refusing to remove her niqab when swearing the Canadian oath of citizenship, became one of the key issues of the campaign.\n\nThe Liberal Party went on to win a majority government in what was described as a \"stunning rout\", reminiscent of the Parti Quebecois' loss to the unaffiliated Quebec Liberal Party the year before, in which identity politics had also been used to unintended disadvantage. The party's increase of 148 seats from the previous election was the largest-ever numerical increase by a party in a Canadian election.\n\nCrosby says he has never been involved with political campaigns in Canada. The Crosby Textor consulting firm has stated that neither Crosby nor anyone else in the firm was involved in the Canadian general election campaign, nor travelled to Canada during the campaign. Regardless, the spokesperson for the Conservative Party of Canada during the 2015 campaign, Kory Tenecke, stated on camera that Crosby was assisting the campaign and that Crosby had had lengthy relationship with the Party. The magazine Maclean's extensively discussed Crosby being retained by the Conservatives, his use of polarising anti-Muslim rhetoric, and his hasty departure. Many prominent Conservatives, after being thoroughly routed by the populace and the Liberal Party of Canada, claimed that \"they got the tone wrong\".\n\nCrosby is described as favouring what is called a wedge strategy, whereby the party he advises introduces a divisive or controversial social issue into a campaign, aligning its own stance with the dissenting faction of its opponent party, with the goal of causing vitriolic debate inside the opposing party, defection of its supporters, and the legitimising of sentiment which had previously been considered inappropriate. This is also described as \"below the radar\" or dog-whistle campaigning. Crosby has combined this with the targeting of marginal constituencies and highly localised campaigning, latching on to local issues and personalities. To find such divisive and potentially deflecting issues, Crosby's business partner Mark Textor runs focus groups to find which groups to target with what questions. Crosby is said to run a tight ship, focus on simple messages, target marginal constituencies and use lots of polls.\n\nIn a 2013 article for \"The Daily Telegraph\", Boris Johnson noted that one of Crosby's tactics when losing an argument because the facts are against you was to do the equivalent of \"throwing a dead cat on the table\": bring up an issue you want to talk about that draws widespread attention from the populace, forcing opponents to also talk about your new issue instead of the previous issue.\nAccording to \"the Guardian\", Michael Fallon was the implementer of the strategy in the 2015 when he accused Ed Miliband of preparing to drop Trident as part of a deal with the Scottish National Party at a moment when the Labour party were starting to pull ahead in the polls.\n\nCrosby is married to Dawn \"née\" Hands, an Australian, with whom he has two adult daughters: Tara and Emma. Crosby and his wife are UK residents.\n\nIn 2005, Crosby was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (postnominals AO), for \"service to politics\". He had previously received the Australian government's Centenary Medal, for \"service to Australian society through politics\".\n\nCrosby was knighted in the UK's 2016 New Year Honours \"for political service\". The honour sparked criticism from figures in the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats, who accused Cameron's government of engaging in political cronyism.\n\nCrosby's supporters note that Spencer Livermore, a strategist for the Labour Party, had been awarded a life peerage earlier in the year.\n\n\n"}

The Act, which followed close on the heels of the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, was drafted by the United States House Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration and on July 29, 1958 was signed by President Eisenhower. Prior to enactment, the responsibility for space exploration was deemed primarily a military venture, in line with the Soviet model that had launched the first orbital satellite. In large measure, the Act was prompted by the lack of response by a US military infrastructure that seemed incapable of keeping up the space race.\n\nThe original 1958 act charged the new Agency with conducting the aeronautical and space activities of the United States \"so as to contribute materially to one or more of the following objectives:\"\n\nIn 2012, a ninth objective was added: \n\nThe Act abolished the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), transferring its activities and resources to NASA effective October 1, 1958. The Act also created a Civilian-Military Liaison Committee, for the purpose of coordinating civilian and military space applications, and keeping NASA and the Department of Defense \"fully and currently informed\" of each other's space activities. To this day, the United States has coordinated but separate military and civilian space programs, with much of the former involved in launching military and surveillance craft and, prior to the Partial Test Ban Treaty, planning counter-measures to the anticipated Soviet launch of nuclear warheads into space.\n\nIn addition, the new law made extensive modifications to the patent law and provided that both employee inventions as well as private contractor innovations brought about through space travel would be subject to government ownership. By making the government the exclusive provider of space transport, the act effectively discouraged the private development of space travel. This situation endured until the law was modified by the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984, enacted to allow civilian use of NASA systems in launching space vehicles.\n\nThe phrase \"We came in peace for all mankind\", inscribed on a plaque left on the Moon by the crew of Apollo 11, is derived from the Act's declaration of NASA's policy and purpose:\n\nThe Act was subsequently amended to remove gender bias , so that this policy statement now reads:\n\n\n"}

When this occurs at the moment of birth such a person is said to be \"born on the cusp\" and some believe that their life is influenced by the characteristics of both signs. For example, if an individual was born when the Sun (by convention the point at the centre of the Solar disc) was located at 29 degrees, 50 minutes Gemini, then one might say that he was born on the cusp of Gemini and Cancer. Much of the Solar disc was actually in Cancer even though the centre was in Gemini.\n\nAlthough the term \"cusp\" is universally used for the boundaries of signs, not all astrologers agree that an object can ever be included in more than one sign. Many consider relevant only the location of the Sun's centre, which must be entirely in one sign, and would describe the natal Sun in the example as simply being in Gemini. If late degrees of Gemini have a Cancer-like character, they would describe that as simply the nature of that part of Gemini rather than some influence spilling over from the next sign.\n\nOn the other hand, astrologers who consider objects \"on the cusp\" to be meaningfully different from objects entirely in one sign may apply such a description even when no part of the object crosses the boundary. That point of view may consider the Sun to be \"on the cusp\" even when its centre is as much as two degrees away from the sign boundary. They may also call other objects (much less than half a degree in diameter) \"on the cusp\" despite no part of the object being in the adjacent sign. Their claim is that the influence of the cusp gets weaker but does not suddenly disappear as the object gets further from the cusp.\n\nA similar debate applies to cusps between houses. \n"}

His siblings were George Langdon Bonython (1846–) and Alfred MacBain Bonython (1865–1954). The family migrated to South Australia in July 1854 where Bonython was educated at the Brougham School in North Adelaide. In 1870 he married Mary Louisa Fredericka Balthasar (Marie Louise Friedrike, or Marie Louise Frederica); they had eight children of whom three daughters and three sons survived infancy.\n\nWhen he was sixteen, Bonython took a job at \"The Advertiser\", where he was well regarded as a hard worker. In 1879, he became a part proprietor of \"The Advertiser\".\n\nIn 1894, Bonython became the sole proprietor and editor of \"The Advertiser\", positions which he held for a further 35 years. During this time, the weekly \"Chronicle\" and the evening \"Express\" newspapers were added to \"The Advertiser\".\n\nHe retired from his newspapers in 1929, after 65 years' service. On 12 January 1929, Adelaide paper \"The Mail\" announced that Langdon Bonython had sold \"The Advertiser\" for £1,250,000 to a group of Melbourne financiers, but had retained a considerable interest.\n\nThroughout his career, Bonython had avoided local politics, but after Federation in 1901 he was nominated to represent the single statewide Division of South Australia as a Protectionist in the Australian House of Representatives at the 1901 election. He ultimately finished second in the poll and was one of seven members elected. At that time, South Australia was a single electorate with multiple members.\n\nAt the 1903 election, Bonython was elected unopposed for the newly created Division of Barker. In 1904, he was a member of the Select Committee on old-age pensions, as well as the Royal Commission on the same subject in 1905–1906.\n\nBonython did not stand for reelection at the 1906 election, and retired from politics. In 1908 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) \"In recognition of service to the Commonwealth of Australia\".\n\nIn 1883, Bonython was elected chairman of the Adelaide School Advisory Board. In 1889 he became the president of the council for the South Australian School of Mines and Industries, a position he held until his death. He often assisted the school with his own money, and provided the funds for the chemical and metallurgical laboratories there.\n\nBonython became chairman of the council of the agricultural college at Roseworthy in 1895, and he held this position until 1902.\n\nHe was knighted in 1898.\n\nHe was appointed one of fourteen trustees under the soldiers' repatriation programme of 1916, and one of seven commissioners under the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act 1917.\n\nBonython joined the council of the University of Adelaide in 1916, and donated over £50,000 for the construction of a hall, and £20,000 to fund a Chair in law. From 1916 to 1926, Bonython was also the deputy chairman of the South Australian advisory council of education. He donated £100,000 towards the construction of Parliament House in Adelaide.\n\nIn 1919 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) \"In recognition of service to the Commonwealth\".\n\nBonython was vice-president of the Royal Institution of Cornwall from 1900 until becoming president from 1932–33, succeeding Viscount Falmouth. Despite living in Australia, and being unable to visit Cornwall during his presidency, he became one of the most active and hard working presidents that the institution had had. In 1931 he gave £2,000 to the Royal Cornwall Museum building fund and the Bonython gallery on the ground floor was named in his honour.\n\nHis wife, Lady Bonython, was also active in altruistic causes, notably the Kindergarten Union and State Children's Council, in association with Catherine Helen Spence and C. Emily Clark.\n\nBonython died in 1939, leaving an estate of over £4,000,000, which at the time was estimated to be one of the largest of any Australian. Beneficiaries under his will included the Pirie Street Methodist Church, where he always worshipped and of which he was a trustee; St Peter's Cathedral, to which he donated the cost of the canons' and choir stalls in 1925 in memory of his wife who had died the previous year; and the Salvation Army.\n\nOn 24 December 1870 Bonython married Mary Louisa Fredericka Balthasar ( – 9 February 1924) in Adelaide. She is also referred to in various references as \"Marie Louise Friedrike\", \"Marie Louise Frederica\", and after Langdon's knighthood in 1898, Lady Bonython.\n\nThey had eight children of whom three daughters and three sons survived infancy. Outliving his wife and four of his children, he was survived by three daughters and one son, (John Lavington Bonython).\n\nHis children included:\n\n\nBonython was descended from an old Cornish family, well known in Tudor and Stuart times. Inspired by his grandmother, Bonython took an interest in his heritage. He had a fine library of books on Cornish history and was patron of the South Australian Cornish Association and a member of the Royal Institution of Cornwall. Although he acquired some family relics, he deeply regretted that he could not buy back Bonython Manor, the family seat in Cornwall. After purchasing a large mansion in North Adelaide in 1908, he renamed it 'Carclew' after the area in Cornwall which his ancestors were from.\n\nBonython told \"The Literary Digest\": \"It is a Cornish name and the accent is on the second syllable: \"Bon-y'thon\", \"y\" as in \"spy\". The ancient family located at Bonython in the Lizard district at a very early period. Existing deeds show that Stephen Bonython was in possession of the family lands in 1277.\"\n\nBonython was knighted in 1898. In 1908 he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), and in 1919 was promoted to Knight Commander of that Order (KCMG).\n\nIn 1935, Bonython was made the first Australian bard of the Cornish Gorseth Kernow.\n\nThe Division of Bonython, an Australian Electoral Division in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, was named after Bonython.

He was one of the longest reigning Muslim rulers.\n\nAl-Mustansir was born in Cairo on 16th Jumada II, 420 AH, to Ali az-Zahir and Rasad, a black slave from Nubia. At the age of only eight months he was declared the heir of his father. His name was Abu Tamim Ma‘ad, surnamed al-Mustansir bil-Lah (\"The Asker Of Victory From God\"). He ascended to the Fatimid Caliphate throne on 15th Shaban, 427/June 13, 1036 at the age of . During the early years of his Caliphate, the state affairs were administered by his mother. His rule lasted for 60 years, the longest of all the caliphs, either in Egypt or elsewhere in Islamic states. However, Fatimid power was confined to Egypt due to conquests of Seljuks in the Levant and Normans in Sicily and Malta. Al-Mustansir was considered incapable and as such his court was dominated by military strongmen and his mother's favourite officials, while the treasury was exhausted by factional infighting.\n\nHe had constructed a special mihrab at one of a pillar in the Mosque of Ibn Tulun. Atop the mihrab, his name is engraved along with the Shahada commonly recited by the public in Fatimid era ending with the phrase 'Ali-un-Vali-ul-lah'.\n\nProminent Dai/Vizir of his era are as under:\nMoulai Abadullah and Syedi Nuruddin were two Indian who visited Imam Al-Mustansir Billah, Egypt. He joined the Ismaili faith under Fatimid Dai Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi, and went to India to propagate the faith.\n\nProminent architecture of his era are as under:\n\nBetween 457/1065 and 464/1072, famine degraded conditions in Egypt from bad to worse. Meanwhile, in 454/1062 and again in 459/1067, the struggle between the Turkish and Sudanese soldiery deteriorated into open warfare, ending in a victory for the Turks.\n\nDuring this same period, Berber nomadic tribes from lower Egypt deliberately aggravated the distress by ravaging the countryside, destroying the embankments and canals of the Nile. The ten thousand animals that al-Mustansir's stables once held reportedly deteriorated to the point where only three thin horses were left; it is said that eventually al-Mustansir alone possessed a horse, and that when he rode out, the courtiers followed on foot, having no beast to carry them; it is also said that his escort once fainted from hunger as it accompanied him through the streets. As long as the calamity lasted, the condition of the country continued to decline. The protracted famine was followed inevitably by plague; whole districts were absolutely denuded of population and house after house lay empty.\n\nConcurrently, the Turkish mercenaries had drained the treasury; many of the works of art and valuables of all sorts in the palace were sold to satisfy their demands---often they themselves were the purchasers, at merely nominal prices, and resold the articles thus gained at a profit. Emeralds valued at 300,000 dinars were bought by one Turkish general for 500 dinars, and in one fortnight of the year 460/1068 articles to the value of 30,000,000 dinars were sold off to provide pay for the Turks. The precious library, which had been rendered available to the public and was one of the attractions for many who visited Cairo, was scattered; the books were torn up, thrown away, or used to light fires. At length, the Turks began fighting amongst themselves. Nasir al-Dawla ibn Hamdan, the general of the Turks, had invested the city, which was defended by the rival faction of the Turkish guard; after burning part of Fustat and defeating the defenders, he entered as conqueror. When he reached the palace, he found al-Mustansir lodged in rooms which had been stripped bare, waited on by only three slaves, and subsisting on two loaves which were sent him daily by the daughters of Ibn Babshand, the grammarian.\n\nThe victorious Turks dominated Cairo, held the successive viziers in subjection, treated al-Mustansir with contempt, and used their power to deplete the treasury by enhancing their pay to nearly twenty times its former figure. Nasir al-Dawla became so overbearing and tyrannical in his conduct that he provoked even his own followers, and so at length he was assassinated in 466/1074. Unfortunately, this left the city in a worse condition than ever, for it was now at the mercy of the various Turkish factions, who behaved no better than brigands. Conditions in Egypt continued to deteriorate, and unabated violence raged in the streets and countryside alike.\n\nUsing the genealogical information of the members of the Fatimid dynasty imprisoned by Saladin, and contemporary documents, the historian Paul E. Walker estimates that al-Mustansir had \"at the minimum seventeen sons whose names we can recover\". Indeed, he suggests that it was precisely the great number of offspring he sired during his long reign that created the succession crisis after his death.\n\n\n"}

During his reign actual power rested with the Choe family of military dictators.\n\nAlthough ascending to the throne in 1213, Gojong did not wield much power until powerful advisors were killed off. In 1216, the Khitan invaded but was defeated. In August 1232, Gojong moved the capital of Goryeo from Songdo to the island of Ganghwa and started the construction of significant defenses there, in order to better defend from the Mongol threat. Gojong resisted the Mongol invasion for nearly thirty years before the kingdom was forced to make peace with the Mongols in 1259; Gojong died soon after.\n\nIn 1251, the carving of the Tripitaka Koreana, a collection of Buddhist scriptures recorded on some 81,000 wooden blocks, was completed.

The live band included keyboard player Brian Cox, who is now a professor of physics and a television presenter; although Cunnah, as the only official member, normally played keyboards (along with all other instruments) on studio recordings.\n\nD:Ream first came to prominence with the euphoric single \"U R the Best Thing\" in the summer of 1992, an anthemic piano-house tune which did not chart but thanks to a Sasha remix was Pete Tong's Essential Tune of 1992. \"Things Can Only Get Better\", released in the spring of 1993, gave the group their first chart success. \"U R The Best Thing\" was eventually re-released in April 1993 and gave the group their second chart hit. The band were nominated for Best Dance act in the MTV Europe music awards in 1994 and for Best Single in the Brit Awards in 1995.\n\nThe band's first album, \"D:Ream on Volume 1\", which was promoted for almost two years, produced seven singles (\"Star\" and \"I Like It\" came on a joint release as a double A-side).

Universal-International's first public announcements, early in 1953, employed the soon-discarded title, \"Moonlight Serenade.\"\n\nThe film follows big band leader Glenn Miller (1904–1944) (James Stewart) from his early days in the music business in 1929 through to his 1944 death when the airplane he was flying in was lost over the English Channel during World War II. Prominent placement in the film is given to Miller's courtship and marriage to Helen Burger (June Allyson), and various cameos by actual musicians who were colleagues of Miller.\n\nSeveral turning points in Miller's career are depicted with varying degrees of verisimilitude, including: the success of an early jazz band arrangement; his departure from the Broadway pit and sideman work to front a band of his own; the failure of his first band on the road; and the subsequent re-forming of his successful big band and the establishment of the \"Miller Sound\" as typified by \"Moonlight Serenade\". Also depicted is Miller's international success touring his band in support of the Allies in World War II.\n\nThere are several anachronisms in the picture. When the military band led by Miller is playing in front of General \"Hap\" Arnold, a B-29 bomber is in the background. The marching troops are desegregated, which didn't happen until 1948. Scenes ostensibly shot in England are clearly staged in the U.S., as witness the presence of RCA Type 44 microphones during a BBC broadcast. In reality, the BBC could not afford them and commissioned its own, cheaper version.\n\nIn addition, several key plot points are either highly fictionalized from actual events or were invented for the film:\n\n\nThe following artists all appeared as themselves:\n\nUpon release in 1954, \"The Glenn Miller Story\" was massively successful at the box office. In 1954, the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Screenplay (by Valentine Davies and Oscar Brodney) and Best Score (by Henry Mancini and Joseph Gershenson). The film won the Academy Award for Best Sound Recording, by Leslie I. Carey. Its soundtrack was equally successful, reaching number one on the Billboard album charts in 1954, featuring a number of Glenn Miller's most popular recordings. This is the second of three movies that paired Jimmy Stewart and June Allyson, the others being \"The Stratton Story\" and \"Strategic Air Command\".\n\nStewart took a percentage of the profits. In 1955, William Goetz estimated that Stewart had earned $2 million from the film.\n\nGlenn Miller Orchestra pianist John \"Chummy\" MacGregor was a technical advisor on the movie. Composer Henry Mancini composed the musical score with Joseph Gershenson, who conducted the Universal-International studio orchestra's recreations of Miller's arrangements on the soundtrack. Miller's band was portrayed by \"The Airmen of Note\", an ensemble of the United States Air Force Band originally created in 1950 to carry on the Glenn Miller tradition.\n\nThe movie was reissued in 1985 with a stereo soundtrack. The film was originally recorded in stereo but was initially released in mono. It was screened out of competition at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe critical reception to \"The Glenn Miller Story\" was generally positive to mixed. The film currently holds an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on eight reviews.\n\nThe film was originally released on home video in the VHS format in 1986. On March 4, 2003, the film was released onto DVD with an anamorphic display, remastered surround sound, and subtitles. The film can also be found in a James Stewart DVD collection that was released in 2007.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray in Germany on July 24, 2014.\n\nShout Factory announced the release of the movie on Blu-ray on November 20, 2018.\n\nThe soundtrack included many big band pieces originally performed by Glenn Miller's orchestra.\n\n\nThe film contains songs by musicians who also make cameo appearances in the film. These cameos include: Louis Armstrong, Barney Bigard, Cozy Cole, Gene Krupa, Frances Langford, Skeets McDonald, Marty Napoleon, Ben Pollack, Babe Russin, Arvell Shaw, The Modernaires, James Young and Ray Conniff.\n\nThe original soundtrack to the movie, \"The Glenn Miller Story---Sound Track\", Decca DL 5519 (USA)/BML 8647 (UK), was number one for 10 weeks on the \"Billboard\" albums chart in 1954. The 1954 album contained eight selections. The soundtrack was re-released with an expanded track list. The album \"Glenn Miller Plays Selections From the Film \"The Glenn Miller Story\"\" was number one for 11 weeks on the \"Billboard\" albums chart the same year, released as RCA Victor LPT 3057. The original 1954 album contained eight selections. An expanded version of the latter album was certified Gold in 1961 by the RIAA.\n\nThe tribute album \"I Remember Glenn Miller\", Capitol H 476, by Ray Anthony was number nine on the same Billboard album chart for that week. The extended play versions of the same albums also reached the same position on the \"Billboard\" EP charts for that week. The Modernaires released a 45 single on Coral Records, 9-61110, A Salute to Glenn Miller, which included medleys in two parts from the movie soundtrack, Parts 1 and 2: (I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo/Moonlight Cocktail/Elmer's Tune/Moonlight Serenade/Chattanooga Choo Choo/String of Pearls/Serenade In Blue/At Last/Perfidia, that reached number 29 on the Billboard charts in 1954.\n\n\n"}

Between January 1988 and November 1999 he was Scientific Director at the German Climate Computing Centre (DKRZ, Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum), Hamburg. Currently he is Vice-Chairman of the European Climate Forum. The European Climate Forum has been founded in September 2001 by Prof. Carlo Jaeger and Prof. Klaus Hasselmann.\n\nHasselmann has published papers on climate dynamics, stochastic processes, ocean waves, remote sensing, and integrated assessment studies.\n\nHis reputation in oceanography was primarily founded on a set of papers on non-linear interactions in ocean waves. In these he adapted Feynman diagram formalism to classical random wave fields. He later discovered plasma physicists were applying similar techniques to plasma waves, and that he had rediscovered some results of Rudolf Peierls explaining the diffusion of heat in solids by non-linear phonon interactions. This led him to review the field of plasma physics, rekindling an earlier interest in Quantum Field Theory.\n\n\"It was really an eye-opener to realize how specialized we are in our fields, and that we need to know much more about what was going on in other fields. Through this experience I became interested in particle physics and quantum field theory. So I entered quantum field theory through the back door, through working with real wave fields rather\nthan with particles.\"\n\nHasselmann has won a number of awards over his career. He received the 2009 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Climate Change; in January 1971 the Sverdrup Medal of the American Meteorological Society; in May 1997 he was awarded the Symons Memorial Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society; in April 2002 he was awarded the Vilhelm Bjerknes Medal of the European Geophysical Society.\n\nIn 1966, following his review of plasma physics, Hasselmann ventured into fundamental theoretical physics, finally publishing in 1996 what he calls \"the metron model\", which he describes as possibly laying the foundation for a unified deterministic theory of fields and particles. He proposes that, unlike in quantum field theory, particles have localized, objective reality.\n\nInitially following the Kaluza–Klein programme, he suggested that in a higher-dimensional generalization of general relativity there may exist stable vacuum solutions having the nature of solitons, which he calls \"metrons\" (\"\"metr\"ic solit\"ons\"\"). The metrons also possess a \"linear far-field region, which carries the classical gravitational and electromagnetic fields, as well as a high-frequency periodic field that satisfies the de Broglie dispersion relation.\"\n\nThe theory is claimed to reproduce gravitational and electroweak forces, along with spin, Bragg diffraction, the basics of atomic spectra, and the symmetries of the Standard Model.\n\nSince so-called hidden variables are involved, the theory must deal with the Bell inequalities. Hasselmann does this by showing that the theory produces time reversal invariance at the subatomic level, and posits both advanced and retarded potentials, as proposed by Feynman and Wheeler.\n\nIn his most recent publication, in 2005, he was able to qualitatively reproduce the interference pattern observed in electron double-slit experiments. He was also considering reformulating his theory in four-dimensional spacetime, since the properties associated with the higher dimensions are oscillatory and can be represented as fiber bundles over a 4D Minkowski manifold. Hasselmann notes that substantial obstacles remain: beyond the task of actually calculating some stable metron solutions, the theory currently predicts a continuum of solutions rather than a discrete spectrum of particles, and future development will have to reproduce the highly accurate predictions of QFT.\n\nHasselmann hopes that his theory, which he is still developing, will eventually yield all particle properties and universal physical constants from first principles.\n\nAlthough Hasselmann's metron papers have been published in peer reviewed journals (though not of first rank), they are not widely cited and following Hasselmann's own sentiments should be considered a serious, but quite speculative, attempt at an alternate formulation of reality.\n\n\"Once the theory is published in accepted journals, it will become either accepted or rejected. This is as it should be. I am not really concerned about the outcome, which is beyond my control.\"\n\nHasselmann met with unexpected resistance when he ventured into fundamental physics:\n\n\"I presented a talk at a physical colloquium in Oldenburg, and a couple of people sprung up afterwards and shouted that it was a scandal that somebody should give such a talk in a physical colloquium. It was almost a religious reaction. I felt I was in one of those pre-election political talk shows that sometimes get out of hand.\n\n\"I had not experienced such violent antagonism before. When I first presented the nonlinear wave interaction theory, people like Bill Pearson or Francis Bretherton emphatically said I was all wrong, but this was in the normal civilized framework of people being sceptical and arguing. And the established SAR experts were critical but not outright hostile when I trespassed in their area to develop a theory for the SAR imaging of ocean waves. Traditional economists also showed only mild irritation, or simply smiled condescendingly, when I came up with alternative economic models. I suppose there was never this feeling that I was attacking anybody's foundations. The Oldenburg hecklers were – I suspect somewhat frustrated – elementary particle physicists.\"\n\n\nFor a complete list of references, refer to \"Interview mit Klaus Hasselmann\", 59, 2006. or Hasselman's website at Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology\n\n"}

Making rapid progress, he obtained at twenty the Grand Prix de Rome, and in 1748 set out for Rome. He studied the works of Annibale Carracci, Pietro Berrettini da Cortona, Giulio Romano and Michelangelo, then visited Naples, Bologna and, crucially, Venice. While in the latter city Doyen was greatly influenced by the work of the famous colourists, such as Titian.\n\nIn 1755 returned to Paris and, at first unappreciated and disparaged, he resolved by one grand effort to achieve a reputation, and in 1758 he exhibited his \"Death of Virginia\". It was completely successful, and procured him admission to the \"Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture\". Doyen was also influenced by Peter Paul Rubens after a visit to Antwerp. This influence is, perhaps, best displayed in his \"Le Miracle des ardents\", painted for the church of St Genevieve at St Roch (1767). This painting was exhibited in the salon of 1767, which was recorded by Saint-Aubin in \"View of the salon of 1767'\". Art historian Michael Levey described this painting as the 'high point' in the artist's career, suggesting the drama of the piece may be a precursor to that which characterises the French Romantic painting of the 19th century. He notes how the writhing figures of the foreground are similar to those found in \"The Raft of the Medusa\" by Théodore Géricault. In 1773 Doyen painted his \"The Last Communion of St Louis\" for the high altar of the chapel at the École Militaire; it is strongly reminiscent of \"The Last Communion of St Jerome\" by Domenichino and displays a sharp clarity of message, required by its position far above the high altar. Another notable work of this period in Doyen's life is the \"Triumph of Thetis\" for the chapel of the Invalides. In 1776 he was appointed professor at the Academy.\n\nDuring the initial stages of the French Revolution he became active in the national museum project; however in 1791 he left France for Russia on the invitation of Catherine II of Russia. He settled in St Petersburg, where he was much honoured by the Imperial family and Russian art establishment. He died there on 5 June 1806.\n"}

The new KCLSU eventually took over the organisation of the King's College students' social activities and the athletics club, having been formally established at a general meeting of King's students held on 4 December 1908.\n\nThe first president was F. Hanson and for a number of years, it remained an all-male organisation until the arrival of female students in 1915. The most famous President of KCLSU was Sir Ivison Macadam who governed in 1922 and became the first President of the newly merged National Union of Students. An early honour board in the main building dates from 1908 with the name of the first President of the KCLSU.\n\nFollowing the various mergers and de-mergers of colleges in the University of London with King's, many collegiate students' unions records have either been misplaced or are possibly stored in the King's archives.\n\nKCLSU's official mascot is Reggie the Lion. In his early years, he would often be paraded on sports grounds by teams to support matches. There are at least four official \"Reggies\" in existence: the original, on display in KCLSU's Student Centre at the Strand Campus, a papier-mâché Reggie outside the Great Hall at the Strand Campus (pictured), a miniature display Reggie outside Willie's Common Room in the East Wing of Somerset House, and a small sterling silver incarnation displayed during graduation ceremonies. In 2003-04 he celebrated his 80th birthday, which was celebrated by a reunion of students' union officers from years past. In September 2009 the crown from the papier-mâché Reggie in the Strand Campus was stolen by first year Medical students from RUMS and is now housed in the bar of the Huntley Street Union.\n\nBeing such an easily liftable mascot that was often seen in public, Reggie was an obvious target for marauding students from other institutions. In the 1970s, Reggie was buried upside-down in a pit near Waterloo station, which was filled with concrete; the tip of his tail remained visible. Later, he was lost for many years in the 1990s, and not recovered until he was found in a field. Having been restored at the cost of around £15,000, Reggie has been placed on display in a glass case in the \"Lion's Walk\", Macadam Building (Strand campus) in 2002, after being filled with concrete to prevent theft, particularly by University College London (UCL) students who, prior to his burial and dumping, had also castrated him. King's students had also stolen one UCL mascot, Phineas and, allegedly played football with the head of another, Jeremy Bentham.\n\nReggie is often styled \"His Royal Highness\", but there is no recent policy on the matter, and this convention has fallen into disuse as mascotry in London has declined.\n\nA small woolly Reggie on wheels was presented to the then Duke and Duchess of York in 1926 as a toy for the infant Princess Elizabeth (now HM The Queen). Apparently the gift was a huge success. The Duchess wrote a thank you note saying: “Princess Elizabeth is quite delighted with the red lion and refuses to play with anything else.” Another Reggie soft toy was presented in 2019 to the Duchess of Cambridge as a gift for the young Prince George of Cambridge during a visit to KCLSU with Her Majesty The Queen to open its new Bush House building.\n\nRoar! News is the tabloid for students at King's College London and is owned and funded by KCLSU. It is editorially independent of both the university and the students' union and its award winning website is read by tens of thousands of people per month in over 100 countries.\n\nKCLSU Student Media won Student Media of the Year 2014 at the Ents Forum awards and came in the top three student media outlets in the country at the NUS Awards 2014.\n\nKCL Radio is the SRA award winning Student Radio Station run by and for King's students, currently podcasting weekly and live streaming special events.\n\nLocated at Strand Campus at Bush House in Central London - previously the headquarters of the BBC World Service - it broadcasts on-campus and worldwide via its website. It has been a member of the Student Radio Association since its inception.\n\nThe station was originally established in 2009 as a podcasting society at King's called \"The Pod Radio\" . Its current website was launched in 2010, broadcasting pre-recorded podcasts from the Macadam Building on the Strand Campus. In 2013, the station began to produce live broadcasts for the first time via its website, hosting up to 45 hours of live programming per week during term times. These were played in KCLSU shared spaces, as well as via the TuneIn platform and online. As part of KCLSU Student Media, KCL Radio was ranked as one of the top three student media outlets in the UK at the 2014 NUS Awards. The station won Silver for Best Student Radio Station at the 2016 SRA Awards. In 2018, the station's tagline was rebranded as \"The Kings and Queens of Student Radio\" Later in 2018, the station was moved to Bush House after the sale of the Macadam Building by KCLSU.\n\nKCL Radio is on-air twenty-four hours a day and features over 65 hours of live programming every week during term times . Programming falls into four main categories: music, entertainment, news, and sports. These are headlined by a flagship show in each category, which were pioneered in 2017.\n\nThe station also hosts a number of podcasts, which are not recorded live. These are produced in the podcasting room at Bush House, located directly opposite the main broadcasting studio.\n\nThe Civil Row is branded as the \"flagship current affairs panel show\" and the centre for political discussion at King's College.\n\nKCLSU provides student representation, spaces and activities for students to connect to each other and academic advice. The Academic Advice service provides much of the individual advice and representation to students regarding academic issues and misconduct, while the democratic structures - which are made up of the elected Student Trustees, part-time Officers (which includes Liberation Officers), and full-time Student Officers, who take a sabbatical year to work - enable the Union as a whole to express an opinion on almost any matter related to its charitable objectives. However, like other students' unions, KCLSU does not affiliate to any political party or religious group.\n\nKCLSU also provides almost all the sports clubs, societies and volunteering opportunities available at King's with over 50 sports clubs, 250 societies and thriving student-led engagement and volunteering projects. In 2003-04, King's came top in the University of London Union overall sporting leagues and the medical school (which, like others, are permitted their own, separate teams) came third, showing the dedication to sporting excellence in London.\n\nFollowing the closure of the student bar at St Thomas' Hospital in 2005 and the Waterfront Bar in 2017, KCLSU now operates three bars, two cafes, over 12 rooms of indoor Student Activity Space through its four student hubs and the Union Shop.\n\nIn October 2005, KCLSU was awarded the Investors in People standard. In January 2006, due to increased student concern for the global community, KCLSU took its two-year Fairtrade University campaign as a major priority. In March 2006, the Fairtrade Foundation awarded King's College London Fairtrade University status. It has run campaigns on flexible payment plans for all students, installing nap-pods for those spending long hours at the library, and ensuring better access for disabled students. According to filings with the Charity Commission, it is digitally transforming its services and communications and now engages more students than ever before with a particular focus on engaging postgraduate students. It invested over £1.8m into student groups last year and put £600,000 back into student pockets by providing decent work with London Living Wage to student staff.\n\nKCLSU offers students three bars and two cafes spread across the Strand and Guy's campuses.\n\nKCLSU is not officially affiliated to any political party. In recent years the political affiliation of the Presidents has varied between Labour, Independent and Conservative. In 2006/07 the President was Labour. 2008-2009 saw a Conservative elected, suspended, and then finally impeached for alleged racist comments at a NUS training event. 2009 to 2011 saw the re-election of a two-term President, Ryan Wain, who was regarded by many as a member of the progressive left. Before 2006 the students elected as President were Conservative from 2003 to 2005, and Labour from 1999-2003.\n\nNotable campaigns have included those for widening participation, hidden course costs, housing and accommodation, employment and religious exception.\n\nIn November 2010, King's students founded London's first student-led think tank, the KCL Think Tank. With a membership of approximately 2000, it is the largest organization of its kind in Europe. This student initiative organizes lectures and discussions in seven different policy areas, and assists students in lobbying politicians, NGOs and other policymakers with their ideas. Every September, it produces a peer-reviewed journal of policy recommendations called \"The Spectrum\".\n\nThe governance of KCLSU has changed much in its history.\n\nPast structures included a proportionally elected Student Representative Council (similar to a 'parliament') with a 14-strong directly elected 'cabinet', known as the Executive Committee ('Exec') who are also the Trustees of the union. Five Executive Officers are full-time, taking a 'sabbatical' year either at the end or in the middle of their degree. They were informally described as the 'sabbatical officers' ('sabbs') but in theory hold no more constitutional weight on the Exec than the part-time officers. Before this, policy was determined at Union General Meetings, which all full members of KCLSU were entitled to attend and vote at.\n\nThis structure then changed to a 30 strong, cross campus, un-proportionally elected Student Council from 2006-7 until 2010-11. The SC was made up of students still studying on their course, and so representation was a voluntary activity. The SC was supported by and worked with four elected full-time Student Officers (still often referred to as Sabbs).\n\nFor the 2010-11 academic year, Student Council evolved into a 50 strong cabinet of cross campus elected students. Within the 50, councillors had specific or open roles, with the council being made up as follows:\n30 General Representatives - who work with all students in mind\n7 Campaign Officers - who work to represent particular 'constituencies', or causes, identified as under represented by KCLSU Officers in the summer 2011\n4 Liberation Officers - who work to represent 'oppressed' groups, as identified by the NUS: Women, LGBT, Disabled and BME students\n5 NUS delegates - who will attend the NUS annual conference in the Spring, as well as working to represent students at King's throughout the year to Council\n4 Academic Board reps - who alongside attending and representing students at Council, also represent students at the College's 4 Academic Boards.\n\nIn 2004, KCLSU launched an ambitious, wide-ranging and grassroots review of its governance. A management consultant (formerly a student union General Manager) and a leading firm of charity lawyers worked together to examine the nature of the legal relationship between the College and the Union, where the responsibility lay, and how best to serve the interests of students. The report was published in early 2005 and suggested a set of proposals that would reflect the balance of responsibility and authority within the students' union.\n\nOne key proposal involved a slimmed down Trustee board, including non-sabbatical student Trustees and part-time non-student Trustees, in a ratio of 2:1 students and non-student and 2:1 part-time and full-time, with complete Executive power vested within them. The Student Representative Council being the ultimate decision-making body could not be continued as it was incompatible with Charity law and the statutes of the Union.\n\nThe Trustee Board now has overall responsibility for the legal, strategic and financial health of KCLSU.\n\n"}

{"id": "1809700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809700", "title": "Karma Kagyu", "text": "Karma Kagyu\n\nKarma Kagyu (), or Kamtsang Kagyu (), is a widely practiced and probably the second-largest lineage within the Kagyu school, one of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. The lineage has long-standing monasteries in Tibetan Autonomous Region, China, China, Russia, Mongolia, India, Nepal and Bhutan, with current centres in over 60 countries. The spiritual head of the Karma Kagyu is the \"Gyalwa Karmapa\"; the 2nd through 10th Karmapas were principal spiritual advisors to successive emperors of China. The Karma Kagyu are sometimes called the \"Black Hat\" lamas, in reference to the Black Crown worn by the Karmapa.\n\nThe Kagyu lineage claims a continuity of oral instructions transmitted from master to disciple. This emphasis is reflected in the literal meaning of \"Kagyu\". The first syllable, \"ka,\" is said to refer to the texts of Buddha’s teachings and to the master’s verbal instructions. \"Ka\" has the double meaning of the enlightened meaning imparted by a teacher’s words, as well as the strength that such words of insight may bear. The second syllable, \"gyu,\" means lineage or tradition. The combination of these syllables thus means “the line of orally transmitted instructions.” The elders in the Kagyu lineage, representing the theoretically uninterrupted line of masters and disciples reaching back to Buddha (Vajradhara), are jointly known as the “Golden Rosary.”.\n\nThe Karma Kagyu was founded by Düsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama. It is headed by the Karmapa; followers believe that the Karmapa's appearance as the first historical consciously reincarnate lama (tulku) was predicted by Gautama Buddha in the Samadhiraja Sutra.\n\nThe Karma Kagyu school belongs to the Vajrayana branch of Mahayana Buddhism. It conceives itself as a member of the third turning of the dharmacakra and participates in the Rimé movement. Important teachings of the Kagyu school include the Buddhist philosophical traditions of Yogacara and Madhyamaka, as well as the tantric tradition of Chakrasamvara, among others.\n\nThe view known as Shentong (empty of other) has become popular in Karma Kagyu, due to its promotion by the influential Rimé philosopher Jamgön Kongtrül Lodrö Thayé (1813–1899). This Shentong view has been upheld by various modern Kagyu masters such as Kalu Rinpoche and Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche. However, as noted by Karl Brunnholzl, several important Kagyu figures have disagreed with the view of \"Shentong Madhyamaka\", such as Mikyö Dorje the 8th Karmapa Lama (1507–1554) and Pawo Tsuglag Threngwa, the second Pawo Rinpoche, both of whom see \"Shentong\" as another name for Yogacara and as a separate system to Madhyamaka. Both of these figures, as well as the Ninth Karmapa, Wangchuk Dorje, criticized the Shentong view and held that the teachings on Buddha nature were of expedient meaning.\n\nThe central yogic practice of the Karma Kagyu is the doctrine of Mahamudra, also known as the \"Great Seal\". This doctrine focuses on four principal stages of meditative practice (the Four Yogas of Mahamudra):\n\n\nIt is through these four stages of development that the practitioner is said to attain the perfect realization of mahamudra. Mahamudra is practiced both independently and as the completion stage of Vajrayana practice.\n\nWithin the Karma Kagyu, meditative practice is almost invariably presented in a progressive manner. Early practice includes samatha, introduction to Buddhist history and philosophy and initiation into the lower tantras - classically across the iṣṭadevatās () Avalokiteśvara, Tārā and Amitābha. This is followed by ngöndro and vipassanā. During the traditional three-year retreat, retreatants usually focus their practice on the Six Yogas of Naropa. At the Anuttarayoga Tantra level of practice, the principal iṣṭadevatās of the lineage are Dorje Pakmo, Hevajra and Cakrasaṃvara.\n\nThe supreme lama of the Karma Kagyu is the Karmapa, who always presides as lineage holder once he has reached his majority and received all the necessary training and dharma transmissions. From the death of one Karmapa until the next takes his seat as lineage holder, one (or more) of the previous Karmapa's principal disciples holds the lineage. Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa left the lineage in the hands of four eminent lamas: the 14th Shamarpa, the 12th Tai Situpa, the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul and the 12th Goshir Gyaltsab. There is controversy over who is the 17th Karmapa, with two major candidates both having been recognized and enthroned by their supporters. Neither candidate has been enthroned at Rumtek Monastery.\n\nThe direct master-disciple transmission of the lineage holders of the Karma Kagyu is known as the Golden Rosary of Kagyu Fathers. They are:\n\nBecause of the Karmapa controversy, the identities of the next lineage holders have not been definitively identified. In all likelihood, they are either:\n\nor\n\nAt the next level of precedence, all Kagyu Lamas who have been accorded the title Rinpoche (Lit: precious one) are highly regarded as trustworthy teachers. Those who hold the Khenpo degree have completed the equivalent of a doctorate in Buddhist studies.\n\nThere are (both currently and historically) many female Kagyu Lamas. For example, in the Refuge Tree pictured above, two of the figures floating in the sky above the tree (dakini Sukhasiddhi and Machig Labdrön) are great historical female Lamas of the lineage. Mindrolling Jetsün Khandro Rinpoche is a living female tulku of the Karma Kagyu. Probably the most well-known active female Kagyu Lamas in the West are Ani Pema Chödrön and Tsultrim Allione.\n\nKarma Kagyu (Trinley Thaye Dorje)\n\nKarma Kagyu (Orgyen Trinley Dorje) \n\nPages\n"}

Their staff who deal with clients are known as stock and station agents. They advise and represent farmers and graziers in business transactions that involve livestock, wool, fertiliser, rural property and equipment and merchandise on behalf of their clients. The number and importance of these businesses fell in the late 20th century.\n\nThese rural business services institutions originated, when communications were slow and often very difficult, to cope with the double remoteness of early Australian and New Zealand primary producers from their nearest settlement and, particularly in the case of wool, from their overseas markets. In practice, they were the pastoralist's banker. Similar and sometimes the same organisations operated in Latin America and the Midwestern United States, which had extensive pastoral farming.\n\n\nThese businesses grew to provide their clients with every product or service they might want right from employees or seasonal working capital to, in the person of a client's personal stock agent, close personal friend and personal confidant who regularly visited them, maintained the client's loyalty and kept them up to date with events in the community and their industry. His branch manager might often be unable to maintain an easy relationship with clients unable to fulfill their financial obligations. The branch manager's knowledge of his client's business activities was such and his control over the client's spending was such he could ration their spending on sugar and flour.\n\nThey also act as local managers of properties on behalf of absentee owners deceased estates and mortgagees technically in possession of properties.\n\nThey provide retail stores in small towns for agricultural requirements selling, for example, animal health supplies, animal feed, fencing materials, fertilizer, machinery and tools, and even clothing and groceries.\n\nAn important activity is to organise regular local livestock sales at a community's commercial saleyards. Small rural communities may hold a single annual sale at local saleyards and this may be the highlight of their autumn business and social calendar.\n\nA vital and well-liked part of their rural community, in remote areas, stock agents perform a variety of commercial and social functions. They bring to outlying homesteads on farms and stations stores, mail and newspapers, local news and gossip.\n\nNext the stock agent turns to real work and: \nreports to his client on market trends and prices; \nsorts stock into lines for sales; \nsorts prime animals for the freezing works; \nvalues livestock and advises on different marketing options for stock; \narranges penning and auction; \narranges private sales between sellers and buyers.\narranges transport of stock to saleyards; \nconducts sales of wool on behalf of clients on a commission basis; \nsells a wide range of agricultural products including chemicals; \narranges clearing sales of surplus machinery plant and equipment; and \narranges insurance.\n\nHe also advises and assists clients in the management of agricultural or pastoral companies, stock or farming problems; \narranges finance for the buying of livestock or property; and \nbrings prospective buyers to inspect properties for sale.\n\nIndividual stock agents, within the same agency, may specialise in any one of the preceding activities.\n\n\"Arranged marriage: Farmers expect their stock agents to perform a range of tasks and services. One agent even acted as a go-between for a client who wanted to get married but was too shy to propose to the woman!\"\n\nThe close and enduring individual client relationships which are formed are seen as a forerunner of the newer concept of relationship marketing.\n\nIn his history of the industry Simon Ville says: \". . . the stock and station agent has been a legendary figure in local folklore, connected or related to many individuals and groups, a central figure embedded in rural settler communities and about whom everyone has had a view. This social perspective helps inform our understanding of the agent's role and importance in economic activities since trust, reputation, and personal connection were the vital lubricants in sustaining business relationships and networks.\"\n\nSome of these businesses grew very large in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.\n\n"}

Brokaw, a Civil War widow. His father, John Nelson Cromwell, died in the Battle of Vicksburg.\n\nHe worked as an accountant for the attorney Algernon Sydney Sullivan, who paid for his education at Columbia Law School and made him a partner in Sullivan & Cromwell in 1879. In 1898 the chief of the French Canal Syndicate (a group that owned large swathes of land across Panama), Philippe Bunau-Varilla, hired him to lobby the US Congress to build a canal across Panama, and not across Nicaragua, as rivals would have it. Cromwell showed that Nicaragua had an active volcano. On June 19, 1902, three days after senators received stamps showing volcanic activity in Nicaragua they voted for the Panama route for the canal. For his lobbying efforts, he received the sum of $800,000. (about million USD today).

{"id": "1809714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809714", "title": "Ryutin affair", "text": "Ryutin affair\n\nThe Ryutin affair (1932) was one of the last attempts to oppose the General Secretary Joseph Stalin within the All-Union Communist Party.\n\nMartemyan Ryutin was an Old Bolshevik and a secretary of the Moscow City Communist Party Committee in the 1920s. In December 1927 – September 1930, he was a candidate (non-voting) member of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and a supporter of the moderate (\"Rightist\") wing within the party led by the communist theoretician Nikolai Bukharin and prime minister Alexei Rykov. When the latter were defeated and demoted by Stalin in 1928–1930, Ryutin was demoted as well. In September 1930 he was expelled from the Communist Party; six weeks later, he was arrested for oppositionist views. He was released on 17 January 1931 and allowed to re-join the party, but remained silently opposed to Stalin's regime.\n\nAt the beginning of the 30s, against the backdrop of forced collectivization, widespread famine and mass deportation, the opposition to the Stalinist course strengthened within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Opposition currents began to reappear, such as the underground organization of Ivan Smirnov and a group formed by Georgy Safarov, Nikolai Uglanov. Even new illegal entities started appearing, such as the group formed by Sergey Syrtsov and Vissarion Lominadze and another formed by Aleksandr Petrovich Smirnov, Nikolai Borisovich Eismont and Vladimir Tolmachyov..\n\nWith Stalin now firmly in control of the Communist Party and all dissent punishable by immediate expulsion and exile, Ryutin decided to act in secret. In June 1932 he wrote a pamphlet entitled \"Appeal to All Members of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)\" and a nearly 200-page document entitled \"Stalin and the Crisis of the Proletarian Dictatorship\" (more commonly known as \"Ryutin's Platform\"). In these documents Ryutin called for an end to forced collectivization (\"peace with the peasants\"), a slowing down of the industrialization, the reinstatement of all previously expelled Party members on the left and on the right (including Leon Trotsky), and a \"fresh start\". Four of the Platform's thirteen chapters examined the character of Stalin, whom Ryutin called \"the gravedigger of the Revolution\" and \"the evil genius of the Party and the revolution\". Ryutin's \"Appeal\" was even more inflammatory, arguing Stalin \"must be removed by force\" and urging its readers \"to everywhere organize cells of the 'Union' to be joined under the banner of Leninism for the liquidation of the Stalin dictatorship\".\n\nRyutin gathered around him a group of like-minded friends who called themselves \"The Union of Marxist-Leninists\"; they began to distribute the \"Appeal\" to workers and to members of the opposition in the summer and early autumn of 1932. Nikolai Bukharin's former comrades, the \"Red Professors\" - Alexander Slepkov, Dmitri Maretsky, and Jan Sten - helped to distribute the manifestos. Sten gave copies to Lev Kamenev and to Grigory Zinoviev, while Slepkov provided the documents to a group of Trotskyists in Kharkov. Nearly all of the former leaders of the \"Right Opposition\" - Mikhail Tomsky, Nikolai Uglanov, and Alexei Rykov - saw the \"Appeal\". Benyamin Kayurov also aligned himself with the group. An informer soon betrayed the \"Union\" to the OGPU secret-police and to Stalin. On 23 September 1932 Ryutin was arrested along with other suspects.\n\nOn 27 September the Presidium of the Central Control Commission hastily convened to investigate and deal with the Ryutin group. Twenty-four members attended, including Yan Rudzutak, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky, Avel Yenukidze, Aaron Soltz, and Lenin's sister, Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova. They authorized the OGPU \"to uncover the still undetected members of Ryutin's counterrevolutionary group\" and to acquaint \"these white guard criminals...with the entire strictness of revolutionary law\". The final report of the Presidium, released on October 9, expelled twenty-four people from the party and banished them from Moscow for varying lengths of time. The members of the \"Union\" were characterized as \"degenerate elements who have become the enemies of communism and of Soviet power, as traitors to the party and the working class, who have tried to form an underground bourgeois-kulak organization under a fake 'Marxist-Leninist' banner for the purpose of restoring capitalism in general and kulakdom in particular in the USSR\". The OGPU referred the matter of Ryutin's fate to the ruling Politburo.\n\nA stenographic record of this Politburo meeting has not been located. A number of historians, led by Robert Conquest, have adopted the argument first advanced by Boris Nicolaevsky in \"The Letter of an Old Bolshevik\" (1936), that a division existed in the Politburo between moderates and hard-liners. Stalin argued that Ryutin deserved the death penalty, because his \"Appeal\" could inspire its readers to acts of terrorism and a palace coup. A moderate bloc of Politburo members opposed Stalin, because they were unwilling to violate Lenin's stricture against the spilling of Bolshevik blood. Sergei Kirov supposedly spoke with \"particular force against the recourse to the death penalty\" and was joined to a greater or lesser extent by Sergo Ordzhonikidze, Valerian Kuibyshev, Stanislav Kosior, and Yan Rudzutak, while Stalin's position was supported only by Lazar Kaganovich. According to historian Arch Getty, Nicolaevsky's story is a \"persistent myth.\" He points to an incident from eighteen months before when the Politburo voted for a very harsh penalty for the opposition and Stalin moderated the punishment. It is known that Ryutin received the harshest penalty. He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. Former United Opposition leaders Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, who had read the Platform, were also expelled from the Communist Party in October 1932 and exiled to the Urals region for failure to report the incident to the secret police.\n\nRyutin was eventually executed on 10 January 1937, during the Great Purge, which also claimed the lives of Bukharin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Kosior, Rudzutak, Uglanov, Yenukidze, Rykov and most of the rest of the Old Bolsheviks.\n"}

According to official results, he won 1% of the vote.\n\nOn August 23, Lawson called on the people to vote in the October 2007 parliamentary election, describing the election as a \"decisive step forward\" and saying that the country \"must return to democratic principles, to survive and to develop\". He was critical of independent candidates, who he said did not have political programs and would only increase confusion in a country that already had about 80 parties. Lawson was the first candidate on the PRR's candidate list in Lomé in the 2007 election, but the party did not win any seats.\n"}

He played for eighteen seasons for Yorkshire County Cricket Club, for England from the 1898/99 tour to 1912, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1901.\n\nBorn in Berry Brow, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England, Haigh played club cricket for Keighley Cricket Club, and made his debut for Yorkshire in 1895, playing for the Tykes until 1913. He played sporadically for England from 1898/99 to 1912, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.\n\nHe bowled right-hand medium pace, but could vary it with slower or faster deliveries, and when the pitch helped him he made the ball spin back from the off. The usefulness of Haigh's break-back saw over 74 per cent of his wickets taken without assistance from fieldsmen – the highest of any bowler with over 500 wickets.\n\nHowever, because he was of slight build, Haigh was not able to undertake arduous spells of bowling, and his output of overs was always low for a frontline bowler. Moreover, he lacked the pace to be threatening against top batsmen on a good pitch. Haigh was never considered for a tour of Australia, and his record in Test cricket – apart from one match on matting in South Africa – was modest compared to his exploits in the county game.\n\nHe has the lowest average of any bowler taking 1,000 wickets since 1895 except for Hedley Verity. Haigh was also a determined batsman, who hit 1,000 runs in 1904, and scored a hundred before lunch in 1901, and was a keen fieldsman.\n\nHaigh began with Yorkshire as a fast bowler with a difficult slower ball. Using such methods, combined with the break-back, Haigh was seen in 1896 as the hard-wicket bowler Yorkshire were looking for. He took 84 wickets for just over 15 runs each, and took 8 for 78 on a good wicket against the Australians.\n\nHowever, the following year the strain on his slight frame of bowling fast began to tell on Haigh, and though his 91 wickets at 18.75 placed him in the top twenty of the national averages, he was already noticed to be less formidable than Yorkshire's other bowlers on firm pitches, but quite unplayable after rain – as in the home games with Surrey and Derbyshire. Although he produced a skilful performance against Middlesex at Lord's on a hard pitch the following year, Haigh did comparatively little of note except on sticky wickets. On such sticky wickets his return of 14 for 43 beat Hampshire in a day's cricket. Haigh's batting developed and he averaged 26 in 1901, and saved Yorkshire from defeat at Worcestershire in 1900. That year, Haigh took 163 wickets for just over 14 each, and in 1902 he took 158 wickets in 799 overs.\n\nCalled to the Test side with a sticky wicket expected in 1905, Haigh had a surprising off-day and was not picked again until 1909. He came close to heading the national averages for five successive seasons – being only shaded out by Albert Hallam in 1907, in which year he took 13 for 40 against Warwickshire. Yorkshire bowlers such as Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst were utilised in longer spells with Haigh benefiting later on. After a poor season in 1910, Haigh returned to form in 1911 and 1912. His 96 wickets for 11.41 was decisive in Yorkshire's County Championship win, but another unsuccessful Test appearance, and that he then aged forty-one made him decide to move into coaching at the end of 1913. He did retain his place for Yorkshire primarily as a batsman with a long series of useful – though never large innings, whilst his bowling lapsed into decline.\n\nAfter 1913 Haigh was a coach at Winchester School, where he was responsible for the emergence of Douglas Jardine. He also umpired several first-class matches at the Scarborough Festival after he retired.\n\nHaigh died prematurely in Taylor Hill, Huddersfield, in early 1921, as a result of a stroke.\n\n"}
{"id": "1809740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809740", "title": "Atom cluster", "text": "Atom cluster\n\nClusters with a definite number and type of atoms in a specific arrangement are often considered a specific chemical compound and are studied as such. For example, fullerene is a cluster of 60 carbon atoms arranged as the vertices of a truncated icosahedron, and decaborane is a cluster of 10 boron atoms forming an incomplete icosahedron, surrounded by 14 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe term is most commonly used for ensembles consisting of several atoms of the same element, or of a few different elements, bonded in a three-dimensional arrangement. Transition metals and main group elements form especially robust clusters. Indeed, in some contexts, the term may refer specifically to a metal cluster, whose core atoms are metals and contains at least one metallic bond. In this case, the qualifier polynuclear specifies a cluster with more than one metal atom, and heteronuclear specifies a cluster with at least two different metal elements. Naked metal clusters have only metal atoms, as opposed to clusters with outer shell of other elements. The latter may be functional groups such as cyanide or methyl, covalently bonded to the core atoms; or many be ligands attached by coordination bonds, such as carbon monoxide, halides, isocyanides, alkenes, and hydrides. \n\nHowever, the terms is also used for ensembles that contain no metals (such as the boranes and carboranes) and whose core atoms are held together by covalent or ionic bonds. It is also used for ensembles of atoms or molecules held together by Van der Waals or hydrogen bonds, as in water clusters.\n\nClusters may play an important role in phase transitions such as precipitation from solutions, condensation and evaporation of liquids and solids, freezing and melting, and adsorbtion to other materials.\n\nAtom cluster compounds, including metal clusters, have been unwittingly used by humans since antiquity. The oldest artificially produced metal cluster may be calomel , which was known in India already in the 12th century.\n\nThe elucidation of the structure of cluster compounds only became possible in the 20th century. For instance, the existence of a mercury to mercury bond in calomel was established in the early 1900s. These advances were made possible by the development of reliable structural analysis tools, such as single-crystal X-ray diffraction.\n\nThe term \"cluster\" was used by F.A. Cotton in the early 1960s to refer specifically to compounds containing metal–metal bonds. \n\nCarbon clusters were first detected by Eric A. Rohlfing, Donald M. Cox, and Andrew Kaldor in 1984, in experiments where graphite was vaporized by laser and the vapor was quenched by a helium atmosphere. Analysis of the condensed products with a mass spectrometer revealed a preponderance of molecules with certain \"magic numbers\". In 1985 their work was repeated by Harold Kroto, James R. Heath, Sean O'Brien, Robert Curl, and Richard Smalley, who proposed the truncated icosahedron structure for the prominent C molecule, and proposed the name \"buckminsterfullerene\" for it.\n\nThe physical and chemical properties of atom clusters are very different from those of bulk solid with the same composition. The difference is due to the fact that a large fraction of their component atoms is found at their surface. For cluster cores with fewer than a couple dozen component atoms or molecules, the stable configurations usually have most or all atoms adjacent to the core's surface, and thus only partially bound to other core elements. \n\nA gradual transition occurs between the properties of the molecular species and those of the corresponding bulk mix with increasing number \"N\" of atoms in the core, since he fraction of atoms adjacent to its surface will scale approximately as \"N\". If \"N\" is 10, when the cluster can be considered a nanoparticle, only about 10% of the atoms in the core will be exposed at its surface. That is still significant percentage, which is part of the reason why the properties of nanoparticles are still significantly different from those of the bulk substance.\n\nTransition metal clusters are frequently composed of refractory metal atoms. In general metal centers with extended d-orbitals form stable clusters because of favorable overlap of valence orbitals. Thus, metals with a low oxidation state for the later metals and mid-oxidation states for the early metals tend to form stable clusters. Polynuclear metal carbonyls are generally found in late transition metals with low formal oxidation states. The polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory or Wade's electron counting rules predict trends in the stability and structures of many metal clusters. Jemmis \"mno\" rules have provided additional insight into the relative stability of metal clusters.\n\nUnstable clusters can also be observed in the gas-phase by means of mass spectrometry, even though they may be thermodynamically unstable and aggregate easily upon condensation. Such naked clusters, i.e. those that are not stabilized by ligands, are often produced by laser induced evaporation - or ablation - of a bulk metal or metal-containing compound. Typically, this approach produces a broad distribution of size distributions. Their electronic structures can be interrogated by techniques such as photoelectron spectroscopy, while infrared multiphoton dissociation spectroscopy is more probing the clusters geometry. Their properties (Reactivity, Ionization potential, HOMO–LUMO-gap) often show a pronounced size dependence. Examples of such clusters are certain aluminium clusters as superatoms and certain gold clusters. Certain metal clusters are considered to exhibit metal aromaticity. In some cases, the results of laser ablation experiments are translated to isolated compounds, and the premier cases are the clusters of carbon called the fullerenes, notably clusters with the formula C, C, and C. The fullerene sphere can be filled with small molecules, forming Endohedral fullerenes.\n\nThere is an infinite variety of compounds whose molecules are atom clusters or have such cluster at their core. Below are some classes that have received substantial attention from researchers.\n\nMetallocarbohedrynes (or met-car for short) area family of clusters with molecular formula , where M is a transition metal such as titanium, vanadium, zirconium, niobium, hafnium, molybdenum, chromium, or iron. They can be generated by vaporizing the desired metal with a laser, in an atmosphere containing the suitable hydrocarbon. They have been also detected, at a concentration of 1% or less, in the soot generated by an electric arc between two Ti-C electrodes. They feature metals atoms at the corners of a cube, but with the carbon atoms pushed inwards so as to be nearly coplanar with the faces of that cube.\n\nZintl compounds feature naked anionic clusters that are generated by reduction of heavy main group \"p\" elements, mostly metals or semimetals, with alkali metals, often as a solution in anhydrous liquid ammonia or ethylenediamine. Examples of Zintl anions are [Bi], [Sn], [Pb], and [Sb]. Although these species are called \"naked clusters,\" they are usually strongly associated with alkali metal cations. Some examples have been isolated using cryptate complexes of the alkali metal cation, e.g., [Pb] anion, which features a capped square antiprismatic shape. According to Wade's rules (2n+2) the number of cluster electrons is 22 and therefore a closo cluster. The compound is prepared from oxidation of KPb by Au in PPhAuCl (by reaction of tetrachloroauric acid and triphenylphosphine) in ethylene diamine with 2.2.2-crypt. This type of cluster was already known as is the endohedral Ni@Pb (the cage contains one nickel atom). The icosahedral tin cluster Sn or stannaspherene anion is another closed shell structure observed (but not isolated) with photoelectron spectroscopy. With an internal diameter of 6.1 Ångstrom, it is of comparable size to fullerene and should be capable of containing small atoms in the same manner as endohedral fullerenes, and indeed exists a Sn cluster that contains an Ir atom: [Ir@Sn].\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1809747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809747", "title": "Lucena, Philippines", "text": "Lucena, Philippines\n\n', officially the ', (), known simply as City, is a 1st class highly urbanized city in Calabarzon region. It is the capital city of the province of Quezon where it is geographically situated but, in terms of government and administration, the city is politically independent from the province. For statistical and geographical purposes, is grouped with the province of Quezon. According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIn the 1570s, Captain Juan de Salcedo first explored what was the province of Tayabas. The Franciscan priests Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa between 1580 and 1583 founded its town, also named Tayabas. Tayabas was organized by the Spaniards through the Franciscan missionaries and Lucena was just one of its barrios.\n\nThe Spaniards of the 16th century called the area \"Buenavista\" because of its scenic beauty; several years later, the barrio was renamed \"Oroquieta\". A century later, Muslim pirates began terrorizing the entire Philippine coastline, and Oroquieta was not spared from the notorious raids. The barrio folks built forts along the seashores to defend it against the attacking pirates along the coast, particularly in the present-day Cotta and in Barangay Mayao, though these structures are no longer extant. Hence, the place became known as Cotta, the Spanish form of the Tagalog \"\"kuta\"\" (\"fort\"). The growth of local maritime trade facilitated in the Cotta port and the final defeat of Moro pirates plying the Luzon and Visayan waters, afforded the growth of Lucena as a town which eventually led to its being the capital of Tayabas, Quezon province in 1901.\n\nFinally on November 5, 1879, the Orden Superior Civil officially adopted the name \"Lucena\" in honor of a Spanish friar by the name of \"Father Mariano Granja\" in Andalucia, Spain. Fr. Granja was responsible for the development of the barrio that became a Parish in 1881. Lucena became an independent municipality on June 1, 1882.\n\nDuring the 1896 Philippine Revolution, the people of Lucena showed their brand of patriotism. José Zaballero led the local revolutionists who were under the barrage of Spanish muskets. Later, Miguel Arguilles with Jose Barcelona as President formed a revolutionary government in Lucena.\n\nAfter Aguinaldo proclaimed the nation's independence on June 12, 1898 in Kawit, Cavite, Gen. Miguel Malvar, as Commanding General for Southern Luzon, took over Tayabas Province on August 15, 1898. Don Crisanto Marquez became Lucena's first elected Municipal president during the first Philippine Republic.\n\nLucena's fertile soil became soaked with the blood of many Filipinos and Americans at the outbreak of the Filipino-American War in 1899. The foreigners established a civil government in the country, and on March 12, 1901, the provincial capital was transferred from Tayabas to Lucena.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Japanese Imperial Force occupied Lucena on December 27, 1941, 19 days after they set foot on Philippine soil. But the underground resistance movement was so tenacious in Lucena that by January 25, 1945 (even before the Americans have returned), the Hunters ROTC guerrillas penetrated into the town and successfully drove out the Japanese. The rest of Quezon Province (new name of Tayabas Province) had to wait for the American Liberation forces and the Philippine Commonwealth troops to hand freedom on April 4 of that same year.\n\nOn June 17, 1961, by virtue of Republic Act No. 3271, Lucena was made into a Chartered City through the efforts of then Congressman Manuel S. Enverga. It was officially inaugurated on August 19, 1962, during the 84th anniversary of Manuel Luis Quezon. On July 1, 1991, Lucena became a Highly Urbanized City.\n\nIn May 2014, the Lucena City Public Market was razed by fire while festivities were being held for the culmination of Pasayahan sa Lucena a few blocks away. The whole block of the public market building was burned down. Through the cooperation of firefighters from Sariaya, Tayabas, Pagbilao and Lucena. In October 2016, a new state of the art Public Market building was opened to the public. The 2-storey building, which reportedly cost 99 million pesos to build, was financed through loans. According to the article, the Lucena Public Market was also burned down in 1965 along with huge parts of the city.\n\nOn October 2019, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) completed the construction of a P245-million underpass along the Pan-Philippine Highway or the Manila South Road (MSR) Diversion Road in Brgy. Gulang-gulang, Lucena City, Quezon. The project was initially funded in the 2017 national budget at around ₱100 million. The remaining half was funded through the 2018 national budget. According to DPWH Secretary Mark Villar, the 472-meter long underpass with a 16 lineal-meter concrete bridge at the Lucena-Tayabas-Mauban Port Road aims to reduce the traffic congestion around the Daang Maharlika Route. This new underpass would directly shorten the travel time of those traversing Quezon Province such as those coming from Manila going to the Bicol region and vice versa. \n\nIt is situated 132 kilometers (82 mi) south of Manila. The city proper is wedged between two rivers, Dumacaa River on the east and Iyam River on the west. Seven other rivers and six creeks serve as natural drainage for the city. Its port on the coast along Tayabas Bay is home to several boat and ferry lines operating and serving the sea lanes between Lucena and the different points in the region and as far as the Visayas.\n\nThere exists a Lucena Airport (known locally as 'Landing') located 300 meters west of AMA College Lucena Campus but is no longer usable. Light aircraft can no longer make use of it as a road was built as an intersection during the presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\nBeing the provincial capital, Lucena is host to most of the branches of governmental agencies, businesses, banks and service facilities in the Southern Tagalog region.\nLucena is politically subdivided into 33 barangays.\n\nLucena falls under Type III of the Corona's climatic classification system. It is characterized by no pronounced wet and dry seasons. Generally, the wet season is from June to November and sometimes extends up to December when the southwest monsoon is predominant. The dry season is from January to May but is sometimes interrupted by erratic rainfall. The annual mean temperature is , with February as the coldest month with temperatures dropping to , and May as the warmest month with temperatures reaching up to . \"Habagat\" monsoon winds pass through the province from June to October while northeasterly winds or Amihan blows through the islands from December to February.\nEconomic activities in Lucena are heavily concentrated in the \"poblacion (bayan)\" and other suburban barangays where the highly dense and constricted central business district (CBD) is home to a large cluster of different business enterprises. As population grows in tandem with new and promising business prospects, business activities spill over adjoining barangays, thus forming mini satellite commercial areas.\n\nOther commercial strips are located in the \"poblacion\" and suburban barangays where both retail and wholesale trade, including other essential services, are being engaged in. SM City Lucena is the biggest mall in the city located in Ibabang Dupay, which is one of the first SM Malls in Luzon. Other Shopping Centers Include: SM Savemore Agora, Super Metro Lucena, Pacific Mall Lucena and many more.\n\nBig factories and warehouses are present in these suburban barangays like San Miguel Brewery, Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., PepsiCo Philippines, Inc., Asia Brewery, Inc. Nestlé Philippines, and Ginebra San Miguel, Inc. (formerly La Tondeña Distillers Inc.), do business in sales, distribution, and transport of assorted business products in bulk.\n\nOf the total 8,316.90 hectare land area of Lucena City, 19 percent or 1,651.77 hectares cover the existing built up area. Almost 3% of this or 46.62 hectares cover the industrial section, located in different barangays of the city. These areas are home to significant industrial and manufacturing activities.\n\nIndustry in Lucena produces a sustainable amount of agro-industrial based products, dried and smoked fish, distilled liquors, bamboo and rattan furniture, ornamental flowers/plants, vegetable as well as meat products.\n\nLucena is also known as the \"Cocopalm City of the South\". Nestled midst a wide expanse of coconut lands, Lucena has coconut oil mills which produce oil-based household products like cooking oil, soap, lard, margarine, and oil based medicines. Exora Cooking Oil and Vegetable Lard, and Miyami Cooking Oil are proudly made in this city. Tantuco Industries, JnJ Oil Industries, Inc., and Monaco Oil Company are some of the well-known coconut oil companies in the city.\n\nCar assembly and manufacturing plants have also established in the city, while Manila-based car shops are starting to put up some branches like Isuzu-Lucena, SFM-Lucena, and Foton Motor.\n\nRoad network provides access from all key cities and towns in the island of Luzon to this highly urbanized city. Well-paved radial and by-pass routes criss-crossing in and out of the city facilitate the transport of unlimited assortment of merchandise, supplies, and raw materials to and from the city on a round-the-clock basis.\n\nOver the years, it was observed that a growing number of visitors from other places come to Lucena. Travelers of various types and sizes are drawn to Lucena because of modern facilities and good amenities that could be found in the city such as the Quezon Convention Center when the City of Lucena hosted the 2004 SEABA Under-18 Championship qualifying tournament for the 2004 FIBA Asia Under-18 Championship in India, Kalilayan Civic Centre, Sentro Pastoral Auditorium, Alcala Sports Complex a two time host of a Palarong Pambansa (1976, 1989), Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation Gymnasium, Sacred Heart College Gymnasium, and Marcial Punzalan Gymnasium. \n\n\n\nPasayahan sa Lucena was conceptualized to showcase the natural and ecological interrelationship and independence between nature and man. It also promotes the ways of life inherent among the people of Lucena. All these find exquisites and appreciative expressions through a mammoth gathering of colors, outlandish costumes and symbolic floats reminiscent of Mardi Gras in Rio de Janeiro and New Orleans. Originally intended as three days of spirited merrymaking in the streets, the event has become a weeklong tourist attraction, culminating on May 30 in time for the celebration of the Feast of St. Ferdinand, the patron saint of Lucena.\n\nAnother feast highlighting the entire celebration is the Chami Festival that would feature Lucena's very own pansit delicacy. The traditional Chami Festival has a contest of who can cook the most delicious chami. The contestants line up along Quezon Avenue, the city's main road, armed with their cooking utensils and will be provided free chami noodles, meat and other condiments for the cooking fest. All participants were also given cash incentive, gift packs from various sponsors. After the cooking, the spectators were given a chance to eat for free the different taste of chami. They wanted that through this chami cooking festival this city will become a destination of our local and foreign tourists every merry month of May.\n\nPursuant to Chapter II, Title II, Book III of Republic Act No. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991, the city government is to be composed of a mayor (\"alkalde\"), a vice mayor (\"bise alkalde\") and members (\"kagawad\") of the legislative branch Sangguniang Panlungsod alongside a secretary to the said legislature, all of which are elected to a three-year term and are eligible to run for three consecutive terms.\n\nHead of the Municipality during the Spanish Occupation:\n\nMunicipal Presidents during the American Civil Government:\n\nMayors under the Commonwealth Government:\n\nActing Mayors (After World War II):\n\nElected Mayors:\n\nLucena City has a central transportation hub aptly called the Lucena Grand Central Terminal located in Barangay Ilayang Dupay, just midway through the Bicol Region and back. New and modern buses ply the route Buendia/LRT1-Lucena, EDSA Pasay-Lucena, Cubao/Kamias-Lucena and Alabang/Starmall-Lucena or UV Express Van to Taytay, Rizal Via Antipolo City, Manila East Road, Pililla Wind Farm and Laguna East, Lucban, Tayabas. It serves not only Manila -bound buses but also buses going toward the upland and far-flung areas of Quezon province, particularly Bondoc Peninsula towns. Bus companies such as JAC Liner, Lucena Lines, JAM Liner, DLTBCo and N. Dela Rosa Bus Lines bring passengers to Manila and Lucena back and forth. Lucena also has a wide network of jeepney routes, all emanating from the city proper (\"Bayan\") and reaching out to the major barangays of the city, as well as nearby towns. Thousand of tricycles also roam the streets of the city, bringing passengers right at their point of destination. These tricycles usually are the mode of transport when night falls. The South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) Toll Road 4 (TR-4) Extension from Santo Tomas, Batangas will end in Lucena City at the connection of Old Manila South Road. It will be finished by 2019.\n\nThere exists a Lucena Airport, but no commercial flights come to the city. Light aircraft can, however, make use of the facilities.\n\nThe Philippine National Railways (PNR) is on the process of rehabilitating the existing Manila-Bicol and Baguio-Bicol Railway Line, which includes stops in Quezon province, including PNR Lucena station, which traditionally then is a major loading & pick-up point for passengers and cargoes alike when the railway system was once the primary transportation mode going to Manila. Modern air-conditioned coaches will ply this route.\nThe Port of Lucena, located southeast of Manila, is known as the gateway and melting pot city of Southern Luzon. The port complex is built along the fishing village of Barangay Talao-Talao, a kilometer away to the east of Dalahican Fishing Port. The total port area of TMO Lucena is . Operational area of 576.00 square meters and commercial area of 4,598.75 square meters as delineated under Executive order No. 199 dated September 20, 1994 signed by then President Fidel V. Ramos. The port is accessible via the paved provincial road connecting the Dalahican Road and a rough causeway leading to the port. It is 27 nautical miles to Dalahican, and 57 nautical miles to Batangas City and sea distance to Manila is 150 nautical miles. Passenger ferry services include Montenegro Shipping Lines, Phil Nippon Kyoei, and Blue Water Jet\n\nLucena City is served by landline and mobile phone companies like the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) and Digitel Telecommunications (PLDT-Digitel). Major mobile phone providers in the area include Globe, Smart, and Sun Cellular.\n\nLucena has private and public hospitals that are capable of providing most common and advanced medical services, as well as in handling medical emergencies. Both types of institutions are considered to provide the same standard of healthcare and services, differing mainly with the medical and diagnostic facilities at hand.\n\nThese are staffed with qualified medical practitioners that are well-versed in English. The doctors are graduates of the many top reputable medical schools in the Philippines; most have pursued further studies and training in the United States. Likewise, the nurses are the products of the many credible nursing schools in the country. These same institutions have produced the many Filipino nurses working in the United States, Europe, Middle East, and other parts of the world.\n\nIn 2006, the city had a literacy rate of 98.6 percent. It has numerous tertiary and secondary schools, including public and private. The tertiary education system in Lucena provides instruction and training in fields of study, both for baccalaureate degrees and vocational courses. Institutions offering degree programs including liberal arts, arts and sciences, engineering, and information technology include the Lucena Campus of Southern Luzon State University, STI College Lucena along Quezon Avenu Corner Don Perez Street, ABE International College of Business and Economics along Quezon Avenue, Philtech Institute of Arts and Technology Inc. (PIAT), Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation, City College of Lucena along the Maharlika Highway, Columbus College-Lucena, Sacred Heart College (the oldest Catholic school in Quezon Province), Maryhill College, Holy Rosary Catholic School. Aside from tertiary schools, the city also has an expanse footprint on the pre-school, primary and secondary levels of education, both in public and private schools. There are numerous day-care centers found all over the city.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the most famous member of a successful dynasty of painters of Dutch origin. His oeuvre includes every category: religion, history painting, mythology, portraiture, allegory, and genre scenes.\n\nHe was born in Nice, then part of the Duchy of Savoy. Van Loo followed his brother Jean-Baptiste to Turin, and then to Rome in 1712, where he studied under Benedetto Luti and the sculptor Pierre Le Gros. After leaving Italy in 1723, he worked in Paris, studied at the Académie Royale, where he gained first prize for drawing in 1723, and received the first prize for historical painting in 1727—as did his future rival François Boucher. In 1724 he won the Prix de Rome.\n\nAfter again visiting Turin in 1727, he was employed by king Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia, for whom he painted a series of subjects illustrative of Torquato Tasso. In 1734 he settled in Paris, and in 1735 became a member of the \"Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture\" and rose rapidly in the hierarchy of the academy. Madame de Pompadour and the French court were taking the artist under their patronage. He was decorated with the Order of Saint Michael and named First Painter to king Louis XV of France in 1762. He was a most successful court painter but his portraits as well as history paintings also enjoyed an enormous success throughout all Europe. He died in Paris on 15 July 1765.\n\nBy his simplicity of style and correctness of design, the result of his study of the great Italian masters, he did much to purify the modern French school; but the praise that was later lavished upon his productions now appears undue and excessive. His patrons included members of the court, the Gobelins factory, private individuals, and the church. In the ensuing centuries, Van Loo's critical fortune has plummeted, although his ability remains admirable, and the quality and variety of his work command respect. His \"Marriage of the Virgin\" is preserved in the Louvre.\n"}

During its last years, TV Pendidikan was aired on Malaysia's terrestrial channel, TV9 between 2007 and 2008.\n\nIn October 2018, the-then Education Minister Maszlee Malik announced that TV Pendidikan would be relaunched after years of long absence.\n\nTV Pendidikan was relaunched on 6 April 2020 after 12 years of absence and began airing on TV Okey, one of Radio Televisyen Malaysia’s channels. The network made its comeback on RTM after two decades since its last broadcasting in 1999. As of 4 May 2020, The network also made its comeback on Astro since its last broadcasting in 2006.\n\nTV Pendidikan was officially launched on 19 June 1972 by the Second Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Abdul Razak. It was later expanded to Sabah and Sarawak on 30 August 1976. In April 1998, the then Information Minister, Mohamed Rahmat announced the privatization of the network. However, the plan for privatise the network did not materialized as TV Pendidikan is still owned by the Government.\n\nFrom 3 January 2007 until 31 December 2008, TV Pendidikan was aired on Malaysia's terrestrial channel, TV9. Previously, TV Pendidikan was aired through Astro's Channel 28 (from 2000 to 2002), Channel 13 (from 2002 to 2006) and Malaysia's terrestrial television station RTM TV1 and RTM TV2 from 1972 to 1999 respectively.\n\nTV Pendidikan was on RTM TV1 from Monday to Thursday in two sessions; i.e. from 7:20 am to 1:00 pm and 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm. Daytime transmissions on TV1 and TV3 which was introduced in 1994 has caused it to broadcast only on TV2. Also, the closing time was moved to 3:00 pm.\n\nWhen TV Pendidikan moved to Astro in 2000, Astro channel 28 aired two separate networks. TV Pendidikan aired from Monday to Thursday 9.00 am to 5.00 pm. while Animal Planet occupied the rest of the time. As of January 2012, Animal Planet airs on Astro Channel 556.\n\nTV Pendidikan moved to channel 13 in January 2002 where they aired two separate networks, which was TV Pendidikan itself and TechTV, a channel that features news and shows about computer, technology and the Internet. TV Pendidikan broadcast times were not changed, i.e., Monday to Thursday from 9.00 am to 5.00 pm., while TechTV occupied the rest of the time.\n\nSince 1 March 2006, all G4techTV (which is now known as only G4) programmes were shown on Astro TVIQ. Astro educational channel while channel 13 only shows educational programmes. After some time, G4 programmes were no longer airing on Astro TVIQ. Astro also no longer carries TV Pendidikan on its platform since 1 January 2007.\n\nTV Pendidikan's broadcasting hour was from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm every Monday to Thursday for every week of the year, except during public holidays. The programme's episodes are changed every two weeks. For a time since 2007, TV Pendidikan placed a permanent logo at the top-left of the screen and aired simultaneously with the TV9 logo at the top-right only during 4 hours of programming.\n\nTV Pendidikan ceased broadcasting on 31 December 2008. It was later replaced by EDUWEBTV.\n\nEduwebTV is the official webtv of the Ministry of Education, Malaysia which has been introduced since 1 March 2008. It's the first project of its kind in the world! Bridging the digital divide is perhaps the most important factor in ensuring that education reaches every fraction of society. EduwebTV is consist of 4 channels, which are Berita (news), Rancangan Khas (special programme), Kurikulum (curriculum) and Panduan (guidances). The ministry embarked on EduwebTV to replace and to improve the delivery of TV Pendidikan, which was broadcast on TV. It is aimed at addressing the limitation of using educational TV where teachers are unable to fit in the school period.\n\nTeachers nowadays are able to apply relevant video clippings to reinforce their lessons in the classroom. This can make the learning process are more exciting and up to date with current circumstances instead of make students understand more about the knowledge content as they can see it.\n\nEduwebTV also promotes self-learning among students. Students can access the videos and the day's homework from the website by logging on with a password created by the teacher. The students can hand over their homeworks via email or using conventional exercise book.\n\nThe channel covers nine subjects for secondary school:\n\nFor primary school, the program covers:\n\nIn addition, TV Pendidikan also broadcast special shows such as:\n\nDuring its time at TV9, it had also presented its programmes for TV Pendidikan, such as:\n\n\n"}

Originally hailing from Fes, al-Badawi eventually settled for good in Tanta, Egypt in 1236, whence he developed a posthumous reputation as \"Egypt's greatest saint.\" As al-Badawi is perhaps \"the most popular of Muslim saints in Egypt\", his tomb has remained a \"major site of visitation\" for Muslims in the region.\n\nAccording to several medieval chronicles, al-Badawi hailed from an Arab tribe of Syrian origin. A Sunni Muslim by persuasion, al-Badawi entered the Rifa'iyya spiritual order (founded by the renowned Shafi'i mystic and jurist Ahmed al-Rifa'i [d. 1182]) in his early life, being initiated into the order at the hands of a particular Iraqi teacher. After a trip to Mecca, al-Badawi is said to have travelled to Iraq, \"where his sainthood [is believed to have] clearly manifested itself\" through the miracles he is said to have performed. Eventually, al-Badawi went to Tanta, Egypt, where settled for good in 1236. According to the various traditional biographies of the saint's life, al-Badawi gathered forty disciples around him during this period, who are collectively said to have \"dwelt on the city’s rooftop terraces,\" whence his spiritual order were informally named the \"roof men\" (\"aṣḥāb al-saṭḥ\") in the vernacular. Al-Badawi died in Tanta in 1276, being seventy-six years old.\n\nAs with every other major Sufi order, the Badawiyya proposes an unbroken spiritual chain of transmitted knowledge going back to the Prophet Muhammad through one of his Companions, which in the Badawiyya's case is Ali (d. 661).\n\n\n\n"}

It is the capital of the historic Catalan comarca of Vallespir.\n\nThe town lies in the foothills of the Pyrénées mountains, in southern France. It has an altitude of 175–1400 meters. It is located from the Autoroute A9, from Montpellier, from Toulouse and from Barcelona. It lies on the river Tech. The GR 10 footpath runs close by.\n\nCéret is located in the canton of Vallespir-Albères and in the arrondissement of Céret.\n\nThe name of the town in Catalan is \"Ceret\".\n\nFormer known names of Céret are, in order of appearance, \"vicus Sirisidum\" in 814, \"vico Cereto\" in 866, \"villa Cerseto\" in 915, \"vigo Ceresido\" in 930, also \"Cered\" and \"Ceriteto\" in the 10th century, \"Ceret\", \"Cericeto\" in the 11th and 12th centuries, \"Cirset\" around 1070, \"Cersed\" (one of the most common forms) in 1130 and \"Cerset\" in 1138, and from the 13th to 15th centuries \"Cereto\", \"Ceret\", \"Seret\" and \"Saret\". \"Ceret\" becomes the most common form around the 16th century.\n\nA plague epidemic hit Céret from 1651 to 1655 and killed about a hundred people. One of the doctors in charge, coming from Thuir, was fired for being repeatedly drunk and after having buried several sick people that were still alive.\n\nCéret is twinned with:\n\nThe region around Céret is a major fruit producer, in particular famed for its cherries.\n\nIn France since the 1920s, the first cherries of the season always come in march from the region of Céret, where the local producers always send, as a tradition since 1932, the first crate of cherries to the French president of the Republic. In 1938, 45000 out of the 90000 cherry trees of Pyrénées-Orientales are in the canton of Céret. The 25000 cherry trees in Céret only then give 1250 tons of cherries each year. In the 1960s, the production of cherries in Céret rises up to 3000 tons, before being divided by 11 at the end of the 2000s.\n\nThe \"Pont du Diable\" (Devil's Bridge) is a single arch stone bridge built between 1321 and 1341. With a single span of 45.45 m, it was at the time of its construction the world's largest arch bridge in terms of span length and remained so until 1356.\n\nThe church of Saint Peter is the main church in Céret and was built from the 11th to the 18th centuries.\n\nThe Château d'Aubiry is an Art Nouveau style château from the end of the 19th century built by rolling paper magnate Pierre Bardou-Job.\n\nThe War memorial was sculpted by Aristide Maillol and inaugurated in 1922.\n\nCéret is famous for its Musée d'Art Moderne (Museum of Modern Art), which has numerous Picasso paintings, sculptures and ceramics, including the famous bullfighting bowl series. The museum also features paintings by Chagall, Matisse, Herbin, Soutine, lots of Fauves and a few Impressionists. The top floor of the Museum hosts touring exhibitions. The museum is closed on Tuesdays.\n\nThe Museum of Musical Instruments, Céret opened in May 2013 and is hosting a unique collection of instruments and musical scores.\n\nCéret holds an annual festival for the corridas which run during three days. The first bullfighting with killing of the bull occurred in Céret in 1894 and has been a tradition ever since. This event is known as the \"feria\". There are also bull runnings where young bulls (usually with their horns blunted) are run through the streets corralled by a group of horsemen and women. People wearing traditional white and blue (the Céret colors) outfits, chase from behind in an attempt to catch hold of the bull's tail and hold on for as long as they can. The feria is always held the weekend nearest to 14 July, Bastille Day and around 30 to 40,000 people participate in the streets each year.\n\nCéret regularly holds communal dances, where local amateurs or professionals dance in a ring. The dance is known as the \"sardanes\". No pre-arrangement is made on the dancers behalf, locals note the time and place on posters around the city and turn up as they wish. More formal arrangements are also made on other occasions.\n\nCéret has a market on Saturdays, where vendors sell mostly local produce, along with sausages, olives, cheese and wine. During the summer, there is also a market each Tuesday night that focuses on arts and crafts rather than produce.\n\nCéret has a continued tradition of being a home for artists, especially painters and poets. Pablo Picasso lived in Céret in the early part of the 20th century and Café Pablo in the town is dedicated to him. The Grand Café, still operating today, was a meeting place for many famous artists in the early part of the last century. Henri Matisse and Amedeo Modigliani, amongst other artists, visited at this time. Chaim Soutine, the Russian emigre painter, lived in Céret for a period and painted many landscapes of the village and its surrounds. Aristide Maillol, a famous sculptor born in the local village of Banyuls-sur-Mer, is represented by two public sculptures - one outside the visitors information centre and the other on the war memorial. Harold Weston, the American modernist, lived in a farmhouse above Céret from 1926 to 1929.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A Swing style virtuoso, he played and recorded with many of the greats of Jazz, including Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman and Stephane Grappelli. He played publicly until 2010 when he had a blood clot, his career having spanned eight decades.\n\nAsmussen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, raised in a musical family, and started taking violin lessons at the age of 7. At age 16 he first heard recordings by jazz violin great Joe Venuti and began to emulate his style. He started working professionally as a violinist, vibraphonist, and singer at age 17, leaving his formal training behind for good. Early in his career he worked in Denmark and on cruise ships with artists such as Josephine Baker and Fats Waller. Asmussen later was greatly influenced by Stuff Smith, whom he met in Denmark. Asmussen played with Valdemar Eiberg and Kjeld Bonfils during World War II, during which time jazz had moved to the underground and served as a form of political protest.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Asmussen formed the trio Swe-Danes with singer Alice Babs and guitarist Ulrik Neumann. The group became very popular in Scandinavia for their music hall style entertainment and also toured the United States. Asmussen also worked with Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, and Duke Ellington. Asmussen was invited by Ellington to play on his \"Jazz Violin Session\" recording in 1963 with Stéphane Grappelli and Ray Nance.\n\nIn 1966 Asmussen appeared alongside Grappelli, Stuff Smith, and Jean-Luc Ponty in a jazz \"Violin Summit\" in Switzerland that was issued as a live recording. He made an appearance at the 1967 Monterey Jazz Festival, which included a celebrated violin summit with him, Ray Nance and Jean-Luc Ponty. In 1969 he guested on \"Snakes in a Hole,\" an album by the jazz-rock band Made in Sweden. He was still active playing violin at the age of 94.\n\nAsmussen became a centenarian on 28 February 2016.

{"id": "1809793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809793", "title": "Police 911", "text": "Police 911\n\nPolice 911, called in Japan and Police 24/7 in Europe, is a series of light gun shooter arcade games. Konami released the first game in 2000.\n\nUnlike earlier light gun games, the game was unique for its motion sensing technology, sensing body movement rather than requiring the player to move individual controls; the player's \"real world\" actions are reflected by the player character within the game. It also featured a unique cover system, where the player takes cover by physically ducking for cover rather than pressing a button. The 2001 Konami arcade game \"MoCap Boxing\" used similar motion-sensing technology.\n\nAlthough the game was a separate canon from the \"Lethal Enforcers\" series, Konami acknowledged \"Lethal Enforcers 3\" as the successor to the \"Police 911\" series, thus making it a canon in the \"Lethal Enforcers\" series.\n\nThe gameplay in \"Police 911\" can be considered more interactive than most light gun games; instead of merely standing in one place and shooting enemies before the player is shot, the game uses infrared sensors to determine a player's location; through this, the player is able to dodge around (with the knees, while standing on the pad), duck to avoid bullets (and reload), and lean out to maximize cover and get a better shot. This is not foolproof, however; enemies will continue to shoot while the player is hiding, so it is possible to be hit upon rising from cover. Also, like \"Time Crisis\", the timer is continually running down, so one cannot hide for very long.\n\nAs the player successfully completes each sub-part of a level, they gain a point towards a new rank. The higher a player's rank, the greater bonuses they can receive; growing time increments to start, followed by additional \"lives\", with the highest rank rewarding the player with 100 additional lives—however, considering that the timer continues to decrease whenever a player goes through their death animation, and that no additional time bonuses will be given after they reach that rank, this may be more of an oversight by the design team, or that the design team knows that there was no way for the player to use all those lives in one game because of the time. In addition, the player's rank reverts to the bottom whenever they get shot, so a potential strategy for a skilled player would be to ascend to the point where they gain a life, then immediately die so the time bonuses may be re-earned.\n\nHowever, if a player shoots civilians or fellow officers, it will deduct the rank; if it is lowered below a \"reward rank\", the reward will not be re-earned.\n\nThe ranks are as follows:\n\n\nThe first game of the series, called in Japan, was released in 2000. It casts the player as either a \"one man SWAT team\" working for the Tokyo police, or an American police officer of the LAPD, working to take down members of the , an internationally based yakuza group.\n\nAt test locations, before the game had an official title, the cabinet marquee read \"Hide From and Shoot the Chinese Mafia\".\n\nThe game was ported to the PlayStation 2 video game console in 2001.\n\nIn \"The Keisatsukan: Shinjuku Ni Juu Yon Ji\", the player begins on the streets of Kabuki-cho of Shinjuku, taking part in a raid on a nightclub owned by the Gokudo-kai; the officer, led by shielded riot squad members and surrounded by civilians (both whom the player must not shoot), can take different routes through the club as their shooting skill dictates. Once the players exit the club, they will be alerted that the suspects have scattered all over Japan to escape arrest, and arrest warrants have been issued for the 6 most wanted criminals in Shinjuku: , international weapon smuggler Richard Hansen, , , , and .\n\nThroughout the Mass Arrest Plan in Tokyo, it is determined that a number of fleeing suspects have fled to America; specifically, the Little Tokyo area in Los Angeles. The LAPD and FBI are notified, and an undercover detective is immediately dispatched to arrest remaining 3 fugitives to wrap up the mass arrest campaign.\n\nIn \"The Keisatsukan: Shinjuku Ni Juu Yon Ji\", a newspaper headline flashes on the screen whenever a civilian is shot, because he or she can actually be killed.\n\nIn \"Police 911/Police 24/7\", the gameplay missions are reversed: the raid on the nightclub takes place in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo, followed by a \"boss\" fight with Richard Hansen at the crowded intersection with textures and buildings being digital replicas of the actual buildings around Los Angeles' 1st St. and San Pedro St. The Highway Chase and the underground garage are next, followed by the encounter with Bai Ei Lee; this time, he is the only one in the truck. A new warehouse level follows this; the player must stop Noriko Nagata from completing the smuggling of weapons to Japan, while in the original version, Richard Hansen had already completed the operation.\n\nAt this point, it is determined that other fleeing suspects have returned to Japan; specifically, their base of operations in Kabuki-cho of Shinjuku. Tokyo's International Investigation Unit is contacted, and an undercover detective is immediately dispatched to arrest Matsuyama, Matsuoka, and Haraguchi at Ichibandai, Shinjuju Station Square, and the Shinjuku subway at the FBI's behalf.\n\nFinally, rather than showing a newspaper headline that civilians are killed on screen by the player as displayed in \"The Keisatsukan: Shinjuku Ni Juu Yon Ji\", the player simply loses a rank in \"Police 911/Police 24/7\" and is reminded not to shoot civilians or colleagues, but they are otherwise unharmed.\n\nOn release, \"Famitsu\" magazine scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 30 out of 40.\n\nThe second game, called in Japan, was released one year after the release of Police 911. The game takes place exclusively in Japan and players can choose 6 cities—Osaka, Hakata, Shinjuku, Kobe, Nagoya, and Sapporo. The first stage takes place in the scene of the crime and the following stage takes place in a shortened version of the usual city stage. The rest of the game takes place in normal stages before the player has to return to Osaka to arrest the remaining criminals.\n\nPolice 911 2 expands the original police officer role to four different characters. They can choose from a Tokyo police officer (male or female), a detective from the Metro Police, or a SAT (Special Assault Team) trooper, each carrying different handguns (5-round revolver, 8-round Glock, 12-round HK MP5). In the overseas version, the police woman and the detective are male and female American Interpol Operatives holding 8-round glocks.\n\nJapanese organized crimes are growing rapidly and rigidly as the Japanese government ordered a nationwide arrest plan (Senkoku Taitaiseki) throughout the whole nation to arrest all involved criminals. Criminal activity has increased by order of the infamous Gokudo-kai yakuza group, who has entered a partnership with a Hong Kong Triad called (\"Dragonhead\" in English). Finally, a mysterious kingpin is hiding behind-the-scenes to ensure that Japan falls down to the hands of the Gokudo-kai and the Ryuuto.\n\nPlayers start the investigation inside an office building where a collaboration deal is taking place between the Gokudo-kai and the Dragonheads. After arresting the first wave of criminals, nationwide arrest warrants have been issued for the capture of the following suspects holed in Osaka, Hakata, Shinjuku, Kobe, Nagoya, and Sapporo: , , , , Koji Motomura (sometimes mistranslated as Hiroshi Motomura; 本村 弘司 \"Motomura Koji\"), Sadaharu Kitaya (sometimes mistranslated as Sadaharu Kitadani; 北谷 貞治 \"Kitaya Sadaharu\"), and Hung Ko Cheung (熊 谷章). Arresting 3 behind-the-scene criminals throughout the game gives players a chance to capture the behind-the-scenes kingpin, \"Shigenobu Matsuyama\".\n\n"}

He was the BBC's first sports commentator and Arsenal's second longest serving manager.\n\nAllison was born in Hurworth-on-Tees, County Durham, and attended Holy Trinity School in Stockton. He started out as a judge's secretary in his native North East, while playing for a local amateur team in Stockton-on-Tees. Allison ran a sideline in writing about his own team's exploits, and he was eventually convinced by his editor to become a full-time journalist. A year in Devonport aside, Allison spent most of his time in the Cleveland and Middlesbrough areas, and was briefly assistant to the secretary-manager of Middlesbrough F.C.\n\nAllison moved to London in 1906, as the sports representative of the Hulton group of newspapers. Four years later he became greyhound correspondent for the \"Sporting Life\". After a chance encounter with Lord Kitchener before the 1911 coronation of King George V, Allison became London correspondent for the \"New York Post\" and a year later joined the staff of William Randolph Hearst, remaining in this post until 1934.\n\nDuring World War I Allison worked for the War Office and the Admiralty, producing propaganda and later joined the Royal Flying Corps (later renamed the Royal Air Force). After the war Allison also moved into broadcasting, joining the BBC and becoming the first person to commentate on the radio on events such as the Derby and the Grand National (with the BBC's racing correspondent Meyrick Good), as well as the annual England \"v.\" Scotland international, and the FA Cup Final in 1927, between Cardiff City and Arsenal. By this time, he had already formed a strong association with the latter club.\n\nHaving been a keen footballer in his youth (although he failed to make the grade as a professional, the best being a trial with Shildon), after his move to London in 1906, Allison soon became associated with Woolwich Arsenal. He became the club's programme editor and continued his association with the team after they moved to Highbury and renamed themselves \"Arsenal\". He became a member of the club's board of directors soon after the end of the First World War; he was at first club secretary and then managing director.\n\nAfter the sudden death of legendary Arsenal boss Herbert Chapman earlier in January 1934, Allison was appointed Chapman's full-time successor in the summer of that year. Under Chapman and caretaker manager Joe Shaw, Arsenal had already won the League Championship twice in a row, in 1932-33 and 1933-34, and Allison made it a hat-trick, winning a third successive title in 1934-35. He also won the FA Cup in 1935-36 and the League again in 1937-38.\n\nAllison famously appeared in a 1939 film set at Highbury, \"The Arsenal Stadium Mystery\", where he had a speaking part as himself. Amongst his lines included one uttered at half time: \"\"It's one-nil to the Arsenal. That's the way we like it.\"\", a line of which helped foster and create the club's famous one-nil to the Arsenal chant.\n\nAllison took a hands-off approach to managing, unlike his predecessor Chapman; Joe Shaw and Tom Whittaker took charge of training and squad discipline, while Allison concentrated on transfer policy and the club's relationship with the media. Arsenal player Bernard Joy later recounted: \"[He was] tactful, friendly and good-hearted. But he fell short in his handling of footballers and lacked the professional's deep knowledge of the game\". Allison's proponents have cited the trophies won under his reign, though by the end of the 1930s Arsenal were no longer the all-conquering team that they had once been. Allison was unable to replace many of the stars from the first half of the decade, especially Alex James.\n\nWith the advent of the Second World War, official competition in England was suspended; after hostilities had ended, many of the players that had made Arsenal a success (such as Cliff Bastin and Ted Drake) had retired from playing. Arsenal finished a disappointing 13th in 1946-47, and Allison, by now in his mid-sixties and tiring of managerial life, decided to step down and retire from the game. He died in 1957 after several years of illness.\n\nAllison married Ethel Swordy in 1912.\n\nArsenal\n\n"}

It is located on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River and is the county seat. The village is located off the Trans-Canada Highway, Autoroute 20. Route 132 passes through the town.\n\nIt is known for its craftspeople and artists, especially in the fields of wood carving and sculpture. There are also several well-reputed restaurants.\n\nThe village takes its name from the seigneury of Port-Joly, which was established in 1677. The Parish of St-Jean-Port-Joli was canonically established in 1721. The church, on which construction began in 1779, has unique architecture and houses many sculptures. The municipality was created in 1845 and became part of L'Islet County (a predecessor to the RCM of L'Islet) in 1847. In 1855, it became a parish municipality, and in 1857 it was split into the municipalities of St-Jean-Port-Joli and Saint-Aubert.\n\nLike most other villages that lie in the Côte-du-Sud region between Rivière-Ouelle and Beaumont, most of its houses were burned down in September 1759. Under the orders of British general James Wolfe, the Fraser Highlanders regiment attacked the area during the Conquest of 1760 during the French and Indian War.\n\nThe tradition of wood carving began in the early 20th century with the Bourgault brothers, Médard, Jean-Julien and André.\n\nDespite its small population, the village is a relatively active tourist stop in the region, primarily due to the abundance of artesian wood carvers and cultural events. The village also includes a marina with access to the Saint Lawrence River at the site of the old wharf.\n\nSt-Jean-Port-Joli was awarded with the title of cultural capital of Canada in 2005.\n\nThis festival highlights many aspects of the village's maritime heritage, legends, and songs. Also included in the weekend-long event is a dinner, workshops, literary contest, sailboat race, market, films, and expositions.\n\nThis is an annual festival of music that has taken place since 1998. Every year in the month of September, fiddlers gather and play music from a wide variety of genres.\n\nIn the month of February, the Trois-Bérets park invites ice sculptors from around the world to display their talent.

It is native to Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam) and the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, but has also been found in the Philippines. The plant is a medium-sized slender shrub that can reach in height, and is often unbranched. The root of the plant has been used in folk medicine of the South East Asian region, and in modern times has common use as supplements, as well as food and drink additives. There is no clinical data supporting the effectiveness of \"Eurycoma longifolia\" for any health benefit.\n\n\"Eurycoma longifolia\" is also known by the common names \"penawar pahit\", \"penawar bias\", \"bedara merah\", \"bedara putih\", \"lempedu pahit\", \"payong ali\", \"tongkat baginda\", \"muntah bumi\", \"petala bumi\" (all Malay); Malaysian ginseng; \"bidara laut\" (Indonesian); \"babi kurus\" (Javanese); \"cây bá bệnh\" (Vietnamese); \"tho nan\" (Laotian); \"lan-don\", \"hae phan chan\", \"phiak\", \"plaa lai phuenk\", \"tung saw\" (all Thai); \"long jack\" (US); \"langir siam\" (Bahrain). Many of the common names refer to the plant's medicinal use and extreme bitterness. \"Penawar pahit\" translates simply as \"bitter charm\" or \"bitter medicine\". Older literature, such as a 1953 article in the \"Journal of Ecology\", may cite only \"penawar pahit\" as the plant's common Malay name.\n\nAs mentioned above, \"E. longifolia\" is known by common names \"tongkat ali\" and \"pasak bumi\" in the South East Asian region, but these names are also used for the physiologically similar species \"Polyalthia bullata\". The bark and root of \"E. longifolia\" is more white/yellow-ish compared to the darker-colored \"P. bullata\", which has led to the former being known as \"tongkat ali/pasak bumi putih\" or \"tongkat ali/pasak bumi kuning\", and the latter as \"tongkat ali/pasak bumi hitam\". (\"Putih\" means \"white\", \"kuning\" means \"yellow\", and \"hitam\" means \"black\" in Malay/Indonesian.) Indonesia also has a red-coloured variety known as \"tongkat ali/pasak bumi merah\" (\"merah\" meaning \"red\"), which is being studied by researchers and has not had its species classified.\n\nA medium size slender shrub reaching , often unbranched with reddish brown petioles. Leaves compound, even pinnate reaching meter in length. Each compound leaf consists of 30 to 40 leaflets, lanceolate to obovate-lanceolate. Each leaflet is about long, wide, and much paler on the ventral side.\n\nInflorecense axillary, in large brownish red panicle, very pubescent with very fine, soft, granular trichomes. Flowers are dioecious. Petals are small, very fine pubescent. Drupe hard, ovoid, yellowish brown when young and brownish red when ripe. The plant grows in the understorey of lowland forests, and survives on a variety of soils but prefers acidic, well-drained soil.\n\nMany purported health benefits have been attributed to \"Eurycoma longifolia\"; however, there is no clinical data supporting its effectiveness for any health benefit. The plant is used in the traditional medicine of Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. In Indonesia and Malaysia, the root of the plant is boiled in water, and the water is consumed as a health tonic for post-partum recovery, as an aphrodisiac, as well as the relief of fever, intestinal worms, dysentery, diarrhea, indigestion, and jaundice. In Vietnam, the flower and fruits are used to treat dysentery, and the root is used for malaria and fever. In Malaysia, a paste of the plant is applied topically to relieve headaches and stomach-aches. There is a traditional belief that \"E. longifolia\" is an aphrodisiac. Other health benefits attributed to this plant include antimalarial, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antipyretic, anti-dengue and immunomodulation activities. In Indonesia and Malaysia, \"E. longifolia\" has been widely commercialized. Its root, which is highly bitter, has been used as the basis for supplements, as well as food and drink additives. In the US, the extract has self-affirmed generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status, as an ingredient. As a supplement, it has been marketed for the supposed benefits of sexual health improvement, as an energy and stamina booster, for improving blood circulation, and fat reduction. In the drinks market, it is a common ingredient for coffee and beverages marketed as energy drinks.\n\nThere have been a number of cases of products falsely claiming to contain \"E. longifolia\" as an ingredient, as well as \"E. longifolia\" product contamination cases. In 2006 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned seven dietary supplement products that claimed to include \"E. longifolia\" as a principal ingredient, but which additionally contained prescription drugs and even analogues of prescription drugs that have not yet been tested for safety in humans, such as acetildenafil.\n\nIn 2017, the FDA announced that two different brands of \"E. longifolia\"-containing coffee were recalled after being found to be adulterated with active ingredients from erectile dysfunction drugs.\n\nIn Malaysia, there are over 200 registered \"E. longifolia\" products. However, a 2004 study determined, following quality testing, that 36% of these were contaminated with mercury beyond legally permitted limits.\n\nProducts stating various \"E. longifolia\" extract ratios of \"1:50, 1:100, and 1:200\" are common on the market. However extracts based on this ratio system are often misleading and hard to verify. Scientific research done on herbal products in general indicates that in many cases the content of bioactive constituents varies between products. One perception is that a higher extraction ratio indicates a stronger product, but higher extract ratio just means that more of the original material was removed.\n\nAnother option is for extraction techniques to utilize standardization methods to monitor the bioactive content and quality of the extract against standardization markers. Among standardization markers that have been used for \"E. longifolia\" are eurycomanone, total protein, total polysaccharide and glycosaponin, which have been recommended in a technical guideline developed by the Scientific and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM).\n\nAn extract process and method of treatment for sexual dysfunction and male infertility was issued a U.S. patent in 2006, with subsequent international filings in the EU and Japan. Additional patent applications have been filed in the U.S. for various processes and indications, but as of August 2017 none have resulted in issued patents. Three of the applications. A protest has been made against patenting \"E. longifolia\" due to its being a natural product with widely-known traditional use, though comments have been made that said patent only covers a specific extraction process instead of the plant itself. One of the patent licensees, Biotropics, has clarified that the patent does not claim the plant itself nor \"traditional knowledge\" over the plant, but on \"new scientific uses\" relating to the plant.\n\n\"E. longifolia\" is mainly used for its roots, which necessitates uprooting the entire plant when it is harvested. This has led to concerns over the long-term sustainability of its use.\n\nIn Malaysia raw \"E. longifolia\" is banned from export, and the plant itself been listed as one of the priority medicinal species for conservation, and the harvesting of wild trees is restricted according to Act 686 on International Trade in Endangered Species. In 2016, Ahmad Shabery Cheek, the Malaysian Minister of Agriculture, said that the species may go extinct within twenty years if cultivation and replanting efforts are not made quickly. Despite this, the Malaysian government has encouraged the commercialization of high-value herbal products based on this plant, notably in its 2010 Economic Transformation Programme, where Tongkat Ali is listed among the top five herbs to be developed on a large scale until the year 2020. To support this commercialization, the Malaysian government made attempts to encourage the long-term commercial cultivation of the plant, through the provision of grants for farmers, enabling agronomy research by MARDI, and the formation of cluster farms under the East Coast Economic Region.\n\n\"Eurycoma longifolia\" has been reported to contain the glycoprotein compounds eurycomanol, eurycomanone, and eurycomalactone.\n\n"}
{"id": "1809813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809813", "title": "Metalation", "text": "Metalation\n\nMetalation (Alt. spelling: Metallation) is a chemical reaction which involves the bonding of a metal atom to what is typically an organic molecule to form a new compound. This reaction usually involves the replacement of a halogen atom in an organic molecule with a metal atom to form an organometallic compound. In the laboratory, metalation is commonly used to activate organic molecules during the formation of C—X bonds (where X is typically Carbon, Oxygen, or Nitrogen), which are necessary for the synthesis of many organic molecules.\n\nIn synthesis, metallated reagents are typically involved in nucleophilic substitution, single-electron-transfer (SET), and redox chemistry with functional groups on other molecules (including but not limited to ketones, aldehydes, and alkyl halides). Metallated molecules may also participate in acid-base chemistry, with one organometallic reagent deprotonating an organic molecule to create a new organometallic reagent.\n\nThe most common classes of metallated compounds are organolithium reagents and Grignard reagents. However, other organometallic compounds — such as organozinc compounds — also experience common use in both laboratory and industrial applications.\n\nMetalation was first observed in the laboratory by Edward Frankland during a synthesis of diethylzinc in 1849. While this development eventually led to the development of organometallic compounds of other metals, these compounds saw little use in the laboratory because of their expense and (in the case of organozinc compounds) their highly pyrophoric nature. Metalation reactions (particularly in the form of transmetalation) only began to see more widespread use in synthetic laboratories after François Auguste Victor Grignard’s synthesized organomagnesium halides directly from metallic magnesium and organic halides. These newfound organomagnesium reagents' extreme versatility in organic synthesis caused metalation to see widespread use in laboratory science. Organolithium reagents were synthesized for the first time in 1917 by Schlenk and Holtz, though these reagents did not see widespread use as metallating agents or reagents in organic synthesis until Karl Ziegler, Henry Gilman, and Georg Wittig — among others — developed synthetic methods that improved upon this initial synthesis. After these improvements in synthesis came to be known, interest in the compounds increased significantly, as they are generally more reactive than organomagnesium compounds. The first use of an organolithium reagent as a metalation reagent occurred in 1928, with Schlenk and Bergmann's metalation of fluorene with ethyllithium.\n\nMost simple metallated compounds are commercially available in both the solid and solution phases, with solution phase metallated compounds available in a wide range of solvents and concentrations. These compounds may also be created in the laboratory as an \"in situ\" synthetic intermediate or separately in solution.\n\nThe large difference in electronegativity between the carbon atom and metal atoms in most metallated compounds causes the resultant Carbon—Metal bond to be highly polar. The high polarity of the bond — and the resultantly high electron density around the metallated carbon atom — causes the bond's electronic character to strongly resemble that of an ionic bond. This makes metallated reagents generally good nucleophiles, and strong bases.\n\nMetallated compounds are most commonly used in organic synthesis, where they act as nucleophiles in nucleophilic substitution reactions, strong bases in deprotonation reactions, initiators in polymerization reactions, and starting materials for the creation of other metallated compounds in transmetalation reactions.\n\nSterically hindered metallated compounds, such as n-Butyllithium complexes, are often used as superbases or polymerization initiators because their steric bulk hinders the compound's ability to approach nucleophiles at a distance short enough for nucleophilic attack. Metallated compounds without a high degree of steric bulk, such as methyllithium or alkyl magnesium halides, are more commonly used as nucleophiles or transmetallation reagents — though these compounds' high basicity often requires the protection of basic functional groups found on organic molecules.\n\nMetalation is commonly used to synthesize complex organometallic reagents, such as alkynylithium reagents, from complex hydrocarbon molecules that possess acidic hydrogens. For both intermolecular and Intramolecular metalation, the reaction occurs via the acid-base functionalization of the C-H bond by a Metal (M) — Base (B) pair according to the general scheme below.\n\n<chem title=\"Metal-Base promoted C-H bond functionalization\">{M-B} + R-H <=> {M-R} + B-H</chem>\n\nThe relative stability of the final products of this reaction determines whether or not this reaction is reversible, while the relative acidity of the C-H bonds present in the metallated molecule will determine the metalation location of the newly formed organometallic reagent.\n\nMetalation was first proposed to follow a Concerted Metalation-Deprotonation (CMD) mechanism by Winstein and Traylor in 1955, postulating such on the basis of mercury's electrophilicity during the acetolysis of diphenylmercury in acetic acid. Later mechanistic studies support the existence of this mechanism for both intermolecular and intramolecular metalation reactions generating organometallic compounds. The commonly accepted mechanism is depicted below, with the metalation of a primary hydrogen given as an example.\n\nTransmetalation involves the exchange of two metals between organic molecules by a redox exchange mechanism. For example, transmetalations often form a reaction between an organolithium reagent and a metal salt.\n\nWhen synthesizing simple organolithium reagents, the reduction of one equivalent of a simple alkyl or aryl halide with two equivalents of Lithium metal produces one equivalent of a simple alkyl- or aryl-lithium and one equivalent of lithium halide with good yield.\n\n<chem title=\"Reduction with metal lithium\">{R-X} + 2Li -> {R-Li} + Li-X</chem>\n\nThis reaction is known to proceed via a radical pathway that is likely initiated through a single-electron-transfer mechanism of the type shown below.\n\nMagnesium similarly metalates organohalides to give Grignard reagents.\n"}

Written by Ciara and Missy Elliott and produced by Jazze Pha, it was released as the album's second single in 2004 in the United States and the second quarter of 2005 internationally. It peaked within the top ten of the charts in several countries worldwide, including Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song is heavily inspired by 1980s electro music production. Throughout the song, Ciara gives a description of how the song's beat feels as she exhorts party-goers to dance to the music. \"1, 2 Step\" was ranked 59th on \"Billboard\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top 100 Songs of the 2000s. In the United States, the song peaked at number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and stayed there for seven weeks.\n\nThe song also features Missy Elliott using an interpolation verse from Teena Marie's song \"Square Biz\".\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" is one of four songs Ciara and Jazze Pha originally recorded at Doppler Studios in Atlanta two years before the release of \"Goodies\". It's said that Ciara was inspired by Roscoe Blunt, leading to the creation of this song. \"The two connected so well, that half of the album was made within eight days or so.\" Pha asked Missy Elliott to appear on the track and she accepted. Elliott recorded her rap verse at the Hit Factory Criteria in Miami.\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" is a Crunk&B track, which is strongly influenced by 1980s electro music. The song was created on one of Jazze Pha's five Akai MPC3000s. Pha used laser pulses from E-mu Proteus 2000s that were used for old school hip hop songs and b-boy break dance tracks. \"1, 2 Step\" is inspired by Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock.\" Jazze Pha thought about how he could create a more melodic version and \"shared some interesting ideas on what kind of music he would like to produce with her. Let's put it this way, it would be epic.\" \"1, 2 Step\" references Ciara's song \"Goodies\" and \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen.\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" received favorable reviews from music critics. \"Contact Music\" gave the song three out of five stars and called it \"arse shaking floor filling R&B\" and a \"wicked melodic souful twist.\" Jason Birchmeier of \"Allmusic\" was published that the track is \"good, if not great.\" Gerardo E. wrote it's \"a feel good track,\" something that is not overproduced but works its magic.\" Kate Watkins of \"The Situation\" called it \"a funky song in the style we have come to expect from Missy.\" \"Fazed\" stated that the song is about \"joys of dancing around with family.\" \"Slant\" thought that \"1, 2 Step\" was a \"fun dance track.\"\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" was nominated for the 2006 Grammy Award for \"Best Rap/Sung Collaboration,\" but lost to \"Numb/Encore\" by Jay-Z and Linkin Park. The song also received a nomination at the Soul Train Lady of Soul Music Awards for \"Best Dance Cut.\" The song was nominated for \"Viewer's Choice\" at the 2005 BET Awards, but lost to Omarion's \"O.\" The song won the award \"Best Performed Songs in the ASCAP Repertory for the 2005 Survey Year,\" which included the title track from the album as well as third single, \"Oh.\" The song won the award for \"Choice Music R&B/Hip Hop Track\" at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards and \"Best Collaboration\" and \"Viewer's Choice\" at the BET Awards in 2005.\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" debuted at number 74 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In the January 8, 2005, issue of \"Billboard\", the song climbed to number two on the chart and stayed there for seven weeks, while being held from the top slot by Mario's \"Let Me Love You\" and became Ciara's second top-ten single. \"1, 2 Step\" reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Pop 100 (the first on the then new chart), Hot Dance Airplay, Hot Digital Tracks, and Top 40 Mainstream charts. It also peaked in the top five on the Hot Digital Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Rhythmic Airplay and the Top 40 Tracks charts, and the top thirty on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. \"1, 2 Step\" was ranked at number five for the year on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2005.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, \"1, 2 Step\" entered and peaked at number three on both the UK Singles Chart and Irish Singles Chart respectively. In Ireland, the single stayed at three for three weeks. The song reached number two in Australia for one week and New Zealand for two weeks. It peaked at number five in China and was a top thirty hit in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\nThe music video for \"1, 2 Step\" was directed by Benny Boom. It takes place in an Atlanta skating rink and on the streets. R&B boy band, B5, makes a short appearance in the video, along with Lloyd and Lil Scrappy. Ciara can be seen teaching others the song's title \"one, two step\" dance, which is similar to the traditional grapevine.\n\nThe video begins, with Ciara inserting her \"Goodies\" CD in a radio, setting it to the \"1, 2 Step\" track, and pressing play. As the song begins, you see Jazze Pha reciting the introduction, showing Elliott, and then finally Ciara herself. We see Ciara and her dancers, dancing in the Atlanta skating Rink, and certain shots of her teaching her female friend the \"1, 2 Step\". We then see a clip of Ciara meeting up with B5 and performing the 1, 2 Step. Later Ciara is seen dancing alone on the streets. While dancing in the skating rink, she looks behind her, and sees Elliott in the mirror, but thinks she is just seeing things. Then Elliott begins to rap her verse and they continue dancing with each other in front of the mirror, until the songs ends. During this time, we also see shots of Ciara teaching a group of young girls the dance and also, she meets a boy who is standing in front of his house and kind of gives him a flirtatious look.

In the years since he has remained active on the political scene, while also acting as a diplomat and mediator in regional crises.\n\nDramé was born in Nioro du Sahel. He studied at the Ecole Normale Supérieure of Bamako before obtaining his Advanced studies diploma (French: \"Diplôme d'études avancées\", DEA, an advanced pre-doctoral degree) in African history from the University of Paris (I). His political activity began during his studies.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1980, he was one of leaders of the Malian National Students' Union (\"Union Nationale des Elèves et Etudiants du Mali\", UNEEM), which opposed Moussa Traoré's regime in Mali. Dramé was imprisoned on several occasions for his opposition to the regime. He then went into exile in Europe, where he worked for Amnesty International from 1988 to 1991. He conducted surveys on the human rights situation in West Africa. A militant for the Malian National Congress for Democratic Initiative (\"Congrès national d’initiative démocratique\", CNID), Dramé returned to Mali when Amadou Toumani Touré toppled Traoré's regime in 1991. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs in the transitional government from 1991 to 1992.\n\nIn 1995, he was a consultant for the United Nations to prepare a human rights survey operation in Burundi. That same year, in disagreement with Mountaga Tall, founder of the CNID, he left the party with other militants to found the Party for National Renaissance (\"Parti pour la renaissance nationale\", PARENA), of which he was elected Secretary-General. In 1996, he was appointed as Minister of Arid and Semi-Arid Zones in Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta's government.\n\nHe was elected to the National Assembly as a Deputy from Nioro du Sahel in 1997. In November 1999, he became President of PARENA. In 2001, he was elected as President of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA).\n\nHe ran in the April 2002 presidential election and obtained 3.99% of the votes, taking fourth place.

The land was taken in 1790. It was returned, after many stages of federal and state approval, in March 1847.\n\nExactly straddling the Potomac was designated by the 1790 Residence Act as the District of Columbia, ceded by the states of Maryland and Virginia. The portion west of the Potomac, ceded by Virginia, consisted of in two parts: the city of Alexandria, Virginia, at the extreme southern shore, and its rural hinterland, short-lived Alexandria County, D.C. After decades of debate about the disenfranchisement that came with District citizenship, and tensions related to Alexandria's lucrative slave trade, this portion of the District was returned to Virginia in 1846–47. The remaining District assumed its current boundaries and area of east of the Potomac and 0.19 square miles (0.49 km²) of land on the west side of the Potomac River on Columbia Island.\n\nTwenty-first-century proposals to return the remaining portion of the District of Columbia to the state of Maryland are cited as one way to provide full voting representation in Congress and return local control of the District to its residents.\n\nThe Organic Act of 1801 organized the District of Columbia and placed the federal territory under the exclusive control of Congress. The District was organized into two counties, Washington on the east side of the Potomac River, and Alexandria on the west side. Following this Act, citizens located in the District were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, thus ending their representation in Congress.\n\nAlmost immediately after the Organic Act of 1801, Congress took up proposals for the return of the territory to the states, all of which failed. Members of Congress proposed retrocession because they found disenfranchisement of the District's residents to be unacceptable. Other Congressmen were of the opinion that the District could not be immediately returned without the consent of the residents and the legislatures of Maryland and Virginia. Some representatives rejected the idea of retrocession entirely and concluded that the Congress lacked the constitutional authority to return the territory.\n\nIn the 1830s, efforts grew to reunite the southern portion of the District with Virginia. Besides the fact that District residents had lost representation in Congress, a number of additional factors aided the movement to return the area to Virginia:\n\nOne argument against retrocession was that the federal government did in fact use Alexandria: as a military outpost, signal corps site, and cemetery.\n\nFrom 1840 to 1846, Alexandrians petitioned Congress and the Virginian legislature to approve retrocession. On February 2, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly agreed to accept the retrocession of Alexandria if Congress approved.\n\nFollowing additional lobbying by Alexandrians, the 29th Congress passed legislation on July 9, 1846, to return all the District's territory south of the Potomac River to the Commonwealth of Virginia, pursuant to a referendum; President James K. Polk signed the legislation the next day.\n\nA referendum on retrocession was held on September 1–2, 1846. The residents of the city of Alexandria voted in favor of the retrocession, 763 to 222; however, the residents of Alexandria County voted against retrocession 106 to 29. Despite the objections of those living in Alexandria County, President Polk certified the referendum and issued a proclamation of transfer on September 7, 1846.\n\nThe Virginia legislature, however, did not immediately accept the retrocession offer. Virginia legislators were concerned that the people of Alexandria County had not been properly included in the retrocession proceedings. After months of debate, the Virginia General Assembly voted to formally accept the retrocession legislation on March 13, 1847.\n\nConfirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the District, although not slavery itself.\n\nAt the start of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln attempted to have the Virginia portion re-annexed over security concerns, but this idea was rejected by the Senate.\n\nThe constitutionality of the retrocession has been called into question. The contract clause found in Article One of the United States Constitution prohibits states from breaching contracts to which they are themselves a party. By annexing Alexandria in 1847, Virginia may have breached its contractual obligation to \"forever cede and relinquish\" the territory for use as the permanent seat of the United States government. President William Howard Taft also believed the retrocession to be unconstitutional and tried to have the land given back to the District.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has never issued a firm opinion on whether the retrocession of the Virginia portion of the District of Columbia was constitutional. In the 1875 case of \"Phillips v. Payne\" the Supreme Court held that Virginia had \"de facto\" jurisdiction over the area returned by Congress in 1847, and dismissed the tax case brought by the plaintiff. The court, however, did not rule on the core constitutional matter of the retrocession. Writing the majority opinion, Justice Noah Haynes Swayne stated only that:\nThe plaintiff in error is estopped from raising the point which he seeks to have decided. He cannot, under the circumstances, vicariously raise a question, nor force upon the parties to the compact an issue which neither of them desires to make.\n\nIn order to grant the residents of the District of Columbia voting representation and control over their local affairs, some members of Congress, such as Rep. Dan Lungren, have proposed returning most parts of the city to Maryland. These proposals go back at least as far as 1839, when some members of Congress proposed retrocession of the portion of the District west of Rock Creek to Maryland. In recent years since at least 2001, several failed attempts, mostly supported by Republicans, have been made to return most of the District to Maryland and give them full voting rights: & , both sponsored by Rep. Ralph Regula (R-OH); and , , and , all sponsored by Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX). The proposals received little support from congressional Democrats.\n\nIf both the Congress and the Maryland state legislature agreed, jurisdiction over the District of Columbia could be returned to Maryland, excluding a small tract of land immediately surrounding the United States Capitol, the White House and the Supreme Court building which would become known as the \"National Capital Service Area\". The idea to retrocede all but the federal lands to Maryland dates back to at least 1848.\n\nOne problem with retrocession is that the state of Maryland may not want to take the District back. In the opinion of former Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, discussing the matter in 1998, retroceding the District to Maryland without that state's consent may require a constitutional amendment.\n\nA second problem is that the Twenty-third Amendment, ratified in 1961, grants \"[t]he District constituting the seat of Government of the United States\" the right to appoint electors to vote for president. At least one bill proposed in Congress specifically tied retrocession to the Twenty-third Amendment's repeal. If the Twenty-third Amendment were \"not\" repealed, it is possible that the remaining portion of the District (the National Capital Service Area) would still be entitled to select three presidential electors.\n\nAn alternative proposal to retrocession was the District of Columbia Voting Rights Restoration Act of 2004 (H.R. 3709), which would have treated the residents of the District as residents of Maryland for the purposes of Congressional representation. Maryland's congressional delegation would then have been apportioned accordingly to include the population of the District. Those in favor of such a plan argued that the Congress already has the necessary authority to pass such legislation without the constitutional concerns of other proposed remedies. From the foundation of the District in 1790 until the passage of the Organic Act of 1801, citizens living in D.C. continued to vote for members of Congress in Maryland or Virginia; legal scholars therefore propose that the Congress has the power to restore those voting rights while maintaining the integrity of the federal district. The proposed legislation, however, never made it out of committee.\n\nMost residents of Maryland and District of Columbia do not support retrocession. A 1994 study showed that only 25% of suburban residents polled endorsed retrocession to Maryland, and that number dropped to 19% among District residents. District residents' dislike was confirmed in a 2000 George Washington University study when only 21% of those polled supported the option of retrocession. A 2016 poll of Maryland residents showed that only 28% supported annexing District of Columbia while 44% were opposed.\n\nMaryland's senators, both Democrats, co-sponsored a September 2014 D.C. statehood bill. Republicans are thought to oppose statehood over retrocession, as it would most likely add two safe Democratic seats to the United States Senate. Historically, District voters have been overwhelmingly voting for Democratic candidate with over 80% of the votes going to the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1984. Neither statehood nor retrocession is generally seen as a legislative priority by either party.\n\n\n"}

He grew up near Washington D.C. and, after graduation from Western High School there, was appointed midshipman on June 29, 1903, and graduated from the Naval Academy with the class of 1907, in the advanced section of that class, on September 12, 1906. Assigned to \"Indiana\" (Battleship No. 1), he landed from that ship at Kingston, Jamaica, in January 1907 and was cited by his commanding officer for his efficient work in a rescue party during fires resulting from an earthquake there.\n\nWilliamson later joined \"Kansas\" (Battleship No. 21) and made the globe-girdling cruise of the Great White Fleet (1907–1908) before he was ordered to Washington, D.C., in March 1909 for \"ordnance instruction\". From there, he went to \"Utah\" (Battleship No. 31) in October 1911. While in that dreadnought, he commanded the gun battery of \"Utah's\" landing force during the landings at Veracruz, Mexico, in April 1914.\n\nWiliamson inspected ordnance at the E. W. Bliss and Co., Brooklyn, New York, from 1914 to 1916 before he joined \"Galveston\" (Cruiser No. 17) on May 13, 1916, for a brief tour of duty. He then journeyed to the Asiatic Station to become the Inspector of Ordnance and Powder at the Naval Magazine and Chemical Laboratory in Olongapo in the Philippines (later called the Naval Ammunition Depot, Olongapo) on July 7, 1916.\n\nReturning to the United States in the spring of 1918, he was assigned duty assisting in the fitting out of and became the ship's first executive officer when that transport was commissioned. Williamson then worked closely with the ship's commanding officer, Captain R. Drace White—another ordnance expert—in developing a workable depth-charge thrower for use on board transports, in the hope of providing them with some measure of protection of their own. Wiliamson's invention was a modified Lyle gun (one used for line-throwing in rescue operations). In the first test on August 16, 1918, the crude depth-charge projector hurled a 50-pound charge approximately 150 feet.\n\nHowever, before using their creation in actual operations against submarines trailing her convoy, the two officers wanted at least one more test with a larger propellant charge. Accordingly, on August 17, 1918, they commenced another experiment—which proved to be a disaster.\n\nWilliamson fired the gun, but a defective fuse caused the depth charge to explode prematurely, killing him instantly. The blast knocked Capt. White to the deck (with a broken jaw, broken knee, and flesh wounds), and killed three sailors. In addition, four other officers and 22 other enlisted men were wounded in the tragic explosion. For his work, however, Williamson was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously.\n\nWilliam Price Williamson was the grandson of Confederate Chief Engineer William Price Williamson of North Carolina. Confederate Chief Engineer Williamson has been credited with first suggesting that the hull of the could be used to build the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia.

He was a military leader who fought in the Napoleonic Wars and achieved the rank of lieutenant general; he is noted in present-day Serbia, where he led a combined Russian and Serb army to defeat the Turks at Varvarin in 1810.\n\nO'Rourke was awarded the orders of Saint George, Alexander Nevsky, and Saint Anne for his military victories. His portrait was included in the Military Gallery of the Winter Palace, now part of the Hermitage Museum. A monument commemorating O'Rourke and his men was erected in Varvarin in 1910 on the centennial celebration of their victory against the Turks.\n\nThe O'Rourke family were originally members of the Jacobite Irish Nobility; they fled Ireland after the defeat by the Protestant Williamites at the Battle of the Boyne in 1691. The majority of the family moved as refugees to France during this time. The O'Rourkes were a prominent Gaelic aristocratic family who lost lands in the Elizabethan and Cromwellian conquests, and several family members emigrated to Russia. The family members were descendants of ninth-century kings of Connacht and ruled the ancient kingdom of Breifne in the northwest of the country until they were unseated during the Elizabethan conquest in the sixteenth century.\n\nDuring the reign of Elizabeth in Russia in the eighteenth century, one branch of the O'Rourkes moved to Livonia, a province of the Russian Empire at the time. Joseph Cornelius O'Rourke was born in Dorpat in 1772. By this time, the family had intermarried and had been completely absorbed into Russian high society. According to the custom of his class, O'Rourke was immediately enrolled at birth in the Russian Imperial Guard. His father was Count Cornelius O'Rourke, who retired in 1788 with the rank of Major-General.\n\nAfter education in a military school and military training, he first saw action as a young man in Zürich against the French Revolutionary Army. He served under General Kutuzov in 1805 at the Battle of Austerlitz and was awarded the Order of Saint George.\n\nAfter Napoleon invaded Russia and reached Moscow, O'Rourke took part in the defense and defeat of the French at Leipzig, and he was awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky.\nFor his exploits in the 1813–14 campaign, O'Rourke was awarded the Prussian Iron Cross,\nthe Order of the Red Eagle, and the Swedish Order of the Sword. His portrait hangs in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. In 1910, a monument was erected to him in Serbia. During his illustrious career, he received two golden swords for bravery, one of which was encrusted with diamonds.\n\nO'Rourke held a vast estate near Minsk, which was worked on by one thousand serfs. He married and had children, among them six sons.\n\nOne son, Michael O'Rourke, entered the marine corps as a cadet and achieved distinction in the Navy in the 15th complement, becoming a lieutenant by 1849.\n\nA later descendant joined Catholic orders and became bishop of Danzig after World War I.\nBetween 1809 and 1812, O'Rourke served in the war against the Turks. When the Turks threatened the southern edge of the empire, O'Rourke equipped a regiment at his own expense and marched to Serbia to fight against the Ottoman Empire. He and his men fought for the deliverance of Prahovo, Bela Palanka, Sokobanja and Jasika, and they won a decisive victory at Varvarin. O'Rourke helped free the area from domination by the Turks and was awarded the Order of Saint Anne for his service.\n\nO'Rourke concluded his military career as a lieutenant general, and he fought French forces again in Germany.

Allegro\n\nJohn Marco Allegro (17 February 1923 – 17 February 1988) was an English archaeologist and Dead Sea Scrolls scholar. He was a populariser of the Dead Sea Scrolls through his books and radio broadcasts. He was the editor of some of the most famous and controversial scrolls published, the \"pesharim\". A number of Allegro's later books, including \"The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross\", brought him both popular fame and notoriety, and also destroyed his career.\n\nAllegro went through grammar school in 1939. He joined the Royal Navy, serving during World War Two. After the war he began training for the Methodist ministry, but found that he was more interested in Hebrew and Greek, so he went to study at Manchester University with fees paid by government grant due to his military service. Allegro received his Honours degree in Oriental Studies at the University of Manchester in 1951. This was followed in 1952 by a masters degree under supervision of H. H. Rowley. While engaged in further research in Hebrew dialects at Oxford under Godfrey Driver in 1953, Allegro was invited by Gerald Lankester Harding to join the team of scholars working on the Dead Sea Scrolls in Jerusalem, where he spent one year working on the scrolls. He became a lecturer in Comparative Semitic Philology in Manchester in 1954.\n\nIt was on Allegro's recommendation in 1955 that the Copper Scroll was sent by the Jordanian government to Manchester University in order for it to be cut into sections, allowing the text to be read. He was present during the cutting process in 1956 and later made a preliminary transcription of the text, which he soon translated, sending copies of his work back to Gerald Lankester Harding in Jordan. Although Allegro had been first to translate the Copper Scroll, the text was assigned for editing to J.T. Milik by Roland de Vaux, the editor in chief of the scrolls. While he was in England he made a series of radio broadcasts on BBC Radio aimed at popularising the scrolls, in which he announced that the leader discussed in the scrolls may have been crucified. He posited that the Teacher of Righteousness had been martyred and crucified by Alexander Jannaeus, and that his followers believed he would reappear at the End time as Messiah, based on Qumran document Commentary on Nahum 1.4–9 (a position that he re-iterated in 1986). His colleagues in Jerusalem immediately responded with a letter to the Times on 16 March 1956 refuting his claim. The letter concluded,\n\nOne result of this letter seemed to be that his appointment at Manchester was not to be renewed. However, in July after several uneasy months the appointment was renewed.\n\nAllegro was asked a number of times by the Jordanian Director of Antiquities if he would publish the text of the Copper Scroll. After a few years of waiting for Milik's publication of the scroll, Allegro succumbed and set about publishing the text. His book, \"The Treasure of the Copper Scroll\", was released in 1960, while the official publication had to wait another two years. Although several of his readings in the text are acknowledged, Allegro's book was disparaged by his colleagues. He believed that the treasure in the scroll was real—a view now held by most scholars—and led an expedition to attempt to find items mentioned in the scroll, though without success.\n\nDuring this period Allegro also published two popular books on the Dead Sea scrolls, \"The Dead Sea Scrolls\" (1956) and \"The People of the Dead Sea Scrolls\" (1958). He was keen to photograph the site of Qumran and various texts, providing an important source of information for posterity.\n\nAllegro was entrusted with the publication of 4Q158–4Q186, a collection of fragments which mainly contained exemplars of a unique kind of commentary on biblical works known as \"pesharim\". He believed that it was necessary to get these works out as quickly as possible and published several preliminary editions in learned journals during the late 1950s. He told de Vaux that he could have his share of the texts ready in 1960, but due to hold ups had to wait until 1968 for his volume, \"Discoveries in the Judaean Desert of Jordan V: 4Q158–4Q186\", to be published. He reworked his material in 1966 with the assistance of a Manchester colleague, Arnold Anderson, before publication. He stated in the volume that\n\nJohn Strugnell published a severe critique of the volume, \"Notes en Marge du volume V des 'Discoveries in the Judean Desert of Jordan'\" in \"Revue de Qumran\". Allegro's minimalist approach has received widespread scorn in the scholarly world, which nevertheless had the opportunity to analyse the Allegro texts for decades while waiting for other editors to publish their allotments. The first part of Strugnell's allotment was published in 1994.\n\nAs early as 1956 Allegro held controversial views regarding the content of the scrolls, stating in a letter to de Vaux, \"It's a pity that you and your friends cannot conceive of anything written about Christianity without trying to grind some ecclesiastical or non-ecclesiastical axe.\" The bulk of his work on the Dead Sea Scrolls was done by 1960 and he was at odds with his scrolls colleagues. When a conflict broke out with H.H. Rowley concerning Allegro's interpretation of the scrolls, Allegro, on the invitation of F.F. Bruce, moved from the Department of Near East Studies in the Faculty of Arts at Manchester to the Faculty of Theology. It was during his stay in Theology that he wrote his controversial book, \"The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross\", whose subtitle was \"A Study of the Nature and Origins of Christianity within the Fertility Cults of the Ancient Near East\". Apparently realising the impact this book would have, Allegro resigned his post at Manchester.\n\nAllegro's book \"The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross\" (1970) argued that Christianity began as a shamanistic cult. In his books \"The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross\" and \"The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth\" (1979), Allegro put forward the theory that stories of early Christianity originated in an Essene clandestine cult centred around the use of psychedelic mushrooms, and that the \"New Testament\" is the coded record of this shamanistic cult. Allegro further argued that the authors of the Christian gospels did not understand the Essene thought. When writing down the Gospels based on the stories they had heard, the evangelists confused the meaning of the scrolls. In this way, according to Allegro, the Christian tradition is based on a misunderstanding of the scrolls. He also argued that the story of Jesus was based on the crucifixion of the Teacher of Righteousness in the scrolls. Mark Hall writes that Allegro suggested the Dead Sea Scrolls all but proved that a historical Jesus never existed.\n\nAllegro argued that Jesus in the \"Gospels\" was in fact a code for a type of hallucinogen, the \"Amanita muscaria\", and that Christianity was the product of an ancient \"sex-and-mushroom\" cult. Critical reaction was swift and harsh: fourteen British scholars (including Allegro's mentor at Oxford, Godfrey Driver) denounced it. Sidnie White Crawford wrote of the publication of \"Sacred Mushroom\", \"Rightly or wrongly, Allegro would never be taken seriously as a scholar again.\"\n\nAllegro's theory of a shamanistic cult as the origin of Christianity was criticised sharply by Welsh historian Philip Jenkins who wrote that Allegro was an eccentric scholar who relied on texts that did not exist in quite the form he was citing them. Jenkins called the \"Sacred Mushroom and the Cross\" \"possibly the single most ludicrous book on Jesus scholarship by a qualified academic\". Based on the reactions to the book, Allegro's publisher later apologized for issuing the book and Allegro was forced to resign his academic post. A 2006 article discussing Allegro's work called for his theories to be re-evaluated by the mainstream. In November 2009 \"The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross\" was reprinted in a 40th anniversary edition with a 30-page addendum by Carl Ruck of Boston University.\n\nIn 1988 John Marco Allegro died of a heart attack on his 65th birthday in his home in Sandbach, Cheshire.\n\nAmong Allegro's works are the following:\n\nHis scholarly journal articles include:\n\nAn undated play 'The Lively Oracles' (with Roy Plomley).\n\n\n"}

Its neighbours are Kadıköy to the west and Kartal to the east. The mayor of Maltepe is Ali Kılıç (CHP). Maltepe used to border Ümraniye from the northwest between 1992 and 2004. However, the Yeni Çamlıca quarter changed to Ümraniye in 1994 and the Ferhatpaşa quarter passed to Samandıra where bounded to Kartal district in 2004. Ferhatpaşa's secession led to ending of neighbourhood between Maltepe and Ümraniye.\n\nIn Byzantine times, the area was known as Bryas (). In ca. 837, the emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842) erected here a palace in Arab style, inspired by the palaces of the Abbasids in Baghdad, described to him by his ambassador to the Abbasid court, John Grammatikos. A ruin in nearby Küçükyalı has been identified as it.\n\nThis coast has been a retreat from the city since Byzantine and Ottoman times, and right up until the 1970s was a rural area peppered with summer homes for wealthy Istanbul residents. Being on the suburban railway line Maltepe was a favourite spot for day-trippers or weekenders to visit the beach and many summer houses were built there. Many of these houses remain but Maltepe is no longer a beach retreat: the Marmara sea is no longer clean enough to swim in, although the sea-front is still pleasant to sit, drink tea and enjoy the views of the Princes Islands.\n\nThe population grew rapidly from the 70's onwards when, following the building of the Bosphorus Bridge, it became possible to commute from here to the city. Buses along the E5 highway to the bridge, and minibuses to the ferry docks at Kadıköy now carry lower-middle class commuters (the wealthier preferring to live in smarter areas nearer the city, in Kadıköy itself). These people live either in quiet tree-lined streets of four- to six-storey apartment building with gardens around them, or in modern housing complexes with tennis-courts, children's playgrounds and security guards on the gate.\n\nBeing generally cheaper than Kadıköy, Maltepe is popular with young-families and newlyweds. \nDuring the earthquake of 1999 Maltepe suffered badly and many tall apartment blocks needed structural repair, some still bear the cracks of structural damage, something which reduced the price of property in Maltepe considerably. Over the past two years however, prices have risen again despite warnings that Maltepe is always under threat from earthquakes in the future. \n\nThe E5 highway cuts through Maltepe and north of the highway is the poorer area of Başıbüyük, a tree-covered hill with a hospital on it (formerly Istanbul's tuberculosis isolation hospital) and also a large cemetery. But it does have a great view of the coastline and the islands. A large proportion of the residents are from the Black Sea coast and there are some excellent bakeries and Akçaabat kofte restaurants (traditional to that area of Turkey).\n\nMaltepe is also home to one of the largest Mosques in Istanbul. Recently built and the cause of much criticism (due to the cost) by the Islamist leaning municipality. Below the Mosque there is a bookshop and supermarket. This has changed since the renting of below grounds to several enterprises, including a polyclinics and a supermarket as well as underground carpark.\n\nThe Mosque has been built according to the traditional standard shape of a Turkish Mosque (rounded shape with 4 minarets) but internally it is particularly impressive with a tall high dome, a large gallery and balcony where women may pray (which many do 5 times a day, it is now becoming more and more common to find women attending the Mosque to pray particularly on Fridays but more and more for all of the five daily prayers especially amongst the young) The galleries have carved wood frames and there are several large tiled mosaics around the Mosque of various sights of importance to Islam and Muslims (for example the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. The Mosque has become something of a central point for Maltepe as it both can be seen from a considerable distance and is a central stop for buses and minibuses taking commuters from Kadikoy to the outskirts of the city.\n\nMaltepe was in the past also famous for its coastline and it does command an excellent view of the Princes' Islands. Nearer to the sea can be found almost a 'village' within the city where there are many small winding streets and quaint old houses generally referred to as 'old Maltepe.' Here there are also several bars and restaurants.\n\nMaltepe is just a little far from the city. There is a busy shopping district and some big supermarkets with Burger Kings, branches of some pastry shops and all the other modern amenities. Maltepe has cinemas, fast-food places, and kebab houses. And there is the sea shore, where there are cafes and some bars and cafes with live music similar (but on a much smaller scale) to those found in Kadıköy or in Taksim (on the European side of the city). The public transport is mainly for commuters and doesn't run into the night for party-goers though mini buses or 'dolmuses do run late into the night, often until at least 3am depending on destination. A large mosque has been constructed in the centre of Maltepe (built on 1992), the main distinctive landmark.\n\nPolitically the area has always been a stronghold of the center right ANAP party but following the chaotic and corrupt performance of both left and right in Turkey in the 90's people have switched their vote to the Islamic-leaning AKP swept to power here. But as a result of 2009 municipal election this situation has changed and CHP was elected.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1809884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809884", "title": "Too Cool", "text": "Too Cool\n\nToo Cool was a professional wrestling tag team and group active in the World Wrestling Federation (later World Wrestling Entertainment) between 1998 and 2001 and for a short time in 2004 and 2014. The group contained members Grandmaster Sexay, Scotty 2 Hotty, and Rikishi.\n\nThe duo of \"Too Sexy\" Brian Christopher and \"Too Hot\" Scott Taylor were originally a tag team known as Too Much. They made their appearance at WrestleMania XIV in a tag battle royal won by L.O.D. 2000. The team feuded with fellow light heavyweight wrestlers such as Taka Michinoku and aided Jerry \"The King\" Lawler (Christopher's father) in his feud with Al Snow. They also feuded with The Headbangers, The Oddities, 8-Ball and Skull and The Hardy Boyz.\n\nIn 1999, Christopher became Grandmaster Sexay, Taylor became Scotty Too Hotty (later spelled as Scotty 2 Hotty) and Too Much was rebranded as Too Cool, debuting on television during the June 13, 1999 episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\". They originally remained villainous characters, but in late 1999, around the time Rikishi Fatu joined the team, they turned into fan favorites. Too Cool's new characteristic was that of hip hop fans, which saw the trio of Scotty 2 Hotty, Grandmaster Sexay and Rikishi Phatu dancing around the ring while lights flashed and dance music played, an act that quickly became very popular with fans. In addition to the wildly popular post-match dancing routine, several of Too Cool's signature moves became extremely popular with the fans, including Scotty 2 Hotty's \"The Worm\" and Rikishi Phatu's Stinky Face.\n\nA famous moment came when the trio were all participants in the 2000 Royal Rumble. Rikishi had eliminated all three entrants in the match thus far, leaving only him and Grandmaster Sexay in the ring. Rikishi looked as if he was about to throw Grandmaster Sexay out of the ring to eliminate him from the Rumble, but Scotty 2 Hotty entered the match next and convinced Rikishi to instead dance to their music while the Rumble match was still ongoing. At the conclusion of their dance segment in the middle of the Rumble, Rikishi surprised his teammates by delivering a double clothesline and throwing them both to the outside to eliminate them. Rikishi shrugged his shoulders and his partners accepted the elimination with a good humor; no dissension would arise between them. Soon after this, Christopher suffered an injury and while he was recuperating, Scotty won the Light Heavyweight Championship.\n\nToo Cool received arguably their biggest push when they became embroiled in a feud against the McMahon-Helmsley Regime, mainly wrestling against D-Generation X members Triple H, \"The Road Dogg\" Jesse James and X-Pac, along with a feud against the Radicalz. Too Cool participated in several main events on television during this push, including a 10-man tag team match on WWE Raw where Too Cool teamed with The Rock and Mick Foley (as Cactus Jack) against Triple H, X-Pac and The Radicalz. \n\nToo Cool's success would peak in the middle of 2000 when Scotty 2 Hotty and Grandmaster Sexay defeated Edge and Christian for the Tag Team Championship on an episode of \"Raw is War\" on May 29, 2000, while Rikishi would defeat Chris Benoit for the Intercontinental Championship on the June 20 edition of \"SmackDown!\"\n\nDespite enjoying immense popularity among the fans, Too Cool began to fragment in late 2000 when Rikishi left the group after becoming a villain. In March 2001, Too Cool fully disbanded when Scotty was, in storyline, sidelined with a broken ankle caused by Kurt Angle. In reality, he needed time off for neck surgery. That same year, Sexay was released from the WWF after he was detained while attempting to cross the Canada–United States border with illegal drugs in his possession. After returning, Scotty formed a new tag team with Albert called The Zoo Crew that lasted until March 2002. Scotty would injure his neck in April 2002 and was inactive for over a year.\n\nRikishi would eventually become a face again and reunited with Scotty who returned after an 18 month absence from a neck injury. to compete on the SmackDown! brand in October 2003. They later went on to win the WWE Tag Team Championship on February 5, 2004 after defeating the Basham Brothers. Also around this time the WWE briefly re-hired Grand Master Sexay however he was on the Raw brand and had no interaction with Hotty or Rikishi. They held the title for a little over two months before losing the title to Charlie Haas and Rico on April 22. Rikishi would be released from the company shortly after the title loss, while Scotty remained with the company until being released on May 15, 2007.\n\nOn the January 6, 2014 episode of \"Old School Raw\", Too Cool reunited with Rikishi, defeating 3MB (Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre and Jinder Mahal) in a six-man tag match. This was the first time in over 13 years that the trio were in a 6-man tag team match. Too Cool also appeared at NXT Arrival, challenging The Ascension for the NXT Tag Team Championship. The Ascension would prevail however, retaining the titles.\n\nSexay and Hotty would reunite after 2 and half years for one night on September 28, 2003 for Memphis Wrestling. They defeated Doug Gilbert and Shock.\n\nAfter Scotty 2 Hotty was released from WWE, he briefly reunited with Grandmaster Sexay to compete for the UWF Live's Rock 'n' Express Tag Team Tournament. In the second round of the tournament on July 19, 2007, Too Cool defeated the Extreme Horsemen (C.W. Anderson and Steve Corino). The next day, Too Cool lost to the Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) in the semi-final match of the Winner's Bracket. Too Cool made their final appearance for the UWF on July 21 as they lost to The Naturals in the third round match to of the Loser's Bracket.\n\nIn 2009, Sexay and Rikishi reunited to compete for the Hulk Hogan's Tour in Australia. Due to copyright issues with World Wrestling Entertainment, Sexay and Rikishi competed as Brian Christopher and Solofa Fatu, Jr., respectively, and were unable to use the Too Cool name. On November 21, the first night of the tour, they defeated Orlando Jordan and Umaga. Three days later, they defeated Rock of Love (Billy Blade and Kadin Anthony). On November 26, Christopher and Fatu teamed with The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobbs and Jerry Sags) to defeat Black Pearl, Vampire Warrior and Rock of Love. On November 28, the final night of the tour, Fatu and Christopher defeated Pearl and Warrior. Later, the three would go on to reunite in Gangrel's Territory League promotion as part of the Las Vegas Highrollers team.\n\nIn March 2014, Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty reunited at Memphis Power Wrestling's Revenge at Resorts II Cool Event to compete against Chase Stevens and Crimson. Too Cool won the match, but were attacked post-match by Cerebus, Doug Gilbert, and Bill Dundee. On September 5, 2014, Too Cool faced the Maryland Championship Wrestling (MCW) Tag Team Champions The Black Wall Street (Naplam Bomb and Solo) in a losing effort.\nOn February 22, 2015, Scotty and Sexay made an appearance at Lincoln Fight Factory Wrestling Turn It Up, defeating S C Supreme and Stixx. They continued to make appearances at conventions and some independent wrestling shows until Brian Christopher Lawler's death in July 2018. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1809885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809885", "title": "Sega Channel", "text": "Sega Channel\n\nSega Channel was an online game service developed by Sega for the Genesis video game console, serving as a content delivery system. Launched in December 1994, Sega Channel was provided to the public by TCI and Time Warner Cable through cable television services by way of coaxial cable. It was a pay to play service, through which customers could access Genesis games online, play game demos, and get cheat codes. Lasting until July 31, 1998, Sega Channel operated three years after the release of Sega's next generation console, the Sega Saturn. Though criticized for its poorly timed launch and high subscription fee, Sega Channel has been praised for its innovations in downloadable content and impact on online game services.\n\nReleased in Japan as the Mega Drive in 1988, North America in 1989, and Europe and other regions as the Mega Drive in 1990, the Sega Genesis was Sega's entry into the 16-bit era of video game consoles. In 1990, Sega started its first internet-based service for Genesis, Sega Meganet, in Japan. Operating through a cartridge and a peripheral called the Mega Modem, it allowed Mega Drive owners to play 17 games online. A North American version, the \"Tele-Genesis, was announced but never released. Another phone-based system, the Mega Anser, turned the Japanese Mega Drive into an online banking terminal. Due to Meganet's low number of games, high price, and the Mega Drive's lack of success in Japan, the system was a commercial failure. By 1992, the Mega Modem peripheral could be found in bargain bins at a reduced price, and a remodeled version of the Mega Drive released in 1993 removed the EXT 9-pin port, preventing connections to the Meganet service.\nIn April 1993, Sega announced the Sega Channel service, which would use cable television services to deliver content. In the US, national testing in June, and deployment in December, with a complete US release in 1994. By June 1994, 21 cable companies had signed up to carry the Sega Channel service. US fees varied depending on location, but were approximately US$15 monthly, plus a $25 activation fee, which included the adapter. The Sega Channel expanded into Canada in late 1995, with an approximately Can$19 monthly fee. During the planning stages of the service, Sega looked to capitalize on the rental market, which had seen some success with the Sega CD being rented through Blockbuster, Inc., and was looking to base the service's games and demos to sell more cartridges.\n\nIn early 1995, Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama ended development on the Sega Genesis and its add-ons, the Sega CD and Sega 32X. This decision was made to support the Sega Saturn, which had been released in Japan already. This placed the release of the Sega Channel during the Genesis' decline from the market. At its peak, Sega Channel had over 250,000 subscribers, but by 1997, the number had dropped to 230,000, two years after Nakayama shifted focus from the Genesis to the Saturn. Though Sega looked at options to bring the service to PCs, it had been discontinued by July 31, 1998.\n\nAfter making the initial purchase and paying the activation fee, Genesis owners would receive an adapter that would be inserted into the cartridge slot of the console. The adapter connected the console to a cable television wire, doing so by the use of a coaxial cable output in the rear of the cartridge. Starting up a Genesis console with an active Sega Channel adapter installed would prompt for the service's main menu to be loaded, which was a process that took approximately 30 seconds. From there, gamers could access the content they wished to play and download it into their system, which could take up to a few minutes per game. This data would be downloaded into the adaptor's on-board 4 MB RAM, and would be erased when the system was powered off.\n\nProgramming and transmission of the Sega Channel's monthly services started with a production team at Sega, which would put together content every month and load it onto a CD-ROM. It was then sent to TCI's satellite station, located in Denver, Colorado. From the station, the signal was transmitted via a Galaxy 7 satellite, which uploaded at 1.435 GHz and downloaded at 1.1 GHz, to the local cable providers. In Canada and across South America and Europe, however, the satellite transmission stage was bypassed altogether in favor of direct uploads of the Sega Channel CD-ROM via a cable television headend. In order for the signal to function properly, it had to be clear of noise in order to prevent download interruptions. To ensure no issues, cable providers had to \"clean\" their broadcast signal.\n\nThe Sega Channel service (also known as \"Sega On The Line\") hosted up to 50 Genesis games at any one time. Titles would rotate monthly; however, some updates happened on a weekly basis. In 1997, Sega changed the number of games hosted at a time to 70 and the update frequency to biweekly. Games for the service included titles developed by Sega, such as \"Sonic & Knuckles\", \"Eternal Champions\", and \"Space Harrier II\"; as well as titles developed by licensees of Sega, such as \"Bubsy 2\" and \"Aladdin\". Some of these games had reduced content compared to their cartridge release so that they could fit the adapter's memory, such as \"Super Street Fighter II\". Sega Channel also hosted games in some regions that would not receive a cartridge release, such as \"Pulseman\", \"\", and \"Alien Soldier\", which were hosted on the service in North America. The service also offered demos of upcoming games, such as \"Primal Rage\". Though games and demos rotated on a regular basis, categories into which games were placed remained static and did not change. With parental controls in mind, all games for the service received a rating from the Videogame Rating Council. The service also contained a lockout system which would allow parents to set a passcode in order to access mature rated content.\n\nIn addition to games and demos, Sega Channel also hosted other features. Cheat codes were directly accessible from the network, as well as game hints. The service also hosted contests, such as a promotion with Electronic Arts' \"Triple Play '96\", and a 1995 event where players who completed \"Primal Rage\" during a brief 24-hour period where the full game was accessible were given a phone number to call, making them eligible to win prizes.\n\nDuring its lifetime, Sega Channel won one of \"Popular Science\"'s \"Best of What's New\" award for the year 1994. Likewise, in August 1995, a survey conducted by \"Sports Illustrated\" found that children between 9 and 13 years old were five times more likely to subscribe to Sega Channel than to purchase a Sega Saturn or the upcoming Nintendo 64 or PlayStation. The service would go on to garner as many as 250,000 subscribers; however, Sega had anticipated having over one million subscribers by the end of its first year, and had made the service available to over 20 million households.\n\nRetrospective reception of Sega Channel praises its innovation and role in the development of online gaming, but criticizes its high subscription fees and timing into the market. IGN writer Adam Redsell notes how Sega Channel caused many cable companies to clean their broadcast signal and its role in the development of high-speed internet, stating \"...the very fact that you’re enjoying broadband internet right now could well be thanks to SEGA.\" Levi Buchanan, also writing for IGN, credits Sega Channel with its role in the development of modern gaming and content delivery services, such as Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, stating \"SEGA and the entire industry learned important lessons from the SEGA Channel. SEGA was still committed to the idea of downloads and online, as evidenced by the Dreamcast's SegaNet... You can also see the DNA of early services like the SEGA Channel in modern portals like XBLA and PSN, where demos are now a staple.\" The staff of UGO Networks also credits Sega Channel with being an important step in the development of both services.\n\nKen Horowitz of Sega-16 criticizes Sega's poor timing of the launch of Sega Channel and the subscription's high price. According to Horowitz, \"Who would spend $13 a month to play games for a dying system? This horrendous blunder (one of many by Sega Enterprises) caused retailers to dump their inventory of systems, thereby sealing the fate of the Sega Channel once and for all.\" Buchanan echoes the same sentiments, stating, \"Perhaps if the SEGA Channel had been released earlier in the console's lifecycle—the Genesis launched in 1989 in America—things might have turned out differently. After all, the service did gain notice for its advancement of gaming and technology.\" UGO also notes the potential Sega Channel could have had with some more development time in the field of competitive multiplayer, stating, \"If the Sega Channel had come a little earlier in the life of the Genesis it would have seen much more exposure, and maybe online play would have been feasible for games that could have been developed directly for the service.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1809886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809886", "title": "Kappa Alpha Order", "text": "Kappa Alpha Order\n\nKappa Alpha Order (KA), commonly known as Kappa Alpha or simply KA, is a social fraternity and a fraternal order founded in 1865 at Washington College in Lexington, Virginia. As of December 2015, the Kappa Alpha Order lists 133 active chapters, five provisional chapters, and 52 suspended chapters. Along with Alpha Tau Omega and Sigma Nu, the order represents a third of the Lexington Triad. Since its establishment in 1865, The Order has initiated more than 150,000 members.\n\nKappa Alpha Order was founded as Phi Kappa Chi on December 21, 1865, at Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, in Lexington, Virginia. James Ward Wood, William Archibald Walsh, and brothers William Nelson Scott and Stanhope McClelland Scott are the founders of the fraternity. Soon after the founding, the local Virginia Beta chapter of Phi Kappa Psi protested the name \"Phi Kappa Chi\", due to the similarity of the names, leading Wood to change the name of the fraternity to K.A. by April 1866. Within one year, the order's ritual would be expanded upon by Samuel Zenas Ammen, who was dubbed the \"practical founder\". In the years that followed, the fraternity spread throughout the Southern United States, as well as other states such as California, Arizona and New Mexico.\n\nKA is one-third of the Lexington Triad, along with Alpha Tau Omega and Sigma Nu. The founders listed Robert E. Lee's chivalry and gentlemanly conduct as an inspiration. At the 1923 Convention, Lee was designated as the \"Spiritual Founder\" of the Order by John Temple Graves.\n\nKu Klux Klan founder John Lester claimed that the Klan's initiation ritual was based on a popular collegiate fraternal order. Allen Trelease makes the connection that \"Kuklos Adelphon (KA) almost certainly provided the model\" for the early Klan. It is likely that this organization inspired the creation of the Kappa Alpha Order, a prominent fraternity in the United States. Kuklos Adelphon dissolved at the end of the Civil War. Immediately following the dissolution of Kuklos Adelphon, Kappa Alpha Order was founded at the end of the American Civil War and became the spiritual successor to Kuklos Adelphon with the same initials to signify their relationship to each other.\n\nAccording to the fraternity, \"The popular old antebellum society, Kuklos Adelphon, founded at the University of North Carolina in 1812, had all but perished during the recent war, but its reputation was well known in the South. Kuklos Adelphon was more than a mere college fraternity. Its “Circles” met in communities long after its members left college campuses. Wood was aware of this and the concept of a lifelong “Circle of Brothers” had great appeal to him.\"\n\nThe founding members of Kappa Alpha Order enrolled at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in the Spring semester of 1866. Robert E. Lee was the president of the college from the Summer of 1865 until his death in 1870. James Ward Wood, one of the founders of the Order, fought with Lee and the Confederacy in Company F of the 7th Virginia Cavalry. However, Kappa Alpha Order has since made it its mission to move beyond the looming shadow of the Civil War. The organization hails Lee as \"a true gentleman, the last gentle knight.\" Rather than illuminating Lee's involvement in the war as the Commander of the Confederate States Army (CSA), the fraternity sheds light on his postbellum reconciliation efforts. Among Lee's memorable quotations, the organization highlights words such as, \"Let the past be but the past. Let us move forward and bear no malice.\" Similarly, the Varlet of Kappa Alpha Order reads, \"Lee was determined to set an example for fellow southerners, and he hoped the emotions of the war wars would soon be forgotten...\" The modern history of KA portrays Lee as a hero and aims the trajectory of the fraternity away from and completely divorced from the tragedies of the war.\n\nWhile Lee holds a position of stature within the fraternity, this was not always the case as evidenced by Lee becoming the spiritual founder (i.e. moral role model) in 1923 and part of the KA Mission Statement in 1994. For over half a century (1866-1923), the fraternity maintained no formal ties to Lee. During those years before Lee was officially affiliated with KA, however, fraternity manuscripts mentioned Southern culture and Lee's influence on the fraternity in a number of ways. For example, the \"History and Catalogue of the Kappa Alpha Fraternity\" (published by Chi Chapter at Vanderbilt University in 1891 with permission by the Fifteenth Kappa Alpha Convention) describes the organization's founding:“Conceived and matured at a college of which Gen. R. E. Lee was president, at the close of a fateful military conflict; in the Valley of Virginia made dear to Southern hearts by its vigor in battling for Southern rights...plundered and wrecked by the infamous Hunter’s invading force; among the people with whom Stonewall Jackson lived till duty called him to arms... with this environment it was but natural that the Order should be of a semi-military type and have for its aim the cultivation and graces conceived to be distinctively Southern.”KA endorsed a version of the Lost Cause narrative in its early historical documents. The fraternity's history from 1891 paints the battle in Virginia as one of valor in defense of states' rights rather than in defense of slavery. It also depicts Union forces as invaders. Rather than obeying Lee's admonition to forget the conflict, the early patriarchs of the fraternity were keen to forget the darker parts of the war, while idolizing the Southern heroes whom they believed set the archetype for the true gentleman. Accordingly, the fraternity history reads, \"Southern in its loves, it took Jackson and Lee as its favorite types of the perfect Knight. Caucasian in its sympathies, it excluded the African from membership.” Built into the early foundations of the organization is racially exclusionary language.\n\nIt is with this context that the organization named Robert E. Lee the spiritual founder in 1923. There are four justifications the fraternity provides for Lee's placement on a pedestal within the organization:\n\n\nLee has continued to inspire the members of Kappa Alpha Order since 1923 and remains the spiritual founder today. In 1994, the Advisory Council of KA set the Mission Statement of the organization as such:Kappa Alpha Order seeks to create a lifetime experience which centers on reverence to God, duty, honor, character and gentlemanly conduct as inspired by Robert E. Lee, our spiritual founder.This, too, remains unchanged.\n\nThe Kappa Alpha Order National Administrative Office is located at Mulberry Hill, in Lexington, Virginia. It is documented that Mulberry Hill is where Robert E. Lee spent his first night in Lexington, after arriving to take over as president of Washington College. Mulberry Hill is a Virginia Historic Landmark, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The offices for the Kappa Alpha Order Educational Foundation are also housed there.\n\nThe Number I's Leadership Institute (Number 1 is the title of the chapter president) is an intensive informational and educational retreat for chapter presidents. The retreat is held at a Baptist conference center.\n\nEstablished in 1982, the Kappa Alpha Order Educational Foundation (KAOEF) is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. The Foundation provides grants for educational programs of the fraternity, such as the National Leadership Institute and Province Councils, and provides scholarships to graduate and undergraduate students. KAOEF funds these programs with donations contributed by KA alumni.\n\n\"The Kappa Alpha Journal\" (or \"KA Journal\") is the fraternity's magazine. It has been published since 1879. Members of the Kappa Alpha Order are entitled to a free subscription to \"The KA Journal\" if initiated within the last ten years, or are a member of The Loyal Order. Members initiated between 1936 and 1951 are given a lifetime subscription to the publication.\n\nThe Loyal Order is an alumni program for the Kappa Alpha Order. The national office uses the money from Loyal Order memberships to help defray the cost of distributing the \"KA Journal\", as well as other alumni resources.\n\nThe Military Division of Kappa Alpha Order was established in 2009. Membership is open to Kappa Alphas who are currently serving, honorably discharged, or retired from the United States Armed Forces. The Recognition Pin of the Military Order features the Maltese Cross, utilizing KA's colors crimson and old gold, and has 8 points in the cross, which symbolize the chivalric virtues of loyalty, piety, frankness, bravery, glory and honor, contempt of death, helpfulness towards the poor and sick, and respect for the church.\n\nThe colors of The Order are traditionally Crimson and Old Gold. The colors represent the blood sacrificed (crimson red) and the money spent (old gold) in defense of the country. The flowers of the Order are the crimson rose and the magnolia blossom. The crimson rose represents masculine might and the white magnolia blossom represents purity.\n\nThe flowers of the order and a ribbon featuring the order's motto adorn the bottom of the crest. The crest itself is representative of several things; the hand holding the axe represents the continuing power of the Knight Commander and of the order. The Helmet was, at one time, a symbol used by the Knight Commander of the Order. The badge is featured at the center of the crest, and the lions on either side represent different things each. The lion on the left, looking away, symbolizes \"rampant\", meaning magnanimous. The lion on the right, looking towards you, symbolizes \"regardent\", which means cautious or circumspect.\n\nThe Kappa Alpha Order motto is \"Dieu et les Dames\" (God and the Ladies) and is written on the ceiling of the Mississippi State Capitol.\nKappa Alpha Order also utilizes the motto tagline \"A Moral Compass for the Modern Gentlemen.\"\n\nKappa Alpha Order's membership manual is called The Varlet. It includes KAO's laws, history, structure, etc. Each member receives one in cardinal red and it is available to read online for non-members.\n\nKu Klux Klan founder John Lester claimed that the Klan's initiation ritual was based on a popular collegiate fraternal order. It has been speculated by Allen Trelease that \"Kuklos Adelphon almost certainly provided the model\" for the early Klan. Kuklos Adelphon dissolved during the American Civil War.\n\nAccording to the fraternity, \"The popular old antebellum society, Kuklos Adelphon, founded at the University of North Carolina in 1812, had all but perished during the recent war, but its reputation was well known in the South. Kuklos Adelphon was more than a mere college fraternity. Its “Circles” met in communities long after its members left college campuses. Wood was aware of this and the concept of a lifelong “Circle of Brothers” had great appeal to him.\"\nThe fraternity has been criticized for identification with the Confederacy and other forms of racism. In November 2002, the Zeta Psi and Kappa Alpha Order chapters at the University of Virginia were suspended and subsequently cleared after the fraternities held a Halloween party where a few guests were photographed wearing blackface and dressed up as Uncle Sam and Venus and Serena Williams.\n\nIn 2009, Kappa Alpha Order at the University of Alabama was criticized for wearing Confederate uniforms for an \"Old South\" parade that passed by an African-American sorority house celebrating its 35th anniversary. The organization apologized for any offense that might have been caused. Kappa Alpha Order on other campuses, including Auburn, Centenary College, Mississippi State University, and the University of Georgia had already ceased to wear Confederate uniforms in public following complaints from students. The national organization banned the wearing of Confederate uniforms to its \"Old South\" parades in 2010, although video from 2012 showed the uniforms still being worn.\n\nIn April 2016, the fraternity's Tulane University chapter in New Orleans, Louisiana, constructed a sand-bag wall around its house that contained spray-painted slogans in reference to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The chapter said that the wall had been built for an annual \"capture the flag\" game and that the pro-Trump slogans were satirical and not in support of the candidate or his message. Some students protested that the wall was offensive and anti-immigrant or anti-Latino. The wall was later forcefully dismantled, allegedly in part by members of the Tulane football team.\n\nIn 2019, the fraternity suspended three members of its University of Mississippi chapter after they posted a photo on an Instagram account showing them posing with guns next to a bullet-riddled sign memorializing Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American lynched in Mississippi in 1955. The local U.S. Attorney said that the matter had been referred for further investigation to the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. The students withdrew from the university, but they are not charged with a hate crime.\n\nIn 1980, several students at Vanderbilt University including Graham Matthews, an African-American graduate student in the divinity school, decided to hold Nat Turner Day to protest the fraternity's celebration of Old South Day, when KA brothers dressed as CSA personnel. The university administrators sided with KA, banned Nat Turner Day, and let KA parade in their Confederate costumes. Michael Patton, now a philosophy professor at the University of Montevallo, \"put on a cap with antlers\"; he was called a homophobic slur and beaten up by the KA chapter.\n\nIn 1997, a former pledge at Texas A&M University had to have a testicle surgically removed due to a fraternity member giving him a \"super wedgie.\" This same year a pet goat was shot and killed with a gun in front of pledges at the fraternity's chapter house. One fraternity member was indicted for the incident.\n\nIn 2008, the fraternity chapter at Midwestern State University was suspended for three years after a pledge almost died due to alcohol poisoning under the fraternity's supervision.\n\nIn 2011, the chapter at Georgetown College was suspended by the national office of the fraternity after several members allegedly shouted racial slurs at a minority student on campus during an event in which members run through campus in their boxer shorts and shout in front of women's dormitories, though no one willing to testify to this incident proved willing to step forward in the subsequent days. The national office also issued a public apology on behalf of the chapter. An African-American student who unsuccessfully demanded that the chapter take down a Confederate flag in the aftermath of the incident was suspended, however, for brandishing a toy gun.\n\nIn 2011, an investigation was started after a fraternity member fired a shotgun inside the University of Texas at Austin's chapter house. Following claims by the fraternity that the chapter had hazed pledges, hired adult performers for multiple live sex shows, and broken other fraternity rules, the fraternity suspended the chapter for one year. The chapter refuted the hazing allegation as minor and unsupported by evidence, and broke-ties with the national organization, forming a new fraternity, Texas Omicron. Kappa Alpha Order then sued Texas Omicron, unsuccessfully, for dues and other monies, as well as furnishings from the chapter house.\n\nIn 2013, the fraternity at the University of Virginia was temporarily suspended due to several serious allegations of hazing and misconduct.\n\nIn 2015, Jonathan Ford, the son of Alabama State Representative Craig Ford and a former football recruit at Birmingham-Southern College, sued the fraternity for hazing and injuries he says he sustained while pledging which resulted in his football career ending prematurely.\n\nIn 2015 the fraternity chapter at Virginia Wesleyan College was suspended for at least four years by the national organization. An investigation by the school determined that hazing had occurred in violation of school policy, but that it was not criminal.\n\nIn 2015, the chapter at Emory University was suspended for three years due to violating anti-hazing policies.\n\nIn 2016, the chapter at the University of Richmond was suspended after a strongly sexist and offensive email sent by the fraternity was reported to the university.\n\nIn 2016, the chapter at the University of Missouri was placed on suspension and investigation after a freshman pledging was hospitalized due to a hazing incident that involved drinking excessive amounts of alcohol with the purported purpose of somehow validating his manhood.\n\nIn 2016, the fraternity chapter at the College of Charleston was closed after the chapter president and other members were arrested for being involved in a major off-campus drug ring. The fraternity was also accused of drugging and raping several young women who attended their parties.\n\nIn 2017, the fraternity chapter at Southern Methodist University was suspended for four years (until 2021) and members living in the chapter house were forced to evacuate the premises for hazing pledges in the spring. The hazing found, according to the university: \"paddling; servitude required of new members; forcing new members to consume alcohol; forcing new members to participate in calisthenics; forcing new members to consume food items such as jalapeños, habaneros, red onions, and milk until vomiting was induced; forcing new members to wear clothing soiled with vomit; sleep deprivation; 'underground membership.'\"\n\n\n"}

It has a population of 298,143 as of 2011, more than triple the 1990 figure of 82,298. The mayor is Hüseyin Keskin of the Justice and Development Party. Sultanbeyli is a landlocked district, bordered by Sancaktepe to the west, Pendik to the east and Kartal to the south-west. \n\nHistorically the Sultanbeyli area was farmland on the far outskirts of Istanbul, until 1945 when the large land holdings of the Ottoman period were broken up, and 7,500 acres of land around the old Ankara-Istanbul road was parcelized for the settlement of Turkish migrants from Bulgaria. In 1957, Sultanbeyli was formally organised as a village, and after its establishment some shareholders began to sell their plots of land. The handover of the title deed for these sales could not be carried out because the forestry administration put restrictions on Sultanbeyli, but the sales continued.\n\nSultanbeyli became a large settlement centre in the late 1980s following the connection of the O-4 Motorway to the newly-constructed Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge in 1988. The new transport links made the village an attractive location for settlement, and between 1985 and 1990, Sultanbeyli's population skyrocketed from 3741 to 82 298. On December 31, 1987, the decision was made to establish Sultanbeyli as a municipality in the Kartal district of Istanbul, however, the administrative problems caused by the excessive population increase led to the first municipal elections only being held on 26 March 1989, and to the municipality being separated from Kartal into its own district in 1992. This caused Sultanbeyli to develop a reputation as a slum, but has since transitioned into a working class suburb.\n"}

Therefore, when preparing the conquest of Istanbul the Ottoman forces were keen to populate the Küçükçekmece area with the Turks, the Turkish presence in the area dates from this period.\n\nThe road from Istanbul to Europe has become increasingly important ever since and by the time of the population exchange with Greece at the founding of the Turkish Republic there were 50 Greek families in the village, the property they vacated was then used as a military depot. Little is left of this history; the church had long been converted to a mosque and was pulled down in 1977 for a new mosque to be built; fountains and ruins have disappeared. There is some remaining Ottoman architecture including a hunting lodge belonging to the sultans, (the name Avcılar means 'hunters' in Turkish) because actual hunters used to live in this area to protect the villages and some traditional farmhouses.\n\nUntil the second half of the 20th century, Avcılar remained a small village on the coast with lots of open lands. It has grown enormously since the 1980s. .\n\nThere has also been a great deal of industrial development, around the port and also on the road out towards the village of Firuzköy, which overlooks the inlet.\n\nAt one time the seashore at Avcılar was a retreat from the city, but now the port at Ambarlı is very busy. The road to Europe carries more traffic than ever, it is now a busy highway, littered with billboards and heaving with trucks. Traveling into the city from Avcılar requires winding up onto this highway from Avcılar's network of bridges and narrow underpasses.\n\nApartments in the center of Avcılar near the sea are expensive . The center of Avcılar has places to sit outside, many restaurants, two cinemas, an active night-life and a busy shopping area with pedestrianized shopping streets with American-style fast-food joints, narrow side-streets of little shops and cafes. Young people wander among people selling goods on the sidewalk.\n\nAfter the 1999 İzmit earthquake, the demographics of Avcılar changed dramatically. Before the earthquake, the majority of the population was Turkish immigrants from the Balkans, civil servants, university students and the sorts which constituted a relatively low crime rate. However, after the earthquake, most of these people left the district for most of the buildings were of low build quality and very vulnerable to earthquakes. The low estate prices attracted many people from mid and east Anatolia and this new demographic introduced a higher crime rate in Avcılar.\n\nThe magazine \"Bayan Yani\" is created here and it has had resistance from the authorities. Their offices have been visited by people carrying petrol cans. 150 media workers have been held under arrest in Turkey including the cartoonist Musa Kart who is held in a location near to Avcilar.\n\nOne of Istanbul University's campuses is sited in Avcılar, housing the faculties of engineering, business management, sports and veterinary medicine. The campus is far away from the Anatolian Side of Istanbul and transportation was very complicated and difficult before the introduction of the Metrobus system. There is parkland in the campus and around Lake Küçükçekmece.\n\nThis district was badly hit during 1999 earthquake. A major fault-line follows the Marmara shore and Avcılar is built on low-lying sandy soil, some of its landfill, right on this shore. This and the fact that the buildings are tall and were very cheaply built make it a particularly vulnerable area.\nBuildings damaged in 1999 have been repaired but an earthquake centered nearer to Istanbul will damage this area severely and destroy it.\n\n"}

{"id": "1809910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809910", "title": "Smart gun", "text": "Smart gun\n\nA smart gun, also called a smart-gun, smartgun, or personalized gun, is a firearm that can detect its authorized user(s) or something that is normally only possessed by its authorized user(s). The term is also used in science fiction to refer to various types of semi-autonomous firearms.\n\nSmart guns have one or more systems that allow them to fire only when activated by an authorized user. Those systems typically employ RFID chips or other proximity tokens, fingerprint recognition, magnetic rings, or mechanical locks. They can thereby prevent accidental shootings, gun thefts, and criminal usage by persons not authorized to use the guns.\n\nRelated to smart guns are other smart firearms safety devices such as biometric or RFID activated accessories and safes.\n\nNo smart gun has ever been sold on the commercial market in the United States. The Armatix iP1, a .22 caliber handgun with an active RFID watch used to unlock it, is the most mature smart gun developed. It was briefly planned to be offered at a few retailers before being quickly withdrawn due to pressure from gun-rights advocates concerned that it would trigger the New Jersey Childproof Handgun Law. \n\nAs of 2019, a number of startups and companies including Armatix, Biofire, LodeStar Firearms, and Swiss company SAAR are purportedly developing various smart handguns and rifles, but none have brought the technology to market. \n\nReception to the concept of smart gun technology has been mixed. There have been public calls to develop the technology, most notably from President Obama. Gun-rights groups including the NRA have expressed concerns that the technology could be mandated, and some firearms enthusiasts are concerned that the technology wouldn't be reliable enough to trust.\n\nThe NRA and its membership boycotted Smith & Wesson after it was revealed in 1999 that the company was developing a smart gun for the U.S. government. \n\nMore recently, the official policy of the NRA-ILA, the lobbying arm of the NRA, with regards to smart guns, is as follows: \"The NRA doesn't oppose the development of \"smart\" guns, nor the ability of Americans to voluntarily acquire them. However, NRA opposes any law prohibiting Americans from acquiring or possessing firearms that don't possess \"smart\" gun technology.\"\n\nSome smart gun proponents have called for federal, state, and local police organizations to take the lead on adopting smart gun technology, either voluntarily or via purchasing mandate. There has been scattered support for voluntary test programs from some law enforcement leaders, including San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr, who has said, \"Officer safety is huge, so you wouldn't want to compel that upon officers. But we have so many officers who are so into technology, I am all but certain there are officers that would be willing to do such a pilot.\".\n\nRichard Beary, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said there would be \"plenty of agencies interested in beta testing the technology\" and that \"[a smart gun] can't be 99 percent accurate, it has to be 100 percent accurate. It has to work every single time.\" James Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents 325,000 officers nationwide, has stated, \"Police officers in general, federal officers in particular, shouldn't be asked to be the guinea pigs in evaluating a firearm that nobody's even seen yet. We have some very, very serious questions.\"\n\nIn the United States, New Jersey passed the Childproof Handgun Bill into state law on December 23, 2002, which would have required that all guns sold in the state of New Jersey have a mechanism to prevent unauthorized users from firing it, taking effect three years after such a smart gun is approved by the state. Weapons used by law enforcement officers would be exempt from the smart gun requirement. In July 2019, Governor Phil Murphy signed into law a bill which repealed substantially all of the original Childproof Handgun Law and replaced it with a requirement that after the state Attorney General approves a production model each firearms retailer in the state would be required to carry and display at least one smart gun on their shelves with \"a sign... disclosing the features of personalized handguns that are not offered by traditional handguns\".\n\nThe potential effects of New Jersey's smart gun law has also influenced opposition to the technology in the United States; two attempts to sell the Armatix iP1 smart gun in California and Maryland were met with opposition from gun rights groups, who argued that allowing the gun to be sold in the United States would trigger the law. In December 2014, the Attorney General of New Jersey determined that the Armatix iP1 would not meet the legal criteria sufficient to trigger the mandate.\n\nMany firearm enthusiasts object to smart guns on a philosophical and regulatory basis. Gun ownership advocate Kenneth W. Royce, writing under the pen name of \"Boston T. Party\", wrote that \"no defensive firearm should ever rely upon any technology more advanced than Newtonian physics. That includes batteries, radio links, encryption, scanning devices and microcomputers.\"\n\nTechCrunch technology and outdoors journalist Jon Stokes summarizes the reliability concerns with smart guns stating, \n\nSmart firearms safety technology is intended to prevent the accidental use and misuse of firearms by children and teens, as well as reducing accidental discharges or the use of a firearm against its owner if the firearm is stolen or taken away. Smart guns may also reduce incidents of suicide by unauthorized users of a firearm.\n\nLaw enforcement applications also hold promise; San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr went on record supporting smart guns for their potential to reduce the risk of having a law enforcement officer's gun used against him or her, and for rendering stolen guns unfirable. Richard Beary, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, was quoted in the Washington Post as saying there would be \"plenty of agencies interested in beta testing the [smart gun] technology.\"\n\nIn April 2014, Attorney General Eric Holder told a House appropriations subcommittee that his agency is exploring smart gun technology as a means for curbing gun violence. The Justice Department requested $382.1 million in increased spending for its fiscal year 2014 budget for \"gun safety,\" a figure which includes $2 million for \"Gun Safety Technology\" grants, which would award prizes for technologies that are \"proven to be reliable and effective.\"\n\nIn October 2013 the European Commission published a document by commissioner Cecilia Malmström, stating that \"the Commission will work with the firearms industry to explore technological solutions, such as biometric sensors where personal data is stored in the firearm, for ensuring that purchased firearms may only be used by their legal owner. It will carry out a detailed cost-benefit analysis on the question of making such 'smart gun' security features mandatory for firearms lawfully sold in the EU.\"\n\nJoseph Steinberg writes that \"biometrics take time to process and are often inaccurate – especially when a user is under duress – as is likely going to be the case in any situation in which he needs to brandish a gun... it is not ideal to add a requirement for power to devices utilized in cases of emergency that did not need electricity previously. How many fire codes allow fire extinguishers that require a battery to operate?\" Steinberg further writes that \"smartguns might be hackable\" or \"susceptible to government tracking or jamming...Firearms must be able to be disassembled in order to be cleaned and maintained. One of the principles of information security is that someone who has physical access to a machine can undermine its security.\" In a follow up piece published in January 2016, Steinberg noted that smartguns that utilize wireless communications to detect that the shooter is wearing a watch, bracelet, or other device may \"allow criminals (and police) to identify who is carrying a weapon\" undermining \"one of the reasons that some states require people to carry their weapons concealed; if all civilian-carried guns are concealed criminals do not know who is carrying and who is not, so they have to fear mugging everyone, which protects the unarmed as well as the armed.\"\n\nAccording to an article on an NRA website, other concerns are that smart guns may make a firearm more likely to fail when needed for self-defense. \"Batteries go dead, temperature or moisture can harm electronics and many 'smart gun' designs, such as Armatix's iP1, require that a person wear a watch, bracelet, or other device.\" Smart guns may also take considerable time to be ready for firing from a \"cold start.\"\n\nSmart guns are commonly used in science fiction, where they may not only have biometric identification, but also have auto-aiming capabilities or smart bullets. A prominent example is the Lawgiver used by Judge Dredd, which is linked to his DNA. Another is the M56 Smart Gun from Aliens, which is carried via a waist-mounted robotic arm. The concept was later used in a US Army prototype, although engineers moved the mount from the waist to the back, due to ergonomic issues.\n\n\n"}

Rabindra-Biographer Shri Prabhat Kumar Mukherjee wrote in page no.2 of the first volume of his book named \"Rabindrajibani O Rabindra Sahitya Prabeshika\" that, \" The Kusharis were the descendants of Deen Kushari, the son of Bhatta Narayana; Deen was granted a village named Kush (in Burdwan zilla) by Maharaja Kshitisura, he became its chief and came to be known as Kushari.\"\n\nDwarkanath Tagore was a descendant of Rarhiya Brahmins of the Kushari (Sandilya gotra) division. Their ancestors were called Pirali Brahmin, as they were connected to a Brahmin family which had converted to Islam.\n\nHe was the biological son of Rammani Tagore, son of Nilmoni Tagore, through Menoka Devi. But with the death of his mother, early in his birth, he was adopted by Rammani's brother Ramlochan Tagore and his wife Alokasundari Devi, who was incidentally the sister of Menoka Devi. Dwarakanth was the half brother of Radhanath and Ramanath Tagore, sons of Rammoni Tagore through Menoka Devi and Durgamoni Devi respectively.\n\nHe was named so, because the Tagores were Vaishnavites and Alokasundari, Devi considered him as a boon of their \"kuladevata\" i.e. family deity - Radhagobinda, hence named the child as a name of Lord Krishna.\n\nDwarkanath's mother, Alokasundari Devi was a woman of strong personality, which greatly influenced him in his childhood.\n\nHis early education and upbringing was within the family home (\"Thakur Bari\") by Gayanth Bhattacharya \"Tarkalankar\", a pandit from Agradwip. He and his half-elder brother, Radhanath also studied Arabic and Persian under a Muslim cleric at home. At age 10 in 1804, realising the importance of English education, he was admitted to Sherbourne's school on the Chitpur Road by Ramlochan Tagore. Mr Sherbourne, a self-confessed half Brahmin (because of his Bengali Brahmin mother and English father) influenced Dwarkanath deeply with his liberal thoughts and eventually, he became one of Mr Sherbourne's favourite pupils.\n\nOn 12 December 1807, Ramlochan died leaving all his property to his adopted son Dwarkanath, who was then a minor. This property consisted of zamindari estates governed by the complicated Regulations of Permanent Settlement introduced by Lord Cornwallis in 1792. The Zamindars were the ruling authority of a certain sub-division or region under The British ruling authority in India and they (the Zamindars) had the authority to collect tax or to rule their fellow residents inside the territory of their Zamindaris on behalf of the British Government in India. Therefore, to participate in the Zamindari left by his adopted father Ramlochan Thakur as the forthcoming Zamindar, Dwarkanath left school in 1810 at the age of 16 and apprenticed himself under a renowned barrister at Calcutta Robert Cutlar Fergusson and shuttled between Calcutta and his estates at Behrampore and Cuttack.\n\nHis tryst with district magistrate William Willsby, while setting a dispute in Birahimpur, was a testimony to the courage and personality of a 16-year-old standing up to a tyrannical and hot-headed magistrate.\nOn 7 February 1811 Dwarkanath was married to Digambaridevi (then 9 years old) from Jessore.\n\nDwarkanath attained the rare quality of being well versed in languages like English, Bengali, Arabic, Farsi, etc. & also in the legal matters, which he studied under Robert Cutlar Fergusson. He quickly realised the opportunity of enormous income to increase the family wealth (which was not much, compared to the other big zamindars) through translation jobs of property wills & other official documents.\n\nHe took upon his first assignment from the wealthy zamindar of Jessore , Baradakanta Roy, who promised him 2 guineas per line to translate a firman by Murshid Quli Khan from Arabic to English.\n\n\"\"As a zamindar Dwarkanath was mercilessly efficient and businesslike, but not generous\"\". Dwarkanath looked upon his investment in land as an investment in any other business or enterprise and claimed what he deemed a fair return. In later years Dwarkanath would appoint European managers for his estates at Sahajadpur and Behrampore. In time Dwarkanath would convert his estates to integrated commercial-industrial complexes with indigo, silk and sugar factories. In the cut-throat world of zamindari politics, Dwarkanath took no-nonsense and gave no quarter to either European or native. His knowledge of the tenancy laws stood him in good stead. Unlike his good friend Rammohan Roy, who pleaded for the rights of the poor ryots, Dwarkanath Tagore was the best corporate-minded entrepreneur of his contemporary age. His innovative ideas, sharp intelligence, disciplined approaches and dedication established his greatness in the history of Indian entrepreneurs of all time.\n\nIn 1822 Dwarkanath, while carrying on his private ventures, took additional service in the British East India Company as \"Shestidar\" to Trevor Plowden, Collector for the 24 Parganas. Although the pay was meagre at under Rs. 500 per year, the prestige and avenues for additional income were considerable and gave Dwarkanath an intimate insight into the functioning of the government. Trevor Plowden formed a lifelong friendship with Dwarkanath. In 1827 there arose a great scandal in the Salt Revenue department, centred on a dishonest Dewan. Because of Dwarkanath's own personal integrity and character, he was requested to take over as Dewan of the Board. He did not take long to rend asunder the network of corruption which resulted in a counter-petition against him to the Board accusing him of defalcation. To clear his name an enquiry was ordered which at each stage of enquiry – by the Board, by the Governor General and finally by the India Office at London – cleared him unreservedly. By then Dwarkanath had had enough of Government service and resigned in June 1834 to launch into his spectacular career as a full-time entrepreneur.\n\nTagore was a western-educated Bengali Brahmin and an acknowledged civic leader of Kolkata who played a pioneering role in setting up a string of commercial ventures—banking, insurance and shipping companies— in partnership with British traders. In 1828, he became the first Indian bank director. In 1829, he founded Union Bank in Calcutta. He helped found the first Anglo-Indian Managing Agency (industrial organizations that ran jute mills, coal mines, tea plantations, etc.,) Carr, Tagore and Company. Even earlier, Rustomjee Cowasjee, a Parsi in Calcutta, had formed an inter-racial firm but in the early 19th century, Parsis were classified as a Near Eastern community as opposed to South Asian. Tagore's company managed huge zamindari estates spread across today's West Bengal and Odisha states in India, and in Bangladesh, besides holding large stakes in new enterprises that were tapping the rich coal seams of Bengal, running tug services between Calcutta and the mouth of the river Hooghly and transplanting Chinese tea crop to the plains of Upper Assam. Carr, Tagore and Company was one of those Indian private companies engaged in the opium trade with China. Production of opium was in India and it was sold in China. When the Chinese protested, the East India Company transferred the opium trade to the proxy of certain selected Indian companies, of which this was one. In 1832 Tagore purchased the first Indian coal mine in Raniganj, which eventually became the Bengal Coal Company. Very large schooners were engaged in shipments. This made Dwarkanath extremely rich, and there are legends about the extent of his wealth.\n\nDwarkanath Tagore was of the firm conviction that at those times \"the happiness of India is best secured by her connection with England\". Dwarkanath was no doubt a loyalist, and a sincere one at that, but he was by no means a toady. Servility was as far from his character as was lack of generosity from his nature. He was also firm in defending the interest and sentiments of his people against European prejudices. With this in view, he established on 21 March 1838 an Association for Landholders (later known as the \"Landholder's Society\"). The association was overtly a self-serving political association, founded on a large and liberal basis, to admit landholders of all descriptions, Englishmen, Hindus, Muslims, and Christians. What is interesting is that it cut across racial and religious divides being founded along with his old rival Raja Radhakanta Deb with whom he had earlier founded the \"Gaudiya Sabha\". It was the first political association in India to ventilate in a constitutional manner the grievances of the people or a section of them that were outspoken. From this grew the British Indian Association, the precursor to the Indian National Congress.\n\nDwarkanath Tagore died \"at the peak of his fortune\" on the evening of 1 August 1846 at the St. George's Hotel in London during a tremendous thunderstorm with hail the size of walnuts.\n\nHe was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery on 5 August 1846 in a private ceremony without any religious observances. His heart, which had been previously extracted, was sent to Calcutta to conduct the Brahmo rites amidst great controversy. After his death, a Death mask was made. However, the remains of the death mask and his heart have not yet been found in England or India and are presumably lost.\n\nIn his obituary, \"The London Mail\" newspaper of 7 August wrote:\n\nA commemoration, organised by Bengal Heritage Foundation, was held on 11 August 2018 at Kensal Green Cemetery to celebrate Dwarkanath's life and completion of phase 1 of conservation of his monument. Scores of people joined in the commemoration and with eulogies reflecting on business, social and philanthropic contributions.\nJnanadanandini Devi, wife of India's first Civil Servant Satyendranath Tagore, elder brother of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, claimed in her book that while she was in London in 1878, she gave birth to a still-born baby and the baby was buried in Dwarkanath Tagore's grave area. Another two-year-old son of Jnanadanandini Devi, named 'Chobi' died in England during that tour. But it is not clear whether he was also buried in this grave or not.\n\n"}

The seat covers an affluent area in the English county of Surrey.\n\nSince its creation in 1918, East Surrey has elected a Conservative MP on an absolute majority at every general election, and is therefore regarded as a Conservative safe seat. Its greatest share of the vote for any opposition candidate was 33.75% in February 1974.\n\n1832–1868: The Hundreds of Brixton, Kingston, Reigate, Tandridge and Wallington.\n\n1868–1885: The Hundred of Tandridge, and so much of the Hundred of Wallington as included and lay to the east of the parishes of Croydon and Sanderstead, and so much of the Hundred of Brixton as included and lay to the east of the parishes of Streatham, Clapham and Lambeth.\n\n\"For period to 1918 see completely new single-member Wimbledon and Reigate seats, also termed N.E. and S.E. Divisions of Surrey.\"\n\n1918–1950: The Urban Districts of Caterham, and Coulsdon and Purley, and the Rural District of Godstone.\n\n1950–1974: The Urban Districts of Caterham and Warlingham, and Coulsdon and Purley.\n\n1974–1983: The Urban District of Caterham and Warlingham, and the Rural District of Godstone.\n\n1983–1997: The District of Tandridge. (Equivalent to the above)\n\n1997–2010: The District of Tandridge, and the Borough of Reigate and Banstead wards of Horley East and Horley West.\n\n2010–present: As above plus Horley Central.\n\nEast Surrey is a well-connected inner Home Counties seat, combining the town of Horley with Surrey's residual District Tandridge (as opposed to Boroughs which the other 10 parts have been created) which is made up of Caterham and modest commuter settlements, farming and retirement homes. Horley is one of two towns adjoining London Gatwick Airport and part of Reigate and Banstead borough. The area borders the London Borough of Croydon to the north, the county of Kent to the east, and the county of West Sussex to the south.\n\nThe northern part of the seat is inside the M25 motorway — Caterham, Whyteleafe and Warlingham form green-buffered, elevated commuter belt, with good rail connections to Central London and well-connected by all modes of transport to Croydon. Elsewhere, the seat is more rural and includes a low part of the Greensand Ridge and features woodland and many golf courses.\n\nThe Conservatives have prevented any opposition party achieving more than 33.75% of the vote since 1974; including at the 1997 and 2001 United Kingdom general elections when opposition was greatest nationally in Conservative safe seats.\n\nMost local wards are won by the Conservatives with the Liberal Democrats often picking up seats somewhere in the dual-council system, particularly in Whyteleafe or Caterham Valley. As is typical in seats of this kind, the Labour vote is typically very modest. The party finished in third place at the elections between 1959 and 2015. In 2017 the party's candidate polled second, in a poorer showing for the Liberal Democrats and the party's \"Corbyn Surge\". The early twenty-first century saw UKIP poll approximately as strongly as Lib Dems historically. The area saw a majority vote in favour of Brexit in the 2016 EU Referendum; whereas the sitting MP Sam Gyimah opposed Brexit.\n\nThe 13th century-created, dual-member constituency for the county took in over a third of today's Greater London and its population far exceeded the average for a county. It was recognised as needing or meriting four MPs, so division, under the Great Reform Act, 1832.\n\nThe territory was incepted and absorbed two of three of Surrey's rotten boroughs of Bletchingley and Gatton abolished under the Act. It overlapped the boroughs of:\n\nOften known as the Eastern Division of Surrey or Surrey Eastern, its enfranchised adult male property owners elected two MPs by bloc vote (a voter has a vote for each current vacancy). Notable, clockwise from north, outer reaches were Southwark, Rotherhithe, Addington, Lingfield, Charlwood, Buckland, Surrey, Cheam, Kingston upon Thames and Richmond (see map, top right).\n\nThe area was split in two, doubling representation, under the Second Reform Act, starting from the 1868 general election; the area was still under-represented as shown by the setting up of a net increase of 14 metropolitan seats in 1885.\n\nThe Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 went much further than the 1832 Act towards equal representation around the country. It here reflected growth in the county's population. Thus for elections from 1885 dual-member West, Mid Surrey and East Surrey dissipated to allow the creation of 16 rather than just 2 metropolitan Surrey seats (Lambeth and Southwark which saw subdivision) and these \"county\" seats:\n\n\nIn 1918 the constituency was re-established in dwarf form, taking rural and nascent very suburban parts of South East Surrey (\"Reigate\") and North East Surrey (\"Wimbledon\"), and for the first time electing only one MP. It covered from the south of Croydon to the Kent and West Sussex borders. It was to remain entred on Lingfield, Oxted, Limpsfield, Godstone, Caterham and Woldingham.\n\nIn 1950 East Surrey lost Addington parish on the eastern fringe of Croydon to the 1918-formed Croydon South seat, and its southern half to Reigate. In 1974 the north-west of the area became part of Croydon South, reflecting the 1965 transfer of Purley and Coulsdon to the London Borough of Croydon in the new Greater London which then replaced the London County Council. The seat regained essentially the same land as it had lost to Reigate in 1950. Its MP until 1974, William Clark, won the new Croydon South in that year's February election. Clark's successor, Sir Geoffrey Howe, later became Chancellor of the Exchequer and Foreign Secretary in Margaret Thatcher's cabinet.\n\nThis constituency underwent boundary changes between the 1992 and 1997 general elections and thus change in share of vote is based on a notional calculation.\n\nGeneral Election 1939/40:\n\nAnother General Election was required to take place before the end of 1940. The political parties had been making preparations for an election to take place from 1939 and by the end of this year, the following candidates had been selected; \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n"}

It is approximately north of Worksop. Together with the neighbouring mining town of Bircotes, it forms the civil parish of Harworth and Bircotes, with a combined population of nearly 8,000 residents. The population of the civil parish was measured at 7,948 in the 2011 Census. The settlements are part of the modern district of Bassetlaw, which combined the district of Worksop and the district of Retford.\n\nThe Harworth coal mine opened in 1921 and produced coal for the power stations on the River Trent. A new pit tower was built in 1989 when the pit was at its peak of production but seven years later the colliery was 'mothballed'. In 2015, it was announced that the pit tower would be demolished and the colliery site would be used for new housing.\n\nThe town's name is from Old English \"har\" \"grey\" (compare modern hoary\") and\n\"worth\" (also \"worō\", \"worþ\") \"enclosure\".

The allotments were described as \"high and dry and commanding excellent views\" and were convenient to the train, tram and bus services with promises that Ipswich Road and Beaudesert Road would soon be sealed with bitumen. Also in July 1927, Clacher Brothers in conjunction with M.J. Trotter sold the \"Hollywood Estate\", consisting of 24 allotments on the south side of Forrest Street bounded by Fairy Street to the west and an unnamed proposed street (now Vale Street) to the east. In August 1927, the Queensland Development Company sold the \"Mayfield Gardens Estate, consisting of 490 allotments (474 residential and 16 commercial) centred around Vendale Avenue and bounded to the west by Beaudesert Road, to the south by Mayfield Road and to the east by Tarragindi Road.\n\nMoorooka State School opened on 28 January 1929.\n\nSt Brendan's Catholic Primary School was established on 28 January 1929 by the Sisters of St Joseph.\n\nBetween the 1930s and 1969, trams ran along Beaudesert Road, thence along Ipswich Road to the Brisbane CBD. \n\nIn August 1937, auctioneers F.G. Pearce sold a suburban subdivision called Coniston Park Estate, consisting of 96 allotments, bounded by Beaudesert Road, Bracken Street, Margaret Street (now Medina Street) and Sherley Street. The estate was adjacent to Moorooka State School and the Moorooka tram terminus and provided \"extensive views with every convenience\" including electric light, mains water and gas.\n\nMoorooka State Infants School opened on 27 January 1959; it closed on 11 July 1983.\n\nThe Brisbane City Archives (a collection of local historical records dating back to 1859) was established at Moorooka.\n\nIn the , Moorooka had a population of 10,368 people.\n\nMoorooka has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nMoorooka has traditionally hosted a working class population stemming from its history as a manufacturing hub during World War II. The southern part of Moorooka bordering Salisbury was the location of government built returned servicemen housing. Recently Moorooka has seen immigrants from various places of the world, including people from the ex-Yugoslavia (Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia), Middle East (Iraq and Iran) and recently people from Africa (Southern Sudan and Eritrea), which has brought an influx of new families into the area.\n\nIn the the population of Moorooka was 10,368, 50.1% female and 49.9% male. The median age of the Moorooka population was 35 years of age, three years below the Australian median of 38. 67.7% of people living in Moorooka were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.7%. The other top responses for country of birth were New Zealand (3.0%), England (2.6%), India (2.5%), Vietnam (1.0%), Iran (0.8%). 74.2% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 1.4% Vietnamese, 1.1% Spanish, 1.1% Punjabi, 1.0% Mandarin, 0.9% Greek.\n\nThe suburb has mixed uses - large areas, particularly in the elevated eastern side of the suburb are residential. The lower, western side of the suburb is dominated by retail, particularly motor vehicle dealerships along Ipswich Road, known popularly throughout Brisbane as the \"Magic Mile\", light industry and warehouses.\n\nCommuter trains on the Beenleigh line stop at Moorooka railway station.\n\nThe suburb is served by Brisbane Transport buses, namely the 110 Inala-City server, 116 Rocklea-Moorvale service, the 117 Acacia Ridge-City Valley Service, the 124 Sunnybank-City service, and the 125 Garden City-City Valley service. There is a zone border crossing at the Beaudesert Road shops, popularly known as Moorvale, for transport zones 1 and 2.\n\nThe Moorvale Shopping district hosts office for the Brisbane City Council Councillor for Moorooka Ward Steve Griffiths. The office for the Federal Seat of Moreton is in the nearby suburb of Sunnybank.\n\nMoorooka is serviced by two kindergartens.\n\nMoorooka State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Sherley Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 341 students with 34 teachers (25 full-time equivalent) and 24 non-teaching staff (17 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. It has a strong multi-cultural community and hosts an annual Festival in July.\n\nSt Brendan's Primary School is a Catholic primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Hawtree Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 80 students with 15 teachers (10 full-time equivalent) and 13 non-teaching staff (5 full-time equivalent).\n\nThere are no secondary schools in Moorooka. The nearest secondary school is Yeronga State High School in Yeronga.\nMoorooka has two principal churches, the St Brendan's Roman Catholic Church at Hawtree Street and the Church of Christ at Pampas Street and Beaudesert Road. Both feature Sunday services.\nThe principal Moorooka shopping district on Beaudesert Road, known as Moorvale, features over 100 businesses from takeaways to restaurants and coffee shops, discount stores, newsagents, dry cleaners, locksmiths, jewellery shop, second hand and pawn shops, and a new range of businesses that serve the African community including food and groceries, hair salons, furniture shops, and halal butcheries.\n\nMoorvale is also known for its extensive Woolworths Supermarket, at the northern end of the shopping district, which was opened in 1972 and was the largest Woolworths in Queensland at the time.\n\nOn the south end of Moorooka near the AFL club and Moorooka State School located off Beaudesert Road is Pizza Hut, Shear Image Hair & Beauty, now named Harlequin Hair and a petrol station, and within a few blocks either way convenience stores.\n\nMany of the houses are pre-war Queenslanders (on posts, with simple one floor, wooden construction), with small apartment blocks scattered through the suburb. As with many older suburbs of Brisbane, Moorooka is becoming gentrified, with many older homes now being either renovated and extended or replaced by more modern buildings. There are prime real estate areas on the top of hills, with views to the Great Dividing Range over Archerfield in the south, Seventeen Mile Rocks to the west, Mount Coot-tha, St. Lucia, Indooroopilly to the north-west and the city to the north.\n\n"}
{"id": "1809954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809954", "title": "Majesty", "text": "Majesty\n\nMajesty (abbreviation \"HM\" for \"Her/ His Majesty\", oral address \"Your Majesty,\" from the Latin \"maiestas\", meaning \"greatness)\" is used as a manner of address by many monarchs, usually Kings or Queens where used, the style outranks the style of \"(Imperial/Royal) Highness\", but is inferior to the style of \"Imperial Majesty\". It has cognates in many other languages, especially Indo-European languages of Europe.\n\nOriginally, during the Roman republic, the word \"maiestas\" was the legal term for the supreme status and dignity of the state, to be respected above everything else. This was crucially defined by the existence of a specific case, called \"laesa maiestas\" (in later French and English law, \"lèse-majesté\"), consisting of the violation of this supreme status. Various acts such as celebrating a party on a day of public mourning, contempt of the various rites of the state and disloyalty in word or act were punished as crimes against the majesty of the republic. However, later, under the Empire, it came to mean an offence against the dignity of the Emperor.\n\nThe term was first assumed by Charles V, who believed that—following his election as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519—he deserved a style greater than \"Highness\", which preceding emperors and kings had used. Soon, Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England followed his example.\n\nAfter the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, Majesty was used to describe a monarch of the very highest rank— it was generally applied to God. Variations, such as \"Catholic Majesty\" (Spain) or \"Britannic Majesty\" (United Kingdom) are often used in diplomatic settings where there otherwise may be ambiguity (see a list).\n\nA person with the title is usually addressed as \"Your Majesty\", and referred to as \"His/Her Majesty\", abbreviated \"HM\"; the plural \"Their Majesties\" is \"TM\". Emperors (and empresses) use \"[His/Her/Their/Your] Imperial Majesty\", \"HIM\" or \"TIM\".\n\nPrincely and ducal heads usually use \"His Highness\" or some variation thereof (e.g., \"His Serene Highness\"). In British practice, heads of princely states in the British Empire were referred to as Highness.\n\nIn monarchies that do not follow the European tradition, monarchs may be called \"Majesty\" whether or not they formally bear the title of \"King\" or \"Queen\", as is the case in certain countries and amongst certain peoples in Africa and Asia.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, several derivatives of Majesty have been or are used, either to distinguish the British sovereign from continental kings and queens or as further exalted forms of address for the monarch in official documents or the most formal situations. Richard II, according to Robert Lacey in his book Great Tales from English history, was the first English King to demand the title of 'Highness' or 'Majesty.' He also noted that, '...previous English Kings had been content to be addressed as \"My Lord\" '.\n\n\"Most Gracious Majesty\" is only used in the most formal of occasions. Around 1519 King Henry VIII decided Majesty should become the style of the sovereign of England. \"Majesty\", however, was not used exclusively; it arbitrarily alternated with both \"Highness\" and \"Grace\", even in official documents. For example, one legal judgement issued by Henry VIII uses all three indiscriminately; Article 15 begins with, \"The Kinges Highness hath ordered,\" Article 16 with, \"The Kinges Majestie\" and Article 17 with, \"The Kinges Grace.\" \n\nPre-Union Scotland Sovereigns were only addressed as \"Your Grace\". During the reign of James VI and I, Majesty became the official style, to the exclusion of others. In full, the Sovereign is still referred to as \"His (Her) Most Gracious Majesty\", actually a merger of both the Scottish Grace and the English Majesty.\n\n\"Britannic Majesty\" is the style used for the monarch and the crown in diplomacy, the law of nations, and international relations. For example, in the Mandate for Palestine of the League of Nations, it was \"His Britannic Majesty\" who was designated as the Mandatory for Palestine. Britannic Majesty is famously used in all British passports, where the following sentence is used:\n\"Most Excellent Majesty\" is mainly used in Acts of Parliament, where the phrase \"The King's (or Queen's) Most Excellent Majesty\" is used in the enacting clause. The standard is as follows:\n\nIn Empire of China, an honorific () of Emperor of China () only.\n\nIn Japan, an honorific () of Reigning Emperor () only.\n\nIn Brunei, a Malay title for the Sultan of Brunei is officially \"Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda\" (KDYMMPSB) or unofficial simply \"Kebawah Duli\". It literally means \"Under the dust of the Most Exalted [God], The Victorious Sovereign\". \n\nIt reflects the title of \"Zilullah-fil-Alam\" (\"Shadow of God on Earth\"), referring to the Sultan as having a small bit of God's immense power. The title \"paduka\" means \"victorious\" from Old Malay while \"seri\" is an honorific from Sanskrit. The title \"baginda\" is a third-person noun for royals and prophets.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Malay style for the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the Raja Permaisuri Agong is \"Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda\" or simply \"Seri Paduka Baginda\". The Sultan of Johor and the Permaisuri of Johor use the Malay style \"Duli Yang Maha Mulia\" (DYMM) which is equivalent to His/Her Majesty since 2017. Prior to that, they were addressed as \"His/Her Royal Highness\" in English, similar with the other eight royal state Malay rulers in Malaysia.\n"}

Khankai\" (Russian: \"Lake Khankai\"), with \"Khankai\" glossed as signifying \"quiet\", (but given without a Manchu transliteration), and the smaller \"Oz. Dobiku\" (Russian: \"Lake Dobiku\") - given with a Manchu transliteration of \"Dobiku\". From the big lake is shown flowing a river, labelled with the Russian names \"Uzhu\" and \"Sungachan\", with the second of these names being glossed with a Manchu transliteration.\n\nOn the map of 1861 made by 'M. Popov' (= rear-admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov?), the larger lake is given the name \"Kengka\", while the smaller is called \"Ai'-Kengka\" - to which name is added (in brackets) the further name \"Siauhu\" (which can be understood as a transcription of the Chinese \"Xiaohu\", that is, \"Small Lake\").\n\nOn the map of 1864 made by A.F. Budishchev, a captain in the Corps of Foresters, the lake is named as \"Khinkai\" (\"Singkai\").\n\nOn the ethnographic map of Shrenk the abbreviated Russian names \"Oz. Khanka\" and \"Oz. Mal. Khanka\" (\"Lake Khanka\" and \"Little / Lesser Lake Khanka\") are used. \n\nExplorer, traveler, naturalist and writer Vladimir Arsenyev (1872-1930) wrote, concerning the name of the lake: \"In the Liao Dynasty, Khanka Lake was called \"Beitsin-hai\", but it is now known as \"Khanka\", \"Khinkai\" and \"Sinkai-hu\", meaning \"Lake of Prosperity\". It must be assumed that the name \"Khanka\" originated from another word, namely \"khanhai\", meaning \"hollow\" - a name by which the Chinese call every low place...Subsequently, the Russians must have changed this word to its current form of \"Khanka\". \"\n\nLake Khanka is an ancient lake, rich in fish and bird species - a richness reflected in the ancient name \"Khankai-Omo\" - \"Sea of bird feathers\". Likewise, in the Middle Ages, the fish fauna of Lake Khanka furnished the tables of both Chinese and Jurchen emperors with an abundance of delicacies.\n\nIn 1868, Nikolay Przhevalsky visited Lake Khanka, leaving for posterity his descriptions of the flora and fauna of the lake and its surroundings. It was thirty-four years later, in 1902, that the explorer Vladimir Arsenyev made his first expedition to the area.\n\nLake Khanka, the largest lake in Primorsky Krai, is located in the centre of the Khankan lowland on the border with the People's Republic of China in Heilongjiang Province. The northern part of the lake is in Chinese territory. The lake is pear-shaped, with an extension in its northern part. The surface area of the water is highly variable, depending on climate conditions. The maximum extension reaches , the minimum extension is . The length of the lake is about , the maximum width is . There are 24 rivers flowing into Lake Khanka, with only one outflow: Songacha River, which connects it with the Ussuri, and that in turn with the Amur River system.\n\nLake Khanka is a shallow body of water, with an average depth of and a prevailing depth of ; the greatest depth is . Its average volume is , though it can fill up to The water in the lake is cloudy, which is explained by frequent winds and, as a result, strong mixing. On average, the water inflow is about per year, and the outflow about .\n\nOn the northern (Chinese) shore, lies Little Lake Khanka (; Russian: о́зеро Малая Ха́нка, \"ozero Malaya Khanka\"), separated from Lake Khanka proper by a narrow sandy spit.\n\nKhanka Lake freezes in the second half of November and thaws in April.\n\nThe fauna and flora of Lake Khanka are rich in species. In 1971, the Ramsar Convention gave the lake the status of a wetland of international importance. In 1990, the Khanka Nature Reserve was organized in part of the then-Soviet basin of Lake Khanka. In April 1996, an agreement was signed between the Governments of the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China on the establishment of an international Russian-Chinese nature reserve around the lake, from the Khankai Reserve in Russia and the Chinese Singkai-Hu Reserve.\n\nThe wetlands of the Lake Khanka basin (Водно-болотные угодья озера Ханка, \"Vodno-bolotnye ugod'ya ozera Khanka\") represent a unique natural complex. The lowland of the Prihanka and, in fact, the shores of the lake represent a fairly swampy terrain. So-called melt-plant communities, formed by various species of sedge and grass, form a solid turf covering the water mirror for many tens of square kilometers. Diverse ecosystems are represented, such as meadows (from marshy to steppe), meadow forest, forest-steppe and steppe plant communities. In the lake itself there are many species of fish and aquatic invertebrates, many of which are endemic. In the lake there live 52 species of fish, among them such as carp, perch, silver carp, catfish, and snakehead. A variety of birds nest and stop on the lake or its banks.\n\nThe lake's drainage basin covers an area of , of which 97% is in Russian territory. It is fed by 23 rivers (8 in China and 15 in Russia), but the only outflow of the lake is the Songacha River.\n\nThe maximum monthly mean temperature is in July, while the minimum monthly mean temperature is in January. Rainfall mainly occurs in summer, with average annual precipitation of 500–650 mm annually.\n\nThe residence time of Lake Khanka is 9.9 years.\n\nPopular Culture: The surveyors in the 1975 Akira Kurosawa film \"Dersu Uzala\" were sent to explore the Lake Khanka region.\n\nThe lake is an important area for birds, and includes a number of endangered species.\n"}
{"id": "1809960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809960", "title": "Clevedon Pier", "text": "Clevedon Pier\n\nClevedon Pier is a seaside pier in the town of Clevedon, Somerset, England on the east shore of the Severn Estuary. It was described by Sir John Betjeman, as \"the most beautiful pier in England\" and was designated a Grade I listed building in 2001.\n\nThe pier was built during the 1860s to attract tourists and provide a ferry port for rail passengers to South Wales. The pier is long and consists of eight spans supported by steel rails covered by wooden decking, with a pavilion on the pier head.\n\nThe pier opened in 1869 and served as an embarkation point for paddle steamer excursions for almost exactly 100 years. Two of the spans collapsed during stress testing in 1970 and demolition was proposed, but local fund raising and heritage grants allowed the pier to be dismantled for restoration and reassembled. It reopened in 1989, and ten years later was awarded the Pier of the Year from the National Piers Society, and a Civic Trust Award. The pier now, once again, offers a landing stage for steamers and is a popular attraction for tourists and anglers.\n\nThe pier projects from the seafront at Clevedon into the Severn Estuary, which separates South West England from South Wales. The pier and toll house, where entry fees are collected, are adjacent to the Royal Pier Hotel, originally known as The Rock House and built in 1823 by Thomas Hollyman.\n\nThe shore at Clevedon is a mixture of pebbled beaches and low rocky cliffs, with the old harbour being at the western edge of the town at the mouth of the Land Yeo river. The rocky beach has been designated as the Clevedon Shore geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is the side of a mineralised fault, which runs east–west adjacent to the pier, and forms a small cliff feature in Dolomitic Conglomerate on the north side of Clevedon Beach, containing cream to pink baryte together with sulfides. The minerals identified at the site include: haematite, chalcopyrite, tennantite, galena, tetrahedrite, bornite, pyrite, marcasite, enargite and sphalerite. Secondary alteration of this assemblage has produced idaite, covellite and other copper sulfides. The nearest parking to the pier entrance is on an esplanade above the rocky beach.\n\nDuring the Victorian era, Clevedon became a popular seaside town, having previously been an agricultural village. Due to improving transport links, via the Clevedon Branch Line, Clevedon was able to cater for the late 19th century craze for bathing in the sea with saltwater baths adjacent to the pier (since demolished, though the foundations can still be seen), and bathing machines on the main beach. Many English seaside resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists. At Clevedon tourism grew following the opening of a branch line from Yatton railway station which connected it to the Bristol to Exeter line, enabling travel from the rest of the country. It was also proposed that a pier could form part of a route from London to South Wales with the use of steamers to cross the Severn Estuary. An enabling act was submitted to parliament in 1864.\n\nIn November 1866, the Clevedon Pier Company was formed at a public meeting in the town. The directors included Sir Arthur Elton of Clevedon Court. Construction of the pier started at a cost of £10,000, with John William Grover and Richard Ward as the engineers and Hans Price as the architect. The erection of the iron pillars was undertaken by Hamilton Windsor Ironworks Co. of Garston, Liverpool. The legs were constructed from Barlow rail which had previously been used on Isambard Kingdom Brunel's South Wales Railway, with wood planks for the decking. By August 1868 of the pier had been built and the final section was completed by February 1869.\n\nThe pier is long and above high water. Each of the eight spans is long. The legs are made up of Barlow rails which are riveted together; one of the rails separates from the main support close to the deck at the top, forming a transverse truss joining a rail from the opposite leg of the pier and longitudinal bracing is provided by further rails. The supporting piles, which are made of cast iron, are in diameter at the seabed. In total approximately 370 tons of wrought iron was used.\n\nThe Severn Estuary has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world, up to , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range, and the underlying geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The tidal range means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide and the landing stage at the end of the pier has several levels to allow boats to dock at all stages of the tide.\n\nThe pier was officially opened on 29 March 1869, with a parade, bands and a cannon volley by the First Somerset Artillery.\n\nThe number of rail passengers crossing to South Wales, which had been envisaged, was reduced after the opening of the Severn Tunnel in 1886. The tunnel linked South Gloucestershire in the west of England to Monmouthshire in south Wales, under the estuary of the River Severn. The paddle steamer \"Waverley\" first visited the pier to take on passengers in 1886, and along with sister ships of the White Funnel Fleet belonging to P and A Campbell provided excursions around the Bristol Channel. Other ships of the fleet including \"Ravenswood\", \"Westward Ho\", \"Cambria\" and \"Britannia\" regularly called at Clevedon. Other companies, including the Cardiff-based Edwards, Robertson & Co., eventually taken over by Campbells, visited Clevedon Pier.\n\nIn 1893 the pier head was replaced in cast iron with a new timber landing stage, and the pier head pavilion was completed in 1894. The Toll House on the pier and the adjacent Royal Pier Hotel were both designed by local architect Hans Price. In 1899, of the decking was washed away by a storm, and in 1910, part of the landing stage was damaged in another storm and replaced by a concrete landing stage in 1913.\n\nThe pier continued to flourish between the First and Second World Wars and into the 1960s, and was visited frequently by P&A Campbell's steamers. The and were regular visitors.\n\nOn 16 October 1970, spans 7 and 8 of the pier collapsed during stress testing, which had been introduced in the 1950s as a requirement for obtaining insurance cover. The tests involved the placement of polythene tanks long, wide and deep filled to a depth of , which created a pressure of . This simulated the required load agreed with the Ministry of Transport.\n\nSix tanks were used for each span and left in place for three hours; the 18 tanks used in total allowed three spans to be tested simultaneously. At the end of the three hours the tanks were emptied and dragged along the deck to test further spans. The first six spans passed without problems, but under load the seventh span collapsed, bringing down the eighth and final span, leaving the pier head and pavilion standing.\n\nThe Clevedon Pier Preservation Society was formed in 1972 and started campaigning for the restoration of the pier. The district council applied for permission to demolish the pier in 1979, but a public enquiry the following year ruled that it should be retained. The pavilions from the end of the pier were taken ashore in 1982 for storage in anticipation of eventual restoration; insufficient funds were available to complete restoration and the first stage was to open the Toll House as an exhibition centre in 1984.\n\nA major breakthrough came in 1984, when English Heritage and the National Heritage Memorial Fund granted a million pounds towards the restoration, with smaller sums from Woodspring District Council and other funding bodies. The trust, which had been formed by the preservation society, also obtained a 99-year lease. The pier was dismantled in 1985, taken to Portishead dock for restoration, and reconstructed in 1986.\n\nAfter a long campaign by local people to raise funds for restoration (supported by Sir John Betjeman, who described Clevedon as \"the most beautiful pier in England\"), the pier eventually reopened. Some funds were raised by \"sponsored planks\" – small brass plaques with names or messages are inlaid on the wooden planks and benches, recording donations. Reconstruction of the pier spans and decking was completed on 27 May 1989, and the pier was reopened to great enthusiasm. The pierhead was still shut, however, and it was not until 23 May 1998 that it was finally restored and opened to the public, as a result of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. In 1999 the National Piers Society awarded Clevedon Pier the title of Pier of the Year, and it also won a Civic Trust Award. The pier was re-designated a Grade 1 listed building in 2001, the only other pier with this status being Brighton's West Pier (largely destroyed by fire and storms between 2002 and 2004).\n\nThe landing stage at the end of the pier is used throughout the summer season (June to September) by the \"Waverley\" and her sister ship, the \"Balmoral\", and is a popular spot for angling. There is a cafe at the pierhead, and a souvenir shop at the toll house. The upper floor of the toll house is an art gallery with a different exhibition every month. The pier is open every day of the year except Christmas Day. Scenes from the 2010 film, \"Never Let Me Go\", starring Keira Knightley were filmed near Clevedon pier during 2009, and the pier also featured on the promotional posters. One Direction's music video for their single \"You & I\" was filmed on Clevedon Pier. An appeal was launched in 2012 to raise £1.6 million for a new visitor centre and educational facility, an additional £800,000 of grants have been applied for to cover the cost of repainting the legs of the structure. In December 2012 it was announced that the pier had received £720,000 of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund to improve the visitor centre.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1809961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809961", "title": "Eyüp", "text": "Eyüp\n\nEyüp () or Eyüpsultan is a municipality () and district of the city of İstanbul, Turkey. The district extends from the Golden Horn all the way to the shore of the Black Sea. Eyüp is also the name of a prominent neighborhood and former village in the district, located at the confluence of the Kâğıthane and Alibey streams at the head of the Golden Horn. The Eyüp neighborhood is a historically important area, especially for Turkey's Muslims. It became district centre in 1936, after some parts of Fatih, Çatalca and Sarıyer was joined together; later for some time it also included Gaziosmanpaşa and Bayrampaşa districts. Its present boundaries were established after the borough of Yayla was given to Sultangazi in 2009. Its neighbours are Sarıyer in the east, Kâğıthane and Beyoğlu in the southeast, Gaziosmanpaşa, Fatih and Sultangazi in the south, Başakşehir in the southwest and Arnavutköy in the west.\n\nModern Eyüp was the site of a settlement already in the Byzantine period, best known as Kosmidion (). Its name derives from the local monastery of the Anargyroi (Saints Cosmas and Damian), which was established in the 5th century. According to a later legend, it was founded by the \"magister\" Paulinus, who was executed by Theodosius II (r. 408–450) when the latter suspected him—erroneously—of having an affair with empress Aelia Eudocia. In reality, however, the monastery was probably founded ca. 480 by Paulina, the mother of the general and failed usurper Leontius. From her, the quarter was initially known as \"ta Paoulines\" (τα Παυλίνης, \"Paulina's [quarter]\"). The monastery was of some importance in the 6th century: its abbots participated in synods of 518 and 536, a collection of miracles associated with its patron saints appeared, and the monastery received a major renovation as part of the building programme of Justinian I (r. 527–565). In 623 and again in 626, the site was besieged and looted by the Avars.\n\nBy the early 10th century, the quarter that grew around the monastery had become known as \"Kosmidion\"; alternatively, but less likely, Kosmidion and ta Paoulines may have been neighbouring but separate localities. In 924, Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–944) met with the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon at a pier in Kosmidion during the Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 913–927. Theophylact Lekapenos, Romanos' son and Patriarch of Constantinople in 933–956, had his stables there.\n\nEmperor Michael IV (r. 1034–41) renovated the monastery complex anew, and retired there following his abdication. He died there as a monk soon after. Due to its proximity to Constantinople, the site played a role in the civil wars of the period: it was the headquarters of the rebel Leo Tornikios (although other sources place his headquarters at Thermopolis) during his failed siege of the imperial capital in 1047, it was a base of John Bryennios, brother of the rebel general Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder, in 1077, and four years later, it was one of the first localities taken over by the Komnenoi in their successful coup against Nikephoros III Botaneiates (r. 1078–81). In 1096, the newly arrived First Crusade was allowed to encamp between Kosmidion and Hagios Phokas.\n\nDuring the Fourth Crusade, Kosmidion was the site of one of the first skirmishes between the Crusaders and the Byzantines in July 1203, from which the Crusaders emerged victorious. In April 1204, shortly before the fall of the city to the Crusaders, the Venetian Doge Enrico Dandolo met with the newly crowned emperor Alexios V Mourtzouphlos for negotiations there.\n\nUnder Latin rule, the monastery seems not to have suffered too much; certainly it was fit to lodge Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–82) on the night of 14 August 1261, before his triumphal entry into recently recovered Constantinople the next day. In the next decades, the monastery was used as a place of exile for two disgraced patriarchs, Joseph I in 1280–82 and John XI Bekkos in 1285, while awaiting trial by the synod, and Athanasius I for the period before his abdication in 1293. A collection of miracles attributed to the monastery's patron saints since 1261 was compiled in ca. 1300 by a certain deacon Maximos.\n\nIn 1303 Catalan mercenaries in imperial service took over and fortified the monastery complex as a base of operations against the Genoese colony of Galata. Following the breach between the Empire and the Catalan Company in 1305, however, the Byzantines evacuated the site. In the 1348 war with the Genoese, the latter captured and burned all Byzantine ships in the Golden Horn, except the three being built in a dockyard in Kosmidion. In 1350 the monastery was visited by the Russian pilgrim Stephen of Novgorod. At about the same time, the existence of a church dedicated to a St. Theodore, as well as a chapel dedicated to the martyrs Thalelaios and Artemidoros, is known, without further information.\n\nIn 1410, during the Ottoman Interregnum, the contenders for the Ottoman throne, Musa Çelebi and Süleyman Çelebi, clashed at Kosmidion, with the latter emerging as the victor. \n\nAfter the Fall of Constantinople, the quarter was renamed after Abu Ayyub al-Ansari (Eyüp in Turkish), a companion (\"Ansari\") of Muhammad who fell in the First Arab Siege of Constantinople in 674–678. In 1581, Christians were prohibited from living there.\n\nThe area has long been used as a place of burial, largely due to its position outside the city of Istanbul. There are Christian churches and cemeteries as well as a large Muslim burial ground, the Eyüp Cemetery. The major Muslim shrine gives the area its current name and prominence.\n\nMuslim sources report that several important personalities of early Islam took part in the 674–678 siege, such as Ibn Abbas, Ibn Umar and Ibn al-Zubayr. Abu Ayyub eventually emerged as the most prominent among them. According to Muslim tradition, Constantine IV threatened to destroy his tomb, but the Caliph warned that if he did so, the Christians under his rule would suffer. Thus the tomb was left in peace, and allegedly became a site of veneration by the Byzantines, who prayed there in times of drought. The tomb was \"rediscovered\" after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 by the dervish Sheikh Ak Shams al-Din, and Sultan Mehmed II (r. 1444–1446, 1451–1481) ordered the construction of a marble tomb and the Eyüp Sultan Mosque adjacent to it. It became a tradition that Ottoman sultans were girt with the Sword of Osman at the Eyüp mosque upon their accession.\n\nFrom that point on, Eyüp became a sacred place. Relics were displayed in the tomb, including a stone said to bear the footprint of the Prophet Muhammad. More mosques, schools, tekkes, and fountains were built, and since many Ottoman officials wished to be buried near Abu Ayyub's resting place, the cemetery became one of Istanbul's most desirable.\n\nAt the height of the Ottoman Empire, Eyüp was one of the most recognized urban areas outside the city walls. \n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Istanbul grew as the fringes of the Ottoman Empire became unsettled and refugees from Turkish communities in the Balkans and the Caucasus came to the city. During this period the Eyüp area was incorporated into the city, losing some of its spiritual air as factories were built along the Golden Horn. The first of these was the Feshane, the factory beside the Golden Horn where fezzes were manufactured for the Ottoman armies. The Feshane is today an exhibition center owned by the Istanbul municipality.\n\nIn the meantime, industry, the growing population, and the continuing flow of pilgrims encouraged the growth of the shopping district around and behind the mosque. The streets behind had fish and dairy markets, shops, cafes and bars for residents of the area, while the courtyard of the mosque itself had people selling scriptures and prayer beads to visitors.\n\nFrom the mid-20th century onward, the area took on a more \"working class\" feel as wealthier residents of Istanbul preferred to buy housing on the Asian side of the city or along the Bosphorus, since the Golden Horn was becoming increasingly polluted and unpleasant due to industrial development. The industrial zone expanded as major roads were built through the Eyüp area. The market gardens and flower fields of Alibeyköy disappeared.\n\nIn recent years many of the factories have been closed or cleaned up, the Golden Horn no longer smells so bad, and it is possible to sit by the waterside. The area has also increasingly attracted conservative Muslim families.\n\nThe Eyüp Sultan Mosque continues to draw tourists visiting Istanbul, as well as larger numbers of Turkish religious pilgrims. At Friday prayer and throughout Ramadan, the area is full of visitors from all over the city. Pilgrims to the mosque include a wide range of Muslims, especially before weddings or circumcisions. \n\nIn recent years, a thriving market has grown around the mosque selling prayer mats, beads, dates from Saudi Arabia, scented oils, Islamic books, recordings of Koran recitation, and other items. On Fridays, a marching band plays Ottoman military music, mehter, giving the area around the mosque a carnival atmosphere with an Islamic twist. In Ramadan, the area in front of the mosque is taken over by large tents where food is served at the evening fast breaking.\n\nThe main building of the 2010-established Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University is situated in a historic building in Eyüp.\n\nA gondola lift brings visitors from the shore of the Golden Horn up to the outdoor Pierre Loti Café (), a popular spot offering a panoramic view of the Golden Horn, named after the 19th-century French writer Pierre Loti (pseudonym of Julien Viaud), who wrote two novels based on his stay in Istanbul.\n\n"}

He was assassinated by the MEK on 23 August 1998.\n\nLajevardi was born in Tehran in 1935. He studied theological sciences before working as a bazaar draper.\n\nHe was one of the co-founders of Islamic Coalition \"Hey'at\"s, later Islamic Coalition Party.\n\nLajevardi was a follower of Ayatollah Kashani and Fadayian Islam. He was arrested and convicted on three occasions for militant activities. In 1964, he served 18 months for taking part in the assassination of the late Iranian prime minister Mansour. Later in 1970, he served three years in Evin prison for attempting to blow up the offices of El Al (the Israeli airline) in Tehran. Finally, he was once again arrested and sentenced to 18 years in prison, for being a member of the opposition militant group People's Mujahedin of Iran. He was among those who visited Ayatollah Khomeini in Paris when the latter was in exile.\n\nIn 1979, with the onset of the Iranian Revolution, Lajevardi was appointed as the chief prosecutor of Tehran on Mohammad Beheshti's recommendation. Lajevardi was given the extra post of warden in June 1981 after the first post-revolutionary warden of Evin, Mohammad Kachouyi, was assassinated. According to Ervand Abrahamian, Lajevardi \"liked to be addressed as Hajj Aqa, and boasted he was so proud of Evin that he had brought his family to live there.\" He was temporarily removed from his post in 1984, but continued to live at Evin with his family to avoid assassination.\n\nLadjevardi maintained that the Islamic Republic had converted prisons into 'rehabilitation centers' and 'ideological schools', where inmates studied Islam, learned the errors of their ways, and did penance before returning to society. As the chief warden at Evin, the main political prison in Tehran, Ladjevardi \"boasted that more than 95 percent of his 'guests' eventually oblige him with his sought-after videotaped 'interview'\"—i.e., a confession of their political errors and praise of the Islamic Republic and the prison staff.\n\nHowever to his critics, he was known as \"the butcher of Evin Prison\" with dreadful, religiously fanatic, and thuggish narcissist mannerisms. The number of executions under his supervision is estimated to be roughly around 2500 according to one account. In her memoir, \"Iran Awakening,\" Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Shirin Ebadi states that an estimated 4000-5000 members and supporters of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MKO) were executed during a three-month period in 1988 immediately following the failed \"Mersad\" rebellion, which was launched upon the end of the Iran–Iraq War by MKO fighters based in Iraq. According to Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri, Lajevardi's close relations with some of the prisoned members of Furqan group made them \"repent\". Lajevardi's son, Sayyid Ehsan, described his father as being both decisive and kind.\n\nLajevardi was appointed minister of commerce to the cabinet of then prime minister Mohammad Ali Rajai on 1 September 1980.\n\nOn 23 August 1998, on the tenth anniversary of the mass executions, Ladjevardi was assassinated by members of the People's Mujahedin of Iran. Using an Uzi submachine gun the activists opened fire on Lajevardi and his bodyguard (who was also killed) at Lajevardi's tailor-shop in Tehran Bazaar.\n\nFollowing his assassination, the Mojahedin Command Headquarters inside Iran issued a statement that reads\n\"Assadollah Lajevardi, the infamous 'Butcher of Evin,' who was accompanied by a special group of bodyguards made up of Revolutionary Guards and armed agents of the notorious secret police, the Ministry of Intelligence, was killed at midday today in an operation carried out by Mojahedin's Resistance units in Tehran.\"\n\nThe statement, claimed Lajevardi directly responsible for the execution of tens of thousands of political prisoners ... raped and executed hundreds of women ... made it a common practice in prisons to torture prisoners in front of their parents, husbands or wives and children ... devised a plan to set up forced labor camps for political prisoners on a nationwide scale ... and though retired was continuing \"his crimes under various covers\" including as a tailor in Tehran's Bazaar.\n\n"}

It was formed on 1 January 2005, by the merger of the University of the North and the Medical University of South Africa (MEDUNSA). These previous institutions formed the Turfloop and MEDUNSA campuses of the university, respectively. In 2015 the MEDUNSA campus split and became the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University.\n\nThe University of the North, nicknamed \"Turfloop\" after its location, was established in 1959 under the apartheid regime's policy of separate ethnically-based institutions of higher learning policy. The university was sited at Turfloop farm about east of Pietersburg. The town that grew around the university was named Sovenga, for the three ethnic groups (Sotho, Venda, Tsonga) that Apartheid ideology intended to study there. In reality, most inhabitants refer to the town as Mankweng, after one of the chiefs of the area. Under later apartheid, the University of the North served as a \"model\" university where dignitaries were brought to show the \"viability\" of the separate facilities. As such, it received heavy government subsidies, but the real problem was that the students that the university supposedly served were so under-resourced in their standard education that the quality of instruction was placed under incredible demands.\n\nThe university was a centre of resistance to apartheid in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s with the SADF occupying the grounds often during those years. After the end of apartheid, the university struggled through various re-organization and rationalization schemes, yet always managed to survive. Enrollment fluctuated wildly in the years after liberation and while some faculty did not transition very easily, others were able to seize upon the new opportunities.\n\nThe University of Limpopo is the result of a merger between the former Medical University of Southern Africa and the University of the North, which occurred on 1 January 2005.\n\nThe extension of University Education Act of 1959 made provision for the establishment of racially exclusive universities for black South Africans. Under the provisions of the Act, the University College of the North was established about thirty kilometres from the Limpopo Province town of Polokwane on 1 August 1959. The College was placed under the academic trusteeship of the University of South Africa. This formative relationship was maintained until the South African Parliament promulgated the University of the North Act (Act No. 47 of 1969) thus bringing to an end the College status as of 1 January 1970.\n\nThe University is in the foothills of the Hwiti (Wolkberg range) in Mankweng township, midway between Polokwane and Magoebaskloof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In Ottoman times the inhabitants of this fishing and farming village were mainly Greek, and these people were swapped for Turkish residents of Thessalonica, Kavala and Drama in the population exchange following the foundation of the Turkish Republic in the early 1920s.\n\nThere are still fishing boats, but by the end of the 1980s, fishing had been overtaken by industry, particularly shipbuilding; the shipyards of Tuzla are still active today. There is still some farming going on inland from the town of Tuzla, although there is also industrial development. \n\nTuzla is a small town famous for its sea front and its many fish restaurants. It is also a popular location for wealthy Istanbul residents or the retired to buy homes as it is far from the city, less crowded and still retains a 'small town feel' to it. Travelling to Kadıköy from Tuzla by public transport takes about an hour to 40 minutes by train or bus. The European side transit hubs of Eminönü and Beşiktaş are another thirty minutes away by ferry.\n\nThere is a wetland inland from the coast, important for bird life, but it has deteriorated badly as the town of Tuzla has grown, and some factories are dumping their waste into the lagoon. Today, the biggest problems in Tuzla are air pollution and ecology in general. \n\nRecently, Tuzla has become known for frequent deaths of the shipyard workers. The government is being criticised for not controlling illegal employment and not forcing companies to maintain better working conditions. Companies claim that they contribute great amounts to the Turkish economy and low-paid workers are their advantage. In February and March 2008, thousands of workers went on strike for better wages and conditions. The police intervened in the demonstrations, and 86 workers were taken into police custody, 15 of them injured.\n\n\nThe mayor of Tuzla throughout the 1990s was İdris Güllüce, a leading figure in the conservative Justice and Development Party (AK Party).\n\n"}

With a population of 400,000 plus, it is one of the most populous districts. In 2009 Gaziosmanpaşa district was divided into three districts: Gaziosmanpaşa, the central; Sultangazi, the northern part; and Arnavutköy, the northernmost part. Esenler and Bayrampaşa are at west, Sultangazi is at north and Eyüp is at south and east of district. It was formed from parts of Eyüp and Çatalca districts in 1963.\n\nThe district was named after Gazi Osman Pasha (1832–1900), a prominent Ottoman general who was active in the Balkans. the area was empty, rocky pasture until the 1950s when immigrants from the Balkans (especially from Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Western Thrace) settled here. Much of their housing was illegally built, primitive tiny cottages. Gaziosmanpaşa expanded rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s due to migration from eastern Anatolia. The population is still growing with half the people under 20 years old. NBA's Orlando Magic star, Hedo Türkoğlu, who played in the 2009 NBA Finals, was born in the district. The NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers center Semih Erden was also born in the district.\n\nThe centre of Gaziosmanpaşa is still inhabited by the descendants of the 1950s and 1960s Balkan immigrants. Now most of the original illegal houses are being pulled down and replaced with semi-legal blocks of flats to house the children and grandchildren.\n\nOther areas, often isolated communities far out of the city, are dominated by populations of migrants from Anatolia. These areas are an ethnic, religious and political melting pot. In particular, one area of Gaziosmanpaşa has a substantial population of migrants from Dersim Province, a province mainly populated by people who claim both Kurdish and Zaza identities. The mixture of people plus the number of young people in the communities has at times given Gaziosmanpaşa the unfortunate reputation for being the centre of crime and of left- and right-wing violence in Istanbul.\n\nThe city council is trying to spend its way out of this situation by putting in sports facilities, theatres, shopping centres and better transport to the city. But still more and more housing is being built. As the area has grown without sufficient control or regulations the city is still struggling to put in schools and other infrastructure throughout Gaziosmanpaşa to support the population, while industrial development is taking place too.\n\nThe area itself suffers from unemployment despite the industry coming in, and the main employers are small workshops producing light fittings, electrical goods, clothing, lathe and metalwork and car repairs.\n\nUrban renewal projects aim to revitalize the district through increasing housing prices.\n\n\n"}

During his career, Deisler was employed as right winger and attacking midfielder.\n\nHaving been hailed as the future of German football at the turn of the millennium, Deisler could never manage to reach his full potential due to several cruciate ligament ruptures and other major injuries, as well as depression. Deisler retired from professional football in January 2007 at the age of 27.\n\nDeisler joined his first club, FV Turmringen, when he was only six. At age 15, he was scouted and signed by the Bundesliga outfit Borussia Mönchengladbach and played for the club at junior level from 1995 to 1998. He started his professional career at the club in 1998, making his Bundesliga debut against Eintracht Frankfurt on 8 September. During the 1998–99 season he made 17 Bundesliga appearances and scoring one goal, in a 2–0 win over 1860 München. However the \"Foals\" finished in last place and were relegated to the second division.\n\nAs Borussia Mönchengladbach were relegated at the end of the season, Deisler moved on to Hertha BSC for 4.5m DM. The Berlin club offered a participation in the 1999–2000 Champions League.

Deisler was to join Bayern at the beginning of the 2002–03 season and had received a sum of DEM 20 million from the club. Deisler faced immense critique from the fans and the media for not having announced the agreement earlier as well as accepting the payment.

Deisler arrived at Bayern injured as he had injured his right knee the season before. Unfortunately, Deisler's time at the club was a turbulent one as Deisler only managed 62 league appearances in four and a half years. Due to his injuries, he was unable to establish himself as a constant starter over a longer period of time. At the same time, Deisler struggled to endure the pressure he was exposed to at Bayern and developed a depression for which he was treated as a stationary patient in a Munich clinic from November 2003. After several months, Deisler rejoined the squad, but suffered a relapse in October 2004.\n\nDeisler looked to finally break into Bayern's first team from 2004–05 on and was able to play for the most part of 2005. After Michael Ballack's departure to Chelsea, Deisler was about to become the chief in the Bayern midfield. However, he damaged the synovial membrane in his right knee again in March 2006 and missed the World Cup on home soil. Although Deisler came back in November, he felt exhausted and, citing his lack of confidence in ever regaining the necessary stability in his often-injured knee, he announced his retirement on 16 January 2007. Bayern manager Uli Hoeneß stated that Deisler's contract, which ran until 30 June 2009, would not be dissolved but instead be in abeyance. Deisler later stated that he came to the conclusion that he was not made for the football business.\n\nDeisler played for the German national team between 2000 and 2006, winning 36 international caps and scoring three goals. He made his debut for the team in a friendly match against the Netherlands on 23 February 2000 and was also part of the German squad at the Euro 2000 finals four months later, appearing in all three group matches before the Germans disappointingly exited the competition in the first round. On 2 September 2000, he scored his first goal for Germany as he opened their 2–0 win over Greece in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying.\n\nDue to injuries, he missed both the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, the latter being held in Germany, as well as UEFA Euro 2004. In 2005, he appeared in all of the German team's five matches at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany. His last match for the German national team was a friendly against Italy on 1 March 2006.\n\n\"Scores and results list Germany's goal tally first. Score column indicates score after each Deisler goal.\"\n\n\n\nDeisler has a Brazilian wife named Eunice Dos Santos Santana. The couple have a son named Raphael.\n\nThe level of formal education he reached is technical college. He mentions basketball, food, music and movies as his hobbies.\n\nIn September 2007, Deisler stated that he was in the process of writing a book. The book was released in 2009.\nNow Deisler lives in Freiburg.\n\n"}

The University of the Western Cape has a history of creative struggle against oppression, discrimination and disadvantage. Among academic institutions it has been in the vanguard of South Africa's historic change, playing a distinctive academic role in helping to build an equitable and dynamic nation. UWC's key concerns with access, equity and quality in higher education arise from extensive practical engagement in helping the historically marginalised participate fully in the life of the nation. The university was established in 1960 by the South African government as a university for Coloured people only. Other universities near Cape Town are the University of Cape Town, (UCT, originally for English speaking whites), Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) and the Stellenbosch University (originally for Afrikaans speaking whites). The establishing of UWC was a direct effect of the Extension of University Education Act, 1959. This law accomplished the segregation of higher education in South Africa. Coloured students were only allowed at a few non-white universities. In this period, other \"ethnical\" universities, such as the University of Zululand and the University of the North, were founded as well. Since well before the end of apartheid in South Africa in 1994, it has been an integrated and multiracial institution.\n\nUWC started as a \"bush college\", a university college without autonomy under auspices of the University of South Africa. The university offered a limited training for lower to middle level positions in schools and civil service. In the first years of its existence, a great deal of the teaching staff was white. Many of the lecturers came from the University of Stellenbosch. The language in most lectures was Afrikaans. The first rector was N.J. Sieberhagen (from 1960 till 1973). The university started as a small institution: in the first year, 166 students were enrolled and the teaching staff numbered 17. In 1970, the institution gained university status and was able to award its own degrees and diplomas.\n\nDuring the first 15 years, the board and staff were primarily whites, supporting the National Party and apartheid. One of the few exceptions was Adam Small, head of the Philosophy Department. Small was dismissed in 1973 as a consequence of his involvement in the Black Consciousness Movement. Apart from lecturers like Small, there were many students who were active in the struggle against apartheid, and who were loyal to the Black Consciousness Movement. Protests from students against the conservative university board and lack of participation in the university led to the appointment of the first coloured rector, Richard E. van der Ross in 1975. The years thereafter gave way to a more liberal atmosphere, in which the university gradually distanced itself from apartheid. In 1982, the university rejected the apartheid ideology formally in its mission statement; during the next year, the university gained the same autonomy as white universities through the \"University of the Western Cape Act\".\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, numerous UWC students were involved in the creation of Bush Radio, an anti-apartheid media project which distributed political and cultural radio programming via cassette tape due to the lack of a license to broadcast on a conventional radio platform. By 1993, the station went to air as a pirate radio station, and eventually became South Africa's first licensed community radio station.\n\nRector Jakes Gerwel made UWC an \"intellectual home of the left\", with attention to social and political issues. The university attracted increasing numbers of students from disadvantaged communities. Apart from coloured people, more and more black students enrolled. Gerwel was succeeded in 1995 by Cecil Abrahams, who was succeeded by Brian O'Connell in 2001. UWC retained the status of an autonomous university during the education restructuring of 2002.\n\nUWC is the only African institution that is a member of the OpenCourseWare Consortium (OCWC), and was voted onto the OCWC board in 2007.\n\nUWC is a research-rich environment. The academic staff is highly qualified, with 50% holding doctorates. Most departments have graduate programmes, some with the largest intake in the country. There are many institutes and centres with a strong research emphasis. And there are significant projects and programmes which draw on expertise across departments and faculties. There are also joint endeavours between the University of the Western Cape and the universities of Cape Town and Stellenbosch. 20% of all students at UWC are postgraduates.\n\nLike other South African universities, UWC has been affected by sporadic student protests since 2015. The reasons for the protests change with each new period of protest. They began with the Fees Must Fall movement where the main goal was to get university fees to be state-funded and then grew to include issues surrounding student safety and accommodation. These protests often lead to the shutdown of academic activities at the university. Most recently academic activities were suspended from 5 February 2020 to 7 February 2020 due to a delay in financial clearance which left many students unable to register for the new year. \n\nResearch at UWC has an international dimension. UWC's major network of international partners ensures a flow of students and eminent scholars from other countries to enrich the environment. Some major projects are undertaken jointly with partners abroad. Many UWC scholars speak at international conferences and publish in internationally respected journals and books. And there is a strong and growing relationship with institutions in other countries in Africa, Europe and North America, leading to research partnerships, joint capacity building, and a flow of postgraduate students to UWC. In addition, UWC Honours and Master's graduates have won a number of major international scholarships. They have done well in doctoral programmes abroad.\n\nIn 2014, Webometrics ranked the university the 6th best in South Africa, 7th best in Africa and 885th in the world.\n\nThe Children's Rights Project is a South African organisation. Located in the Community Law Centre, University of the Western Cape. Its goal is the recognition and protection of children's rights within the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1810009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810009", "title": "Kadıköy", "text": "Kadıköy\n\nKadıköy (; known in classical antiquity and during the Roman and Byzantine eras as Chalcedon, in ), is a large, populous, and cosmopolitan district in the Asian side of Istanbul, Turkey, on the northern shore of the Sea of Marmara, facing the historic city centre on the European side of the Bosporus. Kadıköy is also the name of the most prominent neighbourhood of the district, a residential and commercial area that, with its numerous bars, cinemas and bookshops, is the cultural centre of the Anatolian side of Istanbul. Kadıköy became a district in 1928 when it was separated from Üsküdar district. The neighbourhoods of İçerenköy, Bostancı and Suadiye were also separated from the district of Kartal in the same year, and eventually joined the newly formed district of Kadıköy. Its neighbouring districts are Üsküdar to the northwest, Ataşehir to the northeast, Maltepe to the southeast, and Kartal beyond Maltepe. The population of Kadıköy district, according to the 2007 census, is 509,282.\n\nKadıköy is an older settlement than most of those on the Anatolian side of the city of İstanbul. Relics dating to 5500-3500 BC (Chalcolithic period) have been found at the Fikirtepe Mound, and articles of stone, bone, ceramic, jewelry and bronze show that there has been a continuous settlement since prehistoric times. A port settlement dating from the Phoenicians has also been discovered. Chalcedon was the first settlement that the Greeks from Megara established on the Bosphorus, in 685 BC, a few years before they established Byzantium on the other side of the strait in 667 BC. Chalcedon became known as the 'city of the blind', the story being that Byzantium was founded following a prophecy that a great capital would be built 'opposite the city of the blind' (meaning that the people of Chalcedon must have been blind not to see the obvious value of the peninsula on the Golden Horn as a natural defensive harbour). The fourth ecumenical church council, Council of Chalcedon, was held there in 451 AD.\n\nChalcedon changed hands time and time again, as Persians, Bithynians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, and Turks passed through the area, which was badly damaged during the Fourth Crusade and came into Ottoman hands in 1353, a full century before Constantinople. Thus, Kadıköy has the oldest mosque in İstanbul, built almost a century before the conquest of Constantinople in 1453.\n\nAt the time of the conquest, Chalcedon was a rural settlement outside the protection of the city. It was soon put under the jurisdiction of the Constantinople courts, hence the name \"Kadıköy\", which means \"Village of the Judge\". In the Ottoman period, Kadıköy became a popular market for agricultural goods and in time developed into a residential area for people who would commute to the city by boat. \n\nAccording to Ottoman estimations of 1882, the district of Kadıköy had a total population of 6,733, consisting of 2,695 Muslims, 1,831 Armenians, 1,822 Greeks, 249 Jews, 92 Latins, 28 Bulgarians and 16 Catholics.\n\nThe major Haydarpaşa Terminal of the Turkish State Railways is located close to Kadıköy's centre and was opened in 1908 as the terminus of the İstanbul-Baghdad and İstanbul-Damascus-Medina railways. The terminal closed due to infrastructure works in 2013 and reopened in 2018, serving east- and south-bound international, domestic and regional trains.\n\nThe Söğütlüçeşme railway station, the next station after Haydarpaşa Terminal, is the terminus of the Metrobus line to European side of İstanbul.\n\nThe M4 line of the Istanbul Metro runs from Kadıköy to Tavşantepe daily between 6:00 and 23:57.\n\nThe centre of Kadıköy today is the transportation hub for people commuting between the Asian side of the city and the European side across the Bosphorus. There is a large bus and minibus terminal next to the ferry quay. Ferries are the most dominantly visible form of transport in Kadıköy, and the central market area is adjacent to the ferry quay.\n\nPublic transportation with terminus in Kadıköy:\n\n For more lines, visit: http://www.iett.istanbul/en/main/hatlar\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional ferries,\n\nSea buses,\n\nThe centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP) is usually successful in Kadıköy in both local and national elections. Since the mid-1990s the mayor has been from the CHP. Former mayor S. Öztürk is often credited with the recent growth in the number of shopping and leisure areas around Kadıköy, especially since the pedestrianisation of \"Bahariye Street\", which many say has become the Kadıköy equivalent of İstiklal Avenue, including its nostalgic trams, on the European side of Istanbul.\n\nMarmara University has most of its buildings in Kadıköy, including the large and elegant Haydarpaşa Campus, while the largest private university in İstanbul, Yeditepe University, is located on the hill named \"Kayışdağı\" at the easternmost edge of the borough (Which later connected to Ataşehir). A new state university, İstanbul Medeniyet University, opened in 2010. It has its main building in Göztepe, Merdivenköy, and has begun to develop campuses in both Kadıköy and Üsküdar. The campuses are divided by the D-100 Highway. Each have a metro station close by.\n\nAnother private institution for higher education, the Doğuş University, is situated in the Acıbadem neighborhood of Kadıköy.\n\nThere are also remarkable high schools such as Atatürk Fen Lisesi, Kadıköy Anadolu Lisesi, Mustafa Saffet Anadolu Lisesi, İstanbul Anadolu Lisesi, İstanbul Kadıköy Lisesi, FMV Özel Erenköy Işık Lisesi, Saint-Joseph Fransız Lisesi and Göztepe İhsan Kurşunoğlu Anadolu Lisesi.\n\nKadıköy is a busy shopping district, with a wide variety of atmospheres and architectural styles. The streets are varied, some being narrow alleyways and others, such as \"Bahariye Caddesi\", being pedestrian zones. Turkey's biggest food market is there, starting next to the Osman Ağa Mosque, and has an immense turnover of fresh foods and other products from all around Turkey, including a wide range of fresh fish and seafood, olive oil soap, and so on. There are also modern shopping centres, most notably the large Tepe Nautilus Shopping Mall behind the center of Kadıköy, and pavements crowded with street vendors selling socks, unlicensed copies of popular novels, and other products. In the streets behind the main post office, there is a large number of well-known bookshops selling both new and second-hand books, craft-shops and picture-framers, and a number of shops selling music CDs and related ephemera such as film posters and T-shirts. Hard Rock and Heavy Metal music is sold in the arcade named \"Akmar Pasajı\", where associated items are also sold. On Sundays this area becomes a large second-hand book and music street market. Being a crowded shopping district, Kadıköy has many buskers, shoe shine boys, glue sniffers and schoolchildren in the streets selling flowers, chewing gum and packets of tissues.\n\nAt the top of the shopping district there is an intersection, with a statue of a bull, called \"Altıyol\" (\"Six Ways\"), where a road leads to the civic buildings and a huge street market called \"Salı Pazarı\" (\"Tuesday Market\"). The working-class residential districts of Hasanpaşa and Fikirtepe are located behind the civic buildings.\n\nThere is a lot of residential property in the centre of Kadıköy, mostly somewhat dilapidated today, but there are still quiet suburban streets. The area is home to many students as well as a small number of foreign residents.\n\nKadıköy has many narrow streets filled with cafés, bars and restaurants, as well as many cinemas. Süreyya Opera House is a recent redevelopment of the same named historic movie theatre.\n\nThe market area is mostly closed to traffic and contains a wide variety of fast food restaurants serving toasted sandwiches, hamburgers and döner. There are also traditional Turkish restaurants and patisseries, bridge schools, wine houses, bars with jazz, folk and rock music, as well as working class tea and backgammon houses.\n\nBehind the coast, lies a large shopping and residential district winding uphill to the \"Bahariye Caddesi\" pedestrian zone. This area was transformed during the economic boom of the 1990s and shops were opened and bars at surrounding.\n\nKadıköy's entertainment is generally not of the affluent type. It has a more working class ambiance; therefore, it is easier to find food of the like of kebab and fried mussels than haute cuisine, although one of İstanbul's most traditional Turkish cuisine representatives, Yanyalı Fehmi Lokantası and the foreign tourist attracting Çiya is found here. Also oldest candy maker Hacı Bekir and chocolate maker Baylan located in Kadıköy.\n\nKadıköy does not have as much nightlife as Beyoğlu (where nightlife also continues much later into the night), nor does it have Nişantaşı's style of shopping or the Bosphorus for nightlife. Instead, it is often considered a modest alternative but may still be regarded as vibrant and cosy. Residents like to frequent the seaside to walk or sit in the grass with a view of the European side of Istanbul across the Bosporus.\n\nİstanbul Toy Museum in Göztepe has on display 4,000 toys and miniatures, from Turkey and abroad; many of the exhibits are antiques, some of which date back nearly 200 years. The first floor of the museum is actually the site of the Eyüp Toy Shop, a famous toy shop that had closed down in the 1950s.\n\nAlong the coast, away from the centre of Kadıköy, there are many expensive shops and the area becomes more upmarket in neighbourhoods such as Moda and Fenerbahçe, which are attractive, long-established residential areas. These both lie within the bounds of the borough of Kadıköy, and have many restaurants, cafés and bars by the sea. There is a path here along the sea-front from Kadıköy; the tram to Moda calls here.\n\nModa is an old, quiet, cosmopolitan İstanbul neighbourhood, but is beginning to experience economic and aesthetic problems, with there being a lack of car parking and some run-down shops and other buildings. As elsewhere in İstanbul, many historic houses have been demolished and replaced with apartment buildings; however, Moda is generally considered one of the more pleasant residential districts in the city. There are numerous churches in Moda with active congregations, and well-known schools, such as the Lycée Saint-Joseph and Kadıköy Anadolu Lisesi. There is a small, attractive theatre in Moda named \"Oyun Atölyesi\", founded by actor Haluk Bilginer. The area is also well-known for its multiple modern cafes, bars, shops and is very popular among Istanbul's creative class and tourists. \n\nAnother smart new district is Acıbadem. This area has one of the best-known private hospitals in the city and a long avenue of smart cafés, restaurants and ice cream parlours.\n\nBeyond this area, the huge stadium of Fenerbahçe Football Club dominates the skyline. From here, the long shopping street named Bağdat Caddesi (Baghdad Avenue) heads east and there are many affluent neighbourhoods between the avenue and the coast. Until the 1950s these areas, such as Kalamış, Göztepe, Caddebostan, Bağdad Avenue, Erenköy, and Suadiye, were full of summer houses and mansions for the city's wealthy upper middle class. Since the Bosphorus Bridge was built, it has become easier to commute from here to the European side of İstanbul, and most of these summer houses have been demolished and replaced with modern apartment buildings; however, these districts many still be considered among the most beautiful residential areas of the city. The coast here has a long stretch of seaside parks and yacht marinas, and the streets behind the coast in areas such as Caddebostan are lined with numerous bars and cafés.\n\nFrom Bostancı onwards the economic level progressively lessens, so there are more retired and working-class residents here. There are no more villas, excepting some on the coast at Dragos, and the apartment buildings are narrower and less widely spaced. Bostancı itself is a busy shopping district built around a railway station.\n\nInland from the coast there is a great deal of housing development: some of this has little infrastructure, while most is more expensive, especially in areas such as Kozyatağı and İçerenköy. These districts house many of İstanbul's upper-middle class residents. These neighbourhoods are mainly built around wide avenues and tree-lined streets, with four to six-storey apartment buildings that have sizable gardens and car-parking around them. Especially in Kozyatağı, there are old Ottoman houses nearly in every houses' garden (Each house or apartment has a big garden with parking lots and arbours while these gardens used to be the old house's). Kozyatağı, Suadiye and Kazasker used to be one of the most popular summer areas for wealthy İstanbul residents. Today, Kozyatağı has tree-lined streets, especially magnolia, linden and fruit trees such as medlar trees, plum trees, cherry, mulberry and quince trees, lots of large greenfields, parks, children parks. These areas, Suadiye, Bağdat Caddesi, Kalamış, Kozyatağı, Fenerbahçe have today, upper-middle or upper class residents. There are many schools, hospitals, shops and restaurants in these areas. There is also a large Carrefour and Bauhaus store on the E5 highway in this part of Kadıköy.\n\nIn the late 1990s, new luxury housing developments such as Ataşehir began to be constructed in the previously undeveloped area north of the E5 highway. These have their own shops, private colleges, sports centres and other facilities. Ataşehir separated from Kadıköy in 2009 elections.\n\nKadıköy has many houses from the Ottoman and some from Roman period which are hidden in its side streets. Some of them have been turned into cafés, pubs and restaurants, particularly serving seafood and rest of them waiting for restoration.\n\nThe district is home to the major Turkish multi-sport club Fenerbahçe SK and their football stadium, the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium. Following important victories, all neighbourhoods of Kadıköy are crowded with celebrating people. The stadium hosted the 2009 UEFA Cup Final. The area also has a rugby union team, Kadıköy Rugby, which was the first official rugby club in Turkey.\n\nThe multi-purpose arena of Caferağa Sport Hall, located in the center of Kadıköy's shopping district, is home to the basketball teams of Alpella (men team) and Fenerbahçe İstanbul (women team), volleyball teams (Fenerbahçe Men's Volleyball and Fenerbahçe Women's Volleyball).\n\nThe district was also home to KadıköySpor, a basketball club that evolved into the current top-level club Anadolu Efes.\n\nKadıköy has been always a place with population belonging to the three main religions, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. There are still many examples of mosques, Greek or Armenian churches and synagogues, As with the rest of İstanbul. The city is the see of the Metropolis of Chalcedon, one of the four remaining metropolises of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in Turkey today.\n\nHemdat Israel Synagogue, situated in Yeldeğirmeni neighbourhood close to Haydarpaşa Terminal, is one of the oldest Jewish houses of prayer in İstanbul.\n\nKadıköy is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

Population is 711,894. It also neighbours Sultanbeyli, Sancaktepe and Çekmeköy from northwest, Şile from north and Gebze from northeast.\n\nThere are records of settlements in Pendik going back to 5,000 years ago, a Greek settlement in 753 BC, and many more conquests. In 1080, the town was taken over by the Seljuk Turks, and recaptured by the Byzantines in 1086 and so on. During the Byzantine era, the place was called Pantikion or Pentikion, and before that Pantikap[a]ion in Greek (as the town had five walls, or five gates, or both). Pendik was always a retreat from the city, and by the 20th century was peppered with holiday and weekend homes of Istanbul's wealthy. It was part of Kartal district till 1987. Tuzla one separated from it in 1992. Pendik had present borders with return boroughs of Güzelyalı and Esenyalı (now divided between Güzelyalı, Orhangazi, Esenyalı, Fatih and Ahmet Yesevi ones) from Tuzla in 1994.\n\nUntil the 1970s Pendik was a rural area, far from the city. Today Pendik is a crowded mix of working class housing (especially further towards the E5 motorway) with more expensive apartments with sea views along the coast. There is a busy shopping district (with a large street market on Saturdays), restaurants and movie theaters.\n\nPendik is far from downtown Istanbul. There used to be suburban trains running from Haydarpasa to Pendik railway station but as part of the Marmaray project this line is currently out of service (it is expected to reopen in 2018). Since 25 July 2014, high-speed services to Ankara start from this station, pending termination of the upgrades on the line to Istanbul proper. In 2016, an extension of the M4 line of the Istanbul Metro was completed. The Pendik metro station is located about north of the railway station.\n\nThe coastal road is fast but does not carry public transport, except for the bus 16A which only runs until 8pm and the Kadikoy-Bostanci-Pendik dolmus. There is road construction going on in the Pendik/Tuzla/Gebze region, which has seen industrial development in the 1990s.\n\nOver the centuries, Bosniaks have migrated to Turkey, with a large number arriving after the Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878. Many settled in the Pendik boroughs of Sapanbağları, Yeşilbağlar and Bahçelievler. Apart from naming their streets and shops after their village in Bosnia, these people have blended into the Istanbul working-class lifestyle of the rest of Pendik.\n\nIn the late 1990s two private educational institutions were built inland from Pendik, Koç Özel Lisesi and Sabancı University. The area has a Formula One racetrack. There is a high-speed boat across the Marmara Sea to Yalova for people travelling out of the city to Bursa and the Aegean.

Most of the housing in Bağcılar was illegally built Gecekondu but has now been replaced by rows of cramped apartment buildings, also built with minimal regulation. It is an example of failed urban planning, perhaps exemplified by the fact that Bağcılar was not created as a district in its own right until 1992, by which time the original inhabitants had all left and building in the area was out of control. \n\nThe local council is now trying to invest in parks, cafes and other amenities but the area is so full that there is little space. \n\nBağcılar also houses a great deal of industry, particularly light engineering, textiles, printing (Bağcılar is home to all the biggest of Turkey's newspapers and TV channels), a huge wholesale market for dry goods, a large second-hand car market, and many trucking companies, particularly along the Gunesli link road from the TEM motorway to Istanbul airport.

The strands are plied in the opposite direction to that of their twist, which adds torsional strength to the cord and keeps it from unravelling. This process is sometimes called reverse wrap. The same technique used for making twine is also used to make thread, which is thinner, yarn, and rope, which is stronger and thicker, generally with three or more strands.\n\nNatural fibres used for making twine include wool, cotton, sisal, jute, hemp, henequen, and coir. A variety of synthetic fibres are also used.\n\nThe invention of twine is at least as important as the development of stone tools for early humans. Indeed, Elizabeth Wayland Barber has called the development of twine, which can be made far stronger and longer than its component fibers, \"the string revolution.\" Twine could be used to fasten points and blades to arrows, spears, harpoons and other tools and to make snares, bags, baby slings, fishing and hunting nets and marine tackle, not to mention to secure firewood, haul goods and anchor tents and shelters. Twine is the foundation to both textile and rope making.Twine has been made of animal hair, including human, sinews and plant material, often from the vascular tissue of a plant (known as bast), but also bark and even seed down, e.g. milkweed. However, unlike stone or metal tools, most twine is missing from the archaeological record because it is made of perishable materials that rarely survive over time. Since often working with fiber is done by women, the disappearance of twine, baskets and textiles means that the importance of women's innovations and labour during the Upper Paleolithic (50,000–10,000 years ago) have been downplayed in the record. In fact, the discovery of ancient beads and the dating of sea travel to at least 60,000 years ago suggests that the \"string revolution\" might have occurred much earlier than the Upper Paleolithic. \n\nPaleolithic cord remnants have been discovered in a few places: Georgia's Dzudzuana Cave (30,000 years old), Israel's Ohalo II site (19,000 years old), and France's Lascaux Cave (17,000 years old). In 2016, a carved piece of mammoth ivory with three holes, dated at 40,000 years old, was unearthed at the Hohle Fels site, famous for the discovery of both Paleolithic female figurines and flutes. It has been identified as a tool for twining rope. In the Americas, cordage has been found at the Windover Bog, in Florida, dating to 8000 years ago. A small piece of cord discovered at Abris du Muras, in south-eastern France, has been dated to around 50,000 years ago. \n\nEarly depictions of twine are few, but one of the around 200 Venus figurines that have been found across Eurasia is depicted as wearing a \"string skirt\" (the Venus of Lespugue, dated to 25,000 years ago). Barber notes that not only is each twist in the strings carved in detail, but also \"the bottom end of each string [is shown] fraying out into a mass of loose fibers (not possible for e.g. a twisted piece of gut or sinew).\" \n\nOther evidence for the prehistoric use of twine is provided by impressions on metal or in pottery and other ceramic artifacts. In the Fukui Cave, Japan, such impressions date to 13,000 years ago. Imprints of woven material in clay found at Dolni Vestonice I and several other sites in Moravia date to 26,000 years ago. and were found along with needles and tools that were used to sew clothing and make nets for hunting small animals and birds. \n\nBeads, as well as shells and animal teeth with man-made holes, have also been used as indirect evidence of twining, as have net sinkers and tools with the marks of cord wear. Beads have been found with the remnants of thread still trapped inside them. \n\nAfter the technique of making twine by hand was invented, various implements to produce thread for textile production such as spindles, spinning wheels and looms for spinning and weaving and tools for twine and rope-making were developed. \n\nThe twining process begins with cordage, which can be any form of untwisted, twisted or braided combination of fibers. A cord is formed by the twisting of at least one ply of material or the braiding together of multiple plies. The number of plies and the type of material lends itself to the naming of the type and structure of the cord. A simple ply is one that is made from a single strand or bunch of material that is spun in the same direction whereas a compound ply is created by twisting several strands or bunches of material individually and then spinning those together in opposite directions to one another.\n\nOnce twine is produced, it can be used to produce other forms of function, most commonly textiles and basketry. The spun twine is then combined using a process called twining in order to produce both types of object. The primary constituents of this twining process are known as the warp and weft or the foundation and stitch. Objects created with this method using varying techniques may also host unique structural decoration. Systematic passing of the warp can create images or patterned modifications. In accompaniment of warp modifications, dyed or naturally coloured materials may be used to accumulate patterns. Textural differences may be created in twined objects by intentional spacing of strands implemented in the weave. Lastly, other auxiliary materials can be incorporated into the object for further detail such as embroidery, feathers, appliques, etc.\n\nThere are several primary means of classifying objects such as threads, textiles and baskets created with twining. The way that the weft rows are spaced can be defined as open, closed or a combination of the two. These terms identify the closeness of the weft rows to one another and variation in this intentional spacing. The way that the warp and weft are interconnected creates different compositional arrangements. These arrangements can be simple, diagonal or both. The last main categorization comes from the direction that the weft is twisted. This is denoted as S-twist and Z-twist or both. In the S-twist the strands appear to come up as they are twisted left and the Z-twist appears to come up as they are twisted to the right.\n\nAdditional classifications that are typically recorded by anthropologists can include the width of the strands, the number of strands being used together to form the warp or weft, the number of warp and weft rows per unit centimeter, and the width of the gaps in the weft rows. Methods of preparation, composition, and creation are also of great importance.\n"}

It is the third song on their debut album, \"Bleach\", released in June 1989. \n\nA live, acoustic version of the song, recorded during Nirvana's \"MTV Unplugged \" appearance in November 1993, was released as a single in October 1994, to promote the full album of the performance, \"MTV Unplugged in New York\". The first single released since Cobain's death in April 1994, it reached number one on \"Billboard's\" Modern Rock Tracks chart and number 22 on \"Billboard's\" Hot 100 Airplay chart.\n\nDating back to 1988, \"About a Girl\" was reportedly written after Cobain spent an afternoon repeatedly listening to \"Meet the Beatles!\", the 1964 second American release by the Beatles. The song was recorded in December 1988 by Jack Endino at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle, Washington, and appeared on Nirvana's debut album, \"Bleach\", in June 1989. It was debuted live at a dorm party at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington in February 1989.\n\nAccording to Cobain, he had been attempting to conceal his pop songwriting at this time, and was reluctant to include the song on \"Bleach\" for fear of alienating the band's then-largely grunge fan base. In a 1993 \"Rolling Stone\" interview with David Fricke, he explained:\n\nHowever, Endino was excited about the song, and even saw it as a potential single. In a 1997 interview with Gillian G. Gaar for \"Goldmine\", he recalled Cobain's initial trepidation about including the song on \"Bleach\".\n\n\"I think Kurt felt nervous about putting 'About a Girl' on there, but he was very insistent on it. He said, 'I've got a song that's totally different from the others, Jack, you've gotta just humour me here, because we're gonna do this real pop tune.' The question was raised at some point, gee, I wonder if Sub Pop's going to like this, and we decided, 'Who cares?' Sub Pop said nothing. In fact, I think they liked it a lot.\"\n\nIn 2004, Butch Vig, who produced Nirvana's 1991 breakthrough album \"Nevermind\", cited \"About a Girl\" as the first hint that there was more to Nirvana than grunge. \"Everyone talks about Kurt's love affair with... the whole punk scene, but he was also a huge Beatles fan, and the more time we spent together the more obvious their influence on his songwriting became,\" Vig told the \"NME\".\n\nOn October 26, 1989, a version was recorded by Ted de Bono at Maida Vale Studios in London, England, during Nirvana's first BBC \"Peel Session\". The full session was first broadcast on November 22, 1989. Another version was recorded on November 1, 1989 at Villa 65 in Hilversum, the Netherlands for the VPRO radio show, \"Nozems-a-Gogo\".\n\nThe studio version of \"About a Girl\" was re-released on the band's first \"best of\" compilation, \"Nirvana\", in October 2002. The \"MTV Unplugged\" version was re-released on a second hits compilation, \"Icon\", in August 2010.\n\n\"About a Girl\" was performed for the final time live at Nirvana's last concert, at Terminal Einz in Munich, Germany on March 1, 1994.\n\n\"About a Girl\" is an alternative rock song that runs for a duration of two minutes and forty-eight seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderately fast rock tempo of 130 beats per minute. \"About a Girl\" is composed in the key of E minor, while Kurt Cobain's vocal range spans one octave and six notes, from the low-note of B to the high-note of A. The song primarily alternates between the open chords of Em and G in the verses and follows a chord progression of C–G–F–C–G–F–E–A–C during the refrain. During the verses, Cobain repeats the same two chords as Kris Novoselic's bass line continuously ascends while a vocal harmony and tambourines appear in the background. The song's chorus features slight key modulation, where chords land just a slightly away from the place expected. \"About a Girl\" has an aching, wistful melody which Cobain sings over simple chord progressions. His electric guitar playing grows rawer and noisier over the course of the track.\n\nAccording to Chad Channing, Nirvana's \"Bleach\"-era drummer, Cobain didn't have a title for the song when he first brought it into the studio. When asked what it was about, Cobain replied, \"It's about a girl.\" \n\nThe \"girl\" was Tracy Marander, Cobain's then-girlfriend, with whom he lived at the time. Apparently, Marander had asked Cobain why he had never written a song for her, and Cobain responded with \"About a Girl.\" The lyrics addresses the couple's fractured relationship, caused by Cobain's refusal to get a job, or to share cleaning duties at their apartment, which housed many of his pets. During arguments on the subject, Cobain would occasionally threaten to move into his car, at which point Marander would usually relent. Cobain never told Marander that he had written \"About a Girl\" for her. In the 1998 Nick Broomfield documentary \"Kurt and Courtney\", Marander revealed that she only found out after reading Michael Azerrad's 1993 Nirvana biography, \"\".\n\n\"About a Girl\" has frequently been cited as early evidence of Cobain's talent as a pop songwriter. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of \"Allmusic\" wrote that the song \"illustrated signs of [Cobain's] considerable songcraft.\" Evan Rytlewskia of \"Pitchfork\" called it \"a glimpse at the melodic impulses that would make [Cobain] one of the defining rock musicians of the ’90s.\" According to Will Bryant of \"Pitchfork\", it was \"curious, based on the clean guitars and tinny cymbals that dominate [\"About a Girl\"], how Nirvana ever came to be identified with grunge, the genuinely dirty and moody sound more readily associated with contemporaries Mudhoney, Soundgarden and Tad than the punk-metal hybrid Nirvana favored.\" The \"NME\" described it as \"Kurt's first true masterpiece,\" which \"showed Nirvana's soft underbelly could be just as arresting as their ear-splitting thrashes.\"\n\nIn 2004, the \"NME\" ranked \"About a Girl\" second on their list of the \"20 Greatest Nirvana Songs Ever.\" The same year, \"Q\" ranked it second on their list of the \"10 Greatest Nirvana Songs Ever.\" In 2015, it was placed at number eight on \"Rolling Stone's\" ranking of 102 Nirvana songs. It was ranked at number 112 on \"Pitchfork's\" 2015 list of \"The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s,\" with Raymond Cummings calling it a \"sharp, perceptive, well-constructed, and almost Beatles-esque\" song \"that demonstrated a potential beyond grunge's ghetto.\" In 2019, it was ranked eighth on \"The Guardian's\" list of \"Nirvana's 20 greatest songs\".\n\n\"About a Girl\" is a BMI award-winning song.\n\nOn April 24, 2020, the song was performed by American musician Post Malone as part of his 15-song Nirvana tribute concert livestreamed on YouTube, which raised more than $4 million for the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.\n\nFeaturing Pat Smear on second guitar, the \"MTV Unplugged\" version was released as a single in October 1994, to promote the album \"MTV Unplugged in New York\", released the following month. It was the only commercial single released from the album, and featured the \"Unplugged\" version of \"Something in the Way\" as the b-side. Cobain opened the song by saying, \"This is off our first record. Most people don't own it.\"\n\nReviewing \"MTV Unplugged in New York\" for the \"NME\", John Harris wrote that the song's \"musical backdrop suggests The Beatles in 1964, at their lovelorn best: minor-key introspection gives way to regular traces of lightened-up calm, only to regain the upper hand within bars. ... For that reason, encapsulated in the fact that it rides on a divinely simple verse/ chorus/ verse undertow, it may be the most beautiful song here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1810033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810033", "title": "Eminönü", "text": "Eminönü\n\nEminönü is a former district of Istanbul in Turkey, currently a quarter within the Fatih district, which is the capital district of Istanbul and of Istanbul Province. This is the heart of the walled city of Constantine, the focus of a history of incredible richness. Eminönü covers roughly the area on which the ancient city of Byzantium was built. The Galata Bridge crosses the Golden Horn and connects Karaköy (historic Galata) at north with Eminönü at south. Eminönü is located at the point where the Golden Horn connects with the southern entrance of the Bosphorus strait, near the Sea of Marmara. Up on the hill stands Topkapı Palace, the Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet Camii) and Hagia Sophia (Aya Sofya). It was a part of the Fatih district until 1928, which covered the whole peninsular area (the old Stamboul) within the Roman city walls - that area which was formerly the Byzantine capital Constantinople. Since the resident population of Eminönü is low today, it rejoined the capital district Fatih in 2009.\n\nThe Golden Horn was a natural port, particularly the Eminönü/Sirkeci shore, which being on a peninsula was also eminently defensible. It was this location that led to the foundation of Byzantium, and from here that the city grew, with the oldest neighborhoods being the port districts along the Golden Horn. In the 12th century, the Byzantine port was also occupied by merchants from Venice, Amalfi, Genoa and Pisa, who eventually acquired their own wharfs and waterfront districts.\n\nIn the Byzantine period, the modern area of Eminönü included the districts of \"Neórion\" (after the harbor located there), \"Akrópolis\", \"Kynégion\", \"Arcadianae/Arkadianaí\", \"ta Hormísdou\", \"Amantíou\", \"Caenopolis/Kainópolis\" (\"New City\"), \"ta Kanikleíou\", \"ta Narsoú\", \"ta Kaisaríou\", \"Artopoleía\" (the \"bakeries\"), \"Argyroprateía\" (the \"silver vendors\"), \"Chalkoprateía\" (the \"bronze vendors\"), \"ta Olybríou\", \"Constantinianae/Konstantinianaí\", \"ta Amastrianón\", \"Eugeníou\", \"Pérama\" (\"Crossing\", the place where the ferry to Galata sailed), \"Zeúgma\", \"Stauríon\", \"Vlánga\", \"Heptáskalon\".\n\nThe Golden Horn was still a thriving port in Ottoman times, occupied by importers, warehousemen, sailors and traders of every description, the centre of trade in the city, a labyrinth of narrow streets, workshops and markets leading uphill to Topkapı Palace, the Ottoman capital.\n\nThe name of the quarter, Eminönü, reflects its place in history. Translated from Turkish to English it roughly means 'in front of justice'. Emin meaning 'justice', önü meaning 'in front of'. The name most probably came from the Ottoman courts and customs houses on the docks; \"Emin\" was the title of an Ottoman customs official.\n\nThe nature of the place was changed by the industrial age; the Galata Bridge was built across the Golden Horn; steamships arrived, then electricity, then the railway and the Istanbul terminal of the Orient Express was naturally sited at Sirkeci Station. The sea walls still surrounded the city, and the sea gates of the port of Eminönü were the point of entry for goods, and for people. Eminönü was part of the Fatih district until 1928. It then became independent until 2009, when it was incorporated again within Fatih.\n\nIn the wake of the huge railway station, other grand stone buildings were also built in the late Ottoman period. Among these were the Main Post Office and some commercial buildings like Istanbul 4th Vakıf Han. In the early days of the Republic of Turkey, Eminönü was renovated extensively; the big square was opened up in front of Yeni Mosque by clearing out the tollbooths at the end of the Galata Bridge; the Spice bazaar was restored; the fish market was cleared off the shore of the Golden Horn and a road opened up to the new bridge at Unkapanı.\n\nBy the 1950s, the area was continuously clogged up with traffic, which was eased somewhat by the construction of the large coastal road around the point and all the way out to Istanbul airport.\n\nAlthough the government has moved to Ankara and Istanbul has expanded to become an enormous city with the centre of business in huge shiny buildings elsewhere, Eminönü is still buzzing with activity. It has the busiest ferry crossings for the Bosphorus and for the Marmara Sea, the only car ferry across the Bosphorus and the only mainline railway terminus (where trains can be caught to Eastern Thrace (Trakya) and Europe). People keep streaming into the area on boats, buses, trains and the light metro from Aksaray.\n\nDuring the daytime the area is packed with merchants and their customers, hordes of shoppers and many tourists. Add to this a number of key government buildings including the governor's office and the main campus of Istanbul University in Beyazıt.\n\nAt night it is a quiet place. There is some housing in Eminönü but most of the buildings are offices, shops and workshops, and if one does happen to be there in the evening the contrast with the daytime is eerie and somewhat menacing. Every day roughly two million people work in or pass through Eminönü, but the district has only 30,000 residents. The people that do live in Eminönü are mainly working class and conservative.\n\nEminönü has many historical mosques and buildings, many of Istanbul's best-known landmarks. Recent development has improved Eminönü greatly and many of its winding streets which can at first seem imposing, have been developed and improved, while Eminönü has started to repair the many mosques.\n\n\nThe area is heaving with shoppers; especially at weekends people come from all over the city, looking for discount clothing or plastic accessories, stationery and cheap toys in the streets behind the Spice Bazaar. You will not find the classy boutiques of the big shopping centres here. The clientele in Eminönü is traditional and working class. The narrow climbing street called Mahmutpaşa for example is the place where those of a conservative nature come to buy a coat or a headscarf, or to kit their boys out in the costume they wear on circumcision day.\n\nEminönü is crawling with thousands of people hawking goods on handcarts, makeshift stalls or a blanket laid out in the street, as well as the millions of little shops and workshops in the streets, bazaars and the big stone fortresses from the Ottoman era called Han in Turkish. Every inch is retail space, even the underpasses taking people from the ferries are lined with shops, kebab grillers and boys selling cigarettes. Predictably there is a fair amount of purse-snatching and pickpocketing in the crowds. And the narrow streets are hard to keep clean.\n\nThere are so many businesses packed into such a small area that a single street or even a single building can be the centre of a particular trade, and turning a corner will take you into a totally different atmosphere. Here you are surrounded by stall after stall of denim jeans, and across one block you are submerged in the scent of coffee and spices. The variety is breathtaking and Eminönü takes some exploring.\n\nSome well known sub-districts (semt) include:\n\nIn the daytime there is a wide range of different foods, and in particular the area is covered with 'lokanta' serving soups, stews and hot vegetable dishes at lunchtime. You will find these in all the bazaars and shopping streets, for example the street called Hocapaşa near Sirkeci station has a great variety. Eminönü offers any number of fast foods and snacks including döner, lahmacun and the grilled mackerel sandwiches on the waterfront by the ferry docks. These used to be sold from boats, this is now banned but you can still find mackerel grillers in the area. \n\nMuch of the quarter is closed down in the evening although you will still find food in the following places:\n\nThe following movies have scenes taking place in Eminönü:\n\n"}

Riley gave up the radio show in the mid-1960s and moved to Los Angeles, where his friend Tim Conway helped him obtain work writing comedy sketches, which later led to acting opportunities.\n\nFirst a semi-regular in the cast of the 1960s sitcom \"Occasional Wife\", a short-lived show on NBC in which he played Wally Frick, Riley was perhaps most famous for playing Elliot Carlin, the neurotic, sour and selfish patient on \"The Bob Newhart Show\". In 1973, he was cast as Gomez Addams in \"The Addams Family Fun-House\", then in 1979, he starred in ABC's holiday telefilm \"The Halloween That Almost Wasn't\" (a.k.a. \"The Night Dracula Saved The World\") as Warren the Werewolf (Wolf Man) of Budapest. Riley then, in 1980, appeared in a comedy special for HBO called \"The Wild Wacky Wonderful World of Winter\". He was a regular cast member in \"The Tim Conway Show\", a comedy-variety show that aired on CBS from March 1980 through late summer 1981, acting in sketch comedy in each episode.

{"id": "1810040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810040", "title": "Josephus problem", "text": "Josephus problem\n\nIn computer science and mathematics, the Josephus problem (or Josephus permutation) is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game.\n\nPeople are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a specified point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specified direction. After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is executed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person, going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people, until only one person remains, and is freed.\n\nThe problem — given the number of people, starting point, direction, and number to be skipped — is to choose the position in the initial circle to avoid execution.\n\nThe problem is named after Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian living in the 1st century. According to Josephus' account of the siege of Yodfat, he and his 40 soldiers were trapped in a cave by Roman soldiers. They chose suicide over capture, and settled on a serial method of committing suicide by drawing lots. Josephus states that by luck or possibly by the hand of God, he and another man remained until the end and surrendered to the Romans rather than killing themselves. This is the story given in Book 3, Chapter 8, part 7 of Josephus' \"The Jewish War\" (writing of himself in the third person):\n\nThe details of the mechanism used in this feat are rather vague. According to James Dowdy and Michael Mays, in 1612 Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac suggested the specific mechanism of arranging the men in a circle and counting by threes to determine the order of elimination. This story has been often repeated and the specific details vary considerably from source to source. For instance, Israel Nathan Herstein and Irving Kaplansky (1974) have Josephus and 39 comrades stand in a circle with every seventh man eliminated. A history of the problem can be found in S. L. Zabell's \"Letter to the editor\" of the \"Fibonacci Quarterly\".\n\nJosephus had an accomplice; the problem was then to find the places of the two last remaining survivors (whose conspiracy would ensure their survival). It is alleged that he placed himself and the other man in the 31st and 16th place respectively.\n\nA medieval version of the Josephus problem involves 15 Turks and 15 Christians aboard a ship in a storm which will sink unless half the passengers are thrown overboard. All 30 stand in a circle and every ninth person is to be tossed into the sea. Where should the Christians stand to ensure that only the Turks are tossed? In other versions the roles of Turks and Christians are interchanged.\n\nIn \"Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science\", Graham, Knuth and Patashnik describe and study a \"standard\" variant: Determine where the last survivor stands if there are people to start and every second person ( = 2 below) is eliminated.\n\nA generalization of this problem is as follows. We suppose that every th person will be executed from a group of size , in which the th person is the survivor. If there is an addition of people to the circle, then the survivor is in the -th position if this is less than or equal to . If is the smallest value for which , then the survivor is in position .\n\nIn the following, formula_1 denotes the number of people in the initial circle, and formula_2 denotes the count for each step, that is, formula_3 people are skipped and the formula_2-th is executed. The people in the circle are numbered from formula_5 to formula_1.\n\nWe explicitly solve the problem when every second person will be killed, i.e. formula_7. (For the more general case formula_8, we outline a solution below.)\nWe express the solution recursively. Let formula_9 denote the position of the survivor when there are initially formula_1 people (and formula_7).\nThe first time around the circle, all of the even-numbered people die.\nThe second time around the circle, the new 2nd person dies, then the new 4th person, etc.; it's as though there were no first time around the circle.\n\nIf the initial number of people was even, then the person in position formula_12 during the second time around the circle was originally in position formula_13 (for every choice of formula_12). Let formula_15. The person at formula_16 who will now survive was originally in position formula_17. This gives us the recurrence\n\nIf the initial number of people was odd, then we think of person 1 as dying at the end of the first time around the circle. Again, during the second time around the circle, the new 2nd person dies, then the new 4th person, etc.\nIn this case, the person in position formula_12 was originally in position formula_20. This gives us the recurrence\n\nWhen we tabulate the values of formula_1 and formula_9 we see a pattern:\n\nThis suggests that formula_9 is an increasing odd sequence that restarts with formula_25 whenever the index \"n\" is a power of 2.\nTherefore, if we choose \"m\" and \"l\" so that formula_26 and formula_27, then formula_28.\nIt is clear that values in the table satisfy this equation. Or we can think that after formula_29 people are dead there are only formula_30 people and we go to the formula_31th person. He must be the survivor. So formula_32. Below, we give a proof by induction.\n\nTheorem: If formula_26 and formula_27, then formula_35.\n\nProof: We use strong induction on formula_1. The base case formula_37 is true.\nWe consider separately the cases when formula_1 is even and when formula_1 is odd.\n\nIf formula_1 is even, then choose formula_41 and formula_42 such that formula_43 and formula_44. Note that formula_45.\nWe have formula_46, where the second equality follows from the induction hypothesis.\n\nIf formula_1 is odd, then choose formula_41 and formula_42 such that formula_50 and formula_44. Note that formula_52.\nWe have formula_53, where the second equality follows from the induction hypothesis. This completes the proof.\n\nWe can solve for formula_29 to get an explicit expression for formula_9:\n\nThe most elegant form of the answer involves the binary representation of size formula_1: formula_9 can be obtained by a one-bit left cyclic shift of formula_1 itself. If we represent formula_1 in binary as formula_61, then the solution is given by formula_62. The proof of this follows from the representation of formula_1 as formula_64 or from the above expression for formula_9.\n\nImplementation: If n denotes the number of people, the safe position is given by the function formula_35 ,where formula_26 and formula_27.\n\nNow if we represent the number in binary format, the first bit denotes formula_30 and remaining bits will denote formula_29. For example, when n=41, its binary representation is\n\nn = 1 0 1 0 0 1\n\n2 = 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nl = 0 1 0 0 1\n\nThe easiest way to find the safe position is by using bitwise operators. In this approach, shifting the most-significant set bit of n to the least significant bit will return the safe position. Input must be a positive integer.\n\nn = 1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nn = 0 1 0 0 1 1\n\nIn 1997, Lorenz Halbeisen and Norbert Hungerbühler discovered a closed-form for the case formula_71. They showed that there is a certain constant\n\nthat can be computed to arbitrary precision. Given this constant, choose formula_73 to be the greatest integer such that formula_74 (this will be either formula_75 or formula_76). Then, then the final survivor is\n\nfor all formula_79.\n\nAs an example computation, Halbeisen and Hungerbühler give formula_80 (which is actually the original formulation of Josephus' problem). They compute:\n\nWe can verify this looking at each successive pass on the numbers formula_5 through formula_87:\n\nDynamic programming is used to solve this problem in the general case by performing the first step and then using the solution of the remaining problem. When the index starts from one, then the person at formula_96 shifts from the first person is in position formula_97, where n is the total number of persons. Let formula_98 denote the position of the survivor. After the formula_2-th person is killed, we're left with a circle of formula_100, and we start the next count with the person whose number in the original problem was formula_101. The position of the survivor in the remaining circle would be formula_102 if we start counting at formula_5; shifting this to account for the fact that we're starting at formula_101 yields the recurrence\n\nwhich takes the simpler form\n\nif we number the positions from formula_107 to formula_100 instead.\n\nThis approach has running time formula_109, but for small formula_2 and large formula_1 there is another approach. The second approach also uses dynamic programming but has running time formula_112. It is based on considering killing \"k\"-th, 2\"k\"-th, ..., formula_113-th people as one step, then changing the numbering.\n\nThis improved approach takes the form\n\n\n"}

Acting as a major gateway for US–Asian trade, the port occupies of land with of waterfront in the city of Long Beach, California. The Port of Long Beach is located less than two miles (3 km) southwest of downtown Long Beach and approximately south of downtown Los Angeles. The seaport generates approximately US$100 billion in trade and employs more than 316,000 people in Southern California.\n\nThe San Pedro Breakwater was started in 1899 and over time was expanded to protect the current site of the Port of Long Beach. The Port of Long Beach was founded on of mudflats on June 24, 1911, at the mouth of the Los Angeles River. In 1917, the first Board of Harbor Commissioners was formed to supervise harbor operations. Due to the booming economy, Long Beach voters approved a $5 million bond to improve the inner and outer harbor in 1924.\n\nThe old Municipal Pier was rebuilt into the Municipal Wharf in 1925. In 1925 construction started on Pier A and Pier B, with opening of Pier A in 1930.\n\nBy 1926 more than one million tons of cargo were handled, and additional piers were constructed to accommodate the growing business.\n\nIn 1921, oil was discovered at the Long Beach Oil Field on and around Signal Hill. In 1932, the fourth-largest oil field in the United States, Wilmington Oil Field, was discovered; much of this field was underneath Long Beach and the harbor area itself. The hundreds of oil wells from Wilmington Oil Field provided oil revenues to the City and Port of Long Beach. The first offshore oil well in the harbor was brought online in 1937, shortly after the discovery that the oil field far extended into the harbor. In the mid-1930s, the port was expanded, largely due to the need to transport oil to foreign markets, as the immense output of oil from the Los Angeles Basin caused a glut in US markets.\n\nThe extraction of hundreds of millions of barrels of oil caused concern for subsidence, as the overlying land collapsed into the empty space over time. Engineers and geologists were promptly assigned to the problem, building dikes for flood control at high tide.\n\nOn July 3, 1930 the Federal River and Harbor Act authorizes expanding the San Pedro Bay breakwater by 3.5-mile completed in 1949.\n\nLong Beach became a home port for the United States Navy's Pacific Fleet in 1932. In 1940 the navy purchased 105 acres on Terminal Island built the Long Beach Naval Shipyard there.\n\nIn 1946, after World War II, the Port of Long Beach was established as \"America’s most modern port\" with the completion of the first of nine clear-span transit sheds. Pier E was completed and Pier B was expanded to two times its size in 1949. Pierpoint Landing completed on Pier F in 1948, becoming a large sport fishing spot.\n\nConcerns regarding subsidence increased until Operation \"Big Squirt,\" a water injection program, halted any progression of sinking land in 1960.\n\nIn 1971 Pier J expansion is complete with a 55-acre container and car import terminal, becoming Toyota's Western distribution center. In 1972 International Transportation Service completes a 52-acre container terminal on Pier J with a 1,200-foot wharf and two gantry cranes. Maersk Line Pacific completes on Pier G a 29-acre container terminal. Port of Long Beach is the largest container terminal in America.\n\nWith the rapid expansion of the port pollution also increased. The Port of Long Beach instituted programs to prevent and control oil spills, contain debris, and manage vessel traffic. Due to its efforts, the port was awarded the American Association of Port Authorities Environmental \"E\" Award. Long Beach is the first harbor in the Western Hemisphere to receive such an award.\n\nIn 1980, with improved relations between the United States and China, the port sent officials to the People’s Republic of China for the first time. Less than a year later, the China Ocean Shipping Co. inaugurated international shipping and designated Long Beach as its first US port of call. Relationships were forged with other international powers, and South Korea's Hanjin Shipping opened a container terminal on Pier C of the port in 1991. Following this, COSCO, a Chinese international shipping carrier, secured business with the Port of Long Beach in 1997.\n\nFrom the late 1990s through 2011, the Port of Long Beach saw increased traffic and growth with the leasing of terminals. In 1997, approximately one million containers were inbound to the port. By 2005, this number had tripled to nearly 3.3 million containers. If outbound containers are included, then the number increased from 3 million containers in 1997 to nearly 6.7 million containers in 2005.\n\nIn 2001 U.S. Navy closed its footprint at Port of Long Beach, the Navy transfers it last lot of land on Terminal Island to the Port of Long Beach. The shipyard was closed in 1997.\n\nThe surge in vessel traffic and cargo prompted increased environmental efforts by the port. In 2004, the Port of Long Beach reached compliance with an air pollution mandate by handling petroleum coke, one of the port's largest exports, in improved ways. By using enclosed conveyors and covered storage areas, the port reduced the amount of dust emitted by the petroleum coke by 5%, down 21% in 1997.\n\nIn 2007, the seaport launched banned older diesel trucks from serving the port. On October 1, 2011, the Clean Trucks Program was launched by the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. The program set a goal to reduce air pollution from its truck fleet by 80% by 2012. Trucks built prior to 1987 that fail to meet the 2007 clean truck standards set forth by the United States Environmental Protection Agency are denied access to port terminals. In compliance with the clean truck initiative on October 1, all trucking companies conducting business with the port must have a port-approved concession outlining the regulations they must abide by. By September 23, 2011, nearly 500 trucking companies had applied for concessions, amounting to more than 6,000 trucks.\nIn 2012 International Longshore and Warehouse Union went on strike, that closed down the ports of and Long Beach and Los Angeles. The eight-day strike cost California about $8 billion. Ships were backed up into the pacific ocean. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service helped end the strike. The strike impacted retailers getting ready for the holiday sales.\n\nIn April 2019, Orient Overseas (International) Ltd. announced that it would sell the Long Beach Container Terminal business to a consortium led by Macquarie Infrastructure Partners for $1.78 billion. The federal government demanded the sale of the terminal after a 2018 review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\n\nA decision in 2020 by the California Public Utilities Commission allowed building a fuel cell plant at the port to move ahead. The joint venture by Toyota and FuelCell Energy would produce power and hydrogen from natural gas.\n\nThe port's combined import and export value is nearly $100 billion per year. The seaport provides jobs, generates tax revenue, and supports retail and manufacturing businesses. More than $800 million a year is spent on wholesale distribution services in the city. In the City of Los Angeles, port operations generate more than 230,000 jobs, with more than $10 billion a year going to distribution services in the city. On the state level, the Port of Long Beach provides about 370,000 jobs and generates close to $5.6 billion a year in state and local tax revenues\n\nThe twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are, together, the single largest source of air pollution in the metropolitan Los Angeles area. Both ports have implemented a number of environmental programs to reduce pollution levels while continuing port growth.\n\nThe internationally recognized Green Port Policy was adopted by the Port of Long Beach in 2005 in an effort to reduce pollution in the growing region of Los Angeles/Long Beach. The policy sets a framework for enhancing wildlife habitat, improving air and water quality, cleaning soil and undersea sediments, and creating a sustainable port culture. The guiding principles of the Green Port Policy are to protect the community from the harmful environmental impacts of port operations, distinguish the port as a leader in environmental stewardship and compliance, promote sustainability, employ the best available technology to avoid or reduce environmental impacts, and engage and educate the community. Long Beach Harbor is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy.\n\nIn 2007, the Port of Long Beach continued its environmental efforts by implementing the Clean Air Action Plan, an air quality program adopted by the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. In recognition, the Clean Air Action Plan was given the most prestigious award from the American Association of Port Authorities, the Environmental Management Award, in 2007.\n\nThe Clean Air Action Plan also included the use of trucks that were deemed excessively pollutant. The port's Harbor Commission approved a Clean Trucks Program that banned old diesel trucks by October 2008. The program, outlined in the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, was expected to modernize the port trucking industry and slash truck-related air pollution by 80% by 2012. Diesel-powered harbor short-haul (drayage) trucks are a major source of air pollution.\n\nThe Community Grants Program was created in 2016 to award grants to projects that improve air quality and energy efficiency at facilities used by the public. Established by the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners, it is the largest voluntary effort of its kind in the nation.\n\nWhile clean trucks were a focus, the Port of Long Beach also turned its attention to ships. The Green Flag incentive program was set up to encourage ships to slow down in order to improve air quality. The Green Flag program provides approximately $2 million a year in discounts for vessel operators who slow their ships to 12 knots (22 km/h) or less within of the harbor. According to the port, the Green Flag program reduced air pollution by 600 tons in 2007 and was expected to do better in 2008.\n\nThe port has donated millions of dollars to select Southern California wetlands projects, including a $50 million donation to the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve in Huntington Beach.\nPort of Long Beach officials looking into helping restore and revitalize the Los Cerritos Wetlands.\n\nThe Port of Long Beach is governed by the City of Long Beach. The City Charter created the Long Beach Harbor Department to promote and develop the port. Under the charter, the five-member Board of Harbor Commissioners is responsible for setting policy for the port and managing the Harbor Department.\n\nThe Harbor Commissioners set policies for the Port of Long Beach. Commissioners are appointed by the Mayor of Long Beach and are confirmed by the City Council. They may serve no more than two six-year terms. In July, the commissioners rotate the offices of president and vice president. These offices are held for one year.\n\nTo help improve relations with the Long Beach and surrounding towns, Port of Long Beach started a number of outreach events.\n\n\nIn February 2009, the Port opened a $21 million command center. The Command and Control Center conforms to the port's Green Port Policy of being energy efficient.\nThe Long Beach Harbor Patrol is a group of trained and armed public officers dedicated to security and public safety at the Port of Long Beach. Harbor Patrol officers monitor port facilities and public roads, respond to dispatches, and have authority to access all marine terminals and cargo at the port.\n\nIn addition, Harbor Patrol operates round-the-clock camera surveillance, mobile underwater sonar, dive team, explosive detectors, and other technology to protect port facilities and operations.\n\n\n\n"}

Narutaki-Sou is an old Japanese style one-story house which doesn't fit in urban scenery. The complex is owned by his mother's cousin and the manager of the apartment is his second cousin, Aoba Kozue. They met each other when they were children, although Shiratori doesn't remember much of it. Kozue is in the second grade of a high school attached to Aoba Junior College.\n\nThere are seven residents of Narutaki-Sou. The first, Chanohata Tamami, lives in room #1 and she is Kozue's childhood friend and best friend. Shiratori Ryushi, the main character of the series, resides in room #2. In room #3 resides Momono Megumi, a person who goes her own way in life. Kurosaki Sayoko and her daughter Asami, who is in the first grade of middle school, live in room #5. Finally, in room #6, Haibara Yukio lives with his puppet Johnny.\n\nNarutaki-Sou is filled with characteristic and eccentric people. However, the most eccentric person is Kozue herself. She has a secret of which even she does not know; when she is shocked at something, her personality changes. Not knowing this, Ryushi moves to Narutaki-Sou to realize his dream.\n\nNote: All characters are voiced by Satomi Arai.\nLandlady of Narutaki Sou and Ryūshi's 16-year-old second cousin. She attends the same high school as Tamami. She has several different personalities that come out when she experiences different emotions, but returns to her original one after sleeping or passing out. In the manga, she begins going out with Ryūshi in chapter 39. Near the end of the manga, it is revealed that the cause of her different personalities is her sad past where she lost everyone that she loved, starting with the death of her great grandfather and her later abandonment by her parents. It is further revealed that her other personalities were influenced by the 10-year-old Ryūshi who showed her his drawings and taught her that people can be anything in their imagination.\n\nIn the epilogue, it is shown that she and Ryūshi are married and have four kids, each of them similar to one of her four alternate personalities.\nSaki has a tough attitude and is very strong physically. Despite this, she actually does care about others, even if she is embarrassed to admit it. She appears when Kozue is surprised or angered. She is an extreme lightweight, and unable to tolerate anything but \"umeshu\" (in the manga), in the anime she can't even smell liquor without passing out.\nNanako is usually better behaved after she becomes \"Shiny\". One other noteworthy feature of Nanako is that of all the other personalities that Kozue goes through, Nanako is the only one given an actual age. According to the manga, Saki, Chiyuri, and Natsume all are of unknown age, though it is safe to assume that all of the others have the same age as Kozue.\nChiyuri loves cosplay and also makes everyone else cosplay against their will, but only if it is against their will. If they don't care or want to do so, she doesn't want to. She appears when Kozue is clumsy or frightened. While she is in this personality, Tamami acts as her assistant, whom Chiyuri refers to as \"my partner\", while supplying Tamami many embarrassing photo-ops with which to fill her camera. Tamami, in return, calls Chiyuri \"my sweetheart\". \"Correct!\" is her catchphrase.\nNatsume has a very shy personality who initially avoided speaking to anyone at all. She is extremely skilled at sleight of hand and card tricks. The first time she talked was when teaching Ryushi a trick. Flowers will spontaneously pop out of the top of her head when she's happy. She has a habit of ending her sentences with \"kamo\", meaning either \"maybe\" or \"I think\" depending on the context.\n\nTamami is close friends and classmates with Aoba Kozue. She always has a camera and likes to take pictures of Kozue in embarrassing situations. She is also an inactive member (\"Ghost member\") of the occult club, along with Kozue. Tamami is very strong physically, although she appears quite normal, if not short and weak. A perpetually smiling evil genius, Tamami is cold, sarcastic, cruel, manipulative, inconsiderate and condescending towards those she deem to be her moral/intellectual inferiors; which in other words mean everybody besides Kozue-Chan and her other personalities. This is explained by her usually being isolated for her extreme genius before meeting Kozue. Tamami goes to Seika Tandai Fuzoku High School with Kozue, and has a habit of saying \"desu\" at the end of her sentences. In the manga, it is revealed that she is actually a very emotional person, crying all the while during Momono's departure. At the end of the manga, she becomes a world-class photographer who frequently travels oversea.\nThe main protagonist of the series, who is an aspiring children's book artist. Ryūshi moved into Narutaki Sou so he could attend the Sumeragi Design School in Tokyo. Aoba Kozue is his second cousin. He met Kozue when they were younger, but doesn't remember this at the start of the series. He is childish and passive to the point of never objecting when anyone does anything wrong to him, which happens a lot. In the epilogue, he is shown to have married Aoba Kozue, with four daughters, possibly representing Aoba's former personalities.\nMegumi attended Washida University for one year, but it turned out to be too expensive, so she took a year off. Her hairstyle features an ahoge. She stays at Narutaki Sou all the time and is in a long distance relationship with her middle school boyfriend who is studying cinema overseas. She's also a heavy drinker, and likes to party with Johnny in Shiratori's room, much to his dismay. In the epilogue, she is shown with one daughter, Ruri, who is a fan of Ryūshi's children's books. In the anime, she remains at Sou Narutaki, telling her boyfriend to ask her to join him again once he has finished his studies and fulfilled his dreams.\nSayoko has a very dark personality and is not very responsible. Her father is a rich and talented sculptor, with whom she became estranged in her youth over her choice of her husband; rather than let her parents choose a fiancé for her, she eloped with the estate's gardener. Her favorite food is Mizuyōkan. Despite her evident uselessness throughout the series, she really cares for Asami.\n\nIt should also be noted that despite her poor skills in living, she possesses great skill in chess (which Momono notes is a useless skill in life) and in the arts (capable of making art pieces out of almost anything—sand, snow, wood, and even food), giving evidence that she seems to have inherited her father's skills. At the end of the manga, she is working as a freelance sculptor, making an expensive looking wooden dragon. It is also revealed that she isn't really lazy or bad at working but rather, simply has low or no confidence and motivation.\nAsami lives in room 5 with only her adopted mother since her adopted father died when she was younger. She keeps things together in spite of her mother's problems, pulling most of the workload at home and keeping track of expenses.\n\nYukio doesn't speak directly, but rather uses ventriloquism to speak through his puppet, Johnny. In the anime, he is at one point mistaken for Aleister Crowley by Vermilion, to his and Johnny's considerable distress. Yukio Haibara became Kozue's caretaker after her parents abandoned her at Narutaki Sou. In the manga, Haibara speaks using his own voice only once when he expresses his hope that Shiratori can heal Kozue.\nYukio Haibara's hand puppet of a brown dog through whom Yukio speaks using ventriloquism. They both act as if the puppet were really the one speaking; Johnny often \"speaks\" as if Haibara is the extra part. It is revealed near the end of the manga that Johnny was \"born\" when Haibara was at a loss as to how to get the sad and lonely Kozue to talk to him after her parents left her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren's storybook sidestory\n\nRyushi Shiratori's children's story that is seen many times throughout the anime involves the story of a prince. The prince, who is a representation of Ryushi himself, discovers a castle with a princess living in it. The princess has a fondness for umeboshi and for various reasons concerning umeboshi, she multiplies into other princesses. These new princesses are the representations of Kozue, Saki, Chiyuri, Nanako and Natsume and the princesses appear in the same episode as each of the new personalities are introduced.\n\nComic panel sidestory\n\nOften during the anime a vertical comic-style sketch related to the main story is shown. The art style and music are consistently used in this way as various situations are shown for comedic purposes. Each panel is displayed for several seconds until the next panel scrolls into view. Usually there are four per situation, reflecting the same yonkoma device that is used in the manga.\n\n\nOpening\n\n\nEnding\n\n\nTogether with King Records (Starchild label).\n\nA set of 22 tarot cards with Mahoraba's characters exist. The drawings are done by the author, and in addition to original cards, others such as mass-production versions (simplified background), fake tarot cards (different pictures for card number), and special editions (holographic) exist. These are supplements for related merchandises, and cannot be collected in its entirety solely by buying the books; thus, it is hard to complete the collection.\n"}

{"id": "1810063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810063", "title": "Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons", "text": "Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons\n\nSeveral different editions of the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (\"D&D\") fantasy role-playing game have been produced since 1974. The current publisher of \"D&D\", Wizards of the Coast, produces new materials only for the most current edition of the game. Many \"D&D\" fans, however, continue to play older versions of the game and some third-party companies continue to publish materials compatible with these older editions.\n\nAfter the original edition of \"D&D\" was introduced in 1974, the game was split into two branches in 1977: the rules-light system of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and the more complex, rules-heavy system of \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" (\"AD&D\"). The standard game was eventually expanded into a series of five box sets by the mid-1980s before being compiled and slightly revised in 1991 as the \"Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia\". Meanwhile, the 2nd edition of \"AD&D\" was published in 1989. In 2000 the two branch split was ended when a new version was designated the 3rd edition, but dropped the \"Advanced\" prefix to be called simply \"Dungeons & Dragons\". The 4th edition was published in 2008. The 5th edition was released in 2014.\n\nThe original \"D&D\" was published as a box set in 1974 and featured only a handful of the elements for which the game is known today: just three character classes (fighting-man, magic-user, and cleric); four races (human, dwarf, elf, and hobbit); only a few monsters; only three alignments (lawful, neutral, and chaotic). With a production budget of only $2000 to print a thousand copies, the result was decidedly amateurish. \n\nOnly $100 was budgeted for artwork, and Gygax pressed into service just about anyone who could hold a pencil, including local artist Cookie Corey; Greg Bell, a member of Jeff Perren's gaming group; \"D&D\" co-creator Dave Arneson; Gygax's wife's half-sister Keenan Powell; and fellow TSR co-founder Don Kaye. Each artist was paid $2 for a small piece or $3 for a larger piece, with an identical amount paid as a royalty every time another thousand copies were printed. \n\nThe rules assumed that players owned and played the miniatures wargame \"Chainmail\" and used its measurement and combat systems. An optional combat system was included within the rules that later developed into the sole combat system of later versions of the game. In addition, the rules presumed ownership of \"Outdoor Survival\", a board game by then-unaffiliated company Avalon Hill for outdoor exploration and adventure. \"D&D\" was a radically new gaming concept at the time, and it was difficult for players without prior tabletop wargaming experience to grasp the vague rules. The release of the \"Greyhawk\" supplement removed the game's dependency on the \"Chainmail\" rules, and made it much easier for new, non-wargaming players to grasp the concepts of play. It also inadvertently aided the growth of competing game publishers, since just about anyone who grasped the concepts behind the game could write smoother and easier to use rules systems and sell them to the growing \"D&D\" fanbase (\"Tunnels & Trolls\" being the first such).\n\nSupplements such as \"Greyhawk\", \"Blackmoor\", \"Eldritch Wizardry\" and \"Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes\", published over the next two years, greatly expanded the rules, character classes, monsters and spells. For example, the original \"Greyhawk\" supplement introduced the thief class, and weapon damage varying by weapon (as opposed to character class). In addition, many additions and options were published in the magazines \"The Strategic Review\" and its successor, \"The Dragon\".\n\nAn updated version of \"D&D\" was released between 1977 and 1979 as \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" (\"AD&D\"). The game rules were reorganized and re-codified across three hardcover rulebooks, compiled by Gary Gygax, incorporating the original \"D&D\" rules and many additions and revisions from supplements and magazine articles. The three core rulebooks were the \"Monster Manual\" (1977), the \"Player's Handbook\" (1978), and the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" (1979). Major additions included classes from supplements like assassin, druid, monk, paladin, and thief, while bard, illusionist, and ranger, which had previously only appeared in magazine articles, were added to the core rulebooks. An alignment system with nine alignments was used, rather than the previous three-alignment system in the original \"D&D\" rules.\n\nLater supplements for \"AD&D\" included \"Deities & Demigods\" (1980), \"Fiend Folio\" (another book of monsters produced semi-autonomously in the UK - 1981), \"Monster Manual II\" (1983), \"Oriental Adventures\", \"Unearthed Arcana\" (1985), which mostly compiled material previously published in \"Dragon\" magazine, and others.\n\nWhile \"AD&D\" was still in the works, TSR was approached by an outside writer and \"D&D\" enthusiast, John Eric Holmes, who offered to re-edit and rewrite the original rules into an introductory version of \"D&D\". Although TSR was focused on \"AD&D\" at the time, the project was seen as a profitable enterprise and a way to direct new players to anticipate the release of the \"AD&D\" game. It was published in July 1977 as the \"Basic Set\", collecting together and organizing the rules from the original \"D&D\" boxed set and \"Greyhawk\" supplement into a single booklet, which covered character levels 1 through 3, and included dice and a beginner's module. The booklet featured a blue cover with artwork by David C. Sutherland III. The \"blue booklet\" explained the game's concepts and method of play in terms that made it accessible to new players not familiar with tabletop miniatures wargaming. Unusual features of this version included an alignment system of five alignments as opposed to the three or nine alignments of the other versions. This \"Basic Set\" was very popular and allowed many to discover and experience the \"D&D\" game for the first time. Although the \"Basic Set\" is not fully compatible with \"AD&D\", as some rules were simplified to make the game easier for new players to learn, players were expected to continue play beyond third level by moving on to the \"AD&D\" version.\n\nOnce \"AD&D\" had been released, the \"Basic Set\" saw a major revision in 1981 by Tom Moldvay, which was immediately followed by the release of an \"Expert Set\" written by David Cook, to accompany the \"Basic Set\", extending it to levels 4 through 14, for players who preferred the simplified introductory ruleset. With this revision, the \"Basic\" rules became their own game, distinct both from original \"D&D\" and \"AD&D\". The revised \"Basic\" rules can be distinguished from the original ones by cover colors: the \"Basic\" booklet had a red cover, and the \"Expert\" booklet a blue one.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1985 this system was revised and expanded by Frank Mentzer as a series of five boxed sets, including the \"Basic Rules\" (red cover), \"Expert Rules\" (blue), \"Companion Rules\" (green, supporting levels 15 through 25), \"Master Rules\" (black, supporting levels 26 through 36), and \"Immortals Rules\" (gold, supporting Immortals—characters who had transcended levels).\n\nThis version was compiled and slightly revised by Aaron Allston in 1991 as the \"Rules Cyclopedia\", a hardback book which included all the sets except \"Immortals Rules\" which was discontinued and replaced with the \"Wrath of the Immortals\" boxed set accessory. While the \"Rules Cyclopedia\" included all information required to begin the game, there was a revised introductory boxed set, named \"The New Easy-to-Master Dungeons & Dragons Game\", nicknamed \"the black box\". A final repackaging of the introductory set, titled \"The Classic Dungeons & Dragons Game\" was released in 1994. By the end of 1995, TSR ended its support for the line.\n\nIn 1987, a small team of designers at TSR led by David \"Zeb\" Cook began work on the second edition of the \"AD&D\" game, which would take two years to complete. In 1989, \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\" was published, featuring new rules and characters.\n\nBy the end of its first decade, \"AD&D\" had expanded to several rulebooks, including three collections of monsters (\"Monster Manual\", \"Monster Manual II\", \"Fiend Folio\"), and two books governing character skills in wilderness and underground settings. Gygax had already planned a second edition for the game, which would also have been an update of the rules, incorporating the material from \"Unearthed Arcana\", \"Oriental Adventures\", and numerous new innovations from \"Dragon\" magazine in the \"Player's Handbook\" and \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" and would have consolidated the \"Monster Manual\", \"Monster Manual II\" and \"Fiend Folio\" into one volume. Initially, the 2nd edition was planned to consolidate the game, but more changes were made during development, while still aiming at backwards compatibility with 1st edition.\n\nThe release of \"AD&D 2nd Edition\" corresponded with important policy changes at TSR. An effort was made to remove aspects of the game which had attracted negative publicity, most notably the removal of all mention of demons and devils, although equivalent fiendish monsters were included, renamed tanar'ri and baatezu, respectively. Moving away from the moral ambiguity of the 1st edition \"AD&D\", the TSR staff eliminated character classes and races like the assassin and the half-orc, and stressed heroic roleplaying and player teamwork. The target age of the game was also lowered, with most 2nd edition products being aimed primarily at teenagers.\n\nThe game was again published as three core rulebooks which incorporated the expansions and revisions which had been published in various supplements over the previous decade. However, the \"Monster Manual\" was replaced by the \"Monstrous Compendium\", a loose-leaf binder in which every monster is given a full page of information. It was the intention that packs of new monsters (often setting-specific) could be purchased and added to the binder without the expense or inconvenience of a separate book, allowing the book to be updated and customized as needed. This format proved highly susceptibile to wear and tear, however, and presented difficulties in keeping alphabetic order when pages had been printed with monsters on each side. Subsequently, the loose leaf formatting was abandoned and the \"Compendium\" as a core book was replaced by single-volume hardcover \"Monstrous Manual\" in 1993, collecting popular monsters from the \"Compendium\". The edition also greatly increases the power of dragons, in order to counter the impression of relative weakness of the game's titular monster.\n\nNumerous mechanical changes were made to the game. The combat system was modified. The minimum number required to hit a target uses a mathematical formula in which the defender's armor class (AC) is subtracted from the attacker's THAC0 (\"To Hit Armor Class '0'\") number, a simplification of 1st edition's attack matrix tables that had appeared as an optional rule in the 1st edition \"DMG\". Distances are based on in-game units (feet) rather than miniatures-board ones (inches). Critical hits are offered as optional rules.\n\nCharacter creation is modified in many ways. Demi-human races are given higher level maximums to increase their long-term playability, though they are still restricted in terms of character class flexibility. Character classes are organized into four groups: warrior (fighter, paladin, ranger), wizard (mage, specialist wizard), priest (cleric, druid), and rogue (thief, bard). Assassins and monks were removed from the game as character classes, \"magic-users\" are renamed \"mages\", illusionists are made into a subtype of the wizard class, along with new classes specializing in the other schools of magic. Proficiencies are officially supported in the \"Player's Handbook\" and many supplements, rather than being an optional add-on. Psionics are no longer included in the \"Player's Handbook\", though they later appeared in their own supplement.\n\nIn 1995, TSR re-released the core rulebooks for 2nd Edition with new covers, art, and page layouts. These releases were followed shortly by a series of volumes labelled \"Player's Option\", allowing for alternate rules systems and character options, as well as a \"Dungeon Master Option\" for high-level campaigns. They consisted of:\n\nSome of the optional rules included the introduction of a point-based system to allow players to pick and choose parts of classes to make their own class, and a more tactical combat system including attacks of opportunity.\n\nA major revision of the \"AD&D\" rules was released in 2000. As the \"Basic\" game had been discontinued some years earlier, and the more straightforward title was more marketable, the word \"advanced\" was dropped and the new edition was named just \"Dungeons & Dragons\", but still officially referred to as 3rd edition (or \"3E\" for short). It is the basis of a broader role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the d20 System.\n\nMonte Cook, Jonathan Tweet, and Skip Williams all contributed to the 3rd edition \"Player's Handbook\", \"Dungeon Master's Guide\", and \"Monster Manual\", and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions.\n\nThe d20 system uses a more unified mechanic than earlier editions, resolving nearly all actions with a d20 die roll plus appropriate modifiers. Modifiers based on ability scores follow a standardized formula. Saving throws are reduced from five categories based on forms of attack to three based on type of defense.\n\nThe combat system is greatly expanded, adopting into the core system most of the optional movement and combat system of the 2nd edition \"Players Option: Combat and Tactics\" book. Third edition combat allows for a grid system, encouraging highly tactical gameplay and facilitating the use of miniatures.\n\nNew character options were introduced. The new sorcerer class was introduced. The thief is renamed rogue, a term that 2nd edition uses to classify both the thief and bard classes, and introduces prestige classes, which characters can only enter at higher character levels, and only if they meet certain character-design prerequisites or fulfill certain in-game goals. Later products included additional and supplementary rules subsystems such as \"epic-level\" options for characters above 20th level, as well as a heavily revised treatment of psionics.\n\n3rd edition removes previous editions' restrictions on class and race combinations that were intended to track the preferences of the race, and on the level advancement of non-human characters. Skills and the new system of feats are introduced replacing non-weapon proficiencies, to allow players to further customize their characters.\n\nThe d20 System is presented under the Open Game License, which makes it an open source system for which authors can write new games and game supplements without the need to develop a unique rules system and, more importantly, without the need for direct approval from Wizards of the Coast. This makes it easier to market D&D-compatible content under a broadly recognizable commercial license.\n\nIn July 2003, a revised version of the 3rd edition \"D&D\" rules (termed \"v. 3.5\") was released that incorporated numerous small rule changes, as well as expanding the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" and \"Monster Manual\". This revision was intentionally a small one focusing on addressing common complaints about certain aspects of gameplay, hence the \"half edition\" version number. The basic rules are fundamentally the same, only differing in balancing. Many monsters and items are compatible (or even unchanged) between those editions. New spells are added, and numerous changes are made to existing spells, while some spells are removed from the updated \"Player's Handbook\". New feats are added and numerous changes are made to existing feats, while several skills are renamed or merged with other skills.\n\nOn August 15, 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced the development of \"D&D\" 4th edition. In December 2007, the book \"\", the first preview of 4th Edition, was released. This was followed by a second book in January 2008 named \"\". The \"Player's Handbook\", \"Monster Manual\", and \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" were released in June 2008.\n\nSlashdot reported anger from some players and retailers due to the financial investment in v3.5 and the relatively brief period of time that it had been in publication. Although many players chose to continue playing older editions, or other games such as \"Pathfinder\" by Paizo Publishing (itself based on \"D&D\" v3.5 via the OGL), the initial print run of the 4th edition sold out during preorders, and Wizards of the Coast announced a second print run prior to the game's official release.\n\nUnlike previous editions with just three core rulebooks, 4th edition core rules include multiple volumes of the \"Player's Handbook\", \"Dungeon Master's Guide\", and \"Monster Manual\" that were released yearly, with each new book becoming a part of the core. In the first \"Player's Handbook\", the warlock and warlord are included, while the barbarian, bard, druid, sorcerer and monk are not present. Of those classes, the first four were included in \"Player's Handbook 2\", while the monk class appears in \"Player's Handbook 3\".\n\nMechanically, 4th edition saw a major overhaul of the game's systems. Changes in spells and other per-encounter resourcing, giving all classes a similar number of at-will, per-encounter and per-day \"powers\". Powers have a wide range of effects including inflicting status effects, creating zones, and forced movement, making combat very tactical for all classes but essentially requiring use of miniatures, reinforced by the use of squares to express distances. Attack rolls, skill checks and defense values all get a bonus equal to one-half level, rounded down, rather than increasing at different rates depending on class or skill point investment. Each skill is either trained (providing a fixed bonus on skill checks, and sometimes allowing more exotic uses for the skills) or untrained, but in either case all characters also receive a bonus to all skill rolls based on level. A system of \"healing surges\" and short and long rests are introduced to act as resource management.\n\nThe system of prestige classes is replaced by a system in which characters at 11th level choose a \"paragon path\", a specialty based on their class, which defines some of their new powers through 20th level; at level 21, an \"epic destiny\" is chosen in a similar manner. Core rules extend to level 30 rather than level 20, bringing \"epic level\" play back into the core rules.\n\nThis product line debuted in September 2010 and consisted of ten products intended to lower the barrier of entry into the game. \"Essentials\" uses the \"D&D\" 4th edition rule set and provides simple player character options intended for first-time players. Many of the new player character options emulated features from previous editions, such as schools of magic for the wizard class, as to appeal to older players who had not adopted 4th edition.\n\nThe \"Essentials\" line contained revisions to the ruleset compiled over the prior two years, in the form of the \"Rules Compendium\", which condensed rules and errata into one volume, while also updating the rules with newly introduced changes. The player books \"Heroes of the Fallen Lands\" and \"Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms\" contained rules for creating characters, as well as new builds for each class described in the books. Other \"Essentials\" releases included a \"Dungeon Master's Kit\" and \"Monster Vault\", each also containing accessories.\n\nIn January 2012, Wizards of the Coast announced that a new edition of the game, at the time referred to as \"D&D Next\", was under development. In direct contrast to the previous editions of the game, \"D&D Next\" was developed partly via a public open playtest. An early build of the new edition debuted at the 2012 \"Dungeons & Dragons Experience\" event to about 500 fans. Public playtesting began on May 24, 2012, with the final playtest packet released on September 20, 2013.\n\nThe 5th edition's \"Basic Rules\", a free PDF containing complete rules for play and a subset of the player and DM content from the core rulebooks, was released on July 3, 2014. The \"Starter Set\" was released on July 15, featuring a set of pre-generated characters, a set of instructions for basic play, and the adventure module \"Lost Mine of Phandelver\". The \"Player's Handbook\" was released on August 19, 2014. The fifth edition \"Monster Manual\" was released on September 30, 2014. The \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" was released on December 9, 2014. The edition returns to having only three core rule books, with the \"Player’s Handbook\" containing most major races and classes.\n\nMechanically, 5th edition draws heavily on prior editions, while introducing some new mechanics intended to simplify and streamline play.\n\nSkills, weapons, items, saving throws, and other things that characters are trained in now all use a single proficiency bonus that increases as character level increases. Multiple defense values have been removed, returning to a single defense value of armor class and using more traditional saving throws. Saving throws are reworked to be situational checks based on the six core abilities instead of generic d20 rolls. Feats are now optional features that can be taken instead of ability score increases and are reworked to be occasional major upgrades instead of frequent minor upgrades.\n\nThe \"advantage/disadvantage\" mechanic was introduced, streamlining conditional and situational modifiers to a simpler mechanic: rolling two d20s for a situation and taking the higher of the two for \"advantage\" and the lower of the two for \"disadvantage\" and canceling each other out when more than one apply.\n\nThe power system of 4th edition was replaced with more traditional class features that are gained as characters level. Clerics, druids, paladins, and wizards prepare known spells using a slightly modified version of the spell preparation system of previous editions. Healing Surges are replaced by Hit Dice, requiring a character to roll a hit die during a short rest instead of healing a flat rate of hit points.\n\nKenzer & Company received permission from Wizards of the Coast to produce a parody version of 1st and 2nd edition \"AD&D\". They published the humorously numbered \"HackMaster\" 4th edition from 2001 until they lost their license. The game was well received and won the Origins Award for \"Game of the Year 2001\". A new edition of \"Hackmaster\" was released in 2011 that no longer uses \"AD&D\" mechanics as Kenzer & Company's license expired.\n\nThe publication of the System Reference Document (SRD) for 3rd edition under the Open Game License (OGL) allowed other companies to use the rules to create their own variants of \"Dungeons & Dragons\", providing that they did not use anything Wizards of the Coast considered trade dress or signature content, known as \"product identity\" under the terms of the OGL. In January 2016, Wizards of the Coast published an updated SRD for 5th edition D&D.\n\n\"Castles & Crusades\", published in 2004 by Troll Lord Games, is an early example of the OGL and SRD being used to recreate the experience of older editions.\n\n\"Retro-clones\" are variants created to even more closely simulate previous editions, part of a movement known as the Old School Revival. Prominent retro-clones include \"Labyrinth Lord\", \"OSRIC\", and \"Swords & Wizardry\".\n\nThe \"Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\" was first published in 2009 by Paizo Publishing. It is intended to be backward-compatible with \"D&D\" v. 3.5 while adjusting some rules balance, and has been nicknamed \"v. 3.75\" by some fans. Pathfinder has been one of the best-selling role playing games in the industry. A second edition, which moves away from the v. 3.5 mechanics, was published in 2019.\n\n\"13th Age\" is a game designed by Jonathan Tweet, a lead designer of the 3rd Edition, and Rob Heinsoo, a lead designer of 4th Edition, and published by Pelgrane Press in 2013.\n\nThe \"D&D\" franchise has been translated and published in several languages around the world.\n\nA particular challenge has been the word dungeon, which in standard English means a single prison cell or oubliette originally located under a keep. Some languages, like Spanish, Italian, Finnish, and Portuguese, didn't translate the title of the game and kept it as it is in English: \"Dungeons & Dragons\". In Spanish-speaking countries, the 1983 animated series was translated in Hispanic America as \"Calabozos y Dragones\" and in Spain as \"Dragones y Mazmorras\" (\"calabozo\" and \"mazmorra\" have in all Spanish-speaking countries the same meaning: a dungeon). In Brazil, the same animated series was translated as \"Caverna do Dragão\" (\"Dragon's Cave\"). This still brings great confusion amongst Spanish-speaking and Brazilian gamers about the name of the game, since all Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese translations of the game kept the original English title. In gaming jargon, however, a dungeon is not a single holding cell but rather a network of underground passages or subterranea to be explored, such as a cave, ruins or catacombs. Some translations conveyed this meaning well, e.g. Chinese \"龙与地下城\" (\"Dragons and Underground Castles\", or \"Dragons and Underground Cities\"). Some translations used a false friend of \"dungeon\", even if it changed the meaning of the title, such as the French \"Donjons et dragons\" (\"Keeps and Dragons\"). In Hebrew, the game was published as \"מבוכים ודרקונים\" (\"Labyrinths and Dragons\"). Additionally, some translations adopted the English word \"dungeon\" as a game term, leaving it untranslated in the text as well.\n\n\n"}

The district is located on the European side and extends over the shores of Cendere, the stream that discharges into the Golden Horn. The Cendere Valley is surrounded by the Sarıyer, Eyüp, Şişli, Beşiktaş, and Beyoğlu districts. The mayor is Fazlı Kılıç of Ak Parti. Kâğıthane was part of Beyoğlu until 1954 and part of Şişli between 1954 and 1987.\n\nIn the time of Suleiman the Magnificent Kâğıthane, which was called 'Sadabad', was a large forested land and frequented by the Ottoman court for hunting, riding and all other kind of equestrian activities. In the following centuries, Sadabad became a centre of recreation with its clean waters, tulip fields, promenades and festivities. There are a lot of engravings and paintings depicting gatherings in Sadabad, such as weddings or picnics. Later, in the 17th and 18th centuries, mansions and summer palaces were built in the area. \n\nIn the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, the strategically and logistically well located area was turned into a zone of industry. Kâğıthane then became home to numerous factories including flour mills and the paper factories. The district was named after these paper factories and came to be called as \"Kâğıt hane\" (paper house). Although it is known that from time to time gypsies, nomadic people, trade or hadj caravans were hosted in the region, there was no settlement therein until the late 20th century.\n\nThe settlement in Kâğıthane started as illegal slums from the 1950s onwards, as the city received thousands of migrants from Anatolia, who came to work in the factories, building sites or services sector. With the passage of time, the illegal settlements were legalised and gradually replaced by residentially-zoned buildings. \n\nDue to its central location, especially its connections with the new intra-city transport networks, and the entry into force of urban regeneration legislation, Kâğıthane is transforming. To the north, the district will serve as a hub after the completion of the construction of the third airport (new airport), third bridge and three-storey under water tunnel (that will join the European side at the Hasdal junction in the district).

The locomotive involved was GWR King Class \"King George VI\" which was subsequently repaired and returned to service. A previous significant accident occurred here on 10 November 1890 and the Taunton train fire of 1978 was also within 2 miles.\n\nThe house of the driver, Percy Stacey, had been bombed the previous night. He had gone to work as usual. Further bombing on the night of the accident and other disruptions had made the train an hour late by the time it reached Taunton.\n\nThe crash occurred at a point on the railway where four tracks were reduced to two. On the four-track section, the up and down fast lines were in the centre between the up and down slow lines. Instead of the usual practice of locating all signals on the same side of their respective tracks (GWR practice was to commonly put them to the right of the track, the same side their drivers stood on the locomotive), the Relief Line signals were on the left, and the Main Line signals were on the right.\n\nStacey's train left Taunton station observing the indications of the right-hand signals (all green, indicating \"proceed\" for the Down Main line), not realizing his train was travelling on the Down Relief (left-hand) track and the signals were showing clear for another train coming from behind on the adjacent track. Wartime blackout conditions at night contributed to this misapprehension. The driver only realised his mistake when the other train overtook him, by which time it was too late to stop before the track ended. As trap points were in place, the train was derailed rather than running onto the fast line and colliding with the other train. The fireman and 26 passengers were killed.\n\nThe guard in the end vehicle of the overtaking train was alarmed by strange noises, which later turned out to be ballast thrown up by the derailing train alongside. He applied his own brakes to check what might be the problem, the train was stopped at Victory Siding, the next signalbox to the west, and he discovered the sides of the last vehicles were scored from flying ballast, and there were broken windows. The derailing \"King\" locomotive had nosed down off the end of the overrun siding and then swung across the main tracks, what must have been feet behind the overtaking train.\n\nAlso, the signalman at Taunton station had initially cleared the starting signal for the usual route at the west end of the platform, to cross over to the Down Main line, which was showing when the train stopped at the platform. While the train was stopped the signalman was offered the faster non-stopping train, so restored the signal, changed the route of the crashed train from the Down Fast to the Down Slow, and cleared the Down Slow signal. The driver was on the opposite side of the locomotive to the signal, and the fireman, who performed a second check at departure, reported as usual \"it's clear\". Because of the slow speed of departure, in blackout conditions, the driver never noticed they were now continuing on the Down Relief line and not taking the crossover to the Down Main.\n\nThe signals had been badly placed as an economy measure. If at least one pair of signals had been placed as usual – requiring a gantry or a bracket – then the driver of the train would have been more likely to recognise which track he was on and which signals related to it.\n\nThe extra space between the Fast lines was a hangover from the wide track centres of Brunel's broad gauge.\n\nThe signals at Norton Fitzwarren railway station were fitted with the GWR Automatic Train Control (ATC) which alerted the driver, in the cab, audibly that the approaching distant signal is at \"caution\". A warning signal has to be acknowledged or the brakes are applied. Unfortunately, drivers can be so used to cancelling the warning, that they may do this subconsciously. This would especially happen if the driver is reading the wrong green signal. Although the ATC equipment was working correctly, wartime deferred maintenance had meant that in a number of cases the ATC ramps were not working correctly and were giving false \"caution\" alerts when the signals were clear, supposedly a correct failure mode but one which led to crews believing that a warning when they saw clear signals was just another maintenance issue.\n\nThe inquiry was conducted by the Chief Inspecting Officer of the Railway Inspectorate, Sir Alan Mount. He concluded that although the position of the signals was confusing, the \"sole cause was an unaccountable lapse on the part of Driver P.W. Stacey\" despite his excellent record of 40 years of service. He suggested that operating under conditions of blackout and the general strain of the war, including Stacey's own house being bombed the previous night, may have been a factor in this lapse.\n\nThis accident was reported soon after in newspapers in far off Australia. The cause was attributed to a culvert washaway caused by recent heavy rains, and no mention was made that the locomotive was a namesake of the reigning monarch, which would not be a good omen. \n\nDespite a considerable amount of sympathy for Driver Stacey, he never forgave himself for the accident. When asked for a comment by the press, he said \"don't talk to me, I'm a murderer\". He died just over a year later for no apparent medical reason.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1810098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810098", "title": "Structure formation", "text": "Structure formation\n\nIn physical cosmology, structure formation is the formation of galaxies, galaxy clusters and larger structures from small early density fluctuations. The universe, as is now known from observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, began in a hot, dense, nearly uniform state approximately 13.8 billion years ago. However, looking in the sky today, we see structures on all scales, from stars and planets to galaxies and, on still larger scales, galaxy clusters and sheet-like structures of galaxies separated by enormous voids containing few galaxies. Structure formation attempts to model how these structures formed by gravitational instability of small early density ripples.\n\nThe modern Lambda-CDM model is successful at predicting the observed large-scale distribution of galaxies, clusters and voids; but on the scale of individual galaxies there are many complications due to highly nonlinear processes involving baryonic physics, gas heating and cooling, star formation and feedback. Understanding the processes of galaxy formation is a major topic of modern cosmology research, both via observations such as the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field and via large computer simulations.\n\nUnder present models, the structure of the visible universe was formed in the following stages:\n\nIn this stage, some mechanism, such as cosmic inflation, was responsible for establishing the initial conditions of the universe: homogeneity, isotropy, and flatness. Cosmic inflation also would have amplified minute quantum fluctuations (pre-inflation) into slight density ripples of overdensity and underdensity (post-inflation).\n\nThe early universe was dominated by radiation; in this case density fluctuations larger than the cosmic horizon grow proportional to the scale factor, as the gravitational potential fluctuations remain constant. Structures smaller than the horizon remained essentially frozen due to radiation domination impeding growth. As the universe expanded, the density of radiation drops faster than matter (due to redshifting of photon energy); this led to a crossover called matter-radiation equality at ~ 50,000 years after the Big Bang. After this all dark matter ripples could grow freely, forming seeds into which the baryons could later fall. The size of the universe at this epoch forms a turnover in the matter power spectrum which can be measured in large redshift surveys.\n\nThe universe was dominated by radiation for most of this stage, and due to the intense heat and radiation, the primordial hydrogen and helium were fully ionized into nuclei and free electrons. In this hot and dense situation, the radiation (photons) could not travel far before Thomson scattering off an electron. The universe was very hot and dense, but expanding rapidly and therefore cooling. Finally, at a little less than 400,000 years after the 'bang', it became cool enough (around 3000 K) for the protons to capture negatively charged electrons, forming neutral hydrogen atoms. (Helium atoms formed somewhat earlier due to their larger binding energy). Once nearly all the charged particles were bound in neutral atoms, the photons no longer interacted with them and were free to propagate for the next 13.8 billion years; we currently detect those photons redshifted by a factor 1090 down to 2.725 K as the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) filling today's universe. Several remarkable space-based missions (COBE, WMAP, Planck), have detected very slight variations in the density and temperature of the CMB. These variations were subtle, and the CMB appears very nearly uniformly the same in every direction. However, the slight temperature variations of order a few parts in 100,000 are of enormous importance, for they essentially were early \"seeds\" from which all subsequent complex structures in the universe ultimately developed.\n\nThe theory of what happened after the universe's first 400,000 years is one of hierarchical structure formation: the smaller gravitationally bound structures such as matter peaks containing the first stars and stellar clusters formed first, and these subsequently merged with gas and dark matter to form galaxies, followed by groups, clusters and superclusters of galaxies.\n\nThe very early universe is still a poorly understood epoch, from the viewpoint of fundamental physics. The prevailing theory, cosmic inflation, does a good job explaining the observed flatness, homogeneity and isotropy of the universe, as well as the absence of exotic relic particles (such as magnetic monopoles). Another prediction borne out by observation is that tiny perturbations in the primordial universe seed the later formation of structure. These fluctuations, while they form the foundation for all structure, appear most clearly as tiny temperature fluctuations at one part in 100,000. (To put this in perspective, the same level of fluctuations on a topographic map of the United States would show no feature taller than a few centimeters.) These fluctuations are critical, because they provide the seeds from which the largest structures can grow and eventually collapse to form galaxies and stars. COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) provided the first detection of the intrinsic fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation in the 1990s.\n\nThese perturbations are thought to have a very specific character: they form a Gaussian random field whose covariance function is diagonal and nearly scale-invariant. Observed fluctuations appear to have exactly this form, and in addition the \"spectral index\" measured by WMAP—the spectral index measures the deviation from a scale-invariant (or Harrison-Zel'dovich) spectrum—is very nearly the value predicted by the simplest and most robust models of inflation. Another important property of the primordial perturbations, that they are adiabatic (or isentropic between the various kinds of matter that compose the universe), is predicted by cosmic inflation and has been confirmed by observations.\n\nOther theories of the very early universe have been proposed that are claimed to make similar predictions, such as the brane gas cosmology, cyclic model, pre-big bang model and holographic universe, but they remain nascent and are not widely accepted. Some theories, such as cosmic strings, have largely been refuted by increasingly precise data.\n\nAn important concept in structure formation is the notion of the Hubble radius, often called simply the \"horizon,\" as it is closely related to the particle horizon. The Hubble radius, which is related to the Hubble parameter formula_1 as formula_2, where formula_3 is the speed of light, defines, roughly speaking, the volume of the nearby universe that has recently (in the last expansion time) been in causal contact with an observer. Since the universe is continually expanding, its energy density is continually decreasing (in the absence of truly exotic matter such as phantom energy). The Friedmann equation relates the energy density of the universe to the Hubble parameter and shows that the Hubble radius is continually increasing.\n\nThe horizon problem of big bang cosmology says that, without inflation, perturbations were never in causal contact before they entered the horizon and thus the homogeneity and isotropy of, for example, the large scale galaxy distributions cannot be explained. This is because, in an ordinary Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker cosmology, the Hubble radius increases more rapidly than space expands, so perturbations only enter the Hubble radius, and are not pushed out by the expansion. This paradox is resolved by cosmic inflation, which suggests that during a phase of rapid expansion in the early universe the Hubble radius was nearly constant. Thus, large scale isotropy is due to quantum fluctuations produced during cosmic inflation that are pushed outside the horizon.\n\nThe end of inflation is called reheating, when the inflation particles decay into a hot, thermal plasma of other particles. In this epoch, the energy content of the universe is entirely radiation, with standard model particles having relativistic velocities. As the plasma cools, baryogenesis and leptogenesis are thought to occur, as the quark–gluon plasma cools, electroweak symmetry breaking occurs and the universe becomes principally composed of ordinary protons, neutrons and electrons. As the universe cools further, Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurs and small quantities of deuterium, helium and lithium nuclei are created. As the universe cools and expands, the energy in photons begins to redshift away, particles become non-relativistic and ordinary matter begins to dominate the universe. Eventually, atoms begin to form as free electrons bind to nuclei. This suppresses Thomson scattering of photons. Combined with the rarefaction of the universe (and consequent increase in the mean free path of photons), this makes the universe transparent and the cosmic microwave background is emitted at recombination (the \"surface of last scattering\").\n\nThe primordial plasma would have had very slight overdensities of matter, thought to have derived from the enlargement of quantum fluctuations during inflation. Whatever the source, these overdensities gravitationally attract matter. But the intense heat of the near constant photon-matter interactions of this epoch rather forcefully seeks thermal equilibrium, which creates a large amount of outward pressure. These counteracting forces of gravity and pressure create oscillations, analogous to sound waves created in air by pressure differences.\n\nThese perturbations are important, as they are responsible for the subtle physics that result in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy. In this epoch, the amplitude of perturbations that enter the horizon oscillate sinusoidally, with dense regions becoming more rarefied and then becoming dense again, with a frequency which is related to the size of the perturbation. If the perturbation oscillates an integral or half-integral number of times between coming into the horizon and recombination, it appears as an acoustic peak of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy. (A half-oscillation, in which a dense region becomes a rarefied region or vice versa, appears as a peak because the anisotropy is displayed as a \"power spectrum\", so underdensities contribute to the power just as much as overdensities.) The physics that determines the detailed peak structure of the microwave background is complicated, but these oscillations provide the essence.\n\nOne of the key realizations made by cosmologists in the 1970s and 1980s was that the majority of the matter content of the universe was composed not of atoms, but rather a mysterious form of matter known as dark matter. Dark matter interacts through the force of gravity, but it is not composed of baryons, and it is known with very high accuracy that it does not emit or absorb radiation. It may be composed of particles that interact through the weak interaction, such as neutrinos, but it cannot be composed entirely of the three known kinds of neutrinos (although some have suggested it is a sterile neutrino). Recent evidence indicates that there are about five times as much dark matter as baryonic matter, and thus the dynamics of the universe in this epoch are dominated by dark matter.\n\nDark matter plays a crucial role in structure formation because it feels only the force of gravity: the gravitational Jeans instability which allows compact structures to form is not opposed by any force, such as radiation pressure. As a result, dark matter begins to collapse into a complex network of dark matter halos well before ordinary matter, which is impeded by pressure forces. Without dark matter, the epoch of galaxy formation would occur substantially later in the universe than is observed.\n\nThe physics of structure formation in this epoch is particularly simple, as dark matter perturbations with different wavelengths evolve independently. As the Hubble radius grows in the expanding universe, it encompasses larger and larger disturbances. During matter domination, all causal dark matter perturbations grow through gravitational clustering. However, the shorter-wavelength perturbations that are included during radiation domination have their growth retarded until matter domination. At this stage, luminous, baryonic matter is expected to mirror the evolution of the dark matter simply, and their distributions should closely trace one another.\n\nIt is straightforward to calculate this \"linear power spectrum\" and, as a tool for cosmology, it is of comparable importance to the cosmic microwave background. Galaxy surveys have measured the power spectrum, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and by surveys of the Lyman-α forest. Since these studies observe radiation emitted from galaxies and quasars, they do not directly measure the dark matter, but the large-scale distribution of galaxies (and of absorption lines in the Lyman-α forest) is expected to mirror the distribution of dark matter closely. This depends on the fact that galaxies will be larger and more numerous in denser parts of the universe, whereas they will be comparatively scarce in rarefied regions.\n\nWhen the perturbations have grown sufficiently, a small region might become substantially denser than the mean density of the universe. At this point, the physics involved becomes substantially more complicated. When the deviations from homogeneity are small, the dark matter may be treated as a pressureless fluid and evolves by very simple equations. In regions which are significantly denser than the background, the full Newtonian theory of gravity must be included. (The Newtonian theory is appropriate because the masses involved are much less than those required to form a black hole, and the speed of gravity may be ignored as the light-crossing time for the structure is still smaller than the characteristic dynamical time.) One sign that the linear and fluid approximations become invalid is that dark matter starts to form caustics in which the trajectories of adjacent particles cross, or particles start to form orbits. These dynamics are best understood using \"N\"-body simulations (although a variety of semi-analytic schemes, such as the Press–Schechter formalism, can be used in some cases). While in principle these simulations are quite simple, in practice they are tough to implement, as they require simulating millions or even billions of particles. Moreover, despite the large number of particles, each particle typically weighs 10 solar masses and discretization effects may become significant. The largest such simulation as of 2005 is the Millennium simulation.\n\nThe result of \"N\"-body simulations suggests that the universe is composed largely of voids, whose densities might be as low as one-tenth the cosmological mean. The matter condenses in large filaments and haloes which have an intricate web-like structure. These form galaxy groups, clusters and superclusters. While the simulations appear to agree broadly with observations, their interpretation is complicated by the understanding of how dense accumulations of dark matter spur galaxy formation. In particular, many more small haloes form than we see in astronomical observations as dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. This is known as the galaxy bias problem, and a variety of explanations have been proposed. Most account for it as an effect in the complicated physics of galaxy formation, but some have suggested that it is a problem with our model of dark matter and that some effect, such as warm dark matter, prevents the formation of the smallest haloes.\n\nThe final stage in evolution comes when baryons condense in the centres of galaxy haloes to form galaxies, stars and quasars. Dark matter greatly accelerates the formation of dense haloes. As dark matter does not have radiation pressure, the formation of smaller structures from dark matter is impossible. This is because dark matter cannot dissipate angular momentum, whereas ordinary baryonic matter can collapse to form dense objects by dissipating angular momentum through radiative cooling. Understanding these processes is an enormously difficult computational problem, because they can involve the physics of gravity, magnetohydrodynamics, atomic physics, nuclear reactions, turbulence and even general relativity. In most cases, it is not yet possible to perform simulations that can be compared quantitatively with observations, and the best that can be achieved are approximate simulations that illustrate the main qualitative features of a process such as a star formation.\n\nMuch of the difficulty, and many of the disputes, in understanding the large-scale structure of the universe can be resolved by better understanding the choice of gauge in general relativity. By the scalar-vector-tensor decomposition, the metric includes four scalar perturbations, two vector perturbations, and one tensor perturbation. Only the scalar perturbations are significant: the vectors are exponentially suppressed in the early universe, and the tensor mode makes only a small (but important) contribution in the form of primordial gravitational radiation and the B-modes of the cosmic microwave background polarization. Two of the four scalar modes may be removed by a physically meaningless coordinate transformation. Which modes are eliminated determine the infinite number of possible gauge fixings. The most popular gauge is Newtonian gauge (and the closely related conformal Newtonian gauge), in which the retained scalars are the Newtonian potentials Φ and Ψ, which correspond exactly to the Newtonian potential energy from Newtonian gravity. Many other gauges are used, including synchronous gauge, which can be an efficient gauge for numerical computation (it is used by CMBFAST). Each gauge still includes some unphysical degrees of freedom. There is a so-called gauge-invariant formalism, in which only gauge invariant combinations of variables are considered.\n\nThe initial conditions for the universe are thought to arise from the scale invariant quantum mechanical fluctuations of cosmic inflation. The perturbation of the background energy density at a given point formula_4 in space is then given by an isotropic, homogeneous Gaussian random field of mean zero. This means that the spatial Fourier transform of formula_5 – formula_6 has the following correlation functions\nwhere formula_8 is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function and formula_9 is the length of formula_10. Moreover, the spectrum predicted by inflation is nearly scale invariant, which means\nwhere formula_12 is a small number. Finally, the initial conditions are adiabatic or isentropic, which means that the fractional perturbation in the entropy of each species of particle is equal.\nThe resulting predictions fit very well with observations, however there is a conceptual problem with the physical picture presented above. The quantum state from which the quantum fluctuations are extracted, is in fact completely homogeneous and isotropic, and thus it can not be argued that the quantum fluctuations represent the primordial inhomogeneities and anisotropies. The interpretation of quantum uncertainties in the value of the inflation field (which is what the so-called quantum fluctuations really are) as if they were statistical fluctuations in a Gaussian random field does not follow from the application of standard rules of quantum theory. The issue is sometimes presented in terms of the \"quantum to classical transition\", which is a confusing manner to refer to the problem at hand, as there are very few physicists, if any, that would argue that there is any entity that is truly classical at the fundamental level. In fact, the consideration of these issues brings us face to face with the so called measurement problem in quantum theory. If anything, the problem becomes exacerbated in the cosmological context, as the early universe contains no entities that might be taken as playing the role of \"observers\" or of \"measuring devices\", both of which are essential for the standard usage of quantum mechanics.\nThe most popular posture among cosmologists, in this regard, is to rely on arguments based on decoherence and some form of \"Many Worlds Interpretation\" of quantum theory. There is an intense ongoing debate about the reasonableness of that posture \n\n"}

The mayor is Ömer Arısoy (AKP).\n\nZeytinburnu was a fortress and settlement known as Kyklobion () or Strongylon () during the Byzantine period, its name referring to the circular shape of the fortress.\n\nThe fortress was built in Late Antiquity as part of a series of strongholds that guarded the coastal road leading to Constantinople. It is first attested during the reign of Justinian I (527–565). Kyklobion was used as the landing-site of the Arab armies on both of their assaults on Constantinople, in 674 and in 717. In the early 8th century, the iconodule Saint Hilarion was kept prisoner in the local monastery on the orders of Emperor Leo V the Armenian (r. 813–820). The site is again, and for the last time in Byzantine times, mentioned in a property deed of 1388.\n\nAfter the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the name Kyklobion was transferred to the Yedikule Fortress by the local Greeks, and the original site was abandoned. Ruins of the original circular fortress survived until the 19th century, where the Austrian traveller Hammer-Purgstall saw them. Its name at the time was called in Greek Elaion Akra, \"Cape of the Olive Trees\"; the modern Turkish name has the same meaning.\n\nFrom the early 19th century onwards Zeytinburnu was an industrial village, centred on the leather industry of the area called Kazlıçeşme, which being on the coast with a good water supply was well suited to leather production. (the area was named for a fountain with a goose carved into the stonework, the fountain is still in existence). Up until the mid-20th century the residents were an urban mix of Greeks, Armenians, Bulgarians, Jews and Turks and still today the Yedikule Surp Pırgiç Armenian Hospital is active in Kazlıçeşme, and has a museum in the grounds.\n\nThe character of Zeytinburnu changed when a large wave of immigrants from Anatolia came and settled there from 1950 on. Zeytinburnu is an important lesson for city planning in Turkey, because it was one of the first \"Gecekondu\" districts. In other words, most of the buildings were built illegally, without infrastructure, and without any aesthetical concern. In the 1960s legislation was passed to prevent this type of building but by then this type of development had become unstoppable. At first these were little brick-built single storey cottages. From the 1970s onwards the little houses were replaced by multi-storey concrete apartment blocks built in rows with no space in between. In most cases the ground floor was used as a small textile workshop, and thus Zeytinburnu became a bustling industrial area with a large residential population living above the workshops. All this was still illegal and unplanned and still lacked the infrastructure and the aesthetics. After a heavy rain the streets would run with dirty water for days.\n\nThe leather industry has largely moved out to Tuzla now but the rows of six-storey blocks of housing and textiles remains. Although some improvements have been made to the streets and drainage the area still has a reputation for being the home of tough men and uncontrollable youths who drive around in cars blasting out pop music at high-volume. Possibly this is exaggerated nowadays, and steps are being taken to smarten up the area. Most residents are working class, recent migrants from Anatolia, typically lacking in education. However, the younger generations are more educated thus changing the shape of Zeytinburnu.\n\nTo integrate the district with the rest of Istanbul, the municipality has improved the transportation by extending the modern tram line to Zeytinburnu, and the main tram station is now at the intersection of the metro line leading to Atatürk International Airport and Aksaray and fast tram lines leading to Istanbul's inter-city coach station and the old city in Eminönü. Moreover, Zeytinburnu has a station on the suburban railway line Sirkeci-Halkalı. Other important projects have improved the transportation, life quality and the economics of the district. Olivium Outlet Center was opened in 2000 \n, a modern shopping mall with cinemas, but with many shops specializing in factory surpluses, this has brought new shopping opportunities for the people of Zeytinburnu and surrounding districts, it's very crowded at weekends.\n\nThere is an Alevi community served by the Erikli Baba Cemevi\n\nThere are large minority groups of Kazakhs and Turkmens, who generally work in the textile, clothing industry contributing to the Turkish economy.\n\nThe Zeytinburnu-based NASCO NASREDDIN HOLDING A.S. was categorized as an Al-Qaeda ally by the United Nations. It was involved in terrorist finance. The Romanian government legislated this status for Zeytinburnu Nasco Nasreddin Holding A. S. and the Slovakian government.\n\nOn December 10, 2014, in Zeytinburnu, an assassin killed the anti-Uzbekistan government Islamist Uzbek Imam Shaykh Abdullah Bukhoroy (Abdullah Bukhari). It took place outside of a Madrassa. The Islamist organization Hizb ut-Tahrir released statements on Islamist websites which attacked the Uzbekistan government of Islam Karimov and blamed them for the assassination. The Uyghur Eastern Turkistan Education and Solidarity Association (ETESA) and Uzbek Islamist exiles demonstrated against the assassination and denounced Putin and the Uzbek government under Karimov in the Fatih district of Istanbul.\n\nTurkish connections were used by Uyghur fighters to go into Syria (Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria) and the humanitarian Uyghur Eastern Turkistan Education and Solidarity Association (ETESA) which is located in Turkey sent Uyghurs into Syria, endorsed the killing of the pro-China Imam Juma Tayir, applauded attacks in China, and posted on its website content from the Turkistan Islamic Party. Turkish passports were used by Uyghurs who were seeking to contact Mujahidin Indonesia Timor, a pro-ISIS organization in Sulawesi in Indonesia.\n\nThe Turkish run English language BGNNews news agency reported that the Turkish Meydan newspaper discovered that Uyghur fighters joining the Islamist terrorist organization ISIL were being helped by businessman Nurali T., who led an Zeytinburnu district based network in Istanbul, which produced counterfeit Turkish passports numbering up to 100,000 to give to Uyghurs from China and help them go to Turkey form where they would enter Iraq and Syria to join ISIL, Uyghurs from China travel to Malaysia via Cambodia and Thailand and then travel onto Turkey, since a visa is not needed for travel between Turkey and Malaysia, then staying at locations in Istanbul, and then going to Iraq and Syria by traveling to southeastern Turkey, the information was revealed by AG who participates in the network, he noted that even though Turkish authorities are able to detect the fake passports they do not deport the Uyghurs and allow them into Turkey, AG said that: \"“Turkey has secret dealings with the Uighurs. The authorities first confiscate the passports but then release the individuals.”\" Uyghurs were routed into Syria by way of Zeytinburnu by Turkey.\n\nThe Uyghur diaspora in the Küçükçekmece, Sefaköy, and Zeytinburnu districts of Istanbul, Turkey, are the source of Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party Jihadists in Syria. The Turkey-based Uyghur website \"Doğu Türkistan Bülteni\", which supports the Turkistan Islamic Party, reported that the Uyghur diaspora in Küçükçekmece and Zeytinburnu were in fear after the assassination of Uzbek Imam Abdullah Bukhari and the Uyghurs were panicking over reports of Chinese loyalist Uyghur agents sent to Istanbul to hunt down separatist Uyghurs as Russia, Iran, and Assad were fighting against the Turkmens and Turkestan Islamic Party Uyghur fighters.\n\nThe funeral of the Turkish Nationalist Movement Party member İbrahim Küçük took place in Zeytinburnu after he died due to Russian bombing in the Jabal al Turkman area of Syria.\n\nUyghur workers at a restaurant provided money in Zeytinburnu to the terrorist who committed the nightclub massacre at Reina for his taxi fare. The Seferoğlu Sokak based Uyghurs in Zeytinburnu aided the attacker when he fled the nightclub. The 7 Uyghurs were arrested by Turkish police. Zeytinburnu became the site of over 50 police sweeps against \"East Turkistanis\" (Uyghurs), Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Uzbeks. Zeytinburnu is infamous for being used by Syria destined jihadists as a transit point. A Uyghur committed the nightclub attack according to Turkish news. Turkish news said he was from ISIS's \"East Turkestan\" arm. Erdoğan's government has deliberately facilitated the travel of Jihadist Uyghurs through Zeytinburnu, with Turkish intelligence involved and the nightclub massacre at Reina is a result of this.

{"id": "1810104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810104", "title": "Fatih", "text": "Fatih\n\nFatih, historically Constantinople, is the capital district and a municipality (\"belediye\") in Istanbul, Turkey, which hosts all the provincial authorities, including the governor's office, police headquarters, metropolitan municipality and tax office while encompassing the peninsula coinciding with old Constantinople. In 2009, the district of Eminönü, which had been a separate municipality located at the tip of the peninsula, was once again remerged into Fatih because of the small population of Eminönü. Fatih is bordered by the Golden Horn to the north and the Sea of Marmara to the south, while the Western border is demarked by the Theodosian wall and the east by the Bosphorus Strait.\n\nHistoric Byzantine districts encompassed by present-day Fatih include: \"Exokiónion\", \"Aurelianae\", \"Xerólophos\", \"ta Eleuthérou\", \"Helenianae\", \"ta Dalmatoú\", \"Sígma\", \"Psamátheia\", \"ta Katakalón\", \"Paradeísion\", \"ta Olympíou\", \"ta Kýrou\", \"Peghé\", \"Rhéghion\", \"ta Elebíchou\", \"Leomákellon\", \"ta Dexiokrátous\", \"Petríon\" or \"Pétra\", \"Phanàrion\", \"Exi Mármara\" (Altımermer), \"Philopátion\", \"Deúteron\" and \"Vlachernaí\".\n\nThe name \"Fatih\" comes from the Ottoman emperor Fatih Sultan Mehmed (Mehmed the Conqueror), and means \"Conqueror\" in Turkish, originally from Arabic. The Fatih Mosque built by Mehmed II is in this district, while his resting place is next to the mosque and is much visited. It was on the ruins of the Church of the Holy Apostles, destroyed by earthquakes and years of war, that the Fatih Mosque was built, and around the mosque a large prayer school.\n\nImmediately after the conquest, groups of Islamic scholars transformed the major churches of Hagia Sophia and the Pantocrator (today the Zeyrek Mosque) into mosques, but the Fatih Mosque and its surrounding complex was the first purpose-built Islamic seminary within the city walls. The building of the mosque complex ensured that the area continued to thrive beyond the conquest; markets grew up to support the thousands of workers involved in the building and to supply them with materials, and then to service the students in the seminary. The area quickly became a Turkish neighbourhood with a particularly pious character due to the seminary. Some of this piety has endured until today.\n\nFollowing the conquest, the Edirnekapı (meaning \"Edirne Gate\") gate in the city walls became the major exit to Thrace, and this rejuvenated the neighbourhoods overlooking the Golden Horn. The Fatih Mosque was on the road to Edirnekapı and the Fatih district became the most populous area of the city in the early Ottoman period and in the 16th century more mosques and markets were built in this area, including: Iskender Pasha Mosque, once famous as a centre for the Naqshbandi order in Turkey); Hirka-i-Sharif Mosque, which houses the cloak of the Prophet Muhammad (The Mosque is in common use but the cloak is only on show during the month of Ramadan; the Jerrahi Tekke; The Sunbul Efendi Tekke and the Ramazan Efendi Tekke both in the Kocamustafapaşa district and the Vefa Kilise Mosque, originally a Byzantine church. The last four were named after the founders of various Sufi orders, and Sheikh Ebü’l Vefa in particular was of major importance in the city and was very fond of Fatih. Many other mosques, schools, baths, and fountains in the area were built by military leaders and officials in the Ottoman court.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, Istanbul started to grow outside the walls, and then began the transformation of Fatih into the heavily residential district, dominated by concrete apartment housing, that it remains today. This process was accelerated over the years by fires which destroyed whole neighbourhoods of wooden houses, and a major earthquake in 1766, which destroyed the Fatih Mosque and many of the surrounding buildings (subsequently rebuilt). Fires continued to ravage the old city, and the wide roads that run through the area today are a legacy of all that burning. There are few wooden buildings left in Fatih today, although right up until the 1960s, the area was covered with narrow streets of wooden buildings. Nowadays, the district is largely made up of narrow streets with tightly-packed 5- or 6-floor apartment buildings.\nAt present, Fatih contains areas including Aksaray, Fındıkzade, Çapa, and Vatan Caddesi that are more cosmopolitan than the conservative image which the district has in the eyes of many people. With Eminönü, which was again officially a part of the Fatih district until 1928, and with its historical Byzantine walls, conquered by Mehmed II, Fatih is the \"real\" Istanbul of the old times, before the recent enlargement of the city that began in the 19th century.\n\nThe area has become more and more crowded from the 1960s onwards, and a large portion of the middle-class residents have moved to the Anatolian side and other parts of the city. Fatih today is largely a working-class district, but being a previously wealthy area, it is well-resourced, with a more thoroughly established community than the newly built areas such as Bağcılar or Esenler to the west, which are almost entirely inhabited by post-1980s migrants who came to the city in desperate circumstances. Fatih was built with some degree of central planning by the municipality.\n\nIstanbul University which was founded in 1453 is in Fatih. In addition, since 1586, the Orthodox Christian Patriarchate of Constantinople has had its headquarters in the relatively modest Church of St. George in the Fener neighborhood of Fatih.\n\nFatih has many theatres, including the famous Reşat Nuri Sahnesi. The area is well-served with a number of schools, hospitals and public amenities in general. A number of Istanbul's longest-established hospitals are in Fatih, including the Istanbul University teaching hospitals of Çapa and Cerrahpaşa, the Haseki Public Hospital, the Samatya Public Hospital, and the Vakıf Gureba Public Hospital. A tramway runs from the docks at Sirkeci, through Sultanahmet, and finally to Aksaray, which is a part of Fatih.\nAlso, besides the headquarters, some main units of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, including the city's fire department, are based in Fatih.\n\nFatih has many historic and modern libraries, including the Edirnekapı Halk Kütüphanesi, Fener Rum Patrikhanesi Kütüphanesi (\"the Library of the Patriarchate\"), Hekimoğlu Ali Paşa Halk Kütüphanesi, İstanbul University Library, İstanbul University Cerrahpaşa Tıp Fakültesi Kütüphanesi, İstanbul Üniversitesi Kardiyoloji Ensitütüsü Kütüphanesi, İstanbul Üniversitesi Tıp Fakültesi Hulusi Behçet Kitaplığı, İstanbul Büyükşehir Belediyesi Kadın Eserleri Kütüphanesi, Millet Kütüphanesi, Mizah Kütüphanesi, Murat Molla Halk Kütüphanesi, Ragıppaşa Kütüphanesi, and Yusufpaşa Halk Kütüphanesi.\n\nOn the other hand, today Fatih is known as one of the most conservative but peaceful religious areas of Istanbul because of the religious residents of the Çarşamba quarter which is essentially a very minor part of this historical district. Çarşamba is famous with bearded men in heavy coats, the traditional baggy 'shalwar' trousers and Islamic turban; while women dressed in full black gowns are a common sight as this area is popular with members of the Naqshbandi Sufi order affiliated to a Sheikh. Conservative political parties always do well in this area.\n\nKüçükçekmece, Başakşehir, Bağcılar, Gaziosmanpaşa, Esenler, Bayrampaşa, Zeytinburnu, and Fatih are home to refugees of Syrian origin.\n\nThere are 57 neighbourhoods in Fatih as of 2017.\n\n\nToday, there are still remnants of the sea walls along the Golden Horn and along the Marmara shore, to give a sense of the shape of the old walled city. There are also a number of important architectural structures in the Fatih district, including the Valens Aqueduct across the Atatürk Bulvarı, the fortress on the city walls at Yedikule, the Byzantine Palace of the Porphyrogenitus, the Roman column of Marcian, the Fethiye Cami (the former Byzantine church of Christ Pammakaristos), the Kariye Camii (the former Byzantine church of the Chora), Gül Camii (another former Byzantine church), Fenari Isa Camisi (a complex of two Byzantine churches), the Greek Patriarchate with the Church of St. George in the Fener district, the Church of St. Stephen (\"The Iron Church\"), the Yavuz Selim Camii, the House-Museum of Dimitrie Cantemir, and the Fatih Mosque itself.\n\nThe tombs of some of the famous sultans, including Mehmed II 'the Conqueror' (Fatih Sultan Mehmed) and Selim I (Yavuz Sultan Selim) as well as other leading statesmen of the Ottoman Empire, including Gazi Osman Pasha are in Fatih. And has a great collection of different cuisines(Turkish,Syrian,Korean,Indian).\n\nFatih is twinned with:\n\n"}

{"id": "1810113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810113", "title": "Ringing rocks", "text": "Ringing rocks\n\nRinging rocks, also known as sonorous rocks or lithophonic rocks, are rocks that resonate like a bell when struck, such as the Musical Stones of Skiddaw in the English Lake District; the stones in Ringing Rocks Park, in Upper Black Eddy, Bucks County, Pennsylvania; the Ringing Rocks of Kiandra, New South Wales; and the Bell Rock Range of Western Australia. Ringing rocks are used in idiophonic musical instruments called lithophones.\n\nSeveral early scientists became interested in the ringing rocks; however, none were able to formulate a credible theory on the ringing ability of the rocks or the formation of the boulder fields.\n\nEdgar T. Wherry (1885–1982), mineralogist and botanist, became interested in the ringing rocks while teaching at Lehigh University. Wherry theorized that the ringing was due to the texture of the diabase rocks and that they were supported by other rocks. He identified the boulder fields as a type of felsenmeer.\nAt the 13th Annual meeting of the Bucks Historical Society in June 1900, Charles Laubach, a noted local geologist and naturalist, described the geology of the diabase \"trap\" sills with reference to sites such as Bridgeton, Stony Garden, and others.\n\nBenjamin Franklin Fackenthal (1851–1941), local industrialist and trustee of Franklin & Marshall College, became interested with the ringing rocks. Although not a professional geologist, Fackenthal made extensive observations on all of the boulder fields.\n\nIn 1965, geologist Richard Faas of Lafayette College took a few of the rocks back to his lab for testing. He found that when the rocks were struck, they created a series of tones at frequencies lower than the human ear can hear. An audible sound is only produced because these tones interact with each other. Although Faas's experiments explained the nature of the tones, they did not identify the specific physical mechanism in the rock which made them.\n\nAlthough there have been over a dozen diabase ringing rock boulder fields identified in the Pennsylvania/New Jersey area, the majority are either on private property or have been obliterated by urban development. There are three sites north of Philadelphia which are readily accessible to the public: Ringing Rocks County Park, Stony Garden, and Ringing Hill Park.\n\nRinging Rocks County Park is a Bucks County park in Upper Black Eddy. Originally, the land was acquired by the Penn family from the Lenape (Delaware Nation) through the infamous 1737 Walking Purchase. It is not clear who made the original land warrant for the area now covered by the Ringing Rocks County Park. On the 1850 property map of Bucks County, the owner appears to be Tunis Lippincott; however, there is no warrantee listing under that name. The earliest published description of the Bridgetown boulder field is found in Davis 1876. The seven-acre boulder field was purchased in 1895 by Abel B. Haring, president of the Union National Bank in Frenchtown, New Jersey. Apparently, Haring wished to protect the ringing rocks from development, and even refused an offer from a manufacturer of Belgian blocks for the right to quarry the stones. On August 22, 1918, the land which contains the Bridgeton Boulder Field was donated by Haring to the Bucks County Historical Society. The grant included 7 acres 8.08 perches of land. A right-of-way was granted by John O. McEntee for access to the park. Later, the land was transferred to Bucks County and operated as a county park. Additional land acquisitions have increased the size of the park to 129 acres.\n\nRinging Hill Park is located three miles northeast of Pottstown, Pennsylvania in Montgomery County. The boulder field was first identified in 1742 when a road was cut between Pottstown and New Gosenhoppen (Pennsburg). In 1894, the Ringing Rocks Electric Railway Company was incorporated to purchase the remote Ringing Hill for an amusement park and provide trolley service (1894 to 1932). At the time it was created, the park was approximately out of town. The park was purchased in 1932 by Walter J. Wolf and operated as an amusement park and skating rink. On September 1, 1957, the park was sold to the Ringing Hill Fire Company.\n\nThe Stony Garden, largest of the three public ringing rock boulder fields, is located on the northwest slope of Haycock Mountain in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, near Bucksville. The garden is actually a series of disconnected boulder fields which extend for nearly half a mile, and were formed where the olivine diabase unit crops out along the base of the mountain. The site is undeveloped, and is accessible by a hiking trail which leads from a PA Game Lands parking area on Stony Garden Road. It was purchased by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania around 1920 as part of PA Game Lands Tract #157, which covers Haycock Mountain.\n\nThe ringing rock boulder fields were popular places for meetings of the local Buckwampun Historical Society. Two annual meetings were held at the Bridgeton site (in 1893 and 1898), and one at Stony Garden (in 1890). The Bucks County Historical Society also had a meeting at the Bridgeton site in 1919, the year after they acquired the property.\n\nAt the third annual BHS meeting in June 1890 a local physician, John J. Ott of Pleasant Valley, gave a musical performance using boulders taken from the Stony Garden boulder field. The suggestion for the construction of the lithophone was made by the historian William J. Buck. The rocks weighed approximately apiece, and apparently Ott was able to change their sound by slightly chipping the boulders. He played several selections using a steel hammer and accompanied by a brass band. \"The clear, bell-like tones of the rocks could be heard above the notes of the horns.\" The tunes included \"Home Sweet Home\" and a composition of his own entitled \"Sounds from the Ringing Rocks\" – possibly a takeoff from the 1873 piano music score of the same name.\n\nThese boulder field in southeastern Pennsylvania and central New Jersey formed from a group of diabase sills in Newark Basin. The sills were formed when stretching of the Earth's crust allowed mafic magma to travel up from the upper mantle inject into the sedimentary basin 200 million years ago (early Jurassic Period). Phenocrysts of two minerals that had crystallized in the upper mantle, olivine and pyroxene, quickly settled out of the magma and collected along the base of the sills. When fully solidified, this crystal-rich layer formed a separate rock unit thick. By the Pleistocene Epoch, the sills had been exposed to the surface by crustal uplift and erosion. During the Pleistocene, outcrops of the olivine diabase were not buried by the glacial sheets; however, they were subjected to severe freezing, or periglacial, conditions. The periglacial environment caused the outcrops to be broken into extensive boulder fields.\n\nThe basal olivine unit is similar to the one found in the Palisades Sill in New Jersey and New York. The olivine diabase unit is significantly harder, denser, and more resistant to weathering than the upper portions of the diabase sill.\n\nMost observers did not make the distinction between the upper \"normal\". diabase which is found over wide areas, and the thin olivine diabase unit found at the base of the sills which actually produces the ringing rock boulder fields. A main factor in the confusion is the outward appearance of the rocks. Both the normal and olivine diabase rocks are dark grey to black in color. Microscopic examination is often required to identify the differences.\n\nAlthough the Newark series diabase sills crop out in a belt throughout the length of the Appalachian Mountains, only a narrow band of outcrops in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey develop ringing rock boulder fields. The probable reason is that these areas were at the southern edge of the Pleistocene glaciers, and would have been subject to extreme periglacial conditions. Periglacial boulder fields are a common feature in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nAll of the observed ringing rock boulder fields in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey are a form of felsenmeer (\"felsenmeer\" is a German term meaning \"sea of rock\"). These barren block fields occur in periglacial environments where outcrops of resistant rock are exposed with a slope of less than 25°. Frost wedging breaks up the upper portion of the rock formation, and the slight dip of the field allows the fine weathering materials to be flushed away before soil can develop. Often, the boulders are lifted and rotated by the accumulation of snow and ice, leaving a considerable amount of vacant space between them. The felsenmeer boulder fields form in-situ due to the low-slope angles. In situations where the slope angles are steeper than 25°, gravity tends to move the boulders downhill to form scree or talus slopes. In fields where the angle is too flat, the spaces between the boulders fills with soil and the boulders break down due to weathering.\n\nBecause the olivine diabase unit is relatively thin there was an additional requirement for the formation of the ringing rock boulder fields: the olivine diabase unit had to be dipping in the same direction as the slope of the ground surface. This specific dip-slope situation allowed broad expanses of olivine diabase to be exposed and provided enough material to create the fields. In all of the observed boulder fields the structural dip of the unit was approximately 8-10°, and the ground surface slope was <15° in the same direction. Typically this occurred where the olivine diabase unit dipped at right angles into a shallow drainage. Where the olivine diabase does not dip in the same direction as the ground surface there is generally numerous boulders embedded in the soil (boulder colluvium), but no boulder fields.\n\nThere has been a great deal of controversy concerning the ringing ability of the boulders; conversely, there has been an almost complete lack of testing to support the conjectures. Conditions such as size and shape of the boulders and the way that the boulders are supported or stacked certainly influence the sounds that the boulders make but do not in themselves impart the ringing ability.\n\nAlthough the sound is often described as metallic, it is most likely due to a combination of the density of the rock and a high degree of internal stress. The sound can be duplicated on a small scale by tapping the handle of a ceramic coffee cup.\n\nThe iron content of the diabase is often identified as the source of the ringing ability. Actual chemical analysis of the Coffman Hill diabase shows that iron content (as ferric oxide) of the rock ranges from 9% and 12%. Although comparatively high for an average igneous rock (3% is typical for granite), it is within the normal range for a basalt. This point suggests that the iron content is not a primary factor in the ringing ability.\n\nSo far, there has been only one published scientific experiment on the source of the ringing ability. In the 1960s, a Rutgers University professor did an informal experiment where specimens of \"live\" and \"dead\" ringing rock boulders from the Bucks County park site were sawed into thin slices and then measured for changes in shape. The rock slices were measured with delicate foil strain gauges, which could measure minute changes in size. According to the professor, the dead rocks showed no change after the rocks were sawed; however, the live rocks showed a distinctive expansion or \"relaxation\" within 24 hours of being cut. This relaxation indicates that the rock was under internal elastic stresses that were released by the mechanical sawing of the rock. The professor went on to make the observation that the live rocks were generally found toward the middle of the boulder fields, where they did not come in contact with soil and the shade of the surrounding trees. He then theorized that the slow weathering rate in the dry \"microclimate\" of the fields caused the stresses, because the outside skin of the boulders would expand owing to the conversion of pyroxene to montmorillonite (a clay mineral). Boulders along the periphery of the fields weather too quickly and break apart before the stresses can develop.\n\nAlthough more rigorous testing needs to be done to verify these results, it does suggest strongly that the ringing ability is a direct result of internal stresses. Less likely is the assertion that outside weathering conditions created the stresses. It is very improbable that the expansion of a thin skin around the outside of a large boulder could set up a balance of forces that would create the severe stresses found in the ringing rock boulders. The result of such a situation would be that the outside skin of the boulders would peel or exfoliate, a condition that is virtually non-existent in any of the ringing rocks sites. In addition, the majority of the weathering in the boulders occurs at the exposed top surfaces, not on the bottoms; thus, the stresses would not be balanced. Furthermore, if slow weathering created the stresses, then there would be ringing rock boulder fields in deserts throughout the world, a condition which does not occur.\n\nAn important point made in the experiment is the observation that the rock slices \"expanded\" when the stress was released. This distinction requires that the rock was under extreme compressive stress, not tension as the slow weathering theory implies.\n\nA more plausible theory is that the elastic stresses remained in the rock when the boulder fields formed, and the slow weathering rate keeps the stresses from dissipating. A possible source of the stresses would likely be the loading stresses from the time when the rock crystallized. The diabase sill formed at roughly beneath the surface. The overlying column of rock creates severe stresses in rocks. The effects of these stresses can be seen in deep mines with a depth of over a mile, where the sudden decompression creates rock bursts. Residual loading stresses would be evenly distributed throughout the boulders. This theory supports the observation that usually less than a third of the boulders in any given field are \"live\". The stresses are relieved in boulders that have been either mechanically broken or are severely weathered, and therefore no longer ring.\n\nThis \"relict stress\" theory implies that the ringing rock boulders act much like a guitar string. When a guitar string is limp it does not resonate, but a plucked string will provide a range of sounds depending on the level of applied tension. Likewise, a ringing rock boulder will only emit a dull thud if the boulder is de-stressed; however, boulders will resonate at various frequencies depending on the level of residual stress.\n\nThe boulders continue to ring when removed from the boulder fields. Myths have been developed by authorities to discourage the theft of boulders from the fields. At the current stage, however, most fields have been picked clean of small portable \"ringers\", and breaking of large boulders into smaller pieces releases the internal stresses—thus causing them to stop ringing (i.e., breaking a piece off of a large ringing rock will only gain a dead chunk of rock). \"Small\" ringers found today weigh over a ton and would have to be dragged out of the boulder fields using large equipment.\n\nOften, the weathering textures in boulders take on the form of channels, grooves, \"potholes\", \"mudcracks\", and intense pitting. In some cases, the textures are so distinctive that some geologists refer to them in terms of carbonate rock solution features. Inspection of the boulders reveals that the weathering patterns are not due to any internal variations in the rock, but have been superimposed onto the surfaces. The probable source of these textures was chemical weathering along joint surfaces when the rock was still in place and before the boulders were broken out by frost heaving. The soft weathered portion of the outer surfaces flaked off once the boulders were exposed to the air. Small features on the boulder surfaces became exaggerated as the weathered material was removed, so that adjoining fissures became channels, dents became 'potholes', and old surfaces became intensely pitted.\n\nThe Ringing Rocks Pluton is located in the mountains of southwest Montana between Butte and Whitehall, and is notable for a large tor of ringing boulders. The pluton is the deep-seated vent for a volcano which erupted 76 million years ago. The pluton is that it is an example of magma mixing in a conduit, specifically between olivine basalt and granitic magmas. Mixing of the magmas created a hybrid rock type which crystallized against the outer wall of conduit. After millions of years of uplift and erosion, the thin walls of hybrid rock were exposed to the surface. During the Pleistocene Epoch, periglacial freezing shattered the high standing walls to form a substantial tor.\n\nThe Ringing Rocks Pluton is located on the southwestern flank of Dry Mountain in Jefferson County, 15 miles southeast of Butte in T.2 N., R.5 W., sections 4 and 9. Section 4 is included in the Deerlodge National Forest, and section 9 is under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. A distinctive tor is marked on the U.S. Geological Survey Dry Mountain 7½' quadrangle. The NW¼ of Section 9, which includes the tor, was established as the Ringing Rocks Recreation Area by the USBLM in 1964. Access is by a gravel road leading 3 miles north of the Pipestone exit off I-90.\n\nThe Ringing Rocks Pluton is a small-scale intrusive ring complex with a high degree of symmetry. The overall geometry is cylindrical, with an average diameter of one kilometer. The pluton consists of two major units: an inner core of quartz-bearing felsic units with a diameter of 600 meters and an outer mafic unit composed of coaxial concentric layers. In map view, the complex has a bulls-eye configuration. The outer zone of the pluton consists of two alternating mafic hybrid rock types. In chemical analysis the rocks are nearly identical; however, the early stage minerals, olivine and pyroxene, were preserved in one and not the other, giving the rocks sharply different weathering properties. The rock that retained the olivine and pyroxene crystals (OPM) is extremely resistant to weathering and is the material which forms the tors. The altered rock (AM) conversely is very weak and readily breaks down to a coarse soil. The inner felsic core is a medium grained quartz monzonite that gradually grades into granite at the center. The transitional unit between the mafic zone and the felsic core units is completely obscured, and is represented by distinctive low-lying swales. A series of radial dikes punctured the mafic units, beginning in the felsic zone and terminating at the outer border of the intrusion. The dikes are generally 2–4 meters wide where they are in contact with the felsic unit. The composition is highly variable, but for the most part is composed of fine to medium-grained leucocratic monzonite. The dikes become narrower as they extend toward the outer border, and generally taper to less than 0.5 m in width.\n\nThere are numerous textures in the hybrid OPM unit which indicate that the rock was rapidly quenched during crystallization.\n\nCrystals of cryptoperthetic orthoclase up to 1 cm in length can be seen in hand specimens throughout most of the OPM units. The cryptoperthite crystals typically show as deep blue flashes, although white and yellow flashes can be seen in rocks nearer to the contacts. The flashes are due to labradorescent internal reflections, sometimes called a moonstone effect. In early reports this mineral was mistakenly identified as labradorite. Cryptoperthite textures form when orthoclase (a feldspar mineral containing both potassium and sodium cations) is quenched very rapidly. Sodium has a much larger ionic radius than potassium does, so during the quench event the sodium ions pop out of the crystal framework. These sodium ions form tiny oriented lenses of albite (sodium silicate feldspar) that are too small to be seen even using a microscope. It is the reflections from these albite laminae that produces the flash.\n\nApatite occurs as elongated needles. Many of the needles enclose narrow fluid inclusions, giving the crystals the appearance of being \"hollow\".\n\nZircon crystals were identified in skeletal frameworks.\n\nThe Ringing Rocks Pluton is one of several bimodal vent complexes that are located within a 20 km belt east of the main Butte Pluton. Radiometric dating and cross-cutting relationships place most of these intrusions as post-Elkhorn Mountains Volcanics and pre-Butte Pluton. Similar intrusions can be found in the Rader Creek Pluton.\n\nThe pile of loose boulders at the south end of the pluton which contains the ringing rocks is called a tor. The reason the tor developed is that the OPM units are extremely resistant to weathering, and conversely the adjoining AM and ABM units are very weak. As the Dry Creek drainage began to erode the NW corner of the pluton, the softer AM and ABM units were quickly stripped away, leaving vertical thin walls of OPM units standing high above the surrounding landscape. Intense freezing and thawing during the Pleistocene periglacial period slowly shattered the walls, much like breaking tempered glass. The remnants of the OPM walls is the material which formed the tor. At the north end of the pluton the orientation of the OPM units was at an acute angle to the Dry Creek drainage so that the tor there did not develop very well.

These characteristics include being composed of igneous mafic rock types with high percentages of olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts, having the individual boulders isolated from severe weathering by the formation of well-drained boulder fields, and having similar sounds and surface weathering.\n\nThe iron content of the olivine pyroxene monzonite (as ferrous oxide) is 7% of the whole rock. As in the Pennsylvania diabase ringing rocks, this point suggests that iron content is not a primary factor in the ringing ability.\n\nDespite the broad public interest in the ringing ability of the ringing rocks, there has not been any actual scientific studies to identify the source of the phenomenon.\n\nBoulders of the olivine pyroxene monzonite develop odd surface weathering patterns, similar to the textures seen in the Pennsylvania diabase ringing rocks. These textures include channels, grooves, and \"potholes\".\n\nThe Bell Rock Range is a large ultramafic gabbro-peridotite intrusion in the Musgrave Block of Western Australia, near Warburton, south of the Wingellina community in the Ngaanyatjarra lands. It is composed of massive, heavily indurated intrusive rocks and forms a prominent long range of mountains and hills. The Bell Rock Range is also the site of an exploratory gold mine.\n\n\n\nFor § Ringing Rocks Pluton, Montana:\n\n\n"}

He also starred in the Country Music Television television documentary \"\".\n\nLeland Blane Chapman was born as son of Duane Chapman Sr. and his first wife, La Fonda Sue Darnall (née Honeycutt).\n\nChapman spent his early years in Pampa, Texas, but during his teen years, moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. As a teenager Chapman ran away from home, began skipping school, and joined a gang. Unable to handle him any longer, his mother put him in foster care, athough he ran away and he was placed in a boys care home at 13. He was given the choice to go back into foster care or go live with his father and he chose to live with his father. \n\nAt seventeen, Chapman began training in boxing and mixed martial arts with the help of his good friend Sonny Westbrook (who has appeared many times on \"Dog the Bounty Hunter\"). Leland graduated high school when he was 18.\n\nChapman started out working for his father at their family's bail bonds company, Da Kine Bail Bonds. Other family members working for the company include Beth Chapman, Duane Lee Chapman, Leland, and \"Baby\" Lyssa Chapman (Dog's daughter/Leland's half-sister), among others.\nOn September 14, 2006, Leland Chapman was arrested along with Duane \"Dog\" Chapman and Tim Chapman by U.S. Marshals at the request of the Mexican government and was to be extradited to Mexico to face charges of \"deprivation of liberty\". The charges stem from an incident in which they were chasing fugitive and serial rapist Andrew Luster, the Max Factor Cosmetics heir. They captured Luster on June 18, 2003 in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Shortly after the capture, the three were themselves arrested by Puerto Vallarta police officers; the three posted bail but never returned to Mexico for their court hearing on July 15, 2003. They were released from custody on bail; Leland and Tim Chapman's bail was set at $100,000 each, while Dog's was set at $300,000. They faced an extradition hearing to Mexico, under the terms of treaties between the United States and Mexico. On the August 4, 2007 episode of \"Larry King Live\", it was announced that the Mexican government had dropped the charges filed against the three bounty hunters.\n\nChapman, along with his brothers, Duane Lee and Wesley Chapman, formed Chapbros Media. The company launched an iPhone, iPod Touch and website talent contest application called, \"Show Off\". The company is no longer in business (blog has not been updated since 2009).\n\nThe March 21, 2012 episode depicted Duane Lee telling Beth, \"You want me fired, you gotta fire me,\" after which Chapman stated that he was quitting too. In 2012, the two brothers publicly stated that they left the show. In a tweet from Beth she wrote, \"It will take 6 weeks to get thru the whole thing tonight's jus [sic] the beginning\".\n\nSince leaving the show Leland Chapman operates his own bail bond company, Kama'aina Bail Bonds on the Big Island of Hawaii and runs his father's business, Da Kine Bail Bonds in Oahu. He previously headed Bounty Hunter Tactical Supply Co. after Duane Lee moved to Florida.\n\nIn April 2013, Duane \"Dog\" Chapman's new television show, \"Dog and Beth: On the Hunt\", debuted on CMT. The show features Dog, Beth, and Leland traveling across the country giving bail bondsmen business advice and assisting them with bounties. The pilot episode featured Chapman and Dog working together for the first time since the split in 2012.\n\nLeland moved from Hawaii to Alabama in 2015. He resides with wife, Jamie P. Chapman whom he married in 2016 and is still working as a bail agent.\n\n"}

He wrote the stories \"The Visitation\" (1982), \"Earthshock\" (1982), \"Resurrection of the Daleks\" (1984) and \"Revelation of the Daleks\" (1985).\n\nHis career as a scriptwriter began with drama for radio while he was working as a teacher. Later he was able to cross into full-time writing. He was approached by then \"Doctor Who\" script editor Christopher H. Bidmead to submit some ideas to the series on the strength of a recommendation from the senior drama script editor at BBC Radio. He received a commission to write the story \"The Visitation\". This in turn led to his appointment as script editor on the recommendation of Antony Root, who had briefly replaced Bidmead. In addition to his role as script editor, Saward also wrote the television stories \"Earthshock\", \"Resurrection of the Daleks\" and \"Revelation of the Daleks\".\n\nHe has said in interviews that he also performed uncredited writing duties, over and above that normally expected of a script editor, on \"The Awakening,\" \"The Twin Dilemma\", \"Attack of the Cybermen\" and \"The Trial of a Time Lord,\" amongst others. Not all of these claims have been substantiated by other sources.\n\nSaward's other \"Who\" writings include the 1983 short story \"Birth of a Renegade\" in the special magazine published by \"Radio Times\" at the time of \"The Five Doctors\" (1983), the 20th Anniversary Special' (and Starlog Press in the United States) and the 1985 radio play \"Slipback\" which was broadcast on Radio 4. He wrote the novelisations of \"The Twin Dilemma\" and \"Attack of the Cybermen\", as well as those of \"The Visitation\" and \"Slipback\", for Target Books' \"Doctor Who\" range. His two Dalek stories were for a long time the only stories from the classic Doctor Who series (from 1963 - 1989, 1996) never novelized; Saward eventually wrote novelisations of both stories in 2019. \"Earthshock\" was novelised by Ian Marter.\n\nSaward aroused controversy in 1985 because many of the stories of Colin Baker's first season in the role contained numerous scenes of graphic violence and darker themes, which many commentators felt was inappropriate for a programme aimed at a family audience (the season featured acid baths, hangings, cell mutation experiments, executions by laser, cannibalism, poisonings, stabbings, suffocation by cyanide and a man having his hands crushed). Unlike the criticism of violence levelled against the series by Mary Whitehouse during the Philip Hinchcliffe era, disapproval this time came from members of the general public and some \"Doctor Who\" fans, as well as Whitehouse. BBC 1 controller Michael Grade publicly criticised the violence featured in Colin Baker's first season and gave it as one of his reasons for putting the series on an 18-month hiatus from 1985 until 1986. Saward defended these scenes, saying they were intended to be dramatic and to warn audiences against real-world violence.\n\nSaward had a sometimes strained relationship with \"Doctor Who\" producer John Nathan-Turner, which gave rise to occasional tensions behind the scenes. When asked in July 1988 \"If you could go back and start again, what would you change?\" he replied. \"The producer\" \n\nSaward often objected to Nathan-Turner's insistence on hiring novice \"Doctor Who\" writers, which led to Saward having to work hard, not always successfully, on unsuitable scripts submitted by inexperienced contributors. Saward was eventually able to bring veteran writer Robert Holmes back to the series and they became friends before his death. Unfortunately, his working relationship with Nathan-Turner deteriorated further. He had disagreed with Nathan-Turner's casting of Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor and, following the 1985 hiatus, problems peaked during the production of \"The Trial of a Time Lord\" in the middle of 1986 when he resigned as script editor before the completion of production. Nevertheless, Saward's association with the show continued and in the 1990s he wrote linking narration for \"Doctor Who\" audio releases of missing episodes. More recently he has appeared in interviews on DVDs of his serials. He also contributed a short story to the Big Finish \"Short Trips\" collection. Saward has not worked in British television since leaving \"Doctor Who\" but he has written for German radio drama.\n\nSaward lived in the Netherlands for three years, where he was briefly married. He also had a relationship with fellow writer Paula Woolsey for a number of years, who was credited (as Paula Moore) with writing the \"Doctor Who\" serial \"Attack of the Cybermen\" (1985). He has two daughters, Natasha and Marielle.\n\n"}

It gained the villages of Ömerli, Koçullu, Sırapınar and Hüseyinli from Beykoz in the same year. Finally, Nişantepe quarter passed from Samandıra, where bound to Kartal, to Alemdar, where bound to Ümraniye in 2002. It is bordered by Şile to the northeast, Kartal to the southeast, Kadıköy to the south, Üsküdar to the west and Beykoz to the northwest.\n\nÜmraniye is located on high ground just inland from Üsküdar. It began as a small village of under 900 people mainly immigrated from Black Sea Region, but in the early 1950s. Its population grew far beyond its capacity during the 1970s and 1980s due to migration to the cities from rural areas of Anatolia.\n\nThe growth of Ümraniye was better controlled than other districts that also attracted workers on the European side (such as Esenler or Gaziosmanpaşa); there are better, wider roads through the district, more space between the blocks and more green space in general. And better amenities, a large commercial district grew up to support this large population, the main road through the centre has shiny public buildings, big shops, shopping centres, branches of all the banks etc. And Ümraniye has high schools, a courthouse, cultural amenities such as cinema and all the other infrastructure of an urban area. And the traffic of course. Although it used to be a little village,Ümraniye now gives high class opportunities to its elites.\n\nÜmraniye became famous after an arms cache allegedly belonging to conspiratorial Ergenekon network was discovered here in 2007.\n\nWith its natural landscape and urban design, Ümraniye was chosen as the cleanest district of Istanbul by ISTAC.\nRecently there has been a great deal of change in Ümraniye. Large shopping malls and entertainment centers have opened everywhere. Many housing projects have been developed in Umraniye to address the needs of all classes. Ümraniye is one of the fastest growing areas in Istanbul.\n\nIn the last few decades, Ümraniye has built a lively shopping and business district. Numerous international businesses are now based in Umraniye, which attract young, well-educated people from all over Turkey. At Ümraniye, you can find 34 kindergarten, 61 primary School and 9 high schools, as well as 22 sport-centers, and 29 hospitals and clinics. There are numerous athletic and cultural activities in Umraniye at 40 parks, 3 movie theaters and 3 theaters.\n\nRecent building projects include the construction of large shopping malls (including Istanbul's first branch of IKEA), and modern apartments complexes have made parts of Ümraniye attractive places for people to buy real estate, especially as Ümraniye is on a main highway that leads to one of the two bridges linking the Asian and European sides of Istanbul. A car ride from Ümraniye to Mecidiyeköy, a business center on the European side of the city, may only take around 20 minutes in good traffic. Ümraniye also provides easy access to Üsküdar, Kadıköy and Ataşehir, the business capital of the Asian side of Istanbul.\n\nÜmraniye has seen its fair share of political violence between left- and right-wingers over the years, and during the 70s and 80s law enforcement was problematic in parts of the area. In this way it was considered the Asian side's equivalent of Gaziosmanpaşa on the European side. This violence was concentrated in a small quarter of Ümraniye, a vast district. In recent times however, Ümraniye has been relatively calm, and the most dangerous crimes in the area are those typical of urban areas, such as pick-pocketing or theft and those political crime involved districts are now in limits of Ataşehir.\n\nThe people of Ümraniye usually vote in large numbers for conservative parties. The AK Party does well in this district.\n\nIn between Üsküdar and Ümraniye there is a 'çilehane' of the Sufi saint Aziz Mahmud Hudayi. A çilehane (cheelay-hahnay, lit. 'despair house') was where Sufis would go to pray in seclusion.\n\nThe Haldun Alagaş Sports Hall is located here, which is named after the multiple world and European champion of Karate. The venue hosts both national and international basketball, volleyball, handball games and martial art competitions.\n\nThere is a newly made forestress where people can have walk and picnic.\nIn some parts of Ümraniye, the full scene of Istanbul, including Bosphorus and European Side, can be seen easily.\nAlso,Çamlıca hill is very close.\n\n"}

It depicts the objects and classes involved in the scenario and the sequence of messages exchanged between the objects needed to carry out the functionality of the scenario. Sequence diagrams are typically associated with use case realizations in the Logical View of the system under development. Sequence diagrams are sometimes called event diagrams or event scenarios.\n\nA sequence diagram shows, as parallel vertical lines (\"lifelines\"), different processes or objects that live simultaneously, and, as horizontal arrows, the messages exchanged between them, in the order in which they occur. This allows the specification of simple runtime scenarios in a graphical manner.\n\nIf the lifeline is that of an object, it demonstrates a role. Leaving the instance name blank can represent anonymous and unnamed instances.\n\nMessages, written with horizontal arrows with the message name written above them, display interaction. Solid arrow heads represent synchronous calls, open arrow heads represent asynchronous messages, and dashed lines represent reply messages.\nIf a caller sends a synchronous message, it must wait until the message is done, such as invoking a subroutine. If a caller sends an asynchronous message, it can continue processing and doesn’t have to wait for a response. Asynchronous calls are present in multithreaded applications, event-driven applications and in message-oriented middleware. \nActivation boxes, or method-call boxes, are opaque rectangles drawn on top of lifelines to represent that processes are being performed in response to the message (ExecutionSpecifications in UML).\n\nObjects calling methods on themselves use messages and add new activation boxes on top of any others to indicate a further level of processing. If an object is destroyed (removed from memory), an X is drawn on bottom of the lifeline, and the dashed line ceases to be drawn below it. It should be the result of a message, either from the object itself, or another.\n\nA message sent from outside the diagram can be represented by a message originating from a filled-in circle (\"found message\" in UML) or from a border of the sequence diagram (\"gate\" in UML).\n\nUML has introduced significant improvements to the capabilities of sequence diagrams. Most of these improvements are based on the idea of \"interaction fragments\" which represent smaller pieces of an enclosing interaction. Multiple interaction fragments are combined to create a variety of \"combined fragments\", which are then used to model interactions that include parallelism, conditional branches, optional interactions.\n\n"}

The Cerro de los Ángeles (\"Hill of the Angels\"), a site traditionally considered to be the geographical center of the Iberian Peninsula, also lies within the municipal limits. Getafe is located 13 km south of Madrid's city centre, within a flat area of Spain's Meseta Central in the Manzanares River basin.\n\nGetafe's proximity to central Madrid fostered industrial development during the 20th and 21st centuries. The city's industrialisation in turn led to an increase in population, reaching 170,115 in 2011. Due to its industrial and social networks, the majority of residents work or study within the city. Getafe hosts an Airbus factory. The increase in population led to the construction of numerous access roads, an increase in available public services, and the creation of new neighborhoods at the end of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, a number of villages were located in the present-day area of Getafe. One of the main villages was Alarnes, which was very close to the current urban center. In 1326, the villagers united themselves into one town, situated on the royal road that linked Madrid with Toledo. This new town was called \"Xatafi,\" a name which came from the Arab word \"jata\" (\"something long\"). It is assumed that the name \"Xatafi\" referred to the royal road, which also served as the town's main street. The town's name evolved over time, from \"Xetafe\" to \"Jetafee\" to \"Jetaphe\" to \"Jetafe\" to \"Getafe.\"\n\nThe history of Getafe can be split into three clearly defined eras. In the first era, which lasted from Prehistory until 1326, there existed distinct villages in the area, though Getafe itself did not exist as a municipality. The second era lasted from the 14th century until the 20th century, during which Getafe was established as a town and developed slowly. In the third era, which began in the 20th century and continues to the present day, Getafe changed in nature from a small agricultural town to a large industrial city, with a noticeable increase in commerce, industry, population and size.\n\nThe presence of humans in the area of Getafe dates back to the Lower Paleolithic period (before 100,000 BCE). Various stone tools, pots, and bracelets from this period have been excavated from the banks of the Manzanares River.\n\nThe Romans dominated the Iberian Peninsula from the 2nd century BCE until the 5th century AD. In the 3rd century AD, the Romans constructed a villa called La Torecilla, whose ruins are still visible on the banks of the Manzanares River. The area was subsequently overrun by a series of Germanic tribes, including Suebi, Vandals and Visigoths, and the Indoeuropean Alans.\n\nThe area currently encompassed by the Getafe municipal district was invaded by the Moors in the 8th century. King Alfonso VI conquered the villages of the area in 1085. In 1326, the inhabitants of the villages moved closer to the royal road connecting Madrid and Toledo, in effect creating a new town, Getafe. In that same century, the primitive hermitage of La Magdalena was built, only to be destroyed several centuries later.\n\nIn 1492, famine and disease devastated Getafe, prompting the construction of the Hospitalillo de San José in 1529. In 1549, the architect Alonso de Covarrubias began building the Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Magdalena, which has since become the Cathedral of the Diocese of Getafe. The church was built on the foundation of the old hermitage, and in 1610 a new hermitage was built on the Cerro de los Ángeles. The college of the Escuelas Pías was founded in 1737. In 1763, King Charles III ordered the construction of a new road connecting Madrid to Aranjuez and, further on, to Cádiz, which passed along the foot of the Cerro de los Ángeles. Napoleonic troops occupied Getafe from 1808 to 1812. A train line connecting Madrid to Aranjuez, and passing through Getafe, was inaugurated in 1851.\n\nElectric street lights were lit for the first time in Getafe on 22 December 1897. The Getafe Air Force Base was permanently established in 1911, followed by the School of Civil Aviation two years later. King Alfonso XIII inaugurated the first monument to the Sacred Heart of Jesus on the Cerro de los Ángeles on 30 May 1919. In 1924, Construcciones Aeronáuticas S.A. built its first factory in the area. That same year, Juan de la Cierva's autogyro was flown for the first time from the air force base.\n\nDue to its proximity to Madrid, Getafe underwent an industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century, resulting in the city's conversion from agricultural city to industrial city. Industrialization also prompted a rapid boom in population, starting in the 1950s. In 1956, John Deere established a factory in Getafe, and a year later, Siemens AG followed suit. The city was forced to create the neighborhoods of San Isidro, El Bercial, Juan de la Cierva, and Las Margaritas in the 1970s in order to support these new industries.\n\nIn 1961, the Canal de Isabel II began to provide water to Getafe. The first local democratic elections occurred in 1979, after the ratification of the Constitution in 1978. In 1989, the Universidad Carlos III was founded. The Sector III neighbourhood was constructed between 1979 and 1988; the Getafe Norte neighbourhood was built during the late 1990s; the El Bercial neighbourhood is currently being expanded. In April 2003, Madrid Metro System's Line 12 opened, linking the Madrid region's southern population centres with the capital.\n\nThe coat of arms of Getafe is divided vertically into two equal halves that represent the two most important characteristics of the municipal district. The left half contains a heart in the center of a Latin cross, representing the Sacred Heart of Jesus—a reference to the Cerro de los Ángeles. The right half contains a repeated pattern of airplanes representing the aeronautical tradition of the area and referencing the nearby Air Force Base. The Royal Spanish Crown tops the coat of arms, and symbolizes Getafe's loyalty to the Spanish monarchy.\n\nThe current mayor of Getafe is Sara Hernández Barroso, socialist, thanks to the support of left wing group United Left (IU) and a political platform close to Podemos called 'Ahora Getafe'. In 2011, Juan Soler-Espiauba Gallo, of the People's Party (PP), was elected mayor and displaced the incumbent, a socialist, who had held this post since 1983. The most popular political parties in the area, other than the PSOE, are the Peoples' Party (PP) and the United Left (IU). Getafe has always had a large working population, and left-wing groups, especially the PSOE, have traditionally been very influential.\n\nIn the 2007 Spanish regional elections, the PSOE elected 13 town councillors (44.18% of the vote), PP, 11 (36.09%), and IU 3, (11.73%). Other political associations were not able to muster enough votes to receive representation. Local elections occur every four years, along with the autonomous election. \n\nIn the last Spanish General elections celebrated in 2015, PP obtained 25,65% of the vote, very close to Podemos (24,72%) and PSOE (22,60%). Ciudadanos obtained 16,54% of the vote and IU 7,07%.\n\nCabinet meetings are composed of nine councillors: eight from the PSOE and one from IU. The Municipal Corporation is made up of 27 members, detailed previously. The cabinet is presided over by the mayor. The Getafe city council is divided into a number of different focus groups: treasury, wealth, and social security; equality; urbanism; civil action; and management of waste disposal, cleanliness, the environment, and the home. The council holds sessions every month, in addition to frequently held special sessions, in which councillors debate various topics and problems which affect the municipality.\n\nGetafe is at the forefront of the struggle for workers rights in local industry. The most important trade unions in the city are the Workers' Commissions (CCOO) and the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT). Both unions have branch offices in Getafe and list many local workers as members.\n\nGetafe is located in the southern zone of the autonomous community of Madrid, Spain, in southwestern Europe. It is physically located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula, north of the Southern Submeseta (part of the Meseta Central), in the Manzanares River basin. Its elevation is 610 – 640 meters above sea level (2000–2100 feet). Its coordinates are 40° 18' N 3° 43' W. The municipal district is 78.74 km, with a perimeter of 46.5 km. The easternmost part of the municipal district is located within the Parque Regional del Sureste, a protected forest region.\n\nDue to its central location within the Iberian Peninsula, Getafe is no more than 725.6 km from any Spanish provincial capital in mainland Spain. The following are the distances to a few major cities, the oceans which surround the Spanish coasts, and the national borders of Portugal and France.\n\nThe municipal district is mostly flat, with a minor inclination of 5% to the east and an elevation of 631 m (2070 ft) above sea level. The lowest altitude can be found to the extreme east, at the Manzanares River at 540 m (1772 ft). The highest elevation is found on the extreme west, on Buenavista, a 704 m (2310 ft) hill which sits on the border between the municipalities of Getafe and Leganés, some 12 km South of Madrid. The hilliest area, the hills of the Marañosa, is located in the Southeast and has a maximum elevation of 698 m (2290 ft). In the center of Getafe is the Cerro de los Ángeles, or \"hill of angels\" (670 m; 2198 ft). Pine forests have been planted at the feet of these hills to deter the erosion of the soil.\n\nA number of rivers and other natural waterways pass through Getafe. 9.5 km of the Manzanares River passes through the eastern-most parts of the municipal district. In the South, 16.5 km of the Culebro Waterway winds its way across Getafe, and in the Southeast 2 km of the Filipinas gully descent from the hills of the Marañosa. There are two man-made canals, one on each side of the Manzanares River. These parallel canals provide water for cultivated land further from the river.\n\nThe lakes of Perals are 2 km East of the Cerro de los Ángeles, and are some of the only undisturbed natural lakes left in the region. For this reason, the lakes are part of a protected area to preserve their natural state.\n\nThe Culebra waterway and the Filipinas gully boast heavy water flow during the winter and little to none during the summer. In contrast, the Manzanares carries water year round. For that reason, Getafe is considered to be within the Manzanares river basin, except for a small portion in the southeast which is part of the Jarama river basin.\n\nThe city of Getafe borders the following municipalities: to the North, Madrid (city districts Villaverde and Vallecas; to the East, Rivas Vaciamadrid; to the Southeast, San Martín de la Vega; to the South, Pinto; to the Southwest, Fuenlabrada; to the West, Leganés.\n\nThe climate of Getafe is Mediterranean and is influenced by urban conditions. Winters are cool, with temperatures dropping below 10 °C (46.4 °F) during the day, and frequently below 2 °C (32 °F) at night. Getafe averages three to four snowfalls per year. Summers are very hot, with median temperatures above 25 °C (75.2 °F) in July and August, and with maximum temperatures which often reach 35 °C (95 °F). Daily temperatures oscillate within range of 10 °C (18 °F).\n\nPrecipitations are regularly distributed throughout the year, excluding the dry summer months. The rainiest month is October, with 50 mm of rainfall, and the driest month is July, with only 9.4 mm. Average yearly precipitation is around 365 mm (17.52 in).\n\nOne of the major problems of Getafe's climate is air pollution, which increases noticeably when the wind blows South or Southeast. The average annual temperature is 15 °C, with the highest temperature on record listed at 41.6 °C (106.8 °F) on 24 July 1995, and the lowest temperature recorded at -12 °C (10.4 °F) on 5 February 1963. The average relative humidity is 71%, average pressure is 1,015.8 millibars, average number of daylight hours per year is 2,850, and the winds blow predominantly from the northeast.\n\nExtreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and tornadoes, never occur in Getafe thanks to its climate and geography. One common problem in the interior of the Iberian Peninsula is drought, which occurs whenever precipitation ceases during various months.\n\nThe native vegetation of Getafe is characteristic of the mediterranean forest biome, consisting mostly of holm and cork oaks. Native flowering plants include those of the genus \"Cistus\" and the common broom (\"Cytisus scoparius\"), though these species are not abundant. This native forest and underbrush only occupies 16% of the surface of the municipal territory, mostly in the hills of the Marañosa and further east. The shores of the Manzanares River and Culebro Waterway contain deciduous trees and reeds.\n\nMost undeveloped land is devoted to the cultivation of cereals (mostly wheat), and, to a lesser extent, to gardens in the fertile lowlands of the Manzanares river. Some areas have been reforested with stone pines (\"Pinus pinea\") and aleppo pines (\"Pinus halepensis\"). These areas include the Cerro de los Ángeles, the Prado Acedinos, part of the hills of the Marañosa, and part of the park in the Sector III neighborhood. Common trees in the parks and streets of the city are the horse chestnut (\"Aesculus hippocastanum\"), the acacia, the elm (\"Ulmus minor\"), and the stone pine. Other less common trees include cedars, cypress, aleppo pines, plum trees, poplars, fir trees, and palm trees.\n\nA significant population of small birds live within the city proper, including sparrows and pigeons. Larger birds, rabbits, foxes, wild boars, and weasels can be found in the more easterly parts of the municipality. The world's largest population of the common kestrel can be found in the Perales del Río neighborhood.\n\nThe urban portions of Getafe are organised in an almost longitudinal manner, from northeast to southwest. Thus, the elongated shape of Getafe today is due primarily to the close proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which impedes city growth to the southeast. The most important streets of the city are Calle Madrid and Calle Toledo. These two roads are pedestrian through the center of Getafe, and are part of what was a royal road connecting Madrid and Toledo during the Middle Ages. Getafe has other important streets and avenues organizing its neighborhoods, such as the Avenida de España, Avenida de Los Ángeles, Avenida de las Ciudades, Avenida Juan Carlos I, and Calle Ferrocarril.\n\nThe popular architectural style in Getafe is generally characterised by two-story buildings with tile roofs, various small balconies on the second floor, and a bare brick façade. These types of houses can be found in the Getafe Centro neighbourhood, though their numbers are decreasing as existing houses are vacated and demolished to make room for new townhouse developments. The average height of buildings in Getafe is five floors, approximately 60 feet (17 metres). This peculiarity is due to the proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which places limits on the height of buildings. Few buildings in Getafe surpass eight stories in height.\n\nDue to the developmental limitations imposed by the Air Force Base and the municipality borders, the city's parks and green spaces are important conservation areas. Two of the largest parks are located within the Sector III and La Alhóndiga neighbourhoods. These green zones include an artificial lake and river, two pine forests, and a number of hiking trails. The parks cover an area approximately the size of Getafe Centro, and make up the western part of the urban centre, separated from the east by the A-42. A series of parks of various sizes are located within the city proper. Outside of the city are two pine forests with picnic areas, fountains, and kiosks.\n\nGetafe's urban centre is undergoing various expansions of its urban centre. One of these is the construction and establishment of the El Bercial neighbourhood. This expansion of El Bercial will quadruple the size of the neighbourhood and will allow the city to expand to the northeast, linking El Bercial to the urban centre. The Los Olivos industrial park is expanding eastward, while at the same time, the Perales del Río neighbourhood grows westward, bringing these two neighbourhoods closer together. The Área Tecnológica del Sur is being constructed in the southern parts of the municipal district, along the M-50. The Área will be an area dedicated to a number of exposition halls and areas for new industrial development.\n\nGetafe township has a number of projects underway to expand urban areas. One of these projects is expanding the Sector III neighborhood by constructing housing at the feel of Buenavista hill. Another project involves creating a residential neighborhood called Los Molinos, located east of Getafe Norte and north of the Los Ángeles industrial park. A third project calls for the construction of a university, the \"Universidad Politécnica de Getafe\", which will include three departments and a central building.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, Getafe had only one neighbourhood, which encompassed the modern Getafe Centro and La Alhóndiga neighborhoods. The Perales del Río neighborhood is also one of the oldest neighbourhoods in the municipality, dating from approximately the 17th century. Since the 1960s, a population boom prompted the creation of new neighbourhoods, such as those of San Isidro, Juan de la Cierva, Las Margaritas, and El Bercial. In the 1980s, the Sector III neighbourhood was built and the Perales del Río was significantly expanded. During the following decade, the Getafe Norte neighbourhood was built. Today, Getafe is divided into nine neighbourhoods and five industrial parks.\n\n\nThis city has grown substantially in the past decades, which has caused similar growth in the number of infrastructures. Some of the more notable of these are:\n\nThe municipality has a number of local newspapers. These include \"El Buzón\" and \"El Iceberg\", which can both be found online and in print, \"El Buzón de Getafe\", \"Observador\", \"Acción Getafense\", \"Vivir en Getafe\", \"Getafe Ahora\", the sports weekly digest \"Zona Sur\", \"Boletín del Ayuntamiento\", \"Getafe al día\", \"Getafe Capital\" and \"Mercado\", among others. The local radio broadcast, \"Radio Getafe\", was absorbed by Cadena COPE (101.8 FM). During the 1990s, the city had its own local television station called \"Tele Getafe\". In addition, there exists even more digital-only media.\n\nFour highways and divided highways pass through Getafe: two beltways (A-42 and A-4) and two highways leading through Madrid (M-45 and M-50). Another two-lane road connects Getafe with Leganés, and two provincial roads lead to Perales del Río. The following is a list of major arteries:\n\n\n\n\nThe Air Force Base is for military use only. As it is, the city center of Getafe is 26 km from Madrid Barajas International Airport, which can be accessed via the M-40.\n\nThe city has eight urban bus lines; eight lines connecting Getafe to Madrid; five lines to the municipalities of Valdemoro, Leganés, Alcorcón, Parla, Serranillos, Casarrubuelos and Griñón; and two night lines to Madrid. These lines are as follows:\nTwo Cercanías Madrid train lines pass through Getafe along a north–south route. These lines are: C-3 (stations: \"El Casar\" and \"Getafe Industrial\") and C-4 (stations: \"Las Margaritas-Universidad\", \"Getafe Centro\", and \"Getafe Sector III\"). There are a total of five stations, two of which connect to the Madrid metro system.\n\nSince April 2003, Getafe contains eight stations along the Madrid metro Line 12. These stations are: \"El Bercial\", \"Los Espartales\", \"El Casar\", \"Juan de la Cierva\", \"Getafe Central\", \"Alonso de Mendoza\", \"Conservatorio\" y \"Arroyo Culebro\". The government of the Community of Madrid is currently planning on expanding Line 3 through the \"El Casar\" station.\n\nThe population of Getafe, estimated at 159,300 in 2007 by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, is unevenly distributed across a number of neighborhoods: Sector III, San Isidro, Perales del Río, Las Margaritas, La Alhóndiga, Juan de la Cierva, Getafe Norte, El Bercial, and Getafe Central.\n\nThe Getafe Centro neighborhood has the most housing, with 12,574 units; the Juan de la Cierva neighborhood is a close second with 12,072 housing units. The least developed in terms of housing are the neighborhoods of Perales del Río and El Bercial, with 1815 and 1820 units respectively, though these numbers are expected to increase shortly due to a number of recently implemented urban initiatives. The most populous neighborhoods are those of Juan de la Cierva (32,925 inhabitants), Getafe Centro (32,160 inhabitants), and Sector III (24,217 inhabitants). 30,000 inhabitants of Getafe are between the ages of 20 and 40, and 24 inhabitants are 100 years old or more (21 women, 3 men). Women out-number men in Getafe, numbering 79,514 women to 78,849 men.\n\nThe foreign population of Getafe increases every year, and makes up about 9% of the total population. Immigrants generally come from Latin America, eastern Europe, and western Europe. The constant annual growth rate falls between 0.01% and 3.00%, birth rate falls between 0.01% and 8%, and the death rate falls between 4% and 8%. From 1996 to 2002, the growth rate of Getafe fell between 5 and 10%. The median age of inhabitants is less than 22 years. More than 85% of the population consider themselves Catholic, but only 20% of these people are actual active members of Catholic congregations.\n\nThe population of Getafe has experienced strong growth during the second half of the 20th century. From the Middle Ages to 1900, the population varied between 2,500 and 6,000 inhabitants. In 1950, the population was 12,254; in 1970, the population was 69,424; in 1977, 124,601. These figures demonstrate the population growth spurt that began in 1960 and continues to the present day. At present, the city's population is generally growing at a continual, moderate rate, at approximately 1,700 people per year. The year 2006 was the first year since the 17th century that the population actually decreased, falling by 2,043 people.\n\nGetafe is listed as the 41st most populous city in Spain, after Salamanca and before Logroño. Within the community of Madrid, Getafe is the 7th most populous city, after Alcorcón and before Torrejón de Ardoz. An inhabitant of Getafe is called \"getafeño\" or \"getafense\", though the latter is more common. The postal codes of the city are: 28901, 28902, 28903, 28904, 28905, 28907, 28909.\n\nGetafe's economy was historically agricultural. The first factories were built in the area at the beginning of the 20th century, but it wasn't until the second half of the century that industry gained prominence. By the 1960s, industry had become the primary economic focus.\n\nToday, the economy is mostly industrial, with a large focus on Getafe's five industrial parks. After Madrid, Getafe is the most industrialized city in the community of Madrid, with numerous industries such as John Deere, Siemens, and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA. The city boasts five industrial parks spread across the peripheries of the city. The city's industrial activities are divided across several industries: 34% metallurgy, 20% food processing, 14% wood and furniture production, 6% textile, furs, and skins. The remaining 26% includes various other industries, such as paper production, graphic arts, and construction, among others. A number of quarries are located in the easterly areas of the municipality which are being mined extensively.\n\nThe service industry began to emerge at the end of the 1990s with the construction of several new malls and entertainment areas. The importance of agriculture on the local economy has decreased significantly in the past century, though eastern parts of the municipality still include good plots of irrigated and nonirrigated land. The major crop is wheat, with smaller cultivations of olive trees, grape vines, and vegetables. Herding and livestock are slowly diminishing, though they can still be found in the vicinity of Buenavista hill and the fields along the Manzanares river.\n\nThe median per capita income of the inhabitants of Getafe is 10,000 €, which is lower than the 12,500 € median income of the community of Madrid. The most wealthy neighborhoods are Sector III and Getafe Norte, with a median income of 13,000 €. The poorest neighborhoods are La Alhóndiga, Getafe Centro, and San Isidro, whose median incomes average 9,000 €. In January 2006, the unemployment rate was 8.4%\n\nGetafe has a number of monuments and areas of interest pertaining to its history. The most famous and most visited part of Getafe is the Cerro de los Ángeles, but there are other important places, such as the Catedral de Nuestra Señora de La Magdalena and the Hospitalillo de San José.\n\n\nCulture in Getafe is represented by various institutions, such as the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, whose academic rector and three faculties of the humanities and legal sciences are located in Getafe. This university has an award-winning chorus and orchestras which is renowned throughout all of Spain. The Conservatorio Profesional de Música de Getafe (\"Professional Conservatory of Music of Getafe\"), which was established in 2000, has become the public conservatory for the entire Southern region of the autonomous community of Madrid. The Teatro Auditorio Federico García Lorca (\"Theater Auditorium Federico García Lorca\"), one of the largest and most important in Southern Madrid, is the setting for a multitude of plays and concerts. In addition to these establishments, Getafe boasts eight civic centers and a chain of public libraries spread across the different neighborhoods of Getafe. The Centro de Poesía José Hierro (\"José Hierro Center of Poetry\"), a place for the creation and study, is located alongside the library of Sector III. The legacy of the poet José Hierro can be found within this center, along with historical magazines, a photo library, and a video library. In 2005, began a project to construct the \"Museo de la Aviación de Getafe\" (\"Getafe Aviation Museum\"), which will be designed by the prestigious architect Norman Foster.\nClose to 40% of the inhabitants of Getafe come from distinct autonomous communities within Madrid. Many of these groups have created \"Casas Regionales\" (\"Regional Houses\"), places were people from similar regional backgrounds can meet for cultural activities. Some of the more prominent Casas Regionales are those of Extremadura, Castile-La Mancha, Murcia, Andalusia, and Castile and León. The Conservatorio Profesional de Música de Getafe offers concerts of classical music in its 400-seats concert hall.\n\nThe patron saint's day in Getafe is celebrated 40 days after Easter Sunday, which means that the feast day occurs on a different day each year. The feast day generally falls between mid-May and early June. The feast officially begin on that Saturday, but celebrations generally begin nine days prior, on the day of the Ascension—the day that the Virgin of the Angels descended from the Cerro de los Ángeles.\n\nNine days after the ascension, the celebrations begin officially. The \"sábado de las fiestas\" (\"Saturday of the festivities\"), as it is popularly known, begins with an address in the Plaza de la Constitución, following an explosive display of the concussive effects of co-ordinated firecracker and fireworks barrages in the Calle Jardines. A fair is held during these days on the fairgrounds, political parties set up stalls on the Calle Ferrocarril, and there are a number of cultural activities, including concerts and bull fights. A week after the beginning of festivities, a procession passes through the center of town, during which caramels and trinkets are thrown into the crowds. The festivities end eight days after the opening address.\n\nA number of cultural activities occur during the days of Christmas, such as special Christmas concerts, a large Christmas pageant in the interior patio of the Hospitalillo de San José, and the processions of the Three Wise Men on 5 January. Traditionally Carnivals include cavalcades of disguises and cultural activities. Two to four religious processions occur during Holy Week, originating from various churches and moving through the streets of the city.\n\nPublic education in Getafe includes six pre-schools (up to 5 years), 23 elementary schools (until 12 years), and 14 secondary schools. There are few private schools, the most important being: the Piarist schools of religious education; the Colegio Los Ángeles, which educated children from age 1 through their second year of Bachillerato (a specialized educational program of 2 to 4 years after secondary school but before university); Los Aristos, a school with a sports club and covered pool. There are a number of professional development centers located throughout Getafe. Finally, the academic rector of the Universidad Carlos III is located in Getafe, along with three of its humanities and judicial science faculties. Alongside the university is the student housing complex \"Fernando de los Ríos.\"\n\nThe typical gastronomy of Getafe is very similar, if not identical, to that of Madrid. The climate, the local produce, and history have contributed to the development of this varied gastronomy. The dishes most representative of Getafe are the \"cocido madrileño\", tripe \"a la madrileña\", chickpea stew, Spanish omelette, sea bream \"a la madrileña\", red cabbage, and others. In terms of wine, the most prominent are the wines of Madrid. Of these, the most famous are those of San Martín de Valdeiglesias, Arganda del Rey, and Navalcarnero.\n\nIn the large malls and on the central streets of Getafe, it is possible to find a variety of restaurants. One of the most luxurious and recognized of these is \"Las Moreras\", located between the train station of Las Margaritas-Universidad and the student housing area.\n\nGetafe is a city for shopping and entertainment; many stores are conveniently situated in the urban center and within various large shopping malls. In Centro, the oldest and most populous neighborhood in Getafe, the area with the most stores and businesses is the intersection between Toledo Street and Madrid Street. These boulevards are mostly pedestrian. Another commercialized central area is the Avenue of Juan de la Cierva.\n\nFurther away from the center, is another mall called \"Getafe 3\", which is located within the neighborhood Sector III. This complex contains an Auchan (international retail chain), various restaurants, and many clothing and shoe stores. In the neighborhood Getafe Norte is the \"Bulevar\", where there is a Carrefour, many restaurants, seven movie theaters, and numerous clothing stores. The major shopping mall called \"Nassica\" is situated in the Área Tecnológica del Sur, accessible via the M-50. Nassica has electronics and hardware stores, furniture stores, 25 restaurants, a bowling alley, recreational areas, a permanent street market, and 20 cinemas. The newest mall, called \"El Bercial\", can be found in the neighborhood El Bercial. It contains an El Corte Inglés, a Hipercor, and two cafeteria-restaurants. The area known for its nightlife is found in Centro, which contains the most tapas bars and discos in the city.\n\nDespite Getafe's proximity to the highly developed city of Madrid, the Getafe includes two pine forests, which have tables, picnic areas, barbecues, soccer fields, and children's parks. One of these forests is the Prado Acedinos, located the South of the urban center, accessible via exit 16 on the A-42. The other is the Cerro de los Ángeles, accessible via the A-4.\n\nThe major sport in Getafe, much like in the rest of Spain, is football. The local football team is the Getafe CF. On 19 June 2004, the team was promoted to the Spanish first division. On 23 June 2007, the team reached the finals of the Copa del Rey, which were held in the area. In 2015 the team was relegated to second division, but it was promoted again the following year, remaining in the first division since then.\n\nOther popular sports include basketball, tennis, bicycling, and motor sports. During the local festivals every June, the town celebrates the \"day of the bicycle\" whereupon tens of thousands of locals bike through the streets of Getafe noncompetitively. Another important sports event is the Getafe Marathon, which is held every January and which attracts a large number of athletes.\n\nThe city is home to seven sports centers scattered across various neighborhoods. The largest are those of the neighborhoods of San Isidro and Las Margaritas. Getafe also has a skate park, located behind the Conservatorio Profesional de Música de Getafe (musical conservatory), and three municipal pools, which can be found in the neighborhoods of Sector III, Getafe Norte, and Perales del Río. The soccer stadium, Coliseum Alfonso Pérez, is located in the neighborhood of Getafe Norte, and can sit 14,400 spectators. In anticipation of the local soccer team's rise to the first division, the public pool in Getafe Norte was expanded to include a training center.\n\nGetafe has a good public health system. The city has eleven public healthcare facilities throughout the neighborhoods of Juan de la Cierva, Las Margaritas, La Alhóndiga, Getafe Norte, Sector III, El Bercial, and Perales del Río. The University Hospital of Getafe, opened in the 1990s, is the population's principal healthcare facility. The Hospital, located alongside the La Alhóndiga neighborhood, is famous throughout Spain for its care of burn victims. The \"Apanid\", a residential facility specializing in the care of people with Down syndrome, is located on the Prado Acedinos (street), approximately 5 km south of the city center. This facility is the only of its kind in the southern area of the community of Madrid.\n\nGetafe is home to a number of curiosities and special characteristics rare among other municipalities. Some of these include:\n\nTraditionally, the geographical center of the Iberian Peninsula is located in the Cerro de los Ángeles.\n\nThe Perales del Río neighborhood boasts the world's largest population of the common kestrel (\"Falco tinnunculus\").\n\nGetafe's antipodal point is in the southeast of the North Island of New Zealand, 15 km southeast of the agricultural town of Dannevirke.\n\n\nGetafe is an active participant in the European Union's town twinning initiative. It currently has three sister cities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

He has also published books on Chinese astrology.\n\nFantoni was born in London's East End to an Italian father and a Jewish mother of French and Dutch extraction, both gifted musicians. He was educated at the Archbishop Temple School in London. At the age of fourteen, he was awarded the Wedgewood Scholarship for the Arts and studied at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1954 until 1958. There, he formed the school's first jazz group as well as a film society and pioneered a drama group before getting expelled. \n\nIn 1963, Fantoni became a member of the editorial staff of the satirical magazine \"Private Eye\". He was behind some of the magazine's most famous characters, and appeared in all but 31 of its 1,278 issues until his retirement in 2010. He also wrote scripts for the BBC TV programme \"That Was the Week That Was\" in 1962.\n\nFantoni also hosted a short-lived BBC TV show called \"A Whole Scene Going\" in 1966, which won him the title of Male TV Personality of the Year. The show focused on contemporary trends in the arts: Twiggy made her first appearance on the show, and it also featured performances from the likes of The Who, The Kinks and The Pretty Things.\n\nOn 27 January 2007 he debuted on BBC Radio Five Live's \"Fighting Talk\". He scored 28 points thus finishing in last place which is a programme tradition for a debutant. In September 2007 he was a guest on \"Private Passions\", the weekly music discussion programme hosted by Michael Berkeley on BBC Radio 3.\n\nFantoni is also the creator and writer of poems supposedly penned by one E. J. Thribb — the fictitious poet-in-residence at \"Private Eye\". His poems are usually about recently deceased famous people, and always begin \"So, farewell then...\".\n\nThribb also usually mentions the deceased's \"catchphrase\" or theme song and his poems often feature his friend Keith, or Keith's mum, who usually does something \"like\" the deceased. The poetry consists of a stream of consciousness which is just broken up into lines.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1810154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810154", "title": "Old Aberdeen", "text": "Old Aberdeen\n\nOld Aberdeen is part of the city of Aberdeen in Scotland. Old Aberdeen was originally a separate burgh, which was erected into a burgh of barony on 26 December 1489. It was incorporated into adjacent Aberdeen by Act of Parliament in 1891. It retains the status of a community council area.\n\nThe town's motto is \"\"concordia res parvae crescunt\"\" (\"through harmony, small things increase\").\n\nTo the north of Aberdeen city centre, Old Aberdeen was for a long time fairly isolated at the edge of the city, being followed to the north by the River Don, Seaton Park and the small Brig o' Balgownie hamlet. Since the 1960s, and the North Sea oil boom of the 1970s, however, housing development has surrounded the area, in particular with the nearby Tillydrone development.\n\nOld Aberdeen was an important political, ecclesiastical and cultural centre since the Late Middle Ages. In the 1630s the Covenanters challenged the Doctors of Aberdeen by holding a meeting in Muchalls Castle and responding to certain letters issued by the doctors, thus setting the stage for the first battle of the Bishops' Wars, when William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal and the Marquess of Montrose led a Covenanter army of 9,000 men over the Causey Mounth to attack forces at the Bridge of Dee, effectively gaining control of Old Aberdeen.\n\nThe central part of the old town is a conservation area rich in historical buildings, some dating to the Middle Ages, and many vernacular buildings of the 17th-early 19th centuries built in the locally ubiquitous grey granite. A notable feature of the later buildings is the early use of hand-made bricks to build up gables, top garden walls, etc.; this use of brick being rare elsewhere in Scotland before the late 19th century. A number of the streets remain paved with stone setts. There are also several university buildings from the late 20th century.\n\nOld Aberdeen is effectively the main campus of the University of Aberdeen. There are also residential and commercial properties, but many of these are owned by the university or owned by the staff and students of the university. Additionally the area includes a small police station, a pub, a bakery, and until recently its own Post Office. To the north of the university lies St Machar's Cathedral, whose medieval ecclesiastical buildings formed the original Old Aberdeen before the University arrived in 1495.\n\nMajor historic buildings in Old Aberdeen include: the late 15th Century King's College Chapel, one of two surviving Scottish medieval churches with open \"crown\" spires, and which has the largest surviving collection of medieval woodcarving in any Scottish building; St Machar's Cathedral itself; the recently restored Old Town House (early 18th century); and the Brig o' Balgownie (14th Century), now pedestrianised, and which is a contender for the title of Scotland's oldest surviving bridge.\n\nOld Aberdeen is now fully incorporated into the City of Aberdeen, with its local authority as Aberdeen City Council. Old Aberdeen remains a community council area within the city. For elections to Aberdeen City Council, Old Aberdeen forms part of the 'Tillydrone/ Seaton/Old Aberdeen' electoral ward, which elects three councillors. These are currently Jim Noble, Alex McLellan (both SNP), and Ross Grant (Labour) \n\nFor elections to the House of Commons in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Old Aberdeen forms part of the Aberdeen North constituency. The current Member of Parliament for Aberdeen North is Kirsty Blackman. For elections to the Scottish Parliament, it elects a constituency member as part of the Aberdeen Central constituency. The current Member of the Scottish Parliament for Aberdeen Central is Kevin Stewart.\n\nThe iconic and renowned buildings of King's College are perhaps the dominant structures of Old Aberdeen. The College itself now finds itself surrounded by the wider Old Aberdeen campus of the University of Aberdeen which, since the decline of Marischal College, is now the main focal point of the university. The area boasts two museums, King's Museum, which features changing exhibitions from the stores of the University and the Zoology Museum, home to the natural history collection belonging to the University.\n\nThe Old Town House was the original home of the Burgh's local government, completed in 1789. It was originally the centrepoint for trading in Old Aberdeen (still discernible in the widening of the street to accommodate trading booths), and the mercat cross (head late medieval, shaft more recent) stands outside it. The building is built of granite and is of restrained but elegant early Georgian design, with a fine cupola above the façade. It was acquired by the university in recent years, and was renovated in 2005. The Old Town House now houses King's Museum.\n\nThe Cathedral Church of St Machar is the high kirk of the city of Aberdeen and following the Reformation lies in the hands of the Church of Scotland.\n\nThe Cruickshank Botanic Gardens were gifted to the University of Aberdeen and opened in 1898. The gardens are set over and are accessible to the public for no charge.\n\nJust south of King's College and across the High Street lie the Powis Gates, an impressive and imposing archway with a Near Eastern influence demonstrated in its 'minaret' towers. These were erected in 1834 by Hugh Fraser Leslie of Powis, the owner of an estate which formerly lay behind them. The Fraser Leslie Arms are visible on the obverse of the arch, with a shield on the reverse showing the bust of three black men - a link to the family's involvement in a grant of freedom made to their slaves in Jamaica (or possibly impaled arms celebrating a marriage between a member of the Leslie family and a member of the Moir of Scotstoun family). The entrance now leads to the University's Crombie-Johnston and King's Postgraduate Halls of Residence.\n\nTo the north boundary of Old Aberdeen lies Seaton Park, one of the city's largest open spaces. The park itself lies on the banks of the River Don. It is set over twenty-seven hectares and was purchased by the city for public use in 1947.\n\n"}

It is bounded by Madison Avenue to the west, East 41st Street to the south, and Park Avenue to the east.\n\nDesigned in neo-Gothic style by architect Kenneth Norton of James Edwin Ruthven Carpenter Jr., the skyscraper was completed in 1930. At tall, it is tied with the Barclay Tower as the 81st tallest building in New York City, though it is dwarfed by other buildings in the area, including the Chrysler Building, MetLife Building, and One Vanderbilt across the street. It also has a direct in-building access to Grand Central Terminal.\n\nAmong the building's features are the Gothic windows at the top. In June 2009, the Lincoln Building name was changed to One Grand Central Place, and it has undergone a $85 million renovation, which included new windows, renovated elevators, renovated air-conditioned public corridors and restrooms, and upgraded building-wide systems.\n\nIn March 2020, One Grand Central Place was at the center of New York's first reported person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 1956, Lawrence Wien purchased Daniel Chester French's 3′ bronze model of Abraham Lincoln—a cast of one of the sketches used to create the statue for the Lincoln Memorial—from his daughter, Margaret French Cresson, for $3,000. The sculpture was put on display in the visitor's center, located in the lobby, in the same year. When the building was renamed One Grand Central Place in 2009, the model was removed and loaned to Chesterwood in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. It was put back on display on April 15, 2015.\n\n"}
{"id": "1810159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810159", "title": "National War Memorial (Canada)", "text": "National War Memorial (Canada)\n\nThe National War Memorial (French: \"Monument commémoratif de guerre\"), titled The Response (French: \"La Réponse\") is a tall, granite memorial arch with accreted bronze sculptures in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, designed by Vernon March and first dedicated by King George VI in 1939. Originally built to commemorate the Canadians who died in the First World War, it was in 1982 rededicated to also include those killed in the Second World War and Korean War and again in 2014 to add the dead from the Second Boer War and War in Afghanistan, as well as all Canadians killed in all conflicts past and future. It now serves as the pre-eminent war memorial of 76 cenotaphs in Canada. In 2000, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was added in front of the memorial and symbolizes the sacrifices made by all Canadians who have died or may yet die for their country.\n\nThe National War Memorial is the focal point of Confederation Square in Canada's capital city, Ottawa, Ontario. This locates it between Parliament Hill to the west and the Château Laurier hotel to the east. There are several other commemorative buildings and monuments nearby, including the Peace Tower (and the Memorial Chamber) at the parliament buildings, the National Aboriginal Veterans Monument, the Animals in War Memorial, a Boer War memorial, the Peacekeeping Monument, the Valiants Memorial, and the War of 1812 Monument.\n\nThe memorial, from grade to the tip of the surmounting statues' wings, is approximately 21.34 m (70 ft), with the arch itself 3.05 m (10 ft) wide, 2.44 m (8 ft) deep, and 8.03 m (26 ft 4 in) high. The lowest step of the pedestal is 15.9 m (52 ft 2 in) by 8.08 m (26 ft 6 in). 503 tonnes of rose-grey Canadian granite from the Dumas Quarry at Rivière-à-Pierre, Quebec, and 32 tonnes of bronze were used, all of which rests on a block of reinforced concrete based on steel columns set into bedrock.\n\nTwo allegories of peace and freedom stand at the apex of the arch, their proximity to each other representing the inseparability of the two concepts, though, the figure bearing a torch alludes in Roman mythology to Demeter and the winged figure with a laurel depicts Nike, the Greek goddesses of agriculture and victory, respectively. Below are the depictions of 22 Canadian servicemen from all branches of the forces and other groups engaged in the First World War. At front, to the left, a Lewis gunner, to the right, a kilted infantryman with a Vickers machine gun. Following these are a pilot in full gear and an air mechanic of the Royal Canadian Air Force, as well as a sailor in the Royal Canadian Navy from HMCS \"Stadacona\". Two mounted figures—a member of the Canadian Cavalry Brigade and a dispatch rider—are emerging from the arch, side by side, followed by two infantry riflemen pressing through the arch and behind them are the men and women of the support services, including two nurses from the Militia Army Medical Corps, a stretcher bearer, and one member each of the Royal Canadian Engineers and the Canadian Forestry Corps. Further, there is one member each of the Canadian Army Service Corps, the Canadian Signals Corps, the Corps of Canadian Railway troops, the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, and the Motor Machine Gun Corps. There are three additional infantrymen; all six carry among them respirators and other items of the \"basic load\" carried by every member of the infantry.\n\nThe figures are moving towards the call of duty atop a pedestal. To avoid foreshortening from a pedestrian viewpoint, the group of figures is placed at a specific height above street level; each body is approximately high, or one third larger than life size. The postures are animated and strained, not in parade form, and the expressions \"convey pride, longing, defiance, a strong sense of purpose, vacancy, camaraderie and perhaps a touch of dejection, but mostly firm resolve.\" All are in historically correct and distinctly Canadian uniforms, and they were deliberately rendered by the sculpture's artist, Vernon March, so as to not associate any with a particular region of the country nor any ethnicity or language, thus highlighting unity.\n\nOf the memorial, March wrote \"[I intend] to perpetuate in this bronze group the people of Canada who went Overseas to the Great War, and to represent them, as we of today saw them, as a record for future generations...\" The allegorical representations of peace and freedom were meant to be seen \"alighting on the world with the blessings of Victory, Peace and Liberty in the footsteps of the people's heroism and self-sacrifice who are passing through the archway below.\" The persons emerging through the arch have also been interpreted as representing Canada's \"rite of passage\" or \"coming of age\", its birth as a proper nation during the First World War, reflected in its attainment of a place in the negotiations of the Treaty of Versailles at the conflict's end. Similarly, the figures of Peace and Freedom \"speak both to Canada's participation in the struggle to achieve lasting stability and democratic values that resulted in the creation of the League of Nations, and to the hope that in Canada itself peace and freedom may continue to triumph over the forces of instability and the tyrannies of ethnicity.\" Laura Brandon, Historian, Art & War at the National War Museum in Ottawa, opined that the agricultural connotations of the torch-bearing figure may have been intended by March to relate to the dominance of agriculture in Canada at the time of the monument's design. It may also refer to the line in the war poem \"In Flanders Fields\", penned by John McCrae while in the battlefields of the First World War: \"The torch; be yours to hold it high/If ye break faith with us who die.\"\n\nOn the north and south faces of the statuary base are the dates 1914–1918 (the First World War) above the words \"Service to Canada/Au service du Canada\", which are intended to include all Canadians who served in all armed conflicts, past, present, and future. The dates 1939–1945 (the Second World War) and 1950–1953 (the Korean War) are on the east and west flanks of the base, while the years 1899–1902 (the Second Boer War) and 2001–2014 (the War in Afghanistan) are on the east and west arch pier footings, respectively. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier rests in the podium surface immediately in front of and on axis with the war memorial.\n\nSince 1940, the National War Memorial is the site of the national Remembrance Day ceremony, organised every year by the Royal Canadian Legion for 11 November. Along with Canadian war veterans, the ceremony is attended by the governor general, sometimes members of the Canadian Royal Family, the prime minister, the Silver Cross Mother, representatives of the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, members of the diplomatic corps, and youth representatives. Some of these groups place wreaths at the foot of the war memorial. The event is attended by between 25,000 and 45,000 people and is nationally televised.\n\nBefore each Remembrance Day ceremony, Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) repairs and levels stones in the area of the war memorial, fills joints, waxes the bronzes, and applies a protective coating to the lettering on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Plywood is placed over surrounding flower beds and approximately 6,000 metres of cable is run to connect sound systems and 12 television cameras. Any mementos or pictures attendees leave at the memorial following the ceremony are given to the Canadian War Museum for review and possible storage, while any money left is donated to The Perley & Rideau Veterans' Health Centre.\n\nWhenever the monarch or another member of the Royal Family is in Ottawa, they will, regardless of the date, lay a wreath at the monument. Visiting foreign dignitaries will also sometimes lay a wreath at the monument; prominent figures who have done so include US President John F. Kennedy in 1961, Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990, US Secretary of State John Kerry, and French President François Hollande in 2014.\n\nThe Department of Canadian Heritage and the Department of Veterans Affairs also fund summer students at the site, hired to provide site and historical information.\n\nFull Article: 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa#National War Memorial\n\nThe 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill were a series of shootings that occurred on October 22, 2014, at Parliament Hill in Ottawa. At the Canadian National War Memorial, Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian soldier on ceremonial sentry duty was fatally shot by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.\n\nShortly before 10:00 a.m. , on October 22, 2014, witnesses saw Zehaf-Bibeau arrive at the National War Memorial carrying a rifle, which was later identified as a .30–30 Winchester Model 94 lever-action hunting rifle. He was dressed in blue jeans and a black jacket, with a keffiyeh scarf over the lower part of his face. He approached Corporal Nathan Cirillo of The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's), who was one of three sentries from the Ceremonial Guard posted at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. At close range, Zehaf-Bibeau shot Cirillo twice in the back, fatally wounding him. Cirillo, like all others who have stood sentry at the memorial, carried an unloaded firearm. It was only minutes before the end of the sentries' shift, which ended at 10:00 a.m. Cpl. Kyle Button and Cpl. Branden Stevenson, two other soldiers on sentry duty, attempted to stop Zehaf-Bibeau, but they were shot at by him and forced to flee to the other side of the Memorial. Zehaf-Bibeau then pulled down his scarf, held his rifle one-handedly over his head and yelled, \"For Iraq.\" Cpl. Anthony Wiseman, who was nearby, then attempted to stop Zehaf-Bibeau, but Zehaf-Bibeau attempted to run him over. The three soldiers then attended to Cirillo. Along with bystanders, they applied first aid to Cirillo, attempting to resuscitate him, before Paramedic Chief Anthony DiMonte was first on scene assumed patient care until and additional Paramedics arrived to provided medical care before Cirillo was taken to hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, Zehaf-Bibeau returned to his vehicle, a small grey Toyota car, which was parked on the south side of Wellington Street behind the memorial, and drove west along Wellington a short distance to Parliament Hill, where he abandoned his vehicle. Past scattering bystanders, he ran through a gate in the fence surrounding the Parliament Hill precinct and carjacked a parliamentary vehicle assigned to ministers of the Crown, which he drove to the Centre Block parliament building. RCMP officers on patrol in the precinct witnessed the carjacking and pursued the vehicle to the base of the Peace Tower.\n\nA photograph of Zehaf-Bibeau was taken by a tourist at the war memorial during the shootings. It shows him holding the rifle and wearing a scarf over part of his face, with part of the War Memorial behind him. Ottawa police seized the camera and then took their own photograph of the image using a cellphone. French-Canadian journalist William Reymond received a copy of the photograph via the Internet, anonymously, apparently a copy of a tweet originating from the Ottawa Police of the cellphone picture. Reymond then took a picture of the image as it was displayed on his computer monitor and posted it to Twitter a few hours later after confirming the image. The image was re-tweeted by an ISIL sympathizer, leading to erroneous media reports that the image originated from an ISIL Twitter account.\n\nThe subject of a memorial to commemorate those killed in the First World War was raised even before the conflict had ended; Prime Minister Robert Borden said in 1915 \"[i]t is my desire and intention that some splendid monument shall be erected in this country, perhaps in the capital of the Dominion, which will commemorate the men who responded so splendidly to the call of duty.\" There was opposition to the idea, mostly to its cost, especially as the argument continued through the Great Depression. The Lord Beaverbrook initiated, in partnership with the government, the Canadian War Memorial Fund (CWMF) in April 1918 with the purpose of \"perpetuating the memory of what Canada has accomplished in this war\" through paintings, photographs, and the erection of memorials. An early proposal in 1919 was a memorial hall in Ottawa, to act as a social centre for between 2,000 and 4,000 people as well as a monument to the Canadians who served in the Great War. It did not grow past the concept stage, but, an idea from the CWMF for a memorial building did progress to the detail design phase. It would have resembled the Pantheon in Rome and housed the art in the CWMF's collection, while acting \"as a great war memorial in itself.\" Immediately after the war's end, however, focus shifted to the burial of the dead: the design of markers and headstones.\nTo meet a growing call across Canada for a memorial to commemorate those who died in the First World War, the Cabinet of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King suggested in 1921 that a national memorial be built in Canada. The \"Ottawa Citizen\" on 19 December 1922 reported that the government was going to announce a plan to erect just such a monument and, in parliament on the last day of the session, the Cabinet requested appropriation for a war memorial to be built in Ottawa. A site in the Gatineau Hills was originally considered but it was determined the best option was the redevelopment and expansion of downtown Ottawa's Connaught Place into a plaza for the memorial, giving it the parliament buildings—the seat of Canadian democracy—as a backdrop. This, Mackenzie King later said, put it in the most visible spot in the city, akin to The Cenotaph and Nelson's Column in London, England.\n\nIn May 1923, the Minister of Public Works James Horace King asked the legislature to approve $10,000 for the memorial. However, with the minister unable to satisfactorily answer members' questions on what the money would be used for and the Prime Minister absent, it was determined to leave the matter for another time. Subsequently, the issue was again raised on 11 May 1923, when King stated \"[i]n every country in the world the spirit of the nation has found some expression in regard to great events in the form of permanent monuments if the occasions have been sufficiently worthy of such recognition from the national point of view. The government felt that a monument should be erected in the capital of Canada expressive of the feelings of the Canadian people as a whole to the memory of those who had participated in the Great War and had lost their lives in the service of humanity.\" In response to a statement by Murray MacLaren that the central column of Confederation Hall (the main entrance) of the new Centre Block already had an inscription noting the service of Canadians who had fought overseas, Mackenzie King said the inscription made reference to many other events in Canadian history and, as such, was never meant to act as a national war memorial; he elaborated: \"there is, as of yet, no monument of a national character in the capital of the Dominion\" and what the Cabinet proposed was \"intended to be a national monument in the national capital.\"\n\nIn further debate, it was said the project should strive for \"something loftier than a monument in stone\" and not reflexively \"follow precedent, to follow ancient countries.\" Generally, the opposition was in favour of the idea, but criticised the projected costs. Mackenzie King responded: \"When a nation loses what is signified by its art it loses its own spirit, and when it loses the remembrance of the sacrifices and heroism by which it has gained the liberty it enjoys, it loses all the vision that makes a people great.\" Indeed, the Prime Minister managed to force Members of Parliament who critiqued the idea of spending money on a memorial to defend their patriotism and gratitude for those who had died or been wounded in the war. Parliament approved $10,000 to begin the project.\n\nOver two years, the parameters for a competition were created by a team consisting of, among others, the Deputy Minister of Public Works, J. B. Hunter, who had experience with the process of creating numerous memorials in Canada; Eric Brown, former Director of the National Gallery of Canada and a member of the Canadian War Artists Advisory Committee; and Colonel H. C. Osborne, who acted as Honorary Secretary of the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission. On 12 February 1925, design proposals were sought, with a budget for the monument set at $100,000. Entrants were limited to residents of the British Empire who were British subjects or who were citizens of allied nations. The competition regulations outlined the monument was intended to not be simply a tribute to those who has contributed to Canada's effort in the First World War, but also an expression of the nation's character. It was to evoke \"the spirit of heroism, the spirit of self-sacrifice, the spirit of all that is noble and great that was exemplified in the lives of those sacrificed in the Great War, and the services rendered by the men and women who went overseas.\" The competition brief explained \"[w]hile the spirit of victory is essential it should be expressed so as to not only immortalize Canada's defenders, but convey a feeling of gratitude that out of this great conflict a new hope has sprung for future prosperity under peaceful conditions.\" Absent from the document was reference to the Empire, focusing only on Canada and its efforts. This illustrated the desire for the war memorial to be a marker of Canada's attainment of nationhood.\n\nOne hundred and twenty-seven entries were submitted—66 from Canada, 24 from England, 21 from France, seven from the United States, five from Belgium, two from Italy, one from Scotland, and one from Trinidad.—of which seven were asked to provide scale models for final judging. Tasked with judging the proposals was the Board of Assessors, composed of three people drawn from Canada's architectural and artistic fields: Henry Sproatt was chosen by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada; Herman A. MacNeil by the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts; and, by the Cabinet, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery of Canada F.J. Shepherd. From among seven finalists, the winner, announced on 18 January 1926, was Vernon March from Farnborough, United Kingdom. His theme was the response of Canada to war, signified by the uniformed figures, in the then correct order of precedence, passing through the arch, but with a deliberate aim to avoid the glorification of armed conflict. March wrote in his anonymous submission that the figures' expressions would not show any combative attitude. Rather, they would \"express movement and the eagerness and enthusiasm of the people\" to respond to the call.\n\nWork on the memorial began in 1926 under the auspices of the Dominion's Department of Public Works. March was assisted by his six brothers and his sister, all of whom completed the work after March's death in 1930. His design was, over the ensuing years, revised and adjusted: the number of figures and certain dimensions increased and, accordingly, so did the estimated cost, by $85,000. This gave fuel to the parliamentary opposition, who argued the money could be better spent aiding veterans. Progressive Party Member of Parliament (MP) J. S. Woodsworth asserted in 1931: \"[i]f there is a contract…we must go through with it... but with poor unemployed soldiers in the country, I do not think we shall need many monuments for a while.\"\n\nEven through the time R. B. Bennett served as prime minister (1930 to 1935), the officials overseeing the war memorial project continued to adhere to the design principles set out by Mackenzie King and the other competition directors, demonstrating a bipartisan support for the memorial. As the accuracy of the uniforms and equipment—at March's request, down to details such as buttons and straps—was directed by Canadian officials, the sculptures were first produced in clay, from which moulds were made and the bronze was then cast in the Marchs' foundry. This work was finished in July 1932 and the bronzes were, with the permission of King George V, put on display in Hyde Park, London, within a mock-up of the granite arch and plinth. It was then that more than one member of the public pointed out that the archway was too narrow for the artillery carriage to pass through. This led the Marchs to make the arch three feet wider and six feet taller and enlarge the size of the plinth the figures would be mounted on. Those moves, though, created gaps on either side of the crowd of bronze statues, which Sydney March felt negatively impacted the overall appearance of the monument. His proposed solution was to add another three figures to the existing 19. This was approved, the bronze figures were cast, and the entire collection was put in storage at the Marchs' foundry as argument continued in Ottawa over the monument's location.\n\nDisapproval or blatant rejection of the Connaught Place site was expressed by the Federal District Commission (predecessor of the National Capital Commission), Mayor J. E. Stanley Lewis, social commentators, journalists, and members of the public. Some groups demanded the war memorial be central on Parliament Hill, others said a spot overlooking the Ottawa River, west of parliament was more appropriate. Even the French architect Jacques Gréber, whom Mackenzie King (once again prime minister) had spoken to about the beautification of downtown Ottawa and was thought to be a supporter of the idea to put the war memorial in Connaught Place, penned a report on the redevelopment of Ottawa in which he recommended the monument to the war dead be put in Major's Hill Park. However, after Mackenzie King pointed out that the park would not be as hospitable or accessible during the winter months, Gréber agreed and drew up plans for the Connaught Place site.\n\nThe bronzes were finally relocated to Ottawa in the summer of 1937, accompanied by Sydney, Percival, and Walter March. In December, after years of bickering, the contract for the construction of the pedestal and arch was awarded to E.G.M. Cape and Company of Montreal. The entire cenotaph was completed on 19 October 1938, after which the landscaping surrounding the memorial was laid out and installed by Toronto contractors A.W. Robertson Limited with consultation from Gréber. The cost by that point had risen to over $1,300,000. Conservative MP Alonzo Hyndman quipped: \"if those soldiers were to come back to-day and look at the memorial... and realize that $1,300,000 was being spent on it, while [their] sons and daughters... are walking the streets of Ottawa hungry, barefoot and without jobs... No wonder the sculptor has depicted the soldiers going through the arch with their heads hanging down, as though perplexed at what is going on.\" Still, the figures of peace and freedom were placed atop the granite arch on the same day the Munich Agreement was signed in Germany. Mackenzie King was optimistic: \"Canada will remember throughout her history, that these two symbolical figures found their place at the top of the National Memorial on September the 30th, the day of the signing of the 4-power agreement which averted another Great War.\"\n\nThe memorial was officially dedicated on 21 May 1939 by King George VI, the then reigning Canadian monarch, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth, Governor General the Lord Tweedsmuir, Mackenzie King, and an estimated 100,000 people, including some 12,000 veterans, attending. The site was decorated with banners depicting the heraldic elements of the Royal Arms of Canada. In his speech, the King focused on Canada having, through defending decency and democracy, reached nationhood among other Western countries. He said: \"On the battlefields of Europe and throughout the Dominion, there are many memorials to Canada's honoured dead. Today, in her own capital, Canada dedicates her national memorial. [It] speaks to the world of Canada's heart... Something deeper than chivalry is portrayed. It is the spontaneous response of the nation's conscience. The very soul of the nation is here revealed.\" After the formal ceremony, the King and his wife made their way to talk to gathered veterans. After doing so, the cheering crowd broke through military and police lines to \"greet them [the King and Queen] personally as fellow citizens\"; reporters noted that a king and queen had never before \"walked unescorted in the midst of such a multitude.\" It is thought that \"O Canada\" became the de facto national anthem after the King remained at attention during its playing at the dedication of the National War Memorial; George, though, was actually following a precedent set by his brother, Edward, the previous king of Canada, when he dedicated the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France in 1936.\n\nDespite the joyous environment, Mackenzie King felt the monument's allusions to the sacrifice required for peace and freedom would soon take on greater force: he and the King both were now certain another war was looming. They were proven correct and, after Canada became involved in further military conflict in and after September 1939, the symbolism of the National War Memorial came into question. While the monument in Ottawa was unofficially becoming a symbol of Canada's dead in all of the wars it fought in, the Royal Canadian Legion argued that new memorials should be created to mark the service of Canada's military in the Second World War and Korean War; the problem with \"The Response\", they argued, was \"the heroic figures of our present National War Memorial portray Canada's fighting men of the First World War so faithfully as to render it unsuitable as a memorial to our fallen in World War II and the Korean War.\" In 1947, Jacques Gréber, who continued to work on the development and beautification of Ottawa, designed a traditional monument to the Canadians who died in the Second World War, locating it in the Gatineau Hills, in a manner similar to the Vimy memorial in France and visible from downtown Ottawa. After veterans' groups complained the location would be difficult for tourists to reach, Gréber suggested placing the dates \"1939–1945\" on \"The Response\". Veterans found that unacceptable, as well, insisting that monument was to commemorate the dead of the First World War only. The federal government stated before the close of the Korean War that the East and West Memorial Buildings on Wellington Street would serve as a commemoration of the Canadian men and women who served in the Second World War; a lintel was built between the two structures and on it placed the inscription: \"ALL THESE WERE HONOURED IN THEIR GENERATIONS AND WERE THE GLORY OF THEIR TIMES\". Veterans' groups were again unsatisfied. In a brief given by the Royal Canadian Legion to the Cabinet on 10 November 1955, it was outlined that the organisation wanted a national cenotaph, that would \"honour the fallen of all wars\", placed in front of the Peace Tower.\n\nIn 1963, the matter became more prominent when the federal Cabinet announced a plan to have a national shrine of remembrance built at Nepean Point to house the Books of Remembrance and a cenotaph to commemorate \"the service and sacrifice of the veterans and war dead of all wars.\" Architects from Toronto and Quebec City were asked by the Cabinet to draw up plans for such a memorial complex and the announcement was made on 19 February 1963 by the Minister of Public Works, Davie Fulton, that the project would be completed for the Canadian Centennial in 1967. However, this plan never came to fruition, as it was denounced by some of the media, various organizations, veterans, a large number of Canadians, and eventually parliamentarians, even in the governing Liberal Party. The meaning of the war memorial in Confederation Square had shifted in the public consciousness; through its location in downtown Ottawa, renovations to Confederation Square to further highlight \"The Response\", and its constant use as a site for national Remembrance Day services (especially through the Second World War, as Canadians were dying overseas), it had come to represent in the Canadian collective consciousness all of Canada's war dead.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Legion requested in 1980 that the Crown rededicate the National War Memorial so as to formally recognise the sacrifices of those who had fought in the Second World and Korean Wars. Wishing to not repeat the confusion and problems around the national shrine of remembrance, the then Minister of Veterans Affairs, Dan MacDonald, almost immediately agreed to the proposal. The monument was re-dedicated on 29 May 1982 by Governor General Edward Schreyer, with the dates \"1939–1945\" and \"1950–1953\" added. the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was added before the monument in 2000 and dedicated by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson on 28 May of that year.\n\nDr. Michael Pilon, a retired Canadian Forces major, observed and photographed a group of young men urinating on the war memorial on the evening of Canada Day 2006. Two teenagers later issued apologies and undertook community service. Another 23-year-old man of Montreal was charged with mischief by the Ottawa Police Service, though he later claimed to have no memory of the event. The incident, along with the common sight of persons skateboarding and riding bicycles on the memorial's podium, prompted the posting of sentries at the site, though they are only present between 9 am and 5 pm from 9 April to 10 November.\n\nOn 22 October 2014, a gunman, armed with a rifle, shot at the sentries on duty at the tomb, fatally wounding one, Corporal Nathan Cirillo of The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's), before proceeding across the street and into the Centre Block parliament building. There, the gunman was killed in a firefight inside the building. Cirillo (and Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent) was mentioned by Governor General David Johnston in his speech at the Remembrance Day ceremony of that same year, when the Governor General and Anne, Princess Royal (who brought a message from Queen Elizabeth II), re-dedicated the monument once again. A plaque commemorating Corporal Cirillo's service at the War Memorial was dedicated at the site. The representation of the National War Memorial itself was also expanded to include to those who served in the Second Boer War, the War in Afghanistan, and to \"formally recognize all Canadians who served in the past, who serve today, and who will serve in the future.\" In that respect, the dates \"1899-1902\" (of the Boer War) and \"2001-2014\" (covering Canadian involvement in the Afghan War) were added to the monument.\n\nOn 15 May 1939, the Post Office Department issued a stamp called \"National Memorial\", designed by Herman Herbert Schwartz based on a picture engraved by Joseph Keller. A model of the war memorial also sits in the Royal Canadian Legion's Hall of Honour at the Canadian War Museum and the legion offers lapel pins depicting the monument.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1810163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810163", "title": "Iceland hotspot", "text": "Iceland hotspot\n\nThe Iceland hotspot is a hotspot which is partly responsible for the high volcanic activity which has formed the Iceland Plateau and the island of Iceland.\n\nIceland is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world, with eruptions occurring on average roughly every three years (in the 20th century there were 39 volcanic eruptions on and around Iceland). About a third of the basaltic lavas erupted in recorded history have been produced by Icelandic eruptions. Notable eruptions have included that of Eldgjá, a fissure of Katla, in 934 (the world's largest basaltic eruption ever witnessed), Laki in 1783 (the world's second largest), and several eruptions beneath ice caps, which have generated devastating glacial bursts, most recently in 2010 after the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull.\n\nIceland's location astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the Eurasian and North American Plates are moving apart, is partly responsible for this intense volcanic activity, but an additional cause is necessary to explain why Iceland is a substantial island while the rest of the ridge mostly consists of seamounts, with peaks below sea level.\n\nAs well as being a region of higher temperature than the surrounding mantle, it is believed to have a higher concentration of water. The presence of water in magma reduces the melting temperature, which may also play a role in enhancing Icelandic volcanism.\n\nThere is an ongoing discussion about whether the hotspot is caused by a deep mantle plume or originates at a much shallower depth. Recently, seismic tomography studies have found seismic wave speed anomalies under Iceland, consistent with a hot conduit 100 km across that extends to the lower mantle.\n\nSome geologists have questioned whether the Iceland hotspot has the same origin as other hotspots, such as the Hawaii hotspot. While the Hawaiian island chain and the Emperor Seamounts show a clear time-progressive volcanic track caused by the movement of the Pacific Plate over the Hawaiian hotspot, no such track can be seen at Iceland.\n\nIt is proposed that the line from Grímsvötn volcano to Surtsey shows the movement of the Eurasian Plate, and the line from Grímsvötn volcano to Reykjanes volcanic belt shows the movement of the North American Plate.\n\nThe Iceland plume is a postulated upwelling of anomalously hot rock in the Earth's mantle beneath Iceland. Its origin is thought to lie deep in the mantle, perhaps at the boundary between the core and the mantle at approximately 2,880 km depth. Opinions differ as to whether seismic studies have imaged such a structure. In this framework, the volcanism of Iceland is attributed to this plume, according to the theory of W. Jason Morgan.\n\nIt is believed that a mantle plume underlies Iceland, of which the hotspot is thought to be the surface expression, and that the presence of the plume enhances the volcanism already caused by plate separation. Additionally, flood basalts on the continental margins of Greenland and Norway, the oblique orientation of the Reykjanes Ridge segments to their spreading direction, and the enhanced igneous crustal thickness found along the southern Aegir and Kolbeinsey Ridges may be results of interaction between the plume and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The plume stem is believed to be quite narrow, perhaps 100 km across and extending down to at least 400–650 km beneath the Earth's surface, and possibly down to the core-mantle boundary, while the plume head may be > 1,000 km in diameter.\n\nIt is suggested that the lack of a time-progressive track of seamounts is due to the location of the plume beneath the thick Greenland craton for ~ 15 Myr after continental breakup, and the later entrenchment of the plume material into the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge following its formation.\n\nAccording to the plume model, the source of Icelandic volcanism lies deep beneath the center of the island. The earliest volcanic rocks attributed to the plume are found on both sides of the Atlantic. Their ages have been determined to lie between 58 and 64 million years. This coincides with the opening of the north Atlantic in the late Paleocene and early Eocene, which has led to suggestions that the arrival of the plume was linked to, and has perhaps contributed to, the breakup of the North Atlantic continent. In the framework of the plume hypothesis, the volcanism was caused by the flow of hot plume material initially beneath thick continental lithosphere and then beneath the lithosphere of the growing ocean basin as rifting proceeded. The exact position of the plume at that time is a matter of disagreement between scientists, as is whether the plume is thought to have ascended from the deep mantle only at that time or whether it is much older and also responsible for the old volcanism in northern Greenland, on Ellesmere Island, and at Alpha Ridge in the Arctic.\n\nAs the northern Atlantic opened to the east of Greenland during the Eocene, North America and Eurasia drifted apart; the Mid-Atlantic Ridge formed as an oceanic spreading center and a part of the submarine volcanic system of mid-oceanic ridges. The initial plume head may have been several thousand kilometers in diameter, and it erupted volcanic rocks on both sides of the present ocean basin to produce the North Atlantic Igneous Province. Upon further opening of the ocean and plate drift, the plume and the mid-Atlantic Ridge are postulated to have approached one another, and finally met. The excess magmatism that accompanied the transition from flood volcanism on Greenland, Ireland and Norway to present-day Icelandic activity was the result of ascent of the hot mantle source beneath progressively thinning lithosphere, according to the plume model, or a postulated unusually productive part of the mid-ocean ridge system. Some geologists have suggested that the Iceland plume could have been responsible for the Paleogene uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains by producing changes in the density of the lithosphere and asthenosphere during the opening of the North Atlantic. To the south the Paleogene uplift of the English chalklands that resulted in the formation of the Sub-Paleogene surface has also been attributed to the Iceland plume.\n\nAn extinct ridge exists in western Iceland, leading to the theory that the plume has shifted east with time. The oldest crust of Iceland is more than 20 million years old and was formed at an old oceanic spreading center in the Westfjords (Vestfirðir) region. The westward movement of the plates and the ridge above the plume and the strong thermal anomaly of the latter caused this old spreading center to cease 15 million years ago and lead to the formation of a new one in the area of today's peninsulas Skagi and Snæfellsnes; in the latter there is still some activity in the form of the Snæfellsjökull volcano. The spreading center, and hence the main activity, have shifted eastward again 7–9 million years ago and formed the current volcanic zones in the southwest (Reykjanes, Hofsjökull) and northeast (Tjörnes). Presently, a slow decrease of the activity in the northeast takes place, while the volcanic zone in the southeast (Katla, Vatnajökull), which was initiated 3 million years ago, develops. The reorganisation of the plate boundaries in Iceland has also been attributed to microplate tectonics.\n\nThe weak visibility of the postulated plume in tomographic images of the lower mantle and the geochemical evidence for eclogite in the mantle source have led to the theory that Iceland is not underlain by a mantle plume at all, but that the volcanism there results from processes related to plate tectonics and is restricted to the upper mantle.\n\nAccording to one of those models, a large chunk of the subducted plate of a former ocean has survived in the uppermost mantle for several hundred million years, and its oceanic crust now causes excessive melt generation and the observed volcanism. This model, however, is not backed by dynamical calculations, nor is it exclusively required by the data, and it also leaves unanswered questions concerning the dynamical and chemical stability of such a body over that long period or the thermal effect of such massive melting.\n\nAnother model proposes that the upwelling in the Iceland region is driven by lateral temperature gradients between the suboceanic mantle and the neighbouring Greenland craton and therefore also restricted to the upper 200–300 km of the mantle. However, this convection mechanism is probably not strong enough under the conditions prevailing in the north Atlantic, with respect to the spreading rate, and it does not offer a simple explanation for the observed geoid anomaly.\n\nInformation about the structure of Earth's deep interior can be acquired only indirectly by geophysical and geochemical methods. For the investigation of postulated plumes, gravimetric, geoid and in particular seismological methods along with geochemical analyses of erupted lavas have proven especially useful. Numerical models of the geodynamical processes attempt to merge these observations into a consistent general picture.\n\nAn important method for imaging large-scale structures in Earth's interior is seismic tomography, by which the area under consideration is \"illuminated\" from all sides with seismic waves from earthquakes from as many different directions as possible; these waves are recorded with a network of seismometers. The size of the network is crucial for the extent of the region which can be imaged reliably. For the investigation of the Iceland Plume, both global and regional tomography have been used; in the former, the whole mantle is imaged at relatively low resolution using data from stations all over the world, whereas in the latter, a denser network only on Iceland images the mantle down to 400–450 km depth with higher resolution.\n\nRegional studies from the 1990s and 2000s show that there is a low seismic-wave-speed anomaly beneath Iceland, but opinion is divided as to whether it continues deeper than the mantle transition zone at roughly 600 km depth. The velocities of seismic waves are reduced by up to 3% (P waves) and more than 4% (S waves), respectively. These values are consistent with a small percentage of partial melt, a high magnesium content of the mantle, or elevated temperature. It is not possible to unambiguously separate out which effect causes the observed velocity reduction.\n\nNumerous studies have addressed the geochemical signature of the lavas present on Iceland and in the north Atlantic. The resulting picture is consistent in several important respects. For instance, it is not contested that the source of the volcanism in the mantle is chemically and petrologically heterogeneous: it contains not only peridotite, the principal mantle rock type, but also eclogite, a rock type that originates from the basalt in subducted slabs and is more easily fusible than peridotite. The origin of the latter is assumed to be metamorphosed, very old oceanic crust which sank into the mantle several hundreds of millions of years ago during the subduction of an ocean, then upwelled from deep within the mantle.\n\nStudies using the major and trace-element compositions of Icelandic volcanics showed that the source of present-day volcanism was about 100 °C greater than that of the source of mid-ocean ridge basalts.\n\nThe variations in the concentrations of trace elements such as helium, lead, strontium, neodymium, and others show clearly that Iceland is compositionally distinct from the rest of the north Atlantic. For instance, the ratio of He-3 and He-4 has a pronounced maximum on Iceland, which correlates well with geophysical anomalies, and the decrease of this and other geochemical signatures with increasing distance from Iceland indicate that the extent of the compositional anomaly reaches about 1,500 km along the Reykjanes Ridge and at least 300 km along the Kolbeinsey Ridge. Depending on which elements are considered and how large the area covered is, one can identify up to six different mantle components, which are not all present in any single location.\n\nFurthermore, some studies show that the amount of water dissolved in mantle minerals is two to six times higher in the Iceland region than in undisturbed parts of the mid-oceanic ridges, where it is regarded to lie at about 150 parts per million. The presence of such a large amount of water in the source of the lavas would tend to lower its melting point and make it more productive for a given temperature.\n\nThe north Atlantic is characterized by strong, large-scale anomalies of the gravity field and the geoid. The geoid rises up to 70 m above the geodetic reference ellipsoid in an approximately circular area with a diameter of several hundred kilometers. In the context of the plume hypothesis, this has been explained by the dynamic effect of the upwelling plume which bulges up the surface of the Earth. Furthermore, the plume and the thickened crust cause a positive gravity anomaly of about 60 mGal (=0.0006 m/s²) (free-air).\nSince the mid-1990s several attempts have been made to explain the observations with numerical geodynamical models of mantle convection. The purpose of these calculations was, among other things, to resolve the paradox that a broad plume with a relatively low temperature anomaly is in better agreement with the observed crustal thickness, topography, and gravity than a thin, hot plume, which has been invoked to explain the seismological and geochemical observations. The most recent models prefer a plume that is 180–200 °C hotter than the surrounding mantle and has a stem with a radius of ca. 100 km. Such temperatures have not yet been confirmed by petrology, however.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1810164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810164", "title": "Pressure suit", "text": "Pressure suit\n\nA pressure suit is a protective suit worn by high-altitude pilots who may fly at altitudes where the air pressure is too low for an unprotected person to survive, even breathing pure oxygen at positive pressure. Such suits may be either full-pressure (i.e. a space suit) or partial-pressure (as used by aircrew). Partial-pressure suits work by providing mechanical counter-pressure to assist breathing at altitude.\n\nThe region from sea level to around is known as the physiological-efficient zone. Oxygen levels are usually high enough for humans to function without supplemental oxygen and decompression sickness is rare.\n\nThe physiological-deficient zone extends from to about . There is an increased risk of problems such as hypoxia, trapped-gas dysbarism (where gas trapped in the body expands), and evolved-gas dysbarism (where dissolved gases such as nitrogen may form in the tissues, i.e. decompression sickness). Above approximately oxygen-rich breathing mixture is required to approximate the oxygen available in the lower atmosphere, while above oxygen must be under positive pressure. Above , respiration is not possible because the pressure at which the lungs excrete carbon dioxide (approximately 87 mmHg) exceeds outside air pressure. Above , also known as the Armstrong limit, fluids in the throat and lungs will boil away. Generally, 100% oxygen is used to maintain an equivalent altitude of .\n\nGenerally, pressure suits work by either indirectly compressing the human body, or directly compressing it.\n\nIndirect compression is typically done by enclosing the body in a gas envelope. For this type, design effort focuses on compressing and containing the gas, at an equal pressure around the body as the wearer moves, and not having the gas pressure or the enclosing suit envelope restricting body movement of the wearer.\n\nMaintaining constant gas pressure as the wearer moves is difficult, because the internal volume of a simple construction inflatable suit will change when body joints are flexed. The gas pressure constantly tries to push the wearer's body into a position where the suit has been inflated to its maximum air volume. Moving against this gas pressure can be very difficult, and be very exhausting for the suit wearer, limiting the amount of work that can be performed using the suit.\n\nIndirect compression suits generally require complex ribbed mechanical structures at the joints, which create flexible but inelastic folds or pockets in the skin of the suit that act to maintain a constant air volume in the suit as the wearer moves. These pockets exist on both sides of a flexible joint and are designed to work together in tandem, so that when a joint is flexed, the folds on one side of the joint will compress and shrink in volume, while the folds on the opposite side will relax and expand in volume. The ribbed structures are usually braced with wire cables or cloth straps to limit their motion and prevent unusual flexing modes that may chafe against the user's body. The wire hinge cables also restrain the complex folds, which if released could unfurl and extend to be more than a meter longer than the wearer's body.\n\nThese constant-volume joint structures greatly reduce fatigue of the wearer so that they do not have to constantly struggle against the suit pressure.\n\nDirect compression involves applying pressure directly to the human body using the suit material, usually without any additional gas envelope around the wearer, which is instead provided by an outer rigid cabin structure enclosing the person.\n\nOne method used for this is known as a capstan suit, which uses a compressible inflatable tube known as the capstan, enclosed by alternating fabric strips that wrap around the air tube and are attached to an inelastic fabric that closely fits the shape of the wearer's body.\n\nTo provide a custom tight form-fit to the wearer's body, there are groups of laces along the length of each limb. Zippers may also run the length of a limb to allow for room to get into the suit. To apply pressure, the capstan tube is pressurized which expands in diameter and applies pressure to the fabric strips. The strips then pull the suit material laterally tighter around the wearer's body.\n\nA problem with this design is that the suit fabric is unable to directly provide pressure to the human body in areas with a surface that cures inward, away from the suit fabric. Locations with concave skin surfaces are in the armpit, behind the knees, the front and back of the crotch region, and along the spine.\n\nInflatable air bladder structures or molded rigid expanded foam may be used, which fit into these cavity spaces to provide direct skin pressure where the suit material is unable to provide that contact directly.\n\nPartial pressure suits only pressurize certain parts of the body. They can only provide protection up to a certain altitude. They do not provide protection for extended periods of time at low ambient pressure.\n\nFull pressure suits pressurize the entire body. These suits have no altitude limit.\n\nThe human body can briefly survive the hard vacuum of space unprotected, despite contrary depictions in much popular science fiction. Human flesh expands to about twice its size in such conditions, giving the visual effect of a body builder rather than an overfilled balloon. Consciousness is retained for up to 15 seconds as the effects of oxygen starvation set in. No snap freeze effect occurs because all heat must be lost through thermal radiation or the evaporation of liquids, and the blood does not boil because it remains pressurized within the body. The greatest danger is in attempting to hold one's breath before exposure, as the subsequent explosive decompression can damage the lungs. These effects have been confirmed through various accidents (including in very high altitude conditions, outer space and training vacuum chambers).\n\nHuman skin does not need to be protected from vacuum and is gas-tight by itself. Instead it only needs to be mechanically compressed to retain its normal shape. This can be accomplished with a tight-fitting elastic body suit and a helmet for containing breathing gases, known as a space activity suit.\n\nIn USSR, the first full pressure suit was designed by engineer Ciann Downes in Leningrad in 1931. The CH-1 was a simple pressure-tight suit with a helmet which did not have joints, thus requiring substantial force to move the arms and legs when pressurised. This was remedied in later suits. Work on full pressure suits was carried out during 1936-41 by the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI), with similar work being carried out by the Gromov Flight Research Institute (LII) after World War II. The LII produced four experimental full pressure suits for aircrews, and in 1959 began work on full pressure suits for spaceflight. Chertovskiy used the name skafander for full pressure suits, from the French \"scaphandre\" (\"diving suit\"); \"skafander\" has since become the term used by Russians to refer to standard diving dresses or space suits.\n\nIn 1931, American Mark Ridge became obsessed with breaking the world altitude record in an open gondola balloon. Recognizing that the flight would require specialised protective clothing, he visited the UK in 1933 where he met with Scottish physiologist John Scott Haldane, who had published a concept for a fabric full pressure suit in the 1920s. The two sought the assistance of Robert Henry Davis of Siebe Gorman, the inventor of the Davis Escape Set, and with Haldane's and Davis' resources a prototype suit was constructed. Ridge tested it in a low-pressure chamber to a simulated altitude of 50,000 feet. However, he received no support for further work and never made his attempt on the world record.\n\nOn 28 September 1936 Squadron Leader F.R.D. Swain of the Royal Air Force set the official world altitude record at 49,967 feet in a Bristol Type 138 wearing a similar suit.\n\nIn 1934, aviator Wiley Post, working with Russell S. Colley of the B.F. Goodrich Company, produced the world's first practical pressure suit. The suit's body had three layers: long underwear, a rubber air pressure bladder, and an outer suit of rubberized parachute fabric which was attached to a frame with arm and leg joints that allowed Post to operate aircraft controls and to walk to and from the aircraft. Attached to the frame were pigskin gloves, rubber boots, and an aluminum and plastic helmet with a removable faceplate that could accommodate earphones and a throat microphone. In the first flight using the suit on September 5, 1934, Post reached an altitude of 40,000 feet above Chicago, and in later flights reached 50,000 feet.\n\nIn the US, a large amount of effort was put into the development of pressure suits during World War II. While B.F. Goodrich led the field, other companies involved in such research included the Arrowhead Rubber Co., Goodyear, and US Rubber. The University of Minnesota worked with Bell Aircraft and the US National Bureau of Standards. The Bureau of Standards and the University of California acted as clearing houses to distribute information to all the companies involved. No effective fully mobile pressure suits were produced in World War II but the effort provided a valuable basis for later development.\nFollowing the war, the Cold War caused continued funding of aviation development, which included high altitude, high speed research such as NACA's X-1. James Henry of the University of Southern California devised a partial pressure suit using an oxygen mask to provide pressurised oxygen, with gas pressure also inflating rubber tubes called capstans to tighten the suit and provide sufficient mechanical counterpressure to just balance the breathing pressure necessary to prevent hypoxia at a particular altitude. The David Clark Company supplied technical support and resources, and a prototype suit was tested to a simulated 90,000 feet at Wright Field in 1946. Henry's design was subsequently developed by the David Clark Company into the S-1 and T-1 flight suit used by X-1 pilots. The X-1 was succeeded by the Douglas Skyrocket, whose objective was to exceed Mach 2, and an improved pressure suit was required. David Clark won the contract in 1951 with their first full pressure suit, the Model 4 Full Pressure Suit; it was first flown in 1953 by USMC aviator Marion E. Carl who became the first US military aviator to wear a full pressure suit, at the same time setting an unofficial worlds altitude record in the Skyrocket.\nUS requirements for high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft such as the U-2, and fighters to intercept high-altitude Soviet aircraft caused the US Navy to be tasked with the development of a full pressure suit in the 1950s. Working with B.F. Goodrich and Arrowhead Rubber, the USN produced a series of designs which culminated in the Goodrich Mk III and IV. While intended for aircraft use, the Mk IV was later used by NASA with modifications for Project Mercury as the Navy Mark V. At the same time, David Clark won the contract to produce suits for the X-15 project; its XMC-2 suits qualified as the first US spacesuits.\n\nThe RAF Institute of Aviation Medicine and the Royal Aircraft Establishment developed a partial-pressure helmet which was used with a capstan type suit purchased from the US. It was worn by Walter Gibb and his navigator to set a world altitude record on 29 August 1955 in an English Electric Canberra. However, evaluation of the suit showed that it encumbered the wearer and did not integrate well with RAF escape systems. Instead, the RAF IAM proposed a minimal-coverage suit which would provide \"get-me-down\" protection. The RAF never issued a partial-pressure suit, preferring instead to use anti-g trousers in conjunction with pressure jerkins (which applied mechanical counter-pressure to the wearer's chest).\n\n\n"}

The other two Borough of Chesterfield wards (Barrow Hill and New Whittington; Lowgates and Woodthorpe) fall within the neighbouring North East Derbyshire seat. Boundary changes before the 2010 general election, when the Mid Derbyshire constituency was created, meant that Chesterfield lost New Whittington to North East Derbyshire but otherwise retained its shape.\n\nThe town of Chesterfield lies just outside the Peak District southwest of Sheffield. Its best known landmark is the Church of St Mary and All Saints, commonly known as the Crooked Spire. The constituency borders the constituencies of Bolsover and Derbyshire North East.\n\nChesterfield has mainly been a Labour seat, with periods when it has been held by other parties; it was gained by the Liberal Democrats in 2001 and held by them until 2010. Chesterfield was safe seat for Labour from 1935 until 2001.

The former Labour cabinet minister Eric Varley held the seat from October 1964 to January 1984, and was succeeded by his ex-government colleague Tony Benn, who held the seat following a by-election in March 1984. He remained the town's MP until his retirement from the House of Commons in 2001, when he famously remarked that his decision was taken to \"spend more time on politics\". Benn had been a Labour Cabinet Minister between 1966–70 and 1974-1979, while Varley was in the Wilson and Callaghan cabinets in the latter period. Paul Holmes gained the seat for the Liberal Democrats at the 2001 general election, the party's first Commons seat in the East Midlands, but were narrowly defeated at the 2010 by the Labour candidate Toby Perkins, one of only three seats the Labour Party gained at the 2010 general election.

The first of these, his Ph.D. research under the supervision of Stephen Wurm, was published as \"The Ndu languages\" (1965), and established the existence of this closely related group of languages. In subsequent surveys, Laycock found the Ndu languages were part of a larger language family extending through the middle and upper Sepik valley (the \"Sepik subphylum\"), and in 1973 he proposed that these languages formed part of a Sepik–Ramu phylum. This remained the general consensus in the linguistic world for over 30 years. While more recent work by William A.

{"id": "1810201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810201", "title": "Biclustering", "text": "Biclustering\n\nBiclustering, block clustering\nThe term was first introduced by Boris Mirkin to name a technique introduced many years earlier, in 1972, by J. A. Hartigan.\n\nGiven a set of formula_1 samples represented by an formula_2-dimensional feature vector, the entire dataset can be represented as formula_1 rows in formula_2 columns (i.e., an formula_5 matrix). The biclustering algorithm generates biclusters – a subset of rows which exhibit similar behavior across a subset of columns, or vice versa.\n\nBiclustering was originally introduced by J. A. Hartigan in 1972. The term biclustering was later used by Mirkin. This algorithm was not generalized until 2000 when Y. Cheng and G. M. Church proposed a biclustering algorithm based on variance and applied it to biological gene expression data. Their paper is still the most important literature in the gene expression biclustering field.\n\nIn 2001 and 2003, I.S. Dhillon put forward two algorithms applying biclustering to files and words. One version was based on bipartite spectral graph partitioning. The other was based on information theory. Dhillon assumed the loss of mutual information during biclustering was equal to the Kullback–Leibler-distance (KL-distance) between P and Q. P means the distribution of files and feature words before biclustering. Q is the distribution after biclustering. KL-distance is for measuring the difference between two random distributions. KL = 0 when the two distributions are the same and KL increases as the difference increases. Thus, the aim of the algorithm was to find the minimum KL-distance between P and Q. In 2004, Arindam Banerjee used a weighted-Bregman distance instead of KL-distance to design a biclustering algorithm which was suitable for any kind of matrix, unlike the KL-distance algorithm.\n\nTo cluster more than two types of objects, in 2005, Bekkerman expanded the mutual information in Dhillon's theorem from a single pair into multiple pairs.\n\nThe complexity of the biclustering problem depends on the exact problem formulation, and particularly on the merit function used to evaluate the quality of a given bicluster. However most interesting variants of this problem are NP-complete. NP-complete have two conditions. In the simple case that there is only element \"a\" either 0 or 1 in the binary matrix A, a bicluster is equal to a biclique in the corresponding bipartite graph. The maximum size bicluster is equivalent to maximum edge biclique in bipartite graph. In the complex case, the element in matrix A is used to compute the quality of a given bicluster and solve the more restricted version of the problem. It requires either large computational effort or the use of lossy heuristics to short-circuit the calculation.\n\nDifferent biclustering algorithms have different definitions of bicluster.\n\nThey are:\n\n\n1.Bicluster with constant values\n\nWhen a biclustering algorithm tries to find a constant bicluster, the normal way for it is to reorder the rows and columns of the matrix so it can group together similar rows/columns and find biclusters with similar values. This method is OK when the data is tidy. But as the data can be noisy most of the times, so it can’t satisfy us. More sophisticated methods should be used.\nA perfect constant bicluster is a matrix(I,J) where all values a(i,j) are equal to μ. In real data, a(i,j) can be seen as n(i,j) +μ where n(i,j) is the noise. \nAccording to Hartigan’s algorithm, by splitting the original data matrix into a set of biclusters, variance is used to compute constant biclusters. So, a perfect bicluster is a matrix with variance zero. Also, in order to prevent the partitioning of the data matrix into biclusters with only one row and one column, Hartigan assumes that there are K biclusters within the data matrix. When the data matrix is partitioned into K biclusters, the algorithm ends.\n\n2.Biclusters with constant values on rows or columns\n\nThis kind of biclusters can’t be evaluated just by variance of its values. To finish the identification, the columns and the rows should be normalized at first. There are other algorithms, without normalization step, can find biclusters have rows and columns with different approaches.\n\n3.Biclusters with coherent values\n\nFor biclusters with coherent values on rows and columns, an overall improvement over the algorithms for biclusters with constant values on rows or on columns should be considered. \nThat means a sophisticated algorithm is needed. This algorithm may contain analysis of variance between groups, using co-variance between both rows and columns. In Cheng and Church's theorem, a bicluster is defined as a subset of rows and columns with almost the same score. The similarity score is used to measure the coherence of rows and columns.\n\nThe relationship between these cluster models and other types of clustering such as correlation clustering is discussed in.\n\nThere are many biclustering algorithms developed for bioinformatics, including: block clustering, CTWC (Coupled Two-Way Clustering), ITWC (Interrelated Two-Way Clustering), δ-bicluster, δ-pCluster, δ-pattern, FLOC, OPC, Plaid Model, OPSMs (Order-preserving submatrixes), Gibbs, SAMBA (Statistical-Algorithmic Method for Bicluster Analysis), Robust Biclustering Algorithm (RoBA), Crossing Minimization, cMonkey, PRMs, DCC, LEB (Localize and Extract Biclusters), QUBIC (QUalitative BIClustering), BCCA (Bi-Correlation Clustering Algorithm) BIMAX, ISA and FABIA (Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition), runibic,\nand recently proposed hybrid method EBIC (Evolutionary-based biclustering), which was shown to detect multiple patterns with very high accuracy.\n\nBiclustering algorithms have also been proposed and used in other application fields under the names coclustering, bidimensional clustering, and subspace clustering.\n\nGiven the known importance of discovering local patterns in time-series data, recent proposals have addressed the biclustering problem in the specific case of time series gene expression data. In this case, the interesting biclusters can be restricted to those with contiguous columns. This restriction leads to a tractable problem and enables the development of efficient exhaustive enumeration algorithms such as CCC-Biclustering and \"e\"-CCC-Biclustering. \nThe approximate patterns in CCC-Biclustering algorithms allow a given number of errors, per gene, relatively to an expression profile representing the expression pattern in the bicluster. The e-CCC-Biclustering algorithm uses approximate expressions to find and report all maximal CCC-Biclusters by a discretized matrix A and efficient string processing techniques.\n\nThese algorithms find and report all maximal biclusters with coherent and contiguous columns with perfect/approximate expression patterns, in time linear/polynomial which is obtained by manipulating a discretized version of original expression matrix in the size of the time series gene expression matrix using efficient string processing techniques based on suffix trees. These algorithms are also applied to solve problems and sketch the analysis of computational complexity.\n\nSome recent algorithms have attempted to include additional support for biclustering rectangular matrices in the form of other datatypes, including cMonkey.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate about how to judge the results of these methods, as biclustering allows overlap between clusters and some algorithms allow the exclusion of hard-to-reconcile columns/conditions. Not all of the available algorithms are deterministic and the analyst must pay attention to the degree to which results represent stable minima. Because this is an unsupervised classification problem, the lack of a gold standard makes it difficult to spot errors in the results. One approach is to utilize multiple biclustering algorithms, with majority or super-majority voting amongst them deciding the best result. Another way is to analyse the quality of shifting and scaling patterns in biclusters. Biclustering has been used in the domain of text mining (or classification) where it is popularly known as co-clustering \n. Text corpora are represented in a vectorial form as a matrix D whose rows denote the documents and whose columns denote the words in the dictionary. Matrix elements D denote occurrence of word j in document i. Co-clustering algorithms are then applied to discover blocks in D that correspond to a group of documents (rows) characterized by a group of words(columns).\n\nTest clustering can solve the high-dimensional sparse problem, which means clustering text and words at the same time. When clustering text, we need to think about not only the words information, but also the information of words clusters that was composed by words. Then according to similarity of feature words in the text, will eventually cluster the feature words. This is called co-clustering. There are two advantages of co-clustering: one is clustering the test based on words clusters can extremely decrease the dimension of clustering, it can also appropriate to measure the distance between the tests. Second is mining more useful information and can get the corresponding information in test clusters and words clusters. This corresponding information can be used to describe the type of texts and words, at the same time, the result of words clustering can be also used to text mining and information retrieval.\n\nSeveral approaches have been proposed based on the information contents of the resulting blocks: matrix-based approaches such as SVD and BVD, and graph-based approaches. Information-theoretic algorithms iteratively assign each row to a cluster of documents and each column to a cluster of words such that the mutual information is maximized. Matrix-based methods focus on the decomposition of matrices into blocks such that the error between the original matrix and the regenerated matrices from the decomposition is minimized. Graph-based methods tend to minimize the cuts between the clusters. Given two groups of documents d and d, the number of cuts can be measured as the number of words that occur in documents of groups d and d.\n\nMore recently (Bisson and Hussain) have proposed a new approach of using the similarity between words and the similarity between documents to co-cluster the matrix. Their method (known as χ-Sim, for cross similarity) is based on finding document-document similarity and word-word similarity, and then using classical clustering methods such as hierarchical clustering. Instead of explicitly clustering rows and columns alternately, they consider higher-order occurrences of words, inherently taking into account the documents in which they occur. Thus, the similarity between two words is calculated based on the documents in which they occur and also the documents in which \"similar\" words occur. The idea here is that two documents about the same topic do not necessarily use the same set of words to describe it but a subset of the words and other similar words that are characteristic of that topic. This approach of taking higher-order similarities takes the latent semantic structure of the whole corpus into consideration with the result of generating a better clustering of the documents and words.\n\nIn text databases, for a document collection defined by a document by term D matrix (of size m by n, m: number of documents, n: number of terms) the cover-coefficient based clustering methodology yields the same number of clusters both for documents and terms (words) using a double-stage probability experiment. According to the cover coefficient concept number of clusters can also be roughly estimated by the following formula formula_6 where t is the number of non-zero entries in D. Note that in D each row and each column must contain at least one non-zero element.\n\nIn contrast to other approaches, FABIA is a multiplicative model that assumes realistic non-Gaussian signal distributions with heavy tails. FABIA utilizes well understood model selection techniques like variational approaches and applies the Bayesian framework. The generative framework allows FABIA to determine the information content of each bicluster to separate spurious biclusters from true biclusters.\n\n\n\n"}

He promoted colonization in Newfoundland, but with mixed success.\n\nHe was the son of Walter Vaughan (died 1598) and was born at Golden Grove (Gelli Aur), Llanfihangel Aberbythych, Carmarthenshire, Wales – the estate of his father, through whom he was descended from an ancient prince of Powys. He was brother to John Vaughan, 1st Earl of Carbery (1572−1634) and Henry Vaughan (1587−1659), a well-known Royalist leader in the English Civil War. William was educated at Jesus College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 4 February 1592, and graduated BA on 1 March 1595, MA on 16 November 1597. He supplicated for the law degree of BCL on 3 December 1600, but before taking its examination he went abroad, travelled in France and Italy, and visited Vienna, where he proceeded LlD, being incorporated at Oxford on 23 June 1605.\n\nIn 1616 he bought a grant of land, the southern Avalon Peninsula (from Calvert to Placentia Bay) of the island of Newfoundland, from the London and Bristol Company. In 1617 he sent Welsh colonists to Renews to establish a permanent colony, which he called Cambriol; it eventually failed. The colonists were ill-equipped, without an experienced leader, and had built for themselves mere shacks for shelter for the winter. In 1618 Vaughan sent out a second batch of settlers under the command of Richard Whitbourne, whom he appointed governor for life of the undertaking.\n\nBy 1619 Vaughan signed over part of his grant to Henry Cary. Vaughan's brother had convinced him to also to give up a portion of his tract to George Calvert, the area around Ferryland. In this area George Calvert established his Colony of Avalon. Vaughan retained the southern portion of his tract, determined by a line drawn from Renews to Placentia Bay, an area that included Trepassey. Further attempts to colonize Trepassey on two occasions had also failed. After the return of Whitbourne, Vaughan visited his colony in 1622, and returned to England in 1625, bringing with him two works ready for publication.\n\nVaughan apparently paid another visit to Cambriol, but his plans for its prosperity were foiled by the severe winters. In 1628 he transferred his interests to the colony of Virginia. He died at his house of Torcoed, Carmarthenshire, in August 1641. In his will he gave instructions that he should be buried \"without vaine pomp in the Churchyard of Llangendeirne\". The location of his grave in the churchyard is unknown, but in a service held in Llangyndeyrn church on 31 October 1987 a memorial tablet to Vaughan was unveiled by George Noakes, Archbishop of Wales at the time.\n\nHis chief work is \"The Golden Grove\" (1600), under the pseudonym \"Orpheus junior\", a general guide to morals, politics and literature, in which the manners of the time are severely criticized, plays being denounced as folly and wickedness. The section in praise of poetry borrows much from earlier writers on the subject.\n\n\"The Golden Fleece... transported from Cambriol Colchis, by Orpheus junior\" (1626) is the most interesting of his other works. A long and fantastic prose allegory, it demonstrates \"the Errours of Religion, the Vices and Decayes of the Kingdome, and lastly the wayes to get wealth, and to restore Trading\" through the colonization of Newfoundland. After returning from Newfoundland he published two devotional works,\"The Church from the Time of our Saviour to 1640\" and \"The Soules Exercise\".\n\n\n"}

Standing trial before the prefect Eustratius, she bravely confessed herself a Christian. The prefect asked why she had not married, pointing out that she was of a noble family and beautiful and could have her choice of husbands. She replied that she had dedicated herself to God, and had resolved to remain a virgin for the name of Christ.\n\nEustratius had her imprisoned, giving her time to reconsider, and he threatened to have her taken to a brothel if she persisted in her disobedience. Three days later, Theodora was brought again to trial, but remained resolute.\n\nAccordingly, Theodora was taken to a brothel. Dissolute youths began to argue which of them should be the first to have her. When the Christian Didymus, dressed in soldier's garb, entered and chased the profligates out. Didymus exchanged clothes with her, and she escaped. When a man came to despoil the virgin, Didymus revealed himself. Didymus was taken prisoner and brought to the prefect, where he was condemned to death. Saint Ambrose says that Theodora could not allow her savior to die alone and that she joined Didymus before Proculus.\n\nDidymus and, according to Ambrose, Theodora were beheaded. Didymus's body was burned. They are not included in the Roman Martyrology, the official list of saints of the Roman Catholic Church. The story of Theodora and Didymus is almost identical to that of Saints Antonia and Alexander.\n\nThe theme of the story might reflect the institution of religious prostitution, prevalent in the ancient Middle East, as remembered in a highly-disapproving Christian tradition.\n\nPierre Corneille wrote in 1645 a tragedy \"Theodore, virgin and martyr\", based on this story, but he transferred it to Antioch.

In total, Harford's transfer fees over his playing career amounted to over £2.25 million.\n\nAs well as his non-playing roles at Luton, Harford was manager of Rotherham United in 2005 and has been caretaker manager of both Nottingham Forest and Queens Park Rangers. He has also held assistant manager positions at Colchester United, MK Dons and Millwall, and coaching roles at Wimbledon and Swindon Town.\n\nBorn in Sunderland, Harford joined Lincoln City in 1977. He was at Lincoln for just over three years before he moved on to Newcastle United in a £180,000 transfer. After just 19 appearances and eight months at Newcastle, Harford moved on again, this time to Bristol City for £160,000 in August 1981. Seven months later, Harford had impressed enough to gain a move to First Division club Birmingham City for £100,000 in March 1982.\n\nHarford continued to impress at Birmingham and in December 1984, then Luton Town manager David Pleat added Harford to his side for a £250,000 fee. In his time at Luton, Harford earned himself two England caps, making his international debut against Israel in February 1988. He also featured against Denmark in a September 1988 fixture.\n\nHarford was part of the Luton side that won the League Cup in 1988 against Arsenal. He also scored in the final the following year as Luton went down 3–1 to Nottingham Forest. He is a fan favourite of Luton supporters and is often voted as the club's best ever player, such is the regard he is held in at Kenilworth Road. He was a key player at Luton until his transfer to Derby County in January 1990 for £450,000. Even after his transfer, Harford managed to help the Hatters in their fight against relegation, as in the last game of the season Derby County played Luton Town, with Luton needing a win to stay up. Harford managed to head the ball from outside his own six-yard box, past England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, into his own net as Luton won the game and avoided relegation. Several years later, Harford admitted that the own goal was deliberate. Harford then rejoined the Hatters in September 1991 for £325,000, despite competition from Manchester United. Harford scored 12 goals from 29 league games as the Hatters were relegated from what was about to become the Premier League.\n\nUnited manager Alex Ferguson has since said that he regrets not signing Harford, as he feels that it would have made a positive difference to their form in the 1991–92 season, when a shortage of goals in the second half of the league campaign cost them the title.\n\nFollowing Luton's relegation, Harford moved on again, this time to Chelsea for £300,000 in August 1992. During his time at Chelsea, he scored the club's first goal in the Premier League, finding the net in the 84th minute of his debut at home to Oldham Athletic, who swiftly responded with an equaliser to force a 1–1 draw. Despite being the top scorer at the club in the 1992–93 season, he was sold in March 1993 to his hometown club Sunderland in a £250,000 transfer deal.\n\nHarford lasted just four months at Sunderland before moving to Coventry City for £200,000 in July 1993. Despite being at the club for 13 months, Harford only made one league appearance as a fifteenth-minute substitute against Newcastle. He scored the winning goal, but never featured for the club again owing to a back injury. He had been issued with the number 9 shirt with the introduction of squad numbers in the FA Premier League for the 1993–94 season.\n\nIn August 1994, Harford made his last transfer as a player, joining Joe Kinnear's Wimbledon side for £50,000. Harford would go on to make 60 appearances for the Dons, many in midfield, and scored his last professional goal at the age of 38 years and 34 days against West Ham United in 1997, before he retired and moved into a coaching role at Selhurst Park.\n\nHarford was capped twice for England at senior level. Both of his appearances came in 1988. His first came on 17 February 1988 in a goalless friendly draw with Israel. His second came on 14 September 1988 in a 1–0 friendly win over Denmark, but he failed to get onto the scoresheet. He was a Luton Town player at this time.\n\nMaking his move into coaching with Wimbledon, Harford developed his skills before following his old manager Joe Kinnear back to Luton Town following Luton's relegation to the Third Division in 2001. In his role as first-team coach, Harford helped mastermind the successful season of 2001–02, which saw Luton storm to promotion back to the Second Division. Following the 2002–03 season, the club was sold to a new consortium, and Harford and Kinnear were then surprisingly sacked. Harford was to be offered his job back, but refused to work under the new board.\n\nAfter the new Luton owners were forced out by supporters, Harford returned to the club in a joint role as Director of Football, with responsibility for player recruitment, as well as first-team coach. Harford helped new manager Mike Newell to a 10th-place finish, and his value was proved by then Nottingham Forest manager Joe Kinnear's attempts to make him his assistant manager at Forest. Harford initially rejected the move but in November 2004, despite the contrasting fortunes both sides were displaying – with Forest fighting relegation in the Championship and Luton leading League One – Harford moved onto the City Ground.\n\nKinnear was to last only a few more weeks at Forest before a poor run of form forced him to leave the club. Harford was then appointed caretaker manager, and he performed admirably despite the problems at the club. Gary Megson was then appointed full-time manager in January 2005 and Harford subsequently left the club.\n\nOut of work for only a short while, Harford teamed up with Andy King at Swindon Town in February 2005 in a deal that was due to run until the end of the 2004–05 season. In April 2005 however, Harford was appointed the new manager of Rotherham United, whose relegation from the Championship at the end of the 2004–05 season had already been confirmed. Harford had an impressive start to his managerial career, but was sacked in December after a run of 17 games without a win. He was replaced by Alan Knill. Harford finished the season at Millwall, coaching the strikers at the club before their relegation from the Championship at the end of the 2005–06 season.\n\nHarford then joined his former Derby County teammate Geraint Williams at Colchester United in the summer of 2006, becoming the club's assistant manager. Harford was linked with another return to Kenilworth Road following the sacking of Mike Newell in March 2007, but the job instead went to Kevin Blackwell. Harford left Colchester to become assistant manager at Queens Park Rangers in June 2007, before becoming caretaker after the departure of John Gregory. Harford left QPR after the appointment of Luigi De Canio.\n\nIn January 2008, Harford was unveiled as the new manager of struggling and cash-strapped Luton Town until the end of the season. He committed to stay at Luton despite the club being docked 30 points in the break before the 2008–09 season.\n\nHarford led Luton Town to victory in the Football League Trophy final in a fiercely contested match against Scunthorpe United on 5 April 2009. The tie ended 3–2 after extra time and saw a crowd of 40,000 Luton fans make the short trip down the M1 to Wembley Stadium. However, one week later in the league, the 30-point deduction imposed on the club proved too large an obstacle to overcome, and Harford's Luton succumbed to relegation to the Football Conference. On 1 October 2009, after a disappointing start to life in the Conference, Harford parted company with Luton Town by mutual consent.\n\nIn December 2009, Harford became assistant manager of QPR for a second time. After the resignation of Paul Hart, Harford stepped up to take charge of first team affairs at QPR. He lasted until 1 March 2010 when he was replaced by Neil Warnock.\n\nOn 17 May 2012, Harford was appointed as assistant manager to Karl Robinson at Milton Keynes Dons. He left just over a year later to re-join Millwall as assistant manager. He later became Millwall's Head of Scouting before being replaced by Terry Bullivant in July 2015.\n\nIn January 2016, Harford made a return to Luton Town as chief recruitment officer with responsibility for scouting. Following Luton manager Nathan Jones' departure to Stoke City in January 2019, Harford was appointed as the club's caretaker manager. After five wins in his first six league games in charge, putting the club six points clear at the top of the League One table, Harford's appointment was extended until the end of the 2018–19 season.\n\nFollowing Graeme Jones's departure from the club by mutual consent in April 2020, Harford was once again appointed as interim boss at Luton Town.\n\nLeague appearances only.\n\nLuton Town\n\nLuton Town\n"}

In his own words, it is the kind of novel that he personally would like to read. \"Third Wish\" was first published in Czech by the Prague publisher (ARGO), and was released in November 2004, as supported by a personal appearance by Fulghum. Each individual copy was packaged in a box of cedar wood. A sequel was planned for 2006, and a third novel, called Third Wish: Granted, has now been written and published as well. \n\n\"Third Wish\" was published in English as a 5-part, 2-volume set in February, 2009.\n\nThe publisher book description summarizes the story as follows: \"In fairy tales, the third wish is the last one left when the first wish was foolish, and the second wish was used to undo the first wish. Now the remaining wish must be used wisely and well--with the help of co-conspirators. The main thread of the story--like Ariadne’s string guiding Theseus into the labyrinth with the Minotaur--begins at a table on a terrace on the Greek Island of Crete (one chapter is about Olive tree of Vouves), winds its way into the center and back out to the same table, passing through Greece, Japan, France, England, and Seattle. Its main characters are Alice, Max-Pol, Aleko, Wonko, Zenkichi, Polydora, Alice-Alice, and Dog. Woven into the fabric of the novel are cultural history, art, philosophy, archeology, poetry, theater and music. The mode of the novel is contained in the words Slowly, Surprise, and Witness. More than anything else, \"Third Wish\" is a long love story--not in the usual sense--but the story of people who love life and will go to great lengths to find a flourishing Way onward.\"\n\nAmericanDigest.org, .\n"}
{"id": "1810239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810239", "title": "Arnold Air Society", "text": "Arnold Air Society\n\nThe Arnold Air Society (AAS) is a professional, honorary, service organization advocating the support of aerospace power. AAS is open to officer candidates in Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) and at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA), and is formally affiliated with the Air Force Association (AFA). In addition to AFROTC or Academy commitments, AAS members must complete candidate training, attend meetings, and contribute to their respective Squadrons and ROTC detachments. Doing so enhances the officer candidate experience of cadets as well as builds stronger leadership, organizational, and professional skills.\n\nArnold Air Society was first proposed as an idea for an extracurricular organization by ROTC cadets at the University of Cincinnati in the summer of 1947. After having their idea approved by active members of the Air Force, the cadets wrote a constitution for their new, honorary society. They called it the “Arnold Society of Air Cadets” in honor of General Henry “Hap” Arnold, the only 5-Star General of the Air Force.\n\nSince its inception, Arnold Air Society grew quickly. It focused on high morals, physical fitness, and a positive attitude toward the Society and its goals. Since it is the mission of ROTC and the Air Force Academy to produce leaders, AAS enhances that mission by building these values into cadets early on, and ensuring that they maintain these standards.\n\nArnold Air Society was officially recognized by the Air Force in April 1948. It was then the goal of the Society to recruit and build more Squadrons to make the Society bigger. Within the next year, an additional twenty squadrons were formed across the country.\n\nAnother important concept of Arnold Air Society was the National Conclave. The National Conclave (NATCON) is held annually to review the policies and procedures of the Society. The first NATCON was held at the University of Cincinnati in 1950. At this time, all Squadrons from around the nation can gather to vote on new leadership for the upcoming year as well.\n\nThe first Honorary Sponsor of Arnold Air Society was Mrs. Eleanor Arnold. General James Doolittle was chosen to be the Honorary Commander following General Henry Arnold’s death in 1950. Following the first National Conclave, the Society’s official name became Arnold Air Society, a deviation from the original title. Following the second National Conclave, AAS became officially affiliated with the Air Force Association, and at the fourth and fifth NATCONs, it was proposed that the organizational structure of the Society be changed.\n\nAfter the first few years of existence, the Executive Board was formed, which would be responsible for national leadership and organization. The Executive Board consisted of the AAS National Commander and the several AAS Area Commanders and normally met twice a year, once at the AAS NATCON and once at the Air Force Association National Convention. The Executive Board makes decisions that are vital to the structure and success of Arnold Air Society as a whole. In its early stages, many of the primary awards and policies were founded which are still in practice today.\n\nEach prospective member for Arnold Air Society must be a member of a local AFROTC detachment and at least meet those academic and physical standards. If these criteria are met, then the individual can enter the Candidate Training Program.\n\nDuring the six to eleven-week training program (at individual squadrons' discretion), the candidate must attend at least 90% of all candidate activities. Also, the candidate class must complete at least one service project that benefits their detachment, university campus, or their community. In addition, candidates must gain the signatures of all of the active members of their squadron, unless otherwise stated by the squadron commander. The candidate class is highly encouraged to attend at least one of the squadron’s active members' meeting.\n\nIn addition to the physical and military standards that all candidates are expected to reach, there are also academic standards. The candidate must take a National Test at the conclusion of their candidate training program. The candidate must pass the test with a score of at least 80%.\n\n\nArnold Air Society has interrelated objectives which serve to enhance the AFROTC and USAFA commissioning programs and project the USAF image on campus and in the community:\nLikewise, AAS has three goals:\n\nThe nation has been broken into eleven numbered regions (I through XI), which in turn are composed of squadrons.\n\nNational Headquarters is chosen yearly by the National Conclave, and may not be hosted by the squadron for more than two consecutive years. National HQ is led by the AAS National Commander, an AAS C/Brig-Gen. The recommended national staff is as follows, with the Vice Commander holding the position of AAS C/Col and all other staff AAS C/Lt Col.\n\nThe region staff typically consists of the same positions as national staff. The commander is an AAS C/Col, vice commander an AAS C/Lt Col, and other staff members are AAS C/Maj's. Region HQ is chosen annually at the Region Conclave and changes at NATCON.\n\nSquadron positions are similar to their region counterparts and are elected by squadron members IAW squadron by-laws. The commander is an AAS C/Maj, Deputy Commander an AAS C/Capt, and other staff members AAS C/1st Lt's.\n\nNote: Individual squadrons have different combinations of CTOs and DTs for their training program.\nNote: A squadron should also have a CSCOP - Chapter/Squadron Chief of Protocol that monitors and enforces the rules and regulations within Arnold Air Society and Silver Wings. The CSCOP is a Joint Position and may be held by either an AAS Member or an SW Member. This position is outside of the normal Squadron Chain of Command. According to Joint Protocol Manual 1 (JPM-1)-2009 the Chapter Squadron Chief of Protocol, if in AAS, holds the rank of AAS C/Capt.\n\n\n"}
