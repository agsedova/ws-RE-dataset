In some of these reports, it is claimed that Ayyavazhi is an anti-Christian religious phenomenon. The rapid growth of the London Missionary Society is heavily challenged by Ayyavazhi in Thiruvithancore, which is the most succeeded venue of LMS in India and revealed in certain reports.\n\nThis report says about the fast spread of Ayyavazhi then throughout the regions of Southern Kerala (then Travancore) and South Tamil Nadu (the then 'Tinnevely') as, \"multitudes of people flocked from all parts of the provinces of Travancore and Tinnevelly.\"\n\nOne part of the report states that Ayya Vaikundar's devotees believe they were \"cured by him of different diseases.\" On the Ayyavazhi religion, the report says that \"multitudes of people flocked to him from all parts of Travancore and Tinnevelly.\" \"(p. 71)\"\n\nOn the Thuvayal Thavasu, the report goes on to say: \"About seventy families of this sect, having subsequently established a community of goods, removed under the guidance of a man of some influence to a part of the sea-shore in Tinnevelly, where they erected huts, performed frequent ablutions, and often assembled to hear the dreams and vision of their leader and to witness the miracles he was said to perform.\" \"(p. 71)\"\n\nApart from this, it mentions the practice of vegetarianism in Ayyavazhi, saying that \"[they] abstained from all kinds of animal food, and observed the most simple and abstentious habits\".\"(p. 71)\"\n\nThis report is also a witness from any external source to show the interference of Travancore King into Ayyavazhi. This report says that, \"The Government, however, interfered, and the excitement quickly died away.\" \"(p. 71)\"\n\nThe same report Call Vaikundar as a person of \"deranged mind\". \"(p. 71)\"\n\nThis report also calls Ayyavazhi as a \"new and singular sect\". \"(p. 71)\"\n\nIn one part of these report, the missionaries view \"Ayyavazhi\" as an anti-Christian religious\nphenomenon, using such phrases as an \"agent of Satan\" \"(pp. 78–79)\" when referring to \"Ayya Vaikundar\", and further reported that large \"numbers of the low classes have joined him (Vaikundar).\"\n\nThe same report notes the \"rapid and extraordinary career\" of Vaikundacami (Vaikundar) \"(p. 75)\", mentioning that his religious phenomenon had \"spread to an astonishing degree, showing by its progress.\" \"(p. 75)\"\n\nThe report also says that, \"he is enabled to perform the cure of all diseases, and to confer innumerable blessings on his followers.\" (p. 75)\n\nIt also says that such a fast spread of Ayyavazhi created an excitement in the country as \"so much excitement\" and also that the majority was from low class of the society as, \"numbers of the low\nclasses have joined him\". \"(p. 75)\"\n\nIn another part of the report, it mentions that Vaikundacami \"asserts that one of the principle Hindu deities has taken up his abode within him,\" and that because of this, \"he is enabled to perform the cure of all diseases, and to confer innumerable blessings on his followers.\" \"(p. 75)\"\n\nThe same report call the activities of Vaikundar as \"amid these indications of advancement and the triumph (of LMS mission), it is painful to find that the agents of the prince of this world have been busily engaged in their malignant attempts to frustrate, if possible, the work of God. A negative religious imposter, named Moottecoothee, having gathered numerous disciples around him from among the heathen, has also succeeded in gaining over to his impious cause, several who had a profession of Christianity and stood in visible connection with the followers of the redeemer\" \"(p. 78-79)\"\n\nThis report provides information that around 10,000 people had joined the practice of Christianity, principally of the \"Shanar tribe,\" an area near Patnam (Thengapattanam), and that, \"an equal, if not greater, number had taken to Ayyavazhi.\" (p. 88-89)\n\nAnother report speaks of Vaikundar, treating diseases with only earth and water, stating: \"They take no medicine; but rub ashes on the forehead and drink cold water (patham) as the cure for all diseases.\" \"(p. 88-89)\"\n\nIt also says that the followers of Ayyavazhi \"have instituted a new mode of worship\" in the place of the \"pagan rites.\"\n\nThis report also says that, \"they have instituted a new mode of worship, in which no images are introduced... They ... inveigh zealously against idols and demons, and profess only to worship an\nincarnation of Veeshnoo.\" (P. 88-89) This report also form one among the external evidences to the fact that Vaikundar is believed as an incarnation of God even as early in the time of Vaikundar.\n\nAgain, as in the 1838 report, this report mentions the practice of vegetarianism in a disciple of Vaikundacami who, \"abstained from flesh and ate only vegetables.\" And it refers to an active female follower of Ayyavazhi who \"abstained from fish on Tuesdays and Fridays.\"\n\nIn this report, Vaikundar had been viewed as a \"False Prophet\".\n\nThis report also call Swamithope as, \"head-quarters of Mutthukuttiism.\" (P. 107)\n\nIn this report, reference is made to those engaged in the practice of Thuvayal Thavasu. Specifically, a comparison appears to be made in the report that the devotees of Ayya Vaikundar, especially the\nThuvayal Thavasu participants, keep their bodies and their houses cleaner than the other people of\nchanar tribe.\n\nThis report speaks of it as \"a modern sect, greatly on the increase\", says that, \"day after day, numbers flocked to him (Vaikundar)\" \"(Patrick p. 4, quoting Frederick Wilkinson, ARTDC 1864)\".\n\nIn this report a missionary Frederick Wilkinson opinioned negatively about Vaikundar as, \"While young Muthukutti was a cowherd and afterwards became a palmyra-climber from the circumstance of his having a long and entangled plait of hair on his head he imagined he was specially favoured by the deity and got many to believe that he was the incarnation of Vishnu. Day after day numbers flocked to him.\" (P. 4)\n\nThis report says the special worship on Ayyavazhi centers as, \"He ordered his followers to worship him especially on Sundays.\" (P. 4)\n\nThis report also says about the then construction of Swamithope Pathi as, \"after his death they erected a tomb over his grave and a substantial building on the site in which they worship him.\" (P. 4)\n\nThe same report says that, \"they (followers of Ayyavazhi) say that Muthukutti will come again, raise his followers from the dead.\" (P. 4)\n\nThis is also a part which tells about the spread of Ayyavazhi. It says that \"he (Vaikundar) drew after him a great many people\" \"(Patrick p. 15, quoting Goodeve Mabbs from ARTDC 1866)\".\n\nThis report witness the monthly and yearly festivals in Swamithope Pathi as, \"... built him a tomb, and hold monthly and yearly festivals in his honour.\" (P. 15)\n\nThis report also says that, \"Many of the heathen now worship a new deity of the name Muttukutti.\"(P. 15).\n\nThis report reads as, \"It was in the village comprising this (Thamaraikulam) section that the gospel gained its earliest conquests in South Taravancore. Progress was rapid. Congregation were formed and adherents come over in great numbers. In 1821 there were upwards of 1200 converts in these place. It seemed as if the whole population would soon be brought under the influence of the cross. But a terrible check was given to our operations by the rise of Muthukuttyism. ... shrines rose, rites and ceremonies are initiated, temples were dedicated and lastly a car festival was instituted at Kottayady to which thousands are annually drawn from the towns and villages far and near. This cunning contrivance of Satan has much impeded our progress in these parts and s still a great power of darkness against which we have to wage unceasing war. Our weapon are mighty through God, to the pulling down of strongholds. We have truth on our side against which neither Muthukuttyism nor any other gate to hell shall prevail. All we need is more life in these churches...\"\n\nThis report records the anguish of Mr Nathaneil, an evangelist of Jamestown, who 'deplored' the\nincrease of the followers of Ayyavazhi in \"several places around him.\" \"(Patrick p. 7, quoting S. Jones, ARTDC 1871).\"\n\nThis report also views Ayyavazhi as an anti-Christian religion, speaking about a female shaman of Ayyavazhi, \"a widow living at this place who was a follower of Muthukutti. She was also a fortune-teller and pretended to cure diseases by incantations. She allowed her hair to grow matted like that of Pantaram, abstained from fish on Tuesdays and Fridays, performed her ablutions in the sea, sang for four or five hours together in honour of her swami and was occasionally under the influence of the devil.\" \"(Patrick p. 4-5, quoting Ebenezer Lewis, ARTDC 1858).\"\n\nIn this same report Ebenezer Lewis (a missionary) says about the way of worship if people in Ayyavazhi centers as, \"they sing and dance in honour of their Swami.\"\n\nIn this report Ebenezer Lewis (a missionary), calls Vaikundar as an \"imposter\". (P. 15)\n\nThis report presents the reply of an Ayyavazhi follower to a Christian Mossionary as, \"We worship the true God, what business have you here? We need not your instructions, begone... Narayanan (Vaikuntacami) is the true God; it is he who created us... All who deny the divinity of Narayanana are fools and mad men, for no man of sense will do it.\" It also says that, \"thousands continue to worship him still, believing that before long he will rise from the dead.\" (P. 15-16)\n\nThis report says a public proclamation of a mendicant devotee of Ayyavazhi as, \"at this time he was telling the people that the Swami Vaigundar is expected soon, that he has sent messages to his devotees upon the people and render the country prosperous.\" (P. 5)\n\nIt says that, \"Some years ago a Palmara clmber named Muthukutty claimed to be the incarnation of Vishnu and deceived many people. His followers had erected pagodas in many places. As they regard Muthukutty as incarnation of Vishnu, they affirm that the worship of Muthukutty is really a worship of the supreme being ... This imposter is one of the chief obstacles to the spread of the gospel in these parts.\" (Page. 6-7)\n\nThis report (says about the way of worship as, \"the followers meet together in a building something smaller than... village Chapels\" and \"dancing and plenty of noise make up the greater part of the worship.\" (P. 4)\n\nThis report says that, the people seem to have considered 'Vaikuntacami' (Vaikundar) as, \"the last avatar of Vishnu.\" (P. 8)\n\n\n"}

Wu Ma made his screen debut in 1963, and with over 240 appearances to his name (plus 49 directorial credits within a fifty-year period), he was one of the most familiar faces in the history of Hong Kong Cinema and best known as the Taoist ghosthunter in \"A Chinese Ghost Story\".\n\nBorn Feng Hongyuan in Tianjin, Republic of China. At 16 he moved to Guangzhou and became a machinist before migrating to Hong Kong in 1960. In 1962, Feng enrolled in the Shaw Brothers acting course. Graduating a year later, he became a contract player for the studio and made his first appearance in \"Lady General Hua Mu-lan\". He then appeared in such films as \"Temple of the Red Lotus\" (1965), \"The Knight of Knights\" (1966) and \"Trail of the Broken Blade\" (1967). He took on the stage name 'Wu Ma' as it reflected the animal in the year of his birth (the horse), and believed it was short enough for audiences to remember. \n\nDuring an interview, Wu explained that he had stumbled upon directing when he was offered an unexpected trip to Japan for a movie. The film's original assistant director was unable to clear his visa in time, and Wu was called upon to take his place. After the experience, Wu decided to become a director.\n\nIn 1970, Wu became a director in his own right. His directorial debut, \"Wrath of the Sword\", was released the same year. In 1971, Wu released one of his seminal works, \"The Deaf And Mute Heroine\". He concentrated on directing in the 1970s, directing several movies – such as \"Young Tiger\" (1973) and \"Wits To Wits\" (1974). \"Wits To Wits\" has been noted as one of the precursors of the knockabout comedy kung fu genre that was later made famous by Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan. Another movie Wu directed, \"Manchu Boxer\" (1974), featured Sammo Hung, then a young choreographer and later one of the trend-setters of Hong Kong cinema. This marked the beginning of a strong working relationship between the two, which would become prominent towards the 1980s. He co-directed with his former mentor Chang in several movies – \"The Water Margin\" (1972), \"The Pirate\" (1973), \"All Men Are Brothers\" (1975) and \"The Naval Commandos\" (1976).\n\nWhile most of his output during this period was as a director, Wu continued to appear as an actor and appeared both in his own movies and in several others, although his roles were generally limited to small appearances. During the mid-1970s, Wu joined a small exodus who were leaving Shaw Brothers due to corruption within the studio and became an independent director. Despite becoming an independent director, Wu was still able to work closely with some Shaw Brothers stars such as Ti Lung (\"The Massive\" (1978)). \n\nAs the 1970s and the era of the martial arts film mania slowed down albeit very slightly, Wu Ma's output as a director also slowed. His acting output, however, increased as he became increasingly well known as a popular character actor. Wu had made appearances in Sammo Hung's 1970s movies (such as \"Iron Fisted Monk\"), his association with Hung began in earnest in the early 1980s. Wu appeared in \"Encounters of the Spooky Kind\" (1980). Throughout the 1980s, Wu and Hung had a close working relationship, often with Wu as the director and Hung as the producer (such as \"My Cousin The Ghost\" (1986)). Wu worked in Hung's production company Bo Ho as the production manager, and made appearances in Hung-directed films during the 1980s, including \"Millionaire's Express\" (1986) and \"Wheels on Meals\" (1984).\n\nTowards the mid-1980s, Wu became one of the most prolific character actors in Hong Kong, his now-rubbery face able to shift effortlessly across a spectrum of emotions. During the 1980s, he received three Hong Kong Film Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor – for \"Righting Wrongs\" (1986), where he played a policeman having to deal with his son's death; the classic \"A Chinese Ghost Story\" (1987) as Yin Chek-Ha, which is considered as one of the greatest films ever made; and in \"The Last Eunuch in China\" (1988), as Lord Ting. He began a working relationship with Tsui Hark, and appeared in several of Hark's movies. Aside from \"A Chinese Ghost Story\", Wu also appeared in the earlier classic \"Peking Opera Blues\" (1986). \n\nAfter \"A Chinese Ghost Story\", said by Wu to be among his most favorite movies, Wu began to focus on the supernatural genre. Much of his directorial efforts after 1987 were within that genre, such as \"Portrait of a Nymph\" (1988), \"Burning Sensation\" (1989) and \"Fox Legend\" (1991).\n\nWu continued his working relationship with Hark, and appeared in \"Once Upon A Time in China\" (1991) and \"The Swordsman\" (1991). The early 1990s were an especially prolific period in Wu's career – with Wu appearing in over 14 movies during one year. As the Hong Kong film industry began to slump, Wu's career also slowed considerably. After appearing in \"High Risk\" (1995), many of his appearances were either in low-budget movies or in television series. \n\nWu Ma had a relationship with actress Agassi Wang (王玉環) from the mid-1980s to early 1990s.\n\nIn 1995, Wu went to Shenzhen to film and met a real estate agent Ma Yan (馬艷), who was 23 years younger than him. After their marriage, she became his agent. They have one daughter.\n\nWu was diagnosed with lung cancer and it was announced that the disease started to spread ten months ago. His wife stated that \"He had enjoyed every precious minute with his family, which explained that he had casually walked his path with pride and dignity.\" He died peacefully at his home in Hong Kong on 4 February 2014 at the age of 71.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2200135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200135", "title": "Antoine Joseph Santerre", "text": "Antoine Joseph Santerre\n\nAntoine Joseph Santerre (16 March 1752 in Paris6 February 1809) was a businessman and general during the French Revolution.\n\nThe Santerre family moved from Saint-Michel-en-Thiérache to Paris in 1747 where they purchased a brewery known as the \"Brasserie de la Magdeleine\". Antoine Santerre married his third cousin Marie Claire Santerre, daughter of a wealthy bourgeois brewer, Jean François Santerre, from the Cambrai in March 1748. The couple had six children, Antoine Joseph being the 3rd. The others were Marguerite, born in 1750; Jean Baptiste, born in 1751; Armand Théodore, born in 1753; followed by François and Claire. The future general's father died in 1770, his mother just months later. His elder brother and sister, Marguerite and Jean Baptiste took charge of the household and family business, helping their mother raise the younger children, they never married. Armand Théodore went into the sugar business, and owned a factory in Essonnes, the other members of the family remained in the brewery business. François, known as François Santerre de la Fontinelle, had breweries in Sèvres, Chaville and Paris and Claire, the youngest, married a lawyer. Antoine Joseph was sent to school at the collèges des Grassins, followed by history and physics under M.M. Brisson and the abbot Nollet. His interest in physics led advances in beer production that pushed breweries out of their infancy.\nIn 1770 Antoine Joseph was emancipated, and 2 years later, with his inheritance he purchased with his brother François Mr. Acloque's brewery at 232 Faubourg St. Antoine for 65,000 French Francs. In that same year he married his childhood sweetheart, the daughter of his neighbour, Monsieur Francois, another wealthy brewer. Antoine Joseph was 20 years old and Marie François was sixteen. Marie died the following year from an infection derived from a fall during her 7th month of pregnancy.\nYears later Antoine Joseph married Marie Adèlaïde Deleinte with whom he had three children, Augustin, Alexandre and Theodore.\n\nHis generosity won great popularity in the Faubourg St. Antoine. When the French Revolution erupted in 1789, he participated in the storming of the Bastille and was given command of a battalion of the Parisian National Guard. After the Champ de Mars Massacre on 17 July 1791, a warrant was issued for his arrest and Santerre went into hiding. He emerged again the following year to lead the people of the Faubourg St. Antoine, the eastern units, in the assault on the Tuileries Palace by the Paris mob, which overwhelmed and massacred the Swiss Guard as the royal family fled through the gardens and took refuge with the Legislative Assembly. Louis XVI was officially removed as king soon after.\n\nSanterre was appointed by the National Convention to serve as the jailer of the former king. He notified Louis that the motion had passed for his execution, and the next day, at eight o'clock on a 21 January morning, Santerre arrived at the convicted man's room and said, \"Monsieur, it's time to go\". He escorted Louis XVI through the some eighty thousand armed men and countless citizens down the streets of Paris to the guillotine. There are differing accounts of his conduct at the execution itself. According to some, he ordered a drum roll halfway through the king's speech in order to drown out his voice. Others say that it was actually General J.F. Berruyer – the man in command of the execution – who ordered the drum roll, and that Santerre only relayed the order. Santerre's family maintained, however, that he actually silenced the drums so that Louis could speak to the people.\n\nSanterre was promoted to General of a division of the Parisian National Guard in July 1793. When the revolts broke out in the Vendée, Santerre took command of a force sent in to put a stop to the rebellions. He was not as successful as a military commander in the field; his first military operation saw the defeat of the Republican forces at Saumur. After the battle, reports circulated that Santerre himself had been killed; the Royalists even composed a humorous epitaph about his death. Nor was Santerre popular among the \"sans-culottes\" he commanded. Wounded soldiers returning to Paris reported that he was living in Oriental luxury and complained that their defeat was due either to his treason or his incompetence. Some demanded that he be relieved of his command or even sent to the guillotine. On the other hand, Santerre was not in supreme command, and not considered responsible for the outcome of the war.\n\nIn October, Santerre returned to Paris, where his popularity in the Faubourg St. Antoine was undiminished. Nevertheless, his report on this expedition, in which he drew attention to the plight of the Republican army in the Vendée, aroused suspicion. Accused of being a Royalist due to his lack of glory during the battles in the Vendée, he was arrested in April 1794 and was imprisoned until the fall of Robespierre. Upon his release, he resigned his command and attempted to return to business, but his brewery was ruined. He died in poverty in Paris on 6 February 1809.\n\n"}

{"id": "2200140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200140", "title": "Tommaso Tittoni", "text": "Tommaso Tittoni\n\nTommaso Tittoni (16 November 1855 – 7 February 1931) was an Italian diplomat, politician and Knight of the Annunziata. He was Italy's foreign minister from 1903 until 1909, except for a five-month period. He also was interim prime minister for about two weeks in March 1905.\n\nTommaso Tittoni was born in Rome. His father, Vincenzo, a tenant farmer on a large scale at La Manziana, had taken part in the defence of the Roman Republic under Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1849, was exiled by Pius IX, and re-entered Rome in 1870 through the breach of Porta Pia. Tittoni was educated first at Naples, and subsequently at Oxford and Liège.\n\nTittoni became an alderman of Rome, before becoming a deputy in the Chamber of Deputies for Civitavecchia in 1886, aligning himself with the right wing. He resigned his seat in 1897, having been appointed prefect of Perugia. Three years later he went to Naples in a similar capacity, and in 1902 he entered the Senate.\n\nWhen Giovanni Giolitti became premier for the second time in 1903, Tittoni became his foreign minister. He aimed at improving relations with Austria, and also tried to bring about a reconciliation with France. It was under his auspices that French President Émile Loubet visited Rome.\n\nOn the resignation of Giolitti in March 1905, Tittoni became interim premier for a few days and remained in Alessandro Fortis's cabinet as foreign minister. His proposal to reduce the duty on Spanish wines in connection with an Italo-Spanish commercial treaty aroused a storm of indignation among the agricultural classes and caused the fall of the cabinet on 24 December 1905, and although Fortis composed a new administration, Tittoni did not enter it.\n\nA few months later he was appointed ambassador in London (March 1906), but in May, on the fall of Sidney Sonnino's ministry and the return of Giolitti to power, he was again summoned to the Consulta (the Foreign Ministry). He continued the policy of improving relations with Austria-Hungary, which did not contribute to his popularity. After the Bosnian crisis and the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, his imprudently worded speech at Carate created the illusion that Italy was to be compensated, perhaps by the cession of the Trentino, and the disappointment when nothing of the kind materialized greatly weakened his prestige. He remained in office until the fall of Giolitti in December 1909.\n\nAs foreign minister, Tittoni prudently advanced Italian claims on Tripolitania, at the time part of the Ottoman Empire, without resorting to outright threats of annexation. The Tittoni family had interests in the area. In 1907, the Banco di Roma founded a branch in Tripoli and built significant interests in banking, shipping and agriculture. The bank's vice-president was Romolo Tittoni, the brother of Tommaso Tittoni. The bank also financed the important newspaper \"Corriere d'Italia\", which campaigned for the Italo-Turkish War in 1911.\n\nOn 24 October 1909, Tittoni and the Russian diplomat Aleksandr Izvolsky exchanged diplomatic notes on an informal agreement, known as the Racconigi Bargain, for Russia and Italy to support each other's interests in the Balkans and in the Ottoman Empire, at the Italian city of Racconigi, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia was hosted by King Victor Emmanuel III. Italy and the Russian Empire concluded another agreement with Austro-Hungarian Empire a few days later disregarding this agreement. In April 1910, he was appointed ambassador in Paris.\n\nWhen World War I broke out, in spite of his Triplicist policy (supporting the Triple Alliance, the \"Triplice\", of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy) he openly expressed himself in favour of Italian neutrality, and on Italy's entry into the war he was careful not to compromise himself with Giolitti's attitude. But he was not at his ease in the French capital, and in November 1916 he resigned from the Paris embassy. On the fall of the Orlando Cabinet in June 1919, the new Premier, Francesco Saverio Nitti, chose Tittoni as foreign minister and first delegate at the Paris Peace Conference. Nitti and Tittoni played down Italy's territorial claims, which disappointed \"interventionist\" like Gabriele D'Annunzio.\n\nIn July 1919, Tittoni and the Prime Minister of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos, agreed on a secret non-binding agreement, known as the Venizelos–Tittoni agreement about the conflicting territorial claims of the two countries. Greece pledged to support the Italian claims over Vlorë and the establishment of an Italian protectorate over Albania. Greece would also secure for Italy a free zone at the port of Smyrna (under Greek administration from May 1919), while Italy pledged to support the Greek territorial claims over Northern Epirus and transfer the Dodecanese to Greece, except for the island of Rhodes, which would remain under Italian rule until such time as Cyprus would be ceded to Greece by Britain.\n\nThe severe strain of the work told on his health forced Tittoni to resign in November 1919. He was chosen president of the Italian Senate in December 1919, and soon after was appointed Italian delegate on the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations, but ill-health again forced him to relinquish the latter two appointments. He remained president of the Senate until January 1929.\n\nAfter the March on Rome, Tittoni supported Mussolini's government and later became the first president of Royal Academy of Italy (28 October 1929 – 16 September 1930), the most important cultural institution of the fascist dictatorship. On 8 April 1923, he had received the supreme honour of the knighthood of the Annunziata by King Victor Emmanuel.\n\nHe died from a heart attack in Rome on 7 February 1931.\n\n"}
{"id": "2200143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200143", "title": "Landed gentry in China", "text": "Landed gentry in China\n\nThe term \"landed gentry\", or \"gentry\", originally used for Britain, does not correspond to any single term in Chinese. One standard work remarks that under the Ming dynasty, the elite who held privileged status through passing the Imperial exams were called \"shenshi\" 紳士 or \"jinshen\" 縉紳. These literati, or scholar-officials, are \"loosely known in English as the Chinese gentry\". Through education this elite held a virtual monopoly on office holding, and overlapped with an unofficial elite of the wealthy. After the Tang dynasty, the Song Dynasty developed the civil service exam to replace the nine-rank system which favored nobles. Under the Song dynasty, their power and influence eclipsed that of the hereditary and largely military aristocrats. They are also called 士紳 \"shishen\" \"scholar gentry\" or 鄉紳 \"xiangshen\" \"local gentry\". Attempts have been made to define them as a social class who had passed the examinations and so were eligible to hold office, as well as retired mandarins or their families and descendants. Owning land was often their way of preserving wealth.\n\nUnder the Confucian class system (the four occupations) the scholar-official was at the top with farmers, artisans, and merchants below them in descending order. Since the next highest class was agricultural, scholar-officials retired to landed estates. They did not work the land themselves but hired peasants as tenant farmers. In this period of Chinese history, peasants were actually of a higher class than the merchants. The sons of these mandarins aspired to pass the imperial exams and continue the family legacy. Members of the gentry were expected to be an example to their community as Confucian gentlemen.\nBy late imperial China, sons of merchants used their money to buy an education and enter the civil service. Also, financially desperate gentry married into merchant families which led to a breakdown of the old class structure. With the abolition of the exam system and the overthrow of the Qing dynasty came the end of the scholar-official as a legal group.\n\nAfter the New Culture Movement, radicals used the term to criticize land owners as \"feudal\". Mao Zedong led the way in attacking \"bad gentry and local bullies\" for demanding and collecting high rent from their tenants during the republican period, and indeed many local landlords organized violent gangs to enforce their rule. The communists were able to rally much of the village population through their promises of agrarian reform and land redistribution. After the People's Republic of China was established, many landlords were executed by class struggle trials and the class as a whole was abolished. Former members were stigmatized and faced persecution which reached its heights during the Cultural Revolution. This persecution ended with the advent of Chinese economic reform under Deng Xiaoping.\n\n"}

The AGSV provides interschool sporting competitions between the nine member schools in a range of sports across Summer and Winter seasons, as well as additional premiership sports. Following the end of each season, the AGSV selects top-performing students from any of the schools to compete in a representative competition against the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS). \n\nDuring the Summer season (October to March), the AGSV coordinates competitions between the member schools in Summer sports such as Basketball, Cricket, Summer Hockey and Tennis amongst others. During the Winter season (April to August), sports played include Football, Soccer, Winter Hockey and Cross Country amongst others. In addition to the two main seasons, other premiership sports played include Swimming (February to March), Athletics (July to September) and Water Polo (July to September).\n\nThe AGSV was founded in 1920 to provide an alternative to the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS). There were nine founding member schools: All Saints Grammar School, Brighton Grammar School, Camberwell Grammar School, Caulfield Grammar School, Haileybury College, Ivanhoe Grammar School, Malvern Grammar School, St Thomas College and Trinity Grammar School. In 1928, Carey Baptist Grammar School also joined the AGSV. Of these ten original schools, three (Camberwell, Ivanhoe and Trinity) are still AGSV members, four (Brighton, Carey, Caulfield and Haileybury) opted to join the APS instead in 1957, two (St Thomas with Essendon Grammar School and Malvern with Caulfield) amalgamated with other schools and one (All Saints) ceased to exist in 1925. \n\nIn 1958, Assumption College, Essendon Grammar School and Mentone Grammar School joined the AGSV. In 1964, 1965 and 1971 respectively, Marcellin College, The Peninsula School and Yarra Valley Grammar School joined the AGSV. In 1977, Essendon Grammar School amalgamated with the Penleigh Presbyterian Ladies' College to form the current Penleigh and Essendon Grammar School. Following this, there have no changes to the membership of the AGSV (as of August 2017). \n\nThe AGSV has provided annual Summer and Winter sports since its formation in 1920, as well as annual competitions in Swimming and Athletics amongst other sports. \n\nIn 1968, the AGSV and the APS established an annual Tennis competition between the best Tennis players in both associations. In 2000, this was extended to all Summer and Winter sports, and has remained an annual tradition since. Following every Summer and Winter season, the top-performing students in both the AGSV and the APS compete against each other in the annual competition between the two associations. \n\nIn 2001, the AGSV and the APS coordinated to form a combined AGSV/APS girls' sport program. This was mainly done to provide opportunities for fair competition to female students of schools from both associations. Of the twenty AGSV/APS schools, twelve are co-educational, eight are boys-only and none are girls-only. As such, most of the sporting competitions are dominated by boys and the opportunities for girls' sport are relatively limited in both associations. The AGSV/APS girls competition runs for the Summer and Winter seasons (not applying to the Athletics, Swimming or other sport that is contested outside the main seasons) and is separate from the boys competition, which remains AGSV-only. \n\nIn 2009, Troy Rowe (a former employee of Ivanhoe Grammar School) was appointed as the Executive Officer of the AGSV, a role he has held since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2200173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200173", "title": "Stybarrow Dodd", "text": "Stybarrow Dodd\n\nStybarrow Dodd (\"the hill of the steep path\") is a mountain or fell in the English Lake District. It stands immediately north of Sticks Pass on the main ridge of the Helvellyn range in the Eastern Fells, which is situated between the lakes of Thirlmere and the Ullswater.\n\nThe summit of Stybarrow Dodd is a smooth, rounded, grassy dome, like those of its two northern neighbours, Watson’s Dodd and Great Dodd. Together, these three rather similar fells are sometimes called ‘The Three Dodds’. All three are covered by the same sheet of volcanic rock.\n\nThe summit of Stybarrow Dodd stands on the main ridge of the Helvellyn range, immediately north of Sticks Pass. This ridge runs north-south for about 11 km without dropping below 600 m. Stybarrow Dodd occupies just over 1 km of this length, from Sticks Pass to the col which connects it to Watson's Dodd and Great Dodd. At this point the ridge is the watershed between the Eden river system to the east and the Derwent river system to the west. The fell rises to 843 m, standing nearly 100 m above Sticks Pass and 68 m above the col to the north. From its smooth, rounded, grassy summit, four shoulders or ridges extend in different directions.\n\nTo the west a generally grassy shoulder runs for about 2 km down into the valley of the How Beck and to the A591 road. This shoulder is sharply defined by the valleys of Stanah Gill to its north and Sticks Gill (West) and Fisherplace Gill to its south. It slopes gently at first to around the 450 m contour and then more steeply into the valley over a number of rocky crags. The bridleway to Sticks Pass rises over this shoulder. This ridge is drained by two gills just mentioned, which are now captured by a water leat and diverted into Thirlmere Reservoir.\n\nThe eastern side of Stybarrow Dodd is more complex and sprawling. Its eastern ridge divides into three parts, with the result that the foot of the mountain stretches along Ullswater from Glenridding to Aira Beck, with two intervening valleys. This side is drained by Aira Beck in Deepdale on the north, by Sticks Gill (East) and Glenridding Beck on the south, and by Glencoyne Beck and Mossdale Beck in the two valleys between the ridges. All of these flow directly into Ullswater. There is more detail about each of these ridges and their subsidiary tops on the Hart Side and Sheffield Pike pages.\n\nThere are also two short spurs to the north of the main summit. To the north-west one spur leads down to the col which connects the fell to Watson's Dodd and Great Dodd. To the north-east a longer spur called Middle Tongue runs 1.5 km down into Deepdale, between Browndale Beck and Aira Beck.\n\nSticks Pass, to the south of Stybarrow Dodd, crosses the Helvellyn ridge at a height of about 745 m, the highest pass in the Lake District crossed by a bridleway. Now used only by fellwalkers, it once provided a regular connection between the communities on either side of the Helvellyn range. The becks flowing to either side of the pass are both named Sticks Gill on Ordnance Survey maps. Alfred Wainwright first added the terms East and West to distinguish them\n\nThe route to the pass starts from Stanah in the west and rises over the west ridge of Stybarrow Dodd. It remains to the north of both Sticks Gills, so that most of its length is carried by Stybarrow Dodd. In 1928 the route was still marked by a number of sticks, from which it was supposed that the pass had been named. By the 1950s these sticks had vanished.\n\nThere is a short grassy summit ridge with a separate top and a small cairn at each end. The path lead to the south-western top but the highest point is 300 m to the north-east, a quiet place, out of sight of the ridge path which passes it lower down. It is marked by a small cairn which incorporates an upright piece of slate. Further to the north-east are an occasional pool and the fallen remains of a wall\nWainwright saw a ‘very loose estate-boundary iron post’, which is no longer present. It may well have been another like the ones found on Sheffield Pike. The only exposed rock is Deepdale Crag, just east of the fallen wall, though this is ‘hardly more than a short stony slope’.\n\nThe south-western summit is only three metres lower, but lies on the ridge path, and is marked by a small cairn. In the 1950s it was this point that sported the upright piece of slate, and whose height was recorded on the Ordnance Survey map, as 2,756 feet (840 m). \n\nAlthough the north-east top gives an extensive all-round panorama of Lakeland fells, the gentle rounded top of the fell occupies all the foreground. The lower south-west top offers almost as wide a view but without the flat foreground.\n\nThe whole of the fell, above the walls (walls surrounding the land ‘taken in’ to agricultural enclosures) to both east and west, is Open Access land. Much of the eastern side is owned by the National Trust.\n\nFrom the west there is access to the fell from Stanah on the bridleway to Sticks Pass. From the east, ascents can be made from Glenridding, via Greenside Road and the Sticks Pass bridleway, or via the Sheffield Pike and Green Side ridge. From the north-east ascents can begin from Dockray or High Row, either along the Hart Side ridge or through the rather wet valley of Deepdale. \n\nThe summit of Stybarrow Dodd may also be reached from the path along the Helvellyn ridge. A popular walk known as ‘The Dodds’ combines the three summits of Stybarrow Dodd, Watson’s Dodd and Great Dodd, often involving a circuit of Deepdale from High Row or Dockray.\n\nThe rocks of Stybarrow Dodd are all part of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (BVG), formed on the margin of an ancient continent during a period of intense volcanic activity, roughly 450 million years ago in the Ordovician Period.\n\nWithin that group, the bulk of the rocks forming the fell and its ridges belong to the Birker Fell Andesite Formation. These rocks are among the earliest of the volcanic rocks of the BVG, and are part of a thick succession of andesite sheets which now outcrop in a wide band around the western and northern sides of the Lake District.\n\nThese sheets were formed by successive eruptions of mobile andesitic lava from shallow-sided volcanoes. The composition of the erupting magma varied from time to time, with basaltic andesite occurring in a number of places. Individual lava flows may be separated by beds of volcaniclastic sandstone, sedimentary deposits formed from the erosion of the volcanic rocks.\n\nThe geological map shows basaltic andesite near Fisher Place, low on the west ridge of Stybarrow Dodd, as well as small amounts of volcaniclastic deposits on the same ridge.\n\nAfter the eruptions of the Birker Fell Formation the composition of the erupting magma changed from andesitic to dacitic, and as a result the nature of the volcanism became more explosive. A large caldera volcano was built in the area where Scafell and the Langdale Pikes stand today. The caldera was at least 15 km across, and as the caldera collapsed, much more than 400 cubic kilometres of magma were erupted. At the close of this volcanic activity, the caldera was filled with sedimentary deposits, represented today by the Seathwaite Fell Sandstone Formation, a sequence of bedded volcaniclastic sandstone and siltstone strata. However, deposition was not confined to the old caldera, and to the east of Thirlmere this formation rests directly on the Birker Fell andesites.\n\nOn the west ridge of Stybarrow Dodd, the geological map shows a thin deposit of the Seathwaite Fell Sandstone around the 700 m contour.\n\nAnother caldera volcano then formed in a new area. In the area to the north of Sticks Pass, the Birker Fell andesites (and the small area of Seathwaite Fell Sandstone) are overlain by the Lincomb Tarns Tuff Formation. This formation is one of the most widespread of the volcanic rocks of the Lake District; it seems that the whole district was buried beneath at least 150 m of densely welded ignimbrite, a rock formed from a pyroclastic flow of very hot gas and rock. This formation must represent a series of eruptions of truly exceptional magnitude, accompanying the formation of a volcanic caldera, probably in the area around what is now Helvellyn. \n\nOn Stybarrow Dodd this formation is represented by rocks of the Thirlmere Tuff Member, which covers the top of the fell with a thick sheet of welded rhyo-dacitic lapilli-tuff in which the individual pieces of semi-molten lava were flattened under the weight of deposits above them. This rock weathers to a white or pink colour, but it is covered by the smooth grassy turf characteristic of Great Dodd, Watson’s Dodd and Stybarrow Dodd, all of which are covered by the same sheet.\n\nStybarrow Dodd. Dodd seems to have been a later addition to the fell's name, which was recorded as \"Stibarro\" (1589), \"Stybrow\" (1794) and \"Stybarrow\" (as late as 1800), although \"Stiveray Dod\" is also found from about 1692. Probably 'hill of the steep-path,’ named after the path over Sticks Pass on its flanks, from the dialect word \"sty(e)\" ‘a steep path’ and \"berg\" (which often becomes \"barrow\" in place-names) from either the Old English \"berg\", ‘a hill’ or Old Norse \"berg\" ‘a mountain.’\n\nDod or dodd is a dialect word of unknown origin, but common in hill names in the Lake District and the Scottish Borders for bare rounded summits, either free standing or subsidiary shoulders to higher neighbours. \n"}

The CMR was amalgamated into the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) on 15 August 1867. The station became Peel Causeway for Hale on 1 January 1899, and on 1 January 1902 it was renamed Hale. The station was served by passenger trains from Manchester Central to Northwich and Chester Northgate. The CLC remained an independent entity, as a joint London, Midland and Scottish Railway and London and North Eastern Railway operation after the Grouping of 1923, until the creation of British Railways (BR). The station then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation on 1 January 1948.

{"id": "2200184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200184", "title": "Roy Fedden", "text": "Roy Fedden\n\nSir Alfred Hubert Roy Fedden MBE, FRAeS (6 June 1885 – 21 November 1973) was an engineer who designed most of Bristol Engine Company's successful piston aircraft engine designs.\n\nFedden was born in the Bristol area to fairly wealthy and influential parents. His older brother was the artist Romilly Fedden. Fedden's family was the first in the area to own a car, an interesting parallel with fellow engine designer, Harry Ricardo. This early influence almost certainly led to his future career. Fedden attended Clifton College, but did not do well scholastically and was known primarily for sports. After leaving, he declined to enter the Army, and announced he would apprentice as an engineer.\n\nHis apprenticeship was completed in 1906, and he immediately designed a complete car. He managed to convince the local firm of Brazil Straker to hire him, and the design was produced as the successful Shamrock. He remained at Brazil Straker over the following years, and he was particularly influential in convincing company management to take on the repair of various aircraft engines when World War I started. The company's role soon expanded to producing Rolls-Royce Hawk and Falcon engines, as well as major parts of the famous Rolls-Royce Eagle. Henry Royce offered Fedden a senior position with his company, but Fedden declined.\n\nIn 1915, Fedden started the design of his own aero engine, along with his draughtsman Leonard Butler. The two were inseparable for the next twenty years, and the part number of most components of Fedden's engines were prefixed \"FB\" to indicate the shared credit. They designed two engines during World War I: the 14-cylinder radial Mercury, notable for the cylinders being arranged helically instead of in two rows, and the larger, more conventional single row nine-cylinder Jupiter design of about .\n\nDuring this period, the aviation portions of Brazil Straker were purchased by Cosmos Engineering, where work on the designs continued. Both were ready for testing in 1918, but there seemed to be little interest at first. In September, however, a Mercury was experimentally fitted to a Bristol Scout and it dramatically improved performance, easily beating the competing Sunbeam Arab. Bristol then decided to try the Jupiter in their new Badger design, finding that it, too, completely outperformed the competing ABC Dragonfly. Production of both designs for Bristol was to start immediately but the war ended only days later and the contract was cancelled.\n\nWith the ending of the war, Cosmos had no production designs and their repair work was quickly dwindling. The company was soon insolvent. Convinced of the quality of the Cosmos designs, the Air Ministry \"made it be known\" that they would be rather happy if the company were purchased by Bristol, which eventually took place in 1920. Sir George White later noted that they acquired the Mercury design and seven engines, all the assets of Cosmos, along with Fedden and his design team, for just £15,000. Even then most sources suggest they only did so after being persuaded to do so by the Air Ministry, which is perhaps not surprising given the fragile economy of the era.\n\nBristol soon found a role for the larger design, which entered production at Bristol's new engine plant in Filton as the Bristol Jupiter. The Jupiter became a commercial success and was widely used around the world, resulting in Fedden becoming one of the most highly paid engineers in Europe. After Jimmy Ellor's pioneering work at the RAE on turbosuperchargers, the Jupiter was experimentally adapted with a turbo to become the first \"Orion\" design, although this saw little use.\n\nBy the late 1920s, the Jupiter design was no longer competitive and Fedden and Butler started work on a pair of new designs. Both would use a supercharger, at that time a new-fangled idea, to provide boost even at ground level and thereby deliver similar power as the Jupiter's from a much smaller engine. Re-using their earlier name, this design emerged as the Bristol Mercury, while a more powerful design at the same size as the original Jupiter became the Bristol Pegasus.\n\nIn 1925 and 1926, Harry Ricardo wrote a series of seminal papers at the RAE claiming that the poppet valve system was already operating at its peak capability, and that any future engines would have to use sleeve valves instead. Fedden and Butler immediately turned to such a design, adapting the Mercury to become the Bristol Aquila, and the Pegasus as the Bristol Perseus. However, both of these engines quickly found themselves at the \"low end\" of the power spectrum as ever-larger aircraft designs demanded ever-larger engines to power them.\n\nTo solve this problem, the two designs were quickly adapted to two-row configurations, resulting in the Bristol Taurus and the superb Bristol Hercules. Not one to rest on his laurels, Fedden then started adapting the Hercules into a two-row 18-cylinder design as the Bristol Centaurus.\n\nThe Taurus was in service when World War II started in 1939, but the Hercules was still in testing. Work on the Centaurus was suspended while the final problems with Hercules production were worked out. The entire Bristol sleeve-valve range would see widespread service throughout the war on a wide variety of designs. They were so successful that the Air Ministry forced a reluctant Bristol to help with the high-power Napier Sabre project that had bogged down due to problems with their sleeves.\n\nWith Hercules production in full swing in 1941, Fedden returned to the Centaurus. Production was able to start in 1942, but at the time there were few aircraft that could be adapted to a 2,500 hp engine. Newer designs intended to mount engines of this size appeared near the end of the war, notably certain versions of the Hawker Tempest, taking over from the Sabre in that design.\n\nEven as the Centaurus was beginning to enter production, Fedden began considering the need for an even larger design. At the time he pitched this for very large, long-range bombers and patrol aircraft, but he stated throughout development from late 1941 that the ultimate goal was the transatlantic airline market. This led to the Orion concept, originally an enlarged Centaurus of about 4,000 hp. They also considered a four-row design with 28 cylinders, but little work on that model was carried out.\n\nFor his role in creating some of the most successful aircraft engines of the era, Fedden was knighted in 1942.\n\nThe stress of wartime production needs had taken its toll on Leonard Butler, who left the company to recuperate. Although Fedden had created a long line of hugely successful engines for Bristol, he had fought constantly with management over funding priorities. Without Butler's influence it seems Fedden \"had enough\", and shortly after being knighted, he left Bristol to take up a variety of positions within the Government. For much of the remainder of the war, he travelled in the United States with another Bristol employee, Ian Duncan, to study US production line techniques to improve their own.\n\nIn 1945 Fedden led a Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP) mission to examine German aeronautical expertise and research. In the course of this, known as the \"Fedden Mission\", he visited the V-2 production centre and labour camps at Nordhausen. He wrote several articles on German engine design and production concepts, and concluded generally that the German engines were lacking in supercharger design and power-per-volume compared to British types, although their fuel injection systems and single-lever controls were excellent.\n\nOn his return Fedden, together with Duncan, set up Roy Fedden Ltd. in 1945. The company was provided sixty Volkswagen Type 1s by Major Ivan Hirst but was unable to sell any in the anti-German postwar climate and difficult economic conditions. The company's first product, the Fedden O-325, was a small horizontally-opposed fuel injected six cylinder sleeve valve aeroengine intended for helicopters or for submerged wing installation in aircraft. It was technically superior to any flat-four or -six produced in the U.S. and was being considered for the American Ercoupe. The engine did not progress beyond development as \"Roy Fedden Limited\" went into liquidation in June 1947. Fedden then turned to a new turboprop design, the Cotswold, meant to be installed within the wings of aircraft in either tractor or pusher configuration, This source may be misleading as Gunston shows three different schemes, all tractor nacelle installations. The Cotswold engine did not progress beyond the design stage. Finally they decided to design their own car, powered by a three-cylinder air-cooled radial, but they found it had vibration and overheating problems and tended to skid badly when being cornered hard. Work started on a replacement chassis, but the rest of the company's engineers lost interest and left, and soon the company had to be dissolved.\n\nAfter this, Fedden worked for a time consulting with George Dowty, but soon retired and spent his time teaching at the College of Aeronautics at Cranfield University.\n\nFedden was childless. He has sometimes been mistakenly described as the father of a prominent British artist, Mary Fedden. He was her uncle.\n\n"}
{"id": "2200186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200186", "title": "Law of value", "text": "Law of value\n\nThe law of the value of commodities (German: \"Wertgesetz der Waren\"), known simply as the law of value, is a central concept in Karl Marx's critique of political economy first expounded in his polemic \"The Poverty of Philosophy\" (1847) against Pierre-Joseph Proudhon with reference to David Ricardo's economics. Most generally, it refers to a regulative principle of the economic exchange of the products of human work, namely that the relative exchange-values of those products in trade, usually expressed by money-prices, are proportional to the average amounts of human labor-time which are currently socially necessary to produce them.\n\nThus, the fluctuating exchange value of commodities (exchangeable products) is regulated by their value, where the magnitude of their value is determined by the average quantity of human labour which is currently socially necessary to produce them (see labor theory of value and value-form). In itself, this theorem is fairly simple to understand and intuitively it makes sense to many working people. However, theorizing its implications is a much more complex task as it kept Marx busy across more than two decades.\n\nWhen Marx talked about \"value relationships\" or \"value proportions\" (German: \"Wertverhältnisse\"), he did not mean \"the money\" or \"the price\". Instead, he meant the value proportions that exist between products of human labour. These relationships can be expressed by the relative replacement costs of products as labour hours worked. The more labour it costs to make a product, the more it is worth and inversely the less labour it costs to make a product, the less it is worth. Money-prices are at best only an expression or reflection of Marx's value relationships—accurately or very inaccurately. Products can be traded above or below their value in market trade and some prices have nothing to do with product-values at all (in Marx's sense) because they refer to tradeable objects which are not regularly produced and reproduced by human labour, or because they refer only to claims on financial assets.\n\nThe \"law of value\" is often equated with the \"labour theory of value\", but this is strictly speaking an error, for five reasons.\n\nNevertheless, in the Marxist tradition, Marx's theory of product-value is conventionally labeled \"the labour theory of value\"—while controversy persists about how much Marx's theory actually differs from that of the classical political economists.\n\nIn \"Das Kapital\" Marx normally thinks of the quantity of labour that determines product-value as the ratio between the average total amount of labour-time required to produce a reproducible good, and the corresponding average amount of labour required to produce a unit of gold (see also gold standard). Already in 1844, long before he wrote \"Das Kapital\", Marx was very aware of credit money. Whereas \"commodity money\" (coinage or bullion) played an important role in the earlier stages of capitalist development, the growth of integrated capital markets meant increased use of credit money. Marx felt that the initial assumption of gold-money as a standard of value was justified, in analysing the capitalist relations of production and distribution. Thus, as follows:\nX quantity of product = Y quantity of average labour hours = Z quantity of gold-money\n\nMarx's idea is effectively that the value of traded products is the \"objectified expression\" of the current social valuation of the human labour implicated in producing them. For Marx, labour itself has no value in bourgeois society, only a price. Only the \"results of human work\" have value; the labour has to materialize itself in some kind of object which has value, and can be owned for a price or a fee. The importance of labour is its ability to preserve capital value, increase already existing value, and create wholly new value. How any individual happens to regard a particular product normally cannot change that social valuation at all; it's simply a \"social fact\" in the same way as \"the state of the market\" is a social fact, even though particular products can at any time trade at prices above or below their socially established value.\n\nMarx realized very well, that the assumption of gold-money was a simplification—there might not be such a stable relationship between price-levels, average commodity values, and gold quantities — but he regarded the assumption as helpful, in explaining the basic laws of motion [\"Bewegungsgesetze\"] of the capitalist mode of production \"in its ideal average\".\n\nWhile Marx used the concept of the law of value in his works \"Grundrisse\", \"A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\", \"Theories of Surplus Value\" and \"Das Kapital\", he did not explicitly formalise its full meaning in a mathematical sense, and therefore how it should be exactly defined remains to some extent a controversial topic in Marxian economics. Different economists dispute how the proportionality between exchange-value and labour-time should be mathematically understood or modeled, and about the measures which are relevant.\n\nUnderlying this debate are difficult conceptual questions about how the causal relationships in the economy between price relativities and time worked should be understood. Marx's analysis of value was dialectical, in the sense that he thought value phenomena could only be understood dynamically, holistically and relationally, but he did not spell out all the conceptual, quantitative and logical implications of his position with great exactitude. The scholarly debate about those implications continues even today.\n\nExcess demand can raise the prices of products traded, and excess supply can lower them; but if supply and demand are relatively balanced, the question arises of what regulates the settled exchange-ratios (or average price-levels) of products traded in that case, and this is what the law of value is intended to explain. According to the law of value, the \"trading ratios\" of different types of products reflect a real \"cost structure of production\", and this cost structure ultimately reduces to the socially average amounts of human labor-time required to produce different goods and services.\n\nSimply put, if product A takes 100 hours of human work to produce in total, and product B takes 5 hours to produce, the normal trading-ratio of A and B will gravitate to a rate of around 1:20 (one of A is worth 20 of B), because A is worth much more than B. Moreover, if A and B are combined and used up to make product C in 40 hours, then product C is likely to be worth the equivalent of around 145 hours of human work in total, including the work of actually making product C. For that reason, most market trade in products is regular and largely predictable as far as price levels are concerned, rather than chaotic and arbitrary. According to Marx, price movements were not simply random, arbitrary or chaotic, but governed by causal laws that limited price variability.\n\nThe concept of a \"cost structure\" refers to the (direct and indirect) current labour inputs required to make a product, reflected in its price level. The concept of a \"price structure\" refers to the fact that prices rarely exist, or change, in isolation; instead, price-levels are interdependent on other price-levels, so that, if some prices would change, a lot of other prices would start to change as well—transmitting a change in valuation across the economy. A \"structure\" exists if there is a fairly stable relationship across time between price-levels which are interdependent. Marx argues that the cost structures and price structures for products are, in general, determined by the law of value.\n\nThe law of value originates in the \"terms of exchange\" established for different products. If a producer has to supply too much of his own product to get a different product, this has direct consequences for the additional time he has to work to sustain himself and the trading of his product. Over time, and with more market integration, relatively stable values for products are established in accordance with production norms which exist independently of the productivity of individual producers. In that situation, each producer has to adapt his own production to those socially accepted values, the average terms of trade for products vary only within fairly narrow margins, and thus producers' activities fall under the sway of the law of value, which links \"the economy of labour-time\" with \"the economy of trade\". Paradoxically, as Marx says, the more that the producers become dependent on exchange, the more exchange appears to become independent of them. Product-markets begin to operate according to their own laws, to which the producers can only adjust themselves. If some prices go up, many other prices will go up as well because people have to cover their increased costs. If some prices go down, many other prices will go down as well since products otherwise fail to sell when cheaper alternatives become available, but no individual is in control of these price fluctuations, or in control of how all the price changes will impact on each other. All they can really do to influence the market is to raise or lower their own prices, but even so they can do that only within certain limits. Ordinarily, people have to accept and work with many given cost-price levels and given sale-price levels which they cannot do anything about. If a product cannot be produced at a certain cost, or if it cannot be sold at a certain price-level, it is unlikely that it will be available much at all.\n\nIn this way, Marx argues, production activities actually become dominated by the values of the products being produced and exchanged (so-called \"market forces\"), often quite irrespective of what human needs might be, because these product-values will determine whether and how it is \"economic\" or \"uneconomic\" to produce and trade particular products.\n\nAccording to Marx, \"economic value\" is a purely social category. It is only and exclusively a characteristic of things which are really produced and reproduced by human labour. Thus, things have an \"economic value\" simply and only because it takes human labour-time to make them. This value exists and persists quite independently of fluctuating prices in markets. Although they are connected, the value relationships between labour-products and price relationships can vary independently of each other, within certain limits. A price can be attached to almost any object, but this does not automatically mean that the object also has a value in Marx's sense of being the product of labour.\n\nThe field of application of the law of value is limited to \"new output by producers of traded, reproducible labour-products\", although it might indirectly influence trade in other goods or assets (for example, the value of a second-hand good may be related to a newly produced good of the same type). Thus, the law does not apply to all goods, services or assets in an economy, and it does not rule the whole economy. In modern Marxism, the law of value is often equated with \"market economy\", but that was not Marx's own idea. Rather, it limits, regulates and constrains the trade in products. Simply put, the socially necessary labour requirements set limits for the movements of product prices. Primary products are a special case, which Marx discusses in his theory of differential and absolute ground rent. World market prices for primary products can at any time be strongly influenced by the yield of harvests and mines in different countries, regardless of labour effort. There are, besides, various kinds of products which, for one reason or another, are not subject to the law of value (see below).\n\nAccording to Marx, the knowledge that the law of value existed, expressed in one form or another, sometimes more clearly and sometimes less, was very ancient—it reached right back to the first nomadic traders in food, crafts, services and minerals. People knew very well that there was a definite relationship between time worked and the value of products traded; in itself that was not a very difficult insight to grasp. In fact, three hundred years before the Scottish and English political economists, Ibn Khaldun had already formally presented a fairly sophisticated understanding of the law of value. The economic effects of the availability or lack of labour—already reckoned with some precision in ancient Sumer more than four thousand years ago—were rather self-evident in practical life. Nevertheless, different thinkers in history failed to \"conceptualize\" the law of value with any adequacy.\n\nThe basic idea of the law of value was expressed by Adam Smith in \"The Wealth of Nations\". Neoclassical economist Paul A. Samuelson (1971) famously argued that \"the beaver-deer exchange ratio can range anywhere from 4/3 to 2/1 depending upon whether tastes are strong for deer or for beaver\" and, therefore, it seems that trading ratios are regulated only by the volume and intensity of consumer demand, as expressed by consumer preferences, rather than by labour-time. According to the classical economists, however, such shifts in trading ratios would quickly cause a switch from beaver-hunting to deer-hunting or vice versa; short-term fluctuations in demand could not usually change the labour-costs of hunting as such, except if new technologies suddenly made it possible to capture more game in less labour-time, or if the herds of animals had become seriously depleted.\n\nThe concept of the law of value was also stated by David Ricardo at the very beginning of his \"Principles of Political Economy and Taxation\", as follows:\n\nAt the most basic level, this Ricardian law of value specified \"labor-content\" as the substance and measure of economic value, and it suggests that trade will—other things being equal—evolve \"towards the exchange of equivalents\" (insofar as all trading partners try to \"get their money's worth\"). At the basis of the trading process is the economising of human time, and normal trading ratios become known to, or accepted, by economic actors. This leads naturally to the idea that the law of value will \"balance out\" the trading process. The corollary is that market trade is regarded as intrinsically \"self-regulating\" through the mutual adjustments of supply and demand: market trade spontaneously tends towards an equilibrium state.\n\nMarx's real concern was to understand and analyze how the law of value determines or regulates exchange, i.e. how the balancing of the production of outputs and the demand for them could be accomplished, in a society based on a universal market such as capitalism, and how this was regulated by labour-time. Marx's theory specifically aims to grasp capital \"in motion\", i.e. how, through the circulation and competitive dynamics of capital, changing expenditures of social labor are reconciled with (or fail to be reconciled with) changing social needs. In the third volume of \"Das Kapital\", he aims to show how the competition for profits from production is constrained by the law of value and how this shapes the developmental pattern of capitalist production. He concludes that the law of value cannot directly regulate commodity prices in capitalist production, but only indirectly (prices of production are constrained by comparative costs in labour time).\n\nMarx praised Adam Smith for already recognizing that in the transition \"from simple commodity exchange and its law of value to... exchange between capital and wage-labour... \"something new\" occurs, [so that] apparently (and actually, in the result) the law of value changes into its opposite.\" However, Marx noted both Adam Smith and David Ricardo were unable to explain consistently how product-values were regulated by labour-time within \"capitalist\" production. Both Smith and Ricardo deeply believed that price structures for products were determined by the law of value; but, Marx argued, neither of them could explain how that value-price relationship operated, without contradicting themselves. They could not theoretically reconcile the regulation of commodity trade by law of value, with profit-receipts \"in proportion to capital employed\" (rather than in proportion to labour-time worked). Smith and Ricardo mooted the concept of \"natural prices\" instead, to postulate a \"natural\" (intrinsic) self-balancing tendency of markets—at the point where demand and supply were balanced, the \"natural\" price (the \"true\" value) had been reached. The effect was that their \"labour theory of value\" was disconnected from their theory of capital distributions. In Marx's theory, a true supply/demand balance in the capitalist economy—which, if it existed at all, would occur only incidentally—would mean that goods sold at their normal production price, but this did not automatically or necessarily mean that they sold at their \"value\". The production prices could be persistently above or below product-values.\n\nEconomic value exists necessarily, according to Marx, because human beings as social beings and moral subjects must co-operatively produce and economize their means of life to survive. Humans have to value things, and each other, in order to survive. In so doing they are subject to relations of production. They know that their products have a socially accepted value, even if no trade occurs yet. Three main kinds of relationships are involved which are objectively and empirically verifiable, and often formalised in law:\n\nThe attribution of value to labor-products, and therefore the economising of their use, occurs within these three types of relationships interacting with each other. The value of one product then depends on the value of many other products, and, in a community of independent private producers, their economic relations are then necessarily expressed through the product-values of what they trade. This expression involves character masks. Over time, most products acquire a normal exchange-value, meaning that what a product costs relative to other products remains fairly stable. However, because these three types of relationships co-exist and interact objectively independent of individuals, it may appear that economic value is an intrinsic property of products, or alternately, that it is simply a characteristic that results from negotiations between market actors with different subjective preferences. Marx recognised that value has both objective and subjective aspects, but he was primarily concerned with the objectification of value through market trade, where objectified (reified) value relations rule human affairs (see value-form). Paradoxically, he argues, this phenomenon meant that human lives became \"ruled and dominated\" by the products which people themselves had produced, and more specifically by the trading values of those products.\n\nWhen more and more of human requirements are marketised, and a complex division of labor develops, the link between value and labor-time becomes obscured or opaque, and economic value seems to exist only as an impersonal \"market force\" (a given structure of priced costs and sale-values) to which all people must adjust their behaviour. Human labor becomes dominated by the economic exchange of the products of that labor, and labor itself becomes a tradeable abstract value (see Abstract labour and concrete labour).\n\nThe result of the difficulties in explaining economic value and its sources is that value becomes something of a mystery, and that \"how\" the attribution of value really occurs is no longer clear. The three relationships mentioned become mixed up, and are confused with each other, in commercial and economic discourse, and it appears that things and assets acquire an independent power to create value, even although value is a human attribution. Marx refers to this as commodity fetishism or thingification (\"Verdinglichung\" or reification) which culminates in what he calls fictitious capital. Value then seems to appear spontaneously out of trading activity. He regards this perception as an inevitable effect of commercial practice, since it involves the circumstance that objects acquire a value which exists independently of the valuer, a value \"set by the state of the market\" which individuals normally cannot change and must adjust to. The end result is that value theory is banished from economics as a useless metaphysics, surviving only in the form of assumptions made about price behaviour. Because money-prices offer convenient quantifiable and generally applicable units of economic value, no further inquiry into value is deemed necessary.\n\nTo solve the riddle of economic value, Marx argues, we must investigate the real historical origins of the conditions which give rise to the riddle in the first place, i.e. the real economic history of trade and the way that history has been reflected in human thought. Once we do this, value is no longer defined simply an attribute of products and assets, but as a relation between objects and subjects.\n\nThomas T. Sekine has interpreted Marx's law of value as a purely theoretical principle of market equilibrium which has no application to empirical reality. This raises the question of how we verify that it is a \"law\" at all. Paul Mattick argued that Marx offered no theory of market equilibrium, only a dynamic theory of enlarged economic reproduction. In reality, markets were rarely in equilibrium anyway (that was more a hypothesis used by economists, or a euphemism for \"price stability\"), and what explained the market behaviour of individuals and groups was precisely the imbalances between supply and demand propelling them into action. On this interpretation, capitalist development is always imbalanced development which, typically, the state tries to mitigate or compensate for.\n\nUnder capitalist conditions, balancing output and market demand depended on capital accumulation occurring. If profits were not made, production would stop sooner or later. A capitalist economy was therefore in \"equilibrium\" \"so long as it could reproduce its social relations of production, permitting profit-making and capital accumulation to occur\", but this was compatible with all sorts of market fluctuations and disequilibria. So long as workers were \"back to work\" each working day, maintaining the value of assets and creating new value, it was \"business as usual\". Only when shortages or oversupply began to threaten the existence of the relations of production themselves, and block the accumulation of capital in critical areas (for example, an economic depression, a political revolt against capitalist property or against mass unemployment), a genuine \"disequilibrium\" occurred; all the rest was just ordinary market fluctuations.\n\nReal social needs and their monetary expression through market demand might be two very different things. A demand might exist without any buying power, and it might be that more could technically be supplied, but isn't (see Capacity utilization). Economic equilibrium was not created by any perfect match of supply and demand, but by the social framework which permitted the balancing act to occur. The role of the political state was essential in this, to provide an enforced legal framework for fair trade, currency stability and secure property rights\n\nMarx himself regarded the idea that society was somehow balanced out by market trade as a typical figment of \"bourgeois ideology\" and he was a strong critic of Jean-Baptiste Say. In the real world, there was only a more or less haphazard adjustment of supply and demand through incessant price fluctuations. In reality, a lot of non-market activity was necessary to keep market activity going, and the role of the state was indispensable (for the security of private property, currency stability and the enforcement of trading obligations).\n\nThe law of value can interact with other phenomena which modify its effects. The 15 main factors counteracting the operation of the law of value, as a law governing the economic exchange of products, are the following:\n\nAll of these phenomena occur to some degree or other in any real economy. Hence the effect of the law of value would usually be mediated by them, and would manifest itself only as a tendency, or as a law of \"grand averages\".\n\nNevertheless, price-value divergences are typically quantitatively limited. Although the real cost structure of production can be distorted by all kinds of extraneous factors, the law of value places limits on the amount of the distortion. Even if goods sell at an abnormally low or high prices, that abnormality relates to a \"normal\" referent price, and it is precisely that price which, according to Marx, is constrained by the law of value, i.e. by the proportionalities of human labour-time reflected in the cost structure of products.\n\nMarx argues that, as economic exchange develops and markets expand while traditional methods of production are destroyed and replaced by commercial practices, the law of value is modified in its operation.\n\nThus, the capitalist mode of production is a type of economy, in which both inputs and outputs of production have become marketed goods and services (or commodities) which are bought and sold freely. Here, capitalists do not make money simply from trading or renting, but from the capitalization of production itself. Products and labour are purchased to manufacture new products which have a higher value in the market than their cost price, resulting in a profit from the added value. In such an economy, Marx argues, what directly regulates the economic exchange of new labour-products is not the law of value, but their prices of production. The theoretical problem which Marx then tries to tackle is how the movements of production prices across time are nevertheless regulated by the law of value. That was the problem which classical political economy failed to solve.\n\nThe production price is the price at which output would have to sell, in order to realize the average, normal rate of profit on the capital invested in producing that output. That is largely a matter of cost-prices, profit margins and sales turnover. If we find that the distribution of sale-prices for a given type of commodity converges on a particular normal price-level, then, Marx argues, the real reason is, that only at that price-level the commodity can be supplied at an acceptable or normal profit.\n\nIn pre-capitalist societies, where many inputs and outputs often weren't priced goods, but allocated \"by right\" or according to custom, the concept of an \"average production price\" would be rather meaningless. Large price differences existed even between towns, provinces and regions, yielding welcome profit to merchant traders. In capitalist society, differences in capital yields are constantly being leveled out by competition on a larger and larger scale, creating industry norms for normal returns on investments. The corollary in capitalist production is the increasingly free movement (or, at least, mobility) of labour and capital among branches of industry, in other words that capital and labour can be traded and shifted around fairly freely, with the aid of better transport and communication systems.\n\nIn \"Capital, Volume I\", Marx largely ignored price fluctuations for the given inputs and outputs of production. He assumed that the prices of commodities were equal to their values. There were, however, three main reasons for this simplification: \n\nThe fact that products can be traded above or below their value (and hence that more labour can exchange for less labour) became a fundamental theoretical problem for classical political economy. That is, the classical political economists failed theoretically to reconcile the law of value with unequal exchange (the exchange of unequal values). For Marx, the exchange of non-equivalents was not an aberration in the exchange process at all, but instead the pivot of business competition among producers in capitalist society. Price-value differences for labour-products determined how much of the new surplus value produced by enterprises, potentially contained in an output of commodities, could be realized as profit by those enterprises.\n\nCapitalist economic exchange, Marx argues (contrary to David Ricardo's theory), is not a simple exchange of equivalent values. It aims not to trade goods and services of equivalent value, but instead to make money from the trade (this is called capital accumulation). The aim is to buy as cheaply as possible, and sell as dear as possible, under the competitive constraint that everybody has the same objective. The effect is that the whole cost-structure of production permanently includes profit as an additional impost. In an overall sense, Marx argues the substance of this impost is the unpaid surplus labour performed by the working class; part of society can live off the labour of others due to their ownership of property.\n\nIn this situation, output values produced by enterprises will typically deviate from output prices realised. Market competition for a given demand will impose a ruling price-level for a type of output, but the different competing enterprises producing it will take more or less labour to produce it, depending on productivity levels and technologies they use. Consequently, output values produced by different enterprises (in terms of labour-time) and output prices realised by them will typically diverge (within certain limits): enterprises can get more or less income for the value of what they produce. That divergence becomes a critical factor in capitalist competition and the dynamics of the production system, under conditions where the average price-levels for products are beyond anyone's control.\n\nIf capital accumulation becomes the dominant motive for production, then producers will do everything they can to cut costs, increase sales and increase profits. Since they mostly lack control over the ruling market prices for their inputs and outputs, they try to increase productivity by every means at their disposal and maximise surplus labour. Because the lower the unit-costs of goods produced by an enterprise, the greater the margin will be between its own cost-prices and the ruling sale prices for those goods in the market, and therefore the larger the profits that can be realised as result when goods are sold. Producers thus become very concerned with the value added in what they produce, which depends crucially on productivity.\n\nIn the classical competitive situation, capitalists basically aim to employ workers to: \n\nSuch price-cutting competition is limited in scope however, because if competitors adopt the same production methods, the productivity advantage will disappear. In addition, beyond a certain point workers will begin to resist their exploitation, and they may join trade unions. And, if market prices for products were reduced to their most competitive cost-prices only, profits would fall to zero. This leads to constant attempts worldwide to improve production techniques to cut costs, improve productivity and hold down labour-costs, but ultimately also to a decline in the labor-content of commodities. Therefore, their values will also decline over time; more and more commodities are produced, for a larger and larger market, at an increasingly cheaper cost. Marx claims that this trend happens \"with the necessity of a natural law\"; producers had no choice about doing what they could in the battle for productivity, if they wanted to maintain or increase sales and profits. That was, in Marx's view, the \"revolutionary\" aspect of capitalism.\n\nCompetition among producers inexorably gives rise to market monopolies for products, which may constrain further significant advances in productivity and innovation. According to Marx, monopolies and competition always co-exist; monopolies in the production of goods and services are rarely permanent, and as soon as competition is blocked at one level, it reappears at another level. However, Marx never discussed all the different forms of economic competition in capitalist society. His main concern was to explain what the competition was ultimately about, and what structural factors were involved, from the point of view of the production system as a whole.\nThe negative influence of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall on business income could, Marx argued, be overcome in the long run only by organizing production and sales on a larger and larger scale, or by technological revolutions which reduced the cost of raw materials, labour and fixed equipment. That was capitalist progress. But to be able to compete in product markets in the end requires enormous amounts of investment capital, which (1) cuts out most would-be producers and (2) lowers the profit rate on investment capital. In turn, investors will no longer commit very large amounts of capital to investment projects if they are uncertain about whether those projects will yield an adequate return in the future. The more uncertainty there is, the more difficult it is to \"securitize\" (insure) their longer-term investments against losses of capital. If the state will not provide financial backing, private finance must provide it, but the latter is reluctant to do so if the risks outweigh the yields. This causes a powerful development of capital markets and supporting financial services, including shadow banking (credit facilities by non-bank organizations).\n\nIn a developed capitalism, the development or decline of the different branches of production occurs through the continual entry and exit of capital, basically guided by profitability criteria, and within the framework of competition. Where demand and profits are high, capital moves in, and when demand and profits are low, capital moves elsewhere. Thus, supply and demand are reconciled, however imperfectly, by the incessant migrations of capital across the economy. Yet, Marx argues, this whole process is nevertheless still regulated by the law of value; ultimately, relative price movements for products are still determined by comparative expenditures of labour-time. Thus, market prices for outputs will gravitate towards prices of production which themselves are constrained by product-values expressible in quantities of labour-time.\n\nIn serious economic crises, Marx suggests, the structure of market prices is more or less suddenly readjusted to the evolving underlying structure of production values. The economic crisis means that price and value relationships have gotten badly out of kilter, causing a breakdown of the normal trading process. According to Marx, the basic meaning of crises for capitalists was, that they could not longer invest their capital at an adequate profit income, which usually meant also that their capital lost part of its value. For workers, crises meant an increase in unemployment, and wage-cuts. Some output and assets might also be destroyed, because they could not be sold, or because they did not make money. Solving the crisis meant reorganizing production and trade, to meet the new requirements for profitable sales. Usually, crises were happening all the time somewhere in the capitalist economy, but those crises were limited to specific industries going bust – such crises normally did not spread to the whole economy. However, at some point, the crisis of particular branches of activity could set off a chain-reaction which would spread to the whole economy.\n\nMarx himself never developed a substantive theory of capitalist crises, beyond commenting about the economic crises he was able to observe himself. His main claim was that the crises are \"system-immanent\" (due to endogenous causes), and not an accidental aberration, i.e. they are a necessary feature of capitalist development. A large Marxist literature on \"crisis theory\" nowadays exists, in which different authors defend various ideas about the \"ultimate\" causes of capitalist crises (see also crisis theory) – basing themselves on a few scattered comments by Marx on the topic. Such theories are very difficult to prove scientifically, for five reasons: \n\nAccording to a popular Marxist interpretation, crises are the necessary result of the falling profitability of production capital, which, according to Marx, was an effect of rising overall productivity (raising the organic composition of production capital and lowering the value of commodities). But supposing that we can prove definitely that profitability did gradually decline across (say) 25 years, it is still not proved why a serious economic crisis would occur precisely at the end of that period, rather than (say) after 5 years, or 10 years, or 15 years. That is, by demonstrating an empirical profitability trend, the main causes and effects of the trend are not yet proved. In addition, production capital is a smaller and smaller fraction of the total mass of capital accumulated, and thus, it is not proved how the reduced profitability of only a minor part of the total capital can, by itself, throw the whole of capitalist society into crisis.\n\nWhat can be definitely proved, is that slumps have happened fairly regularly in the history of industrial capitalism from the 1820s onward, some being more severe than others. In the real economic history of capitalism, there is therefore no evidence of a spontaneous tendency toward economic equilibrium: capitalism develops spasmodically, through booms and slumps. Every crisis is supposed to be the last one, until a new crisis occurs. That was, for Marx, a good reason for doing away with the capitalist system, and bringing production under planned, collective control by the freely associated producers.\n\nMarx believed that the operation of the law of value was not only modified by the capitalist mode of production, but also in the world market (world trade, as contrasted with the home market or national economy).\n\nThe main reason for this was the existence of different levels of the intensity and productivity of labour in different countries, creating for example a very different cost structure in different countries for all kinds of products. Products that took 1 hour of labour to make in country A might take 10 hours to make in country B, a difference in production costs which could strongly influence the exchange values realised in the trade between A and B. More labour could, in effect, exchange for less labour internationally (an \"unequal exchange\" in value terms) for a prolonged time. In addition, the normal rate of surplus value could be different in different countries. That makes a huge difference not only to profitability, but to the ability to sell products at competitive prices.\n\nSo traders would try to use this differential to their advantage, with the usual motto \"buy cheap, sell dear\". This promotes the internationalization of business. The result, some Marxists argue, is an international transfer of value, from countries with a weaker bargaining position to those with a stronger one. The differential in labour valuations becomes a source of profit (see also global labor arbitrage).\n\nAmong German Marxists, Marx's fragmentary remarks on the law of value in a world market setting stimulated an important theoretical debate in the 1970s and early 1980s. One aim of this debate was to move beyond crude Ricardian interpretations of comparative advantage or comparative costs in explaining the pattern of world trade. To some extent similar debates took place in the US, France and Japan. In particular, when the volume of intra-industry trade (IIT) between countries grows (i.e. the same kinds of products are both imported and exported by a country), and when different branches of the same multinational import and export between countries with their own internal price regime, international comparative advantage theories of the Ricardian type do not apply.\n\nNowadays, Marxian scholars argue, comparative advantage survives mainly as an ideology \"justifying\" the benefits of international trade, not as an accurate \"description\" of that trade (some economists however draw subtle distinctions between comparative \"advantages\" and comparative \"costs\", while others switch to the concept of competitive advantage). Ultimately, the \"comparative advantage\" ideology is based on a very simple ideology about trade. This ideology says, that if everybody specializes in what they are the best at producing, this provides the greatest amount of wealth for everybody, because then everybody will be operating in the most efficient way. But this ideology is hopelessly naive. The simple reason is that, even if products are produced very efficiently, this says nothing about the terms on which products will be traded, and the incomes which producers will get for their work. They might work very efficiently, but get very little money for their effort.\n\nThe operation of the law of value in the world market might however seem rather abstract, in view of the phenomena of unequal exchange, differences in accounting norms, protectionism, debt-driven capital accumulation and gigantic differences in currency exchange rates between rich and poor countries. These phenomena can create very a significant distortion in world trade between final market prices for goods, and the real production costs for those goods, resulting in superprofit for the beneficiaries of the trade. The value and physical volume of manufactured exports by developing countries increased gigantically more than the actual income obtained by the producers. Third world nations relatively speaking received less and less for what they produced for sale in the world market, even as they produced more and more; this is also reflected in the international terms of trade for manufactured products.\n\nThe postulate of the law of value does however lead to the Marxian historical prediction that global prices of production will be formed by world competition among producers in the long term. That is, the conditions for producing and selling products in different countries will be equalised in the long run through global market integration; this will be reflected also in International Financial Reporting Standards. Thus globalisation means that incipiently the \"leveling out of differences in industrial rates of profit\" through competition begins to operate internationally. Trading ratios and exchange-values for products sold globally would thus become more and more similar, in the long term.\n\nThere has been a long debate among Marxists about whether the law of value also operates in non-capitalist societies where production is directed mainly by the state authorities. This debate occurred separately from the socialist calculation debate. There is still little agreement on the issue, because different Marxists use different definitions and concepts which are often influenced by political attitudes.\n\nIn his famous pamphlet \"Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR\", Joseph Stalin argued that the law of value did operate in the economy of the Soviet Union. Stalin was primarily concerned at the time with the problem of wasted labour, in an economy where workers often could not be easily fired (they had a constitutionally guaranteed right to a job, and there was considerable featherbedding of employees), and where there was often no clear relationship between salary-levels, work performance and actual output. The Stalin theory of the law of value was critically discussed by Włodzimierz Brus in \"The market in a socialist economy\".\n\nApart from Stalin, the most influential theorist of the law of value in the 20th century was Yevgeni Preobrazhensky. In his book \"The New Economics\" (1926, published in English in 1965), Preobrazhensky tried to specify clearly what the law of value should be understood to mean, for the purpose of economic policy. His main thesis was as such:\nThis influential analysis equated the law of value with market economy, and counterposed it to state-organized economy. There was, in other words, a structural conflict between the market principle and the collective planning principle. Preobrazhensky then aimed to show how state-organized economy could prevail over market forces in such a way, that the economic growth path would be optimal. His basic idea was that a tax on the millions of farmers in the Russian empire could finance urban industrialization. Preobrazhensky's approach to the law of value became the common assumption of left-wing Marxists discussing the transition to socialism, until the theorists of market socialism began to challenge it and gained more intellectual influence. According to Fred L. Block, nowadays \"Contemporary scholarship rejects the assumption...that state and market are distinct and opposing modes of organizing economic activity.\"\n\nSupporters of the theory of state capitalism in the Soviet Union (such as Tony Cliff and Chris Harman) and scholars such as Andre Gunder Frank have also believed that the law of value operated in Soviet-type societies. However, it is not always clear what they mean by the law of value, beyond the vague idea that the direct producers remain dominated by their own products, or that labour costs remain important, or that Soviet-type societies remained influenced by the world market. In 1979, Tony Cliff explained:\nMany Western Marxists reasoned that if workers were oppressed in the Soviet economy, the Soviet system could not be socialist, and that if it was not socialist, it must be capitalist – be it a special kind of capitalism, a capitalism mainly directed by the state. A similar theory was adopted in 1967 by the Chinese communists: after Stalin died in 1953, according to this theory, a sort of coup d'état had occurred in the Kremlin, which led to the \"restoration of capitalism\" throughout the USSR. The 1965 Soviet economic reform was interpreted as a proof of that theory. Some Western Maoists followed this interpretation. A 1977 resolution of the Bay Area Communist Union, an American Maoist group, stated that: \"In socialist society, commodity exchange, as well as value and the law of value continue to a certain extent. Only communism obliterates all aspects of commodity exchange, value, money, etc. However, one commodity does disappear under socialism: labor-power.\"\n\nFrom the 1930s to the 1950s, when Soviet industrialization seemed to be forging ahead, many Western Marxists theorized that Soviet state capitalism was a \"higher stage\" of capitalism than ordinary capitalism. But when it became very clear, in the 1980s, that Soviet economic growth was lagging behind the West, the Soviet state-capitalist stage was often reconceptualized as a \"lower\" stage of capitalism, which would in due course lead to \"ordinary\" capitalism (in Cliff's theory, all capitalisms in all countries are \"state capitalisms\" of one sort or another – some more developed, and others less developed).\n\nIn his famous book \"State capitalism in Russia\" (1948), Tony Cliff theorized that the law of value \"tends to equalise supply and demand, a situation in which price is equal to value, or more correctly, is equal to price of production.\" Although there seemed to him to be little internal evidence that the law of value regulated the Soviet economy, he believed the law of value was \"the arbiter of the Russian economic structure as soon as it is seen in the concrete historical situation of today—the anarchic world market.\" Critics of this interpretation argue that the Soviet economy was, in reality, rather autarkic (self-sufficient), that foreign trade was state-directed and played a comparatively small role in the economy as a whole, and that the foreign transactions were often non-commercial (often a form of barter, subsidized transfers or counter-trade).\n\nRudolf Hilferding regarded state capitalist theories as conceptually incoherent, because – he argued – the law of value presupposed market competition among private enterprises. If the allocation of resources was performed by a state dictatorship, there was no capitalism at all.\n\nAccording to Ernest Mandel, the law of value, as a law of exchange, did influence non-capitalist societies to some extent, inasmuch as exchange and trade persisted, but because the state directed the bulk of economic resources, the law of value no longer \"ruled\" or \"dominated\" resource allocation. The best proof of that was that there was mostly no clear relationship at all anymore between the exchange-value of goods traded, how they were allocated, and what it really cost to produce them; accounting information, insofar as it was valid, might in fact be unable to show anything about the real nature of resource allocation. The prices in the Soviet economy were, for the most part, not market prices but administered prices set by the planning boards (there was also a black market, mainly for consumer goods). Insofar as the social priorities of state policy ensured that people got what they needed, that was a good thing; but insofar as resources were wasted because of a lack of sensible cost-economies, it was a bad thing. Cost-accounting is, of course, no more \"neutral\" than profit-accounting; a lot depends on what costs are included and excluded in the calculation.\n\nMandel blamed the waste of resources in the Soviet economy on bureaucracy, and regarded the USSR as a bureaucratically degenerated workers' state. He believed that if there was genuine democracy instead of bureaucracy, there would be no more waste. Mandel's critics believe this is a naive theory because:\n\nCharles Bettelheim complained that Mandel lacked a \"dialectical synthesis\", because, in a somewhat Cartesian way, Mandel tried \"to deal with the complex reality of the transitional society by means of the simplest and most abstract categories of \"pure\" and fully developed socialist society.\" Other critics think the problem is rather different: it is that almost all Marxists have created a theoretical dichotomy between \"market economy\" and \"planned economy\", suggesting that \"either\" there is market anarchy, \"or else\" a planned, non-market economy. In the real world, such a dichotomy rarely exists—almost all economists agree that planning and markets are \"compatible\"; in fact they usually depend on each other. According to Peter Frase, \"The Market has been so mystified by its apologists that we no longer recognize a planned economy when we see it.\"\n\nIn socialist Cuba, Che Guevara adopted the view that if more resources were directly allocated to satisfy human needs, instead of commercially supplied, a better life for people would result. Guevara organised an interesting conference at which the theoretical issues were debated. At that time, Cuba benefited from plentiful subsidies by Eastern bloc countries, principally the Soviet Union, which compensated for the US trade boycott against Cuba. However, the Cuban Government defaulted on most of its international debt in 1986, reducing its access to foreign credit, and from 1989 the support of the Eastern Bloc disappeared, causing a steep decline in the Cuban national product. The Cuban economy was thereafter sustained to a large extent with foreign tourism, foreign remittances, foreign counter-trade and joint-ventures with foreign companies. In recent years, there have been a number of pro-market reforms, and attempts to reduce state-bureaucratic regulation. The modal standard of living and quality of life in Cuba is still among the best in Central and Latin America.\n\nGenerally, the Western New Left adopted the idea that true socialism would involve the abolition of the law of value, since commodity production would be abolished – goods and services would be allocated according to need, and primarily according to non-market principles. This recalled an idea by Nikolai Bukharin and Yevgeni Preobrazhensky in \"The ABC of Communism\" (1920):\n\nJohn Weeks has argued that the law of value is unique to an economy based on the capitalist mode of production. He rejects the claim by Engels that the law of value is associated with the entire history of economic exchange (trade), and modified when the vast majority of inputs and outputs of production have become marketed, priced commodities. Marx himself said that the law of value \"develops fully only on the foundation of capitalist production\", implying that the law of value already asserted itself \"before\" capitalist production, although not fully. Indeed, in a criticism of Adam Smith, Marx specifically refers to the law of value governing \"simple commodity exchange\"—the point being that this law is transformed in capitalist exchange where \"more labour is exchanged for less labour (from the labourer’s standpoint), less labour is exchanged for more labour (from the capitalist’s standpoint)\".\n\nOther Marxists (including Ernest Mandel, Michael Perelman and the Japanese scholar Kozo Uno) followed Marx and Engels in believing that the law of value emerges and develops from simple exchange based on simple commodity production. If the law of value was unique to capitalism, it becomes impossible to explain the development of pre-capitalist commodity exchange or the evolution of trading processes in a way consistent with historical materialism and Marx's theory of value. So a better approach, it is argued, is to regard the application of the law of value as being modified in the course of the expansion of trade and markets, including more and more of production in the circuit of capital. In that case, a specific society must be investigated to discover the regulating role that the law of value plays in economic exchange.\n\nIn contemporary Venezuela, the German socialist economist Heinz Dieterich has argued that the production and distribution of products should occur in accordance with their true labour costs, as shown by special macro-economic labour accounts estimating how much work-time products take to make (in socialism of the 21st century this is called \"equivalence economy\"). The idea here is that people \"get even\" when they get just as much work back, as they put in themselves.\n\nHowever, this argument is very controversial. Its critics claim equivalence economy is practically impossible, and some indeed point to Marx's rejection in the \"Grundrisse\" of the \"time-chit\" theory of allocating goods proposed by 18th and 19th century utopian socialists such as John Francis Bray and John Gray. On this view, Dieterich at most shows that the allocation of goods according to commercial principles is \"only one method\" of allocating resources; other methods such as sharing, redistribution, subsidization, barter, grants and direct allocation according to need may often serve the interest of fairness, efficiency and social justice better, provided that people accept a common ethic about what is best for all, if they can see that adopting such an ethic has good results. Thus, while integrated labour accounts are certainly useful to have as a planning tool, allocating resources according to the labour-time they represent is most likely not useful as a general economic principle (it could be useful in specific areas of activity).\n\nOne feasible alternative to Dieterich's labour-equivalents is a new type of digital credit system, in which people gain or lose credits (and therefore gain or lose access to resources) depending on what they verifiably do, and on what age they are. This alternative has not yet been very popular among socialist theorists, because generations of socialists have been educated in the idea that socialism aims to abolish monetary instruments, and because the idea seems to many to be too close to \"social-democratic subsidization\" or \"funny money\" social credit theories. Nevertheless, monetary transactions in modern capitalism are increasingly only digital credits and debits, the technology exists to make transactions by mobile phone, and more than 90% of all money in developed capitalist countries is bank money, not cash or cash deposits.\n\nThe international debate is still continuing. How progressive the Soviet Union really was is still being debated even today, for example by Bob Allen in his book \"Farm to factory.\" For some socialist economists, the socialist economy is an end in itself, for others it is only a means to an end. Some socialist theorists (such as Paul W. Cockshott) are \"monothetic theorists\": they wish the whole of the economy to be dominated by one economic principle, such as labour-value, or a few basic economic principles. Other socialist theorists (like Alec Nove) are \"pluralist theorists\", believing that the economy functions best if there is a variety of different systems for producing/distributing different kinds of products and services, using a variety of property forms.\n\nHistorical research is being done on the commons, often inspired by Elinor Ostrom. This is an attempt to understand empirically how people were able to manage land use collectively for 500 years or more, without significant state support or supervision. A frequent complaint in the discussion is that socialists, like their liberal and conservative counterparts, confuse an ethical principle of resource allocation (the \"why\") with the economic technique of resource allocation (the \"how\") – the result being an economic policy in which the means and the ends are confused.\n\nIn almost any society, market and non-market methods of allocating resources are in practice \"combined\", which is acknowledged in official national accounts by the inclusion of market and non-market sectors. The real question for economists is how the two can be combined to achieve the best economic result for citizens, and what the effect is of market and non-market methods on each other. This can be a highly politicized and contentious dispute, since the chosen methods can advantage some and disadvantage others; it is very difficult to devise allocation methods which distribute the gains and losses of economic policy in an equal or equitable way among all economic actors.\n\nTypically, pro-capitalist theorists argue that \"there is no alternative to the market\", and the anti-capitalists argue that markets \"could not even exist\" without many non-market mechanisms and supports (i.e. marketisation merely shifts the burden of unpaid work effort onto someone else). Almost all modern economies are \"mixed economies\" meaning that they combine market allocation of resources with non-market allocation, in various ways. That is why the modern economic controversies are almost always about the relative importance which different kinds of allocation mechanisms should have. This debate is, of course, very strongly influenced by the income which the different economic actors can get, if particular economic policies are realized.\n\nTraditionally, criticism of Marx's law of value has been of three kinds, i.e. conceptual, logical and empirical.\n\nThe conceptual criticism concerns the concept of value itself.\n\nFor Marx, economic value in capitalist society was an objectified social characteristic of labour-products, exchanged in an economic community, given the physical reality that products took a definite amount of society's labour-time to produce, for a given demand. A product had a value, regardless of what any particular person might think about it, priced or unpriced (see value-form). Marx regarded the law of value as analogous to an objective physical law, since people could never escape from the fact that the products they consumed presupposed an objective cost in human labour time. Critics however argue that economic value is something purely subjective, i.e. a personal valuation determined by personal preferences and marginal utility; only prices are objective. One of the first Marx-critics to argue this was the Austrian Eugen Böhm von Bawerk. Marx himself never denied that subjective valuations existed, but argued rather that they \"co-existed\" with objective values which were ultimately not determined by preferences but by real production costs.\n\nIn the real world, many prices are not \"objectively manifest\" either—they are only ideal prices used for the purpose of calculation, accounting and estimation, not actually charged or applying directly to any real transaction. Yet, these notional prices can nevertheless influence economic behaviour, inasmuch as the prices estimated affect expectations of incomes and expenditures. Economists then debate about when a price can be said to be \"objective\".\n\nMarx argues that products have different objective costs of production, reducible to different amounts of labour-time. Against this view, one could also argue that the physical amounts of \"comparable resources\" (such as energy, land, water, etc.), necessary to manufacture a car, are much larger than resources necessary for growing a carrot, explaining why the cost (and, hence, minimal price) of a car is larger than the cost of a carrot. In other words, it is the total input costs (including costs of labour), not the amount of labour per se, which create the difference in costs (and, therefore minimal equilibrium prices) of the goods. However, Marx argues in the first chapters of \"Das Kapital\" that most of such costs (i.e. insofar as they refer to reproducible goods) are again reducible to direct and indirect costs in human labour time. When we see a car, we do not see the worldwide cooperation of labour-efforts that produced it at a certain cost, yet those labour efforts, weighed against other labour efforts, determine its value.\n\nAustrian economics explicitly rejects the \"objectivity\" of the values of goods as logically and conceptually unsound. On this view, we cannot validly say that products took a certain amount of labour, energy and materials to make, and compare them on that basis. It follows that the Austrian School thinks most contemporary economic theory is invalid, as it relies in one way or another on the aggregation and comparison of actual and ideal prices. This is forcefully argued by Friedrich von Hayek who therefore was skeptical about the objectivity of macroeconomic aggregations as such. However, this raises the question of \"what is the explanatory power of Austrian economics\", if all we can say about a realized price is that it expresses a subjective preference, given that there are billions of subjective preferences which are all different.\n\nEcologists and environmentalists have criticized Marx on the ground that natural resources have (or should have) a value which has nothing to do with production costs in labour time, because in fact they are entropic \"non-reproducible\" goods. However, Marx himself never denied this; he was merely referring to the \"bourgeois\" valuation scheme, originating from commercial trade, double-entry bookkeeping, private property theory and the theory of prices. Precisely \"because\" natural resources were for a long time either non-reproducible or freely available goods (i.e. not reproducible commodities) the whole tendency in the market economy was for those resources to be \"plundered\" for private gain, rather than economized appropriately. Their \"value\" became apparent only when they became scarce.\n\nEcologists also note that Marxist theories of value caused large-scale environmental problems in the industrialization of the Soviet Union, China and other countries ruled by communist parties; thus, whether or not an economy is a market economy or a state economy does not seem to make much difference, the problem is rather with the values of human cultures themselves or with industrialization processes as such. This more complex debate cannot be dealt with in this article; it may be noted only that newly industrializing countries to a large extent \"imitated\" technical methods used in industrialized countries, and that Marx can hardly be held responsible for all the things done in his name—he had explicitly referred to problems of environmental despoilation quite a number of times, including in \"Das Kapital\". He never dealt systematically with socialist economics, amongst other things because he lacked an evidential basis for theorizing about that.\n\nThe logical criticism revolves around the idea that Marx is unable to reconcile the domain of value relations and the domain of price relations, showing exactly how value \"magnitudes\" correspond to price \"magnitudes\".\n\nVarious arguments are made to show that Marx's theory of value is \"logically\" incoherent. The most famous of these is the controversy about Marx's prices of production, sometimes called the transformation problem in which it is argued that total output value must equal total output production prices, and total profits must equal total surplus value, so that the distributions of particular output values and output prices can then be \"inferred\" from each other, via mathematical functions and a tidy accounting sum, assuming the same rate of profit on capital invested by all sectors. However, it cannot be proved, whether logically or empirically, that the total output value is equivalent to total output production prices, or, for that matter, that total profit equals total surplus-value. On that ground alone, many critics argue, there is already no proof that there is any necessary quantitative relationship between them (Marx simply assumes that relationship, but does not prove it). If that is so, then, the critics argue, there is no sense in which the Marxian product-values can \"explain\" market prices for products as the \"determinants\" of those prices. An additional problem discovered in mathematical modelling is that the assumption of the identity of total production prices and total values (or the identity of total surplus value and total profits) cannot be maintained simultaneously with the assumption that the rate of profit on production capital is \"the same\" for all industries—to create a consistent theory requires making additional assumptions.\n\nAlthough this is often overlooked by economists Marx himself used a uniform rate of profit for all industries in \"Capital Vol. 3\" \"only\" for modelling purposes, to show in a simple way how the ruling profit rates on capital impacted on the development of production system, and he explicitly \"denied\" that a uniform rate of profit obtained in reality; he only argued that at any time there would exist an average \"\"minimum acceptable\"\" profit rate on capital invested in industries, and if there was no realistic possibility at all of reaching at least that profit rate sometime in the future, capital would very likely be disinvested after a while, since the relevant business would then simply lack commercial viability; alternatively, the business would be taken over, and restructured to restore an acceptable profit rate. This minimum profit rate applying to new investments is closely linked to the \"ruling interest rates\" applicable to producing enterprises. Marx's \"general rate of profit\" specifically represents the \"minimum profit rate\" on capital, below which the producers, in the normal run of events, cannot stay in business for long. It is \"neither\" an empirical average of many profit rates, \"nor\" merely a theoretical ratio, but a real systemic constraint.\n\nMarx and Engels explicitly denied that \"in reality\" total product-value would be equal to the total of production prices (see prices of production). Such an \"accounting identity\" was ruled out in the real world by continual variations in labour productivity and because, at any time, no competitive force existed that could exactly cancel out the difference between goods sold above value and goods sold below value. It was also ruled out by the imperfections of the price-form itself, which, the fetishization of price statistics notwithstanding, permitted the expression of product-values only in an approximate way (see real prices and ideal prices). At best—Marx assumed—there was a reasonably close correspondence between total product-value and total production prices. He believed economic fluctuations implied that if some products were sold below their value, this necessarily meant that other products were sold above their value, and vice versa.\nThe divergence between total product-values and total production prices on the whole was, Marx believed, probably not so very large, in an open, competitive market within the domestic economy, where enormous price-value discrepancies were ordinarily impossible to maintain commercially for any length of time.\n\nA measuring unit of value can exist only as a \"theoretical\" entity (or as an ideal price comparable to an empirical price) which is also exactly how Marx used it in his simplified illustrations of value relationships. He simply uses a number for the value-quantity and another number for the price-quantity, to indicate a proportion. Empirically, one can only get as far as establishing a \"grand average\" for the price of an hour of work (this is often referred to in Marxian economics as the \"monetary equivalent of labour time\", or MELT) and one can discuss the extent to which labour is undervalued or overvalued in a \"relative\" (comparative) sense. This interpretation is not accepted by all Marxist scholars, because—the critics argue—all price-value differentials among different outputs are \"necessarily\" and \"by definition\" cancelled out at the aggregate level, not just in an assumed theoretical model, but in reality. They point to passages where Marx suggests that the sum of product-values must be equal to the sum of production prices, implying that there can never be more new product-value or less product-value than is expressed by the sum total of output production prices. If they argue that equality does not hold, then there cannot be any determinate quantitative relationship between production prices and product-values.\n\nProduct-\"values\" in Marx's sense quite simply \"cannot\" be directly observed, only \"inferred\" from the actual behaviour of trading relations. In that regard, Marx's concept of \"\"value\" has exactly the same status as the official category of \"value added\" (which is an inferred magnitude). Product-values manifest themselves and can only be \"expressed\" as trading ratios, (ideal) prices, or quantities of labour-time, and therefore the academic \"transformation controversy\" is according to many modern Marxist theorists \"misguided\"; it rests simply on a false interpretation of the relationship between the value-form of commodities and the price-form. What Marx really meant by the \"transformation\" was that the direct regulation of the exchange-value of commodities according to their labour-value is, in a capitalist mode of production, transformed into the regulation of the exchange of commodities by their production prices—reflecting the fact, that the supply of commodities in capitalist society has become conditional on the accumulation of capital, and therefore on profit margins (\"no profit, no sale\"). As soon as we admit that product-prices may fluctuate above or below the socially average product-values for all kinds of reasons—a central determinant of market dynamics—the quantitative relationship between product-values and product-prices is at best \"probabilistic\", not a fixed function of some type. The structure of Marx's argument in \"Capital Vol. 3\" is that there is a constant \"contradiction\" in capitalism between the inescapable labour-costs incurred to produce products, and the laws of price competition which create pressure to maximize the return on capital invested—a contradiction which must constantly be mediated in practice, bringing about the \"real movement\" of the production system (ideally, capitalists would prefer just to trade assets without the nuisance and trouble of hiring labor, but the assets have to be \"produced\", that production requires \"labor\", and therefore that labor has to be \"organized\" in a commercially effective way).\n\nThe only way to transcend the scientific \"arbitrariness\" to which the young Marx already referred, was by understanding and theorizing the dynamics of the capitalist system \"as a whole\", integrating all the different economic forces at work into a unified, coherent theory that could withstand the test of scientific criticism. Thus, Marx's value \"theory\" offers an interpretation, generalisation or explanation concerning the \"grand averages\" of the relative price movements of products, and of economic behaviour in capitalist production as a social system, but it is not possible to deduce specific real product-prices from product-values according to some mathematical function, among other things because, to find labour-values, a relationship between product-prices and labour hours worked must already be assumed. What we \"can\" verify is as follows:\n\nThe empirical criticism is that Marx's law of value contradicts the known facts about the allocation of resources in capitalist society.\n\nThe main empirical criticism is simply that there is no observable quantitative correspondence at all between changes in relative expenditures of labour-time, and changes in relative market prices of products, however measured (the measures are also contested, for example on the ground that qualitatively different kinds of labour cannot be compared and equated). Most critics have tried to refute Marx's theory with a mathematical model, rather than looking at real data to see if the capitalist economy really behaves in the way Marx claims it does.\n\nA recent empirical criticism has to do with what Marxists call \"financialization\". In developed capitalist economies, the majority of workers and capital assets no longer directly participate in the production of new commodities by private enterprise. Many workers work in service industries which manage, maintain or distribute already existing resources. That is the result of two centuries of industrialization and mechanization in developed capitalist countries (plus outsourcing to newly industrializing economies). The bulk of capital assets in developed capitalist countries are not physical means of production used by private enterprise to create new commodities; they are financial assets, real estate and other types of property not used for production. This means that human labour is no longer regarded as the mainspring of wealth-creation, and it raises the question of how the law of value could, in that case, be a regulative force in the allocation of resources, or how it could determine prices. According to Professor Hillel Ticktin:\n\nThis issue has not yet been resolved, because there is little scientific agreement about how the \"real economy\" (producing goods and services) and the \"financial economy\" (trading property and assets) are related to each other, or how the \"developed world\" is related economically to the \"developing world\". Because \"globalization\" can mean almost anything, it does not explain anything about the world economy. Additionally, although Marxists have written many articles in which they very precisely try to classify productive and unproductive labour, there has been no comprehensive organizational analysis of the modern division of labour, or a critical analysis of the statistical categories used to understand it.\n\nThese three lines of criticism lead the critics to the conclusion that Marx's law of value is metaphysical and theoretically useless.\n\nAustrian economics goes a step further by attributing no special objective meaning to price levels at all, which it considers a mere \"statistical outcome\" of comparisons between each party's ratios between the value of money (taken to be just another kind of a good) to values of goods being sold or purchased. The prices, therefore, are \"knowledge\", which may (or may not) influence behaviour of economic agents differently \"in each particular case\". However, it can be argued that this approach is inconsistent, insofar as nothing in their theory entitles the Austrians to aggregate prices at all; \"because\" each price expresses a unique subjective preference, adding up prices is like adding up apples and pears; each price refers to a unique set of circumstances. If the Austrians are correct, there can really be nothing \"objective\" about the \"statistical outcome\"—it is merely an interpretation based on numerous valuation assumptions.\n\nMarx himself thought that the concept of value was necessary to explain the historical origins, the development and mode of functioning of capitalism as a social system, under conditions where traded, priced assets were only a subset of total assets possessing a potential exchange-value. Short-term price fluctuations could not say anything about the long-term development of the capitalist production system; that required an analysis of the determinants of long-term average price movements, and \"structural\" factors. According to primitive economics, all prices are of the \"same kind\" and differ only quantitatively; they only express more or less money, and can only go up or down. For Marx, this idea was not only false, but totally absurd, since different kinds of prices can assume different valuation principles, contractual obligations, conditionalities, inclusions/exclusions as well as relationships between economic actors. Different kinds of prices express different kinds of trading relationships. Marx noted that the forms prices take are highly \"variegated\", and he drew a sharp distinction between real prices and ideal prices. That is why businessmen assumed a theory of value, even if they were not aware that they were doing it. The \"scientific theory\" merely made explicit what they were implicitly assuming for the purpose of doing business.\n\nThe economists \"assumed\" all sorts of things about an economy and economic actors, in order to build models of price behaviour; Marx thought \"those assumptions themselves\" needed to be looked at and theorised consistently, based on insight into the historical formation of economic categories. However, his critics claim that his own approach has hidden assumptions as well, and that these assumptions contradict praxeology. Marx anticipated this criticism, which he regarded as very shallow. In his pamphlet \"Wages, price and profit\" (1865), Marx argues that the way economic relationships observably appear to the individual is often the inverse of the real process, considered as a whole. It is perfectly possible not only to participate in market trade without much knowledge of markets and their overall effects, but also to participate in markets with a \"false\" or \"one-sided\" interpretation of what is really going on in the exchanges. After all, the participants in trading activity all have their own interest in the matter, and look at it from their own point of view. In this sense, Marx warns that market trade can stimulate all sorts of delusions about what relationships are really involved. Marx also argued that if one could not explain the simplest cases of an economic phenomenon, one could not explain all its variations either; in fact, one could not explain anything at all.\n\nMarxists often assumed that Marx provided a theoretical system of what they call \"the totality\" (the whole economy, or the whole of society). In reality, Marx only aimed to portray the essence of capital, by means of a study of the capitalist mode of production in Western Europe (using illustrations from English industry). According to historical materialism, production is the basis of society, and Marx analyzed that basis. Marxists have also often assumed wrongly that Marx's abstract theory can be applied \"directly\" and \"immediately\" to observable reality. Yet Marx's historical and logical analysis of economic forms is often an \"abstraction from\" observable reality. It is an analysis which only aims to define the \"essence\" of economic phenomena (i.e. what their true or overall significance is), based on a critical inspection of the evidence. Thus, Marx often offers only a \"simplified\" or \"idealized\" account of economic phenomena. The largest part of Marx's economic writings was never published in his lifetime, and was never prepared for publication by Marx himself. The ideology of \"Marxism\" was formed already long before all the facts and all the texts became available, which meant that Marx the man, his life and his work were frequently interpreted in a false way.\n\n"}

Lat., \"God wills this\"). The two first variants, incorrect in Classical Latin, are forms influenced by Romance languages. According to , the articles 'lo' or 'le' were very likely part of the original motto as shouted in Amalfi, as both the author of \"Gesta Francorum\" and that of \"Historia Belli Sacri\" report it. Historian Louis Bréhier notes that the \"Gesta Francorum\" is written in a language situated between Latin, Old French and Old Italian. \n\nThe battle cry of the First Crusade is reported in the \"Gesta Francorum\", which was written by an anonymous author who was associated with Bohemond I of Antioch shortly after the successful campaign, in 1100 or 1101. According to this description, as the Princes Crusade gathered in Amalfi in the late summer of 1096, there assembled a large number of crusaders, armed and bearing the sign of the cross on their right shoulders or on their backs, crying in unison \"\"Deus le volt, Deus le volt, Deus le volt\"\". The \"Historia belli sacri\", written somewhat later, c. 1131, also cites the battle cry.\n\nThe battle cry is again mentioned in the context of the capture of Antioch on 3 June 1098. The anonymous author of the \"Gesta\" was himself among the soldiers capturing the wall towers, and recounts that \"seeing that they were already in the towers, they began to shout \"Deus le volt\" with glad voices; so indeed did we shout\".\n\nRobert the Monk in c. 1120 re-wrote the \"Gesta Francorum\" because it was considered too \"rustic\". He added an account of the speech of Urban II at the Council of Clermont, of which he was an eyewitness. The speech climaxes in Urban's call for orthodoxy, reform, and submission to the Church. Robert records that the pope asked western Christians, poor and rich, to come to the aid of the Greeks in the east:\n\nWhen Pope Urban had said these and very many similar things in his urbane discourse, he so influenced to one purpose the desires of all who were present, that they cried out, 'It is the will of God! It is the will of God!' When the venerable Roman pontiff heard that, with eyes uplifted to heaven he gave thanks to God and, with his hand commanding silence, said: Most beloved brethren, today is manifest in you what the Lord says in the Gospel, \"Where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them.\" Unless the Lord God had been present in your spirits, all of you would not have uttered the same cry. For, although the cry issued from numerous mouths, yet the origin of the cry was one. Therefore I say to you that God, who implanted this in your breasts, has drawn it forth from you. Let this then be your war-cry in combats, because this word is given to you by God. When an armed attack is made upon the enemy, let this one cry be raised by all the soldiers of God: It is the will of God! It is the will of God!\n\nRobert also reports that the cry of \"Deus lo vult\" was at first shouted in jest by the soldiers of Bohemund during their combat exercises, and later turned into an actual battle cry, which Bohemund interpreted as a divine sign.\n\n\"Deus lo vult\" is the motto of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, a Roman Catholic order of chivalry (restored 1824).\n\nAdmiral Alfred Thayer Mahan, a Protestant Episcopalian, used the expression for his argument of \"the dominion of Christ\" as \"essentially imperial\" and that \"Christianity and warfare\" had a great deal in common: Deus vult!' say I. It was the cry of the Crusaders and of the Puritans and I doubt if man ever uttered a nobler [one].\"\n\nGeorge Flahiff CSB in 1947 used \"Deus Non Vult\" as the title of an examination of the gradual loss of enthusiasm for the crusades at the end of the 12th century, specifically of the early criticism of the crusades by Ralph Niger, writing in 1189.\n\nDisseminated in the form of hashtags and internet memes, \"Deus vult\" has enjoyed popularity with members of the alt-right because of its perceived representation of the clash of civilizations between the Christian West and the Islamic world. Crusader memes, such as an image of a Knight Templar accompanied by the caption \"I’ll see your jihad and raise you one crusade\", are popular on hard-right internet pages\".\" The motto is also used by nationalist groups in Europe and was portrayed on large banners during marches celebrating the Polish National Independence Day in 2017.\n\n\n"}

It is an off-west end studio theatre.\n\nJermyn Street opened in August 1994. Formerly the changing rooms for staff at the Spaghetti House restaurant, it was transformed under the leadership of Howard Jameson and Penny Horner into a 70-seat studio theatre. They both remain the Chair of the Board and Executive Director respectively. In 1995, Neil Marcus became the first Artistic Director and Jermyn Street received their Lottery Grant in 1997. During this time, producer Chris Grady contributed to Jermyn Street Theatre’s development. Princess Michael of Kent became the theatre’s patron in 1995 and David Babani, later the founder of the Menier Chocolate Factory, took over as artistic director in 1998 until 2001.\n\nJermyn Street Theatre has become a staple of London’s off-west end studio theatre. It received a lot of attention following successful productions of \"Barefoot in the Park\" directed by Sally Hughes and starring Alan Cox and Rachel Pickup, and \"Helping Harry\" directed by Nickolas Grace and starring Adrian Lukis and Simon Dutton. In the late 2000s, under the artistic direction of Gene David Kirk, Jermyn Street expanded its repertoire to include revivals of obscure plays such as the UK premiere of \"St John’s Night\" by Henrik Ibsen, \"Little Eyolf\" starring Imogen Stubbs and Doreen Mantle by Henrik Ibsen, and the postwar classic \"The River Line\" by Charles Morgan. Samuel Beckett’s \"All That Fall\", premiered at Jermyn Street Theatre in 2012, directed by Trevor Nunn and starring Eileen Atkins and Michael Gambon. It then transferred to the Arts Theatre and later would transfer to the New York’s 59E59 Theatre In 2011, Jermyn Street Theatre received a Peter Brook Empty Space Award nomination. One year later, the theatre won The Stage 100 Best Fringe Theatre.\n\nFollowing the rising success of Jermyn Street Theatre under the artistic direction of Gene David Kirk was Anthony Biggs who took over as Artistic Director in 2013. He focused on international playwrights and new works. During Biggs’ time, Jermyn Street Theatre produced a repertory season of South African drama and new works by Jonathan Lewis (\"A Level Playing Field)\"\",\" Sarah Daniels (\"Soldiers’ Wives)\"\",\" and American playwright Rae Spiegel \"(Dry Land)\"\".\" Biggs also revived \"The First Man\" by American playwright Eugene O’Neill, First World War drama \"Flowers of the Forest\" by John Van Druten, and \"First Episode\", Terence Rattigan’s first play, directed by Tom Littler.\n\nIn 2017, Tom Littler became Artistic Director. His first production was the world premiere of Howard Brenton’s \"The Blinding Light\"\".\" This marked the sixth production Littler has directed at Jermyn Street Theatre. Previous credits include praised revivals of Stephen Sondheim’s \"Anyone Can Whistle\" and \"Saturday Night\" which transferred to the Arts Theatre. Since Tom Littler’s appointment as Artistic Director, Jermyn Street Theatre has been re-launched into a full-scale producing theatre, with eight to ten productions making up an annual season. The theatre’s creative output is focused on staging new plays, rare revivals, innovative adaptations of European classics, and outstanding musicals, alongside one-off literary events. Jermyn Street Theatre is committed to ensuring that at least fifty percent of all on stage and off stage creatives are women.\n\nIn 2018, Littler directed the first complete West End revival of Noel Coward’s Tonight at 8.30, featuring a cast of nine actors playing 73 roles.

It is located at the corner of Fourth Avenue and Union Street in Brooklyn, New York City, serving the communities of Park Slope, Gowanus and Carroll Gardens. It is served by the R train at all times. The D and N trains also stop here during late nights, and some rush-hour W trains stop here in the peak direction.\n\nThe Union Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905. Construction on the segment of the line that includes Union Street started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in September 1912. The station opened on June 22, 1915 as part of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to 59th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1926–1927, and again during a renovation in 1968–1970. The station was also renovated in 1970 and in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe Union Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, the plan for which was initially adopted on June 1, 1905. The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded on July 1, 1907, by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC), which approved the plan for the line in late 1907. The contract for the section of the line that included the Union Street station, Route 11A2, which extended from 10th Street to Sackett Street, was awarded on May 22, 1908, to E.E. Smith Construction Company for $2,296,234.93 (). The New York City Board of Estimate approved the contract on October 29, 1909. Construction on the segment started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in September 1912.\n\nAs part of negotiations between New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT. The agreement, known as Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, was signed on March 19, 1913. Union Street opened on June 22, 1915, as part of an extension of the subway to Coney Island station, which included the Fourth Avenue Line north of 59th Street as well as the entire Sea Beach Line. The station's opening was marked with a competition between two trains heading from Chambers Street station in Manhattan to the Coney Island station, one heading via the West End Line and the other via the Sea Beach Line; the latter got to Coney Island first.\n\nOn June 27, 1922, the New York State Transit Commission directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at 23 stations on the lines of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the successor to the BRT, to accommodate eight-car trains. As part of the project, Union Street's platforms would have been lengthened from to . Though the Transit Commission ordered the BMT to lengthen these platforms in September 1923, progress on the extensions did not occur until February 16, 1925, when the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at this and eleven other stations along the Fourth Avenue Line. It estimated the project's cost to be $633,000 (). The NYCBOT received bids for the project on February 25, 1926. The contract was awarded to Corson Construction Company for $345,021 (). The extensions opened on August 1, 1927.\n\nIn July 1959, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) announced that it would install fluorescent lighting at the Union Street station and five other stations along Fourth Avenue for between $175,000 and $200,000. Bids on the project were to be advertised on August 7, 1959 and completed by fall 1960.\n\nIn the 1960s, the NYCTA started a project to lengthen station platforms on its lines in Southern Brooklyn to to accommodate 10-car trains. On July 14, 1967, the NYCTA awarded a contract to conduct test borings at eleven stations on the Fourth Avenue Line, including Union Street, to W. M. Walsh Corporation for $6,585 () in preparation of the construction of platform extensions. The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on the project to extend the platforms at stations along the Fourth Avenue Line between Pacific Street and 36th Street, including those at Union Street, on March 28, 1969. The contract was awarded to Horn Construction Company on May 13, 1969 for $7,381,890. Funding for the renovation projects came out of the NYCTA's 1969–1970 Capital Budget, costing $8,177,890 in total.\n\nAs part of the renovation project, the station's platforms were extended to the north, and the station's elaborate mosaic tile walls were covered over with white cinderblock tiles. The latter change, which was also made to 15 other stations on the BMT Broadway and Fourth Avenue Line, was criticized for being dehumanizing. The NYCTA spokesman stated that the old tiles were in poor condition and that the change was made to improve the appearance of stations and provide uniformity. Furthermore, it did not consider the old mosaics to have \"any great artistic merit\".\n\nThe station was renovated again from 1991 to 1994. The $2.397 million contract for the project was awarded on February 28, 1991. During the closure of the Bay Ridge-bound platform, the glazed tiles at the station were heavily defaced with graffiti, and were cleaned prior to the station's reopening with a heavy duty cleaner, which damaged the glazing. A modification to the contract was approved on May 23, 1994. As part of the modification, new graffiti resistant ceramic tile was installed, signage, advertising panels, benches and trash bins were removed and reinstalled, exhaust systems were added in the porter rooms at both platforms, and the wall-mounted conductors board was replaced by a ceiling-mounted one. The modification cost $174,000, and change orders cost $111,004. The Brooklyn-bound platform was closed between July 15 and November 15, 1991, while the Manhattan-bound platform was closed between February 19 and June 20, 1992.\n\nIn addition to upgrading the same elements that were replaced in the previous overhaul, floors and track wall tiling, the public announcement system, and safety treads along platform edges and track-beds were replaced. It also included an art installation by Emmett Wigglesworth called \"CommUnion\". It features twenty-two panels of various designs in the recessed area of the platform tiles above the station signs and other designs on the openings in the track walls.\n\nAs part of the 2015–2019 Metropolitan Transportation Authority Capital Program, $300 million was allocated to enhance station access and provide ADA-accessibility at 15 stations chosen by New York City. Four stations were being evaluated for such improvements, including the Union Street station.\n\nThis underground station has four tracks and two side platforms. The R stops here at all times; some rush-hour W trains stop here in the peak direction; and the D and N stop here during late nights, but use the center express tracks to bypass the station during daytime hours. A white tiled curtain wall separates the express tracks from the local tracks.\n\nBoth platforms are columnless except for a section at their extreme north ends, where they were extended in 1970 to accommodate 10-car trains. Here, the columns are cream colored I-beams. The ceiling is lower in this section.\n\nPrior to the station's 1970 renovation, it was finished all in white and marble tile, and it had its own color scheme to allow regular passengers to identify the station based only on the color of the marble trimmings. Since the renovation, the station walls have consisted of white cinderblock tiles, except for small recesses in the walls, which contain gray-painted cinderblock tiles. The gray cinderblock field contains the station-name signs and white text pointing to the exits.\n\nEach platform has one same-level fare control area in the center and there are no crossovers or crossunders to allow free transfer between directions. The Manhattan-bound side has a fare control area, a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The stairs on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the southeast corner of Union Street and Fourth Avenue while those on the Bay Ridge-bound platform goes up to the southwest corner. The Bay Ridge-bound side has a fare control area, a turnstile bank without a token booth, and two street stairs.\n\n"}

The district offers classes from kindergarten to grade 12.\n\nAs of May 2017, the district had an enrollment of 4,743 and serves an area of .\n\n\n\n\nCheney School District was established in 1887, four years after the incorporation of the city. William J. Sutton served as the first principal. By 1960, Cheney encompassed the largest area of any school district in the state of Washington. The district serves residents in a area, comparable to the size of Dallas, accumulating annually on 47 buses.\n\nCheney School District administration was based in the Fisher Building from 1977 to 2012, formerly built as Cheney High School in 1930. In 2012, administrators moved into the site on Andrus Road, a former Nike missile facility designated F-37 (for the defense of nearby Fairchild Air Force Base) which the district had purchased for $29,000 in 2009.\n\nPresent-day Eastern Washington University (EWU) started as the Benjamin P. Cheney Academy in 1882 and when Washington gained its statehood in 1889, became the Washington State Normal School at Cheney. As part of the normal school's mission to train prospective teachers, a separate Campus School was established in 1892 to facilitate instruction of education students and student teaching of children. A separate building for the Training School was completed in 1908, funded by a $65,000 appropriation. In 1912, a fire destroyed the main building of the Normal School, and the Training School building was appropriated for Normal School classes, with Training School being held temporarily in an 1893 building owned by Cheney Public Schools. A new building, named Martin Hall (after Governor Clarence D. Martin), was completed for the Training School in 1937 at a cost of $284,000. The old Training School building was condemned and demolished in 1940. The Campus or Training School changed its name to the Laboratory School in 1937 with the move to Martin Hall.\n\nThe modern building for the Laboratory School, named the Robert Reid Lab School, was built in 1959 immediately west of Martin Hall as a laboratory school at a construction cost of $363,754 for the structure and $41,950 for the land. EWU operated Reid as a separate school district (No. 365) until the 1986–87 academic year, when it began to be jointly operated by the Cheney School District and EWU. EWU was responsible for the costs of operation, and Cheney School District provided teaching staff and equipment. When parents, faculty members, and education students learned that Reid may be closed as other campus capital projects held higher priorities, they held a march in 2007 in protest. Reid retained features unique to laboratory schools, such as one-way glass, microphones, and observation towers to allow education students to observe classes in session with minimal disruption. Following the 2008–09 academic year, Reid was permanently closed as the required overhauls could not be funded as the building was owned by Eastern, not Cheney School District, and few student teachers were using the facilities. The building was demolished in 2015 to make way for new science facilities on campus.\n\nWith the incorporation of several neighboring school districts in 1929, existing school buildings were expected to be overcrowded due to the influx of new students. A plan was presented to local voters proposing that an existing school building (built in 1893) would be demolished and its bricks salvaged to create a new high school at the same site (520 4th St), to cost no more than $125,000. The first event in the new three-story high school was a basketball game, held on January 7, 1930; classes started approximately two weeks later, on January 22.\n\nA new high school was built at 460 N. 6th in 1966, and the 1930 building was repurposed to serve as the junior high school until 1977, when the new Cheney Junior High opened on the edge of town. At that point, the building (then renamed the Fisher Building in honor of educator and Cheney mayor George Fisher) served the district as administrative offices and for special functions until 2013. The building was declared surplus and sold to a developer in 2014. One of the first developers to express interest in the Fisher Building was Cheney alumnus and former NFL player Steve Emtman.\n\nAfter several failed sale attempts, the Fisher Building was sold to a Seattle developer and converted to Multi Family Housing called the \"School House Lofts\" in 2017, with 36 apartments aimed at students attending neighboring Eastern Washington University. Portions of the building were preserved in their original configuration, including half the gym and a portion of the balcony on the gym's perimeter. The buyer of the Fisher Building, Eastmark Properties, placed the building on the Cheney Historic Register before finalizing the sale, enabling it to take advantage of tax credits for refurbishing historic buildings.\n\nTwo identical buildings were completed in 2012 to serve as Cheney Middle School (adjacent to the site of the junior high school constructed in 1977, at 2716 N. 6th) and Westwood Middle School (at the site of Windsor Elementary in unincorporated Spokane County, near Spokane International Airport). The exterior of Cheney Middle School was painted blue, and Westwood was painted red. Each building is and had nearly identical costs of $24 million (Cheney) and $26 million (Westwood), with the extra cost for Westwood required for site preparation. The buildings were designed by NAC Architecture.\n\nGround was broken for a new elementary school in 2012. Cheney School District opened its eighth school building, Snowdon Elementary, for the 2014–15 academic year. Snowdon was named in honor of the late Phil Snowdon, who had served as superintendent of Cheney School District.

{"id": "2200226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200226", "title": "The Miser and his Gold", "text": "The Miser and his Gold\n\nThe Miser and his Gold (or Treasure) is one of Aesop's Fables that deals directly with human weaknesses, in this case the wrong use of possessions. Since this is a story dealing only with humans, it allows the point to be made directly through the medium of speech rather than be surmised from the situation. It is numbered 225 in the Perry Index. \n\nThe basic story concerns a miser who reduced his riches to a lump of gold, which he buried. Coming back to view it every day, he was spied on and his treasure stolen. As the man bewailed his loss, he was consoled by a neighbour that he might as well bury a stone (or return to look at the hole) and it would serve the same purpose for all the good his money had done him or that he had done with his money. \n\nSince versions of the fable were confined to Greek, it only began to gain greater currency during the European Renaissance. Gabriele Faerno made it the subject of a Latin poem in his \"Centum Fabulae\" (1563). In England it was included in collections of Aesop's fables by Roger L'Estrange as \"A miser burying his gold\" and by Samuel Croxall as \"The covetous man\".\n\nAppreciating the cut and thrust of the argument, the composer Jerzy Sapieyevski included the fable as the fourth his \"Aesop Suite\" (1984), set for brass quintet and narrator, as an example of how ‘musical elements lurk in gifted oratorical arguments’.\n\nThe story was made the occasion for commenting on the proper use of riches by authors in both the East and the West. In Saadi Shirazi's \"Bostan\" (The Garden, 1257), the Persian poet retells it as “A miserly father and his prodigal son”. The son spies on his father to discover where he has hidden his wealth, digs it up and substitutes a stone. When the father finds that it has all been squandered, his son declares that spending is what money is for, otherwise it is as useless as a stone. \n\nIn La Fontaine's Fables, where the fable appears as \"L'avare qui a perdu son trésor\" (IV.20), the story is made the occasion for a meditation on the nature of ownership. It begins with the statement 'Possessions have no value till we use them' and uses the story as an illustration of someone who is owned by the gold rather than being its owner. In Germany, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing gave the ending an additional twist in his retelling. What drives the miser to distraction, in addition to his loss, is that someone else is the richer for it.\n\nMeanwhile, a parallel fable had entered European literature based upon a symmetrical two-line epigram in the Greek Anthology, once ascribed to Plato but more plausibly to Statillius Flaccus. A man, intending to hang himself, discovered hidden gold and left the rope behind him; the man who had hidden the gold, not finding it, hanged himself with the noose he found in its place. The 3rd century CE Latin poet Ausonius made a four-line version, the Tudor poet Thomas Wyatt extended this to eight lines and the Elizabethan George Turberville to twelve. Early in the 17th century, John Donne alluded to the story and reduced it to a couplet again:\n\nThe longest telling and interpretation of the episode was in the 76 lines of 's \"First Book of Emblems\" (1550) under the title \"Man proposes but God disposes\". In the following century, La Fontaine added this story too to his \"Fables\" as the lengthy “The treasure and the two men” (IX.15).\n\n"}

{"id": "2200232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200232", "title": "Cariboo Gold Rush", "text": "Cariboo Gold Rush\n\nThe Cariboo Gold Rush was a gold rush in the Colony of British Columbia, which earlier joined the Canadian province of British Columbia. The first gold discovery was made at Hills Bar in 1858, followed by more strikes in 1859 on the Horsefly River, and on Keithley Creek and Antler Creek in 1860. The actual rush did not begin until 1861, when these discoveries were widely publicized. By 1865, following the strikes along Williams Creek, the rush was in full swing.\n\nTowns grew up, the most famous of these being Barkerville, now preserved as a heritage site and tourist attraction. Other important towns of the Cariboo gold rush era were Keithley Creek, Quesnel Forks or simply \"the Forks\", Antler, Richfield, Quesnellemouthe (which would later be shortened to Quesnel), Horsefly and, around the site of the Hudson's Bay Company's fort of the same name, Alexandria.\n\nRichfield was the first strike on Williams Creek, and became the seat of government in the region, particularly of the courts. Connected to Barkerville via the canyon of Williams Creek, Richfield became part of \"Greater Barkerville\" along with Cameron Town.\n\nThe Cariboo Gold Rush is the most famous of the gold rushes in British Columbia, so much so that it is sometimes erroneously cited as the reason for the creation of the Colony of British Columbia. The Colony's creation had been prompted by an influx of American prospectors to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush three years earlier in 1858, which had its locus in the area from Lillooet to Yale.\n\nUnlike its southern counterpart, the population of the Cariboo Gold Rush was largely British and Canadian, among them 4000 were Chinese, although the first wave of the rush was largely American. By the time the Cariboo rush broke out there was more active interest in the Gold Colony (as British Columbia was often referred to) in the United Kingdom and Canada and there had also been time required for more British and Canadians to get there. The electorate of the Cariboo riding were among the most pro-Confederation in the colony, and this was in no small part because of the strong Canadian element in the local populace.\n\nOne reason the Cariboo rush attracted fewer Americans than the original Fraser rush may have been the American Civil War, with many who had been around after the Fraser Gold Rush going home to take sides, or to the Fort Colville Gold Rush which was largely manned by men who had been on the Fraser or to other BC rushes such as those at Rock Creek and Big Bend.\n\nWhile some of the population that came for the Cariboo rush stayed on as permanent settlers, taking up land in various parts of the Interior in the 1860s and after, that wasn't the general rule for those involved in the Fraser rush. Many veterans of the Cariboo would spread out to explore the rest of the province, in particular triggering the Omineca and Cassiar Gold Rushes, just as the Cariboo itself had been found by miners seeking out in search of new finds from the Fraser rush.\n\nThe boom in the Cariboo goldfields was the impetus for the construction of the Cariboo Wagon Road by the Royal Engineers, which bypassed the older routes via the Fraser Canyon and the Lakes Route (Douglas Road) via Lillooet by using the canyon of the Thompson River to Ashcroft and from there via the valley of the Bonaparte River to join the older route from Lillooet at Clinton.\n\nTowns along the Cariboo Road include Clinton, 100 Mile House and Williams Lake, although most had their beginnings before the Cariboo rush began. During the rush, the largest and most important town lay at the road's end at Barkerville, which had grown up around the most profitable and famous of the many Cariboo mining camps. \nThe Cariboo Wagon Road was an immense infrastructure burden for the colony but needed to be built to enable access and bring governmental authority to the Cariboo goldfields, which was necessary in order to maintain and assert control of the wealth, which might more easily have passed through the Interior to the United States. \nThe wagon road's most important freight was the Gold Escort, which brought government bullion to Yale for shipment to the colonial treasury. Despite the wealth of the Cariboo goldfields, the expense of colonizing the Cariboo contributed to the Mainland Colony's virtual bankruptcy and its forced union with the Island Colony, and similarly into Confederation.\n\nA 1976 young adult novel, Cariboo Runaway, by Sandy Frances Duncan, is set in the Cariboo area during the Cariboo Gold Rush.\n\n\n"}

Hormuzd Rassam (1826–1910) still applied the term \"Chaldeans\" no less to those not in communion with Rome than to the Catholic Chaldeans and stated that \"the present Chaldeans, with a few exceptions, speak the same dialect used in the Targum, and in some parts of Ezra and Daniel, which are called 'Chaldee'.\"\n\nIn 1553, Mar Yohannan Sulaqa, willing to separate from the Church of the East's Patriarchal See of Alqosh, an Assyrian town in the Assyrian homeland, went to Rome asking for his appointment as Patriarch. He was consecrated in St. Peter's Basilica on 9 April 1553.\n\n\nThe Catholic Patriarchs based in Amid, now Diyarbakır in southeastern Turkey, began with Joseph I who in 1667 became Catholic, obtained civil recognition of his independence from the patriarchal see of Alqosh in 1677, and in 1681 was recognized by Rome as \"patriarch of the Chaldean nation deprived of its patriarch\".\n\n\nFrom 1830, the post of Catholic patriarch continued under Yohannan VIII Hormizd as Patriarch of Babylon and head of what is now called the Chaldean Catholic Church.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Alqosh was the seat of what, until the setting up of the Shimun line, had been the only patriarchal line, tracing its origins from the Apostle Thomas in the 1st century. This line is called the Eliyya line, because of the name that each of its successive patriarchs assumed. In 1771, the Alqosh Patriarch Eliyya XII Denkha (1722–1778) entered communion with the Catholic Church. However, on his death in 1778, his successor Eliyya XIII Ishoʿyahb, after obtaining recognition by Rome, quickly repudiated the union and returned to the traditional doctrine. His cousin Yohannan VIII Hormizd professed the Catholic faith and won others to the same faith. When Eliyya IX Ishoʿyahb died in 1804, no successor was elected and Yohannan Hormizd remained the only representative of the line. Rome recognized him in 1783 as metropolitan bishop of Mosul and administrator of the Alqosh/Mosul patriarchate. Only in 1830, after the death in 1827 of Augustine Hindi, the representative of the Josephite line, who had also been under consideration for recognition as the Catholic patriarch, was he acknowledged by Rome as patriarch.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His mother's love for music encouraged his pursuit of a performing career. At age 13 he performed at the New Jersey Pavilion at the World's Fair in Flushing, New York with his first band, The Auroras. By age 14, he was playing regularly in local clubs in the New York area, and spending his summers playing at Catskill Mountains resort hotels.\n\nAt age 18, while a student at Brooklyn College, Gross became a founding member of 1950's Rock & Roll revival group, Sha Na Na, playing guitar and wearing the greaser clothes he wore while a student at Midwood High School.\n\nGross left Sha Na Na to become a solo singer-songwriter in 1970. He signed a recording contract with ABC Dunhill Records in 1971. While there, he did some session work for producers Tommy West and Terry Cashman. He played electric lead guitar on the Jim Croce album, \"I Got a Name\". His own debut album had little commercial success. He continued to play at clubs and colleges until 1973, when he signed with A&M Records.\n\nHis first self-titled A&M album sold well. It included several regional hits including \"Simone\", \"Come On Say It\", \"Skin King\", and a cover version of Lindisfarne's European hit, \"Meet Me on the Corner\". With Gross' second A&M album, \"Plug Me Into Something\", he began to achieve national recognition in \"Rolling Stone\" and \"The New York Times\".\n\nGross moved on to Lifesong Records to make his next album. He produced a single, \"Shannon\", a song written about the death of former Beach Boys member Carl Wilson's dog, who was named Shannon. The single went gold in the U.S. and became a worldwide hit, reaching #6 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and #5 on the \"Cash Box\" Top 100 in 1976. In Canada it reached #1 in May of the same year. \"Shannon\" also reached #1 in New Zealand, but peaked only at #32 in the UK. After this single's success, Gross released the album, \"Release\". His second single, \"Springtime Mama\", reached #37 in the US, selling nearly a million copies.\n\nOn his next album, \"Show Me to the Stage\", Gross mixed rock and roll songs with Phil Spector and Brian Wilson influences. While the album sold well, it provided no hit singles. He also recorded The Beatles song \"Help!\" for the documentary, \"All This and World War II\"; both occurred in 1976. Gross' recording career slowed, but with CBS Records he made \"Love Is the Stuff\" and with Capitol Records, in 1981, along with Bobby Colomby, produced the \"What's in a Name\" album.\n\nAs a session guitarist Henry performed on many records by other artists including Jim Croce (I Got A Name, ABC Records 1973)\nJudy Collins (Home Again, Elektra/ Asylum 1984), and Andy Kim (Baby, I Love You, Steed/Dot Records 1970).\n\nHis songs have been recorded by a variety of artists including Judy Collins, Mary Travers, Cyndi Lauper, Jonathan Edwards, Henry Paul, Blackhawk, Southside Johnny, Garry Tallent and Rob Stoner. \n\nIn the 1980s, Gross performed in the road company production of \"Pump Boys and Dinettes\" with a cast featuring Jonathan Edwards (Sunshine) and Nicolette Larson (Lotta Love). Gross moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1986 and signed a publishing deal with Pic-A-Lic Music, a company owned by songwriters Roger Cook and Ralph Murphy.\n\nGross continued his songwriting and recording career in Nashville. In 1993, he released the album \"Nothing But Dreams\" on his own record label, Zelda Records, named after his mother. He had a Top 40 Country Radio hit, \"Big Guitar\" for the Arista recording group Blackhawk, fronted by his good friend, Henry Paul. Gross released \"I'm Hearing Things\" on Zelda Records in 2001. \n\nHe has also written and currently performs a one-man show called \"One Hit Wanderer\", chronicling the highlights and funniest moments of his life in and out of the entertainment business.\n\nHe continues to record in Fort Myers, Florida with multi-instrumentalist and recording engineer John McLane, having produced four albums with 74 tracks: \"One Hit Wanderer\" (2006), \"Foreverland\" (2007), \"Rhymes and Misdemeanors\" and \"Right as Rain\" (2011). A single was released, \"What a Christmas\", the same year. As a further accomplishment, he released a trio album in 2011 with Jonathan Edwards and Henry Paul, titled \"Edwards, Gross & Paul\" AKA \"The Vereens\".\n\nIn 2016 Henry traveled to the UK to support long time friend Joe Brown on his Just Joe UK tour. Joe and Henry played a selection of hits from Joe and Henry’s discography as well as a selection of rock and roll and country hits. The tour was a resounding success with the vast majority of the shows selling out. \n\nIn early 2017 before leaving for the UK, Henry, on his Zelda Records label, released three new CD's, \"Mixed Messages\", \"Stories I've Lived To Tell\" and \"New Orleans, New Orleans- a collection of songs from a new musical comedy play of the same name, written by Henry and playwright Ed Greenberg. \n\nIn October of 2017, the pair went back on the road with the same show, this time backed up by the live album, produced by Henry, recorded during the 2016 tour.

The remaining population was spread throughout the rural areas within the municipality's borders. Some other notable localities within these borders include Ojo de Agua, Azqueltán, Santa Rita, Las Adjuntas, Izolta, La Cienega de Marquez, Uribes and Patagua.\n\nThe municipality has suffered decreasing population in recent decades, largely due to emigration. In 2000, 31% of the working population was employed in agriculture and husbandry, 14% in construction, 13% in commerce and 13% in manufacturing.\n\nPrior to the Spanish conquest, the municipality of Villa Guerrero was inhabited by the indigenous Tepecan (Tepehuan). The area was conquered by the Spanish Captain Pedro Almíndez Chirino, sent by Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán in the year 1530. Shortly after the arrival of the Spanish into the area, the Huichol (Wixarika) migrated to the area's remote canyons and mountains. The Spanish settlement of the area at the end of the 16th century brought a number of Tlaxcaltec colonizers to the area.\n\nIn its origins it was named \"Xonacatic\", which means \"place of onions\", but not of the edible onion, but of those commonly known as \"chives\", which are born alone in times of water and in muddy places.\n\nThe oldest Spanish land grant in the area was in 1579 to Luis de los Rios Proaño. The grant was for approximately 120 km² in the valley of Juanacatic (from the indigenous name for the valley: Xoncacatic, meaning place of the onions). Missions were founded by the Franciscans in the area in the latter years of the 16th century. In the early 17th century, the area was the scene of a number of indigenous uprisings, including one by the Wixarika and Tepecan in 1607, resulting in its abandonment by the few Spanish settlers. In 1622, the descendants of the original grantee took interest once again in the land, seeking out titles in Zacatecas. The land was eventually sold to Captain Juan de Escobedo and Captain Juan Diaz de Infante. Around 1673, European settlement in the region was still limited, with only one agricultural hacienda in the region known as Juanacatic. By 1673, the place was an agricultural and cattle ranch called Juanacatic, owned by the Spanish captain Juan de Escobedo.\n\nIn 1676, the Spanish military administrator for the region of Colotlán Toribio González de Escalante, began the extraction of saltpeter in the valley. From this activity, the place gained the name of El Salitre. Eventually the extraction of saltpeter ceased due to its cost inefficiency and the administrator's inability to retain sufficient labor.\n\nIn 1702, the Tepehuan and Wixarika from the nearby mountains and canyons joined forces in a rebellion. The result was an adjudication by the Spanish Crown that forced the major Spanish landowner, Ana de Santiago, widow of Juan Diaz de Infante, to trade some of her agricultural land in the plateau for land in the canyon. Thus the Tepehuan regained part of their historic lands in a location known as Patahua. The Tepehuan community received an official grant for the land in 1733.\n\nIn 1779, the Juanacatic hacienda was acquired by Pedro de Llanos y Valdés as the area began to experience large flows of European immigration. Agricultural activity and husbandry benefited from the mining activities in nearby Bolaños, which had begun large scale production in the 1730s. El Salitre became a regular stopover of the mule trains that transported the ore out of the canyon.\n\nThere were several battles in 1810 during the war for independence fought in the region. Many of the local indigenous groups, including the Wixarika fought on the side of the Spanish Crown.\n\nPolitical reforms, such as the Iguala Plan undertaken in 1821 by the newly independent government extinguished separate treatment of indigenous communities and communal lands of the Tepehuan were distributed to individuals. In 1838, the area was made part of the 8th Canton of the free and sovereign state of Jalisco, within the Mexican Republic and was assigned to the municipality of Totatiche within that canton.\n\nConstruction on a stone church to replace the adobe chapel of the town of El Salitre began in 1905. The work was completed nearly two decades later, following the Mexican Revolution. Soon thereafter, in 1921, the municipality was separated from the municipality of Totatiche and declared an independent municipality by the state legislature and renamed Villa Guerrero in honor of Vicente Guerrero.\n\nThe most common type of terrain in the municipality is mountainous (46%) followed by plains (34%) and rolling hills (20%). The altitudes in the municipality vary greatly, ranging from 900 to 2,100 meters (2,950–6,900) above sea level. Their highest elevations are: in the north, Mount of the Cross (Cerro de la Cruz), to the west, White Deer Mountain (Cerro del Venado Blanco), the Toril Mesa and the Chihuahua Mesa; to the south and southeast, Pine Mountain (Cerro del Pino) and Thistles Mountain (Cerro de los Cardos).\n\nThe municipality's hydrologic resources are provided mainly by the Bolaños River. Other larger streams with permanent flow include: Sataray River, Blue Puddle (Charco Azul) River and La Villa River. There are also streams with seasonal flow, including: Chihuahua Creek, Nogales Creek, Zacatequillas Creek, New Water (Agua Nueva) Creek, Rinconada Creek, La Labor Creek, Las Planillas Creek and Juanacatic Creek\n\nThe municipality's climate is semiarid, with dry winters and springs, and a temperate and dry winter without a well defined spring season.

In the lower altitudes, oak and live oak trees dominate. In the hills and lower altitudes there are cacti, acacia, Arizona kidneywood and other plant species. The foothills and the plains are covered by natural grasses.

After working with Antonioni, Vitti changed focus and began making comedies, working with director Mario Monicelli on many films. She has appeared with Marcello Mastroianni, Richard Harris, Terence Stamp, Michael Caine, and Dirk Bogarde. Vitti won five David di Donatello Awards for Best Actress, seven Italian Golden Globes for Best Actress, the Career Golden Globe, and the Venice Film Festival Career Golden Lion Award.\n\nBorn Maria Luisa Ceciarelli in Rome, she acted in amateur productions as a teenager, then trained as an actress at Rome's National Academy of Dramatic Arts (graduating in 1953) and at Pittman's College, where she played a teen in a charity performance of Dario Niccodemi's \"La nemica\". She toured Germany with an Italian acting troupe and her first stage appearance in Rome was for a production of Niccolò Machiavelli's \"La Mandragola\".\n\nVitti's first film role was an uncredited bit part in Edoardo Anton's \"Ridere Ridere Ridere\" (1954). She was in \"Adriana Lecouvreur\" (1955), the TV series \"L'alfiere\" (1956) and the TV movies \"Questi ragazzi\" (1956) and \"Il tunnel\" (1958). She did an episode of \"Mont-Oriol\" (1958) and dubbed Rosaana Rory's voice in \"Big Deal on Madonna Street\" (1958).\n\nVitti's first widely noted performance was at the age of 26, in Mario Amendola's \"Le dritte\" (1958) with Franco Fabrizi. She was in the TV movie \"Il borghese gentiluomo\" (1959).\n\nIn 1957 she joined Michelangelo Antonioni's \"Teatro Nuovo di Milano\" and dubbed the voice of Dorian Gray in the director's \"Il Grido\" (\"The Cry\", 1957). She played a leading role in Antonioni's internationally praised film \"L'avventura\" (1960), as a detached and cool protagonist drifting into a relationship with the lover of her missing girlfriend. Giving a screen presence which has been described as \"stunning\", she is also credited with helping Antonioni raise money for the production and sticking with him through daunting location shooting. \"L'avventura\" made Vitti an international star. Her image later appeared on an Italian postage stamp commemorating the film. According to \"The New York Times\", Vitti's \"air of disenchantment perfectly conveys the unreal aura of her heroines.\"\nVitti received critical praise for starring roles in the Antonioni film \"La Notte\" (\"Night\", 1961), with Jeanne Moreau and Marcello Mastroianni. Vitti starred in a TV movie \"Le notti bianche\" (1962) then did a third with Antonioni, \"L'Eclisse\" (1962) with Alain Delon.\n\nVitti was one of many stars in an anthology movie, \"Three Fables of Love\" (1962). She had a cameo in \"Sweet and Sour\" (1963) and played the lead in a comedy for Roger Vadim, \"Nutty, Naughty Chateau\" (1963). Vitti was then in another anthology film \"High Infidelity\" (1964) and made a fourth with Antonioni, \"Il Deserto Rosso\" (\"Red Desert\", 1964), with Richard Harris. The director said Vitti \"certainly inspires me, because I like to watch and direct her, but the parts I give her are a long way from her own character.\"\n\nAfter Vitti's relationship with Antonioni ended, the two did not work together again until \"Il mistero di Oberwald\" (1980).\n\nVitti starred in a comedy for Tinto Brass, \"The Flying Saucer\" (1964), and appeared in the anthology, \"The Dolls\" (1964).\n\nVitti's first English language film was \"Modesty Blaise\" (1966), a mod James Bond spy spoof in which she performed in July 1965. Co starring Terence Stamp and Dirk Bogarde, directed by Joseph Losey, it had only mixed success and received harsh critical reviews.\n\nShe performed in the anthology movie \"The Queens\" (1966), a television series \"Les fables de La Fontaine\" (1966), \"Kill Me Quick, I'm Cold\" (1967) with Jean Sorel, and \"I Married You for Fun\" (1967).\n\nVitti appeared in \"On My Way to the Crusades, I Met a Girl Who...\" (1967) with Tony Curtis, \"The Girl with a Pistol\" (1968) with Stanley Baker, \"The Bitch Wants Blood\" (1969) with Maurice Ronet, and \"Help Me, My Love\" (1969) with Alberto Sordi.\n\nVitti starred with Marcello Mastroianni in Ettore Scola's highly successful romantic comedy \"Dramma della gelosia\" (\"The Pizza Triangle\", 1970). She followed it with \"Ninì Tirabusciò, la donna che inventò la mossa\" (1970), \"Le coppie\" (1970) with Sordi, \"The Pacifist\" (1970), \"La supertestimone\" (1971), \"That's How We Women Are\" (1971), and \"Orders Are Orders\" (1972).\n\nVitti was in a version of \"La Tosca\" (1973) and a comedy \"Teresa the Thief\" (1973). She made \"Polvere di stelle\" (1973), directed by Alberto Sordi, for which she won the 1974 David di Donatello award for Best Actress.\n\nVitti played a key part in one of the episodic vignettes in Luis Buñuel's \"The Phantom of Liberty\" (1974). She did two films with Claudia Cardinale, \"The Immortal Bachelor\" (1975) and \"Blonde in Black Leather\" (1975).\n\nShe was in \"Duck in Orange Sauce\" (1975), \"Mimì Bluette... fiore del mio giardino\" (1976), \"Basta che non si sappia in giro!..\" (1977), \"L'altra metà del cielo\" (1977), \"State Reasons\" (1978), \"Il cilindro\" (1978), \"Per vivere meglio, divertitevi con noi\" (1978), \"Amori miei\" (1978) and \"Tigers in Lipstick\" (1979) (with Ursula Andress).\n\nVitti's second English film was \"An Almost Perfect Affair\" (1979), directed by Michael Ritchie and co-starring Keith Carradine, which was set during the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nVitti reunited with Antonioni in \"The Mystery of Oberwald\" (1980) which is not as well known as \"L'Avventura\". She followed it in \"I Don't Understand You Anymore\" (1980), \"Camera d'albergo\" (1981), \"Tango of Jealousy\" (1981), \"I Know That You Know That I Know\" (1982) with Sordi, \"Scusa se è poco\" (1982), \"Flirt\" (1983), and \"Francesca è mia\" (1986). She co wrote the last two films. In 1984 she was awarded the Order of Arts and Letters by French Culture Minister Jack Lang, who praised her for helping spur a renewal of Italian films. \"We need Italian cinema to find its health again so that French cinema will not remain an island in the middle of other European countries,\" Lang said. By 1986, Vitti had returned to the theatre as an actress and teacher.\n\nIn 1989, Vitti tried writing and directing, and created \"Scandalo Segreto\" (1990), which she also starred in alongside Elliott Gould. The film was not a success and she then retired from cinema.\n\nDuring the 1990s she did television work, acting and directing, including \"Ma tu mi vuoi bene?\" (1992).\n\nIn 1993 Vitti was awarded the Festival Tribute at the Créteil International Women's Film Festival, in France.\n\nMichelangelo Antonioni and Vitti met in the late 1950s, and their relationship grew stronger after \"L'Avventura\" was made, because it had shaped both their careers. However, by the late 1960s, they did not make any movies together, making the relationship strained until it officially ended. In a later interview, Vitti stated that Antonioni ended their relationship. They made the film \"Il mistero di Oberwald\" together in 1981.\n\nIn 1995 Vitti married Roberto Russo, with whom she had lived since 1975. In 2011, it was learned that Alzheimer's disease had \"removed her from the public gaze for the last 15 years.\" In 2018, her husband confirmed she is still living in Rome and with a caretaker.\n\n\n\n"}

The team debuted in 1988 and disbanded in 2002.\n\nSting and Lex Luger first teamed up in April 1988 after Luger found himself without a tag team partner for the 1988 Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament in the wake of former partner Barry Windham turning on Luger and taking Luger's old spot in The Four Horsemen and Ron Garvin's injury at the hands of The Varsity Club. They won the tournament and would periodically team up in between their careers as singles competitors. Their team was seemingly defunct after Luger turned heel in June 1989, but Sting was also the cause of Luger's face turn in February 1990, as Luger replaced Sting as the #1 contender for Ric Flair's NWA World Title while Sting was out with a knee injury. While Luger failed to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, he would end up winning what would eventually become WCW's primary World Title, the WCW World Title on two occasions.\n\nThey teamed up again as part of the Dudes With Attitudes in World Championship Wrestling to battle The Four Horsemen in 1990. They did not form a regular team again at this point, although they would pair up occasionally, most notably to challenge The Steiner Brothers for the WCW World Tag Team Championship at SuperBrawl I. The two would feud again in 1991 when Flair left WCW for the World Wrestling Federation and Luger turned heel while winning the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Luger at SuperBrawl II on February 29, 1992. Luger left WCW after losing the title.\n\nThe next time they teamed was in September 1995 in WCW when Luger made a return to WCW on the first \"Monday Nitro\". Sting was helping Hulk Hogan and \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage in their feud with The Four Horsemen and The Dungeon of Doom and Luger joined up. Luger bickered with Savage and Hogan, and Sting always had to keep the peace. At WCW Halloween Havoc 1995 on October 29, Luger joined Jimmy Hart and turned heel when he attacked Hogan. He continued his team with Sting and they won the WCW World Tag Team Championship on January 22, 1996 on Nitro when they defeated Harlem Heat. During their reign, Luger was a heel and Sting was a face. During their reign, they feuded with Harlem Heat and the returning Road Warriors. They finally lost the titles on June 24, 1996 to Harlem Heat when The Outsiders caused a distraction at ringside, during a match, which also included The Steiner Brothers.\n\nTheir team ended in September 1996 when Luger believed that Sting joined the New World Order (nWo). In reality, it was The nWo Sting, and Sting soon turned his back on Luger. They eventually made peace when Sting saved Luger from a gang attack by the nWo. They both joined the nWo rebel faction \"Wolfpac\" in May 1998 when the nWo split and teamed together occasionally. However, Sting disappeared from WCW in October due to a severe knee injury and the team was dissolved after the Wolfpac rejoined with the rest of the nWo in January 1999. Luger remained a part of the reunited faction while Sting returned to feud with nWo leader Hogan and others when he returned in March 1999.\n\nIn September 1999, Luger and Sting reunited when Luger helped Sting defeat Hogan at Fall Brawl, turning Sting heel in the process. However, the team was broken up after Starrcade in December 1999 and began a short feud which ended when Luger broke Sting's wrist by stomping on it while it was enclosed in a steel chair. The two later became allies again in the Millionaire's Club, but Luger was injured shortly thereafter and he and Sting went their separate ways.\n\nIn November 2002, Luger and Sting briefly teamed together in World Wrestling All-Stars until Luger turned on him starting another feud over the WWA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\n\n"}

In 1880, the western half of Kill Creek Township became Mount Ayr Township. The rural farming community of Kill Creek, situated in the northern part of the township, was for a time a busy stop on the Bull City-Russell Freight Trail. An analysis of census records has shown that it suffered a steady decline in population over the years. Today, it has largely disappeared aside from a small number of residents who live in farmhouses spread throughout the township. The general store and post office are remembered only via a 1949 memorial marker where they once stood. The Kill Creek Presbyterian Church, built in 1885, was long the symbol of the community.

Since he first appeared on the film scene in 1989, Schnaas has become a leader in Germany's ultra-violent low-budget horror film industry.\n\nAndreas Schnaas was born in Hamburg and embraced cinema at a very young age. Since many of the local theaters in his city did not care about how young their patrons were, he was exposed to violent martial arts, zombie films, and splatter very early on in his life. Schnaas' parents were not always pleased with his choice of entertainment, but recognized his artistic talents and vivid imagination. He used this imagination, compounded with his love of horror, to make his first film at age twelve. The film, entitled \"Hunted\", featured Andreas and his friend ruthlessly killing an elderly man, who was played by his grandfather. His father filmed this feature, as well as many other movies that the boys made over the next several years. It was not until 1989, however, that he mustered together five thousand marks - enough to make his first full-length feature.\n\nShot with his friends over four \"extremely long\" weekends, Schnaas' gory tale of \"Karl the Butcher\", entitled \"Violent Shit\", went on to become Germany's first direct-to-video horror film. An immediate success, the film quickly appeared on video stores in America and throughout the rest of Europe. When asked where he came up with such a vulgar title for his film, the director once explained that a pen pal in New Zealand once playfully told him, “All you’re making is violent shit,” and it stuck. That pen pal grew into producer Ant Timpson, the creator of the \"ABCs of Death\" films.\n\nStill spiraling off \"Violent Shit\"’s unexpected success, Andreas created his homage to the undead with \"Zombie 90 - Extreme Pestilence\" (1990), the English version of which is regarded by some genre fans to have the most hilarious dubbing ever put to celluloid. The following year, he decided to continue the story of Karl with \"\", eventually releasing it in 1992. Due to an intense fan interest through his official website, Andreas decided to continue the \"Violent Shit\" series - filming the third chapter of the trilogy the next year. Budget constraints kept the film from being released for years, but it eventually saw the light of day in 1999 under the title, \"Violent Shit III: Infantry of Doom\" (or \"Zombie Doom\" in the US). Andreas also played the killer, Karl, in all three films.\n\nHis following film was \"Der Kelch - Goblet of Gore\" of 1996, although various issues kept it shelved until 2005. As a homage to Italian director Joe D'Amato, he then remade the classic slasher film, \"Anthropophagous\", changing the title to \"Anthropophagous 2000\" (1999). It was also in 1999 that Andreas began preparing for his next film, which he would release as his “millennium shocker”. The movie, \"Demonium\" (2001), was his first 35MM project, made with completely professional actors and shot in English.\n\nIn 2003 Schnaas directed his first film in America, \"Nikos\", featuring Joe Zaso and Felissa Rose. After that, he created the zombie action film \"Don't Wake the Dead\" (2006) and, in 2009, directed two films with fellow German auteur Timo Rose - \"Unrated\" and \"Karl vs Axe\", the latter of which being the latest chapter in his \"Violent Shit\" series.\n\n"}

{"id": "2200368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200368", "title": "Geology of Venus", "text": "Geology of Venus\n\nVenus is a planet with striking geology. Of all the other planets in the Solar System, it is the one nearest to Earth and most like it in terms of mass, but has no magnetic field or recognizable plate tectonic system. Much of the ground surface is exposed volcanic bedrock, some with thin and patchy layers of soil covering, in marked contrast with Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Some impact craters are present, but Venus is similar to Earth in that there are many fewer craters than on the other rocky planets that are largely covered by them. \n\nThis is due in part to the thickness of the Venusian atmosphere disrupting small impactors before they strike the ground, but the paucity of large craters may be due to volcanic re-surfacing, possibly of a catastrophic nature. Volcanism appears to be the dominant agent of geological change on Venus. Some of the volcanic landforms appear to be unique to the planet. There are shield and composite volcanoes similar to those found on Earth. Given that Venus has approximately the same size, density, and composition as Earth, it is plausible that volcanism may be continuing on the planet today, as demonstrated by recent studies \n\nMost of the Venusian surface is relatively flat; it is divided into three topographic units: lowlands, highlands, and plains. In the early days of radar observation the highlands drew comparison to the continents of Earth, modern research has shown that this is superficial and the absence of plate tectonics makes this comparison misleading. Tectonic features are present to a limited extent, including linear \"deformation belts\" composed of folds and faults. These may be caused by mantle convection. Many of the tectonic features such as \"tesserae\" (large regions of highly deformed terrain, folded and fractured in two or three dimensions), and \"arachnoids\" (for those features resembling a spider's web) are associated with volcanism.\n\nEolian landforms are not widespread on the planet's surface, but there is considerable evidence the planet's atmosphere causes the chemical weathering of rock, especially at high elevations. The planet is remarkably dry, with only a chemical trace of water vapor (20 ppm) in the Venusian atmosphere. No landforms indicative of past water or ice are visible in radar images of the surface. The atmosphere shows isotopic evidence of having been stripped of volatile elements by offgassing and solar wind erosion over time, implying the possibility that Venus may have had liquid water at some point in the distant past; no direct evidence for this has been found. Much speculation about the geological history of Venus continues today.\n\nThe surface of Venus is not easily accessible because of the extremely thick atmosphere (some 90 times that of Earth's) and the surface temperature. Much of what is known about it stems from orbital radar observations, because the surface is permanently obscured in visible wavelengths by cloud cover. In addition, a number of landers have returned data from the surface, including images.\n\nThe surface of Venus is comparatively flat. When 93% of the topography was mapped by Pioneer Venus Orbiter, scientists found that the total distance from the lowest point to the highest point on the entire surface was about , about the same as the vertical distance between the Earth's ocean floor and the higher summits of the Himalayas. This similarity is to be expected as the maximum attainable elevation contrasts on a planet are largely dictated by the strength of the planet's gravity and the mechanical strength of its lithosphere, these are similar for Earth and Venus.\n\nAccording to data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter altimeters, nearly 51% of the surface is located within 500 meters (1640 feet) of the median radius of ; only 2% of the surface is located at elevations greater than from the median radius.\n\nThe altimetry experiment of Magellan confirmed the general character of the landscape. According to the Magellan data, 80% of the topography is within of the median radius. The most important elevations are in the mountain chains that surround Lakshmi Planum: Maxwell Montes (11 km, 6.8 mi), Akna Montes (7 km, 4.3 mi) and Freya Montes (7 km, 4.3 mi). Despite the relatively flat landscape of Venus, the altimetry data also found large inclined plains. Such is the case on the southwest side of Maxwell Montes, which in some parts seems to be inclined some 45°. Inclinations of 30° were registered in Danu Montes and Themis Regio.\n\nAbout 75% of the surface is composed of bare rock.\n\nBased on altimeter data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter probe, supported by Magellan data, the topography of the planet is divided into three provinces: lowlands, deposition plains, and highlands.\n\nThis unit covers about 10% of the planet's surface, with elevations greater than . The largest provinces of the highlands are Aphrodite Terra, Ishtar Terra, and Lada Terra, as well as the regions Beta Regio, Phoebe Regio and Themis Regio. The regions Alpha Regio, Bell Regio, Eistla Regio and Tholus Regio are smaller regions of highlands.\n\nSome of the terrain in these areas is particularly efficient at reflecting radar signals. This is possibly analogous to snow lines on Earth and is likely related to temperatures and pressures there being lower than in the other provinces due to the higher elevation, which allows for distinct mineralogy to occur. It is thought that high-elevation rock formations may contain or be coated by minerals that have high dielectric constants. The high dielectric minerals would be stable at the ambient temperatures in the highlands, but not on the plains that comprise the rest of the planet's surface. Pyrite, an iron sulfide, matches these criteria and is widely suspected as a possible cause; it would be produced by chemical weathering of the volcanic highlands after long-term exposure to the sulfur-bearing Venusian atmosphere. The presence of pyrite on Venus has been contested, with atmospheric modeling showing that it might not be stable under Venusian atmospheric conditions. Other hypotheses have been put forward to explain the higher radar reflectivity in the highlands, including the presence of a ferroelectric material whose dielectric constant changes with temperature (with Venus having a changing temperature gradient with elevation). It has been observed that the character of the radar-bright highlands is not consistent across the surface of Venus. For example, Maxwell Montes shows the sharp, snow line-like change in reflectivity that is consistent with a change in mineralogy, whereas Ovda Regio shows a more gradual brightening upwards trend. The brightening upwards trend on Ovda Regio is consistent with a ferroelectric signature, and has been suggested to indicate the presence of chlorapatite.\n\nDeposition plains have elevations averaging 0 to 2 km and cover more than half of the planet's surface.\n\nThe rest of the surface is \"lowlands\" and generally lies below zero elevation. Radar reflectivity data suggest that at a centimeter scale these areas are smooth, as a result of \"gradation\" (accumulation of fine material eroded from the highlands).\n\nTen spacecraft have successfully landed on Venus and returned data, all were flown by the Soviet Union. Venera 9, 10, 13, and 14 had cameras and returned images of soil and rock. Spectrophotometry results showed that these four missions kicked up dust clouds on landing, which means that some of the dust particles must be smaller than about 0.02 mm. The rocks at all four sites showed fine layers, some layers were more reflective than others. Experiments on rocks at the Venera 13 and 14 sites found that they were porous and easily crushed (bearing maximum loads of 0.3 to 1 MPa) these rocks may be weakly lithified sediments or volcanic tuff. Spectrometry found that the surface materials at the Venera 9, 10, 14 and Vega 1 and 2 landing had chemical compositions similar to tholeiitic basalts, while the Venera 8 and 13 sites chemically resembled alkaline basalts.\n\nEarth-based radar surveys made it possible to identify some topographic patterns related to craters, and the \"Venera 15\" and \"Venera 16\" probes identified almost 150 such features of probable impact origin. Global coverage from \"Magellan\" subsequently made it possible to identify nearly 900 impact craters. \n\nCompared to Mercury, the Moon and other such bodies, Venus has very few craters. In part, this is because Venus's dense atmosphere burns up smaller meteorites before they hit the surface. The \"Venera\" and \"Magellan\" data are in agreement: there are very few impact craters with a diameter less than , and data from \"Magellan\" show an absence of any craters less than in diameter. The small craters are irregular and appear in groups, thus pointing to the deceleration and the breakup of impactors. However, there are also fewer of the large craters, and those appear relatively young; they are rarely filled with lava, showing that they were formed after volcanic activity in the area ceased, and radar data indicates that they are rough and have not had time to be eroded down.\n\nCompared to the situation on bodies such as the Moon, it is more difficult to determine the ages of different areas of the surface on Venus, on the basis of crater counts, due to the small number of craters at hand. However, the surface characteristics are consistent with a completely random distribution, implying that the surface of the entire planet is roughly the same age, or at least that very large areas are not very different in age from the average.\n\nTaken together, this evidence suggests that the surface of Venus is geologically young. The impact crater distribution appears to be most consistent with models that call for a near-complete resurfacing of the planet. Subsequent to this period of extreme activity, process rates declined and impact craters began to accumulate, with only minor modification and resurfacing since.\n\nA young surface all created at the same time is a different situation compared with any of the other terrestrial planets.\n\nAge estimates based on crater counts indicate a young surface, in contrast to the much older surfaces of Mars, Mercury, and the Moon. For this to be the case on a planet without crustal recycling by plate tectonics requires explanation. One hypothesis is that Venus underwent some sort of global resurfacing about 300–500 million years ago that erased the evidence of older craters.\n\nOne possible explanation for this event is that it is part of a cyclic process on Venus. On Earth, plate tectonics allows heat to escape from the mantle by advection, the transport of mantle material to the surface and the return of old crust to the mantle. But Venus has no evidence of plate tectonics, so this theory states that the interior of the planet heats up (due to the decay of radioactive elements) until material in the mantle is hot enough to force its way to the surface. The subsequent resurfacing event covers most or all of the planet with lava, until the mantle is cool enough for the process to start over.\n\nThe surface of Venus is dominated by volcanism. Although Venus is superficially similar to Earth, it seems that the tectonic plates so active in Earth's geology do not exist on Venus. About 80% of the planet consists of a mosaic of volcanic lava plains, dotted with more than a hundred large isolated shield volcanoes, and many hundreds of smaller volcanoes and volcanic constructs such as \"coronae\". These are geological features believed to be almost unique to Venus: huge, ring-shaped structures 100–300 kilometers (60–180 mi) across and rising hundreds of meters above the surface. The only other place they have been discovered is on Uranus's moon Miranda. It is believed that they are formed when plumes of rising hot material in the mantle push the crust upwards into a dome shape, which then collapses in the centre as the molten lava cools and leaks out at the sides, leaving a crown-like structure: the corona.\n\nDifferences can be seen in volcanic deposits. In many cases, volcanic activity is localized to a fixed source, and deposits are found in the vicinity of this source. This kind of volcanism is called \"centralized volcanism,\" in that volcanoes and other geographic features form distinct regions. The second type of volcanic activity is not radial or centralized; flood basalts cover wide expanses of the surface, similar to features such as the Deccan Traps on Earth. These eruptions result in \"flow type\" volcanoes.\n\nVolcanoes less than in diameter are very abundant on Venus and they may number hundreds of thousands or even millions. Many appear as flattened domes or 'pancakes', thought to be formed in a similar way to shield volcanoes on Earth. These pancake dome volcanoes are fairly round features that are less than in height and many times that in width. It is common to find groups of hundreds of these volcanoes in areas called shield fields. The domes of Venus are between 10 and 100 times larger than those formed on Earth. They are usually associated with \"coronae\" and \"tesserae\". The pancakes are thought to be formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under Venus's high atmospheric pressure. Domes called scalloped margin domes (commonly called \"ticks\" because they appear as domes with numerous \"legs\"), are thought to have undergone mass wasting events such as landslides on their margins. Sometimes deposits of debris can be seen scattered around them.\n\nOn Venus, volcanoes are mainly of the shield type. Nevertheless, the morphology of the shield volcanoes of Venus is different from shield volcanoes on Earth. On the Earth, shield volcanoes can be a few tens of kilometers wide and up to 10 kilometers high (6.2 mi) in the case of Mauna Kea, measured from the sea floor. On Venus, these volcanoes can cover hundreds of kilometers in area, but they are relatively flat, with an average height of .\n\nOther unique features of Venus's surface are \"novae\" (radial networks of dikes or grabens) and arachnoids. A nova is formed when large quantities of magma are extruded onto the surface to form radiating ridges and trenches which are highly reflective to radar. These dikes form a symmetrical network around the central point where the lava emerged, where there may also be a depression caused by the collapse of the magma chamber.\n\nArachnoids are so named because they resemble a spider's web, featuring several concentric ovals surrounded by a complex network of radial fractures similar to those of a nova. It is not known whether the 250 or so features identified as arachnoids actually share a common origin, or are the result of different geological processes.\n\nDespite the fact that Venus appears to have no global plate tectonic system as such, the planet's surface shows various features associated with local tectonic activity. Features such as faults, folds, and volcanoes are present there and may be driven largely by processes in the mantle.\n\nThe active volcanism of Venus has generated chains of folded mountains, rift valleys, and terrain known as \"tesserae\", a word meaning \"floor tiles\" in Greek. Tesserae exhibit the effects of eons of compression and tensional deformation.\n\nUnlike those on Earth, the deformations on Venus are directly related to regional dynamic forces within the planet's mantle. Gravitational studies suggest that Venus differs from Earth in lacking an asthenosphere—a layer of lower viscosity and mechanical weakness that allows Earth's crustal tectonic plates to move. The apparent absence of this layer on Venus suggests that the deformation of the Venusian surface must be explained by convective movements within the planet's mantle.\n\nThe tectonic deformations on Venus occur on a variety of scales, the smallest of which are related to linear fractures or faults. In many areas these faults appear as networks of parallel lines. Small, discontinuous mountain crests are found which resemble those on the Moon and Mars. The effects of extensive tectonism are shown by the presence of \"normal faults\", where the crust has sunk in one area relative to the surrounding rock, and superficial fractures. Radar imaging shows that these types of deformation are concentrated in belts located in the equatorial zones and at high southern latitudes. These belts are hundreds of kilometers wide and appear to interconnect across the whole of the planet, forming a global network associated with the distribution of volcanoes.\n\nThe rifts of Venus, formed by the expansion of the lithosphere, are groups of depressions tens to hundreds of meters wide and extending up to in length. The rifts are mostly associated with large volcanic elevations in the form of domes, such as those at Beta Regio, Atla Regio and the western part of Eistla Regio. These highlands seem to be the result of enormous mantle plumes (rising currents of magma) which have caused elevation, fracturing, faulting, and volcanism.\n\nThe highest mountain chain on Venus, Maxwell Montes in Ishtar Terra, was formed by processes of compression, expansion, and lateral movement. Another type of geographical feature, found in the lowlands, consists of \"ridge belts\" elevated several meters above the surface, hundreds of kilometers wide and thousands of kilometers long. Two major concentrations of these belts exist: one in Lavinia Planitia near the southern pole, and the second adjacent to Atalanta Planitia near the northern pole.\n\nTesserae are found mainly in Aphrodite Terra, Alpha Regio, Tellus Regio and the eastern part of Ishtar Terra (Fortuna Tessera). These regions contain the superimposition and intersection of grabens of different geological units, indicating that these are the oldest parts of the planet. It was once thought that the tesserae were continents associated with tectonic plates like those of the Earth; in reality they are probably the result of floods of basaltic lava forming large plains, which were then subjected to intense tectonic fracturing.\n\nVenus's crust appears to be thick, and composed of silicate rocks. Venus's mantle is approximately thick, its chemical composition is probably similar to that of chondrites. Since Venus is a terrestrial planet, it is presumed to have a core made of semisolid iron and nickel with a radius of approximately .\n\nThe unavailability of seismic data from Venus severely limits what can be definitely known about the structure of the planet's mantle, but models of Earth's mantle have been modified to make predictions. It's expected that the uppermost mantle, from about to deep is mostly made of the mineral olivine. Descending through the mantle, the chemical composition remains largely the same but at somewhere between about and , the increasing pressure causes the crystal structure of olivine to change to the more densely packed structure of spinel. Another transition occurs between and deep, where the material takes on the progressively more compact crystal structures of ilmenite and perovskite, and gradually becomes more like perovskite until the core boundary is reached.\n\nVenus is similar to Earth in size and density, and so probably also in bulk composition, but it does not have a significant magnetic field. Earth's magnetic field is produced by what is known as the core dynamo, consisting of an electrically conducting liquid, the nickel-iron outer core that rotates and is convecting. Venus is expected to have an electrically conductive core of similar composition, and although its rotation period is very long (243.7 Earth days), simulations show that this is adequate to produce a dynamo. This implies that Venus lacks convection in its outer core. Convection occurs when there is a large difference in temperature between the inner and outer part of the core, but since Venus has no plate tectonics to let off heat from the mantle, it is possible that outer core convection is being suppressed by a warm mantle. It's also possible that Venus may lack a solid inner core for the same reason, if the core is either too hot or is not under enough pressure to allow molten nickel-iron to freeze there.\n\nLava flows on Venus are often much larger than Earth's, up to several hundred kilometers long and tens of kilometers wide. It is still unknown why these lava fields or \"lobate flows\" reach such sizes, but it is suggested that they are the result of very large eruptions of basaltic, low-viscosity lava spreading out to form wide, flat plains.\n\nOn Earth, there are two known types of basaltic lava: aa and pāhoehoe. Aa lava presents a rough texture in the shape of broken blocks (clinkers). Pāhoehoe lava is recognized by its pillowy or ropy appearance. Rough surfaces appear bright in radar images, which can be used to determine the differences between aa and pāhoehoe lavas. These variations can also reflect differences in lava age and preservation. Channels and lava tubes (channels that have cooled down and over which a dome has formed) are very common on Venus. Two planetary astronomers from the University of Wollongong in Australia, Dr Graeme Melville and Prof. Bill Zealey, researched these lava tubes, using data supplied by NASA, over a number of years and concluded that they were widespread and up to ten times the size of those on the Earth. Melville and Zealey said that the gigantic size of the Venusian lava tubes (tens of meters wide and hundreds of kilometers long) may be explained by the very fluid lava flows together with the high temperatures on Venus, allowing the lava to cool slowly.\n\nFor the most part, lava flow fields are associated with volcanoes. The central volcanoes are surrounded by extensive flows that form the core of the volcano. They are also related to fissure craters, coronae, dense clusters of volcanic domes, cones, wells and channels.\n\nThanks to \"Magellan\", more than 200 channels and valley complexes have been identified. The channels were classified as simple, complex, or compound. Simple channels are characterized by a single, long main channel. This category includes rills similar to those found on the Moon, and a new type, called \"canali\", consisting of long, distinct channels which maintain their width throughout their entire course. The longest such channel identified (Baltis Vallis) has a length of more than , about one-sixth of the circumference of the planet.\n\nComplex channels include anastomosed networks, in addition to distribution networks. This type of channel has been observed in association with several impact craters and important lava floods related to major lava flow fields. Compound channels are made of both simple and complex segments. The largest of these channels shows an anastomosed web and modified hills similar to those present on Mars.\n\nAlthough the shape of these channels is highly suggestive of fluid erosion, there is no evidence that they were formed by water. In fact, there is no evidence of water anywhere on Venus in the last 600 million years. While the most popular theory for the channels' formation is that they are the result of thermal erosion by lava, there are other hypotheses, including that they were formed by heated fluids formed and ejected during impacts.\n\nLiquid water and ice are nonexistent on Venus, and thus the only agent of physical erosion to be found (apart from thermal erosion by lava flows) is wind. Wind tunnel experiments have shown that the density of the atmosphere allows the transport of sediments with even a small breeze. Therefore, the seeming rarity of eolian land forms must have some other cause. This implies that transportable sand-size particles are relatively scarce on the planet; which would be a result of very slow rates of mechanical erosion. The process that is most important for the production of sediment on Venus may be crater-forming impact events, which is bolstered by the seeming association between impact craters and downwind eolian land forms.\n\nThis process is manifest in the ejecta of impact craters expelled onto the surface of Venus. The material ejected during a meteorite impact is lifted to the atmosphere, where winds transport the material toward the west. As the material is deposited on the surface, it forms parabola-shaped patterns. This type of deposit can be established on top of various geologic features or lava flows. Therefore, these deposits are the youngest structures on the planet. Images from \"Magellan\" reveal the existence of more than 60 of these parabola-shaped deposits that are associated with crater impacts.\n\nThe ejection material, transported by the wind, is responsible for the process of renovation of the surface at speeds, according to the measurements of the \"Venera\" soundings, of approximately one metre per second. Given the density of the lower Venusian atmosphere, the winds are more than sufficient to provoke the erosion of the surface and the transportation of fine-grained material. In the regions covered by ejection deposits one may find wind lines, dunes, and yardangs. The wind lines are formed when the wind blows ejection material and volcanic ash, depositing it on top of topographic obstacles such as domes. As a consequence, the leeward sides of domes are exposed to the impact of small grains that remove the surface cap. Such processes expose the material beneath, which has a different roughness, and thus different characteristics under radar, compared to formed sediment.\n\nThe dunes are formed by the depositing of particulates that are the size of grains of sand and have wavy shapes. Yardangs are formed when the wind-transported material carves the fragile deposits and produces deep furrows.\n\nThe line-shaped patterns of wind associated with impact craters follow a trajectory in the direction of the equator. This tendency suggests the presence of a system of circulation of Hadley cells between medium latitudes and the equator. \"Magellan\" radar data confirm the existence of strong winds that blow toward the east in the upper surface of Venus, and meridional winds on the surface.\n\nChemical and mechanical erosion of the old lava flows is caused by reactions of the surface with the atmosphere in the presence of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide (see carbonate-silicate cycle for details). These two gases are the planet's first and third most abundant gases, respectively; the second most abundant gas is inert nitrogen. The reactions probably include the deterioration of silicates by carbon dioxide to produce carbonates and quartz, as well as the deterioration of silicates by sulfur dioxide to produce anhydrate calcium sulfate and carbon dioxide.\n\nNASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and others have postulated that Venus may have had a shallow ocean in the past for up to 2 billion years, with as much water as Earth. Depending on the parameters used in their theoretical model, the last liquid water could have evaporated as recently as 715 million years ago. Currently, the only known water on Venus is in the form of a tiny amount of atmospheric vapor (20 ppm). Hydrogen, a component of water, is still being lost to space nowadays as detected by ESA's Venus Express spacecraft.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Three years later he and other organisers of the theatre's gallery space left the Traverse to establish what became the Richard Demarco Gallery. The gallery, which doubled as a performance venue during the Edinburgh Fringe, ran from 1966 to 1992.\n\nFor many years, the Demarco Gallery promoted cultural links with Eastern Europe, both in terms of presenting artists such as Paul Neagu from 1969, Marina Abramović from 1973 and Neue Slowenische Kunst from 1986 within Scotland, organising exhibitions of contemporary Polish, Romanian and Yugoslav art and in establishing outgoing connections for Scottish artists across Europe.\n\nRichard Demarco's involvement with the artist Joseph Beuys led to various presentations, from \"Strategy Get Arts\" in 1970 to Beuys' hunger strike during the \"Jimmy Boyle Days\" in 1980.\n\nAlso particularly notable were the presentations by Tadeusz Kantor's \"Cricot 2\" group during the 1970s and 1980s, including a celebrated unofficial performance of \"The Water Hen\" at the former Edinburgh poorhouse during the 1972 Edinburgh Festival. \"Cricot 2\" returned to Edinburgh in later years. Demarco introduced Beuys and Kantor to one another and in one performance of \"Lovelies and Dowdies\" Beuys performed under Kantor's direction.\n\nFor many years, after the Scottish Arts Council withdrew its annual grant in 1980 following controversy associated with Joseph Beuys' support for Jimmy Boyle, the Demarco Gallery led a financially straitened existence. Since the early 1990s, Richard Demarco's activity has continued under the auspices of the \"Demarco European Art Foundation\".\n\nIn November 2008 a substantial selection from Demarco's archives, covering the period 1963–1980, was made available on-line by the University of Dundee [see below for direct link to online archive]. Images of Demarco's activities during this period, in particular collaborations with Joseph Beuys, Tadeusz Kantor, Paul Neagu and Marina Abramović are available in the selection from the Demarco archives. Detailed documentation of the Edinburgh Arts journeys from 1972 to 1980 are also available in this selection.\n\nDemarco has presented several thousand art exhibitions, plays, music, conferences, and various other performances, mainly in Edinburgh, involving artists from at least sixty countries, including all of central and eastern Europe during the Cold War, North and South America, all countries of western Europe, Australasia, and from Southern Africa, Middle East, and other parts of Asia. Exhibitions and festival programmes were also organised by him and his Demarco European Arts Foundation in other countries including Poland, Lithuania, Croatia, Bosnia, Malta, Georgia, Hungary, Italy to name but a few. His 'Edinburgh Arts' journeys criss-crossed all of Europe, taking artists and academics from other countries alongside those of Scotland to visit interesting people, great collections, cities, landscapes, and events, to examine Europe's cultural history of the past 5,000 years. It is for his consistent internationalism that he was being successfully nominated as European Citizen of the Year 2013. This also followed from his exhibition \"Scotland in Europe: Europe in Scotland\" in Brussels in 2011. His own artworks were included in the Italian pavilion of the 2011 Venice Biennale. In 2013 Demarco organised an Italo-Scottish pavilion at the Venice Biennale, his fourth pavilion there.\n\nRichard Demarco has attended every Edinburgh Festival and mounted arts programmes in most of them including major art exhibitions for the Edinburgh International Festival, also called the 'official festival'. He has been extensively involved with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe since its inception, while also being highly critical of it in recent decades for delivering too much shallow entertainment in what is the largest arts festival in the world with over 3,500 productions and 40,000 performances every August. Over the years he has put on a wide variety of challenging theatre productions, art exhibitions and other cultural events. Many of the artists, actors, directors, musicians, film makers who first appeared outside their home countries at his Edinburgh festival venues subsequently became world-renowned such as Tadeusz Kantor, Yvette Bozsik, and Marina Abramović.\n\nThe gallery venue was never run for profit; many performers were allowed to put on productions or exhibit at little or no cost. And Demarco himself has been no stranger to artistic and commercial risks. For instance, in 1995, his venue hosted a group of artists flown out from the then besieged city of Sarajevo alongside an opera installation by the young Damien Hirst. During the Cold War Demarco crossed the Iron Curtain 100 times bringing hundreds of artists and arts groups out of Central and Eastern Europe to perform at the Edinburgh Festival. His programs of more than 1,000 art exhibitions and several thousand performing arts productions, and have included artists from more than 60 countries. His ethos is to remain faithful to the founding principle of the Edinburgh Festival, which is to heal the wounds of war through the languages of the arts. Demarco is one of the most widely recognised and best loved arts figures in Scotland and far beyond.\n\nNo stranger to media controversy, Demarco has challenged successive Fringe organisers' boundaries by staging festival productions outside Edinburgh. These have included a full costume, full length production of Shakespeare's Macbeth staged on Inchcolm Island in the Firth of Forth.\n\nAlways a controversial figure, not least in constantly emphasising the importance of recalling festival history and high art values however avant-garde, his approach has not always sat easily with the Scottish arts establishment as the Fringe has become increasingly driven by commercial considerations that led to over-dominance of the Comedy Festival in the Edinburgh fringe.\n\nFrom 1999, Demarco's involvement at the Fringe was in collaboration with Rocket Venues founder Xela Batchelder, as Demarco-Rocket Productions. In 2003, Rocket Venues took over the Roxy (also sometimes known as the Demarco Roxy) Art House, a converted church on the corner of Roxburgh Place and Drummond Street on the South Side of Edinburgh, previously used by the Pleasance Theatre (Pleasance Over-the-Road). In 2008 the building was sold to another organisation, who doubled the rent and subsequently left Rocket Venues without a home. Richard Demarco and Xela Batchelder (now a full-time Associate Professor) still collaborate on educational and festival type projects, but on a smaller scale.\n\nSince the 2011 festival, moving from Craigcrook Castle, Demarco's new home for his archives, exhibitions, theatre and other events is Summerhall at the East end of The Meadows, Edinburgh Southside, Europe's largest private multi-arts centre where 1,300 productions including over 100 art shows are staged annually. Summerhall was for a century the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies until purchased from Edinburgh University in November 2011 by buyers closely associated with Demarco over many years. The veterinary school moved to a new campus outside the city at Easter Bush.\n\nDemarco was a regular contributor to ArtReview, then titled Arts Review throughout the 1980s.\n\nPreviously appointed as an OBE, he was raised to a CBE in the New Year Honours List in December 2006. In 1976, Richard Demarco received a Gold Medal from the Polish government and in 1986, he was made a Cavaliere of the Italian Republic. In 1992 he received the Witkacy Prize. In 2012 he received gold medals simultaneously from both Germany and Poland following a major retrospective entitled Ten Dialogues at the Royal Scottish Academy. Later in the same year he received a gold medal from Romania and another from the Culture Minister of Poland in Warsaw. He has been awarded honorary doctorates by universities in Europe and North America and, from 1993 to 2000, he was Professor of European Culture at the University of Kingston. He received the European Citizen's Medal on Monday 19 August 2013, in a ceremony held at the European Parliament Office, Brussels, the only UK citizen and only arts person receiving this honour. Also, in 2013, Demarco was featured in an episode of the BBC's The Culture Show hosted by Sue Perkins. The episode celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Traverse Theatre. On Monday 24 March 2014, Demarco received an engraved Loving Cup from Edinburgh City Council presented by the Lord Provost in the City Chambers. At the ceremony, Ron Butlin, the Edinburgh Makar, recited a poem commissioned especially for the occasion. An impression of Demarco's handprints has been immortalised on a flagstone in the City Chambers quadrangle alongside previous Edinburgh Award recipients Ian Rankin, JK Rowling, George Kerr, Sir Chris Hoy, Professor Peter Higgs and Elizabeth Blackadder.\n\n"}

Its main aims were the promotion of Germanization of Poles living in Prussia and destruction of Polish national identity in German eastern provinces. Contrary to many similar nationalist organizations created in that period, the Ostmarkenverein had relatively close ties with the government and local administration, which made it largely successful, even though it opposed both the policy of seeking some \"modo vivendi\" with the Poles pursued by Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg and Leo von Caprivi's policies of relaxation of anti-Polish measures. While of limited significance and often overrated, the organization formed a notable part of German anti-democratic pluralist part of the political landscape of the Wilhelmine era.\n\nInitially formed in Posen, in 1896 its main headquarters was moved to Berlin. In 1901 it had roughly 21,000 members, the number rose to 48,000 in 1913, though some authors claim the membership was as high as 220,000. After Poland was re-established following World War I in 1918, the society continued its rump activities in the Weimar Republic until it was closed down by the Nazis in 1934 who created the new organisation with similar activity Bund Deutscher Osten.\n\nFollowing the Partitions of Poland in late 18th century, a large part of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (namely the regions of Greater Poland and Royal, the later West Prussia) was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, the predecessor of the German Empire, which was formed in 1871. Primarily inhabited by Poles, Greater Poland initially was formed into a semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Posen, granted with a certain level of self-governance. However, under Otto von Bismarck's government, the ethnic and cultural tensions in the region began to rise. This was paired by growing tendencies of nationalism, imperialism, and chauvinism within the German society. The tendencies went in two different directions, but were linked to each other. On one hand, a new world order was demanded with desires of creating a German colonial empire. And on the other, feelings of hostility towards other national groups within the German state were growing.\n\nThe situation was further aggravated by Bismarck's policies of Kulturkampf that in Posen Province took on a much more nationalistic character than in other parts of Germany and included a number of specifically anti-Polish laws that resulted in the Polish and German communities living in a virtual apartheid. Many observers believed these policies only further stoked the Polish independence movement. There is also a question regarding possible personal antipathy towards Poles behind Bismarck's motivation in pursuing the Kulturkampf. Unlike in other parts of the German Empire, in Greater Poland—then known under the German name of \"Provinz Posen\"—the Kulturkampf did not cease after the end of the decade. Although Bismarck finally signed an informal alliance with the Catholic Church against the socialists, the policies of Germanization did continue in Polish-inhabited parts of the country. However, with the end of von Bismarck's rule and the advent of Leo von Caprivi, the pressure for Germanisation was lessened and many German landowners feared that this would lead to lessening the German control over the Polish areas and in the end deprive Germany of what they saw as a natural reservoir of workforce and land. Although the actual extent of von Caprivi's concessions towards the Poles was very limited, the German minority of Greater Poland feared that this was a step too far, and that von Caprivi's government would cede the power in Greater Poland to the Polish clergy and nobility. The Hakata slogan was: \"You are standing opposite to the most dangerous, fanatic enemy of German existence, German honour and German reputation in the world: The Poles.\"\n\nUnder such circumstances a number of nationalist organizations and pressure groups was formed, all collectively known as the \"nationale Verbände\". Among them were the Pan-German League, German Navy League, German Colonial Society, German Anti-Semitic Organization, and the Defence League. Many landowners feared that their interests would not be properly represented by those organizations and decided to form their own society. It was officially launched November 3, 1894 in Poznań, then referred to under its German name of \"Posen\". The opening meeting elected an assembly and a general committee composed of 227 members, among them 104 from the Province of Posen and Province of West Prussia, and additional 113 from other parts of German Empire. The social base of the newly founded society was wide and included a large spectrum of people. Some 60% of the representatives of areas of Germany primarily inhabited by Poles were the Junkers, the landed aristocracy, mostly with ancient feudal roots. The rest were all groups of middle class Germans, that is civil servants (30%), teachers (25%), merchants, craftsmen, Protestant priests, and clerks.\n\nThe official aims of the society was \"strengthening and rallying of Germandom in the Eastern Marches through the revival and consolidation of German national feeling and the economic strengthening of the German people\" in the area. This was seen as justified due to alleged passivity of Germans in the eastern territories. Officially it was to work for the Germans rather than against the Poles. However, in reality the aims of the society were anti-Polish and aimed at ousting the Polish landowners and peasants from their land at all cost. It was argued that the Poles were an insidious threat to German national and cultural integrity and domination in the east. The propagandistic rationale behind formation of the H-K-T was presented as a national Polish-German struggle to assimilate one group into the other. It was argued that either the Poles would be successfully Germanized, or the Germans living in the east would face the Polonization themselves. This conflict was often portrayed as a constant biological struggle between the \"eastern barbarity\" and \"European culture\". To counter the alleged threat, the Society promoted the destruction of Polish national identity in the Polish lands held by Germany, and prevention of \"polonization\" of the Eastern Marches, that is the growing national sentiment amongst local Poles paired with migration of Poles from rural areas to the cities of the region.\n\nIn accordance with the views of Chancellor von Bismarck himself, the Society saw the language question as a key factor in determining one's loyalty towards the state. Because of this view, it insisted on extending the ban on usage of the Polish language in schools, to other instances of everyday life, including public meetings, books, and newspapers. During a 1902 meeting in Danzig (modern Gdańsk), the Society demanded from the government that the Polish language be banned even from voluntary classes in schools and universities, that the language be banned from public usage and that the Polish language newspapers be either liquidated or forced to be printed in bilingual versions.\n\nWith limited local success and support, the Ostmarkenverein functioned primarily as a nationwide propaganda and pressure group. Its press organ, the \"Die Ostmark\" (Eastern March) was one of the primary sources of information on the \"Polish Question\" for the German public and shaped the national-conservative views towards the ethnic conflict in the eastern territories of Germany. The Society also opened a number of libraries in the Polish-dominated areas, where it supported the literary production of books and novels promoting an aggressive stance against the Poles. The popular \"Ostmarkenromane\" (Ostmark novels) depicted Poles as non-white and struggled to portray a two race dichotomy between \"black\" Poles and \"white\" Germans\n\nHowever, it did not limit itself to mere cultural struggle for domination but also promoted a physical removal of the Poles from their lands in order to make space for the German colonization. The pressure of the H-K-T indeed made the government of von Caprivi adopt a firmer stance against the Poles. The ban on Polish schools was reintroduced and all teaching was to be done in German language. The ban was also used by the German police to harass the Polish trade union movement as they interpreted all public meetings as educational undertakings.\n\nAn important issue was the colonisation of Polish territory: the organisation actively supported the nationalist policy of Germanisation through removal of Polish population and promoting settlement of ethnic Germans in the eastern regions of the German Empire. It was among the main supporters of creation of the Settlement Commission, an official authority with a fund to buy up the land from the Poles and redistribute it among German settlers. Since 1905 the organisation also proposed and lobbied for a law that would allow forced eviction of Polish owners of land, and succeed in 1908 when the law was eventually passed. However, it remained on paper in the following years, to which the H-K-T responded with large scale propaganda campaign in the press. The campaign proved to be successful and on October 12, 1912 the Prussian government issued a decision allowing eviction of Polish property owners in Greater Poland.\n\nAlthough the H-K-T is to this day primarily associated with the Junkers, it was one of the groups to oppose the Society's goals the most. Initially treated with reserve by most of the conservative Prussian aristocracy, with time it became actively opposed by many of them. The Society opposed any immigration of Poles from the Russian Poland to the area, while the Junkers gained large profits from seasonal workers migrating there every year, mostly from other parts of Poland. Also the German colonists brought to formerly Polish lands by the Settlement Commission or the German government largely benefited from the cooperation with their Polish neighbours and mostly either ignored the \"Hakatisten\" or even actively opposed their ideas. This made the Ostmarkenverein an organization formed mostly by the German bourgeoisie and settlers, that is middle class members of the local administration, and not the Prussian Junkers. Other notable group of supporters included the local artisans and businessmen, whose interests were endangered by the organic work, that is the Polish response to the economical competition promoted by the Settlement Commission and other similar organizations. In a sample probe of H-K-T's members, the social classes represented were as follows:\n\nBy 1913 the Society had roughly 48,000 members. Despite its fierce rhetoric, support from the local administration and certain popularity of its goals, the Society proved to be largely unsuccessful as were the projects it promoted. Much like other similar organizations, the H-K-T not only managed to incite some public awareness to the \"Polish Question\" within German public and radicalise the German policies in the area, but also sparked a Polish reaction. As an effect of the external pressure, the Poles living in the German Empire started to organize themselves in order to prevent the plans of Germanisation. In addition, the main opposition centre on the Polish side became the middle class rather than aristocracy, which strengthened the Polish resistance and intensified the national sentiment within the Polish society. Also, the pressure from the German nationalists resulted in strengthening the Polish national-democrats, particularly the Polish National-Democratic Party of Roman Dmowski, and Wojciech Korfanty.\n\nFor instance, the Settlement Commission throughout the 27 years of its existence managed to plant about 25,000 German families on 1,240 km² (479 mi²) of land in Greater Poland and Pomerania. However, at the same time the reaction of Polish societies resulted in about 35,000 new Polish farmers being settled in the area of roughly 1,500 km² (579 mi²) of land. Similarly, the attempts at banning the teaching of religion in Polish language met with a nationwide resistance and several school strikes that sparked a campaign in foreign media.\n\nAll in all, even though the H-K-T Society was not the most influential and its exact influence on the German governments is disputable, it was among the best-heard and for the Polish people became one of the symbols of oppression, chauvinism, and national discrimination, thus poisoning the Polish-German relations both in the borderland and in entire Germany. On the eve of World War I the nationalisms on both sides ran high and the liberal politicians who were seeking some compromise with the German Empire were seen as traitors, while German politicians trying to tone down the aggressive rhetoric on both sides were under attack from the Hakatisten. This situation proved vital to the failure of German plans of creation of Mitteleuropa during the Great War, as the Polish political scene was taken over mostly by politicians hostile to Germany.\n\nThe works of the Ostmarkenverein practically ceased during the war. At its end, some of its members joined the \"Deutsche Vereinigung\" (\"German Association\"), a society that aimed at preventing newly restored Poland from acquiring the lands that were formerly in Prussia. Many more of its members feared possible Polish reprisals after the take-over of Greater Poland, Pomerania and Silesia, and were among the first to pack their belongings and head westwards after the armistice, while others stayed in the lands that were taken over by Poland, protected by the Minority Treaty. Even though the Ostmarkenverein had lost its main rationale as Germany had no influence over the lands of the Republic of Poland, it continued to exist in a rump form. Headed from Berlin, it tried to force the government of the Weimar Republic to use the threat of reprisals against the remaining Polish minority in Germany in order to win further concessions for the German minority in Poland. However, the post-war government of Gustav Stresemann mostly rejected the pleas as there were many more Germans in Poland than Poles in Germany, and such a tit-for-tat tactics would harm the German side more. The Society continued to exist in Berlin, limiting its activities mostly to a press campaign and rhetoric, but its meaning was seriously limited. Finally, after the advent of Adolf Hitler's rule in Germany, it was disbanded by the Nazis. Some of its former members, now living in Poland, remained members of other German societies and organizations, and formed the core of the German Fifth column during the German Invasion of Poland of 1939.\n\n\n"}

In June 1817, a band of Cherokee Indians and their allies, under Chief Spring Frog (\"Too-an-tuh\"), attacked Pasuga, an Osage Indian village at the foot of Claremore Mound, killing thirty-eight Osage, including their Chief Glahmo, and taking one hundred and four captives. In revenge, the Osage attacked the Cherokee for the next twenty years, led by \"Wah-tianka\", Glahmo's son. The mound is located north of Sageeyah near the south bank of the Verdigris River. \n\nThe earthwork mound, likely constructed before 1000CE by the Caddoan Mississippian culture, has an elevation of above sea level. The area on top of the mound, where the Osage built a village called Pasona about 1802, is about . Parts of the Cherokee reservation, established in the late 1830s in Indian Territory, lay about to the west. The later, modern city of Claremore was developed by European Americans about away. \n\nEuropean-American settlers designated both the mound and the nearby town as Clermont (\"clear mountain\" in English) in honor of Chief Glahmo, who French traders had nicknamed Chief Clermont. When the town petitioned for a post office in 1874, a clerical error listed Clermont as Claremore; the error was never rectified and today both the mound and the town are named Claremore. \n\n\n"}

The team struggled in the first class matches, where they drew two and lost three matches, and only looked like having a chance of winning in the last match against Kent. The one-day series went slightly better, with Bangladesh A winning two, losing one and abandoning a fourth, but for a second string national team against mainly second elevens from English domestic cricket, it was a highly disappointing tour.\n\nBritish Universities beat Bangladesh A by two wickets\n\nIn a twelve-a-side match at The Parks, Oxford, a strong Bangladesh A side including nine internationals went down to a combined universities side, admittedly including two current county professionals. Bangladesh A batted first, and made 249 for 6 in their 50 overs, Nafees Iqbal top-scoring with 109, while young prodigy Mushfiqur Rahim also made 50. Bangladesh A proceeded to gift away 35 extras - including 21 in wides - which probably cost them the match, as the Universities passed their score with ten balls remaining. Talha Jubair and Abdur Razzak showed promising things with the ball, though, taking four for 50 and two for 37 respectively.\n\nGloucestershire won by 130 runs\n\nBangladesh A, still without a win on tour of England, shocked Gloucestershire initially at Bristol. Shahadat Hossain took three wickets for the tourists, and Syed Rasel and Talha Jubair also chipped in, as Gloucestershire imploded to 72 for 7. However, 83 from wicketkeeper Stephen Snell lifted them to 232, before Jon Lewis and James Averis dug into the tourists to reduce them to 29 for 3. However, Tushar Imran played his way to his fourth first-class century, a career-best 119, to give the tourists a slender lead of 19 after a 122-run fourth-wicket stand between Tushar and Alok Kapali. However, Gloucestershire were determined to prove their class the second time around, and after losing Kadeer Ali for 1 after half an hour they were in control, batting their way to 330 for 5 in just 65.1 overs before declaring as Alex Gidman recorded a 94-ball century. Sri Lankan overseas player Malinga Bandara then took five for 45 with his leg-spin as the tourists imploded from 106 for 2 to 181 all out.\n\nMatch abandoned without a ball bowled\n\nRain at Rose Bowl, Southampton prevented Bangladesh A from playing their third scheduled match on their tour of England, against Hampshire.\n\nMatch drawn\n\nAfter a first day where Glamorgan had racked up 380 runs, Michael Powell top-scoring with 111 and Alex Wharf making 77 while Syed Rasel took four for 89, the touring Bangladesh A side were sent in to bat. Only 10.1 overs of play was possible on the second day, though, and Andrew Davies took two wickets while Alex Wharf was taken for 36 runs off just five overs. Day three was rained out, so the match at Abergavenny ended in a tame draw, with Bangladesh A finishing on 54 for 2.\n\nBangladesh A won by seven wickets (D/L Method)\n\nLancashire put out a second-string side against Bangladesh A, admittedly including former ODI bowler Sajid Mahmood, and were duly punished by the tourists, who cruised to a seven-wicket victory. Having won the toss, the Bangladeshis chose to bowl at Lancashire, and after Andrew Crook and Iain Sutcliffe had put on 35 for the first wicket, Shahadat Hossain dug out two quick wickets. Lancashire recovered somewhat before rain stopped play for nearly two hours, but when the players returned, Abdur Razzak ran through the middle order. He took three wickets for 25, and Lancashire collapsed to 149, with two run outs. Bangladesh were set 152 to win due to the rain interruption, and the tourists scored slowly before Tushar Imran came to the crease. Tushar took 91 balls to forge 93 runs, his sixth one-day fifty, as he guided Bangladesh A to a total of 155 for 3 with more than 15 overs remaining in the match.\n\nYorkshire won by 126 runs\n\nA second-string Yorkshire pummeled the Bangladeshi bowlers, and despite the short timeframe - three days instead of the County Championship's four - they still got a win. With a run-rate of more than four an over they quickly made their way to 357 for 2 on the first day - Matthew Wood made an unbeaten 202, five short of his career highest score, and shared an opening partnership worth 272 with Joe Sayers. In reply, Tushar Imran made his second first-class century on tour, and the fifth of his career, with 116 in a little over three hours, and 19-year-old Nazimuddin made 60 as the tourists made their way to 325 - left-armer David Lucas taking five for 49. Yorkshire lost two wickets before stumps to be 48 for 2, but Michael Lumb made a century on the final day to ensure continued Yorkshire domination as they declared on 240 for 2, setting Bangladesh a target of 273 in three and a half hours. Lucas continued on his fine form from the first innings, taking three wickets, and no Bangladeshi passed 30 as they succumbed for 146 - Lucas took three for 35, fellow left-armer David Wainwright took three for 22 with his spin, and even part-time medium-pacer Richard Pyrah got one wicket in his two overs.\n\nBangladesh A won by 68 runs\n\n147 from Shahriar Nafees and Nazimuddin's seven-ball 28 - which included three sixes, two fours and a two before he was caught and bowled off Ben Harmison - lifted Bangladesh A to a massive 299 for 6 in 50 overs, despite Neil Killeen removing Tushar Imran and Alok Kapali with successive balls mid-innings. Nafees had paired up with Mehrab Hossain for 209 for the first wicket. Durham started with a 40-run opening partnership, but Syed Rasel and Shahadat Hossain both took two wickets with successive balls, separated by a few overs. Shahadat went on to take four for 34, while Australian Callum Thorp top-scored with 52 - in vain, as Durham imploded to 213. Durham's captain and opener Lowe ground out 36 runs from 80 deliveries to halt Durham's chase severely.\n\nMatch drawn\n\nA Surrey team including two former internationals - England batsman Mark Butcher returning from injury, and the retiring Pakistani spin bowler Saqlain Mushtaq - amassed 336 for 5 before declaring after 74 overs at The Oval. The internationals made little impact in the first innings, however, as Butcher was caught for 5 and Saqlain did not bat. James Benning slashed 22 boundaries in his 124 before being run out, and wicketkeeper Andrew Hodd made an unbeaten 50 in his first first-class game. Bangladesh A battled well in reply, equalling Surrey's score before they were bowled out, while Saqlain got three for 82. Tushar Imran continued on his rich vein of form, making 70 and top-scoring. Scott Newman and Richard Clinton led Surrey to 73 without loss, but two quick wickets from Talha Jubair turned the game slightly. Mark Butcher repaired his first innings failure, however, as he made 90 to lead Surrey to 332 for 6 before they declared again. Jubair got four for 99 from an expensive 19 overs. However, the task of surviving 24 overs was easy enough for the tourists, who only lost one wicket, that of Shahriar Nafees who made a quickfire 63. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nKent won by three wickets\n\nEighteen wickets fell on the frantic first day at St Lawrence Ground, and nineteen on the second, as two teams clashed in an interesting, low scoring match that lasted for only 173.4 overs. The Bangladesh A tourists had won the coin toss and chosen to bat, but immediately lost Nafees Iqbal for a duck. However, Tushar Imran made 86, and with some help from Shahriar Nafees (with 30) and Nazimuddin (27), he took the score to 185. That total did not look challenging, but that was before Syed Rasel's medium pace came to the scene. After Niall O'Brien and Neil Dexter put on 13 for the first wicket for Kent, Rasel and Shahadat Hossain dug out two wickets each, as Kent lost four wickets for two runs. Rasel took three more wickets before stumps on day one, and two more on the second morning, to end with seven for 50 - the only five-wicket-haul of Bangladesh A on the tour. However, only Shahriar Nafees passed 20 in the second innings, Tushar lost his golden touch (before this innings, he had made 455 runs at a batting average of 65) to only scamper 12 runs, while Antiguan-born Robbie Joseph took five for 19 with his pace bowling. Kent were set 188 to win, and lost wickets at regular intervals, but 54 from the first-class debutant Dexter turned out to be crucial as Kent made it with three wickets to spare.\n"}

{"id": "2200407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200407", "title": "Malta-class aircraft carrier", "text": "Malta-class aircraft carrier\n\nThe \"Malta\"-class aircraft carrier was a British large aircraft carrier design of World War II. Four ships were ordered in 1943 for the Royal Navy, but changing tactical concepts, based on American experience in the Pacific War, caused repeated changes to the design, which was not completed before the end of the war. All four ships were cancelled in 1945 before they were laid down.\n\nIn July 1942 the Royal Navy formed the Future Building Committee, chaired by the Deputy First Sea Lord, to examine the fleet's requirements for the rest of the war. Tasked with anticipating the Navy's readiness and requirements for January 1944, the committee realised that a major expansion of naval aviation was required, which meant that more aircraft carriers would be needed. Many factors combined to drive up the size of these new carriers, notably the increasing size and speed of aircraft and the desire to increase the numbers of aircraft aboard fleet carriers. Another important consideration was the change in carrier tactics from the earlier doctrine of more attacks with smaller numbers of aircraft to the use of large, single airstrikes.\n\nSir Stanley V. Goodall, Director of Naval Construction (DNC), proposed a variety of designs, both open and closed hangar. On 8 October 1943, the Board of Admiralty selected a closed-hangar design with an armoured flight deck and five propeller shafts. Reports of American operations in the Pacific convinced the Board to reconsider hangar design; American experience had shown that the ability to fly off all of a carrier's aircraft in a single airstrike was vital. That required a well-ventilated, open-hangar design, which would reduce the time required to launch the aircraft by allowing them to begin the typical 15-minute engine warm-up while still in the hangar. On 15 May 1944, the Board reversed itself and ordered the DNC to produce an open-hangar design with deck-edge lifts. An unarmoured flight deck was agreed upon in June by the Controller of the Navy and the Fifth Sea Lord.\n\nThe new design, long at the waterline and known as Design X, was submitted to the Board on 10 August, although it was not approved. In October, concerns arose over the size of Design X in that it might have problems manoeuvering in constricted harbours, and the DNC was asked for two smaller designs: X1, shorter, and Y, shorter. Design Y was too short for efficient operations with the larger aircraft the committee anticipated, and the First Sea Lord selected X1. It was submitted to the Board on 12 April 1945 and fully worked out in anticipation of approval that never came. The Board minutes for 31 August noted that further consideration of the design had been postponed.\n\nHad the X1 design received final approval, the \"Malta\" class would have been about the same size as the American s at in length overall and at the waterline. The beam would have been at the waterline and they would have had a draught of at deep load. The ships would have displaced at standard load and at deep load. Their metacentric heights were estimated to be at standard load and at deep load. Their complement was expected to consist of 3,520 officers and enlisted men.\n\nThe flight deck had a maximum width of . Because the unarmoured flight deck required an expansion joint about amidships, the \"Malta\"s' island could not be a single structure and was split into two, each section with its own funnel. This allowed turbulence around the islands to be reduced and provided more space for radars and fire-control directors. The carriers would have been fitted with 16 arrestor cables that were designed to stop landing aircraft up to in weight, at speeds of up to . They would have been backed up by three crash barricades to prevent landing aircraft from crashing into aircraft parked on the ship's bow. Positioned on the forward part of the flight deck, two newly designed hydraulic aircraft catapults were intended to launch fully laden aircraft at . The ships were designed with four lifts (two on the centreline (, and two on the portside deck edge () to facilitate the rapid movement of aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar. This was long, with a maximum width of , and high to accommodate American aircraft designed for that height. In case of fire the hangar was intended to be divided by four sliding steel doors. Between the hangar spaces and the deck park, the \"Malta\" class would have been capable of accommodating between 80 and 108 aircraft. For these aircraft, the ships would have been provided with of aviation gasoline.\n\nThe ships would have used four Parsons double-reduction geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam supplied by eight Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The boilers were distributed between four boiler compartments, but all four turbines were in a single compartment, well aft. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , enough to give them a maximum speed of . The \"Malta\" class was designed to carry a maximum of of fuel oil and diesel fuel (for the emergency generators); this was intended to give the ships a range of at or at .\n\nThe ships' main armament was intended to be sixteen quick-firing (QF) dual-purpose guns in eight powered RP 41 Mk VII twin-gun turrets, four on each side of the hull. The gun had a maximum range of at an elevation of +45° and a ceiling of . The light anti-aircraft (AA) armament would have consisted of 55 40 mm Bofors AA guns in eight sextuple stabilised, powered RP 50 Mk VI mounts and seven single mounts of an unknown type. The Bofors gun had a maximum range of and a ceiling of .\n\nAn August 1944 study anticipated that the ships would carry four early warning radars, including height-finders, four surface search radars and eight gunnery/fire-control radars. Historian David Hobbs wrote that they would mount Type 960 early warning, Type 982 intercept, Type 983 height-finding and Type 293M target indication radars. In addition a number of gunnery radars would also be needed.\n\nThe hangar-deck armour of Design X1 was a reduction from the called for in the original X configuration. The waterline armour belt was also four inches thick, but only covered the central portion of the ship to form the armoured citadel. The belt was closed by transverse bulkheads fore and aft. of armour extended forward and aft of the belt to protect the waterline against splinter damage.\n\nThe underwater defense system was a layered system of liquid- and air-filled compartments, backed by an inclined holding bulkhead that was four inches thick at the top and tapered to a thickness of at the bottom, and was estimated to resist a explosive charge. An earlier version, however, had been estimated to be able to resist a charge, but failed against a charge in a full-scale test.\n\nThe magazines for the 4.5-inch guns and the steering gear both lay outside the armoured citadel and had their own armour. The magazines had four-inch roofs and sides, with three-inch ends while the steering gear also had a four-inch roof, but only three-inch sides and ends.\n\nWell before the design was finalised, four ships were ordered in July 1943. \"Africa\" was originally ordered as an unnamed \"Audacious\"-class carrier, but the order was modified to a \"Malta\"-class ship on 12 July 1943. \"Malta\", \"New Zealand\" and \"Gibraltar\" were all ordered three days later. \"New Zealand\" was originally ordered from Cammell Laird, but the contract was transferred to Harland and Wolff on 22 July 1944. The Admiralty ordered Vickers not to order any more material on 27 April 1944 and given that final drawings were never issued to the builders, it is unlikely that any of them actually did more than preliminary work. None of the ships were ever laid down and all of them were cancelled before the end of 1945.\n\n\n"}

It was built in 1953 by the third king of Bhutan \"Druk Gyalpo\" Jigme Dorji Wangchuck.\n\nThe palace lies at the northern end of the Thimphu Valley, on the west bank of the Thimphu River. The palace is accessed via the Dechhen Lam (road) which runs along the eastern bank of the Thimphu river from the district of Yangchenphug, through Langjupakha for several kilometres before approaching the palace. On the way to the palace the road passes the Royal Banquet Hall, the Centre for Bhutan Studies, the Woodcraft Centre and then passes the Indian Estate on the other side of the river. Just south of the palace on the other side of the river is the suburb of Taba. The palace is surrounded by forest to the east and west; the eastern forest is denser and is said to be the only leafy forest in the city. Opposite on a slope in the forest high above Taba is the Wangchuck Resort, used as a meditation retreat (the retreat has no connection to the palace).\n\nDechencholing Palace was built in 1953 after the coronation of the third King of Bhutan, \"Druk Gyalpo\" Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, following the death of his father, \"Druk Gyalpo\" Jigme Wangchuck, in 1952. The third king's son Jigme Singye Wangchuck was born here on 11 November 1955. Later, one hundred thousand \"Raksha Thotreng\" rituals were performed at the palace as a beneficial rite for the public enthronement of the Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1974.\n\nThe late Royal Grandmother, \"Druk Gyalpo\"’s mother the Dowager Queen Phuntsho Choden (\"Ashi\" Phuntsho Choden), popularly known as \"Gayum Angay\" Phuntsho Choden Wangchuck, lived in this palace as a Buddhist nun. However, the present King does not stay in this palace, as the royal residence is now at the Samteling Palace (Royal Cottage).\n\nThe palace is frequently used for international delegations, especially those with India. Indian ambassadors regularly visit the palace to discuss international relations between India and Bhutan. It is also the venue for hosting luncheons and banquets for Head of the States and other important guests of Bhutan.\n\nThe palace is a three-storied building set amidst willow trees, lawns and ponds. Except for the present King, other members of the Royal family reside here. Its architecture is entirely in Bhutanese traditional style including the furnishings inside. The palace interior furnishings are said to be encased in metal in repoussé technique superimposed on white velvet.\n\nThe late Royal Grandmother, \"Gayum\" Phuntsho Choden Wangchuck lived in this palace for many years and possessed her own chapel, adorned with paintings and carvings and candles burning from bowls. \"Gayum\" employed a number of women at the palace to weave garments for men and women, producing national dress costumes.\nAs the palace frequently hosts international delegations, it has its own helipad to facilitate swift access even though there is no airport in Thimphu.\n\nIn 1957, King Jigme Wangchuck commissioned a skilled artist named Lam Durlop Dorji of Bumthang to open an embroidery school at the palace, to instruct some 30 young monks in this field. The school has produced several notable thangka embroideries, notably Thongdrel (large thangkas hanging from the roof tops of monasteries and dzongs), and Thangkas (scroll paintings). As Bhutan is a Tibetan Buddhist nation this school heavily revolves around Buddhism, which is reflected in its artwork.\n\n"}
{"id": "2200415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200415", "title": "Ligurian (Romance language)", "text": "Ligurian (Romance language)\n\nLigurian (\"ligure\" or \"lengua ligure\") is a Gallo-Italic language spoken in Liguria in Northern Italy, parts of the Mediterranean coastal zone of France, Monaco and in the villages of Carloforte and Calasetta in Sardinia. It is part of the Gallo-Italic and Western Romance dialect continuum. The Genoese (\"Zeneize\"), spoken in Genoa, the capital of Liguria, is the language's prestige dialect on which the standard is based.\n\nThere is a long literary tradition of Ligurian poets and writers that goes from the 13th century to the present, such as Luchetto (the Genoese Anonym), Martin Piaggio and Gian Giacomo Cavalli.\nLigurian does not enjoy an official status in Italy. Hence, it is not protected by law. Historically, Genoese (the dialect spoken in the city of Genoa) is the written \"koine\", owing to its semi-official role as language of the Republic of Genoa, its traditional importance in trade and commerce and its vast literature.\n\nLike other regional languages in Italy, the use of Ligurian and its dialects is in rapid decline. ISTAT (the Italian central service of statistics) claims that in 2012, only 9% of the population used a language other than standard Italian with friends and family, which decreases to 1.8% with strangers. Furthermore, according to ISTAT, regional languages are more commonly spoken by uneducated people and the elderly, mostly in rural areas. Liguria is no exception. One can reasonably suppose the age pyramid to be strongly biased toward the elderly who were born before World War II, with proficiency rapidly approaching zero for newer generations. Compared to other regional languages of Italy, Ligurian has experienced a significantly smaller decline which could have been a consequence of its status or the early decline it underwent in the past. The language itself is actively preserved by various groups.\n\nNotable native speakers of Ligurian include Niccolò Paganini, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Christopher Columbus, Eugenio Montale, Giulio Natta, Italo Calvino, and Fabrizio De André. There is also a popular musical group, Buio Pesto, who compose songs entirely in the language.\n\nBecause of the importance of Genoese trade, Ligurian was once spoken well beyond the borders of the modern province. It has since given way to standard varieties, such as Standard Italian and French. In particular, the language is traditionally spoken in coastal, northern Tuscany, southern Piedmont (part of the province of Alessandria), western extremes of Emilia-Romagna (some areas in the province of Piacenza), and in a small area of southern Sardinia (the so-called Tabarchino), where its use is ubiquitous and increasing. Until recently, it was also spoken in the department of the Alpes-Maritimes of France (mostly the Côte d'Azur from the Italian border to and including Monaco), in a township at the southern tip of the French island of Corsica (Bonifacio) and by a large community in Gibraltar (UK). It has been adopted formally in Monaco as the Monégasque dialect; or locally, \"Munegascu\", without the status of official language (that is French). Monaco is the only place where a variety of Ligurian is taught in school.\n\nThe Mentonasc dialect, spoken in the East of the County of Nice, is considered to be a transitional Occitan dialect to Ligurian; conversely, the Roiasc and Pignasc spoken further North in the Eastern margin of the County are Ligurian dialects with Occitan influences.\n\nAs a Gallo-Italic language, Ligurian is most closely related to the Lombard, Piedmontese and Emilian-Romagnol languages, all of which are spoken in neighboring provinces. Unlike the aforementioned languages, however, it exhibits distinct Italian features. No link has been demonstrated by linguistic evidence between Romance Ligurian and the Ligurian language of the ancient Ligurian populations, in the form of a substrate or otherwise. Only the toponyms are known to have survived from ancient Ligurian, the name \"Liguria\" itself being the most obvious example.\n\nVariants of the Ligurian language are:\n\nSemivowels occur as allophones of and , as well as in diphthongs. A sound occurs when a sound occurs after a consonant, or before a vowel (i.e \"poeivan\" ), as well as after a \"q\" sound, .\n\nDiphthong sounds include \"ei\" and \"òu\" .\n\nAccording to the standardised orthography proposed by the Genoese Academia Ligustica do Brenno, the Ligurian alphabet consists of 23 letters of the Latin alphabet, five diacritics, one orthographic ligature, as well as four digraphs and two trigraphs.\n\nThe diacritics are:\n\nThe sound is represented with the ligature , as in \"çitæ\" 'city' .\n\nThe multigraphs are:\n\nAccording to the spelling of the Genoese Academia Ligustica do Brenno:\n\n\n"}

The well-preserved medieval town built above important gold mines is the site of the oldest still-working mint in the world.\n\nThe name is derived from Slovak \"kremeň\", \"kremenina\" (quartz) with a feminine suffix \"-ica\", functioning to create local names.\n\nKremnica was among the major mining towns of the world during the Middle Ages and in the modern era due to the abundant gold ore deposits in the Kremnica Mountains. However, the first evidence of sub-surface mining activities comes from the 9th century.\n\nIn the 13th century the inhabitants of this area were affected by the invasion of the Mongols. Following that difficult period, Hungarian kings invited new colonists from Germany to settle in the region to help replenish the decimated population. Their innovative technology and knowledge restored the mining activities in the town. The first written reference to the town dates back to 1328, when it was granted royal town privileges by King Charles I of Hungary.\n\nThe town's mint was already in existence at the time of the granting of royal privileges. Starting in 1335 the mint produced golden florins and later the famous \"Kremnica ducats\", which were used as an international means of payment as a result of their consistently high purity of gold. It was the most important mint, and later the only one, in the Kingdom of Hungary, in Czechoslovakia and nowadays in Slovakia; the prosperity brought to the town led to it being given the nickname \"Golden Kremnica\".\n\nIn 1331, Kremnica became the seat of the Chamber Count (\"Kammergraf\") who was the head of the most important mining and minting chamber of the Kingdom of Hungary. The Count administered all the mines and mints in twelve counties of the kingdom in the Middle Ages.\n\nAt the end of the 14th century, Kremnica became the capital of the mining towns in central Upper Hungary. The steady annual production of gold and silver guaranteed the prosperous development of the town. In the 15th century Kreminca was the second most important city in the Kingdom of Hungary. The town was continuously being granted new privileges and the deputies of the town occupied the second place in the Hungarian Diet (the first place was reserved for the representatives of Buda, the capital of the Kingdom).\n\nGold mining and coin production in Kremnica culminated in the 14th and 15th centuries. As one of the most important centers of Protestant Reformation in the country, the town belonged to the Protestant \"League of Seven Mining Towns\" together with Banská Belá, Banská Bystrica, Banská Štiavnica, Ľubietová, Nová Baňa, and Pukanec. In the 16th century, the town was a major centre of production of (mostly religious) medals, especially by Joachim Deschler. At the same time however, the miners had to dig deeper and deeper to reach new deposits and the mining conditions deteriorated because of underground water in the shafts. The cost of mining increased and the mining was becoming less profitable. The last gold was extracted in Kremnica in 1970, at which time all the mines were closed. The German population of the town and its surroundings was expelled in 1945 as the conequential punishment by former Czechoslovak government after the World War II.\n\nKremnica lies at an altitude of above sea level and covers an area of . It is located in the Kremnica Mountains on the brook \"Kremnický potok\", which is a tributary of the Hron River. It is located around west of Banská Bystrica (by line), south of Martin and around from Bratislava.\n\nThe castle built in the 13th through 15th centuries towers over the town. In the first half of the 14th century, it became the residence of the Chamber Count. The town was immediately fortified with a double wall containing several bastions and towers. The castle represents a unique example of a very well preserved fortification system in Central Europe. In the 14th century, it developed into a multifunctional complex of buildings and thus became the centre of local administration, religious life, and defense. At the end of the 15th century, the Chamber Count moved to a newly built house with a unique diamond vault. Thereafter the residence of the Count in the castle was converted into the St. Catherine's Church.\n\nOther sites of interest also include the Museum of Coins and Medals, the Museum of Skiing and a historical main square with a monumental Baroque plague column. The Gothic Church of St. Catherine hosts the popular European Organ Festival. A 20-km long aqueduct, built in the 15th century, is still working, supplying three hydroelectric power plants (one of them located 245 m below the ground). Forested mountains around the town offer plenty of opportunities for hiking and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe geographical centre of Europe is claimed to be in the nearby village of Krahule.\n\nKremnica has a population of 5,528 (as of December 31, 2013). According to the 2001 census, 95.8% of inhabitants were Slovaks and 1.2% Germans. However, even among those identifying themselves as Slovaks many are descendants of the Carpathian Germans, who played a very important role in the medieval history of the town. The religious makeup was 64.9% Roman Catholics, 22.6% people with no religious affiliation, and 5.8% Lutherans.\n\n\nKremnica is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

For definiteness, consider an amplitude modulated electromagnetic carrier wave. The phase velocity is the speed of the underlying carrier wave. The group velocity is the speed of the modulation or envelope. Initially it was thought that the group velocity coincided with the speed at which \"information\" traveled. However, it turns out that this speed can exceed the speed of light in some circumstances, causing confusion by an apparent conflict with the theory of relativity.

One possible form for a signal (at the point of emission) is:\n\nwhere \"u(t)\" is the Heaviside step function. Using such a form for a signal, it can be shown, subject to the (expected) condition that the refractive index of any medium tends to one as the frequency tends to infinity, that the wave discontinuity, called the \"front\", propagates at a speed less than or equal to the speed of light \"c\" in any medium. In fact, the earliest appearance of the front of an electromagnetic disturbance (the precursor) travels at the \"front velocity\", which is \"c\", \"no matter what the medium\".

The members of the class are Dirichlet series which obey four axioms that seem to capture the essential properties satisfied by most functions that are commonly called \"L\"-functions or zeta functions. Although the exact nature of the class is conjectural, the hope is that the definition of the class will lead to a classification of its contents and an elucidation of its properties, including insight into their relationship to automorphic forms and the Riemann hypothesis. The class was defined by Atle Selberg in , who preferred not to use the word \"axiom\" that later authors have employed.\n\nThe formal definition of the class \"S\" is the set of all Dirichlet series\n\nabsolutely convergent for Re(\"s\") > 1 that satisfy four axioms (or assumptions as Selberg calls them):\n\nand, for some θ < 1/2,\n\nThe condition that the real part of μ be non-negative is because there are known \"L\"-functions that do not satisfy the Riemann hypothesis when μ is negative. Specifically, there are Maass forms associated with exceptional eigenvalues, for which the Ramanujan–Peterssen conjecture holds, and have a functional equation, but do not satisfy the Riemann hypothesis.\n\nThe condition that θ < 1/2 is important, as the θ = 1/2 case includes the Dirichlet eta-function, which violates the Riemann hypothesis.\n\nIt is a consequence of 4. that the \"a\" are multiplicative and that\n\nThe prototypical example of an element in \"S\" is the Riemann zeta function.

{"id": "2200457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200457", "title": "Landau–Kleffner syndrome", "text": "Landau–Kleffner syndrome\n\nLandau–Kleffner syndrome (LKS)—also called infantile acquired aphasia, acquired epileptic aphasia or aphasia with convulsive disorder—is a rare childhood neurological syndrome.\n\nIt is named after William Landau and Frank Kleffner, who characterized it in 1957 with a diagnosis of six children.\n\nThe Landau–Kleffner syndrome is characterized by the sudden or gradual development of aphasia (the inability to understand or express language) and an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG). LKS affects the parts of the brain that control comprehension and speech (Broca's area and Wernicke's area). The disorder usually occurs in children between the ages of 3 and 7 years. There appears to be a male dominance in the diagnosis of the syndrome (ratio of 1.7:1, men to women).\n\nTypically, children with LKS develop normally, but then lose their language skills. While many affected individuals have clinical seizures, some only have electrographic seizures, including electrographic status epilepticus of sleep (ESES). The first indication of the language problem is usually auditory verbal agnosia. This is demonstrated in patients in multiple ways including the inability to recognize familiar noises and the impairment of the ability to lateralize or localize sound. In addition, receptive language is often critically impaired, however in some patients, impairment in expressive language is the most profound. In a study of 77 cases of Landau–Kleffner syndrome, 6 were found to have this type of aphasia. Because this syndrome appears during such a critical period of language acquisition in a child's life, speech production may be affected just as severely as language comprehension. The onset of LKS is typically between 18 months and 13 years, the most predominant time of emergence being between 3 and 7 years.\n\nGenerally, earlier manifestation of the disease correlates with poorer language recovery, and with the appearance of night seizures that last for longer than 36 months. LKS has a wide range of symptom differences and lacks a uniformity in diagnostic criteria between cases, and many studies don't include follow-ups on the patients, so no other relationships between symptoms and recovery have been made known.\n\nLanguage deterioration in patients typically occurs over a period of weeks or months. However, acute onset of the condition has also been reported as well as episodic aphasia.\n\nSeizures, especially during the night, are a heavily weighted indicator of LKS. The prevalence of clinical seizures in acquired epileptic aphasia (LKS) is 70-85%. In one third of patients, only a single episode of a seizure was recorded. The seizures typically appear between the ages of 4 and 10 and disappear before adulthood (around the age of 15).\n\nOften, behavioral and neuropsychologic disturbances accompany the progression of LKS. Behavioral issues are seen in as many as 78% of all cases. Hyperactivity and a decreased attention span are observed in as many as 80% of patients as well as rage, aggression, and anxiety. These behavior patterns are considered secondary to the language impairment in LKS. Impaired short-term memory is a feature recorded in long-standing cases of acquired epileptic aphasia.\n\nMost cases of LKS do not have a known cause. Occasionally, the condition may be induced secondary to other diagnoses, such as low-grade brain tumors, closed-head injuries, Neurocysticercosis, and Demyelinating Disease. Central Nervous System vasculitis may be associated with this condition as well.\n\nThe syndrome can be difficult to diagnose and may be misdiagnosed as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, hearing impairment, learning disability, auditory/verbal processing disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disability, childhood schizophrenia, or emotional/behavioral problems. An EEG (electroencephalogram) test is imperative to a diagnosis. Many cases of patients exhibiting LKS will show abnormal electrical brain activity in both the right and left hemispheres of the brain; this is exhibited frequently during sleep. Even though an abnormal EEG reading is common in LKS patients, a relationship has not been identified between EEG abnormalities and the presence and intensity of language problems. In many cases however, abnormalities in the EEG test has preceded language deterioration and improvement in the EEG tracing has preceded language improvement (this occurs in about half of all affected children). Many factors inhibit the reliability of the EEG data: neurologic deficits do not closely follow the maximal EEG changes in time.\n\nThe most effective way of confirming LKS is by obtaining overnight sleep EEGs, including EEGs in all stages of sleep. Many conditions like demyelination and brain tumors can be ruled out by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In LKS, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning can show decreased metabolism in one or both temporal lobes - hypermetabolism has been seen in patients with acquired epileptic aphasia.\n\nMost cases of LKS do not have a known cause. Occasionally, the condition may be induced secondary to other diagnoses such as low-grade brain tumors, closed-head injury, neurocysticercosis, and demyelinating disease. Central Nervous System vasculitis may be associated with this condition as well.\n\nThe table below demonstrates the extensive and differential diagnosis of acquired epileptic aphasia along with Cognitive and Behavioral Regression:\n\nNote: EEG = electroencephalographic; ESES = electrical status epilepticus of sleep; RL = receptive language; S = sociability\n\nTreatment for LKS usually consists of medications, such as anticonvulsants and corticosteroids (such as prednisone), and speech therapy, which should be started early. Some patients improve with the use of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) which lead researches to believe that inflammation and vasospasm may play a role in some cases of acquired epileptic aphasia.\n\nA controversial treatment option involves a surgical technique called multiple subpial transection in which multiple incisions are made through the cortex of the affected part of the brain beneath the pia mater, severing the axonal tracts in the subjacent white matter. The cortex is sliced in parallel lines to the midtemporal gyrus and perisylvian area to attenuate the spread of the epileptiform activity without causing cortical dysfunction. There is a study by Morrell \"et al.\" in which results were reported for 14 patients with acquired epileptic aphasia who underwent multiple subpial transections. Seven of the fourteen patients recovered age-appropriate speech and no longer required speech therapy. Another 4 of the 14 displayed improvement of speech and understanding instructions given verbally, but they still required speech therapy. Eleven patients had language dysfunction for two or more years. Another study by Sawhney \"et al.\" reported improvement in all three of their patients with acquired epileptic aphasia who underwent the same procedure.\n\nVarious hospitals contain programs designed to treat conditions such as LKS like the Children's Hospital Boston and its Augmentative Communication Program. It is known internationally for its work with children or adults who are non-speaking or severely impaired. Typically, a care team for children with LKS consists of a neurologist, a neuropsychologist, and a speech pathologist or audiologist. Some children with behavioral problems may also need to see a child psychologist and a psychopharmacologist. Speech therapy begins immediately at the time of diagnosis along with medical treatment that may include steroids and anti-epileptic or anti-convulsant medications.\nPatient education has also proved to be helpful in treating LKS. Teaching them sign language is a helpful means of communication and if the child was able to read and write before the onset of LKS, that is extremely helpful too.\n\nThe prognosis for children with LKS varies. Some affected children may have a permanent severe language disorder, while others may regain much of their language abilities (although it may take months or years). In some cases, remission and relapse may occur. The prognosis is improved when the onset of the disorder is after age 6 and when speech therapy is started early. Seizures generally disappear by adulthood. Short-term remissions are not uncommon in LKS but they create difficulties in evaluating a patient's response to various therapeutic modalities.\n\nThe following table demonstrate the Long-Term Follow-up of Acquired Epileptic Aphasia across many different instrumental studies:.\n\nLower rates of good outcomes have been reported, ranging between 14% to 50%. Duran \"et al.\" used 7 patients in his study (all males, aged 8–27 years of age) with LKS. On long-term followup, most of his patients did not demonstrate total epilepsy remission and language problems continued. Out of the seven patients, one reported a normal quality of life while the other six reported aphasia to be a substantial struggle. The Duran \"et al.\" study is one of few that features long-term follow up reports of LKS and utilizes EEG testing, MRIs, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the Connor's Rating Scales-revised, and a Short-Form Health Survey to analyze its patients.\n\nGlobally, more than 200 cases of acquired epileptic aphasia have been described in the literature. Between 1957 and 1980, 81 cases of acquired epileptic aphasia were reported, with 100 cases generally being diagnosed every 10 years.\n"}

It is described as a \"resuscitation technique\" in which through prolonged coughing and deep breathing every 2 seconds, a person suffering a cardiac dysrhythmia immediately before cardiac arrest can keep conscious until help arrives (or until the person can get to the nearest hospital). Neither the American Heart Association nor the American Red Cross endorses cough CPR during a heart attack.\n\nThis confusion appears to revolve primarily over the public's failure to discriminate between a heart attack, cardiac arrest and cardiac dysrhythmias. A heart attack occurs when an occlusion (e.g. blood clot) of an artery in the heart slowly causes tissue to die. This can result in chest pain and discomfort, and requires immediate medical attention to resolve the occlusion by emergency surgery or cardiac clot-busting drugs. A cardiac dysrhythmia is primarily an electrical problem within the heart, and is sometimes treated with electrolytes, vagal maneuver, or electrical cardioversion. Many dysrhythmias may herald an impending heart attack.\n\nHowever, before discarding 'Cough CPR' as a potential life-saving correction for dysrhythmia (aka afib [atrial fibrillation] or aflutter or supraventricular tachycardia), consider the benefits of the Valsalva vagal maneuver which have been shown to slow many types of sv tachycardia as noted in the two linked articles (both WebMD and NIH) below.\n\nCough CPR has been the subject of a series of chain email campaigns.

In the 13th century the region contained a community of Saxons, a Slovak fishing village, a Hungarian border post and a Carpathian German settlement. Its Latin name was first mentioned in 1251 as \"Villa (Saxonum apud Ecclesiam) Sancte Elisabeth\". In 1269 Kežmarok received its town charter. It also had the right to organize a cheese market (hence the German name \"Kesmark\" (\"Käsemarkt\" - \"cheese market\"). In 1433 the town was severely damaged by a Hussite raid. After 1440, the count of Spiš had a seat in Kežmarok. In the 15th century (and then once more in 1655), Kežmarok became a free royal town.\n\nThe town was a stronghold of the noble Thököly family. The Hungarian magnate and warrior Imre Thököly was born in the town in 1657. He died in exile in Turkey in 1705 but in the 20th century his body was returned to Kežmarok and he is buried in a noble mausoleum in the town's Lutheran church.\n\nThe town's other monuments include a castle, many Renaissance merchant houses, and a museum of ancient books. In pride of place is the Protestant church built in 1688 entirely of wood. The church also contains an organ of 1719 with wooden pipes. The church has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2008.\n\nKežmarok had an ethnic German majority until around 1910, and Germans stayed a large minority until the end of World War II. It also had a large and active Jewish community. During World War II, under the auspices of the First Slovak Republic, nearly 3,000 of the town's Jews were deported to German death camps. The town's pre-war Jewish cemetery has now been restored.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, the town had 17,383 inhabitants. 95.21% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.59% Roma, 0.83% Czechs and 0.43% Germans.

He was Archbishop of Dubuque from 1962 to 1983, having previously served as Auxiliary Bishop of St. Paul (1947–56) and Bishop of Boise (1956–62).\n\nJames Byrne was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, to Philip Joseph and Mary Agnes (née McMonigal) Вyrne. One of nine children, he had five brothers and three sisters; one of his brothers, Thomas R. Byrne, served as Mayor of St. Paul from 1966 to 1970. Another brother, Robert Byrne, was an instructor of Latin at Saint Thomas Military Academy. After graduating from parochial school, he attended Cretin High School in St. Paul.\n\nByrne enrolled at Nazareth Hall Preparatory Seminary in 1924. In 1927, he continued his studies for the priesthood at St. Paul Seminary. He earned a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. in 1933.\n\nOn June 3, 1933, Byrne was ordained a priest by Archbishop John Gregory Murray at St. Paul Cathedral. His first assignment was as a curate at St. Peter's Church in Mendota. He continued his studies at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, where he earned a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree in 1937 with a thesis entitled: \"\"Idea of Development of Doctrine in Anglican Writings of John Henry Newman.\"\"\n\nFollowing his return to Minnesota, Byrne served as professor of philosophy and theology (1937–45) and academic dean (1941–45) at the College of St. Thomas. He was also a part-time professor of theology at the College of St. Catherine (1940–47) and a professor of theology at St. Paul Seminary (1945–47). In addition to his academic duties, he served as a chaplain at local religious institutions.\n\nOn May 10, 1947, Byrne was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and titular bishop of \"Etenna\" by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following July 2 from Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, with Bishops Thomas Anthony Welch and Francis Joseph Schenk serving as co-consecrators, at St. Paul Cathedral. He selected as his episcopal motto: \"Ad Jesum Per Mariam\" (Latin: \"To Jesus through Mary\").\nAs an auxiliary bishop, Byrne served as pastor of the Church of the Nativity in St. Paul (1948–56).\n\nFollowing the death of Bishop Edward Kelly, Byrne was appointed the fourth Bishop of Boise, Idaho, on June 16, 1956. His installation took place at Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist on August 29 of that year. He remained in Boise for nearly six years.\n\nFollowing the appointment of Archbishop Leo Binz to the Archdiocese of Saint Paul, Pope John XXIII named Byrne the ninth bishop and seventh archbishop of Dubuque on March 7, 1962. He was installed as archbishop by the Apostolic Delegate on May 8, 1962, in St. Raphael's Cathedral. Archbishop Byrne would serve as the leader of the Dubuque Archdiocese for 21 years.\n\nFrom 1962-1965, Byrne was present at all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. Following the council he was responsible for implementing the reforms promulgated by the council within the archdiocese. During his time in office, Archbishop Byrne maintained a relatively low profile in the community. He was noted for asking that Catholics join him in a televised recitation of the Rosary before the evening news, and had cards produced that people could place on top of their television sets. Archbishop Byrne also encouraged the growing cooperation among the Roman Catholic and Protestant seminaries and colleges in Dubuque and often accepted invitations to participate in seminars and to speak to classes. On one occasion, in an airport, he encountered a Protestant seminarian he had come to know through these activities who was going to interview for a parish position and offered his blessing for his success and for his future ministry. He also devoted as much time as he could to visiting those who were hospitalized in Dubuque.\n\nIn 1966 the archdiocese was one the nation's first dioceses to establish a Priests' Senate. The following year the Archdiocesan Board of Education was established, and adult education was started at the parish level. The Priest Personnel Board was established in 1968 to advise the archbishop on priest assignments in the archdiocese. In 1970 an Interim Pastoral Council was developed as an advisory and consultative group. Villa Raphael was opened in 1971 as a home for retired priests. On October 4, 1979, Pope John Paul II made his historic visit to Iowa with Archbishop Byrne serving as his official host in his role as \"Primate of Iowa.\" Byrne was also Chancellor of Loras College.\n\nPope John Paul II accepted Byrne's resignation on August 23, 1983, and he was named Archbishop Emeritus of Dubuque. Following his retirement, Byrne remained in the Dubuque area. He died while a resident at the Stonehill Care Center (operated by Franciscan Sisters) in Dubuque on August 2, 1996, and was buried in the mortuary chapel of St. Raphael's Cathedral along with other deceased bishops and archbishops of the archdiocese. Archbishop Byrne had earlier purchased a simple wooden casket from the monks of New Melleray Abbey and stored it at the Cathedral; this was the casket in which he was buried.\n\n"}

Baščaršija was built in the 15th century when Isa-Beg Isaković founded the city.\n\nBaščaršija is located on the north bank of the river Miljacka, in the municipality of Stari Grad. On Baščaršija there are several important historic buildings, such as the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque and sahat-kula. Today Baščaršija is the major tourist attraction of Sarajevo.\n\nThe word Baščaršija derives from the Turkish language. The word \"baš\" which is \"baş\" in Turkish literally means \"head\", in some contexts however also \"primary\", \"main\", \"capital\" and \"čaršija\" which is \"çarşı\" in Turkish means \"bazaar\" or \"market\".\n\nThe suffix 'ja' (modern Turkish: '(y)a') means 'to' in Turkish, meaning the full name of the district translates to 'to the main bazaar' in Turkish. However, it is more likely that the ending -ija is a Bosnianism, as many Turkish loanwords have the same ending to conform to Bosnian grammatical rules. In the nominative case, the place has always been referred to in Turkish as \"Başçarşı\" only, without \"ya\".\n\nBefore the arrival of the Ottomans in the largest settlement on Sarajevo field was the village square Tornik, which was located at the crossroad of the roads where today is the Ali Pasha's Mosque. Baščaršija was built in 1462 when Isa-Beg Isaković built the Ishaković han, in addition to its many shops.\n\nAround the main entrance, the Bazerdžani čaršija was formed. The čaršija Kazaz is situated to the west, and to the north sit both the čaršija Sedlar and Sarača. The most significant buildings constructed during this period were mosques. Baščaršija's famous mosque was built by Havedža Durak in 1528, and Gazi Husrev-beg built his mosque in 1530.\n\nGazi Husrev-Beg raises a madrassa, a library, a haniqah, the Gazi Husrev-Beg Hamam, the Gazi Husrev-Beg bezistan, the Morića Han, sahat-kula and other tourist attractions in Baščaršija. Gazi Husrev-Beg was buried in the harem of his mosque, beside the harem is the Türbe of his freed slave and the first mutevelija of his vakuf, Murat-beg Tardić.\n\nAlong with Islamic places of worship erected at that time, Baščaršija is also the location of the Old Orthodox Church, built sometimes during 16th century and first mentioned in Ottoman sources from 1539, and also the first Sephardi temple, called Old Synagogue which is built between 1581-87. Just next to the Old Synagogue ( = Old Temple) some time later was built New Synagogue ( = New Temple).\n\nToday the Jewish community uses the more recently erected synagogue just across the Miljacka river, while both Old and New synagogue buildings are used as Jewish cultural centers. The New Synagogue was donated by the Jewish community to the city of Sarajevo and serves as a gallery called Novi Hram. The Old Synagogue building was turned into the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is considered to be one of the finest exhibition spaces in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nDuring the 16th century a number of commercial facilities was built, such as bezistans, hans, and caravanserais. Sarajevo was an important center of trade in the Balkans and had three bezistans (today the Gazi Husrev-Beg and Brusa bezistans are still standing). There were colonies of Venetian and Ragusan traders, and Baščaršija had approximately 12,000 commercial and craft shops. \n\nAfter the earthquake in 1640 and several fires in 1644 and 1656, Sarajevo was 1697 burned and devastated by the troops of Prince Eugene of Savoy. \nTravel writer Evliya Çelebi wrote:\n\nThe city of Sarajevo didn't expand significantly until the 19th century. With the Austro-Hungarian occupation in 1878, foreign architects wanted to re-build Sarajevo into a modern European city. A fire contributed to this process, destroying parts of the Stari Grad.\n\nDuring the anti-Serb riots of Sarajevo in June 1914, violent mobs looted and vandalized several Serb-owned shops in Baščaršija as well as other parts of the city.\nWith the liberation of Sarajevo in 1945 after the Second World War, a committee decided that the market should be gradually demolished, believing that it had no role in a modern city. However, the plans were cancelled, and the buildings were left standing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2200527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200527", "title": "Apartheid", "text": "Apartheid\n\nApartheid (South African English: ; , segregation; lit. \"aparthood\") was a system of institutionalised racial segregation that existed in South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia) from 1948 until the early 1990s. Apartheid was characterised by an authoritarian political culture based on \"baasskap\" (or white supremacy), which ensured that South Africa was dominated politically, socially, and economically by the nation's minority white population. According to this system of social stratification, white citizens had the highest status, followed in descending order by Asians, Coloureds, and black Africans. The economic legacy and social effects of apartheid continue to the present day.\n\nBroadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into \"petty apartheid\", which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and \"grand apartheid\", which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some aspects of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white South Africans and the socially enforced separation of black Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment. Apartheid was adopted as a formal policy by the South African government after the ascension of the National Party (NP) during the 1948 general elections.\n\nA codified system of racial stratification began to take form in South Africa under the Dutch Empire in the eighteenth century, although informal segregation was present much earlier due to social cleavages between Dutch colonists and a creolised, ethnically diverse slave population. With the rapid growth and industrialisation of the British Cape Colony in the nineteenth century, racial policies and laws became increasingly rigid. Cape legislation that discriminated specifically against black Africans began appearing shortly before 1900. The policies of the Boer republics were also racially exclusive; for instance, the Transvaal's constitution barred black African and Coloured participation in church and state.\n\nThe first apartheid law was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949, followed closely by the Immorality Amendment Act of 1950, which made it illegal for most South African citizens to marry or pursue sexual relationships across racial lines. The Population Registration Act, 1950 classified all South Africans into one of four racial groups based on appearance, known ancestry, socioeconomic status, and cultural lifestyle: \"Black\", \"White\", \"Coloured\", and \"Indian\", the last two of which included several sub-classifications. Places of residence were determined by racial classification. Between 1960 and 1983, 3.5 million black Africans were removed from their homes and forced into segregated neighbourhoods as a result of apartheid legislation, in some of the largest mass evictions in modern history. Most of these targeted removals were intended to restrict the black population to ten designated \"tribal homelands\", also known as \"bantustans\", four of which became nominally independent states. The government announced that relocated persons would lose their South African citizenship as they were absorbed into the bantustans.\n\nApartheid sparked significant international and domestic opposition, resulting in some of the most influential global social movements of the twentieth century. It was the target of frequent condemnation in the United Nations and brought about an extensive arms and trade embargo on South Africa. During the 1970s and 1980s, internal resistance to apartheid became increasingly militant, prompting brutal crackdowns by the National Party government and protracted sectarian violence that left thousands dead or in detention. Some reforms of the apartheid system were undertaken, including allowing for Indian and Coloured political representation in parliament, but these measures failed to appease most activist groups.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1993, the National Party entered into bilateral negotiations with the African National Congress (ANC), the leading anti-apartheid political movement, for ending segregation and introducing majority rule. In 1990, prominent ANC figures such as Nelson Mandela were released from prison. Apartheid legislation was repealed on 17 June 1991, pending multiracial elections held under a universal suffrage set for April 1994.\n\n\"Apartheid\" is an Afrikaans word meaning \"separateness\", or \"the state of being apart\", literally \"apart-hood\" (from Afrikaans \"-heid\"). Its first recorded use was in 1929.\n\nUnder the 1806 Cape Articles of Capitulation the new British colonial rulers were required to respect previous legislation enacted under Roman Dutch law and this led to a separation of the law in South Africa from English Common Law and a high degree of legislative autonomy. The governors and assemblies that governed the legal process in the various colonies of South Africa were launched on a different and independent legislative path from the rest of the British Empire.\n\nIn the days of slavery, slaves required passes to travel away from their masters. In 1797 the Landdrost and Heemraden of Swellendam and Graaff-Reinet extended pass laws beyond slaves and ordained that all Khoikhoi (designated as \"Hottentots\") moving about the country for any purpose should carry passes. This was confirmed by the British Colonial government in 1809 by the Hottentot Proclamation, which decreed that if a Khoikhoi were to move they would need a pass from their master or a local official. Ordinance No. 49 of 1828 decreed that prospective black immigrants were to be granted passes for the sole purpose of seeking work. These passes were to be issued for Coloureds and Khoikhoi, but not for other Africans, who were still forced to carry passes.\n\nThe United Kingdom's Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (3 & 4 Will. IV c. 73) abolished slavery throughout the British Empire and overrode the Cape Articles of Capitulation. To comply with the act the South African legislation was expanded to include Ordinance 1 in 1835, which effectively changed the status of slaves to indentured labourers. This was followed by Ordinance 3 in 1848, which introduced an indenture system for Xhosa that was little different from slavery. The various South African colonies passed legislation throughout the rest of the nineteenth century to limit the freedom of unskilled workers, to increase the restrictions on indentured workers and to regulate the relations between the races.\n\nThe Franchise and Ballot Act of 1892 instituted limits based on financial means and education to the black franchise, and the Natal Legislative Assembly Bill of 1894 deprived Indians of the right to vote. The Glen Grey Act of 1894, instigated by the government of Prime Minister Cecil John Rhodes limited the amount of land Africans could hold. In 1905 the General Pass Regulations Act denied blacks the vote, limited them to fixed areas and inaugurated the infamous Pass System. \n\nThe Asiatic Registration Act (1906) required all Indians to register and carry passes. In 1910, the Union of South Africa was created as a self-governing dominion, which continued the legislative programme: the South Africa Act (1910) enfranchised whites, giving them complete political control over all other racial groups while removing the right of blacks to sit in parliament, the Native Land Act (1913) prevented blacks, except those in the Cape, from buying land outside \"reserves\", the Natives in Urban Areas Bill (1918) was designed to force blacks into \"locations\", the Urban Areas Act (1923) introduced residential segregation and provided cheap labour for industry led by white people, the Colour Bar Act (1926) prevented black mine workers from practising skilled trades, the Native Administration Act (1927) made the British Crown, rather than paramount chiefs, the supreme head over all African affairs, the Native Land and Trust Act (1936) complemented the 1913 Native Land Act and, in the same year, the Representation of Natives Act removed previous black voters from the Cape voters' roll and allowed them to elect three whites to Parliament. One of the first pieces of segregating legislation enacted by Jan Smuts' United Party government was the Asiatic Land Tenure Bill (1946), which banned land sales to Indians.\n\nThe United Party government began to move away from the rigid enforcement of segregationist laws during World War II. Amid fears integration would eventually lead to racial assimilation, the National Party established the Sauer Commission to investigate the effects of the United Party's policies. The commission concluded that integration would bring about a \"loss of personality\" for all racial groups.\n\nSouth Africa had allowed social custom and law to govern the consideration of multiracial affairs and of the allocation, in racial terms, of access to economic, social, and political status. Most white South Africans, regardless of their own differences, accepted the prevailing pattern. Nevertheless, by 1948 it remained apparent that there were gaps in the social structure, whether legislated or otherwise, concerning the rights and opportunities of nonwhites. The rapid economic development of World War II attracted black migrant workers in large numbers to chief industrial centres, where they compensated for the wartime shortage of white labour. However, this escalated rate of black urbanisation went unrecognised by the South African government, which failed to accommodate the influx with parallel expansion in housing or social services. Overcrowding, increasing crime rates, and disillusionment resulted; urban blacks came to support a new generation of leaders influenced by the principles of self-determination and popular freedoms enshrined in such statements as the Atlantic Charter. Whites reacted negatively to the changes, allowing the Herenigde Nasionale Party (or simply the National Party) to convince a large segment of the voting bloc that the impotence of the United Party in curtailing the evolving position of nonwhites indicated that the organisation had fallen under the influence of Western liberals. Many Afrikaners, white South Africans chiefly of Dutch descent but with early infusions of Germans and French Huguenots who were soon assimilated, also resented what they perceived as disempowerment by an underpaid black workforce and the superior economic power and prosperity of white English speakers. In addition, Jan Smuts, as a strong advocate of the United Nations, lost domestic support when South Africa was criticised for its colour bar and the continued mandate of South West Africa by other UN member states.\n\nAfrikaner nationalists proclaimed that they offered the voters a new policy to ensure continued white domination. This policy was initially expounded from a theory drafted by Hendrik Verwoerd and was presented to the National Party by the Sauer Commission. It called for a systematic effort to organise the relations, rights, and privileges of the races as officially defined through a series of parliamentary acts and administrative decrees. Segregation had thus been pursued only in major matters, such as separate schools, and local society rather than law had been depended upon to enforce most separation; it should now be extended to everything. The party gave this policy a name\"apartheid\" (apartness). Apartheid was to be the basic ideological and practical foundation of Afrikaner politics for the next quarter of a century.\n\nThe National Party's election platform stressed that apartheid would preserve a market for white employment in which nonwhites could not compete. On the issues of black urbanisation, the regulation of nonwhite labour, influx control, social security, farm tariffs, and nonwhite taxation the United Party's policy remained contradictory and confused. Its traditional bases of support not only took mutually exclusive positions, but found themselves increasingly at odds with each other. Smuts' reluctance to consider South African foreign policy against the mounting tensions of the Cold War also stirred up discontent, while the nationalists promised to purge the state and public service of communist sympathisers.\n\nFirst to desert the United Party were Afrikaner farmers, who wished to see a change in influx control due to problems with squatters, as well as higher prices for their maize and other produce in the face of the mineowners' demand for cheap food policies. Always identified with the affluent and capitalist, the party also failed to appeal to its working class constituents. Populist rhetoric allowed the National Party to sweep eight constituencies in the mining and industrial centres of the Witwatersrand and five more in Pretoria. Barring the predominantly English-speaking landowner electorate of the Natal, the United Party was defeated in almost every rural district. Its urban losses in the nation's most populous province, the Transvaal, proved equally devastating. As the voting system was disproportionately weighted in favour of rural constituencies and the Transvaal in particular, the 1948 election catapulted the Herenigde Nasionale Party from a small minority party to a commanding position with an eight-vote parliamentary lead. Daniel François Malan became the first nationalist prime minister, with the aim of implementing the apartheid philosophy and silencing liberal opposition.\n\nWhen the National Party came to power in 1948, there were factional differences in the party about the implementation of systemic racial segregation. The \"baasskap\" (white domination or supremacist) faction, which was the dominant faction in the NP, and state institutions, favoured systematic segregation, but also favoured the participation of black Africans in the economy with black labour controlled to advance the economic gains of Afrikaners. A second faction were the \"purists\", who believed in \"vertical segregation\", in which blacks and whites would be entirely separated, with blacks living in native reserves, with separate political and economic structures, which, they believed, would entail severe short-term pain, but would also lead to independence of white South Africa from black labour in the long-term. A third faction, which included Hendrik Verwoerd, sympathised with the purists, but allowed for the use of black labour, while implementing the purist goal of vertical separation.\n\nNP leaders argued that South Africa did not comprise a single nation, but was made up of four distinct racial groups: white, black, Coloured and Indian. Such groups were split into 13 nations or racial federations. White people encompassed the English and Afrikaans language groups; the black populace was divided into ten such groups.\n\nThe state passed laws that paved the way for \"grand apartheid\", which was centred on separating races on a large scale, by compelling people to live in separate places defined by race. This strategy was in part adopted from \"left-over\" British rule that separated different racial groups after they took control of the Boer republics in the Anglo-Boer war. This created the black-only \"townships\" or \"locations\", where blacks were relocated to their own towns. In addition, \"petty apartheid\" laws were passed. The principal apartheid laws were as follows.\n\nThe first grand apartheid law was the Population Registration Act of 1950, which formalised racial classification and introduced an identity card for all persons over the age of 18, specifying their racial group. Official teams or boards were established to come to a conclusion on those people whose race was unclear. This caused difficulty, especially for Coloured people, separating their families when members were allocated different races.\n\nThe second pillar of grand apartheid was the Group Areas Act of 1950. Until then, most settlements had people of different races living side by side. This Act put an end to diverse areas and determined where one lived according to race. Each race was allotted its own area, which was used in later years as a basis of forced removal. The Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act of 1951 allowed the government to demolish black shanty town slums and forced white employers to pay for the construction of housing for those black workers who were permitted to reside in cities otherwise reserved for whites.\n\nThe Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 prohibited marriage between persons of different races, and the Immorality Act of 1950 made sexual relations with a person of a different race a criminal offence.\n\nUnder the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act of 1953, municipal grounds could be reserved for a particular race, creating, among other things, separate beaches, buses, hospitals, schools and universities. Signboards such as \"whites only\" applied to public areas, even including park benches. Black South Africans were provided with services greatly inferior to those of whites, and, to a lesser extent, to those of Indian and Coloured people.\n\nFurther laws had the aim of suppressing resistance, especially armed resistance, to apartheid. The Suppression of Communism Act of 1950 banned any party subscribing to Communism. The act defined Communism and its aims so sweepingly that anyone who opposed government policy risked being labelled as a Communist. Since the law specifically stated that Communism aimed to disrupt racial harmony, it was frequently used to gag opposition to apartheid. Disorderly gatherings were banned, as were certain organisations that were deemed threatening to the government.\n\nThe Bantu Authorities Act of 1951 created separate government structures for blacks and whites and was the first piece of legislation to support the government's plan of separate development in the bantustans. The Promotion of Black Self-Government Act of 1959 entrenched the NP policy of nominally independent \"homelands\" for blacks. So-called \"self–governing Bantu units\" were proposed, which would have devolved administrative powers, with the promise later of autonomy and self-government. It also abolished the seats of white representatives of black South Africans and removed from the rolls the few blacks still qualified to vote. The Bantu Investment Corporation Act of 1959 set up a mechanism to transfer capital to the homelands to create employment there. Legislation of 1967 allowed the government to stop industrial development in \"white\" cities and redirect such development to the \"homelands\". The Black Homeland Citizenship Act of 1970 marked a new phase in the Bantustan strategy. It changed the status of blacks to citizens of one of the ten autonomous territories. The aim was to ensure a demographic majority of white people within South Africa by having all ten Bantustans achieve full independence.\n\nInterracial contact in sport was frowned upon, but there were no segregatory sports laws.\n\nThe government tightened pass laws compelling blacks to carry identity documents, to prevent the immigration of blacks from other countries. To reside in a city, blacks had to be in employment there. Until 1956 women were for the most part excluded from these \"pass\" requirements, as attempts to introduce \"pass laws\" for women were met with fierce resistance.\n\nIn 1950, D. F. Malan announced the NP's intention to create a Coloured Affairs Department. J.G. Strijdom, Malan's successor as Prime Minister, moved to strip voting rights from black and Coloured residents of the Cape Province. The previous government had introduced the Separate Representation of Voters Bill into Parliament in 1951; however, four voters, G Harris, W D Franklin, W D Collins and Edgar Deane, challenged its validity in court with support from the United Party. The Cape Supreme Court upheld the act, but reversed by the Appeal Court, finding the act invalid because a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament was needed to change the entrenched clauses of the Constitution. The government then introduced the High Court of Parliament Bill (1952), which gave Parliament the power to overrule decisions of the court. The Cape Supreme Court and the Appeal Court declared this invalid too.\n\nIn 1955 the Strijdom government increased the number of judges in the Appeal Court from five to 11, and appointed pro-Nationalist judges to fill the new places. In the same year they introduced the Senate Act, which increased the Senate from 49 seats to 89. Adjustments were made such that the NP controlled 77 of these seats. The parliament met in a joint sitting and passed the Separate Representation of Voters Act in 1956, which transferred Coloured voters from the common voters' roll in the Cape to a new Coloured voters' roll. Immediately after the vote, the Senate was restored to its original size. The Senate Act was contested in the Supreme Court, but the recently enlarged Appeal Court, packed with government-supporting judges, upheld the act, and also the Act to remove Coloured voters.\n\nThe 1956 law allowed Coloureds to elect four people to Parliament, but a 1969 law abolished those seats and stripped Coloureds of their right to vote. Since Asians had never been allowed to vote, this resulted in whites being the sole enfranchised group.\n\nA 2016 study in the Journal of Politics suggests that disenfranchisement in South Africa had a significant negative impact on basic service delivery to the disenfranchised.\n\nBefore South Africa became a republic in 1961, politics among white South Africans was typified by the division between the mainly Afrikaner pro-republic conservative and the largely English anti-republican liberal sentiments, with the legacy of the Boer War still a factor for some people. Once South Africa became a republic, Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd called for improved relations and greater accord between people of British descent and the Afrikaners. He claimed that the only difference was between those in favour of apartheid and those against it. The ethnic division would no longer be between Afrikaans and English speakers, but between blacks and whites.\n\nMost Afrikaners supported the notion of unanimity of white people to ensure their safety. White voters of British descent were divided. Many had opposed a republic, leading to a majority \"no\" vote in Natal. Later, some of them recognised the perceived need for white unity, convinced by the growing trend of decolonisation elsewhere in Africa, which concerned them. British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's \"Wind of Change\" speech left the British faction feeling that the United Kingdom had abandoned them. The more conservative English speakers supported Verwoerd; others were troubled by the severing of ties with the UK and remained loyal to the Crown. They were displeased by having to choose between British and South African nationalities. Although Verwoerd tried to bond these different blocs, the subsequent voting illustrated only a minor swell of support, indicating that a great many English speakers remained apathetic and that Verwoerd had not succeeded in uniting the white population.\n\nUnder the homeland system, the government attempted to divide South Africa and South West Africa into a number of separate states, each of which was supposed to develop into a separate nation-state for a different ethnic group.\n\nTerritorial separation was hardly a new institution. There were, for example, the \"reserves\" created under the British government in the nineteenth century. Under apartheid, 13 percent of the land was reserved for black homelands, a small amount relative to its total population, and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country. The Tomlinson Commission of 1954 justified apartheid and the homeland system, but stated that additional land ought to be given to the homelands, a recommendation that was not carried out.\n\nWhen Verwoerd became Prime Minister in 1958, the policy of \"separate development\" came into being, with the homeland structure as one of its cornerstones. Verwoerd came to believe in the granting of independence to these homelands. The government justified its plans on the ostensible basis that \"(the) government's policy is, therefore, not a policy of discrimination on the grounds of race or colour, but a policy of differentiation on the ground of nationhood, of different nations, granting to each self-determination within the borders of their homelandshence this policy of separate development\". Under the homelands system, blacks would no longer be citizens of South Africa, becoming citizens of the independent homelands who worked in South Africa as foreign migrant labourers on temporary work permits. In 1958 the Promotion of Black Self-Government Act was passed, and border industries and the Bantu Investment Corporation were established to promote economic development and the provision of employment in or near the homelands. Many black South Africans who had never resided in their identified homeland were forcibly removed from the cities to the homelands.\n\nThe vision of a South Africa divided into multiple ethno-states appealed to the reform-minded Afrikaner intelligensia, and it provided a more coherent philosophical and moral framework for the National Party's policies, while also providing a veneer of intellectual respectability to the controversial policy of so-called baasskap.\nIn total, 20 homelands were allocated to an ethnic groups, ten in South Africa proper and ten in South West Africa. Of these 20 homelands, 19 were classified as black, while one, Basterland, was set aside for a sub-group of Coloureds known as Basters, who are closely related to Afrikaners. Four of the homelands were declared independent by the South African government: Transkei in 1976, Bophuthatswana in 1977, Venda in 1979, and Ciskei in 1981 (known as the TBVC states). Once a homeland was granted its nominal independence, its designated citizens had their South African citizenship revoked and replaced with citizenship in their homeland. These people were then issued passports instead of passbooks. Citizens of the nominally autonomous homelands also had their South African citizenship circumscribed, meaning they were no longer legally considered South African. The South African government attempted to draw an equivalence between their view of black citizens of the homelands and the problems which other countries faced through entry of illegal immigrants.\n\nBantustans within the borders of South Africa and South West Africa were classified by degree of nominal self-rule: 6 were \"non-self-governing\", 10 were \"self-governing\", and 4 were \"independent\". In theory, self-governing Bantustans had control over many aspects of their internal functioning but were not yet sovereign nations. Independent Bantustans (Transkei, Bophutatswana, Venda and Ciskei; also known as the TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. In reality, they had no significant economic infrastructure and with few exceptions encompassed swaths of disconnected territory. This meant all the Bantustans were little more than puppet states controlled by South Africa.\n\nThroughout the existence of the independent Bantustans, South Africa remained the only country to recognise their independence. Nevertheless, internal organisations of many countries, as well as the South African government, lobbied for their recognition. For example, upon the foundation of Transkei, the Swiss-South African Association encouraged the Swiss government to recognise the new state. In 1976, leading up to a United States House of Representatives resolution urging the President to not recognise Transkei, the South African government intensely lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill. Each TBVC state extended recognition to the other independent Bantustans while South Africa showed its commitment to the notion of TBVC sovereignty by building embassies in the TBVC capitals.\n\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, the government implemented a policy of \"resettlement\", to force people to move to their designated \"group areas\". Millions of people were forced to relocate. These removals included people relocated due to slum clearance programmes, labour tenants on white-owned farms, the inhabitants of the so-called \"black spots\" (black-owned land surrounded by white farms), the families of workers living in townships close to the homelands, and \"surplus people\" from urban areas, including thousands of people from the Western Cape (which was declared a \"Coloured Labour Preference Area\") who were moved to the Transkei and Ciskei homelands. The best-publicised forced removals of the 1950s occurred in Johannesburg, when 60,000 people were moved to the new township of Soweto (an abbreviation for South Western Townships).\n\nUntil 1955, Sophiatown had been one of the few urban areas where black people were allowed to own land, and was slowly developing into a multiracial slum. As industry in Johannesburg grew, Sophiatown became the home of a rapidly expanding black workforce, as it was convenient and close to town. It had the only swimming pool for black children in Johannesburg. As one of the oldest black settlements in Johannesburg, it held an almost symbolic importance for the 50,000 black people it contained. Despite a vigorous ANC protest campaign and worldwide publicity, the removal of Sophiatown began on 9 February 1955 under the Western Areas Removal Scheme. In the early hours, heavily armed police forced residents out of their homes and loaded their belongings onto government trucks. The residents were taken to a large tract of land from the city centre, known as Meadowlands, which the government had purchased in 1953. Meadowlands became part of a new planned black city called Soweto. Sophiatown was destroyed by bulldozers, and a new white suburb named Triomf (Triumph) was built in its place. This pattern of forced removal and destruction was to repeat itself over the next few years, and was not limited to black South Africans alone. Forced removals from areas like Cato Manor (Mkhumbane) in Durban, and District Six in Cape Town, where 55,000 Coloured and Indian people were forced to move to new townships on the Cape Flats, were carried out under the Group Areas Act of 1950. Nearly 600,000 Coloured, Indian and Chinese people were moved under the Group Areas Act. Some 40,000 whites were also forced to move when land was transferred from \"white South Africa\" into the black homelands.\n\nThe NP passed a string of legislation that became known as \"petty apartheid\". The first of these was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act 55 of 1949, prohibiting marriage between whites and people of other races. The Immorality Amendment Act 21 of 1950 (as amended in 1957 by Act 23) forbade \"unlawful racial intercourse\" and \"any immoral or indecent act\" between a white and a black, Indian or Coloured person.\n\nBlacks were not allowed to run businesses or professional practices in areas designated as \"white South Africa\" unless they had a permit - such being granted only exceptionally. They were required to move to the black \"homelands\" and set up businesses and practices there. Trains, hospitals and ambulances were segregated. Because of the smaller numbers of white patients and the fact that white doctors preferred to work in white hospitals, conditions in white hospitals were much better than those in often overcrowded and understaffed, significantly underfunded black hospitals. Residential areas were segregated and blacks were allowed to live in white areas only if employed as a servant and even then only in servants’ quarters. Blacks were excluded from working in white areas, unless they had a pass, nicknamed the \"dompas\", also spelt \"dompass\" or \"dom pass\". The most likely origin of this name is from the Afrikaans \"verdomde pas\" (meaning accursed pass), although some commentators ascribe it to the Afrikaans words meaning \"dumb pass\". Only blacks with \"Section 10\" rights (those who had migrated to the cities before World War II) were excluded from this provision. A pass was issued only to a black with approved work. Spouses and children had to be left behind in black homelands. A pass was issued for one magisterial district (usually one town) confining the holder to that area only. Being without a valid pass made a person subject to arrest and trial for being an illegal migrant. This was often followed by deportation to the person's homeland and prosecution of the employer for employing an illegal migrant. Police vans patrolled white areas to round up blacks without passes. Blacks were not allowed to employ whites in white South Africa.\n\nAlthough trade unions for black and Coloured workers had existed since the early 20th century, it was not until the 1980s reforms that a mass black trade union movement developed. Trade unions under apartheid were racially segregated, with 54 unions being white only, 38 for Indian and Coloured and 19 for black people. The Industrial Conciliation Act (1956) legislated against the creation of multi-racial trade unions and attempted to split existing multi-racial unions into separate branches or organisations along racial lines.\n\nEach black homeland controlled its own education, health and police systems. Blacks were not allowed to buy hard liquor. They were able to buy only state-produced poor quality beer (although this law was relaxed later). Public beaches, swimming pools, some pedestrian bridges, drive-in cinema parking spaces, graveyards, parks, and public toilets were segregated. Cinemas and theatres in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks. There were practically no cinemas in black areas. Most restaurants and hotels in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks except as staff. Blacks were prohibited from attending white churches under the Churches Native Laws Amendment Act of 1957, but this was never rigidly enforced, and churches were one of the few places races could mix without the interference of the law. Blacks earning 360 rand a year or more had to pay taxes while the white threshold was more than twice as high, at 750 rand a year. On the other hand, the taxation rate for whites was considerably higher than that for blacks.\n\nBlacks could never acquire land in white areas. In the homelands, much of the land belonged to a \"tribe\", where the local chieftain would decide how the land had to be used. This resulted in whites owning almost all the industrial and agricultural lands and much of the prized residential land. Most blacks were stripped of their South African citizenship when the \"homelands\" became \"independent\", and they were no longer able to apply for South African passports. Eligibility requirements for a passport had been difficult for blacks to meet, the government contending that a passport was a privilege, not a right, and the government did not grant many passports to blacks. Apartheid pervaded culture as well as the law, and was entrenched by most of the mainstream media.\n\nThe population was classified into four groups: African, White, Indian and Coloured (capitalised to denote their legal definitions in South African law). The Coloured group included people regarded as being of mixed descent, including of Bantu, Khoisan, European and Malay ancestry. Many were descended from people brought to South Africa from other parts of the world, such as India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar and China as slaves and indentured workers.\n\nThe Population Registration Act, (Act 30 of 1950), defined South Africans as belonging to one of three races: White, Black or Coloured. People of Indian ancestry were considered Coloured under this act. Appearance, social acceptance and descent were used to determine the qualification of an individual into one of the three categories. A white person was described by the act as one whose parents were both white and possessed the \"habits, speech, education, deportment and demeanour\" of a white person. Blacks were defined by the act as belonging to an African race or tribe. Lastly, Coloureds were those who could not be classified as black or white.\n\nThe apartheid bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria at the time that the Population Registration Act was implemented to determine who was Coloured. Minor officials would administer tests to determine if someone should be categorised either Coloured or White, or if another person should be categorised either Coloured or Black. The tests included the pencil test, in which a pencil was shoved into the subjects’ curly hair and the subjects made to shake their head. If the pencil stuck they were deemed to be Black; if dislodged they were pronounced Coloured. Other tests involved examining the shapes of jaw lines and buttocks and pinching people to see what language they would say \"Ouch\" in. As a result of these tests, different members of the same family found themselves in different race groups. Further tests determined membership of the various sub-racial groups of the Coloureds.\n\nDiscriminated against by apartheid, Coloureds were as a matter of state policy forced to live in separate townships, as defined in the Group Areas Act (1950), in some cases leaving homes their families had occupied for generations, and received an inferior education, though better than that provided to Africans. They played an important role in the anti-apartheid movement: for example the African Political Organization established in 1902 had an exclusively Coloured membership.\n\nVoting rights were denied to Coloureds in the same way that they were denied to Blacks from 1950 to 1983. However, in 1977 the NP caucus approved proposals to bring Coloureds and Indians into central government. In 1982, final constitutional proposals produced a referendum among Whites, and the Tricameral Parliament was approved. The Constitution was reformed the following year to allow the Coloured and Asian minorities participation in separate Houses in a Tricameral Parliament, and Botha became the first Executive State President. The idea was that the Coloured minority could be granted voting rights, but the Black majority were to become citizens of independent homelands. These separate arrangements continued until the abolition of apartheid. The Tricameral reforms led to the formation of the (anti-apartheid) United Democratic Front as a vehicle to try to prevent the co-option of Coloureds and Indians into an alliance with Whites. The battles between the UDF and the NP government from 1983 to 1989 were to become the most intense period of struggle between left-wing and right-wing South Africans.\n\nEducation was segregated by the 1953 Bantu Education Act, which crafted a separate system of education for black South African students and was designed to prepare black people for lives as a labouring class. In 1959 separate universities were created for black, Coloured and Indian people. Existing universities were not permitted to enroll new black students. The Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974 required the use of Afrikaans and English on an equal basis in high schools outside the homelands.\n\nIn the 1970s, the state spent ten times more per child on the education of white children than on black children within the Bantu Education system (the education system in black schools within white South Africa). Higher education was provided in separate universities and colleges after 1959. Eight black universities were created in the homelands. Fort Hare University in the Ciskei (now Eastern Cape) was to register only Xhosa-speaking students. Sotho, Tswana, Pedi and Venda speakers were placed at the newly founded University College of the North at Turfloop, while the University College of Zululand was launched to serve Zulu students. Coloureds and Indians were to have their own establishments in the Cape and Natal respectively.\n\nEach black homeland controlled its own education, health and police systems.\n\nBy 1948, before formal Apartheid, 10 universities existed in South Africa: four were Afrikaans, four for English, one for Blacks and a Correspondence University open to all ethnic groups. By 1981, under apartheid government, 11 new universities were built: seven for Blacks, one for Coloreds, one for Indians, one for Afrikaans and one dual-language medium Afrikaans and English.\n\nColonialism and apartheid had a major impact on Black and Coloured women, since they suffered both racial and gender discrimination. Jobs were often hard to find. Many Black and Coloured women worked as agricultural or domestic workers, but wages were extremely low, if existent. Children suffered from diseases caused by malnutrition and sanitation problems, and mortality rates were therefore high. The controlled movement of black and Coloured workers within the country through the Natives Urban Areas Act of 1923 and the pass laws separated family members from one another, because men could prove their employment in urban centres while most women were merely dependents; consequently, they risked being deported to rural areas.\n\nBy the 1930s, association football mirrored the balkanised society of South Africa; football was divided into numerous institutions based on race: the (White) South African Football Association, the South African Indian Football Association (SAIFA), the South African African Football Association (SAAFA) and its rival the South African Bantu Football Association, and the South African Coloured Football Association (SACFA). Lack of funds to provide proper equipment would be noticeable in regards to black amateur football matches; this revealed the unequal lives black South Africans were subject to, in contrast to Whites, who were much better off financially. Apartheid's social engineering made it more difficult to compete across racial lines. Thus, in an effort to centralise finances, the federations merged in 1951, creating the South African Soccer Federation (SASF), which brought Black, Indian, and Coloured national associations into one body that opposed apartheid. This was generally opposed more and more by the growing apartheid government, andwith urban segregation being reinforced with ongoing racist policiesit was harder to play football along these racial lines. In 1956, the Pretoria regimethe administrative capital of South Africapassed the first apartheid sports policy; by doing so, it emphasised the White-led government's opposition to inter-racialism.\n\nWhile football was plagued by racism, it also played a role in protesting apartheid and its policies. With the international bans from FIFA and other major sporting events, South Africa would be in the spotlight internationally. In a 1977 survey, white South Africans ranked the lack of international sport as one of the three most damaging consequences of apartheid. By the mid-1950s, Black South Africans would also use media to challenge the \"racialisation\" of sports in South Africa; anti-apartheid forces had begun to pinpoint sport as the \"weakness\" of white national morale. Black journalists for the \"Johannesburg Drum\" magazine were the first to give the issue public exposure, with an intrepid special issue in 1955 that asked, \"Why shouldn't our blacks be allowed in the SA team?\" As time progressed, international standing with South Africa would continue to be strained. In the 1980s, as the oppressive system was slowly collapsing the ANC and National Party started negotiations on the end of apartheid. Football associations also discussed the formation of a single, non-racial controlling body. This unity process accelerated in the late 1980s and led to the creation, in December 1991, of an incorporated South African Football Association. On 3 July 1992, FIFA finally welcomed South Africa back into international football.\n\nSport has long been an important part of life in South Africa, and the boycotting of games by international teams had a profound effect on the white population, perhaps more so than the trade embargoes did. After the re-acceptance of South Africa's sports teams by the international community, sport played a major unifying role between the country's diverse ethnic groups. Mandela's open support of the predominantly white rugby fraternity during the 1995 Rugby World Cup was considered instrumental in bringing together South African sports fans of all races.\n\nDefining its Asian population, a minority that did not appear to belong to any of the initial three designated non-white groups, was a constant dilemma for the apartheid government.\n\nFor political reasons, the classification of \"honorary white\" was granted to immigrants from Japan, South Korea and Taiwancountries with which South Africa maintained diplomatic and economic relationsand to their descendants.\n\nIndian South Africans during apartheid were classified many ranges of categories from \"Asian\" to \"black\" to \"Coloured\" and even the mono-ethnic category of \"Indian\", but never as white, having been considered \"nonwhite\" throughout South Africa's history. The group faced severe discrimination during the apartheid regime and were subject to numerous racialist policies.\n\nIn a study done by Josephine C. Naidoo and Devi Moodley Rajab, they interviewed a series of Indian South Africans about their experience in South Africa. Their study highlighted education, the workplace, and general day to day living. One participant who was a doctor said that it was considered the norm for Non-White and White doctors to mingle while working at the hospital but when there was any down time or breaks, they were to go back to their segregated quarters. Not only was there severe segregation for doctors, Non-White, more specifically Indians, were paid three to four times less than their White counterparts. Many described being treated as a “third class citizen” due to the humiliation of the standard of treatment for Non-White employees across many professions. Many Indians described a sense of justified superiority from Whites due to the apartheid laws that, in the minds of White South Africans, legitimised those feelings. Another finding of this study was the psychological damage done to Indians living in South Africa during apartheid. One of the biggest long-term effects was inter-racial mistrust. Inter-racial mistrust is emotional hatred towards Whites. There was such a strong degree of alienation that left damaging psychological effects of inferiority.\n\nChinese South Africanswho were descendants of migrant workers who came to work in the gold mines around Johannesburg in the late 19th centurywere initially either classified as \"Coloured\" or \"Other Asian\" and were subject to numerous forms of discrimination and restriction. It was not until 1984 that South African Chinese, increased to about 10,000, were given the same official rights as the Japanese, to be treated as whites in terms of the Group Areas Act, although they still faced discrimination and did not receive all the benefits/rights of their newly obtained honorary white status such as voting.\n\nIndonesians arrived at the Cape of Good Hope as slaves until the abolishment of slavery during the 19th century. They were predominantly Muslim, were allowed religious freedom and formed their own ethnic group/community known as Cape Malays. They were classified as part of the Coloured racial group. This was the same for South Africans of Malaysian descent who were also classified as part of the Coloured race and thus considered \"not-white\". South Africans of Filipino descent were classified as \"black\" due to historical outlook on Filipinos by White South Africans, and many of them lived in Bantustans.\n\nThe Lebanese population were somewhat of an anomaly during the apartheid era. Lebanese immigration to South Africa was chiefly Christian, and were originally classified as non-white; however, a court case in 1913 ruled that because Lebanese and Syrians originated from the Canaan region (the birthplace of Christianity and Judaism), they could not be discriminated against by race laws which targeted non-believers, and thus, were classified as white. The Lebanese community maintained their white status after the Population Registration Act came into effect; however, immigration from the Middle East was restricted.\n\nAlongside apartheid, the National Party implemented a programme of social conservatism. Pornography and gambling were banned. Cinemas, shops selling alcohol and most other businesses were forbidden from opening on Sundays. Abortion, homosexuality and sex education were also restricted; abortion was legal only in cases of rape or if the mother's life was threatened.\n\nTelevision was not introduced until 1976 because the government viewed English programming as a threat to the Afrikaans language. Television was run on apartheid linesTV1 broadcast in Afrikaans and English (geared to a White audience), TV2 in Zulu and Xhosa, TV3 in Sotho, Tswana and Pedi (both geared to a Black audience), and TV4 mostly showed programmes for an urban Black audience.\n\nApartheid sparked significant internal resistance. The government responded to a series of popular uprisings and protests with police brutality, which in turn increased local support for the armed resistance struggle.\nInternal resistance to the apartheid system in South Africa came from several sectors of society and saw the creation of organisations dedicated variously to peaceful protests, passive resistance and armed insurrection.\n\nIn 1949, the youth wing of the African National Congress (ANC) took control of the organisation and started advocating a radical black nationalist programme. The new young leaders proposed that white authority could only be overthrown through mass campaigns. In 1950 that philosophy saw the launch of the Programme of Action, a series of strikes, boycotts and civil disobedience actions that led to occasional violent clashes with the authorities.\n\nIn 1959, a group of disenchanted ANC members formed the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), which organised a demonstration against pass books on 21 March 1960. One of those protests was held in the township of Sharpeville, where 69 people were killed by police in the Sharpeville massacre.\n\nIn the wake of Sharpeville, the government declared a state of emergency. More than 18,000 people were arrested, including leaders of the ANC and PAC, and both organisations were banned. The resistance went underground, with some leaders in exile abroad and others engaged in campaigns of domestic sabotage and terrorism.\n\nIn May 1961, before the declaration of South Africa as a Republic, an assembly representing the banned ANC called for negotiations between the members of the different ethnic groupings, threatening demonstrations and strikes during the inauguration of the Republic if their calls were ignored.\n\nWhen the government overlooked them, the strikers (among the main organisers was a 42-year-old, Thembu-origin Nelson Mandela) carried out their threats. The government countered swiftly by giving police the authority to arrest people for up to twelve days and detaining many strike leaders amid numerous cases of police brutality. Defeated, the protesters called off their strike. The ANC then chose to launch an armed struggle through a newly formed military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), which would perform acts of sabotage on tactical state structures. Its first sabotage plans were carried out on 16 December 1961, the anniversary of the Battle of Blood River.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) was created by tertiary students influenced by the Black Power movement in the US. BCM endorsed black pride and African customs and did much to alter the feelings of inadequacy instilled among black people by the apartheid system. The leader of the movement, Steve Biko, was taken into custody on 18 August 1977 and was beaten to death in detention.\n\nIn 1976, secondary students in Soweto took to the streets in the Soweto uprising to protest against the imposition of Afrikaans as the only language of instruction. On 16 June, police opened fire on students protesting peacefully. According to official reports 23 people were killed, but the number of people who died is usually given as 176, with estimates of up to 700. In the following years several student organisations were formed to protest against apartheid, and these organisations were central to urban school boycotts in 1980 and 1983 and rural boycotts in 1985 and 1986.\n\nIn parallel with student protests, labour unions started protest action in 1973 and 1974. After 1976 unions and workers are considered to have played an important role in the struggle against apartheid, filling the gap left by the banning of political parties. In 1979 black trade unions were legalised and could engage in collective bargaining, although strikes were still illegal. Economist Thomas Sowell wrote that basic supply and demand led to violations of Apartheid \"on a massive scale\" throughout the nation, simply because there were not enough white South African business owners to meet the demand for various goods and services. Large portions of the garment industry and construction of new homes, for example, were effectively owned and operated by blacks, who either worked surreptitiously or who circumvented the law with a white person as a nominal, figurehead manager.\n\nIn 1983, anti-apartheid leaders determined to resist the tricameral parliament assembled to form the United Democratic Front (UDF) in order to coordinate anti-apartheid activism inside South Africa. The first presidents of the UDF were Archie Gumede, Oscar Mpetha and Albertina Sisulu; patrons were Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Dr Allan Boesak, Helen Joseph, and Nelson Mandela. Basing its platform on abolishing apartheid and creating a nonracial democratic South Africa, the UDF provided a legal way for domestic human rights groups and individuals of all races to organise demonstrations and campaign against apartheid inside the country. Churches and church groups also emerged as pivotal points of resistance. Church leaders were not immune to prosecution, and certain faith-based organisations were banned, but the clergy generally had more freedom to criticise the government than militant groups did. The UDF, coupled with the protection of the church, accordingly permitted a major role for Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who served both as a prominent domestic voice and international spokesperson denouncing apartheid and urging the creation of a shared nonracial state.\n\nAlthough the majority of whites supported apartheid, some 20 percent did not. Parliamentary opposition was galvanised by Helen Suzman, Colin Eglin and Harry Schwarz, who formed the Progressive Federal Party. Extra-parliamentary resistance was largely centred in the South African Communist Party and women's organisation the Black Sash. Women were also notable in their involvement in trade union organisations and banned political parties.\n\nSouth Africa's policies were subject to international scrutiny in 1960, when UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan criticised them during his Wind of Change speech in Cape Town. Weeks later, tensions came to a head in the Sharpeville Massacre, resulting in more international condemnation. Soon afterwards, Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd announced a referendum on whether the country should become a republic. Verwoerd lowered the voting age for Whites to eighteen years of age and included Whites in South West Africa on the roll. The referendum on 5 October that year asked Whites; \"Are you in favour of a Republic for the Union?\", and 52 percent voted \"Yes\".\n\nAs a consequence of this change of status, South Africa needed to reapply for continued membership of the Commonwealth, with which it had privileged trade links. India had become a republic within the Commonwealth in 1950, but it became clear that African and Asian member states would oppose South Africa due to its apartheid policies. As a result, South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth on 31 May 1961, the day that the Republic came into existence.\n\nThe apartheid system as an issue was first formally brought to the United Nations attention, in order to advocate for the Indians residing in South Africa. On June 22 of 1946, the Indian government requested that the discriminatory treatment of Indians living in South Africa be included on the agenda of the first General Assembly session. In 1952, apartheid was again discussed in the aftermath of the Defiance Campaign, and the UN set up a task team to keep watch on the progress of apartheid and the racial state of affairs in South Africa. Although South Africa's racial policies were a cause for concern, most countries in the UN concurred that this was a domestic affair, which fell outside the UN's jurisdiction.\n\nIn April 1960, the UN's conservative stance on apartheid changed following the Sharpeville massacre, and the Security Council for the first time agreed on concerted action against the apartheid regime. Resolution 134 called upon the nation of South Africa to abandon its policies implementing racial discrimination. The newly founded United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid, scripted and passed Resolution 181 on August 7, 1963, which called upon all states to cease the sale and shipment of all ammunition and military vehicles to South Africa. This clause was finally declared mandatory on 4 November 1977, depriving South Africa of military aid. From 1964 onwards, the US and the UK discontinued their arms trade with South Africa. The Security Council also condemned the Soweto massacre in Resolution 392. In 1977, the voluntary UN arms embargo became mandatory with the passing of Resolution 418. In addition to isolating South Africa militarily, the United Nations General Assembly, encouraged the boycotting of oil sales to South Africa. Other actions taken by the United Nations General Assembly include the request for all nations and organisations, “to suspend cultural, educational, sporting and other exchanges with the racist regime and with organisations or institutions in South Africa which practice apartheid”. Illustrating that over a long period of time, the United Nations was working towards isolating the state of South Africa, by putting pressure on the Apartheid regime.\n\nAfter much debate, by the late-1980s, the United States, the United Kingdom, and 23 other nations had passed laws placing various trade sanctions on South Africa. A disinvestment from South Africa movement in many countries was similarly widespread, with individual cities and provinces around the world implementing various laws and local regulations forbidding registered corporations under their jurisdiction from doing business with South African firms, factories, or banks.\n\nPope John Paul II was an outspoken opponent of apartheid. In 1985, while visiting the Netherlands, he gave an impassioned speech at the International Court of Justice condemning apartheid, proclaiming that \"no system of apartheid or separate development will ever be acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races.\" In September 1988, he made a pilgrimage to countries bordering South Africa, while demonstratively avoiding South Africa itself. During his visit to Zimbabwe, he called for economic sanctions against the South African government.\n\nThe Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was created in 1963. Its primary objectives were to eradicate colonialism and improve social, political and economic situations in Africa. It censured apartheid and demanded sanctions against South Africa. African states agreed to aid the liberation movements in their fight against apartheid. In 1969, fourteen nations from Central and East Africa gathered in Lusaka, Zambia, and formulated the \"Lusaka Manifesto\", which was signed on 13 April by all of the countries in attendance except Malawi. This manifesto was later taken on by both the OAU and the United Nations.\n\nThe Lusaka Manifesto summarized the political situations of self-governing African countries, condemning racism and inequity, and calling for Black majority rule in all African nations. It did not rebuff South Africa entirely, though, adopting an appeasing manner towards the apartheid government, and even recognizing its autonomy. Although African leaders supported the emancipation of Black South Africans, they preferred this to be attained through peaceful means.\n\nSouth Africa's negative response to the Lusaka Manifesto and rejection of a change to its policies brought about another OAU announcement in October 1971. The \"Mogadishu Declaration\" stated that South Africa's rebuffing of negotiations meant that its Black people could only be freed through military means, and that no African state should converse with the apartheid government.\n\nIn 1966, B. J. Vorster became Prime Minister. He was not prepared to dismantle apartheid, but he did try to redress South Africa's isolation and to revitalise the country's global reputation, even those with Black majority rule in Africa. This he called his \"Outward-Looking\" policy.\n\nVorster's willingness to talk to African leaders stood in contrast to Verwoerd's refusal to engage with leaders such as Abubakar Tafawa Balewa of Nigeria in 1962 and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia in 1964. In 1966, he met the heads of the neighbouring states of Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana. In 1967, he offered technological and financial aid to any African state prepared to receive it, asserting that no political strings were attached, aware that many African states needed financial aid despite their opposition to South Africa's racial policies. Many were also tied to South Africa economically because of their migrant labour population working down the South African mines. Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland remained outspoken critics of apartheid, but were dependent on South African economic assistance.\n\nMalawi was the first not-neighbouring country to accept South African aid. In 1967, the two states set out their political and economic relations. In 1969, Malawi was the only country at the assembly which did not sign the Lusaka Manifesto condemning South Africa' apartheid policy. In 1970, Malawian president Hastings Banda made his first and most successful official stopover in South Africa.\n\nAssociations with Mozambique followed suit and were sustained after that country won its sovereignty in 1975. Angola was also granted South African loans. Other countries which formed relationships with South Africa were Liberia, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritius, Gabon, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and the Central African Republic. Although these states condemned apartheid (more than ever after South Africa's denunciation of the Lusaka Manifesto), South Africa's economic and military dominance meant that they remained dependent on South Africa to varying degrees.\n\nSouth Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid-1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of them having players of different races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the International Table Tennis Federation severed its ties with the all-White South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games.\n\nIn 1959, the non-racial South African Sports Association (SASA) was formed to secure the rights of all players on the global field. After meeting with no success in its endeavours to attain credit by collaborating with White establishments, SASA approached the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1962, calling for South Africa's expulsion from the Olympic Games. The IOC sent South Africa a caution to the effect that, if there were no changes, they would be barred from competing at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo. The changes were initiated, and in January 1963, the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC) was set up. The Anti-Apartheid Movement persisted in its campaign for South Africa's exclusion, and the IOC acceded in barring the country from the 1964 Olympic Games. South Africa selected a multi-racial team for the next Olympic Games, and the IOC opted for incorporation in the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games. Because of protests from AAMs and African nations, however, the IOC was forced to retract the invitation.\n\nForeign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa, until the 1970 All Blacks rugby tour allowed Maori to enter the country under the status of \"honorary Whites\". Huge and widespread protests occurred in New Zealand in 1981 against the Springbok tourthe government spent $8,000,000 protecting games using the army and police force. A planned All Black tour to South Africa in 1985 remobilised the New Zealand protesters and it was cancelled. A \"rebel tour\"not government sanctionedwent ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid.\n\nOn 6 September 1966, Verwoerd was fatally stabbed at Parliament House by parliamentary messenger Dimitri Tsafendas, who was arrested and quickly imprisoned. John Vorster took office shortly after, and announced that South Africa would no longer dictate to the international community what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for international sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit Basil D'Oliveira, a Coloured South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. \"Dolly\" was eventually included in the team as the first substitute, but the tour was cancelled. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, including that of an England rugby team touring South Africa in 1969/70.\n\nThe first of the \"White Bans\" occurred in 1971 when the Chairman of the Australian Cricketing AssociationSir Don Bradmanflew to South Africa to meet Vorster. Vorster had expected Bradman to allow the tour of the Australian cricket team to go ahead, but things became heated after Bradman asked why Black sportsmen were not allowed to play cricket. Vorster stated that Blacks were intellectually inferior and had no finesse for the game. Bradmanthinking this ignorant and repugnantasked Vorster if he had heard of a man named Garry Sobers. On his return to Australia, Bradman released a short statement: \"We will not play them until they choose a team on a non-racist basis.\" Bradman's views were in stark contrast to those of Australian tennis great Margaret Court, who had won the grand slam the previous year and commented about apartheid that \"South Africans have this thing better organised than any other country, particularly America\" and that she would \"go back there any time.\"\n\nIn South Africa, Vorster vented his anger publicly against Bradman, while the African National Congress rejoiced. This was the first time a predominantly White nation had taken the side of multiracial sport, producing an unsettling resonance that more \"White\" boycotts were coming.\nAlmost twenty years later, on his release from prison, Nelson Mandela asked a visiting Australian statesman if Donald Bradman, his childhood hero, was still alive (Bradman lived until 2001).\n\nIn 1971, Vorster altered his policies even further by distinguishing multiracial from multinational sport. Multiracial sport, between teams with players of different races, remained outlawed; multinational sport, however, was now acceptable: international sides would not be subject to South Africa's racial stipulations.\n\nIn 1978, Nigeria boycotted the Commonwealth Games because New Zealand's sporting contacts with the South African government were not considered to be in accordance with the 1977 Gleneagles Agreement. Nigeria also led the 32-nation boycott of the 1986 Commonwealth Games because of UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's ambivalent attitude towards sporting links with South Africa, significantly affecting the quality and profitability of the Games and thus thrusting apartheid into the international spotlight.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Anti-Apartheid Movements began to campaign for \"cultural\" boycotts of apartheid South Africa. Artists were requested not to present or let their works be hosted in South Africa. In 1963, 45 British writers put their signatures to an affirmation approving of the boycott, and, in 1964, American actor Marlon Brando called for a similar affirmation for films. In 1965, the Writers' Guild of Great Britain called for a proscription on the sending of films to South Africa. Over sixty American artists signed a statement against apartheid and against professional links with the state. The presentation of some South African plays in the United Kingdom and the United States was also vetoed. After the arrival of television in South Africa in 1975, the British Actors Union, Equity, boycotted the service, and no British programme concerning its associates could be sold to South Africa. Similarly, when home video grew popular in the 1980s, the Australian arm of CBS/Fox Video (now 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment) placed stickers on their VHS and Betamax cassettes which labeled exporting such cassettes to South Africa as \"an infringement of copyright\". Sporting and cultural boycotts did not have the same impact as economic sanctions, but they did much to lift consciousness amongst normal South Africans of the global condemnation of apartheid.\n\nWhile international opposition to apartheid grew, the Nordic countriesand Sweden in particularprovided both moral and financial support for the ANC. On 21 February 1986a week before he was murderedSweden's Prime Minister Olof Palme made the keynote address to the \"Swedish People's Parliament Against Apartheid\" held in Stockholm. In addressing the hundreds of anti-apartheid sympathisers as well as leaders and officials from the ANC and the Anti-Apartheid Movement such as Oliver Tambo, Palme declared: \"Apartheid cannot be reformed; it has to be eliminated.\"\n\nOther Western countries adopted a more ambivalent position. In Switzerland, the Swiss-South African Association lobbied on behalf of the South African government. In the 1980s, the Reagan administration and the Thatcher ministry in the UK followed a \"constructive engagement\" policy with the apartheid government, vetoing the imposition of UN economic sanctions, justified by a belief in free trade and a vision of South Africa as a bastion against Marxist forces in Southern Africa. Thatcher declared the ANC a terrorist organisation, and in 1987 her spokesman, Bernard Ingham, famously said that anyone who believed that the ANC would ever form the government of South Africa was \"living in cloud cuckoo land\". The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative lobbying organisation, actively campaigned against divesting from South Africa throughout the 1980s.\n\nBy the late-1980s, with no sign of a political resolution in South Africa, Western patience began to run out. By 1989, a bipartisan Republican/Democratic initiative in the US favoured economic sanctions (realised as the \"Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act\" of 1986), the release of Nelson Mandela and a negotiated settlement involving the ANC. Thatcher too began to take a similar line, but insisted on the suspension of the ANC's armed struggle.\n\nThe UK's significant economic involvement in South Africa may have provided some leverage with the South African government, with both the UK and the US applying pressure and pushing for negotiations. However, neither the UK nor the US was willing to apply economic pressure upon their multinational interests in South Africa, such as the mining company Anglo American. Although a high-profile compensation claim against these companies was thrown out of court in 2004, the US Supreme Court in May 2008 upheld an appeal court ruling allowing another lawsuit that seeks damages of more than US$400 billion from major international companies which are accused of aiding South Africa's apartheid system.\n\nDuring the 1950s, South African military strategy was decisively shaped by fears of communist espionage and a conventional Soviet threat to the strategic Cape trade route between the south Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The apartheid government supported the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as well as its policy of regional \"containment\" against Soviet-backed regimes and insurgencies worldwide. By the late-1960s, the rise of Soviet client states on the African continent, as well as Soviet aid for militant anti-apartheid movements, was considered one of the primary external threats to the apartheid system. South African officials frequently accused domestic opposition groups of being communist proxies. For its part, the Soviet Union viewed South Africa as a bastion of neocolonialism and a regional Western ally, which helped fuel its support for various anti-apartheid causes. From 1973 onwards, much of South Africa's white population increasingly looked upon their country as a bastion of the free world besieged militarily, politically, and culturally by Communism and radical black nationalism. The apartheid government perceived itself as being locked in a proxy struggle with the Warsaw Pact and by implication, armed wings of black nationalist forces such as Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) and the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), which often received Soviet arms and training. This was described as \"Total Onslaught\".\n\nSoviet support for militant anti-apartheid movements worked in the government's favour, as its claim to be reacting in opposition to aggressive communist expansion gained greater plausibility, and helped it justify its own domestic militarisation methods, known as \"Total Strategy\". Total Strategy involved building up a formidable conventional military and counter-intelligence capability. It was formulated on counter-revolutionary tactics as espoused by noted French tactician André Beaufre. Considerable effort was devoted towards circumventing international arms sanctions, and the government even went so far as to develop nuclear weapons, allegedly with covert assistance from Israel. In 2010, \"The Guardian\" released South African government documents that revealed an Israeli offer to sell the apartheid regime nuclear weapons. Israel denied these allegations and claimed that the documents were minutes from a meeting which did not indicate any concrete offer for a sale of nuclear weapons. Shimon Peres said that \"The Guardian\"s article was based on \"selective interpretation...and not on concrete facts.\"\n\nAs a result of \"Total Strategy\", South African society became increasingly militarised. Many domestic civil organisations were modelled upon military structures, and military virtues such as discipline, patriotism, and loyalty were highly regarded. In 1968, national service for White South African men lasted nine months at minimum, and they could be called up for reserve duty into their late-middle age if necessary. The length of national service was gradually extended to twelve months in 1972 and twenty-four months in 1978. At state schools, white male students were organised into military-style formations and drilled as cadets or as participants in a civil defence or \"Youth Preparedness\" curriculum. Compulsory military education and in some cases, paramilitary training was introduced for all older white male students at state schools in three South African provinces. These programmes presided over the construction of bomb shelters at schools and drills aimed at simulating mock insurgent raids.\n\nFrom the late-1970s to the late-1980s, defence budgets in South Africa were raised exponentially. In 1975, Israeli defense minister Shimon Peres signed a security pact with South African defence minister P.W. Botha that led to $200 million in arms deals. In 1988, Israeli arm sales to South Africa totaled over $1.4 billion. Covert operations focused on espionage and domestic counter-subversion became common, the number of special forces units swelled, and the South African Defence Force (SADF) had amassed enough sophisticated conventional weaponry to pose a serious threat to the \"front-line states\", a regional alliance of neighbouring countries opposed to apartheid.\n\nTotal Strategy was advanced in the context of MK, PLAN, and Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) guerrilla raids into South Africa or against South African targets in South West Africa; frequent South African reprisal attacks on these movements' external bases in Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and elsewhere, often involving collateral damage to foreign infrastructure and civilian populations; and periodic complaints brought before the international community about South African violations of its neighbours' sovereignty.\n\nThe apartheid government made judicious use of extraterritorial operations to eliminate its military and political opponents, arguing that neighbouring states, including their civilian populations, which hosted, tolerated on their soil, or otherwise sheltered anti-apartheid insurgent groups could not evade responsibility for provoking retaliatory strikes. While it did focus on militarising the borders and sealing up its domestic territory against insurgent raids, it also relied heavily on an aggressive preemptive and counter-strike strategy, which fulfilled a preventive and deterrent purpose. The reprisals which occurred beyond South Africa's borders involved not only hostile states, but neutral and sympathetic governments as well, often forcing them to react against their will and interests.\n\nExternal South African military operations were aimed at eliminating the training facilities, safehouses, infrastructure, equipment, and manpower of the insurgents. However, their secondary objective was to dissuade neighbouring states from offering sanctuary to MK, PLAN, APLA, and similar organisations. This was accomplished by deterring the supportive foreign population from cooperating with infiltration and thus undermining the insurgents' external sanctuary areas. It would also send a clear message to the host government that collaborating with insurgent forces involved potentially high costs.\n\nThe scale and intensity of foreign operations varied, and ranged from small special forces units carrying out raids on locations across the border which served as bases for insurgent infiltration to major conventional offensives involving armour, artillery, and aircraft. Actions such as Operation Protea in 1981 and Operation Askari in 1983 involved both full scale conventional warfare and a counter-insurgency reprisal operation. The insurgent bases were usually situated near military installations of the host government, so that SADF retaliatory strikes hit those facilities as well and attracted international attention and condemnation of what was perceived as aggression against the armed forces of another sovereign state. This would inevitably result in major engagements, in which the SADF's expeditionary units would have to contend with the firepower of the host government's forces. Intensive conventional warfare of this nature carried the risk of severe casualties among white soldiers, which had to be kept to a minimum for political reasons. There were also high economic and diplomatic costs associated with openly deploying large numbers of South African troops into another country. Furthermore, military involvement on that scale had the potential to evolve into wider conflict situations, in which South Africa became entangled. For example, South Africa's activities in Angola, initially limited to containing PLAN, later escalated to direct involvement in the Angolan Civil War.\n\nAs it became clearer that full-scale conventional operations could not effectively fulfill the requirements of a regional counter-insurgency effort, South Africa turned to a number of alternative methods. Retributive artillery bombardments were the least sophisticated means of reprisal against insurgent attacks. Between 1978 and 1979 the SADF directed artillery fire against locations in Angola and Zambia from which insurgent rockets were suspected to have been launched. This precipitated several artillery duels with the Zambian Army. Special forces raids were launched to harass PLAN and MK by liquidating prominent members of those movements, destroying their offices and safehouses, and seizing valuable records stored at these sites. One example was the Gaborone Raid, carried out in 1985, during which a South African special forces team crossed the border into Botswana and demolished four suspected MK safe houses, severely damaging another four. Other types of special forces operations included the sabotage of economic infrastructure. The SADF sabotaged infrastructure being used for the insurgents' war effort; for example, port facilities in southern Angola's Moçâmedes District, where Soviet arms were frequently offloaded for PLAN, as well as the railway line which facilitated their transport to PLAN headquarters in Lubango, were common targets. Sabotage was also used as a pressure tactic when South Africa was negotiating with a host government to cease providing sanctuary to insurgent forces, as in the case of Operation Argon. Successful sabotage actions of high-profile economic targets undermined a country's ability to negotiate from a position of strength, and made it likelier to accede to South African demands rather than risk the expense of further destruction and war.\n\nAlso noteworthy were South African transnational espionage efforts, which included covert assassinations, kidnappings, and attempts to disrupt the overseas influence of anti-apartheid organisations. South African military intelligence agents were known to have abducted and killed anti-apartheid activists and others suspected of having ties to MK in London and Brussels.\n\nDuring the 1980s the government, led by P.W. Botha, became increasingly preoccupied with security. It set up a powerful state security apparatus to \"protect\" the state against an anticipated upsurge in political violence that the reforms were expected to trigger. The 1980s became a period of considerable political unrest, with the government becoming increasingly dominated by Botha's circle of generals and police chiefs (known as securocrats), who managed the various States of Emergencies.\n\nBotha's years in power were marked also by numerous military interventions in the states bordering South Africa, as well as an extensive military and political campaign to eliminate SWAPO in Namibia. Within South Africa, meanwhile, vigorous police action and strict enforcement of security legislation resulted in hundreds of arrests and bans, and an effective end to the African National Congress' sabotage campaign.\n\nThe government punished political offenders brutally. 40,000 people annually were subjected to whipping as a form of punishment. The vast majority had committed political offences and were lashed ten times for their crime. If convicted of treason, a person could be hanged, and the government executed numerous political offenders in this way.\n\nAs the 1980s progressed, more and more anti-apartheid organisations were formed and affiliated with the UDF. Led by the Reverend Allan Boesak and Albertina Sisulu, the UDF called for the government to abandon its reforms and instead abolish the apartheid system and eliminate the homelands completely.\n\nSerious political violence was a prominent feature from 1985–89, as Black townships became the focus of the struggle between anti-apartheid organisations and the Botha government. Throughout the 1980s, township people resisted apartheid by acting against the local issues that faced their particular communities. The focus of much of this resistance was against the local authorities and their leaders, who were seen to be supporting the government. By 1985, it had become the ANC's aim to make Black townships \"ungovernable\" (a term later replaced by \"people's power\") by means of rent boycotts and other militant action. Numerous township councils were overthrown or collapsed, to be replaced by unofficial popular organisations, often led by militant youth. People's courts were set up, and residents accused of being government agents were dealt extreme and occasionally lethal punishments. Black town councillors and policemen, and sometimes their families, were attacked with petrol bombs, beaten, and murdered by necklacing, where a burning tyre was placed around the victim's neck, after they were restrained by wrapping their wrists with barbed wire. This signature act of torture and murder was embraced by the ANC and its leaders.\n\nOn 20 July 1985, Botha declared a State of Emergency in 36 magisterial districts. Areas affected were the Eastern Cape, and the PWV region (\"Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging\"). Three months later, the Western Cape was included. An increasing number of organisations were banned or listed (restricted in some way); many individuals had restrictions such as house arrest imposed on them. During this state of emergency, about 2,436 people were detained under the Internal Security Act. This act gave police and the military sweeping powers. The government could implement curfews controlling the movement of people. The president could rule by decree without referring to the constitution or to parliament. It became a criminal offence to threaten someone verbally or possess documents that the government perceived to be threatening, to advise anyone to stay away from work or to oppose the government, and to disclose the name of anyone arrested under the State of Emergency until the government released that name, with up to ten years' imprisonment for these offences. Detention without trial became a common feature of the government's reaction to growing civil unrest and by 1988, 30,000 people had been detained. The media was censored, thousands were arrested and many were interrogated and tortured.\n\nOn 12 June 1986, four days before the tenth anniversary of the Soweto uprising, the state of emergency was extended to cover the whole country. The government amended the Public Security Act, including the right to declare \"unrest\" areas, allowing extraordinary measures to crush protests in these areas. Severe censorship of the press became a dominant tactic in the government's strategy and television cameras were banned from entering such areas. The state broadcaster, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), provided propaganda in support of the government. Media opposition to the system increased, supported by the growth of a pro-ANC underground press within South Africa.\n\nIn 1987, the State of Emergency was extended for another two years. Meanwhile, about 200,000 members of the National Union of Mineworkers commenced the longest strike (three weeks) in South African history. The year 1988 saw the banning of the activities of the UDF and other anti-apartheid organisations.\n\nMuch of the violence in the late-1980s and early-1990s was directed at the government, but a substantial amount was between the residents themselves. Many died in violence between members of Inkatha and the UDF-ANC faction. It was later proven that the government manipulated the situation by supporting one side or the other whenever it suited them. Government agents assassinated opponents within South Africa and abroad; they undertook cross-border army and air-force attacks on suspected ANC and PAC bases. The ANC and the PAC in return detonated bombs at restaurants, shopping centres and government buildings such as magistrates courts. Between 1960–1994, according to statistics from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Inkatha Freedom Party was responsible for 4,500 deaths, South African security forces were responsible for 2,700 deaths and the ANC was responsible for 1,300 deaths.\n\nThe state of emergency continued until 1990 when it was lifted by State President F.W. de Klerk.\n\nApartheid developed from the racism of colonial factions and due to South Africa's \"unique industrialisation\". The policies of industrialisation led to the segregation of and classing of people, which was \"specifically developed to nurture early industry such as mining\". Cheap labour was the basis of the economy and this was taken from what the state classed as peasant groups and the migrants. Furthermore, Philip Bonner highlights the \"contradictory economic effects\" as the economy did not have a manufacturing sector, therefore promoting short term profitability but limiting labour productivity and the size of local markets. This also led to its collapse as \"Clarkes emphasises the economy could not provide and compete with foreign rivals as they failed to master cheap labour and complex chemistry\".\n\nThe contradictions in the traditionally capitalist economy of the apartheid state led to considerable debate about racial policy, and division and conflicts in the central state. To a large extent, the political ideology of apartheid had emerged from the colonisation of Africa by European powers which institutionalised racial discrimination and exercised a paternal philosophy of \"civilising inferior natives.\" Some scholars have argued that this can be reflected in Afrikaner Calvinism, with its parallel traditions of racialism; for example, as early as 1933; the executive council of the Broederbond formulated a recommendation for mass segregation.\n\nExternal Western influence, arising from European experiences in colonisation, may be seen as a factor which greatly influenced political attitudes and ideology. Late twentieth-century South Africa was cited as an \"unreconstructed example of western civilisation twisted by racism\".\n\nIn the 1960s, South Africa experienced economic growth second only to that of Japan. Trade with Western countries grew, and investment from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom poured in.\n\nIn 1974, resistance to apartheid was encouraged by Portuguese withdrawal from Mozambique and Angola, after the 1974 Carnation Revolution. South African troops withdrew from Angola early in 1976, failing to prevent the MPLA from gaining power there, and Black students in South Africa celebrated.\n\nThe Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith, signed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all. Its purpose was to provide a blueprint for South Africa by consent and racial peace in a multi-racial society, stressing opportunity for all, consultation, the federal concept, and a Bill of Rights. It caused a split in the United Party that ultimately realigned oppositional politics in South Africa with the formation of the Progressive Federal Party in 1977. The Declaration was the first of several such joint agreements by acknowledged Black and White political leaders in South Africa.\n\nIn 1978, the National Party Defence Minister, Pieter Willem Botha, became Prime Minister. His white minority regime worried about Soviet aid to revolutionaries in South Africa at the same time that South African economic growth had slowed. The South African Government noted that it was spending too much money to maintain segregated homelands created for Blacks, and the homelands were proving to be uneconomical.\n\nNor was maintaining Blacks as third-class citizens working well. Black labour remained vital to the economy, and illegal Black labour unions were flourishing. Many Blacks remained too poor to contribute significantly to the economy through their purchasing poweralthough they composed more than 70% of the population. Botha's regime feared that an antidote was needed to prevent the Blacks' being attracted to Communism.\n\nIn July 1979, the Nigerian Government alleged that the Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) was selling Nigerian oil to South Africa, though there was little evidence or commercial logic for such sales. The alleged sanctions-breaking was used to justify the seizure of some of BP's assets in Nigeria including their stake in SPDC, although it appears the real reasons were economic nationalism and domestic politics ahead of the Nigerian elections. Many South Africans attended schools in Nigeria, and Nelson Mandela acknowledged the role of Nigeria in the struggle against apartheid on several occasions.\n\nIn the 1980s, anti-apartheid movements in the United States and Europe were gaining support for boycotts against South Africa, for the withdrawal of US companies from South Africa, and for release of imprisoned Nelson Mandela. South Africa was sinking to the bottom of the international community. Investment in South Africa was ending and an active policy of disinvestment had begun.\n\nIn the early-1980s, Botha's National Party government started to recognise the inevitability of the need to reform the apartheid system. Early reforms were driven by a combination of internal violence, international condemnation, changes within the National Party's constituency, and changing demographicswhites constituted only 16% of the total population, in comparison to 20% fifty years earlier.\n\nIn 1983, a new constitution was passed implementing what was called the Tricameral Parliament, giving Coloureds and Indians voting rights and parliamentary representation in separate housesthe House of Assembly (178 members) for Whites, the House of Representatives (85 members) for Coloureds and the House of Delegates (45 members) for Indians. Each House handled laws pertaining to its racial group's \"own affairs\", including health, education and other community issues. All laws relating to \"general affairs\" (matters such as defence, industry, taxation and Black affairs) were handled by a Cabinet made up of representatives from all three houses. However, the White chamber had a large majority on this Cabinet, ensuring that effective control of the country remained in the hands of the White minority. Blacks, although making up the majority of the population, were excluded from representation; they remained nominal citizens of their homelands. The first Tricameral elections were largely boycotted by Coloured and Indian voters, amid widespread rioting.\n\nConcerned over the popularity of Mandela, Botha denounced him as an arch-Marxist committed to violent revolution, but to appease Black opinion and nurture Mandela as a benevolent leader of Blacks, the government transferred him from the maximum security Robben Island to the lower security Pollsmoor Prison just outside Cape Town; where prison life was more comfortable for him. The government allowed Mandela more visitors, including visits and interviews by foreigners, to let the world know that he was being treated well.\n\nBlack homelands were declared nation-states and pass laws were abolished. Black labour unions were legitimised, the government recognised the right of Blacks to live in urban areas permanently and gave Blacks property rights there. Interest was expressed in rescinding the law against interracial marriage and also rescinding the law against sexual relations between different races, which was under ridicule abroad. The spending for Black schools increased, to one-seventh of what was spent per white child, up from on one-sixteenth in 1968. At the same time, attention was given to strengthening the effectiveness of the police apparatus.\n\nIn January 1985, Botha addressed the government's House of Assembly and stated that the government was willing to release Mandela on condition that Mandela pledge opposition to acts of violence to further political objectives. Mandela's reply was read in public by his daughter Zinzihis first words distributed publicly since his sentence to prison twenty-one years before. Mandela described violence as the responsibility of the apartheid regime and said that with democracy there would be no need for violence. The crowd listening to the reading of his speech erupted in cheers and chants. This response helped to further elevate Mandela's status in the eyes of those, both internationally and domestically, who opposed apartheid.\n\nBetween 1986–88, some petty apartheid laws were repealed, along with the pass laws. Botha told White South Africans to \"adapt or die\" and twice he wavered on the eve of what were billed as \"rubicon\" announcements of substantial reforms, although on both occasions he backed away from substantial changes. Ironically, these reforms served only to trigger intensified political violence through the remainder of the 1980s as more communities and political groups across the country joined the resistance movement. Botha's government stopped short of substantial reforms, such as lifting the ban on the ANC, PAC and SACP and other liberation organisations, releasing political prisoners, or repealing the foundation laws of grand apartheid. The government's stance was that they would not contemplate negotiating until those organisations \"renounced violence\".\n\nBy 1987, South Africa's economy was growing at one of the lowest rates in the world, and the ban on South African participation in international sporting events was frustrating many whites in South Africa. Examples of African states with Black leaders and White minorities existed in Kenya and Zimbabwe. Whispers of South Africa one day having a Black President sent more hardline whites into supporting right-wing political parties. Mandela was moved to a four-bedroom house of his own, with a swimming pool and shaded by fir trees, on a prison farm just outside of Cape Town. He had an unpublicised meeting with Botha. Botha impressed Mandela by walking forward, extending his hand and pouring Mandela's tea. The two had a friendly discussion, with Mandela comparing the African National Congress' rebellion with that of the Afrikaner rebellion and talking about everyone being brothers.\n\nA number of clandestine meetings were held between the ANC-in-exile and various sectors of the internal struggle, such as women and educationalists. More overtly, a group of White intellectuals met the ANC in Senegal for talks known as the Dakar Conference.\n\nEarly in 1989, Botha suffered a stroke; he was prevailed upon to resign in February 1989. He was succeeded as president later that year by F.W. de Klerk. Despite his initial reputation as a conservative, de Klerk moved decisively towards negotiations to end the political stalemate in the country. Prior to his term in office, F.W De Klerk had already experienced political success as a result of the power base he had built in the Transvaal. During this time, F.W De Klerk served as chairman to the provincial National Party, which was in favour of the Apartheid regime. The transition of de Klerk's ideology regarding apartheid is seen clearly in his opening address to parliament on 2 February 1990. F.W de Klerk announced that he would repeal discriminatory laws and lift the 30-year ban on leading anti-apartheid groups such as the African National Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress, the South African Communist Party (SACP) and the United Democratic Front. The Land Act was brought to an end. De Klerk also made his first public commitment to release Nelson Mandela, to return to press freedom and to suspend the death penalty. Media restrictions were lifted and political prisoners not guilty of common law crimes were released.\n\nOn 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela was released from Victor Verster Prison after more than 27 years behind bars.\n\nHaving been instructed by the UN Security Council to end its long-standing involvement in South West Africa/Namibia, and in the face of military stalemate in Southern Angola, and an escalation in the size and cost of the combat with the Cubans, the Angolans, and SWAPO forces and the growing cost of the border war, South Africa negotiated a change of control; Namibia became independent on 21 March 1990.\n\nApartheid was dismantled in a series of negotiations from 1990–91, culminating in a transitional period which resulted in the country's 1994 general election, the first in South Africa held with universal suffrage.\n\nIn 1990, negotiations were earnestly begun, with two meetings between the government and the ANC. The purpose of the negotiations was to pave the way for talks towards a peaceful transition towards majority rule. These meetings were successful in laying down the preconditions for negotiations, despite the considerable tensions still abounding within the country. Apartheid legislation was abolished in 1991.\n\nAt the first meeting, the NP and ANC discussed the conditions for negotiations to begin. The meeting was held at Groote Schuur, the President's official residence. They released the Groote Schuur Minute, which said that before negotiations commenced political prisoners would be freed and all exiles allowed to return.\n\nThere were fears that the change of power would be violent. To avoid this, it was essential that a peaceful resolution between all parties be reached. In December 1991, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) began negotiations on the formation of a multiracial transitional government and a new constitution extending political rights to all groups. CODESA adopted a Declaration of Intent and committed itself to an \"undivided South Africa\".\n\nReforms and negotiations to end apartheid led to a backlash among the right-wing White opposition, leading to the Conservative Party winning a number of by-elections against NP candidates. De Klerk responded by calling a Whites-only referendum in March 1992 to decide whether negotiations should continue. 68% voted in favour, and the victory instilled in de Klerk and the government a lot more confidence, giving the NP a stronger position in negotiations.\n\nWhen negotiations resumed in May 1992, under the tag of CODESA II, stronger demands were made. The ANC and the government could not reach a compromise on how power should be shared during the transition to democracy. The NP wanted to retain a strong position in a transitional government, and the power to change decisions made by parliament.\n\nPersistent violence added to the tension during the negotiations. This was due mostly to the intense rivalry between the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the ANC and the eruption of some traditional tribal and local rivalries between the Zulu and Xhosa historical tribal affinities, especially in the Southern Natal provinces. Although Mandela and Buthelezi met to settle their differences, they could not stem the violence. One of the worst cases of ANC-IFP violence was the Boipatong massacre of 17 June 1992, when 200 IFP militants attacked the Gauteng township of Boipatong, killing 45. Witnesses said that the men had arrived in police vehicles, supporting claims that elements within the police and army contributed to the ongoing violence. Subsequent judicial inquiries found the evidence of the witnesses to be unreliable or discredited, and that there was no evidence of National Party or police involvement in the massacre. When de Klerk visited the scene of the incident he was initially warmly welcomed, but he was suddenly confronted by a crowd of protesters brandishing stones and placards. The motorcade sped from the scene as police tried to hold back the crowd. Shots were fired by the police, and the PAC stated that three of its supporters had been gunned down. Nonetheless, the Boipatong massacre offered the ANC a pretext to engage in brinkmanship. Mandela argued that de Klerk, as head of state, was responsible for bringing an end to the bloodshed. He also accused the South African police of inciting the ANC-IFP violence. This formed the basis for ANC's withdrawal from the negotiations, and the CODESA forum broke down completely at this stage.\n\nThe Bisho massacre on 7 September 1992 brought matters to a head. The Ciskei Defence Force killed 29 people and injured 200 when they opened fire on ANC marchers demanding the reincorporation of the Ciskei homeland into South Africa. In the aftermath, Mandela and de Klerk agreed to meet to find ways to end the spiralling violence. This led to a resumption of negotiations.\n\nRight-wing violence also added to the hostilities of this period. The assassination of Chris Hani on 10 April 1993 threatened to plunge the country into chaos. Hani, the popular General Secretary of the South African Communist Party (SACP), was assassinated in 1993 in Dawn Park in Johannesburg by Janusz Waluś, an anti-Communist Polish refugee who had close links to the White nationalist Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB). Hani enjoyed widespread support beyond his constituency in the SACP and ANC and had been recognised as a potential successor to Mandela; his death brought forth protests throughout the country and across the international community, but ultimately proved a turning point, after which the main parties pushed for a settlement with increased determination. On 25 June 1993, the AWB used an armoured vehicle to crash through the doors of the Kempton Park World Trade Centre where talks were still going ahead under the Negotiating Council, though this did not derail the process.\n\nIn addition to the continuing \"black-on-black\" violence, there were a number of attacks on white civilians by the PAC's military wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA). The PAC was hoping to strengthen their standing by attracting the support of the angry, impatient youth. In the St James Church massacre on 25 July 1993, members of the APLA opened fire in a church in Cape Town, killing 11 members of the congregation and wounding 58.\n\nIn 1993, de Klerk and Mandela were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \"for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa\".\n\nViolence persisted right up to the 1994 general election. Lucas Mangope, leader of the Bophuthatswana homeland, declared that it would not take part in the elections. It had been decided that, once the temporary constitution had come into effect, the homelands would be incorporated into South Africa, but Mangope did not want this to happen. There were strong protests against his decision, leading to a coup d'état in Bophuthatswana on 10 March that deposed Mangope, despite the intervention of white right-wingers hoping to maintain him in power. Three AWB militants were killed during this intervention, and harrowing images were shown on national television and in newspapers across the world.\n\nTwo days before the election, a car bomb exploded in Johannesburg, killing nine people. The day before the elections, another one went off, injuring 13. At midnight on 26–27 April 1994 the old flag was lowered, and the old (now co-official) national anthem \"Die Stem\" (\"The Call\") was sung, followed by the raising of the new rainbow flag and singing of the other co-official anthem, \"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\" (\"God Bless Africa\").\n\nThe election was held on 27 April 1994 and went off peacefully throughout the country as 20,000,000 South Africans cast their votes. There was some difficulty in organising the voting in rural areas, but people waited patiently for many hours to vote amidst a palpable feeling of goodwill. An extra day was added to give everyone the chance. International observers agreed that the elections were free and fair. The European Union's report on the election compiled at the end of May 1994, published two years after the election, criticised the Independent Electoral Commission's lack of preparedness for the polls, the shortages of voting materials at many voting stations, and the absence of effective safeguards against fraud in the counting process. In particular, it expressed disquiet that \"no international observers had been allowed to be present at the crucial stage of the count when party representatives negotiated over disputed ballots.\" This meant that both the electorate and the world were \"simply left to guess at the way the final result was achieved.\"\n\nThe ANC won 62.65% of the vote, less than the 66.7 percent that would have allowed it to rewrite the constitution. 252 of the 400 seats went to members of the African National Congress. The NP captured most of the White and Coloured votes and became the official opposition party. As well as deciding the national government, the election decided the provincial governments, and the ANC won in seven of the nine provinces, with the NP winning in the Western Cape and the IFP in KwaZulu-Natal. On 10 May 1994, Mandela was sworn in as the new President of South Africa. The Government of National Unity was established, its cabinet made up of 12 ANC representatives, six from the NP, and three from the IFP. Thabo Mbeki and de Klerk were made deputy presidents.\n\nThe anniversary of the elections, 27 April, is celebrated as a public holiday known as Freedom Day.\n\nThe following individuals, who had previously supported apartheid, made public apologies:\n\n"}

{"id": "2200542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200542", "title": "United Nations Operation in the Congo", "text": "United Nations Operation in the Congo\n\nThe United Nations Operation in the Congo (, abbreviated to ONUC) was a peacekeeping force established by the United Nations to maintain order in the Republic of the Congo on 14 July 1960 amid the Congo Crisis. ONUC was the UN's first peacekeeping mission with significant military capabilities. It was withdrawn in 1964.\n\nFollowing Security Council actions, the United Nations Organisation in the Congo was established. To carry out these tasks, the Secretary-General set up a United Nations Force—at its peak strength numbering nearly 20,000. The UN Force stayed in the Congo between 1960 and 1964, and underwent a transition from a peacekeeping presence to a military force.\n\nONUC's main goals stayed consistent from the first to fifth resolution. It aimed to both have Belgian military personnel (later expanding to mercenaries) withdrawn and to provide military assistance to ensure internal stability. The successive Security Council resolutions added to and elaborated on the initial mandate but did not fundamentally change the operation's objectives. These were especially significant because Belgium's invasion violated the norm of sovereignty, and the second objective was set to prevent the country from becoming a Cold War client state.\n\nThe first troops reached Congo on 15 July 1960, many airlifted by the United States Air Force as part of Operation New Tape.\n\nPrime Minister Patrice Lumumba, dissatisfied with Dag Hammarskjöld's refusal to use UN troops to subdue the insurrection in Katanga, decided to attempt an invasion of Katanga on his own and turned to the Soviet Union for help. The invasion attempt never reached Katanga but led to dissension within the Central Government, the collapse of the Central Government, and eventually to Lumumba's arrest in December. Lumumba was then executed in Katanga in January 1961. Only then did the United Nations Security Council explicitly authorize the use of force for purposes beyond self-defense.\n\nThe Congo became independent on 30 June 1960, but the Belgian commander, Lieutenant General Émile Janssens, refused to rapidly \"Africanize\" the officers' corps of the Force Publique (the army), resulting in disorder and mutinies. While the President and the Prime Minister were trying to negotiate with the mutineers, the Belgian government decided to intervene to protect Belgians that remained in the country. It also, with the acceptance of Moïse Tshombé, sent troops to take over Katanga and establish a secession there to protect mining interests. Katanga was rich in minerals and natural resources.\n\nOn 10 July, Belgian troops were sent to Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga, to control the situation and protect Belgian civilians. There were 100,000 Belgians living in the Congo at the time, and many were in a state of panic. The presence of Belgian troops was illegal under international law, as Congolese officials had not requested their presence. With the help of the Belgians, who wrote all his declarations, Tshombé proclaimed the independence of the new State of Katanga. On 12 July, the President and the Prime Minister asked for help from the UN. The UN Secretary-General addressed the UN Security Council at a night meeting on 13 July and asked the Council to act \"with utmost speed\" on the request.\n\nAt the same meeting, the Security Council adopted Resolution 143 (1960), by which it called upon the Government of Belgium to withdraw its troops from the territory of the Congo. The resolution authorized the Secretary-General to facilitate the withdrawal of Belgian troops, maintain law and order, and help to establish and legitimize the post-colonial government. This mission was approved by a Security Council vote eight in favor and none against, with three countries abstaining. Both the United States and Soviet Union voted in favor. This mandate was extended to maintain the territorial integrity of Congo, particularly through the removal of the foreign mercenaries supporting the secession of Katanga. ONUC's intention was an unprecedented role for a UN peacekeeping force, as it was not self-evidently peacekeeping in nature.\n\nThe United Nations stated four goals for the operation: first, to restore law and order, second, to keep other nations out of the crisis, third, to help build the country's economy, and fourth, to restore stability. A peacekeeping force had landed in the country within 48 hours of the resolution, as well as civilian experts who were tasked with keeping the country's infrastructure operating smoothly.\n\nLumumba asked the United Nations to intervene and use military force to stop Tshombe's forces in Katanga. The first UN troops arrived on 15 July but there was instant disagreement between Lumumba and the UN over the new force's mandate. Because the Congolese army had been in disarray since the mutiny, Lumumba wanted to use the UN troops to subdue Katanga by force. Lumumba wrote to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, that from the text of United Nations Security Council Resolution 143 \"it is clear that, contrary to your personal interpretation, the UN force may be used to subdue the rebel government of Katanga.\" Secretary General Hammarskjöld refused. To Hammarskjöld, the secession of Katanga was an internal Congolese matter and the UN was forbidden to intervene by Article 2 of the United Nations Charter. Disagreements over what the UN force could and could not do continued throughout its deployment.\n\nIn response, Lumumba accused the UN of siding with Tshombe and foreign mining companies. Lumumba then asked the Soviet Union for assistance and received aid in the form of trucks and aircraft. Using material of the former Force Publique, Lumumba ordered the army to launch an attack on the breakaway Katanga province, but failed to take it back. President Joseph Kasa-Vubu dismissed Lumumba. However, Lumumba refused to step down.\n\nBy 20 July 1960, 3,500 troops for ONUC had arrived in the Congo. The 3,500 consisted of 460 troops from the Ethiopian Army (later to grow into the Tekil Brigade), 770 troops from the Ghana Armed Forces, 1,250 troops from Morocco and 1,020 troops from the Tunisian Armed Forces. The first contingent of Belgian forces had left Leopoldville on 16 July upon the arrival of the United Nations troops. Following assurances that contingents of the Force would arrive in sufficient numbers, the Belgian authorities agreed to withdraw all their forces from the Leopoldville area by 23 July. The last Belgian troops left the country by 23 July, as United Nations forces continued to deploy throughout the Congo. The buildup continued, ONUC's strength increasing to over 8,000 by 25 July and to over 11,000 by 31 July 1960. A basic agreement between the United Nations and the Congolese Government on the operation of the Force was finalized by 27 July.\n\nOn 9 August 1960, Kalonji declared the region of south-eastern Kasai, on the Congo's southern border with Portuguese Angola, to be the new Mining State of South Kasai (\"État minier du Sud-Kasaï\") or Autonomous State of South Kasai (\"État autonome du Sud-Kasaï\"). The use of the word \"state\" (\"état\") was deliberately ambiguous, allowing Kalonji to avoid specifying whether the South Kasai claimed to independence as a nation-state in imitation of Katanga, or as a province within the Congo. Due to rejection of requests to the UN for aid to suppress the South Kasai and Katanga revolts, the Lumumba Government decided to request Soviet assistance. De Witte writes that \"Leopoldville asked the Soviet Union for planes, lorries, arms, and equipment. ...Shortly afterwards, on 22 or 23 August, about 1,000 soldiers left for Kasai.\" De Witte goes on to write that on 26–27 August, the ANC seized Bakwanga, Albert Kalonji's capital in South Kasai, without serious resistance. \"In the next two days it temporarily put an end to the secession of Kasai.\"\n\nBloomfield wrote in 1963 that:\n\n[L]ocal authorities were sensitive of their new independence, nonetheless they were clearly waiting for someone to take action; indeed, the ONUC troops were initially welcomed as saviors from the Belgians. While relationships with the ANC (Armée Nationale Congolaise) were complicated by the latter's lack of responsible commanders at any level, in most instances the ANC during that first month did lay down arms wherever there were UN troops, and ONUC took over custody of arms, ammunition depots, and arsenals. Local UN commanders used their own judgment as to how to keep the Congolese troops under control, with outstanding success in many areas.\n\nBy February 1961, there were four factions in the Congo: Antoine Gizenga (leading Lumumba's followers), Joseph-Desire Mobutu, Tshombe, and the self-appointed King Albert Kalonji. There were four separate armed forces: Mobotu's ANC itself, numbering about 12,000, the South Kasai Constabulary loyal to Albert Kalonji (3,000 or less), the Katanga Gendarmerie which were part of Moise Tshombe's regime (totalling about 10,000), and the Stanleyville dissident ANC loyal to Antoine Gizenga (numbering about 8,000).\n\nEarly in 1961, Patrice Lumumba was assassinated. Jawaharlal Nehru reacted sharply. Calling it “an international crime of the first magnitude”, he asked Hammarskjöld to take a tough line. When the Security Council passed a second resolution on 21 February 1961, Nehru agreed to send an Indian Army brigade of some 4,700 troops to the Congo. The 99th Indian Infantry Brigade was thus dispatched. Thus United Nations mission was strengthened and expanded in response, in an effort to keep foreign mercenaries out of country. In August of that year, three of the four groups claiming control of the country, Lumumba, Mobutu and Kalonji, reconciled with help from the United Nations. It resulted in the restoration of the country's parliament and prevented the outbreak of a large civil war. Tshombe's breakaway Katanga province was not part of this reconciliation. United Nations forces clashed with Tshombe's foreign mercenaries several times late in the year.\n\nOn 17 September 1961, UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld was flying to Rhodesia to negotiate peace talks between the government and Tshombe when Hammarskjöld's plane crashed, killing him. It was a response to the troubled Operation Morthor ongoing at the time. The circumstances of his death were suspicious, and there remains suspicion that his plane was shot down. A recent book by Susan Williams (2011) uncovered evidence that a specially equipped fighter plane from the Belgian-led mercenary force referred to as the Katanga Gendarmerie shot down his plane. Hammarskjöld was succeeded by U Thant.\n\nSwedish troops were assigned to keep order in a huge camp with approximately 40,000 refugees, which hastily grew up in just two weeks during August and September 1961. The camp mainly evolved because the severe persecutions of the Baluba people in the Kasai area. Conditions in the camp were appalling: desperate refugees could murder each other in the crush around food distributions, and there was even cannibalism. A group of about a thousand young men of uncertain origin, called baluba jeunesse, put fear in the camp, committed murder and rioted. The Swedes came to be in open conflict with the baluba jeunesse and on a number of occasions, the situation developed until they shot straight into the angry crowds, killing several people. No legal investigation has been made of the shootings.\n\nAfter Hammarskjöld's death, his replacement, U Thant, took a more aggressive approach. Removing Tshombe from Katanga became the primary military objective for the UN. In December 1961, UN troops from Sweden, Ireland, India, and Ethiopia were involved in heavy fighting for Katanga's capital, Elizabethville. UN forces eventually managed to defeat the Katangan gendarmes in the city and took Elizabethville. During the fighting, eleven Swedish soldiers were taken prisoner; they were released on 15 January 1962 in exchange for Katangan gendarmes.\n\nIn August 1961, under the command of Indian Army's Brigadier-General KAS Raja, the UN launched Operation Rumpunch, a surprise attack that led to the peaceful surrender of 81 foreign mercenaries.\n\nOn 13 September 1961, the most obvious example of the transition from peacekeeping to peace enforcement occurred when the Indian ONUC leadership on the ground leading an Indian brigade, launched \"Operation Morthor\" (Hindi: smash and grab) and swiftly took control of Katanga. The operation was meant to be a stepped up version of the earlier Operation Rumpunch. It has been said that Secretary-General Hammarskjöld did not know the operation was happening. However, it is now clear that he had prior knowledge of the operation.\n\nThe operation led to a serious eight-day military engagement between ONUC and the Katangese forces. Tshombe's paid mercenaries were prepared for the UN forces and launched an effective counterattack. Seven UN troops were killed as well as 200 Katangese civilians and troops. Operation Morthor was executed with Indian support, but without full approval by several member countries of the UN, particularly the UK, France, and United States. The Soviet Union was angrily accusing the US of supporting the assassination of Lumumba, a Soviet ally, and of installing American ally Mobutu as president. The Soviet state interpreted ONUC to now be acting as a proxy for the US rather than supporting the interests of the entire Security Council.\n\nDuring the fighting, a UN spokesperson accounted that the Katanga secession movement was over. Most observers interpreted that as meaning that the UN military forces had successfully defeated Tshombe's troops, but the announcement was premature in every possible way.\n\nDuring the operation, a company of 156 Irish UN troops was attacked by Moise Tshombe's forces in Katanga. The Irish were seriously outnumbered and outgunned, but managed to hold out for six days until they finally ran out of ammunition. The Irish managed to inflict heavy losses against Tshombe's foreign mercenaries, without any of their own being killed themselves. This event is known as the Siege of Jadotville.\n\nThe United Nations launched Operation Unokat in early December 1961, which put pressure on Tshombe to enter serious negotiations with Congolese Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula. On 16 December the attack on Camp Massart took place were the stronghold of the Katangese Gendarmerie was captured. On 21 December Tshombe signed the Kitona Declaration, an agreement whereby he would recognize the authority of the central government and work to reintegrate Katanga into the Republic of the Congo. However, Tshombe subsequently deferred to the Katangan Parliament and put off any action of reconciliation. In January 1962 the rival government of the Free Republic of the Congo was finally subdued and the UN was able to refocus its efforts on ending the Katangan secession. By then contact between the central government and Katanga had broken down, and ONUC intelligence reports indicated that the latter was rebuilding its forces.\n\nIn August 1962 Secretary General Thant drew up a \"Plan for National Reconciliation\" by which Katanga would rejoin a federalized Congo. Adoula and Tshombe both accepted the proposal. Thant was wary of Tshombe's delaying tactics and applied increasing political pressure on the Katangan government to abide by the plan's timetable. Still doubting the likelihood of a peaceful resolution of the Katangan secession, he sent Ralph Bunche to Léopoldville. There, Bunch worked with local UN Mission Chief Robert Gardiner and UN Force Commander Sean MacEoin to create a plan to achieve freedom of movement for ONUC personnel and eliminate the foreign mercenaries. By then it was obvious that Tshombe did not intend on rejoining the Congo; there were 300–500 mercenaries in Katanga (as many as there had been before previous UN operations) and new airfields and defensive positions were being constructed. ONUC personnel and even consuls from troop-contributing supporters of ONUC faced increasing harassment at the hands of Katangan forces.\n\nThe situation came to a breaking point on 24 December 1962 when Katangan gendarmes brazenly attacked peacekeeping forces in Katanga, causing Thant to authorize a retaliatory offensive to decisively eliminate secessionist opposition.\n\nMajor General Dewan Prem Chand launched Operation Grandslam on 28 December and by the end of the day UN troops had seized downtown Élisabethville. Reinforced by recently amassed air power, United Nations peacekeepers successfully completed the first phase of the operation by the end of the year. In early January the United Nations forces turned their attention towards remaining strongholds in southern Katanga. Indian peacekeepers surpassed their orders and crossed the Lufira River ahead of schedule, generating panic behind the Katangan lines and causing an incident among United Nations leadership. Tshombe, realizing that his position was untenable, sued for peace on 15 January 1963. Two days later he signed an instrument of surrender and declared the Katangan secession to be over.\n\nAfter Operation Grandslam, the United Nations shrank the force significantly, only keeping a small peacekeeping force in the country.\n\nBy autumn 1963 plans were underway to remove the United Nations force from the Congo after the reincorporation of Katanga. At that time six battalions of UN troops were stationed in Katanga, one battalion was at Luluabourg, one at Force Headquarters, and administration personnel were at Leopoldville.\n\nCanadian Brigadier-General Jacques Dextraze was sent to the Congo in 1963, to serve as mission Chief of Staff, effectively deputy to the mission's military commander. The military component headquarters, coordinated by Dextraze, was in the process of planning the mission's withdrawal in early 1964 as the Simba rebellion loomed. Dextraze launched a small-scale operation during Pierre Mulele's Kwilu Province uprising of January 1964 in order to save at least some of the threatened aid workers and missionaries under attack from the \"jeunesse\".\nIn May 1964 troops began to withdraw, beginning with the Irish unit in Kolwezi on 11 May, and ending with units in Leopoldville in June. The United Nations also maintained a large civilian staff of 2000 experts in the country throughout 1963 and 1964. The final group of peacekeepers, 85 men of the First Nigerian Battalion and 58 men of the 57th Canadian Signals, departed Ndjili Airport in Leopoldville on 30 June. The last soldier to leave was UN Force Commander Major General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi.\n\nOn 12 July 1960, after the UN Security Council adopted a resolution, calling on Belgium to pull out its forces and the UN to assist the Congolese government, Hammarskjöld appointed as his special representative a senior Indian diplomat: Rajeshwar Dayal, who would later become India's foreign secretary. Lumumba assassination shocked Nehru who reacted sharply. Calling it “an international crime of the first magnitude”, he asked Hammarskjöld to take a tough line. When the Security Council passed a second resolution on 21 February 1961, Nehru agreed to send an Indian Army brigade of some 4,700 troops to the Congo. Kasavubu and Mobutu took great exception to these moves. They had all along resented Dayal's and Nehru's support for Lumumba. Now they threatened dire consequences for the UN mission if Dayal remained at its helm. At Hammarskjöld's request, Nehru agreed that Dayal should step down.\n\nIndian Army involvement then escalated. On 13 September, the 99th Indian Infantry Brigade launched Operation Morthor (Hindi: twist and break) that swiftly took control of Katanga. The staff officer who planned the operation would later become the chief of the Indian Army: Major Krishnaswamy Sundarji. It was in this context that the British government sought to arrange that fateful meeting between Hammarskjöld and Tshombe in Ndola, ostensibly to negotiate a ceasefire.\n\nOn the eve of Operation Rum Punch the UN had 5,720 troops in Katanga; there were 1,600 Indians, 500 Irish, and 400 Swedes in Élisabethville, 1,200 Indians in Albertville, 1,000 Indians at Kamina Base, 500 Indians at Kabalo, 400 Ethiopians and Indians in Manono, and 120 Irish in Jadotville.\n\nNehru's support for the UN in Congo was significant. India sent more troops than any country, and they were active throughout 1962 in stubbing out the secessionist forces, Indian Army units leading the fight. The UN forces were commanded by Indian officers including Major General Dewan Prem Chand. Even during the war with China, Nehru did not insist on an immediate withdrawal of the Indian brigade, but the Canberra bombers that it had deployed, were called back. The troops returned only after the mission was completed in March 1963.\n\nMalaya (now Malaysia) was invited to send a contingent to serve in ONUC. The Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra, in response to the United Nations' request offered a force of 120 men in a telegram to the Secretary-General on 4 August 1960. On 24 August, in another telegram to New York, the force level was increased to 450 men. Eventually, the force level was settled at 613 all ranks. The name given to this force for service with ONUC was Malayan Special Force or MSF in short. The original force was drawn from two of the finest units in the Federation Army - 4th Battalion, the Royal Malay Regiment and 'C' Squadron 2nd Reconnaissance Regiment (now 2 Armour). It had a complement of 42 officers and 571 other ranks.\n\nSweden had an active role in the UN forces during the crisis. When Dag Hammarskjöld established UN Mission ONUC he organized it into two parts: one military and one civilian. The Swedish Major General Carl von Horn became the head of the military part and the Swedish diplomat Sture Linnér was responsible for the civilians. Both of them were subject to American Ralph Bunche, who was appointed head of the whole operation.\n\nIn September 1961, in response to an appeal by the United Nations (UN) for military support, an initial force of five J 29Bs were stationed in the Republic of Congo as a contribution to a UN peacekeeping mission (ONUC) in the region, organized as the F 22 Wing of the Swedish Air Force. It was subsequently reinforced by four more J 29Bs and two S 29C photo reconnaissance Tunnans in 1962. The J 29 was the only combat aircraft at the disposal of the UN, the J 29Bs dispatched receiving the UN identifying legend upon their fuselages.\n\nMost of the missions involved attacking ground targets with internal cannons as well as unguided rockets. No aircraft were lost in action despite large amounts of ground fire. Consensus of the crews and foreign observers was that the Tunnan's capabilities were exceptional. (The Katanga secessionists used a few Fouga Magisters and other aircraft with relatively poor air combat capabilities.) The only aircraft lost was by a high-ranking officer who made a trial run and crashed during an aborted takeoff. When ONUC was terminated in 1964, some of the Swedish aircraft were destroyed at their base, since they were no longer needed at home and the cost of retrieving them was deemed excessive.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1964, the Swedish Army sent a total of nine battalions to Congo. In the initial stage of the crisis, when whites in the Congo became targets during the riots, Dag Hammarskjöld assessed that it was important that there were white UN troops in the country. He therefore requested that Sweden and Ireland would send a battalion each, with the ulterior motive that they would more easily win the confidence of the whites than soldiers from African states. The first Swedish battalion arrived in Congo directly from Gaza 22 July 1960. The first days the Swedes were patrolling in Leopoldville and guarded Kinshasa Airport in the city.\n\nSwedes, like other UN troops, had difficulty knowing who really were friends and who were enemies, and the fighting they engaged in did not always have an apparent rational reason. In August, the Swedes moved to Elizabethville in Katanga, where they ended up in their first combat situation and suffered their first loss in connection with the escort of a rail road transport. The trains, which were carrying Katangan Baluba prisoners, were attacked by Baluba, a nationalist group who supported the central government against the break out government. In practice, at that point, the Swedes fought on the same side as the Belgian-led Katangan gendarmerie, who would later become the UN's worst enemy.\n\nThe Swedes had to try to maintain order in a huge camp with approximately 40,000 Baluba refugees in Kasai which was suddenly formed in just two weeks in 1961, with refugees fleeing Gendarmerie attacks in north Katanga. In 1962, the Swedes moved to the Kamina base, near the town of Kamina. On New Year's Eve 1962, the UN troops advanced towards Kamina, cleared all the gendarmes roadblocks and managed to knock down the organized resistance.\n\nCongo Crisis became by far the most serious international task the Swedish Armed Forces faced during the Cold War, and it was the first time in 140 years that Swedish forces were forced into battle. During the years in Congo, 40 Swedish soldiers were injured and 19 were killed. As late as 2004, it was alleged that the corpses of two killed Swedes were eaten by locals, purportedly because cannibalism was believed by Africans to be a way to assimilate the victim's strength. The event was considered very sensitive to the UN and the Congolese government and the incident was covered up.\n\nA total of 6,334 Swedes served in the Congo during the years 1960-64, 19 died and many wounded. Eleven soldiers were awarded the Swedish Vasa Medal for \"[...] extraordinary courage and commendable action to save human lives [...]\". Two soldiers who received this medal were Stig von Bayer and Torsten Stålnacke.\n\nInformation on the Swedish battllions' deployments in the Congo are as follows:\nThe first Swedish UN battalion in Sinai in 1956 was named Battalion 1. This numbering continued from Battalion 1 to Battalion 9 which was initially deployed in the Sinai and later in Gaza. After Battalion 9 the numbering was changed to include only odd numbers starting with 11 and with additional letter G for Gaza. Battalion 8 was transferred from Gaza to the Congo and then took the name Battalion VIII K (Kongo (Congo)). So, seven of the Congo battalions, 10 to 22, were recruited to serve in ONUC, while the other two were Gaza battalions transferred to the Congo as reinforcements.\n\nThe Irish Army's first large deployment to the Congo was in 1960. The 32nd Infantry Battalion was the first deployment of Irish troops overseas and they were woefully ill-equipped. The standard uniform was a heavy bullswool tunic and trousers and the service rifle was the .303 Lee–Enfield. Issues with kit were eventually solved, new lightweight uniforms were issued and the FN FAL rifle replaced the Lee–Enfield. The Irish Battalions had a huge area to patrol and not much transport to patrol it with. Most patrols consisted of a couple of Land Rovers or Willys CJ3As, carrying soldiers armed with rifles, Gustav M45 submachineguns and Bren Guns. One such patrol was ambushed at Niemba on 8 November 1960 by Baluba tribesmen. Of the 11 Irish soldiers, 9 were killed and only 2 escaped, while 25 Baluba were also killed in the battle. Trooper Anthony Browne was posthumously awarded the Military Medal for Gallantry (the highest Irish military award) for giving his life to save his comrade. As a result of the ambush, the army equipped its contingent with 8 Ford armoured cars. These had been constructed in Ireland during the Second World War as a stop-gap armoured vehicle. Armament consisted of a single turret-mounted Vickers HMG. Modifications included extra ammunition storage, a searchlight and a cooling fan.\n\nThe most famous Irish action of the operation was the Siege of Jadotville where 150 Irish troops of \"A\" Company, 35th Battalion, held out against a much larger force of Katanga Gendarmerie. The Irish fought until their ammunition ran out, inflicting hundreds of casualties on their opponents while suffering only several wounded. However, an attempt by Irish and Swedish reinforcements to relieve them failed, and in the end, the besieged Irish troops were forced to surrender.\n\nA total of 6,000 Irish soldiers served in the Congo from 1960 until 1964, taking 26 casualties in that time. The Congo deployment resulted in greater investment by the government in personal kit and eventually, armoured personnel carriers.\n\nWhen violence erupted in the Congo, Canada had set aside an infantry brigade especially for the use of the United Nations. When Dag Hammarskjold received the offer to send the Canadian Brigade to the Congo he refused stating that \"If outside help was required to resolve the developing crisis, they preferred non-African states to be used as a last resort.\" The United Nations did not wish to turn the Congo Crisis into a Cold War proxy war and so tried to pick peacekeepers from neutral countries. This trans-Atlantic French–speaking country would be Canada, even though as Dr. Spooner put it \"Canada: [was] Just West of Neutral.\" Canadian forces were perfectly suited for a peacekeeping mission in the Congo because they were bilingual, this allowed them to communicate with the mostly English speaking UN troops as well as the French-speaking Belgian and Congolese forces. They could also communicate with the Congolese people.\n\nAll of this occurred prior to there being an official request for assistance from the Congo. The first request for assistance from the Congo requested that the United Nations send technical assistance to support the Force Publique, the armed forces of the Congo. In response, \"the secretary general suggested the dispatch of UN technical personnel to the Congo to assist in restoring order and discipline within the armed forces.\" Canadian National Defence assumed that the United Nations would ask for French-speaking military advisers, the army maintained a standby list of one hundred officers, including many who were bilingual and could be posted abroad on short notice.\" Before Hammarskjold could put his plan into action, however, a second Congolese request arrived, sent directly to the secretary general from President Joseph Kasa-Vubu and Prime Minister Joseph Lumumba, \"the Congolese leaders asked for UN military forces to counter the violent Belgian intervention.\" Again Canada offered combat troops stating that if the need arose for Canadian military intervention in the Congo Canada could also \"deploy one of three French speaking battalions made ready for UN Service.\" The offer for combat troops was again refused, though Hammarskjold officially accepted the Canadian French-speaking officers. Colonel Jean Berthiaume of the Royal 22e Regiment led the UN effort as the mission's first Chief of staff. Berthiaume was congratulated for his impressive organizational skills, but also for his bravery and for his \"initiative, linguistic ability, and special aptitude for negotiating. He became the first Canadian since the Korean War to become an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nIt was during this time that the first formal request for troops in the support of the UN mission was given to Canada, the request included Canadian signals and logistics personnel be sent to the Congo. From Canada the UN needed specifically signals personnel as well as quartermaster and maintenance personnel. The Canadian Signallers were to be used to send communication from the front to the headquarters and vice versa. They were stationed both at ONUC HQ as well as in 10 static signals stations spread throughout the country. Canada also sent a Provost Unit which attempted to promote law and order in the capital. \"At any one time there were more Canadians serving at ONUC HQ than of any other nationality.\" In addition to the Signals Squadron, Canada also sent an advanced reconnaissance party consisting of six officers from the United Nations Military Observer Group in India. \"These men were instructed to determine personnel and equipment requirements, as well as the organization requirements at HQ.\" The reconnaissance party found that \"ONUC HQ personnel did not carry weapons and were able to move about freely without any trouble.\" The Canadian government, however, was scared that their French-speaking peacekeepers could get mistaken for Belgian paratroops, and so \"peacekeepers were given small arms training... depending on rank the troops were issued either Browning automatic pistols or C1 submachine guns, weapons the non-combatant peacekeepers carried for personal defence only.\"\n\nIt soon became clear that these fears were not unwarranted, Canadian peacekeepers were attacked by Congolese troops on several occasions. \"The first incident of serious violence that occurred between Congolese and Canadians occurred at N'Djili Airport, and demonstrated how vulnerable the Canadians could be. Two groups of peacekeepers were waiting to depart on reconnaissance missions, when those destined for Luluabourg were delayed on the tarmac. A patrol of about ten to twelve Congolese soldiers suddenly rushed them... the Congolese forced them facedown onto the tarmac, arms extended and then they kicked them.\" The commanding officer was then knocked out and the remaining Canadian soldiers were herded onto a truck. After about ten minutes the Canadians were rescued by a Danish officer and Ghanain troops. The UN as well as Canada reacted in outrage to this senseless attack against Canadian troops. In turn they praised the Canadian officer for not escalating the situation and responding in due discretion. It was recognized by all parties that the Canadian soldiers were capable of firing on the Congolese troops in self-defence but they did not.\n\nEven though Canada wasn't in the Congo in a combat capacity their involvement came under scrutiny from the USSR. The Soviets began to attack Canadian involvement directly, \"they objected to the use of Canadian peacekeepers because Canada was one of Belgium's NATO allies.\" The Soviets even went so far as to demand \"the withdrawal of armed groups from Canada\". According to Scarnecchia, the Soviets \"accused the RCAF of supplying weapons and armoured steel to Tshombe's forces in secessionist Katanga, they believed that this RCAF support was in line with Western Interests.\" Although these allegations were never proven, in response, the Secretary-General of the UN transferred the RCAF contingent from performing airlift duties in support of the UN mission to a Pisa-Leopoldville airlift of food and aid. This transfer served to somewhat satisfy the Russians and any further scrutiny was mild in comparison. Instead of arguing against UN involvement in the Congo, the Soviets began to provide aid to Prime Minister Lumumba in Leopoldville. Along with the assassination of Lumumba and the death of Secretary-General Hammarskjold, this then led to the use of force by UN troops in the Congo being allowed by the UN. In 1961, UN troops under aggressive commanders pushed into Katanga, and began routing Tshombe's armed forces. As \"clashes between Tshombe and UN forces grew more frequent, the UN moved even more aggressively, and eventually took control of key parts of the province.\"\n\nCanadians would play an important role in nearly every aspect of the UN mission in the Congo, from their detachment at Command HQ to the RCAF Pisa-Leopoldville Airlift on to the Signals Personnel stationed throughout the Congo. Though Canadian involvement came under Soviet attack the Canadian commitment to the mission did not waver and Canadian soldiers stayed in the Congo until the end of the mission in 1964. Canadian forces proved themselves admirably in tough situations when they were attacked by Congolese forces and responded with discipline and tact by not firing on their attackers.\n\nThe greatest strength which the Canadian Contingent in the Congo reached was 461, though 1,900 Canadian soldiers would serve there from 1960–64. There were no casualties except the bruises and cuts given to the Canadian Forces by Congolese troops at N'Djili Airport.\n\nDuring the ensuing Congo Crisis, about 1,800 Canadians from 1960 to 1964 served among the 93,000 predominantly African peacekeepers with the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC), working chiefly as communications signallers and delivering via the Royal Canadian Air Force humanitarian food shipments and logistical support. The Canadian participation stemmed more from overwhelming public opinion, and not decisive action on the part of the Diefenbaker government, according to historians Norman Hillmer and Jack Granatstein. However, Diefenbaker reportedly refused to comply with numerous public calls for Canada to provide humanitarian relief to 230,000 Congolese famine victims in South Kasai in 1961 ostensibly because \"surplus foodstuffs should be distributed to unemployed persons in Canada\" as a first priority. Two Canadians died from non-conflict-related causes, and, out of the 33 Canadians injured in the conflict, twelve received \"severe beatings\" by the Congolese forces. Although Patrice Lumumba dismissed the first incidences of these beatings, on 18 August 1960, as \"unimportant\" and \"blown out of all proportion\" in order for the UN to \"influence public opinion\", he attributed them a day later to the Armée Nationale Congolaise's \"excess of zeal\". Historians have described these incidents as cases of mistaken identity under chaotic circumstances, in which Canadian personnel were confused by Congolese soldiers with Belgian paratroopers, or mercenaries working for the Katanga secession.\n\nOnly a quarter of Canada's signallers extended their six-month tours of duty to a full year, and Canadian forces reportedly found the Congolese to be \"illiterate, very volatile, superstitious and easily influenced\", including an instance where a Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel successfully persuaded Kivu Province's Prime Minister to accept a relief contingent from Malaysia by explaining to him that the Malaysians were capable of diverting bullets in flight away from their intended path. A recent study concluded that while the Canadian government \"demonstrated a greater willingness to accommodate the Congolese prime minister Patrice Lumumba than other Western nations\" and publicly did not side with either faction, it \"[p]rivately [...] favoured the more Western oriented [President] Kasavubu\". however financial assistance was turned down by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. Canada's troops earned the trust of Joseph Mobutu, the latter visiting Canada in 1964 as President of Zaire, during which he acknowledged Canada's support in maintaining his country's territorial integrity.\n\nEthiopian troops were among the first 3,500 UN soldiers who had arrived by 20 July 1960. The initial 460 troops from Ethiopia later to grow into the Tekil Brigade. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie raised some 3,000 Imperial Bodyguard personnel - about 10 percent of the Ethiopian Army's entire strength at that time - and made it part of the UN force in the Congo, along with an air force squadron. This volunteer battalion from the Imperial Bodyguard were authorized by the Emperor. The Tekil (or “Tekel”) Brigade was stationed in Stanleyville. Later, the Ethiopian 3rd Brigade provided artillery support for the attack on Kibushi in late 1962-early 1963.\n\nGhanaian, Nigerian, and Indian troops also served in ONUC, the later with 99th Infantry Brigade. The Nigerian 1st Battalion was among the last troops in the country in 1964.\n\nAn Egyptian battalion appears to have arrived by September 1960, but left by early 1961 after a dispute about the UN's role. On 26 January 1961, the Secretary-General reported that the government of the United Arab Republic (the Egyptian-Syrian union) had made an oral request that it's contingent, numbering approximately 510 officers and men, be repatriated by 1 February. It appears the contingent, a parachute battalion, was located in January 1961 at Lisala in Equateur Province, where visits of UAR Ilyushin aircraft caused concern.\n\nDuring the first three years of its operation, ONUC managed to successfully improve the internal security of the Congo. On the eve of ONUC's departure, Adoula declared over radio that the mission was a \"decisive factor\" in restoring the Congo's unity and that it set \"an encouraging precedent\" for intervention in emerging states.\n\nIn the years following the Congo Crisis, most Congolese viewed ONUC as an unwelcome foreign interference in their country's affairs.\n\nONUC was the first UN peacekeeping mission to employ force as a means of implementing the decisions of the Security Council. It was also the first mission to enforce a no-fly zone and an arms embargo.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2200571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200571", "title": "Coccidiosis", "text": "Coccidiosis\n\nCoccidiosis is a parasitic disease of the intestinal tract of animals caused by coccidian protozoa. The disease spreads from one animal to another by contact with infected feces or ingestion of infected tissue. Diarrhea, which may become bloody in severe cases, is the primary symptom. Most animals infected with coccidia are asymptomatic, but young or immunocompromised animals may suffer severe symptoms and death.\n\nWhile coccidia can infect a wide variety of animals, including humans, birds, and livestock, they are usually species-specific. One well-known exception is toxoplasmosis caused by \"Toxoplasma gondii\".\n\nHumans may first encounter coccidia when they acquire a puppy or kitten that is infected. Other than \"T. gondii\", the infectious organisms are canine and feline-specific and are not contagious to humans, unlike the zoonotic diseases.\n\nPuppies are frequently infected with coccidia from the feces of their mother, and are more likely to develop coccidiosis due to their undeveloped immune systems. Stress can trigger symptoms in susceptible animals.\n\nSymptoms in young dogs include diarrhea with mucus and blood, poor appetite, vomiting, and dehydration. Untreated the disease can be fatal. They can also show signs of aggressive humping or sexual activity during this time.\n\nTreatment is routine and effective. Diagnosis is made by low-powered microscopic examination of the feces, which is generally replete with oocysts. If found in feces, the affected animal must go through months of treatment. Readily available drugs eliminate the protozoa or reduce them enough that the animal's immune system can clear the infection. Permanent damage to the gastrointestinal system is rare, and a dog will usually suffer no long-lasting negative effects. It is important too, however, to keep track of your dog's movements and actions.\n\nCoccidiosis is a significant disease for chickens, especially affecting the young chicks. It can be fatal or leave the bird with compromised digestion. There are chick feed mixes that contain a coccidiostat to manage exposure levels and control disease. In an outbreak, coccidiocidal medications are given. Examples are toltrazuril (Baycox) or amprolium. After multiple infections, surviving chickens become resistant to the coccidia.\n\nCoccidiosis (in cattle also known as Eimeriosis) is one of the most important diseases in calves and youngstock both under housing conditions and when grazing. Symptoms are generally caused by the species \"Eimeria zuernii\" and \"Eimeria bovis\" and include loss of appetite, fatigue, dehydration, and watery, sometimes bloody, diarrhea. Outbreaks are known to occur in cattle herds. The parasite can infect all animals on the farm and in some countries the parasite is present on all farms. Coccidiosis affects the growth and sometimes survival of the calves and consequently affect the production and the profitability of cattle livestock production.\n\nCoccidiosis is also present in goats, and is the largest cause of diarrhea in young goats. It can also greatly affect sexual reproduction of goats.\n\n\nThe most common medications used to treat coccidian infections are in the sulfonamide antibiotic family.\n\nDepending on the pathogen and the condition of the animal, untreated coccidiosis may clear of its own accord, or become severe and damaging, and sometimes cause death. This can also lead to the disruption of sucking of the Mom and sexual reproduction will cease or decrease.\n"}

From 1969 to 2019, it hosted the RBC Heritage on the PGA Tour, usually in mid-April, the week after The Masters.\n\nHarbour Town Golf Links is ranked high among golf courses in America by \"Golf Digest\" and \"Golf Magazine\". The course consists of narrow fairways, overhanging oaks, pines, palmettos, and dark lagoons. Harbour Town, along with the Atlantic Dunes (formerly known as \"Ocean Course\") and Heron Point, make up the Sea Pines Resort.\n\nHarbour Town Golf Links was designed by Pete Dye in 1967 with the help of professional golfer Jack Nicklaus. Dye also designed another course in the Sea Pines Resort, Heron Point, which he redesigned in 2007. The course is open all year, even during overseeding in October and the aerating of the greens in June, July, and August.\n\nGreen fees for public play range from $195 to $369, depending on the season. An estimated 38,000 rounds of golf are played at Harbour Town every year.\n\nThe holes at Harbour Town Golf Links consist of seven different types of grass. Five of the grass types, four of which are Bermudas, are able to withstand the heat during the warm summer months of Hilton Head Island. The other two grass types are annually overseeded in October in order to keep the course green during the cold months. The rye grass that is planted in October is only temporary and will eventually die out when the weather warms up, and the Bermuda grass is no longer dormant. The fairways and rough consist of 419 Bermuda grass.\n\nThe tee boxes are made up of Celebration Bermuda as well as TifSports Bermuda. The fairways, rough, and tee boxes are overseeded with rye grass in October. Several tee boxes are composed of Empire Zoysia which does not become dormant (brown) in the winter. These Zoysia tee boxes do not need do be overseeded. Harbour Town Golf Link's greens consist of TifEagle Bermuda which is overseeded with Poa Trivialis in October. The course superintendent, Jonathan Wright, is in charge of maintaining the different types of grass.\n\n\"Golf Digest\" ranked Harbour Town the 2011-2012 #21 ranked public course in America after previously being ranked #13 in 2010.\n\nPGA Tour professionals rated Harbour Town the #2 ranked golf course played on tour in a survey performed by Golf Digest.\n\n\"Golf Magazine\" rates Harbour Town the 2012 #12 rated public course in America. In 2010, it was ranked #14 in the country by Golf Magazine.\n\nHarbour Town Golf Links is a par 71 course and from the back tees, relatively short for a PGA Tour event; most are on courses that average . For its inaugural tour event in 1969, the course was set at . It has slick and firm Bermuda grass greens that are small in size; they average in area, while the average on tour is .\n\nSeveral holes have a very small margin of error between greens and water hazards (4, 8, 14, 17, 18). Tee shots and lay-ups must be placed in the strategic part of fairway in order to have a direct shot into the green. Sometimes golfers get blocked out by overhanging trees, even if they are in the fairway. Holes in which players may be blocked out from the fairway include numbers 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16. Compared to other courses Harbour Town has high percentage of holes with this challenge.\n\nThe ninth hole is a tight par 4 that can be reached from the tee with a long drive. It normally plays around , tempting golfers to go for a small green guarded by bunkers. The two finishing holes are along Calibogue Sound, so the water line can vary due to changing tides. The hazard line is permanent, but shots can be played off the sand at low tide. On the final two holes, wind off the water must be factored. The seventeenth hole, a par three, plays southwest and usually into a headwind. The eighteenth is the signature hole and heads northward; its entire left side is guarded by the sound and the right is lined with out of bounds stakes. The red-and-white-striped Harbour Town lighthouse is a backdrop, often a good target for approach shots to the green.\n\nFrom 1969 to 2019, Harbour Town Golf Links hosted the RBC Heritage on the PGA Tour, held in April the weekend following the Masters Tournament. Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) now sponsors the golf tournament after Verizon discontinued their sponsorship of the event following the 2010 event. It is the only PGA Tour event that is annually held in South Carolina. The PGA Championship was played at the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island in 2012, won by Rory McIlroy.\n\nThe inaugural tournament, \"The Heritage Golf Classic,\" was held in late November 1969, with a winner's share of Forty-year-old Arnold Palmer claimed the first victory in 1969 with 283 (–1) on November 30, his first win in over The Heritage Classic, undergoing several different official names, has been held at Harbour Town annually since 1969. The founder of Sea Pines, Charles E. Fraser, started the tradition of the Heritage Classic, and the tournament is always started with a ceremonial tee shot into Calibogue Sound by the defending champion; a cannon is fired simultaneously as the ball is struck.\n\nPGA Tour professionals rated the course #2 in a \"Golf Digest\" survey named \"Top 10 PGA Tour Courses\" in 2012, behind only Augusta National, ranked the world's greatest golf course by \"Golf Digest\".\n\nHarbour Town offers a different sort of challenge than most of the courses played on tour; the course plays different due to the short yardage and tight fairways. Most courses played on tour are much longer in yardage but have a wider margin of error off the tee and through the green. Strategically placed oaks, pines, and palmettos line and overhang the slim fairways. Professionals will sometimes find themselves having no direct shot to the green even from their own fairway. Tee shots have to be placed on the ideal side of the fairway in order to win the tournament. Another challenging aspect of the course is from the small and slick Bermuda greens. Breaks are subtle and tricky to read as a result of the grain present in the Bermuda grass. Lagoons and inner coastal waterways edge up to the greens forcing players to take more conservative shots.\n\nWinning scores vary considerably from year to year because of the different challenges. Tour players may take advantage of the short yardages and having wedge shots into the greens, but at the same time run the risk of finding themselves in the thick trees with no shot or in a water hazard. The record low score at The Heritage is by Brian Gay in 2009, with a victory margin of ten shots. Champions now win a prize of over $1.2 million, as well as the traditional tartan plaid jacket.\n\nThe tournament was discontinued after the 2019 tournament, but officials hope to resume it in 2021.\n\n"}

Ryan won 26 Grand Slam titles, 19 in women's doubles and mixed doubles at Wimbledon, an all-time record for those two events. Twelve of her Wimbledon titles were in women's doubles and seven were in mixed doubles. Ryan also won four women's doubles titles at the French Championships, as well as one women's doubles title and two mixed-doubles titles at the U.S. Championships.\n\nAlthough she reached the Wimbledon singles finals twice, Ryan never won the title. Eight of her losses at Wimbledon were to players generally considered to be among the best ever. Ryan had to play Dorothea Lambert Chambers in the all-comers final of 1920; Suzanne Lenglen in the 1919 semifinals (losing 6–4, 7–5), 1921 final, 1922 quarterfinals, 1924 quarterfinals (losing 6–2, 6–8, 6–4), and 1925 second round; and Helen Wills Moody in the 1928 semifinals and 1930 final.\n\nIn the 1926 singles final at the U.S. Championships, the 34-year-old Ryan led 42-year-old Molla Bjurstedt Mallory 4–6, 6–4, 4–0 and had a match point at 7–6 in the third set before losing the final three games of the match.\n\nRyan and her longtime partner Lenglen never lost a women's doubles match at Wimbledon, going 31–0. Only Billie Jean King (224 match wins) and Martina Navratilova won more matches at Wimbledon than Ryan (190 match wins): 47–15 in singles, 73–4 in women's doubles, and 70–9 in mixed doubles.\n\nThe longtime tennis writer Ted Tinling has credited Ryan with inventing the volleying style later perfected by players such as Sarah Palfrey Cooke, Alice Marble, Louise Brough Clapp, Margaret Osborne duPont, Doris Hart, Darlene Hard, Margaret Court, Navratilova, and King. \"Before World War I, women's tennis consisted primary of slogging duels from the baseline. There were a few volleying pioneers, notably ... Hazel [Hotchkiss] Wightman and Ethel [Thomson] Larcombe, but volleying as a fundamental, aggressive technique was first injected into the women's game by ... Ryan.\" Tinling, however, also said about Ryan, \"Elizabeth wasn't fast enough for singles. Too heavy.\"\n\nAccording to Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, Ryan was ranked in the world top ten from 1921 (when the rankings began) through 1928 and again in 1930, reaching a career high of world No. 3 in those rankings in 1927. Ryan was ranked second behind Mallory in the year-end rankings issued by the United States Lawn Tennis Association for 1925 and 1926.\n\nRyan died on July 6, 1979, at age 87, on the grounds of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Wimbledon, following the ladies singes final and the day before Billie Jean King broke her record number of Wimbledon wins by winning her 20th title. When tennis writer and television commentator Bud Collins tried to arrange for Ryan and King to film an interview together at Wimbledon in 1979, Ryan refused. King said, \"I always liked seeing Miss Ryan at Wimbledon, and I'd try to be friendly, but she didn't seem to want it. For me, it wasn't personal. Sure, I wanted the record, but I wasn't trying to steal a possession of hers.\" King also said, \"[T]here is no doubt in my mind that she just didn't want to be alive to see her record broken. She was [87], she had held it for a long, long time and she wanted it for herself.

His smuggling operation began in the late 1960s, when he teamed up with a group of college friends from Tahoe Paradise College. At first, they only sold marijuana at their college, but soon the business grew. When authorities moved in on their growing operation at a small farm in Clay County, Kansas, they began importing marijuana from Mexico. Later Mancuso teamed up with a Thai exchange student to import more potent marijuana into San Francisco. Mancuso soon realized that there was more profit to be made selling cocaine and integrated it into his marijuana operation. \n\nIt took the government twelve years to build a case against Mancuso. Anthony White, assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Nevada, brought charges against Mancuso in 1990 and it was hailed as one of the largest drug conspiracy cases in state history. The indictment alleged that Mancuso used a multi-state cocaine and marijuana smuggling operation to buy ranches, mountaintop retreats, beach-front estates and anything else he might want.\n\nMancuso was sentenced to nine years in prison on June 27, 1995. His sentence was greatly reduced because of his cooperation with the government in cases against other alleged organization members and Mancuso's lawyer Patrick Hallinan. As a result of his assistance to the government, Mancuso was allowed to keep $5 million in proceeds from his trafficking business.

The state of Volga Bulgaria grew up during the Middle Ages and for a time was subject to the Khazars. The Volga Bulgars became Muslim and incorporated various Turkic peoples to form the modern Volga Tatar ethnic group.\n\nThe region came under the domination of the Khanate of Kazan in the 15th century. The khanate was conquered by Ivan the Terrible in 1552 and abolished in 1708. This period was marked by settlement of the area by Russians and attempts at conversion to Orthodox Christianity, provoking a number of rebellions among the Tatars and neighbouring groups. In the late 18th and 19th centuries industry developed, economic conditions improved and Tatars achieved more equal status with Russians. However, Tatar national consciousness was growing, and upon the October Revolution of 1917, national institutions were established and independence declared as the Idel-Ural State. After several years of civil war the Soviet government suppressed independence and established the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union. \n\nUnder Soviet rule there was a famine followed by progressive decline of the Tatar language, culture and religion both Christian and Muslim. The discovery of large petroleum deposits helped to promote further major growth in industry. Around the time of the fall of the USSR in 1991 there were again moves for independence, but in 1994 the region, under the name of Tatarstan, became a constituent republic of the Russian Federation. In 2008 a national assembly, the \"Milli Mejlis\", declared Tatarstan independent, but this status has not been recognised by the United Nations or the Russian government.\n\nHuman habitation in Tatarstan dates back to the Palaeolithic period. Remains of several cultures of the Stone and Bronze Ages have been discovered within Tatarstan.\n\nDuring the Iron Age (8th century BCE – 3rd century CE), the Ananyino culture, probably a Finno-Ugrian people, dominated the area of the upper Volga and Kama river valleys. From the middle of the 1st millennium BC western Tatarstan was occupied by the Gorodets culture.\n\nFrom the 4th century BCE much of the Volga–Kama basin was occupied by tribes of the İmänkiskä culture, who are thought to have been related to the Scythians, speakers of one of the Indo-European languages. Around the beginning of the 1st century CE a new group, the so-called Pyanobor culture (probably of Finnic origin) appeared at the lower Kama.\n\nDuring the great migrations of late antiquity Siberian Turkic and Ugric tribes settled the region east of the middle Volga and forced out the Pyanobor culture from the Kama basin. The Pyanobor tribes lingered on in what are now the north and north-western parts of Tatarstan.\n\nThe period from roughly 500 to 700 CE saw an influx of Turkic-speaking nomads. These immigrants' culture was related to those of the Göktürks, Khazars and the tribes of Great Bulgaria.\n\nThe 9th and 10th centuries saw the rise of the first organized state in the region, the Khanate of the Volga Bulgars. The population of Volga Bulgaria was largely agricultural. The cities of Bolghar, Bilär, and Suar, among others, appeared with the growth of industry (casting, forging) and trade. Crop-growing and a cattle-breeding played a major role in the economy. The farmers were predominantly free landowners.\n\nIn the early 10th century the Volga Bulgars converted to Islam, causing their culture to be greatly influenced by that of the Muslim Middle East.\n\nAfter the conquest of Volga Bulgaria by Mongol troops under Batu Khan the country was under the control of the khans of the Golden Horde. As a result of the admixing of different Turkic peoples and languages to the Volga Bolgars during this period, the modern Volga Tatar ethnos emerged.\n\nIn the first half of the 15th century, as the result of Golden Horde's collapse, the Khanate of Kazan emerged as the dominant power in the Volga–Kama region. As Muscovy grew in power and struggled for control of trade routes and territory with the Golden Horde's successor states, Kazan was at times dominated by factions favorable to Moscow, and at other times by factions advocating alliance with other Tatar polities such as the Crimean Khanate. Finally, the khanate was conquered by Ivan the Terrible in 1552.\n\nAfter 1552 the khanate was governed by Kazan Palace's Office formed in Moscow. In 1555 a bishop was appointed in Kazan with a mandate to baptize the Idel-Ural peoples. Many churches and monasteries were built, and Russian peasants and craftsmen were resettled within Tatarstan. At the same time ethnic Tatars were removed from Kazan proper as well as regions close to rivers and roads. Under pressure from the Russians many Tatars emigrated to the Upper Kama, Trans-Kama area, Bashkortostan, the Urals and Siberia during the 16th and 17th centuries. The result was a decline in agriculture, industry and commerce throughout the region. The local population was forced to pay the yasaq tax. Some part of the Tatar nobility were included in the nobility of the Russian Empire; many underwent baptism to keep their privileges.\n\nIn 1708, the Khanate of Kazan was abolished and the province was placed under the control of a new Kazan Governorate. It included Middle Volga and Western Urals. Kazan, with 20,000 citizens, was one of major trade and handicraft centers of Russia. Manufacturing developed and in the beginning of 19th century major hide, soap and candle factories appeared. A class of Tatar merchants arose, who carried on brisk trade with Central Asia.\n\nRestrictions in occupation, heavy taxation, and discrimination against non-Christians blocked the cultural and economic development of the Tatars. Several rebellions and peasants' wars broke out as a result. During the Time of Troubles, the Kazan khanate regained its independence with the aid of factions within the Russian army. Cangali bek, a Tatar nobleman, led another revolution in 1616. Other insurrections among the Volga Tatars included the Bolotnikov movement (1606–1607), Batırşa movement (1755–1756), and Pugachev's war (1773–1775). Other peoples of the Idel-Ural region took part in these conflicts.\n\nIn 1773, Muslims in Russia were granted greatly expanded rights. In 1784 Tatar noblemen (\"morzalar\") had equal rights with Russian noblemen (\"dvoryane\").\n\nTatar soldiers took part in all Russian wars, sometimes in national units (as was the case during the Napoleonic Wars).\n\nAfter the reforms of the 1860s in Imperial Russia economic conditions in Tatarstan improved markedly. Stolypin's reforms led to accelerated economic development of the rural areas. In the 19th century a large middle class developed among the Tatars. The Russian Revolution of 1905 awakened Tatar national consciousness and led to calls for equal rights, development of a distinct national culture and national self-consciousness as well as other freedoms. The pan-Islamic Russian party \"Ittifaq al-Muslimin\" represented the growing nationalist camp within the State Duma. The first Tatar mass-media appeared during this period with the publication of Tatar language newspapers such as \"\"Yoldız\", \"Waqıt\", \"Azat\", \"Azat xalıq\", \"İrek\", \"Tañ yoldızı\", \"Nur\", \"Fiker\", \"Ural\", \"Qazan möxbire\", \"Älğäsrelcädid\", \"Şura\", \"Añ\"\", and \"\"Mäktäp\"\". The first Tatar professional theatre, the \"Säyyär\" also emerged at this time.\n\n\nDuring the chaos of the Russian Revolutions of 1917, Tatarstan became functionally independent with a national parliament (Millät Mäclese), national government (Milli İdarä), national council (Milli Şura), and a national military council (Xärbi Şura). Some Tatar military units took part in the Russian Civil War against the communists. Anti-communist Tatar revolutionaries declared the Idel-Ural State, but the Moscow Bolshevist government moved to prevent an independent Tatarstan on its flank. The \"Muslim Council\" was overthrown by a \"Workers' Bolshevik Council\" in a mostly Tatar-populated part of Kazan province called \"Bolaq artı\" or \"Zabulachye\" (In English, the \"Transbolaqia Republic\"). The Muslim Council was arrested.\n\nIn August 1918, the White Czechs and KomUch forces reached Kazan, but retreated under the Red pressure.\n\nIn 1919 the Bolsheviks declared an autonomous Tatar-Bashkir Soviet Socialist Republic, but the region was at the time largely occupied by the White Army, the leader of whom, General Kolchak, did not support an independent Muslim republic. The declaration, coupled with Kolchak's hostility, caused many Tatar and Bashkir troops to switch sides and fight for the Bolsheviks. Ultimately, the victorious Communists subsumed Tatarstan within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), leading to large-scale emigration from the country, particularly among the upper class.\n\nThe Russian Civil War ended in Tatarstan with the suppression of the anti-communist peasant Pitchfork Uprising in March 1920. As a result of war communism policy the 1921-1922 Famine in Tatarstan had begun and annihilated nearly half a million people.\n\nOn 27 May 1920 the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (TASSR) of the RSFSR was declared. However, in the late 1920s the Soviet government under Joseph Stalin began to place restrictions on the use of the Tatar language (among many other minority languages in the Soviet Union). The development of national culture declined significantly. The Tatar alphabet was switched twice (to the Latin alphabet and then to Cyrillic). From the 1930s through the 1950s, Tatar-language press, cultural institutions, theatres, national schools and institutes gradually disappeared, as education was required to be conducted in the Russian language. Industrialization, the rise of the collective farms kolektivizatsiya and persecutions such as the Great Purge contributed to this decline.\n\nReligion was also repressed. At first, Soviet rule favored mostly the Eastern Orthodox Church, and some Islamic religious streams were preserved (see Jadidism, Wäisi movement), but later they also were repressed. Some theologians of Jadidism (which was liberal to Soviet rule at first) escaped to Turkey or Egypt.\n\nMore than 560,000 Tatarstan soldiers took part in World War II and more than 300,000 of them were killed. Many Soviet plants and their workers, as well as the Soviet Academy of Sciences, were evacuated to Tatarstan. During the war large petroleum deposits were discovered. During their exploration, Tatarstan became one of the most industrially developed regions of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1960s-1970s Tatar ASSR's industry was developed not only in the petrol sector; a major car plant, KamAZ was built in Naberezhnye Chelny, making this city become the second largest in the republic. Other major cities, built and developed in those years are Nizhnekamsk and Almetyevsk.\n\nThe Supreme Council of TASSR changed Tatarstan's status on 30 August 1990 and a declaration of sovereignty of the Tatarstan Soviet Socialistic Republic was made.\n\nOn December 20, 2008, in response to Russia recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Milli Mejlis of the Tatar People declared Tatarstan independent and asked for United Nations recognition. However this declaration was ignored both by the United Nations and the Russian government.\n\n"}

They played five One-day Internationals (ODIs), two Test matches and one Twenty20 International. They also played one One Day International against Ireland, which they won easily. They won two of the three ODIs, and were also looking to win the third, but a good last over from Katherine Brunt, yielding only four runs, gave England victory. Brunt was also the heroine of the second Test, where she took nine wickets in the match and made 52 in England's first Test win over the Australians since December 1984. It also gave England their first win in the Women's Ashes since 1963. England also won their next ODI thanks to a century from Claire Taylor, but Australia took the series 3–2 after winning the last ODI by just four runs. The last match of the series was a Twenty20 International, which was Australia's first, and they won it by seven wickets.\n\nThree ODIs in Ireland were planned (29, 31 July and 1 August), but only one was actually played - the other two were rained off. However, in the match that was played on 31 July, Australia beat the Irish women's cricket team by 240 runs, Karen Rolton and Lisa Sthalekar both making centuries as Australia made 295 for 3, and Cecelia Joyce top-scored for Ireland with a paltry 18 - Shelley Nitschke taking four for 15 as Ireland collapsed to 55 all out in 26 overs.\n\nEngland got an excellent start to the first women's Test at Hove, where two debutants were to take centre stage; but the match petered out into a draw.\n\nIn one of the highlights of the first day of play, Belinda Clark – arguably Australia's best batter – had been bowled by Jenny Gunn for a two-ball duck. It was to be Gunn's only wicket of the day, but probably the most vital. All-rounder Rosalie Birch and 15-year-old debutante spinner Holly Colvin then took two wickets each as Australia crumbled to 115 for 7, Karen Rolton being the only batter on top of the bowlers.\n\nHowever, as the day wore on, England lost their stamina, and the lower order batters took over. No. 7 Cathryn Fitzpatrick, No. 9 Julie Hayes and Test debutante No. 10 Shelley Nitschke all made fifties as Australia eked out 223 more runs before the end of the first day, losing only two more wickets, and Nitschke was 70 not out overnight. She finished on an unbeaten 81, as Australia added a further 27 before Clea Smith was lbw to Katherine Brunt, to end with 355. England scored slowly after losing Laura Newton for 24, as they used 129 overs to make 273 – Charlotte Edwards top-scoring with 69, while Arran Brindle made her second Test half-century with 54.\n\nNitschke and Lisa Sthalekar took three wickets each, but England fought back. Gunn took two more wickets, removing both openers for ducks, as Belinda Clark recorded a pair, but Karen Rolton and Sthalekar took the score beyond England's grasp. Rolton was finally run out for 97, but she had led the Australians to a 254-run lead at the end of day three. Australia added a further 51 to that on the fourth morning - slow left arm bowler Clare Connor taking four for 68 in a marathon bowling effort. England quickly determined 306 in 95 overs was too tough after they crumbled to 14 for 3, but Brindle stood firm at the crease, taking four hours for a maiden Test century, and England made it to the end of the scheduled time having only lost seven wickets. Thus, the second Test would now decide the series.\n\nDespite rain washing out parts of the first day at New Road, England took their first Test victory over Australia since December 1984, and their first Ashes series win since 1963. Having won the toss, England captain Clare Connor opted to bowl, and after Belinda Clark had slashed 18 runs she was trapped lbw by pacer Katherine Brunt. Wickets were shared out among the entire England team, no Australian passed 40, and by the end of the day they had crashed to 126 for 7. It took 33 deliveries for Australia to be all out on the second morning - for 131, as the efforts from the last Test, when the last three wickets outscored the rest of the batting line-up, were not repeated. Brunt took care of that, having Nitschke and Price caught behind to complete her five-wicket-haul. Batting was clearly difficult, but Jenny Gunn, Clare Connor and Claire Taylor all dug in to make scores above 30, before a vital partnership between Taylor and Beth Morgan took England to a relatively comfortable lead, as they moved to 196 for 6 before Emma Liddell struck twice and Cathryn Fitzpatrick once to leave England at 222 for 9 at close of play of day two. Liddell and Fitzpatrick bowled 59 overs between them on the second day, out of a total of 101, and although they shared seven wickets, they failed to remove either of Brunt or Isa Guha, and the last English pair added 18 before the end of day two.\n\nOn the third day, England powered on, Brunt staking her claim for Player of the Match with a vital, powerful 52 - her first Test fifty - as she eked out 83 runs with Guha for the tenth wicket, Guha making 31 not out. Leading by 158 on first innings, England got a dream start by dismissing Lisa Keightley for a duck, and wickets just kept falling. Gunn and Brunt took two wickets each as the Australians faltered to 18 for 4, before the twin sisters Kate and Alex Blackwell fought back. However, Isa Guha removed Alex, another two wickets fell, and by tea Australia were 67 for 7. An attritional partnership for the seventh wicket between Kate Blackwell and Shelley Nitschke, which yielded 112 runs in four hours, carried Australia past 100, but still they were only 21 ahead with three wickets in hand at the close of day three. The last day started just like England wanted, Katherine Brunt dismissing Kate Blackwell and wicket-keeper Julia Price with successive deliveries, and all that was left was to take the last wicket. England toiled, but the Australians defended for nearly two hours and faced 35 overs, until number 11 Emma Liddell finally edged behind to Jane Smit and was out for 24. Shelley Nitschke made her second fifty in two Tests and was left stranded on 88 not out, while slow left arm bowler Clare Connor ended with the bowling analysis of 26-20-25-1. Brunt finished with four wickets in the second innings, for a match total of nine for 111.\n\nEngland were thus left to chase 75 for the Ashes, but Emma Liddell did not want to be beaten, and her pace trapped Laura Newton and Jenny Gunn lbw in the second over as England lost their first two wickets for one run. However, Liddell could not make any further breakthroughs, and even though England lost Connor and Edwards to Fitzpatrick - both lbw - Arran Brindle batted out an hour for 24 not out to see England to the target about three hours before the scheduled close.\n\nEngland set themselves up well against Australia, but failed to hit out in the last over thanks to some accurate and fierce bowling from Cathryn Fitzpatrick, who had earlier hit 38 not out with the bat to lift Australia to 222 for 7 after three for 39 from Clare Connor. Arran Brindle continued on her magnificent form from the first Test, when she made a fifty and a hundred, and in partnerships with Jenny Gunn and Claire Taylor she lifted the English to 198 for 4 with her score of 81. With only 25 runs left to hit for the last six wickets, it was there for the taking. But Fitzpatrick returned, having taken the wicket of Laura Newton earlier on, and she took three more wickets as the English lower order were strangled - and collapsed to 210 all out with five balls remaining in the innings. Fitzpatrick ended with figures of four for 19 from 10 overs, and Emma Liddell also took three for 29.\n\nSlow left arm bowler Shelley Nitschke bowled Australia to a win and a 2–0 series lead in the second match of the ODI series, after good bowling from the English women had limited Australia to 193 for 8 in 50 overs. Kate Blackwell and Lisa Keightley both made fifties for Australia, while Belinda Clark continued her poor run of form - two ducks in the Tests and 16 in the first ODI was followed up with a 45-ball 10 today. England wicket-keeper Claire Taylor made three stumpings, two off medium pace bowler Isa Guha. England's reply started well, with Laura Newton and Claire Taylor making their way to 80 for 1 after Charlotte Edwards had been dismissed initially, but the English bowler just couldn't play the spin of Nitschke, who recorded a career-best analysis of 7 for 24, despite six wides. Only Newton and Taylor passed 10, while Arran Brindle's good form (with 236 runs in three innings so far in the series) came to a halt as she was bowled by Nitschke for a golden duck. England's final score was 128 all out, with more than 10 overs potentially remaining in the innings.\n\nEngland needed a victory to keep the five-match One-day International series alive, and with Australia needing six runs off the last over, it looked like the Australians would secure the series with two matches to spare. However, Katherine Brunt had the last say, as she first had Cathryn Fitzpatrick stumped and then helped to run out Julie Hayes for a duck. Suddenly, Australia needed four from the last ball to win, and they could only get one, as England went into scenes of jubilation - having secured their first victory over the Australian women since 1993. Earlier, Claire Taylor had lifted England to 200 for 7 with her 82, taking on Fitzpatrick who conceded 61 runs in her 10 overs. All the six Australian bowlers got one wicket, however, with the seventh being a run out. Australia's opener Belinda Clark recorded another poor score with a six-ball duck, and Australia continued to lose wickets at regular intervals. Yet, at 195 for 5 with an over to spare, the wise money would normally have been on the tourists, but thanks to Brunt, it went England's way instead.\n\nEngland won by four wickets\n\nEngland, buoyed by having won their first Ashes Test series in 42 years, tied the series at 2–2 with a victory at The County Ground, Taunton. Australia, however, made a good start with Lisa Keightley and Karen Rolton making fifties to propel the team to 142 for 1. Two quick wickets from Clare Connor slowed them down, however, and they finished with a total on 215 for 5. Chasing that total, England lost Charlotte Edwards for 1 in the second over, but Laura Newton and Claire Taylor put them back with a 65-run partnership. Spinner Lisa Sthalekar then took two quick wickets, and England were set back to 79 for 3 after 19.3 overs. Despite two maiden overs from left-arm bowler Karen Rolton, Taylor kept hitting boundaries, ending with 116 before finally letting a ball from Cathryn Fitzpatrick onto her stumps - bowled for 116. By that time, though, she had made the first century of the series, and England only needed five more runs to win. Lydia Greenway and Jane Smit carried England over the target with nine balls to spare, setting up the fifth and final match, also at Taunton, to be a series decider.\n\nAustralia won by four runs\n\nEngland's run of victories - with three, their longest successive streak of wins over Australia - came to an end at The County Ground, Taunton as Australia recorded their first win in four matches against the English. It was another close bout, with the match result uncertain till the very last over. Australia batted first, and made 260 for 6, with Lisa Keightley, Karen Rolton and Lisa Sthalekar all making fifties, and Belinda Clark recording her highest score of the tour with 36. Leg-spinner Charlotte Edwards took three for 47 to set Australia back somewhat in the late overs, however.\n\nWhen England batted, Edwards shared an opening partnership of 94 with Laura Newton, and both made half-centuries as England paced themselves well, keeping the required run rate just around six per over. However, fast bowler Cathryn Fitzpatrick took four wickets to trouble the English middle order, having Arran Brindle bowled for 50 to see England to 240 for 6. England only needed 20 for the last four wickets, and with England's captain Clare Connor hitting a couple of fours after being forced down the order, England needed six off the last over to win with one wicket in hand - having suffered two run outs as well. Isa Guha hit the first ball for a single, bringing Connor on strike with five needed. However, Kirsten Pike held a catch off Connor's top-edge, and England were all out for 256, five short of their first ODI series victory over Australia since 1976.\n\nAustralia won by seven wickets\n\nCathryn Fitzpatrick, playing her last international match in England, combined with Karen Rolton to be the main reasons for Australia a comfortable victory in the second women's Twenty20 international of all time. England batted first, and Charlotte Edwards and Laura Newton added 77 for the first wicket, but when Newton and Edwards departed England began to struggle. Fitzpatrick's economical bowling yielded only 14 runs from four overs, including a maiden over to Rosalie Birch (who made one run off seven balls in the last three balls). Some boundaries in the late overs from Clare Connor and Katherine Brunt, however, saw England to a total of 151 for 7.\n\nBrunt then took three early wickets for England as Australia faltered to six runs for three wickets, and England's hopes were increasing. No one could support Brunt with the ball, however, and Karen Rolton slashed 16 fours and one six in an unbeaten 96 to guide Australia home with fourteen deliveries remaining. Kate Blackwell supported her well, making 43, and no one except Brunt could keep the run rate below 8 an over.\n"}

Depending on the manner of formation, soil crusts can be biological or physical. Biological soil crusts are formed by communities of microorganisms that live on the soil surface whereas physical crusts are formed by physical impact such as that of raindrops.\n\nBiological soil crusts are communities of living organisms on the soil surface in arid- and semi-arid ecosystems. They are found throughout the world with varying species composition and cover depending on topography, soil characteristics, climate, plant community, microhabitats, and disturbance regimes. Biological soil crusts perform important ecological roles including carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, soil stabilization, alter soil albedo and water relations, and affect germination and nutrient levels in vascular plants. They can be damaged by fire, recreational activity, grazing, and other disturbance and can require long time periods to recover composition and function. Biological soil crusts are also known as cryptogamic, microbiotic, microphytic, or cryptobiotic soils.\n\nPhysical (as opposed to biological) soil crusts results from raindrop or trampling impacts. They are often hardened relative to uncrusted soil due to the accumulation of salts and silica. These can coexist with biological soil crusts, but have different ecological impact due to their difference in formation and composition. Physical soil crusts often reduce water infiltration, can inhibit plant establishment, and when disrupted can be eroded rapidly.\n\n"}

Settling in Manitoba, Canada, in 1912, he became a well known Canadian fiction writer exploring Western prairie pioneer life in vibrant multi-cultural communities. A bigamist, Grove constructed his entire life as an intricate web of fact and fiction. He died in 1948 on his estate in Simcoe, Ontario, where he had resided since 1930.\n\nGrove was born Felix Paul Greve in Radomno, West Prussia, but was brought up in Hamburg where he graduated with the \"Abitur\" from the Gymnasium Johanneum in 1898. After studying classical languages and archaeology in Bonn, he became a prolific translator of world literature and a member of Stefan George's homoerotic group, the \"George-Kreis\", around 1900. During his year in Munich, he befriended Karl Wolfskehl, and briefly shared an address with Thomas Mann at the Pension Gisels from August to September 1902. In early 1903, amidst scandal, he settled in Palermo, Italy, with Else Plötz Endell, the wife of renowned architect August Endell (she would later become Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven). In his 1946 autobiography \"In Search of Myself\", Grove suggests that despite the homoerotic context of his work up to late 1902, his first sexual encounter with Elsa determined his sexuality: \"If I had not always been so, I had become definitely, finally heterosexual.\"\n\nGrove's rising career took a dramatic downward spin that followed his alliance with Else. Unable to repay loans made by his intimate friend and wealthy patron Herman Kilian, he was promptly charged and convicted of fraud; from 1903–04, he served a deeply humiliating one-year sentence in the penitentiary in Bonn, leaving his reputation destroyed. Much suggests that Kilian (whose Anglo-German ancestry Grove would later appropriate for himself in his Canadian autobiographies) had acted from motives of jealousy. While in prison, Grove composed his first novel, \"Fanny Essler\", a thinly veiled \"roman à clef\" about Else's sexual adventures, including her marriage with August Endell. The novel, which moreover poked fun at the Stefan George circle, prompted a complete break from George's coterie. From 1904 to early 1906, the pair lived in voluntary exile, first in Wollerau, Switzerland, then in Paris-Plage, France, from where Grove paid H. G. Wells a few visits in his Sandhurst villa just across the Channel. In 1906, the couple returned to Berlin, where they were married on August 22, 1907.\n\nBy 1909, Grove was again in deep financial trouble, having double-sold his latest German translation, Jonathan Swift's \"Prosa Werke\" in four volumes. With his wife's help, he staged his suicide and departed for North America on the White Star Line's \"SS Megantic\" in late July 1909. His wife joined him a year later in Pittsburgh, and the couple farmed near Sparta, Kentucky, until 1911, when Grove left her permanently. She modeled for artists in nearby Cincinnati, and later became well known in New York dada circles as the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven after her marriage in 1913 to the German Baron Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven. Grove moved west and stayed on a large Bonanza farm near Fargo (based on the Amenia & Sharon Land Company) in the late summer of 1912.\n\nIn 1912 Grove, whose legal name was still Greve, arrived in Manitoba, Canada, where he changed his name to Frederick Philip Grove and married a young schoolteacher, Catherine Wiens, on August 2, 1914. There are no records of a divorce from his first wife, who details in her memoir that he had suddenly deserted her. He first taught in rural areas, such as Haskett, Winkler, Virden, and Gladstone, but after settling in Rapid City in 1922, he devoted himself entirely to his writing career. In 1927, Grove and his wife suffered the devastating loss of their only child, Phyllis May, shortly before her twelfth birthday. In 1928–29, Grove went on three coast-to-coast lecture tours, before the couple moved to Ontario in the fall of 1929. There, their son, Arthur Leonard Grove, was born on October 14, 1930. Grove briefly became an editor with Graphic Publishers, who had published his first autobiographical novel, \"A Search for America\", in 1927, before moving to Simcoe, Ontario. From there, he continued to write despite increasing ill-health, until he suffered a crippling stroke in late 1946. While in Simcoe, he ran for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in the 1943 Ontario general election.\n\nFrederick Philip Grove is best known for exploring the Canadian West and its pioneer landscape in non-fiction and semi-fictionalized works such as \"Over Prairie Trails\", \"Settlers of the Marsh\", \"A Search for America\", and \"In Search of Myself\". \"Grove gave a voice to the land-hungry pioneers of the West, but also cloaked his past in the ostensible honesty of the prairie pioneer novel.\"\n\nKnown for his rugged realism and naturalism, Grove created memorable pioneer characters, such as Niels Lindstedt, the hardworking and sexually naive Swedish immigrant pioneer in \"Settlers of the Marsh\" (1925); Abe Spalding, the noble but single-minded pioneer in \"Fruits of the Earth\", and John Elliot, the aging and tragic patriarch in \"Our Daily Bread\". Grove patriarchs are all strong and tragic, often lacking the words to change their fates. In contrast, Grove's female characters are survivors, verbally nimble and often assuming traditionally male roles. Most important, Grove's novels all evoke the polyglot world of immigrants.\n\nHis novels are populated with a remarkable diversity of Swedish, German, French, Icelandic, and Ukrainian immigrants, offering a vibrant multi-culturalism as a vision for Canada's social fabric. As an author he assumed the role of \"spokesperson for the young Canadian nation,\" who cleverly staged himself as \"an adopted son [in Canada]\" in lecture tours, essays, and advertisements.\n\nGrove also experimented with forms of modernism, both in staging fictionalized selves in his autobiographical fiction, and in experimenting with unreliable narrators and time shifts in his late novel, \"The Master of the Mill\".\n\nGrove's papers were acquired by the University of Manitoba (UM) from his widow Catherine Wiens in the early 1960s. This source collection fills 24 archival boxes, and contains many published and unpublished manuscripts, typescripts, and notebooks, as well as six German poems in Grove'e hand—one of which is obviously related to Greve's published poem \"Erster Sturm\" (1907). – \n\nSince the mid-1990s, the UM's FPG (Greve/Grove) & FrL Collections Website has made available numerous big & small e-texts by/about FPG and the Baroness von Freytag-Loringhoven (FrL), as well as bio-bibliographical information, notably:\n\nRelated Source- & Research Collections\n\nIn addition to the central Grove Collection Mss 2, the University of Manitoba Grove Archives have the following sources and research collections:\n\nProfessor D. O. Spettigue's Research Papers (Mss 57, 1985 & 1995, 16 Boxes) document the sensational discovery of the FPG identity in 1971. They also includethree German poems and two letters Thomas Mann sent to Grovefrom Princeton in 1939. – An additional Spettigue cluster was acquired in January 1995. It included Greve's correspondence with André Gide, Karl Wolfskehl, O. A. H. Schmitz, and contained materials related to the English translation of Greve's 1905 novel \"Fanny Essler.\" – \n\nProfessor Margaret Stobie's Collection (Mss 13, 2 Boxes) documents Grove's early teaching activities in Manitoba, and contains Grove's first Canadian publication, the sprawling article \"Rousseau als Erzieher\" in the German newspaper \"Der Nordwesten\" (Nov./Dec. 1914).\n\nDr. Gaby Divay's Research Papers (Mss 12, 8 Boxes, ongoing) contain many documents pertaining to her FPG & FrL discoveries such as: \nhttp://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~fgrove/ill_pgs/ill_sparta.html\n\nFPG Book Collections: Greve's Translations & Grove's Library\n\nThe UMA hold all of Grove's and Greve's known publications.

In 2007, they were digitized & became the Symposium's e-Proceedings.\n\nFPG & FrL Endowment (1995ff)\nA FPG & FrL Endowment Fund devoted to Greve/Grove and Freytag-Loringhoven projects was established in 1995/96. Promotional brochures, various e-text publications, and the FPG & FrL Website were all partly or entirely funded by this endowment.\n\nGrove used so many aliases that Karl Wolfskehl called him a \"Pseudologe\" and referred to his \"Munchhausiaden\".\n\nFPG: he used these initials on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nGrove: a modification of the author's real name, Greve. On the Immigration Manifesto of the White Star Liner Megantic on July 31, 1909, Grove's name was smudged, though the central vowel looks like an \"o\".\n\nFanny Essler: Joint pseudonym for F.P. Greve and Else Greve used in 1904–05, for poem published in \"Die Freistatt\".\n\nF. C. Gerden: used in correspondence with his Insel publishers for translations of decadent literature (Dowson, Browning).\n\nKonrad Thorer: used for translations of Cervantes and Lesage.\n\nAndrew R. Rutherford: a pseudonym suggested (but not used) for his first Canadian book \"Over Prairie Trails\" (1922); the name, which references Grove's friend Herman Kilian's maternal grandfather, a renowned Scottish judge, also appears in relation to his unpublished typescript in the University of Manitoba Archives, Jane Atkinson (ca. 1923, e-publ. 2000).\n\nElsa von Freytag-Loringhoven wrote a poem entitled \"Kinship,\" which is dedicated to Grove: \"Memory to F.P.G.\" In this poem, she juxtaposes the beginning and the ending of their ten-year relationship, using eroticized horseback riding as a metaphor for a highly charged journey through memory.\n\nThe Canadian heavy metal band Torture for Pleasure quote directly from Groves' novel Settlers of the Marsh in their song \"TETELESTAI (Sweet Darkness),\" released independently in 2013.\n\nD. O. Spettigue discovered Grove's identity behind a web of fiction in October 1971 in the British Museum. Uncovering Grove's prison incarceration in Germany, Spettigue published his findings in his 1973 book \"FPG: The European Years\". This monograph was followed by Paul I. Hjartarson's volume of essays, \"A Stranger to My Life\", and prompted the translation of Grove's German fiction into English, \"Fanny Essler\", and \"The Master Mason’s House\", both closely based on the life of Grove's first wife Elsa Plötz (aka The Baroness). Desmond Pacey edited \"The Letters of F.P. Grove\" in addition to publishing a monograph, \"Frederick Philip Grove\", while Margaret Stobie explored Grove's teaching years in Manitoba in her book, \"Frederick Philip Grove\".\n\nLeading later efforts to establish the identity of Greve/Grove by unearthing new biographical information and relevant records, Klaus Martens has been \"the chief pioneer\" (W.J. Keith). Exploring both the European and Canadian contexts, Martens published \"Felix Paul Greves Karriere\" (in German), \"Felix Paul Greve – André Gide\" (correspondence in English, French, and German), and \"F. P. Grove in Europe and Canada: Translated Lives\", the first well documented biography of the author in English. Martens' vast compilation \"Over Canadian Trails: F.P. Grove in New Letters and Documents\" includes the most extensive published collection of letters from and to Grove, including the Phelps correspondence, documents, many photographs, and much relevant commentary by the editor. This was preceded by Martens' \"A Dirge for My Daughter\", a careful edition of selected poems by Grove which includes photographs and reproductions of handwritten letters and notes. In addition to his Grove monographs and editions, Martens published numerous articles on both Grove and Else Plötz.\n\nIn her book \"Sexualizing Power in Naturalism: Theodore Dreiser and Frederick Philip Grove\", Irene Gammel examined the gender relationships of Grove's fiction, focussing in particular on his sexualized (and modern) female figures and the overexposed relationships of power. Gammel also traced Grove's relationship with Elsa Plötz (Baroness Elsa) in her biography \"Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada, and Everyday Modernity\", documenting that the couple had been legally married and that Grove's reasons for hiding his identity had much to do with his fear of being discovered by his former wife, the dada artist Baroness Elsa. It has also been argued, by Martens in \"Over Canadian Trails\", perhaps more persuasively, that Greve understandably changed his identity in order to escape internment as a German national at the outbreak of the Great War.\n\nIn his essay \"Felix Paul Greve, The Eulenburg Scandal, and Frederick Philip Grove,\" Richard Cavell proposed a queering approach to Grove's work, while Paul Hjartarson and Tracy Kulba's collection \"Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven and Felix Paul Greve\" assembles a range of perspectives by a number of scholars, including the editors, as well as Jutta Ernst, Klaus Martens, and Paul Morris.\n\nA great deal of research results have been provided by Dr. Gaby Divay at the University of Manitoba Archives, who also published a comprehensive edition of Grove's, Greve's and \"Fanny Essler\"s poetry in December 1993, and as an e-Edition in 2007.\n\n\nFelix Paul Greve, 1901–1909\n\nFrederick Philip Grove, 1914–1948\n\nPosthumous\n\nRelated e-Editions by/about FPG (Greve/Grove) \n\nGrove e-Editions at Gutenberg Projects\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2200732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200732", "title": "Rob Murphy", "text": "Rob Murphy\n\nRobert Albert Murphy (born May 26, 1960) is an American former professional baseball player who was a relief pitcher in Major League Baseball for eleven seasons in the 1980s and 1990s. Murphy played college baseball for the University of Florida, and was picked by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round of the 1981 Major League Baseball Draft. In addition to the Reds, he played for the Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners, Houston Astros, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and Florida Marlins.\n\nMurphy was born in Miami, Florida. He attended Christopher Columbus High School in Miami from 1974 to 1978. He pitched for the varsity baseball team in 1977 and 1978. The 1977 team won the District championship with his 4-hit shutout. He garnered many awards including: Pre-season 1st team All American, 1st team All City, and 1st team All Catholic. After setting school records for most wins (17) and strikeouts (207), he was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers. Murphy's American Legion team, Post 133, won its District Championship in 1976 with Murphy's 11 strikeout performance. Murphy also earned many accolades playing on the football field. For the CCHS Explorers' football team, Murphy was named to the 1976 All Catholic team, and 3rd team All County Team. In 1977, he was first-team All-Catholic, and second-team All-Dade County. By the time Murphy put away his kicking tee, he was Columbus High's All-time leading scorer on the gridiron. Just recently, Murphy was the first baseball player inducted into CCHS Baseball Diamond Hall of Fame, along with Louisiana State baseball coach Paul Mainieri, and former Chicago Cubs general manager Jim Hendry. In 2009, Murphy was inducted into CCHS General Hall of Fame.\n\nInstead of pursuing a professional baseball, Murphy accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for the Gators and advanced his computer science knowledge. As a freshman, Murphy led the Gators in ERA (2.53), and was named the Rookie of the Year. During his sophomore year, Murphy's 3-hit shutout over Tennessee secured the Gators' second consecutive SEC Eastern Division title, while also becoming the first Gator baseball team to win 40 regular season games. His career record was 6-3 while pitching in orange and blue. After his days in Gainesville, Murphy was drafted by Cincinnati Reds in the 1st round, as the third overall draft pick. He was only the 2nd Gator ever selected in the 1st round of the Major League draft.\n\nCincinnati Reds Minor League System 1981 - 1985\n1981 - Collected 6 wins for the Florida State League Northern Division champions, Tampa Tarpons.\n1983 - Led Cedar Rapids Reds in strikeouts on the way to being Central Division champs.\n1984 - Led the Eastern League in saves and captured the win in the championship game for the Eastern League title. Murphy was named Vermont Reds' Fireman of the Year.\n1985 - Led the Denver Zephyrs in ERA on their way to the Western Division title of the American Association.\n\nCincinnati Reds 1985-1988 \nA hard fastball thrower with a sharp slider, Murphy had an inauspicious debut by giving up a 400-foot blast to the first Major League hitter he faced, Mike Marshall. However, Murphy returned in his next outing with two shutout innings that suggested better things lie ahead.\n\nIn 1986, Rob brought all of his potential to the mound in what was an amazing season. His final ERA in 1986 was 0.72. In the history of Major League baseball, no pitcher who had pitched 50 innings or more had an ERA lower than Murphy’s. His ERA record still stands in the National League, and has only been lowered by the great Dennis Eckersley, Fernando Rodney and Zach Britton in the American League. That same season, his hits per nine inning ratio (4.65/9ip), had bested the previous National League records posted in 1972 and 1916. When Rob retired in 1995, that hits per inning ratio still stood atop the NL record book. In that memorable 1986 season, Murphy only gave up four doubles, and no triples or home runs. That stingy season led to a Slugging Percentage of .179. That figure crushed the almost 20-year-old record of Ted Abernathy. Murphy’s record stood for 17 years, and has only been surpassed by Eric Gagne and Craig Kimbrel.\n\nIn 1987, he followed with another superb year as the busiest left-handed reliever in major league history. His 87 relief appearances were the most ever by a lefty, as he pitched 100.2 innings and struck out 99 batters. As of 2013, 87 appearances is still the most by a Reds left-handed reliever.\n1988 saw Murphy lead the National League with 76 games pitched while pitching 84 2/3 innings. In four years with the Reds, Murphy had held 72 of the 78 leads he had been tasked with holding, and had stranded 79% of the runners he inherited. After the season, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox. \nComparing Murphy with all Cincinnati Reds’ pitchers that had pitched at least 200 innings, Murphy had these rankings in these categories when he had concluded his career with Cincinnati:\n\nCategory Stat Rank\nERA 2.60 15th\nK/9 7.92 3rd\nK/BB 2.26 10th\nH/9 7.09 3rd\nSLG% .306 2nd\nInh. Runners 21% 1st\n\nIn Boston in 1989, Murphy collected career-highs with nine saves and 105.0 innings pitched behind closer Lee Smith in the Boston bullpen. Murphy’s 74 appearances eclipsed the team’s record for games pitched by a left-hander. The previous record was held by Sparky Lyle. His 105 innings pitched was also the most by a Red Sox left hander, strictly in relief, and the last time a left-handed pitcher threw over 100 innings, strictly in relief, in the American League. By pitching over 100 relief innings in both the American and National Leagues, Murphy joined a very short list of lefties to accomplish this feat. Only Darold Knowles and Ron Perranoski had done this before, both in 1970. Rob was named the Red Sox Fireman of the Year (best reliever) by the Boston area Baseball Writers.\n\n1990 saw Murphy set a record for consecutive errorless games at start of career (332), previous record (175). The Red Sox won the Eastern Division of the American League.\n\nIn 1992, Rob set a dubious record for consecutive games without a win (146).\n\nMurphy also pitched for the Mariners, Cardinals, Yankees, Dodgers and Marlins, retiring at the end of the 1995 season.\n\nIn an eleven-season career, Murphy, compiled a 32–38 record with thirty saves and a 3.64 ERA in 597 games. At his retirement, he ranked eighteenth in the history of baseball for left-handed relief appearances, and had played longer in the Major Leagues than any player in University of Florida history. To this day, Murphy still leads all former Gator pitchers in years (11) and appearances (597), almost twice as many appearances as the next closest UF hurler.\n\nMurphy had also taken great pride in holding a lead, and stranding inherited runners left on base by his teammates. For National League pitchers with over 400 innings pitched, Rob stranded 78% of those runners which ranked him as the very best in that statistic when he retired in 1995. Currently, he is still in the top 5. Rob also held the lead his manager gave him over 91% of the time.\n\nA horse racing and thoroughbred enthusiast, Murphy has devised his own method for handicapping and breeding. Murphy's company, M375 Thoroughbreds, Inc., has bred, raised and raced such successful horses as Platinum Tiara, Swing and Miss, Diamond Studs, Strike Three and Golden Spikes.\n\nMurphy has also been active in charity fund-raising his career. While with the Reds, he participated in several Muscular Dystrophy Association telethons in the Cincinnati area. In Boston, Murphy worked with the Red Sox in-house charities, the Jimmy Fund and the 65 Roses Foundation. He also participated in events benefiting the ALS Association. Back at home in Florida, Murphy has attended many Redbone Organization events to benefit Cystic Fibrosis. Murphy continues to share his experience and expertise with the youth of Martin County by coaching baseball and softball players of all ages.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2200744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200744", "title": "Homestead exemption in Florida", "text": "Homestead exemption in Florida\n\nThe homestead exemption in Florida may refer to three different types of homestead exemptions under Florida law: \n\nFlorida's homestead exemption that provides an exemption from forced sale before and at death are among the most protective in the United States as it provides no limit to the value of certain real property that can be protected from creditors. The property tax exemption clause of Article VI renders property tax-free to the extent of certain dollar amounts in the value of the homestead. \n\nThe definition of a homestead is not necessarily co-extensive for Article X, Section 4(a)-(c) exemption purposes (exemption from creditors and restrictions on descent and distribution) and Article VI purposes (exemption from taxation). Both provisions apply automatically upon the establishment of a primary residence in Florida, but to reap the tax assessment benefits, the homestead exemption must be claimed by a filing with the local county property appraiser's office. Homestead can be lost if the homeowner abandons use of the real property as a homestead.\n\nA fourth benefit, while not as clearly an exemption as the above three, is also accorded to one's homestead in Florida per Art. VII, Section 7 of the Florida Constitution. For tax purposes the year-to-year increase in assessed value of the homestead is limited to the lesser of 3% or the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index.\n\nFlorida's debtor protection homestead provision is one of the broadest in the United States. The value of the property that can be protected is unlimited, so long as the property occupies no more than one-half acre (2,000 sq m) within a municipality, or 160 acres (650,000 sq m) outside of a municipality. The provision is written into the Florida Constitution, Article X, section 4, so it cannot be removed without a constitutional amendment.\n\nBecause of the scope of the protection afforded, persons from other states with heavy debts or large court judgments against them have been known to purchase expensive estates in Florida, one example being O.J. Simpson. This strategy has been somewhat impaired by the 2005 Bankruptcy Code amendments. \n\nOne event that can drastically affect the value of a homestead is municipal incorporation. If a 160-acre (650,000 sq m) non-municipal homestead is on land that is later incorporated into a municipality, the homestead will be grandfathered in and remain protected for the owner and his heirs. However, for any future purchasers of all or part of the property, the protected land will drop to the one-half acre (2,000 sq m) allowed within a municipality.\n\nThe Florida Constitutional homestead exemption offers virtually absolute protection from forced sale to meet the demands of creditors, except under four special circumstances, and should not be confused with the Florida Ad Valorem tax reduction savings, which is a product of the Florida legislature.\n\nOne unique feature of Florida's homestead exemption is that it attaches to proceeds from the sale of a home if the homeowner intends to use those proceeds to establish a new Florida homestead within a reasonable time. Therefore, if the owner of a $1,000,000 home sells that home and puts the money in a bank account, that money is still protected by the homestead exemption, so long as the homeowner has a bona fide intent to use it to purchase another home in Florida entitled to the exemption within a reasonable period of time. This protection is lost if the funds are commingled with other funds not designated for such a purchase. Also, the protection only extends to the amount the owner intends to invest in a new homestead - if the owner of a $1,000,000 home sells that home, and makes clear his intent to purchase a $750,000 home, the remaining $250,000 will lose its protection. (Note: Florida Statute 222.25(4) provides that if the debtor does not claim or receive the benefits of a homestead exemption, the debtor may claim a $4,000 personal property exemption which is over and above the $1000 to which all debtors are entitled pursuant to Florida Statute 222.25(1).\n\nFurthermore, under Florida's tax lien sale provision, liens of less than $250 on homestead properties cannot be sold to investors.\n\nFour types of creditors can still force the sale of a homestead to collect debts owed to them. These are:\n\nBecause the homestead exemption is a product of the Florida Constitution, it can also be overridden by the federal law due to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Federal income tax liens are superior to the homestead protection provided by the Florida Constitution. The Internal Revenue Service's policy is to be reluctant to foreclose on taxpayer's homes to enforce these liens, often only being satisfied if the real property is sold or mortgaged before the tax lien expires.\n\nFlorida's Supreme Court recently held Florida's homestead exemption may be waived in the limited exception of a bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nThe Great Depression began in 1929 and caused reforms in ad valorem property taxes in Florida. As the Depression deepened, many Florida property owners found themselves unable to pay their property taxes and in serious danger of losing their homes. In response to this problem, State Representative Dwight Rogers of Fort Lauderdale in 1933 proposed and passed legislation to place the $5,000 Homestead Exemption Amendment on the state ballot. Florida voters overwhelmingly approved the Homestead Exemption Amendment in 1934 (Article X, Section 7, as it was numbered before the 1968 Florida Constitutional re-write). The initial Homestead Exemption sought to ease the burden on homeowners by exempting property taxes on the first $5,000 of a homeowner's residence. The exemption was increased by the Florida Legislature to $10,000 during the 1960s, although this was not incorporated into the constitution. By Constitutional amendment adopted by a landslide in 1980, the exemption was increased to $25,000. On Jan. 29, 2008, voters approved an increase to $50,000 for non-school assessments, which is incorporated in Florida Statute §196.031. The reduction contained in Florida Statutes should not be confused by the Florida Constitution homestead exemption which protects the homestead from forced sale except under certain circumstances.\n\nFlorida property tax homestead exemption reduces the value of a home for assessment of property taxes by $50,000, so a home that was actually worth $100,000 would be taxed as though it was worth only $50,000. However, the second $25,000 of homestead coverage does not apply to the school portion of property taxes, and only applies to the third $25,000 of a property's total value (i.e., that portion of a property's value between $50,000-$75,000). \n\nAdditionally, the Florida homestead exemption caps the rate at which property assessments may be increased annually. Though millage rates may be changed, the assessed value a house with a homestead exemption can be increased by is fixed. This is the result of the \"Save Our Homes\" Amendment to the Florida Constitution which was passed by voters in 1992, and went into effect in 1995. The amendment caps the increase of the assessed value of a home with a homestead exemption to the lesser of 3% or the rate of inflation. This means that if an owner had a homestead exemption on a home valued at $100,000 in 1995, and the exemption was still valid in 2005, the most the home could be assessed at is approximately $126,000 . For comparison, records of the Florida Association of Realtors show the median price of a single family home during the same time increasing 138% from $86,000 in 1995 to $205,000 in 2005 \n\nHomestead exemptions are only available on an individual's primary home. Therefore, this exemption does not apply to businesses, rental property, second homes, homeowners claiming permanent residency-based exemptions or tax credits in other states, or homes with owners that do not claim Florida as their primary residence. Because of the \"portability\" provision of the January 2008 constitutional amendment, a homesteaded owner may now move up to $500,000 of the \"Save Our Homes\" benefit from one Florida home to the next. However, acquiring a house that had a homestead exemption does not entitle the buyer to retain the low tax rate enjoyed by the previous homesteaded resident, as homestead exemptions cannot be inherited or purchased. \n\nSupporters of the \"Save Our Homes\" Amendment contend that it allows long term residents with a fixed income to be able to afford to stay in their homes without being driven out by tax increases as their property value increases. Detractors argue that it creates an unfair system of taxation in which first time home buyers, new residents, seasonal residents, and businesses are burdened with more than their share of taxes while homesteaders are trapped in their own homes, often unable to move without doubling their tax rate.\n\nUnder Florida law, the homestead exemption is only available to US citizens, permanent resident aliens, or others who are legally able to form the intent to remain permanently under immigration laws. \n\nFor the taxation homestead exemption, \"Persons Residing Under Color of Law\" (a term created by the courts which applies to persons in the US with asylum or parole status, or someone who has applied for and completed the I-485 application process for a green card but is still awaiting final approval/issuance of the card). A person in the US under an E, H, L or R-class visa is not eligible for homestead, pursuant to Rule 12D-7.007(3), Florida Administrative Code. A person under an H or L visa who has an already approved I-140, and is awaiting USCIS retrogressions in order to submit the I-485 application, is not benefited with the homestead exemption. There is a loophole in the system, however. J-4 visa holders, who are spouses of J-1 visa holders, are assigned an Alien Number. Some counties accept alien numbers as part of the requirements to obtain a homestead exemption, although J visa holders cannot file for adjustment of status.\n\nAlso, in general, a husband and wife in an intact marriage are treated as a single \"family unit\" under Florida law and are only entitled to a total of one homestead exemption no matter how many homes they own and occupy.\n\nThe provision also protects a spouse in several ways. First, it restrains the homeowner from conveying the property without the approval of their spouse, even if the property is entirely in the name of one spouse, or was purchased entirely from funds of one spouse. The provision also prohibits a spouse from devising the property by will, if the homeowner is survived by a spouse or a minor child. If such a devise is made, it is deemed invalid, and the surviving spouse will enjoy a life estate with the remainder to the decedent's children. The surviving spouse may elect to take a 50% interest in lieu of the life estate as long as the election is made within six months of when the homeowner died. The election, in the form of a prescribed form, is recorded in the official record book of the county where the property lies, not with the probate court. If this election is made, the remaining 50% is inherited by the decedent's children. A spouse may waive these rights in writing with respect to the will, but a minor child is not competent to do so. Finally, the homestead exemption for property taxes automatically attaches to the surviving spouse, so the property will never be exposed to the creditors of either spouse because of the death of the other.\n\nThe elected Property Appraisers of Florida's 67 counties are the state constitutional officers responsible for maintaining the integrity of the homestead tax exemption program. No one in Florida \"automatically\" obtains a homestead exemption. Instead, a homeowner on title (or the beneficiary of a trust, a person legally or naturally dependent upon the owner or lessees having an original term of 98 years or more, all having to meet \"equitable title to real estate\" law) must file for a homestead exemption with the Property Appraiser in the county in which the property is located.

He claimed to have discovered springs and treasures hiding in the earth using his rod, and even tracked down criminals using it. According to some accounts, when he neared the scene of a murder using a divining rod, he would break into a sweat, shudder and, in some instances, even faint.\n\nIn 1692, Aymar-Vernay was hired by authorities to locate a murderer. By swinging a pendulum he identified a 19-year-old boy, a hunchback, as the culprit. The boy was subsequently \"broken on the wheel\" (tortuously executed). Aymar subsequently became something of a national celebrity for his \"ability\". When submitting to testing by Prince de Condé, however, he failed every single test.\n"}

It most often occurs where one player bets the clearly stronger hand and their opponent makes a poor call that eventually wins with the turn or the river card being dealt in their favor, for example.\n\nThere is no consensus however among poker players as to what exactly constitutes a bad beat and often players will disagree about whether a particular hand was a bad beat. A few examples are: quads over full house, quads over quads, straight flush over quads, small full house vs. bigger full house or better.\n\nAny hand that looked like a favorite to win can end up losing as more cards are dealt (with the nuts being the exception), but bad beats usually involve one of two not mutually exclusive scenarios:\n\n\nA bad beat can be a profound psychological blow, and can easily lead to a player going on tilt. Professional player Phil Hellmuth, among others, is notorious for his pronounced reactions to bad beats. However, suffering a bad beat means that the losing player was \"getting the money in good\" and in most instances would win by playing the same hand the same way. Thus, the more stoic poker players accept bad beats as an unpleasant but necessary drawback to a tactic that works the vast majority of the time.\n\nIn online poker rooms, bad beats often lead to accusations that the random number generator is \"rigged\", even though such beats also occur in offline games. Many online poker rooms post statistical data to demonstrate the randomness of the hands generated. In online poker games players have an opportunity to play in \"bad beat\" tables where the player who has the best losing hand receives an accumulated prize pool. An additional amount of rake is taken from each hand to fund the jackpot. The largest online jackpot to date was €1.25 million, hit in July 2011 with €443,000 going to the loser of the hand.\n\nPlayers are statistically more likely to experience bad beats online, since playing using a computer allows for more hands played per hour. Also, online players may play multiple cash game tables and/or tournaments at the same time, also increasing the frequency of hands dealt.\nAlso, tells are rendered moot, so players are incapable of reading clues such as body language in aid of deriving the strength of an opponent's hand.\nFinally, online poker games (especially freeroll tournaments) are far more accessible to the average player who, being average, is less likely to be knowledgeable regarding the techniques of the game, in turn making it more likely they will bet from the gut or intuition rather than experience.\n\nA bad beat jackpot is a prize that is paid when a sufficiently strong hand is shown down and loses to an even stronger hand held by another player. Not all poker games offer bad beat jackpots, and those that do have specific requirements for how strong a losing hand must be to qualify for the jackpot. For example, the losing hand may be required to be four-of-a-kind or better. There may be additional requirements as well. For example, in Texas hold 'em there is usually a requirement that both hole cards play in both the losing and winning hands, or that where a full house is the minimum (usually aces full of jacks or higher), both hole cards must be used to make the three-of-a-kind in the full house.\n\nBad beat jackpots are usually progressive, often with a small rake being taken out of each pot to fund the jackpot (in addition to the regular rake). When a jackpot is won, it is usually split among all players sitting at the table at the time of the bad beat with the losing hand getting the largest share, followed by the winning hand, and all the other players dividing the remainder. Generally, only the best losing hand is eligible to win the largest share, even if another hand would also qualify.\n\nSpecific rules, collections, payout percentages, and amounts vary greatly from one casino or cardroom to the next, and are sometimes changed.\n\n\n"}

Procopius writes that it was called Acampsis because it was impossible to force a way through it after it has entered the sea, since it discharges its stream with such force and swiftness, causing a great disturbance of the water before it, that it goes out for a very great distance into the sea and makes it impossible to coast along at that point.\n\nIn English, it was formerly known as the Boas, the Churuk, or the Chorokh.\n\nThe Çoruh valley lies within the Caucasus ecological zone, which is considered by the World Wide Fund for Nature and by Conservation International as a biodiversity hotspot. The Çoruh Valley is recognised by Turkish conservation organisations as an important plant area, an important bird area, a key biodiversity area and has been nominated as a high priority area for protection. This valley is rich in plants and contains 104 nationally threatened plant species of which 67 are endemic to Turkey.\n\nThe Çoruh has been called \"an eco-tourism gem\" and \"Turkey's last remaining wild river\", and is being promoted for whitewater kayaking by the Eastern Anatolia Tourism Development Project. It attracts kayakers and rafters from all over the world and was the site of the 4th World Rafting Championship in 1993 and the Coruh Extreme kayak competition in 2005.\nA total of 17 large hydroelectric dams are planned as part of the Çoruh River Development Plan but a total of 27 are proposed for the Çoruh River Catchment.

{"id": "2200760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200760", "title": "Eimeria tenella", "text": "Eimeria tenella\n\nEimeria tenella is a species of \"Eimeria\" that causes hemorrhagic cecal coccidiosis in young poultry. It is found worldwide.\n\nThis species has a monoxeous life cycle with the only definitive host as chickens; it is extremely host-specific. \nAcquired via fecal contamination of food and water (oral-fecal route), it undergoes endogenous merogony in the crypts of Lieberkuhn (intestinal ceca of chicken) and gametogony in epithelial cells of the small intestines. \nFusion of microgamete and macrogamete forms results in unsporulated zygotes, which are released with feces of chicken. The zygote sporulates after one to five days, and becomes infective.\n\nDiagnosis is based on finding oocysts in feces. While no effective treatment exists, the rate of infection can be reduced via prophylates, anticoccidial drugs and vaccination of baby chicks.\n\n\"Eimeria tenella\" has a monogenetic life cycle, that is, the life cycle involves a single host. Various stages of its complicated life cycle may conveniently be described under two phases, asexual cycle or schizogony and sexual cycle involving gametogony. Much of life cycle is intracellular. It is one of seven protozoan parasites that cause avian coccidiosis in poultry.\n\nThe unsporulated oocyst is shed from an infected bird in the feces. This exposure to air and moisture triggers meiosis and cell division. After 9–12 hours of sporulation (asexual reproduction by the production and release of spores) eight haploid sporozoites are formed. It has completed the sporulation stage after about 24 hours and can now infect a new host.\n\nThe chicken ingests the sporozoite where it is stripped of its oocyst wall by abrasion in the gizzard and breakdown in the lumen of the small intestine. The sporozoite then migrates to its preferred site of development (the caeca in the case of \"Eimeria tenella\") and invades the villus enterocyte. It then migrates to the crypt of the villus where it will complete development. There are two generations of schizonts and merozoites which are morphologycally distinguishable. The sporozoites undergo two waves of schizogeny (asexual reproduction) in the crypts and produce many first and second generation merozoites. These merozoites can invade locally and reproduce themselves to produce a smaller variety of schizonts. The sporozoites are then shed in the feces and the process begins again.\n\nThe beginning of complex life cycle of \"Eimeria tenella\" may be taken to be initiated by infection of epithelial cells of host cecum by sporozoites. The infected fowl passes out oocysts or zygocysts with fecal matter. When their oocysts are swallowed by a new or healthy bird, its gizzard and digestive juices dissolve the cystwall and release sporozoites which enter the host epithelial cells. Within the epithelial cells, the sporozoites grow in size and multiply by schizogony.\n\nIt is the earliest intracellular stage of parasite. It is elongated, slightly curved, microscopic unicellular organism with one end pointed and the other end blunt. The pellicle, forming external envelope, contains longitudinally arranged contractile microtubules which help in wriggling movements of organism. Cytoplasm includes a vesicular nucleus, a mitochondrion, golgi bodies, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, lysosomes and vacuoles containing reserve food, etc. Penetration of sporozoite into host epithelial cell is facilitated by the lytic secretion stored in roptries of parasite. The measurement of body is as 19.5–25 by 16.5–23 micrometer.\n\n"}

The drama features Robert Mitchum, Jane Russell, William Bendix, and Gloria Grahame.\n\nThree strangers arrive at the port of Macao on the same ship: Nick Cochran (Robert Mitchum), a cynical-but-honest ex-serviceman, Julie Benson (Jane Russell), an equally cynical, sultry night club singer, and Lawrence Trumble (William Bendix), a traveling salesman who deals in both silk stockings and contraband.\nCorrupt police lieutenant Sebastian (Thomas Gomez) notifies casino owner and underworld boss Vincent Halloran (Brad Dexter) about the new arrivals. Halloran has been tipped off about an undercover New York City policeman out to lure him into international waters so he can be arrested. With only three strangers to choose from, Halloran assumes Nick is the cop. He tries to bribe a puzzled Nick to leave Macao, but Nick is interested in getting to know Julie better and turns him down. Halloran hires Julie as a singer, in part to find out what she knows about Nick.\n\nLater, Trumble offers Nick a commission to help him sell a stolen diamond necklace. However, when Nick shows Halloran a diamond from the necklace, Halloran recognizes it; he had sent the jewelry to Hong Kong only a week earlier to be sold. Now sure of Nick's identity, he has the American taken prisoner for later questioning.\n\nNick is guarded by two thugs and Halloran's jealous girlfriend, Margie (Gloria Grahame).\nWorried that Halloran is planning to dump her for Julie, Margie lets Nick escape, with the two guards close behind. When Trumble happens on the late-night chase, he tries to help Nick and is killed, mistaken by the thugs for Nick. Before he dies, he tells Nick about the police boat waiting offshore.\n\nWhen Nick tries to get Julie to go away with him, he learns that Halloran has invited her on a trip to Hong Kong (to retrieve his property). With this information, Nick is able to dispose of Halloran's murderous henchman, Itzumi (Philip Ahn), and take the helm of Halloran's boat. He steers for the waiting police and hands Halloran over to them.\n\nMacao was the second feature that Josef von Sternberg filmed to fulfill a two-picture contract with RKO Pictures then owned by Howard Hughes. (Sternberg's first feature for Hughes was the color epic Jet Pilot). Shooting began in September 1950 and was released in April 1952.\n\nSternberg's habit of handling actors \"as mere details of décor\" elicited strenuous objections from stars Jane Russell and Gloria Grahame such that \"the shooting of Macao has become a minor legend.\" John Baxter reports that \"fights on the set\" were not uncommon, and were manifested in the \"strained\" performances of the cast.\n\nDuring the final stages of filming, director Nicholas Ray was enlisted for perform retakes on a critical fistfight scene between Robert Mitchum and Brad Dexter, because Sternberg's handling was deemed unsatisfactory by producer Alex Gottlieb. Although uncredited, Ray's contribution to the picture was recognized by Sternberg.\n\nSternberg, who \"despised the script and the close control\" by the studio \"disowned\" responsibility for the production.\n\nOnly stock footage was shot on location in Hong Kong and Macau.

Both Sarris and Baxter acknowledge Sternberg's stylistic signature in the deadly waterfront chase amid the docked fishing boat, as well as the amusing bedroom scene where an electric fan reduces a pillow to \"a storm of feathers.\" \n\nIn 2005, film critic Dennis Schwartz, writing for \"Ozus' World Movie Reviews\", lauded the casting of Jane Russell and Robert Mitchum:\n\nBaxter laments that \"Macao\", though \"not a classic work ... ill-deserves its present obscurity.\" \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2200776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200776", "title": "Hyperdispensationalism", "text": "Hyperdispensationalism\n\nHyperdispensationalism, mid-Acts dispensationalism or Bullingerism) (to which ultradispensationalism properly applies) is a Protestant conservative evangelical movement that values biblical inerrancy and a literal hermeneutic. Opponents of hyperdispensationalism are traditional dispensationalists, like John Walvoord and Charles Ryrie, classic Acts 2 Pauline dispensationalists, and ultradispensationalists.\n\nWithin the United States, some advocates of hyperdispensationalism refer to themselves as members of the Grace Movement and they reject the prefix \"hyper\" or \"ultra\" as pejorative or misinforming). Many affiliate with the Grace Gospel Fellowship, a church association, and its Grace Christian University or the more conservative Berean Bible Society.\n\nHyperdispensationalism holds that the early Christian Church lost four basic truths starting near the end of the Apostle Paul’s ministry. The four truths are (in order of loss):\nThe truths, advocates say, were gradually recovered in reverse order starting during the Reformation. For example, Martin Luther is credited with recovery of \"justification by faith\" and John Nelson Darby with \"Church Truth\".\n\nHyperdispensationalists reject water baptism, (along with charismatic gifts, prophets, and apostles) which divides them from mainstream dispensationalists who are often Baptists, like W. A. Criswell, or in earlier times Presbyterians like James H. Brookes. So instead of various water baptisms, they believe in the baptism made without hands and without water by the Spirit which occurs when one believes in Christ as their Savior whereby one is identified with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. While hyperdispensationalists reject water baptism like ultradispensationalists, they still practice the Lord's Supper as a memorial and not as an ordinance. (Ultradispensationalists also reject the Lord's Supper and water baptism.)\n\nHyperdispensationalists are not monolithic nor homogenous. There are two main positions, as well as a few other minor variations. The two main positions are Acts 9 and Acts 13. The differences are minor being only technical. They all see the dispensation of Grace which is the church age as beginning with the Apostle Paul. Also, within the movement is found King James only elements associated mainly with the teachings of Richard Jordan and Grace School of the Bible. While the Acts 2 position tries to distance itself from its more consistent dispensational brothers, as well as, ultradispensationalism (starts the church after Acts 28), they are all true dispensationalists and fully evangelical still tending towards fundamentalism. Furthermore, the differences separating the Mid-Acts position from the Acts 28 position are just as great as those separating the Acts 2 position from its more consistent Mid-Acts dispensational brothers.\n\nEarly ultradispensationalism (Acts 28 dispensationalism), like that promoted by E. W. Bullinger, emphasized a dispensational boundary, as in Acts 28:28, but did not apply this boundary line to the Pauline epistles. Unlike Bullinger, Robert Anderson posited a Pentecostal dispensation during the period covered by the Book of Acts. Bullinger considered that the Pauline epistles, as a whole, whether or not they were written before or after Acts 28:28 in almost all of his writings. Bullinger thus had not applied his Acts 28 position consistently to his exposition of Paul's epistles until later in life and then only in one book. Thus, most of his books had already been published, along with the writings of Robert Anderson, view Paul's epistles monolithically and are then quite compatible with Mid-Acts hyperdispensationalism.\n\nThe Mid-Acts position and the Acts 28 position differ mainly on when the normative portion of Paul's ministry to the church began. Both hyperdispensationalism and ultradispensationalism see the Gospel accounts as for Israel in the Mosaic dispensation. Mid-Acts types take all of Paul's epistles to be directly written to the church, thus accepting the practice of the Lord's Supper as for that dispensation of grace, but the Acts 28 position takes only Paul's prison epistles (those written while in prison after Acts 28) to be directly applicable to the church today, thus denying the Lord's Supper for today. There is only one baptism made without hands in which the believer is baptized into Christ by the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:13), which is held in contradistinction to Christ baptizing believing Israel in Acts 2 with the Holy Spirit. The pouring-out baptism of the Holy Spirit is in fulfillment of the Old Testament promise of the New Covenant to Israel. Thus, it has nothing to do with the newly-revealed mystery to and through the apostle Paul, who is not sent out until years later with the new ministry to the gentiles to establish a new church which is composed of both believing Israelites and believing gentiles, not just Israelites (which includes proselytes to Judaism), as in Acts 2.\n\nPaul, it is specifically noted, was sent to preach the gospel but not to baptize, unlike notably the Lord's commission to his apostles. The new church is not obligated to any Jewish rituals (like water baptism), according to the determination of the Council of Jerusalem recorded in Acts 15.\n\nBullinger held that Paul's authoritative teaching began after the conclusion of the Book of Acts, a viewpoint that is now characterized as Acts 28 ultradispensationalism (chapter 28 being the concluding chapter of the book). The position was first suggested by J.B. Cole and later solidified by Charles H. Welch.\n\nThe Mid-Acts position was developed independently in America later by J.C. O'Hair and followed later by Cornelius R. Stam and Charles F. Baker, among others, and reflects their position that Paul's normative ministry began with Paul's ministry with his salvation in Acts 9 (Stam) or with Paul's commission in Acts 13 (O'Hair, Baker). A very few independent spirits have staked the beginning of the church in a few other chapters, but such differences are technical, preferences rather than disagreements. The hallmark is that the church is served uniquely with Paul's ministry and upon that, there is a complete agreement.\n\nActs is seen as a transitional period between dispensations, and the Mid-Acts position does not insert an extra dispensation there (contra Ryrie), as did Anderson.\n\nJohn Nelson Darby, the father of dispensationalism, believes that the church began at Pentecost, but his dispensational scheme is not like Scofield's and later American dispensationalists (except classic Pauline dispensationalism). It is also unlike that of hyperdispensationalists. The church does not begin with a new dispensation for Darby, as the administrations upon Earth are not relevant for the heavenly church body. One can study R.A. Huebner, who sees the Church's advent at Acts 2, to get a better understanding of Darby's scheme of dispensations which is different than Scofield's. Also, Miles J. Stanford (classic Pauline dispensationalism) follows Darby's dispensational scheme and criticizes Acts 28 as well as Mid-Acts dispensationalists for not following Darby. Stanford drew heavily upon Darby's soteriology of \"spiritual growth\" and considered himself a \"classic Pauline dispensationalist\" in the line of the Plymouth Brethren Darbyite dispensationalists.\n\nHowever, classic (Pauline) dispensationalism's earliest teachers (Darbyite) were the source for J.C. O'Hair's consistent dispensational doctrines, but he seems to have adopted Scofield's dispensational scheme, adapting it to the Mid-Acts position. Also, early Calvinism does not seem to be in evidence so much today and is being fully rejected in more and more churches.\n\nIf Darby appears to be followed more closely by hyperdispensationalism, Darby's dispensationalism and hyperdispensationalism are more consistent than American Acts 2 dispensationalism in marking Scripture's distinction between national Israel, with its earthly kingdom, from the Church, which is Christ's heavenly body. Here too, hyperdispensationalism and ultradispensationalism may be seen to make more than a mere distinction between Israel and the Church, but classic (Pauline) dispensationalism (Acts 2) is as extreme, if not more so, in making rather a separation between Israel and the Church.\n\nO'Hair followed more closely to the early American dispensationalists and abandoned denominational loyalties. Rejecting gifts for the Church age led to a rejection of water baptism and the Acts 2 position. He then began to explore Acts 28 as an alternative but eventually rejected that as well. It was then that H.A. Ironside wrote, \"Wrongly Dividing the Word of Truth,\" confusing O'Hair with Bullinger's teachings. Later, O'Hair settled upon the Mid-Acts position.\n\nThe most notable proponents of the Mid-Acts view were J.C. O'Hair, Charles Baker, and C.R. Stam. The Mid-Acts dispensational viewpoint is also shared on many current television programs, including \"Forgotten Truths\" with Richard Jordan, \"Through the Bible\" with Les Feldick, and \"Transformed by Grace\" with Kevin Sadler. \n\n\n\n"}

In appreciation, Alvin heals Lolla-Wossiky's painful memories, allowing him to give up alcohol and become in touch with the land once again. Lolla-Wossiky grows into \"the Prophet\" although he prefers to be known as Tenskwa-Tawa. Lolla-Wossiky preaches both pacifism and separatism, believing that \"Reds\" should live west of the Mississippi and \"Whites\" should live east of it.\n\nMeanwhile, Lolla-Wossiky's brother, Ta-Kumsaw, tries to rally \"Reds\" behind his belief that their land should be defended violently. When Alvin Miller Jr. and his older brother Measure travel to the place of his birth (where Alvin is expected to become apprenticed to the Hatrack River blacksmith) the two brothers are captured by 'Reds' (Native Americans) sent by William Henry Harrison to intentionally create conflict. Ta-Kumsaw, sent by Lolla-Wossiky, rescues the brothers from torture and death. Measure leaves the \"Reds\" only to be captured by William Henry Harrison's men and subsequently beaten to the brink of death. Ta-Kumsaw accompanies Alvin to the holy site of Eight-Face Mound where they meet up with Taleswapper, an old friend of Alvin. Using the spiritual powers of the Eight-Face Mound, Alvin is able to heal Measure from afar. Measure is then able to stop some of the slaughter of Lolla-Wossiky's followers by villagers and William Henry Harrison's men over the alleged kidnapping and murder of Alvin and Measure Miller.\n\nA twelve-part comic book version of the novel was printed by Marvel's Dabel Brothers Productions imprint. One of the issues of the comic series featured on its cover a copy of the painting \"Engaging the Shawnee Village\" by John Buxton, which had been commissioned by the Heritage Center of Clark County, Ohio.\n\n\n\n"}

LaValle Stadium is the main stadium for Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York, United States. Construction began in 2000 at a cost of approximately $22 million. With a capacity of 12,300 people (10,300 seating and 2,000 standing), it is the largest outdoor facility in Suffolk County. The stadium is home to the Division I Stony Brook Seawolves and their football, men's soccer, women's soccer, men's lacrosse, and women's lacrosse teams.\n\nThe stadium opened on September 14, 2002. It was named in honor of New York state senator Kenneth LaValle on October 19, 2002. LaValle played a key role in the development and creation of the stadium. The stadium consists of a three-tier press box on the east side, as well as six luxury suites, a press box, television and radio booths, and a camera deck on the roof.\n\nSeawolves Stadium opened on September 14, 2002 as the Stony Brook Seawolves football team faced the St. John's Red Storm in Stony Brook's first game as a Division I program. Stony Brook won 34–9, and the opening kickoff was returned for a touchdown by the Seawolves. At the time of its opening, the 8,136-seat stadium was the largest in Suffolk County, a record that is still held today.\n\nOn October 19, 2002, the date of Stony Brook's Homecoming game against Sacred Heart, the stadium was renamed the Kenneth P.

{"id": "2200804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200804", "title": "Akbarnama", "text": "Akbarnama\n\nThe Akbarnama which translates to \"Book of Akbar\", is the official chronicle of the reign of Akbar, the third Mughal Emperor (r. 1556–1605), commissioned by Akbar himself by his court historian and biographer, Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, called one of the \"nine jewels in Akbar's court\" by Mughal writers. It was written in Persian, the literary language of the Mughals, and includes vivid and detailed descriptions of his life and times. It followed the \"Baburnama\", the more personal memoir by his grandfather, Babur, founder of the dynasty. Like that, it was produced in the form of lavishly illustrated manuscripts.\nThe work was commissioned by Akbar, and written by Abul Fazl, one of the \"Nine Jewels\" (Hindi: Navaratnas) of Akbar’s royal court. It is stated that the book took seven years to be completed. The original manuscripts contained many miniature paintings supporting the texts, thought to have been illustrated between c. 1592 and 1594 by at least forty-nine different artists from Akbar's studio, representing the best of the Mughal school of painting, and masters of the imperial workshop, including Basawan, whose use of portraiture in its illustrations was an innovation in Indian art.\n\nAfter Akbar's death in 1605, the manuscript remained in the library of his son, Jahangir (r. 1605-1627) and later Shah Jahan (r. 1628-1658). Today, the illustrated manuscript of \"Akbarnma\", with 116 miniature paintings, is at the Victoria and Albert Museum. It was bought by the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) in 1896 from Mrs Frances Clarke, acquired by her husband upon his retirement from serving as Commissioner of Oudh (1858-1862). Soon after, the paintings and illuminated frontispiece were removed from the volume to be mounted and framed for display.\n\nThe first volume of \"Akbarnama\" deals with the birth of Akbar, the history of Timur's family and the reigns of Babur and Humayun and the Suri sultans of Delhi. Volume one of Akbarnama encompasses Akbar's birth and his upbringings. According to the Abul Fazl Humayun, the second Mughal emperor and Akbar's father is praying to the Ka'ba, an Islamic holy place, for a successor to the Mughal empire. After this prayer, Maryam Makani showcases different signs that she is pregnant with Akbar such as having a shining forehead that others believe to be a mirror on her face or the warmth and joy that enters her bosom when a light shines on her. Miryam believes the light to be God's Light blessing her and her unborn child. Nine months later while Humayuan is away, Maryam gives birth to Akbar under what is considered an auspicious star and there is great celebration.\n<br>\nThe second volume describes the detailed history of the reign of Akbar till 1602 and records the events during Akbar's reign. It also deals with how Bairam Khan and Akbar won the battle of Panipat against Hemu an Indian warrior.\n\nThe third volume, called the \"\", describes the administrative system of the Empire as well as containing the famous \"Account of the Hindu Sciences\". It also deals with Akbar's household, army, the revenues and the geography of the empire. It also produces rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. It is famous for its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crop yields, prices, wages and revenues. Here Abu'l Fazl's ambition, in his own words, is: \"It has long been the ambitious desire of my heart to pass in review to some extent, the general conditions of this vast country, and to record the opinions professed by the majority of the learned among the Hindus. I know not whether the love of my native land has been the attracting influence or exactness of historical research and genuine truthfulness of narrative...\" (\"Āin-i-Akbarī\", translated by Heinrich Blochmann and Colonel Henry Sullivan Jarrett, Volume III, pp 7). In this section, he expounds the major beliefs of the six major Hindu philosophical schools of thought, and those of the Jains, Buddhists, and Nāstikas. He also gives several Indian accounts of geography, cosmography, and some tidbits on Indian aesthetic thought. Most of this information is derived from Sanskrit texts and knowledge systems. Abu'l Fazl admits that he did not know Sanskrit and it is thought that he accessed this information through intermediaries, likely Jains who were favoured at Akbar's court.\n\nIn his description of Hinduism, Abu’l Fazl tries to relate everything back to something that the Muslims could understand. Many of the orthodox Muslims thought that the Hindus were guilty of two of the greatest sins, polytheism and idolatry.\n\nOn the topic of idolatry, Abu’l Fazl says that the symbols and images that the Hindus carry are not idols but merely are there to keep their minds from wandering. He writes that only serving and worshipping God is required.\n\nAbul Fazl also describes the Caste system to his readers. He writes the name, rank, and duties of each caste. He then goes on to describe the sixteen subclasses which come from intermarriage among the main four.\n\nAbu’l Fazl next writes about Karma about which he writes, “This is a system of knowledge of an amazing and extraordinary character, in which the learned of Hindustan concur without dissenting opinion.” He places the actions and what event they bring about in the next life into four different kinds. First, he writes many of the different ways in which a person from one class can be born into a different class in the next life and some of the ways in which a change in gender can be brought about. He classifies the second kind as the different diseases and sicknesses one suffers from. The third kind is actions which cause a woman to be barren or the death of a child. And the fourth kind deals with money and generosity, or lack thereof.\n\nThe \"Ain-i-Akbari\" is currently housed in the Hazarduari Palace, in West Bengal.\n\nThe \"Akbarnama\" of Shaikh Illahdad Faiz Sirhindi is another contemporary biography of the Mughal emperor Akbar. This work is mostly not original and basically a compilation from the \"Tabaqat-i-Akbari\" of Khwaja Nizam-ud-Din Ahmad and the more famous \"Akbarnama\" of Abu´l Fazl. The only original elements in this work are a few verses and some interesting stories. Very little is known about the writer of this \"Akbarnama\". His father Mulla Ali Sher Sirhindi was a scholar and Khwaja Nizam-ud-Din Ahmad, the writer of the \"Tabaqat-i-Akbari\" was his student. He lived in Sirhind sarkar of Delhi Subah and held a \"madad-i-ma´ash\" (a land granted by the state for maintenance) village there. He accompanied his employer and patron Shaikh Farid Bokhari (who held the post of the \"Bakhshi-ul-Mulk\") on his various services. His most important work is a dictionary, the \"Madar-ul-Afazil\", completed in 1592. He started writing this \"Akbarnama\" at the age of 36 years. His work also ends in 1602 like the one of Abu´l Fazl. This work provides us with some additional information regarding the services rendered by Shaikh Farid Bokhari. It also provides valuable information regarding the siege and capture of Asirgarh.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2200815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200815", "title": "Eimeria", "text": "Eimeria\n\nEimeria is a genus of apicomplexan parasites that includes various species capable of causing the disease coccidiosis in animals such as cattle, poultry, dogs (especially puppies), cats (especially kittens), and smaller ruminants including sheep and goats. \"Eimeria\" species are considered to be monoxenous because the life cycle is completed within a single host, and stenoxenous because they tend to be host specific, although a number of exceptions have been identified. Species of this genus infect a wide variety of hosts. Thirty-one species are known to occur in bats (Chiroptera), two in turtles, and 130 named species infect fish. Two species (\"E. phocae\" and \"E. weddelli\") infect seals. Five species infect llamas and alpacas: \"E. alpacae\", \"E. ivitaensis\", \"E. lamae\", \"E. macusaniensis\", and \"E. punonensis\". A number of species infect rodents, including \"E. couesii\", \"E. kinsellai\", \"E. palustris\", \"E. ojastii\" and \"E. oryzomysi\". Others infect poultry (\"E. necatrix\" and \"E. tenella\"), rabbits (\"E. stiedae\") and cattle (\"E. bovis\", \"E. ellipsoidalis\", and \"E. zuernii\"). For full species list, see below.\n\nThe most prevalent species of \"Eimeria\" that cause coccidiosis in cattle are \"E. bovis\", \"E. zuernii\", and \"E. auburnensis\". In a young, susceptible calf it is estimated that as few as 50,000 infective oocysts can cause severe disease. \"Eimeria\" infections are particularly damaging to the poultry industry and costs the United States more than $1.5 billion in annual loses. The most economically important species among poultry are \"E. tenella\", \"E. acervulina\", and \"E. maxima\". The oocysts of what was later called \"Eimeria steidai\" were first seen by the pioneering Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723) in the bile of a rabbit in 1674. The genus is named after the German zoologist Theodor Eimer (1843–1898).\n\nThe \"Eimeria\" life cycle has an exogenous phase, during which the oocysts are excreted into the environment, and an endogenous phase, where parasite development occurs in the host intestine. During the endogenous phase, several rounds of asexual reproduction, or schizogony take place, after which the sexual differentiation of gametes and fertilisation occurs. Parasite transmission occurs via the oral-fecal route. Infections are common in farming environments where many animals are confined in a small space.\n\nThere are two forms of oocyst: sporulated or late oocyst, and unsporulated or early oocyst. An infected host releases oocysts into the environment in their unsporulated form. These contain a multi-layered cell wall making them highly resistant to environmental pressures. Once released, the unsporulated oocysts undergo meiosis upon contact with oxygen and moisture. This process is known as sporulation and the oocysts take approximately 2 to 7 days to become infectious. The sporulated oocyst is said to be tetrasporic meaning it contains four sporocysts, while each sporocyst is dizoic, i.e. it contains two sporozoites.\n\nOnce ingested, the oocysts undergo a process called excystation, whereby thousands of sporozoites are released into lumen of the intestine. In the case of \"E. tenella\", this process is thought to occur due to the combination of enzymatic degradation and mechanical abrasion of the oocyst wall in the chicken's gizzard.\n\nThe motile sporozoites invade the enterocytes of small intestine, and migrate to their respective sites of development. Invasion is mediated through specialised membrane-bound structures on the surface of the parasite that release secretions. This results in the recognition of, and attachment to host cell receptors. This process is known as gliding motility, which is conserved across all species of \"Apicomplexa\". Membrane glyconjugates have been proposed as potential host cell receptors for \"Eimeria\" species. After invasion, the sporozoites develop into trophozoites, then into schizonts, where they undergo several rounds of asexual reproduction. This results in many nuclei developing within the schizont. Each nucleus develops into a merozoite.\n\nInvasion requires the formation of a moving junction between parasite and host cell membranes. In \"E. tenella\", this involves parasite micronemes and rhoptry proteins including RON2, RON5 and AMA-2. It is unlikely that the host cell is completely passive in the invasion process, although evidence of host physical forces that assist in mediating parasite entry remains controversial.\n\nWhen schizonts rupture, merozoites are released, which either go on to re-infect more enterocytes or develop into either male or female gametes via the process of gametogenesis. These gametes fuse to form an oocyst, which is then released in its non-infectious, unsporulated form through the faeces of the host.\n\nMerozoite invasion also requires the formation of a moving junction, however the proteins involved in this process differs from those on sporozoites. Rhoptry proteins AMA-1 and RON4 are found exclusively on merozoites. There is also a greater diversity of variant surface antigens found on the surface of merozoites. It is hypothesised that this may be due to the fact that merozoites are short-lived and a greater antigen repertoire would permit faster binding and invasion.\n\nThe \"Eimeria\" lie within the family Eimeriidae. \"Eimeria\" accounts for close to 75% of the species within this family, and it is the most specious of the genera of the Apicomplexa with 1,700 described species.\n\nAttempts to subdivide this large taxonomic unit into separate genera have been made. The classification of eimeriid coccidian was largely based on morphological and life cycle details. More recently, classification has been done using rDNA and mitochondrial genes, which indicate \"Eimeria\" may be paraphyletic to \"Isospora\" and \"Cyclospora\" \n\n\"Eimeria\": These species are tetrasporocystic with dizoic, nonbivalved sporocysts with or without Stieda bodies. This new genus retains the majority of the species.\n\n\"Goussia\" (Labbe 1896): These species are tetrasporocystic, dizoic, lack Stieda bodies, and have sporocyst walls consisting of two valves joined by a longitudinal suture. This genus contains about 20 species.\n\n\"Crystallospora\" (Thelohan 1893): The species in this genus is tetrasporocystic and dizoic, and have dodecahedral sporocysts composed of two hexagonal, pyrimidal valves joined at their bases by a suture. This genus contains a single species, \"Crystallospora cristalloides\"\n\n\"Epieimeria\": The species in this genus are tetrasporocystic, dizoic, possess Stieda bodies, and undergo merogony and gametogony on the lumenal surface of the intestinal tract. Three species are in this genus.\n\nMethods for species identification are varied and among others, include isozyme analysis, the use of rRNA and rDNA probes, DNA assays and recombinant DNA techniques. PCR has proven most useful for outbreak surveillance. Prior to these methods, species identification was based on phenotypic characteristics such as the site of parasite development, the oocyst structure, the host species, cross immunity and the presence of lesions. Out of these, comparing oocyst structures was the most commonly used method.\n\nA whole genome sequencing project is in progress with chosen species, \"Eimeria tenella\". The genome is about 60 megabases in size and has a GC-content around 53%. The 14 chromosomes range in size from 1 to > 6 megabases. Since 2013, the sequencing and annotation of a further six avian \"Eimeria\" species genomes is in progress.\n\nCoccidiosis typically results in diarrhoea, weight loss and dehydration. A combination of these factors may result in poor growth and death of the animal, particularly amongst young. Other clinical signs include lethargy, depression, and reduced normal grooming behaviour. Diarrhoea may be bloody due to intestinal epithelium dying off when a large number of oocysts and merozoites burst out of the cells.\n\nThe severity of the disease is directly dependent on the number of infective \"Eimeria\" oocysts that are ingested. The pathogenesis of infection varies from mild to severe, and is largely dependent on the magnitude of infection. In light infections, the damage to the gut might only be minimal and be rapidly repaired as cells are rapidly replaced by the body. However, in heavy infections, it may only take two weeks for many intestinal epithelial cells to be infected with either \"Eimeria\" meronts or gametocytes. These cause the epithelial cells to burst, which causes significant damage to the intestine epithelial layer, resulting in the release of blood, fluid, and electrolytes into the intestine.\n\nGood animal husbandry practices and prophylactic application of anticoccidial drugs that target different stages of the parasite lifecycle, such as sulfonamides, ionophores and toltrazuril, are the preferred methods of disease prevention, particularly in the poultry industry.\n\nThe following drugs can be used for treatment of coccidiosis in cattle: amprolium, sulfaquinoxaline, and sulfamethazine. However, it is often more effective to prevent this disease in cattle, which can be aided by the products lasalocid, decoquinate, and monensin.\n\nThere is a growing problem of drug resistance, as well as possible drug residues in the meat once the animal is butchered. As a result, other avenues of control are being explored, particularly vaccine development, although several live attenuated vaccines have been in use since the 1950s. So far, the best practice is to vaccinate the chicks once they hatch from the egg so they are immune for life.\n\nInfection with \"Eimeria\" results in life-long immunity to that particular parasite species, but does not give cross protection against other species. For these reasons, vaccines for control seem promising, of which live attenuated vaccines are most effective. However, the search for highly immunogenic antigens and overcoming antigenic variation of the parasites remains a challenge. Immunity to the parasite varies depending on parasite and host species, as well as the site of invasion. CD4+ T cells and interferon gamma (γ) are crucial components of natural immunity to infection. Humoral immunity is thought to play little role in protection, and is most likely mediated through secretory IgA antibodies.\n\n\"Eimeria aurati\" - goldfish (\"Carassius auratus\")\n\"Eimeria

The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery.\n\n\"San Diego\" is a slow rotator. In March 2005, a rotational lightcurve was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory () in Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (). The period was derived from a re-examined lightcurve that originally gave a much shorter period of hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination.\n\nAccording to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, \"San Diego\" measures 4.8 and 5.0 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.25 and 0.28, respectively, while the \"Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link \" assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids both as family and orbital group – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 13.7.\n\nThis minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution . Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 13 July 1984 ().\n\n"}

The next significant events were in 1972, at which time the professional branch of DFC was renamed FC Dordrecht, and In 1974 when the professionals and amateurs severed their ties.\n\nFollowing their reorganisation in 1979 (which led to a change in name to Drechtsteden'79 (DS'79) – referring to the region Drechtsteden), the club was promoted to the Eredivisie in 1983. This however was not to last and was immediately followed by a relegation back to the Eerste Divisie. They went back up to the Eredivisie in 1988/1989 season.\n\nIn 1990, another investor gave the club its third name of Dordrecht'90. The club just missed promotion to the Eredivisie in 1991, but was finally admitted when Dordrecht'90 surprisingly merged with neighbouring Schiedamse Voetbal Vereniging (SVV) of Schiedam. The club used the name of \"SVV/Dordrecht'90\" for two seasons, but in 1993, the 'SVV' was dropped and the club was renamed Dordrecht'90.\n\nFinally in 2002, the club was again renamed, to the name it bore from 1972 to 1979: FC Dordrecht and that is how the name stands today. For a number of years it was one of the clubs with the lowest average attendance of all Dutch professional teams.\nUndoubtedly the most famous player to wear a Dordrecht shirt was Johan Cruijff, who played 3 friendly matches for the club in January 1981.\n\n\nBelow is a table with FC Dordrecht's domestic results since the introduction of professional football in 1956.\n\n"}
{"id": "2200834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200834", "title": "Des Voeux Road", "text": "Des Voeux Road\n\nDes Voeux Road Central and Des Voeux Road West are two roads on the north shore of Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong. They were named after the 10th Governor of Hong Kong, Sir William Des Vœux. The name was sometimes spelt with the ligature œ in pre-war documents but is nowadays spelt officially as Des Voeux Road.\n\nBeginning in 1857, the northern shore of Hong Kong Island (also known as Victoria City) underwent a series of reclamations under then-Governor Sir John Bowring. The first phase of the Praya Reclamation Scheme had a direct effect on this current street, which used to be known as Praya Central during the Colonial Hong Kong era. Bowring's plans were opposed by British merchants who held lands in the Central area, and in response, the government instead commenced work in land reclamation in the Chinese-populated Western District. By the time the reclamation was extended to Central, the newly reclaimed land in Western had already been settled, and there was a discontinuity between the two roads running along the western and middle portions of the reclaimed shoreline. Upon completion, the roads were named Bowring Praya West and Bowring Praya Central respectively.\n\nAnother series of extensive reclamation projects began in 1887 under then-Governor Des Voeux. Upon completion in 1904, Bowring Praya West and Bowring Praya Central (which by then were situated inland from the shoreline) were respectively renamed Des Voeux Road West and Des Voeux Road Central per the orders of then-Colonial Secretary and acting Governor Francis Fleming during the Duke of Connaught's visit to Hong Kong in 1890.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1945, the road was renamed Shōwa-dori by the Japanese occupation government.\n\nDes Voeux Road Central runs from Western to Central. It begins at the intersection with On Tai Street in Western and merges with Queen's Road Central where it becomes Queensway (and, later, Hennessy Road). Landmarks along Des Voeux Road Central include:\n\nDes Voeux Road West runs from Western Shek Tong Tsui. It reaches an alignment several blocks down at the junction with Connaught Road West and becomes Kennedy Town Praya in Shek Tong Tsui.\n\nVarious groups have long proposed pedestrianising a section of Des Voeux Road Central.\n\nThe idea was first proposed in 2000 by the Hong Kong Institute of Planners (HKIP) as a transport improvement scheme. The scheme was deemed technically feasible but was not implemented by the government at that time. A further study was done in 2014 in collaboration with the MTR and MVA, the leading traffic engineering firm in Hong Kong, to explore how the environment can be enhanced with the transport improvement scheme. The plan involves converting a 1.4 km section of Des Voeux Road Central, between Pedder Street and the Western Market, from a thoroughfare for motorised traffic to a pedestrian zone. The tramway would be maintained in situ and the cross-streets would remain open to traffic. Bus routes would be diverted onto Connaught Road. The pedestrian zone would remain open to delivery vehicles and emergency services.\n\nWith huge support from different stakeholder groups, the Very DVRC Event was launched on 25 September 2016 to raise people's awareness of walkability and open space issues in Hong Kong. The successful one-day trial demonstrated that the closure of DVRC to most traffic can, indeed, be successfully accomplished without adverse impact on traffic and businesses.\n\nIn January 2017, Walk DVRC Ltd, an NGO, was set up to take this initiative forward.\n\nDes Voeux Road Central is shared between motor traffic and the tram line, with tracks and reserved lanes for the trams laid in the middle of the road. A bus lane runs along the road for most of its length. Part of the MTR Island Line also runs underneath Des Voeux Road.\n\nDue to the discontinuity between Des Voeux Roads Central and West, the tram line takes a detour along Connaught Road West and then continues along Des Voeux Road West towards Kennedy Town.\n\nThe Central-Mid-Levels escalators link Des Voeux Road Central with Conduit Road in the Mid-levels, passing through narrow streets.\n\nA street called Des Voeux Road existed in Kowloon along Hunghom Bay. The street no longer exists following extensive re-development of the area.\n\n\n"}

The word, \"Nishan\" means symbol, and the flag is hoisted on a tall flagpole, outside most Gurdwaras. The flagpole itself, covered with fabric, ends with a two-edged dagger (\"khanda\") on top. The emblem on the flag is also known as \"Khanda\", which depicts a double-edged sword called a khanda (☬) in the centre, a chakkar which is circular, and flanked by two single-edged swords, or kirpans.\n\nTraditional symbol of the Khalsa Panth (corps of initiated Sikhs), the Nishan Sahib can be seen from far away, signifying the presence of Khalsa in the neighbourhood. It is taken down every Baisakhi (harvest festival, mid-April in the Gregorian calendar), and replaced with a fresh flag, and the flagpole refurbished.\n\nDuring the times of Guru Amar Das the Nishan Sahib was white, to represent peace and simplicity. During the time of Guru Hargobind, however the Nishan Sahib changed into a shade of yellow, known as Basanti. After the creation of Khalsa, Guru Gobind Singh introduced blue flag, which is still the colour of the Nihang flags. The first Sikh flags were plain, but emblems were introduced by Guru Gobind Singh. The first Sikh emblem, was not the Khanda, but the three weapons, the Kattar (dagger), Dhal (shield) and Kirpan (sabre). Later these emblems were also used by the Sikh misls and the Empire. During the time of Ranjit Singh of Punjab, the Sikh flag became red or deep orange. \nThe Nishan Sahib is placed outside most Sikh Gurdwaras and is supported by a pole of timber or metal.\n\nThe Khanda, a Sikh symbol, is rendered in blue on the saffron background. The khanda is placed high up on a flagpole as a sign for all Sikhs and indeed any other people that they can come and pray in this building. Great respect is shown to this flag and the flag is considered sacred and washed using milk and water every year in April at the festival of Vaisakhi. The Nishan Sahib is changed once the saffron color has faded.\n\nLike a Flag of any institution, this Flag symbolizes the presence of the Khalsa and hence is hoisted at every Gurdwara premises. Therefore, anybody in need of help, however with the Khalsa now being in non-war status, but always functional, the Gurdwaras serve the purpose of congregational meeting, Langar and lodging.\n\n"}

She is one of few Italian musicians to write and record mainly in English. She draws inspiration from many genres such as pop, alternative rock, electronica and trip hop. In Europe she is perhaps most recognised for the single \"Come Speak to Me\", while American audiences may recognise the song \"Dancing\" as featured in both the 2006 and 2007 seasons of \"So You Think You Can Dance\". On December 18, 2012, her collaboration with Ennio Morricone, \"Ancora qui\", was featured on Quentin Tarantino's film, \"Django Unchained\" and its soundtrack album, which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media.\n\nShe has released nine studio albums, five compilations, two live albums, eight video album and 51 singles, selling over 5,5 million copies in Italy, certified by M&D and FIMI with a diamond disc, a multiplatinum disc, 25 platinum and four gold certifications.\n\nShe earned six awards at the Sanremo Music Festival in 2001, one Targa Tenco, two Lunezia Awards, 13 Italian, Wind & Music Awards, one award at the Festivalbar, one Nastro d'argento, and several other awards, including an MTV Europe Music Award.\n\nElisa Toffoli was born on December 19, 1977 in Trieste in north-eastern Italy. She grew up in Monfalcone (27 km from Trieste, 25 km from Gorizia, 15 km from Slovenia, 120 km from Austria). Living in a border-area, where she had the opportunity to listen to different languages and experience various cultures, was important for Elisa's later inspirations and helped her develop a high aptitude to sing in multiple languages. \nHer early influences include Björk, PJ Harvey, Tori Amos, Aretha Franklin and Ella Fitzgerald, while she has credited Rudyard Kipling and Jim Morrison of The Doors as lyrical inspirators. She began writing songs at the age of 11 and later played in several local bands. At 15 she appeared in a karaoke TV program, \"Karaoke\" hosted by Rosario Fiorello.\n\nAt 16, Elisa met Caterina Caselli, who one year later signed her to the record company Sugar. At 18 she left for Berkeley, California (US) to work on songs for her debut album with record producer Corrado Rustici, who has also worked with Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and Zucchero among others.\n\nElisa's first single \"Sleeping in Your Hand\" was released in late May 1997, followed by her debut album \"Pipes & Flowers\" on September 22. She was credited as a writer or co-writer on all tracks. The album soon went quadruple platinum in Italy and won her two prizes: \"Targa Tenco\" and \"PIM\" (Premio Italiano della Musica). She was also a special guest on Eros Ramazzotti's European tour. In 1998, the re-release of \"Pipes and Flowers\" included a new track, \"Cure Me\", recorded in Venice with British producer Darren Allison (Spiritualized, Belle and Sebastian).\n\nMay 5, 2000 saw the release of \"Asile's World\" (\"Asile\" being \"Elisa\" written backwards). The album took a new turn in terms of musical influences and featured songs produced by Howie B, Roberto Vernetti, Mauro Malavasi and Leo Z.\n\nIn September 2000 Elisa recorded her first song in Italian, \"Luce (Tramonti a nord est)\". The song was initially written in English, but an Italian lyric was written in collaboration with fellow singer Zucchero. The song was performed at the 2001 Sanremo Festival supported by the Solis String Quartet, and won her the \"Critics' Award\", \"Interpreter of the Year\" as well as the competition altogether. Both Italian and English versions were later included in a re-release of \"Asile's World\". In November she was awarded three prizes at the Italian Music Awards: \"Best female artist\", \"Best single\" (\"Luce\") and \"Best song\", as well as taking home the \"Best Italian Artist\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2001 in Frankfurt. She also received Premio Italiano della Musica's \"Best Female Artist\" and \"Best Single\" (\"Luce\").\n\nElisa's third album, \"Then Comes the Sun\" was released on November 9, 2001 with Rustici returning as producer. The album saw a return to a more pop/rock sound and went triple platinum. The following year she performed both at the closing of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah singing a jazzy version of the Italian national hymn, and at the 2002 \"Pavarotti and Friends\" concert, singing \"Voglio vivere così (col sole in fronte)\" with the world-famous tenor.\n\nIn August 2002 Sugar released an International album simply entitled \"Elisa\". The album is a selection of songs from her first three albums fronted by \"Come Speak to Me\", the original English version of her hit \"Luce\". The single received high rotation on MTV Europe as well as fair airplay and moderate attention in several European countries, but still failed to establish Elisa as an international artist.\n\nIn late 2003 Elisa released the album \"Lotus\", an acoustic album featuring new, stripped-down versions of some of her songs as well as a handful of new ones including a cover version of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\". The album was followed by an extensive acoustic Italian tour as well as a double DVD set consisting of an \"MTV Supersonic\" concert and \"The making of Lotus\".\n\nElisa's fourth studio album \"Pearl Days\" was released on October 15, 2004. All tracks were produced by Glen Ballard, known for producing Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill and tracks for artists such as Anastacia, Michael Jackson, Shakira, Christina Aguilera and The Corrs. The album was more rock-influenced and sported more electric guitars than her earlier records. One of the songs, \"Life Goes On\", was later translated to Italian (\"Una poesia anche per te\") and became the fourth best selling single in Italy in 2005. The single was accompanied by a self-directed video which won the \"Premio Video Italiano\" for \"Best Female Artist\". In the summer of 2005, Elisa appeared at the Live 8 concert in Rome alongside Zucchero, Luciano Ligabue and other major Italian artists.\n\nTwo non-album singles were released in 2005 and 2006, \"Swan\" and \"Teach Me Again\" (duet with Tina Turner). Both supported major Italian films, namely \"Melissa P.\" and \"All the Invisible Children\" (Segment 9: \"Song Song & Little Cat\" directed by John Woo). Elisa also performed \"Luce (Tramonti a nord est)\" at the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Torino.\n\nOn November 17, 2006 \"Soundtrack '96-'06\" was released, a collection of hits through her first ten years as a recording artist. The album also contained four new songs; three in Italian and one in English. The album peaked at number 1, was certified diamond and became the third most selling album of 2006 in Italy with more than of 700,000 copies. A revised edition entitled \"Caterpillar\" was released in September 2007, aimed at the International market. Several of the songs had been remixed, rearranged and partly rerecorded and it featured an entirely new cover version of The Rolling Stones \"Wild Horses\". The box set \"Soundtrack Live '96-'06\" was released on November 23, 2007, containing a CD and DVD from a Milan concert during the \"Soundtrack Live Tour 2007\".\n\nIn the wake of Elisa's increased popularity due to her song \"Dancing\" appearing on \"So You Think You Can Dance\", yet another compilation album appropriately named \"Dancing\" was released in the US on July 15, 2008. Being the singer's first album to be available in the US, it is recognised as her American debut.\n\nElisa released her next album, \"Heart\", on November 13, 2009. The first single was \"Ti vorrei sollevare\" with Giuliano Sangiorgi from Italian rock band Negramaro. The album also contains a collaboration with Antony Hegarty from Antony and the Johnsons in the song \"Forgiveness\".\n\nOn November 30, 2010 Elisa released \"Ivy\", an album in the same vein as Lotus, featuring 3 new tracks, acoustic versions of her past songs and covers such as Smashing Pumpkins' \"1979\". The album sold over 80.000 copies in Italy and was further supported by a tour.\n\nIn 2012, the song \"Love Is Requited\", written by Andrea Guerra and Michele von Buren for the soundtrack of Roberto Faenza's film \"Someday This Pain Will Be Useful to You\" and performed by Elisa, received a Nastro d'Argento for Best Original Song. On December 18, 2012, her collaboration with Ennio Morricone, \"Ancora qui\", was featured on Quentin Tarantino's film, \"Django Unchained\" and its soundtrack album.\n\nOn October 15, 2013, L'anima vola, Elisa's first album recorded entirely in Italian was released. In early August, the album was certified double platinum by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry. Elisa was featured on a special version of \"We Are Incurable Romantics\" by Belgian singer Ozark Henry, which was released in the Italian iTunes store on July 15, 2014.\nOn September 1, 2017, the compilation Soundtrack '97-'17 will be released to celebrate her 20 years of career.\n\nOn January 14, 2016, Elisa announced her ninth studio album, On, which was released on March 25, 2016. \"No Hero\" serves as the lead single off the album.\n\nElisa released her tenth studio album Diari Aperti through Universal Music Group on October 26, 2018. The album's lead single, \"Se Piovesse Il Tuo Nome\", peaked at number four on the FIMI Italian chart and at number one on the Italian Airplay Chart for nine weeks.\nIn January 2019, Elisa released the second single, \"Anche Fragile\". In May, \"Vivere tutte le vite\" featuring rapper Carl Brave was released as the album's third single.\n\nElisa followed up Diari Aperti with the EP Secret Diaries, which was released on June 3, 2019. The EP features five new tracks, all of them written in english.\n\nIn June 2019 she was featured on Imagine Dragons's song \"Birds\", the fifth single from their fourth album \"Origins\".\n\nElisa and Andrea Rigonat (guitarist and band member) had their first child Emma Cecile on October 22, 2009. The second one, Sebastian, was born on May 20, 2013. They married in Grado on September 5, 2015.\n\n"}

{"id": "2200870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200870", "title": "Joi Cardwell", "text": "Joi Cardwell\n\nJoi Cardwell (born October 8, 1967) is an American singer-songwriter, author, holistic health coach. Born and raised in New York City, she performed in various singing competitions as a child and rose to fame in the early 1990s as guest vocalist for Lil Louis on the number 1 Dance singles \"Club Lonely\" and \"Saved My Life\". The release of Cardwell's debut album, \"The World Is Full of Trouble\" (1995), established her as a solo artist worldwide and featured the \"Billboard\" Dance top-five singles number-one singles \"Jump for Joi\" and \"Love & Devotion\". Her second album, \"Joi Cardwell\" (1997), spawned the top-charting singles \"Soul to Bare\", \"Run to You\", and \"Found Love\".\n\nIn 1999, she released her third album \"Deliverance\" on her own record label No-Mad Industries. Her fourth album, \"The Plain Jane Project\" (2005), yielded the top-ten singles \"Freedom\" and \"It's Over\". She continued to release albums on her recording label including \"Wanderlust (The Soundtrack)\" (2009) and \"Must Be the Music\" (2011). In 2014, Cardwell resurfaced with her seventh album \"The Art of Being\", which was released on her new recording label Curly Gurly Records.\n\nIn 2016, \"Billboard\" magazine ranked her at No. 43 amongst the Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists.\n\nBorn in New York City in the late-1960s and raised in various areas of Queens. Cardwell appeared on stage at Carnegie Hall at the age of five in a dance recital, and was used to being on a stage by the time she was a teenager. She worked as a back-up session singer for Melba Moore, Jermaine Jackson, LL Cool J, and The Pointer Sisters. After graduating from New York University with degrees in English and Music in the mid-1980s, she studied voice for a year primarily to master control, as she had already developed and retained her own personal style. After her studies, she wrote and published songs for major R&B acts such as Kashif, L.A. Posse, and Malika Thomas.\n\nHer close affiliation with Kashif led to an album deal with Arista Records in 1988 for her pop R&B girl-group, The Promise. Since the market in the 1980s was already saturated with sweet-sounding, bubbly R&B groups, it was difficult for The Promise to stand. As a result, Cardwell decided to answer an ad in the Village Voice that read, \"Epic recording artist looking for a background singer for a live tour.\" The recording artist turned out to be house-music innovator Lil Louis. She recorded two songs; \"Club Lonely\" and \"Saved My Life\" for Lil Louis' album \"Journey with the Lonely\", which both peaked at number 1 on \"Billboard's\" Dance Club Songs chart.\n\nCardwell's experience as a vocalist and songwriter turned out to be exactly what Lil Louis had been searching for in a singer. He proved to be an early influence for Cardwell's sound, which melds a new dance beat with a thoughtful lyrical twist. Cardwell creates material that sounds as though she's musing quietly about life while a dancing throng gyrates with joy nearby, and her lyrics are soulful, romantic, and thought-provoking. Shortly after meeting Lil Louis, Cardwell conceived the single \"Dancing in My Sleep\", and within a week of penning it, she was in Chicago cutting demos and well on her way to a career as a dance-hall diva and R&B songstress. When \"Club Lonely\" reached the number one mark, Cardwell distanced herself from the Lil Louis project. In 1993, she toured in Japan for eight months as a background singer for Japanese soul singer Toshinobu Kubota. Cardwell gleaned experience from the large overseas tour returned to the U.S. significantly more focused and ready to tackle a solo singing career.\n\nIn 1994, Cardwell signed a recording contract with Eightball Records, an independent label based in New York. In 1994, Cardwell released her first single \"Trouble\" on Eight Ball Records, which was a double-pack single including remixes from Junior Vasquez, Sotoshi Tomiie, and Deep Dish. The song charted at number 11 on the Dance chart. She also released a non-album single \"Holdin' On\" with Jay Mac. Her first solo album \"The World Is Full of Trouble\" was released on May 15, 1995. The album spawned the top-charted singles \"Jump for Joi\" and \"Love & Devotion\". In 1995, she recorded the single \"Luv Connection\" for Towa Tei's album \"Future Listening!\". Cardwell contributed guest vocals on the single \"The Creator Has A Master Plan\" for the Brooklyn Funk Essentials' album \"Cool & Steady & Easy\". She also toured with the group throughout the year. In 1996, she toured as a backing vocalist for Toshinobu Kubota on the Oyeees! Tour. In July 1996, she released the single \"You Got to Pray\". The single peaked at number 1 on Billboard's Dance Club Play chart.\n\nCardwell's eponymous second solo album \"Joi Cardwell\" was released on November 11, 1997, in the US. The album's lead single \"Soul to Bare\" reached the top five on the Billboard Dance Club Play chart. The second international single \"Run to You\" was a commercial success, reaching number one in the United States. The album also produced two other singles; \"Found Love\" and \"Power\". By December 1997, Cardwell had sold a total of over 1.5 million records worldwide. In 1998, Cardwell left Eightball Records. In November 1998, she released a two-disc compilation \"Clubland's Greatest Hits\" which features a few club mixes of her earlier singles on Eightball Records.\n\nIn April 1999, Cardwell self-produced and released the lead single \"Last Chance for Love\" of her forthcoming album. The song peaked at number 17 on the Dance Club chart. She later released her third album \"Deliverance\" on her new independent recording label \"No-Mad Industries\". A second single \"Superstar\", an interpretation of Delaney & Bonnie's \"Superstar\", was also released. In 2000, \"Last Chance for Love\" won for \"Best Dance Song\" by the GLAMA Awards. In February 2000, a remixed version of \"Jump for Joi\" was released on Nervous Records. The remix single peaked at number 7 on the Dance Club chart. In 2001, she toured again as a background vocalist for her long-time friend Toshinobu Kubota during the Nothing But As One Tour.\n\nIn September 2003, Cardwell released a compilation album \"More (1992–2003)\", which featured unreleased songs and new remixes. The album spawned the singles \"After the Rain\" and \"If You're Ever Lonely\", which were released on her manager's label, Junior Vasquez Music. In 2004, she participated in the Keep Hope Alive Project to benefit LIFEbeat, the music industry AIDS-awareness organization. Cardwell appeared alongside other house-genre singers on the song \"Keep Hope Alive\" and she also co-wrote and recorded a song \"Be Yourself\", which appear on the \"Underground Dance Artists United For Life: Keep Hope Alive\" album. In 2004, she released her greatest hits album entitled \"Hits and More\".\n\nOn November 18, 2005, Cardwell released her fourth studio album, \"The Plain Jane Project\". The album features more R&B-styled songs as opposed to her earlier electronic dance and house records. The album's lead single \"Freedom\" spent thirteen weeks on the Dance Club Play chart before peaking at number 7. The second single \"It's Over\" peaked at number 4 on the chart. The album's final single \"What It Feels Like\" peaked at number 30 on the Dance chart.\n\nHer compilation album \"A Beautiful Life\" was released on May 7, 2007 in Japan-only. The eleven-track album featured a combination of past singles and DJ mixes. On April 7, 2009, she released her fifth album \"Wanderlust (The Soundtrack)\". The album spawn the singles \"Imperfect\", \"Happy\", \"People Make the World Go Round\", \"Come Together\", \"Change the World\", and \"What's Freedom\". Her single \"People Make The World Go Round\" received an IDMA Awards' nomination for \"Best House/Garage Track\".\n\nIn June 2010, she released a maxi-single \"All Night\", which features the original version and various remixes of the song. A single \"We Got the Night\" was released, which featured production and mixing by Chus & Ceballos and DJ Koutarou.A. Caldwell released her sixth album \"Must Be the Music\" on March 19, 2011. In July 2011, she released her original song \"How Deep Is Your Love?\".\n\nIn 2013, she released a single \"Love Somebody Else\", which earned an IDMA award for \"Best House/Garage/Deep House Track of the Year\". In September 2014, Cardwell released her seventh album \"The Art of Being\" on her own independent recording label Curly Gurly Records. The album spawned the singles \"Return to Love\", \"Feels Like Heaven\", \"Indian Giver\", \"Lucky Charm\", \"Shot through the Heart\", and new remix of \"Jump 4 Joi\".\n\nIn 2016, Cardwell released a single \"What Love's Gonna Do\". In May 2017, she re-released her business book titled \"Keep Your Eye on the Game and Not the Fame\", which was originally released in 2001. On May 26, 2017, Cardwell announced through her Facebook that she would be retiring from the music industry, following a few more music releases and that she would open a wellness center. On June 2, 2017, she released a single called \"We Can Do Better\". In collaboration with DJ Gomi, a maxi-single was released featuring six remixed version of \"We Can Do Better\". On June 16, 2017, Cardwell released another single titled \"Days of Our Lives\".\n\nIn March 2018, Cardwell released a new version of her single titled \"Trouble 2018\". On June 1, 2018, Cardwell released her eighth album \"Pride and Joi\". The album contained new remixes of her previous singles.\n\nCardwell's voice is a mezzo-soprano despite sometimes being classified as an alto. Barry Walters of \"The Advocate\" highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, described her voice as \"more subtle, more ethereal and seductive.\" Other critics praise her vocal abilities, with Larry Flick of \"Billboard\" saying she \"proved her potential as a multiformat star with a funk version of \"Jump for Joi\" that exploded with Ella Fitzgerald-style scatting.\"\n\nCardwell's music is generally house, but she also incorporates traditional jazz, funk, and blues into her songs. \"Deliverance\" demonstrated Cardwell's exploration of neo soul, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases. While she exclusively releases English songs, Cardwell have performed several Japanese songs for Toshinobu Kubota (as a backup singer during his concert tours for a Japanese audience). To perform them, Cardwell was coached progressively by Kubota.\n\nShe has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Lil Louis and her solo efforts. Her songs were personally driven by dance themed compositions like \"Run to You\" and \"You Got to Pray\". Cardwell believes that, \"Lyrics have to be meaningful and memorable enough that people will insist on keeping the vocals on the tracks.\" She has also received production credits for many of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts. As an accomplished pianist, Cardwell incorporates piano into a majority of her songs and often writes about love. She also played a violin, and piano, on the song \"Brittany\" for Lil Louis' album \"From the Mind of Lil Louis\".\n\nHer musical influences included Billie Holiday, Barbra Streisand, and Minnie Riperton. Cardwell credits Ashford and Simpson, Marvin Gaye, and Curtis Mayfield as her songwriting influences. Her influences also include Sarah Vaughn and Donna Summer, the latter of whom she has been compared to.\n\nIn 2017, Cardwell announced her plans to open a wellness center. She later earned certifications in yoga, meditation, and as a holistic health coach. She also trained in trauma informed practices, yoga as a peace practice, and yoga nidra. In 2019, Cardwell opened the Jump for Joi Wellness Center in West Palm Beach, Florida. The wellness center offers classes and programs in gentle yoga, asana, yoga nidra, pre-natal yoga, and guided meditation for children.\n\n\nHeadlining\n\nSupporting\n\n\n\n"}

A manufactured form is used to treat kidney disease with low blood calcium, hyperparathyroidism due to kidney disease, low blood calcium due to hypoparathyroidism, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and familial hypophosphatemia. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein.\nExcessive amount commonly results in weakness, headache, nausea, constipation, urinary tract infections, and abdominal pain. Serious side effects may include high blood calcium and anaphylaxis. Regular blood tests are recommended after the medication is started and when the dose is changed. Calcitriol increases blood calcium (Ca) mainly by increasing the uptake of calcium from the intestines.\nCalcitriol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1978. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 9.70 £ as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$27. In 2017, it was the 256th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions.\n\nCalcitriol is prescribed for:\n\nCalcitriol has been used in an ointment for the treatment of psoriasis, although the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol (calcipotriene) is more commonly used. Calcitriol has also been given by mouth for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Research on the noncalcemic actions of calcitriol and other VDR-ligand analogs and their possible therapeutic applications has been reviewed.\n\nThe main adverse drug reaction associated with calcitriol therapy is hypercalcemia – early symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, constipation, anorexia, apathy, headache, thirst, pruritus, sweating, and/or polyuria. Compared to other vitamin D compounds in clinical use (cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol), calcitriol has a higher risk of inducing hypercalcemia. However, such episodes may be shorter and easier to treat due to its relatively short half-life.\n\nCalcitriol increases blood calcium levels ([]) by: \n\nCalcitriol acts in concert with parathyroid hormone (PTH) in all three of these roles. For instance, PTH also indirectly stimulates osteoclasts. However, the main effect of PTH is to increase the rate at which the kidneys excrete inorganic phosphate (P), the counterion of . The resulting decrease in serum phosphate causes hydroxyapatite (Ca(PO)OH) to dissolve out of bone thus increasing serum calcium. PTH also stimulates the production of calcitriol (see below).\n\nMany of the effects of calcitriol are mediated by its interaction with the calcitriol receptor, also called the vitamin D receptor or VDR. For instance, the unbound inactive form of the calcitriol receptor in intestinal epithelial cells resides in the cytoplasm. When calcitriol binds to the receptor, the ligand-receptor complex translocates to the cell nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor promoting the expression of a gene encoding a calcium binding protein. The levels of the calcium binding protein increase enabling the cells to actively transport more calcium () from the intestine across the intestinal mucosa into the blood.\n\nThe maintenance of electroneutrality requires that the transport of ions catalyzed by the intestinal epithelial cells be accompanied by counterions, primarily inorganic phosphate. Thus calcitriol also stimulates the intestinal absorption of phosphate.\n\nThe observation that calcitriol stimulates the release of calcium from bone seems contradictory, given that sufficient levels of serum calcitriol generally prevent overall loss of calcium from bone. It is believed that the increased levels of serum calcium resulting from calcitriol-stimulated intestinal uptake causes bone to take up more calcium than it loses by hormonal stimulation of osteoclasts. Only when there are conditions, such as dietary calcium deficiency or defects in intestinal transport, which result in a reduction of serum calcium does an overall loss of calcium from bone occur.\n\nCalcitriol also inhibits the release of calcitonin, a hormone which reduces blood calcium primarily by inhibiting calcium release from bone.\n\nCalcitriol is produced in the cells of the proximal tubule of the nephron in the kidneys by the action of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1-alpha-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial oxygenase and an enzyme which catalyzes the hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol) in the 1-alpha position.\n\nThe activity of this enzyme is stimulated by PTH. This is an important control point in Ca homeostasis. Additional effects on the production of calcitriol include an increase by prolactin, a hormone which stimulates lactogenesis (the formation of milk in mammary glands), a process which requires large amounts of calcium. Activity is also decreased by high levels of serum phosphate and by an increase in the production of the hormone FGF23 by osteocyte cells in bone.\n\nCalcitriol is also produced outside the kidney in small amounts by many other tissues including placenta and activated macrophages.\n\nWhen the drug alfacalcidol is used, 25-hydroxylation in the liver will produce calcitriol as the active metabolite. This will produce greater effects than other vitamin D precursors in patients with kidney disease who have loss of the renal 1-alpha-hydroxylase.\n\nCalcitriol's lifespan in the body is measured in hours, unlike its precursor calcifediol whose lifespan is measured in weeks. Calcitriol is inactivated by further hydroxylation to form 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D, calcitroic acid. This occurs through the action of the CYP24A1 24-hydroxylase. Calcitroic acid is more soluble in water and is excreted in bile and urine.\n\nIt was first identified in 1971 by Michael F. Holick working in the laboratory of Hector DeLuca, and also by Tony Norman and colleagues.\n\nCalcitriol usually refers specifically to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Because cholecalciferol already has one hydroxyl group, only two (1,25) are further specified in this nomenclature, but there are three (1,3,25-triol), as indicated in when \"calcitriol\" is used. The 1-hydroxy group is in the alpha position, and this may be specified in the name, for instance in the abbreviation 1α,25-(OH)D.\n\nCalcitriol is, strictly, the 1-hydroxylation product of calcifediol (25-OH vitamin D), derived from cholecalciferol (vitamin D), rather than the product of hydroxylations of ergocalciferol (vitamin D). 1α,25-Dihydroxyergocalciferol (ercalcitriol) should be used for the vitamin D product. However, the terminology of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or 1,25(OH)D, is often used to refer to both types of active forms of vitamin D. Indeed, both bind to the vitamin D receptor and produce biological effects. In clinical use, the differences are unlikely to have major importance.\n\nCalcitriol is marketed as a pharmaceutical for medical use under various trade names including Rocaltrol (Roche), Calcijex (Abbott), Decostriol (Mibe, Jesalis), Vectical (Galderma), and Rolsical (Sun Pharma).\n"}
{"id": "2200874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200874", "title": "Bloating", "text": "Bloating\n\nAbdominal bloating is a symptom that can appear at any age, generally associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders or organic diseases, but can also appear alone. The person feels a full and tight abdomen. Although this term is usually used interchangeably with abdominal distension, these symptoms probably have different pathophysiological processes, which are not fully understood.\n\nThe first step for the management is to find a treatment for the underlying causes that produce it through a detailed medical history and a physical examination. The discomfort can be alleviated by the use of certain drugs and dietary modifications.\n\nThe most common symptoms associated with bloating is a sensation that the abdomen is full or distended. Rarely, bloating may be painful or cause shortness of breath.\n\nPains that are due to bloating will feel sharp and cause the stomach to cramp. These pains may occur anywhere in the body and can change locations quickly. They are so painful that they are sometimes mistaken for heart pains when they develop on the upper left side of the chest. Pains on the right side are often confused with problems in the appendix or the gallbladder.\n\nOne symptom of gas that is not normally associated with it is the hiccup. Hiccups are harmless and will diminish on their own; they also help to release gas that is in the digestive tract before it moves down to the intestines and causes bloating. Important but uncommon causes of abdominal bloating include ascites and tumors.\n\nThere are many causes of bloating, including: diet, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, reflux, and constipation. \n\nSpecific medical conditions like Crohn's disease or bowel obstruction can also contribute to the amount of stomach bloating experienced.\n\nCommon causes of abdominal bloating are:\n\n\nImportant but uncommon causes of abdominal bloating include:\n\n\nIn animals, causes of abdominal bloating include:\n\nMost cases of stomach bloating are due to improper diet. Gas occurs because of the bacteria in the colon and is a by-product of soluble fiber digestion. Inadequate or irregular intake of fiber and water will cause a person to experience bloating or constipation. The most common natural sources of fiber include fruits and vegetables as well as wheat or oat bran. These fibers are most likely to cause flatulence. Fiber is made by plants and is not easily digested by the human gastrointestinal tract. There are two main types of dietary fiber: soluble and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber is prebiotic and readily fermented in the colon into gases, while insoluble fiber is metabolically inert and absorbs water as it moves through the digestive system, aiding in defecation. Most types of fiber (insoluble) are attached to body water in the intestine and increase the volume of stools.\n\nGas in the gastrointestinal tract has only two sources. It is either swallowed air or is produced by bacteria that normally inhabit the intestines, primarily the colon.\n\nBelching or burping is a universal ability that works by removing gas from the stomach through the mouth. The stomach can become bloated when too much air is swallowed during eating and drinking too quickly. As the stomach swells, belching removes the gas and alleviates the pain associated with it. Burping can also be used as a form of relief from abdominal discomfort other than too much gas in the stomach.\n\nFlatulence or farting works much like burping, but helps the body pass gas through the anus, not the mouth. Bacteria present in the intestinal tract cause gas to be expelled from the anus. They produce the gas as food is digested and moved from the small intestine. This gas builds up and causes swelling or bloating in the abdominal area before it is released.\n\nA common gastrointestinal problem is constipation—infrequent bowel movements, hard stools, or strain during the movements—which causes serious cases of bloating. Since most cases of constipation are temporary, simple lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise and increasing one's intake of fiber, can go a long way toward alleviating constipation. Some cases of constipation will continue to worsen and require unconventional methods to release the feces and reduce the amount of stomach bloating. Blood in the stool, intense pain in the abdomen, rectal pain, and unexplained weight loss should be reported to a doctor. Bloating consistently accompanies constipation, and they will not develop without an underlying cause. \n\nPainful burning sensations in the chest that is caused by gastroesophageal reflux is known as heartburn. Reflux is the back flow of gastric acid juices from the stomach into the oesophagus. Heartburn has different triggers, including certain foods, medications, obesity, and stress. These triggers are different for each individual. Gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD is a chronic condition that can lead to more serious complications like esophageal cancer. Treatment options are available to treat the symptoms and the condition, but there is no cure for the disease. Symptoms include burping, abdominal and stomach bloating, along with pain and discomfort. Heavy meals, lying down or bending over after eating should be avoided to help prevent reflux from occurring. The stomach bloating experienced with reflux is intense and will remain until the food is digested all the way.\n\nPostmortem bloating occurs in cadavers, due to the formation of gases by bacterial action and putrefaction of the internal tissues of the abdomen and the inside of the intestines.\n\nConditions that are related to bloating include constipation, lactose intolerance, and acid reflux disease. All of these conditions share the same symptoms and can share the same causative agents. These causes include unhealthy diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, low amount of exercise, and overall health. Each of these conditions can be experienced as a symptom of the others and is also a cause for each of them. In most cases where one of the conditions is present, there is at least one if not two of the others. Treatment for each condition is performed using the same medications and recommended dietary changes like increased fiber intake and reduced fat intake. If the conditions develop into disease such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or chronic constipation, additional medications will be required. Bloating and flatulence are sometimes related to constipation, and treating the underlying condition may be helpful.\n\nThere are many over-the-counter (OTC) medications that can be used to treat bloating. \nFood enzymes can be found in some products that will help break down the sugars found in grains, vegetables and dairy products. They can be taken before food is consumed or added to the food that causes the gas and bloating. The most common treatment is antacids. These medications have no effect on the gas that is presently in the intestines, but enable gas build-up to be belched away more easily, reducing the amount of bloating that develops. Another treatment is Simethicone, an oral anti-foaming agent that helps the body to expel the gas more quickly.\nAlso combinations of prokinetics, such as domperidone + metoclopramide + diphenhydramine (the latter for the prevention of extrapyramidal reactions, especially acute dystonic reactions) + proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), have dramatic effects on bloaters and belchers especially.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2200875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200875", "title": "Tournament (solitaire)", "text": "Tournament (solitaire)\n\nTournament is a solitaire card game which uses two decks of playing cards shuffled together. Despite the name, the game play doesn't seem to be related to the word \"tournament\".\n\nFirst, the cards are shuffled and dealt as two columns of four cards laid out. The player must make sure that these eight cards include either a king, an ace, or both. If neither a king nor an ace is found among these eight cards, all cards are collected and shuffled and two new columns of four cards are dealt. As long there is no king or ace among the eight cards, the shuffling and dealing continues. When at least a king or an ace are present, six columns of four cards are then dealt. At least a king or an ace must be present among the first eight cards for the game to work. The first eight cards compose the reserve (or \"the kibitzers\") and the six columns of four cards form the tableau (or \"the dormitzers\").\n\nThe object of the game is to free one king and one ace of each suit and built them by suit. The kings should be built down while the aces should be built up.\n\nThe top cards of each column on the tableau and all eight cards on the reserve are available. \n\nThe cards on the reserve are available to be built on the foundations, and any space it leaves behind are filled from any from the tableau. But filling spaces doesn't have to be done immediately; it is the player's discretion on whether to fill a gap or leave it open.\n\nThe cards on the tableau are available only to be built on the foundation or placed on a space in the reserve; they are not built on each other. In case there is a gap resulting on all cards on the column leaving it, it is immediately filled by a new set of four cards.\n\nFurthermore, the top cards of foundations are available to be built on each other, handy when the two foundations of the same suit meet.\n\nWhen the player has made all the moves one could make, four cards from the stock are deal onto each column. Then game play continues. Dealing of new cards and making of new moves continue until all cards have been played.\n\nAfter the game play goes on a standstill, the player then collects all the cards on the tableau by first gathering the rightmost column and placing it on the pile to its left, and then placing this new pile to the pile on its left and so on. Then, without shuffling, six new columns of four cards each are dealt. And game play continues as before. This can be done twice in the game.\n\nThe game is won when all cards are dealt onto the foundations.\n\nLa Nivernaise or just Nivernaise (also known as Napoleon's Flank) is an older version of Tournament. It is played exactly as Tournament except the six columns of four cards each are just piles with only their top cards exposed. Here, the reserve is the \"flank\" while the piles are the \"line.\"\n"}
{"id": "2200877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200877", "title": "Stuart Adamson", "text": "Stuart Adamson\n\nWilliam Stuart Adamson (11 April 1958 – 16 December 2001) was a Scottish guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter. He was the co-founder, lead vocalist, and guitarist of rock group Big Country, which rose to prominence in 1983.\n\nPrior to that he founded Scottish art-punk band Skids. In the late 1990s he founded alternative country rock act The Raphaels. He was once described by DJ John Peel as \"the new Jimi Hendrix\".\n\nAdamson was born in Manchester. Both his parents were Scottish, and when he was four, his family moved to Fife and settled in a small mining town, Crossgates, about a mile to the east of Dunfermline.\n\nAdamson founded his first two bands in Dunfermline and they both started out playing Dunfermline and across the Firth of Forth in Edinburgh. He went to school with Ian Rankin, who was two years younger and went on to become a fan of Skids. Adamson was a lifelong supporter of Dunfermline Athletic Football Club.\n\nAdamson's father was in the fishing industry and travelled the world. He encouraged Stuart to read literature, and both parents shared an interest in folk music. Adamson founded his first band, Tattoo, in 1976 after seeing The Damned play in Edinburgh. Besides Adamson, Tattoo included his friend William Simpson, who would also play bass guitar for his next band, Skids.\n\nAdamson founded Skids in 1977 when he was 18. Adamson and Simpson first recruited drummer Thomas Kellichan. They played as a trio around Dunfermline and Edinburgh until meeting 16-year-old Richard Jobson. Jobson was recruited as a frontman; Adamson and Jobson both wrote songs for the band.\n\nSkids' biggest success was the single \"Into the Valley\" in 1979, which reached number 10 in the UK charts. The band had four chart singles in the UK that year. Adamson was involved with three of their four albums, leaving in 1980 before \"Joy\". Jobson's influence had increased in the band, which led to the increasing disputes between the two musicians.\nJobson later said \"This was a guy who had a mortgage, a wife, and a family when we were all trying to live some mythic punk lifestyle. He seemed level-headed, grounded.\"\n\nAdamson came to greater international prominence with Big Country. He constructed the band with friend and fellow guitarist Bruce Watson, then employed as a cleaner on submarines at Rosyth naval base, and a rhythm section of studio musicians Mark Brzezicki and Tony Butler, whom he found with the help of his record company.\n\nBig Country's first hit, 1983's \"Fields of Fire\", reached the UK's Top 10, and was rapidly followed by the album \"The Crossing\". The album was a big hit in North America (Canada.#4, United States #18) powered by the single \"In a Big Country\", which was performed on Saturday Night Live and the Grammy Awards. The video for \"In a Big Country\" received frequent airplay on MTV and featured the band riding all terrain vehicles in the countryside.\n\nTheir second album \"Steeltown\" appeared in 1984. The band's third album was \"The Seer\". The first two albums were produced by Steve Lillywhite. The band continued to record studio albums and to tour until 1999. Adamson supplied much of the distinctive guitar work, as well as being the lead singer and main songwriter (both music and lyrics). The band's lineup rarely underwent changes, the exception being a brief departure of drummer Mark Brzezicki in the early 1990s and his temporary replacement by Pat Ahern.\n\nAdamson was married twice. He had two children with his first wife Sandra in 1982 and 1985. His son Callum Adamson is the guitarist of British band Ahab, and his daughter Kirsten has a solo musical career. In 1996, Adamson split with Sandra and moved to Nashville. There he married his second wife, Melanie Shelley a celebrity hairdresser in 1999, and founded his final band, the alternative country band The Raphaels, a duo of Adamson and Nashville songwriter Marcus Hummon.\n\nAdamson was a keen motorcyclist who regularly purchased new machines for riding around Fife. His interest extended to the race track where he sponsored the career of the British Championship rider Iain Duffus in the late 1980s.\nOn 26 November 2001, Adamson was reported missing by his wife Melanie. At the time the couple had been estranged for several weeks, and Melanie filed for divorce on the day he had disappeared. He had been due to face drunk-driving charges in March 2002, and had been ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous. He had previously experienced problems related to alcoholism, and had begun drinking again after having been sober for over a decade. On 16 December 2001 he was found dead in a room that he had booked into in the Best Western Plaza Hotel in Honolulu in Hawaii. According to a local police report he had died by suicide by hanging himself with an electrical cord from a pole in a wardrobe. A subsequent Coroner's Office report found that he had consumed a 'very strong' amount of alcohol around the time of his death.\n\nHis body was flown back to Scotland, where after a private funeral service at Dunfermline Crematorium in Fife, he was cremated. In the evening of 27 December 2001 a public memorial service was held to celebrate his life and career at Carnegie Hall, Dunfermline, attended by Richard Jobson and a crowd of several hundred mourners, including Adamson's family and friends, and former members of Big Country. Messages of condolence were publicly read out, including one from U2's The Edge, stating that Adamson with Big Country had written the songs that he wished U2 could write.\n\nIn April 2009, a mural of Stuart Adamson was unveiled at East End Park, the home of Dunfermline Athletic Football Club of whom Adamson was a fan: the mural was painted by art students from the local Queen Anne High and Dunfermline High Schools, and adorns the wall of the north stand.\n\nIn September 2011 a commemorative bench to Stuart Adamson was unveiled at Pittencrieff Park in Dunfermline. It was paid for by fans and is inscribed with some of his lyrics chosen by fans in an online poll.\n\nStuart Adamson was the inspiration behind the song \"3 Ways To See Despair\" by Manic Street Preachers.\n\nAccording to Skids bassist Bill Simpson, Adamson's first real guitar was a Gibson Flying V. He is usually associated with the Yamaha SG2000 guitar, which he used extensively during the Skids years, as well as on the first two Big Country albums. He also used Fender Stratocasters in this period to achieve lighter tones. Around the time of The Seer, Adamson began to lay his SG2000s aside and experimented with other models. Among these were several Les Pauls, a Gretsch Duo-Jet, and an ESP Model 901 Stratalike with humbucking pickups. Adamson also had several guitars made for him by the Glasgow guitar maker Jimmy Moon. Among these were a Telecaster-style electric that Adamson used live on songs such as \"The Teacher,\" \"Steeltown,\" and \"Just a Shadow.\"\n\nAdamson's distinctive \"Scottish\" sound was created using an MXR pitch transposer, which pushed the guitar notes up an octave and created a shrill, bagpipe-esque whine. This can be heard in the lead guitar passages in the song \"In a Big Country.\" Adamson was also noted for his use of the E-Bow, a device that magnetically vibrates guitar strings and generates unique tones with infinite sustain. The e-bow is most prominent in the introductions to the songs \"The Storm\" and \"Lost Patrol.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2200885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200885", "title": "Offenburg", "text": "Offenburg\n\nOffenburg (\"open borough\" - coat of arms showing open gates; Fr. \"Offenbourg\") is a city located in the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. With about 57,000 inhabitants (2013), it is the largest city and the administrative capital of the Ortenaukreis.\n\nIn recent times the remains of Roman settlements have been found within the city's territory. Offenburg was first mentioned in historical documents dating back to 1148. Offenburg had already been declared a Free Imperial City by 1240. In September 1689 the city - with the exception of two buildings - was totally destroyed by the French during the Nine Years War. Due to Napoleon's dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803 and subsequent reorganization of the German states, Offenburg lost its status as a Free Imperial City and fell under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Baden.\n\nDuring the outbreak of the Revolutions of 1848, the \"\"Offenburger Programm\"\" which consisted of thirteen demands \"in the name of the people of Baden\", was put forward at the Salmen Inn on 12 September 1847. This was the first known demand for democracy in Germany. Along with the Carlsbad Decrees, the Offenburger Program demanded basic and human rights as well as freedom of the press and a progressive income tax structure. On 19 March 1848 the demands were confirmed by the 20,000 member Offenburg Peoples' Assembly.\n\nDuring World War I Offenburg was one of the first cities to experience the effects of aerial bombardment, the operations against Offenburg railway sidings were mostly flown by aircraft from the Independent Force from Ochey aerodrome.\n\nIt is mostly forgotten, that in the aftermath of World War I, during the Occupation of the Ruhr, French troops occupied Offenburg, because it fell within the perimeter of the Kehl bridgehead. The French occupation forces entered the town in February 1923 and remained until 1924, blocking all traffic on the Rhine Valley Railway between Offenburg and Appenweier.\n\nFollowing the rise to power of the NSDAP in the 1930s and even in the pre-war era, Offenburg's Jewish population fell victim to acts of repression, that culminated in the vandalization of the local synagoge in November 1938. After the war had begun, those members of the Jewish population that had not managed to emigrate were deported to Gurs concentration camp in October 1940 and from there to Auschwitz during 1942.\n\nIn World War II, owing to its geographical proximity to the French border, Offenburg was either exposed to temporary evacuations during the Battle of France in 1940 or artillery fire towards the final stages of the conflict. It was only a primary target on one occasion during World War II on 27 November 1944, when a force of more than 300 USAAF B-17 and Liberator bombers attacked the marshalling yards. Many other tactical attacks were flown during 1944 and 1945 against the railway installations.\n\nFrench Forces entered Offenburg on 15 April 1945 and from then on Offenburg became part of the French Zone of Occupation until the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949.\n\nSince the creation of the Federal Republic, Offenburg has continually developed in size, inhabitants and prosperity. Between 1971 and 1975 eleven adjacent villages were incorporated into the commune of Offenburg and are now an integral part of the city.\n\n\n\nOffenburg is located approximately 15 km east of the river Rhine between Karlsruhe and Freiburg. The French city of Strasbourg lies 20 km northwest across the Rhine. Offenburg is situated at the mouth of the Kinzig river valley and at the foot of the Black Forest. The Kinzig flows out of the Black Forest and meets the Rhine near Kehl.\n\nKöppen climate classification classifies its climate as oceanic climate (Cfb). Marine features are limited however, as a result of its vast distance from oceans and seas. As a result, summers have a significant subtropical influence as the inland air heats up. Winters are moderate but usually with frequent frosts. The climate in this area is close to a Mediterranean climate with less precipitation in autumn and winter months, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. Offenburg is close to a humid subtropical (Cfa) climate due to the mean temperatures in summer just under 22 °C. Additionally, Offenburg is one of the warmest places in Germany and therefore considered as a viticultural area like neighbor villages such as Durbach, Oberkirch or Gengenbach.\n\nOffenburg has a rich trade and manufacturing sector and is home to a number of well-known brands.\n\nImportant manufacturing companies based at Offenburg include tesa-Werke Offenburg GmbH (adhesive tapes), Vivil (humbugs and sweets), MEIKO Maschinenbau GmbH & Co. KG (professional dishwashing systems, cleaning and desinfection technology), Hansgrohe SE (sanitary fittings) and HOBART GmbH (professional kitchen equipment). Besides, there are many other small and medium-sized companies that produce highly specialized top-of-the-line products in their appropriate sector of business. \n\nThe most important trading company in terms of employees (1,850) is EDEKA Handelsgesellschaft Südwest mbH, the largest German supermarket corporation which has a large regional production, storage and distribution centre in Offenburg. Printus GmbH with approx. 1,600 employees is a stationary wholesaling company. Several subsidiaries or affiliated companies of Markant AG (food and nonfood trade) are based in Offenburg with approx. 600 staff.\n\nHubert Burda Media is one of Germany's largest publishing companies. Together with the affiliated Burda printing works it still employs 1,600 people in Offenburg. \nAlthough the prominent position with regard to the number of employees has diminished during the last decades with the emerging of further economic actors in town, the expansion of Franz Burda's printing business after World War II as well as the growth and success of his wife Aenne Burda's Burda Style (formerly: \"Burda Moden\") have been decisive in developing the local economy after 1945 and in making the name of the city known all over the world.\n\nOwing to its favourable geographic situation Offenburg has been lying at the crossroads of important lines of communication that can be traced back to Roman times.\n\nOffenburg is situated 3 km east of the federal motorway A 5, to which it has been connected since 1960 via a famous egg-shaped junction.\nTwo major federal roads, B 3 and B 33, intersect at Offenburg.\n\nSince the construction of the railway line from Mannheim in 1844, Offenburg had developed into a railway centre during the 19th and earlier part of the 20th century. However, since the privatization of the Deutsche Bundesbahn in the early 1990s and the ensuing restructuring of the Deutsche Bahn AG, which subsequently led to the decommissioning of the railway workshops, the operations in Offenburg have considerably shrunk in size. \nToday Offenburg station lies at the crossroads of a number of railway lines, the most important being the Rhine Valley Railway, the main line between Karlsruhe and Basel with regular Intercity Express (ICE) services to Basel, Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt, Frankfurt Airport and Amsterdam. The picturesque Black Forest Railway starts at Offenburg as does the line to Strasbourg and the line serving the Rench valley in the Black Forest.\nDue to the re-routing of the TGV services from Freiburg to Paris-Est via Offenburg (instead of via Müllheim and Mulhouse) in December 2018, there has since been a daily (except Saturdays) direct service from Offenburg via Strasbourg to Paris-Est.\n\nOffenburg airfield (EDTO) has been used for flying purposes since 1911 and has received a paved runway in 1975. It is owned by the municipality. However, since its declassification as a publicly accessible airfield in the 1990s, the 910 metre asphalt runway (02-20) is only available to resident aeroclubs and to aircraft that have obtained prior permission from the operator. Airports in the vicinity are: Flughafen Lahr in Lahr (EDTL) and, with scheduled traffic, Strasbourg-Entzheim (LFST) and Baden-Söllingen (EDSB). Both, Lahr and Baden-Söllingen had formerly been used by the Canadian Forces in Europe and became available for civil use after the end of the Cold War.\nThe combination of an abundance of three well-equipped airports close by, the ever-growing noise sensitivity of residents as well as the necessity for commercial development areas has in 2012 revived discussions to shut down the aerodrome completely.\n\nApart from the primary and secondary schools that are within the responsibility of several public bodies, Offenburg houses a diverse number of educational institutions.\n\nOffenburg is also home to the University of Applied Sciences Offenburg, with its main campus location in Offenburg, and the other campus in Gengenbach (less than 12km away).\n\nThere are several historical attractions in Offenburg including:\n\n\nOffenburger FV is a German association football club based in the city of Offenburg, Baden-Württemberg. The club is one of the most successful amateur football clubs in Germany.\n\n\nOffenburg is twinned with:\n\n"}

The band was originally formed by Owl and Levannah as a duo called Ocean Road. On 11 March 2013, it was announced that Qkumba Zoo was officially a side project, and Owl joined with Simone to create Owl and Simone.\n\nThe band's 1996 song \"The Child (Inside)\" was a hit in the United States, reaching number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart\n\nQkumba Zoo's first release was titled \"BIG\", and it was released in South Africa on Gresham Records. At the time, the band's name was spelled 'Qcumba Zoo', and even Tziki's name was the elongated 'Tsatsiki'. The booklet contained a colourful, busy design, featuring original artwork from Tziki, and pictures from Qcumba's stage shows. The title track on \"BIG\" has slightly different music and vocals from its subsequent release on \"Wake Up & Dream\", and \"The Child (Inside)\" has a fading outro.\n\nTrack listing\n1.

As Levannah said, \"We wanted to form something that could be part of the global village. And, at the same time, have it be tied to its birthplace.\" This is apparent with Owl's fusion of tribal & synth, backed by Levannah's trilling vocals.\n\nTrack listing\n1. Rain \"(3:45)\"\n2.

It peaked on the Radio & Records contemporary hit radio charts at No. 34 on October 16, 1996. The 1996 Arista release of \"The Child (Inside)\" featured several mixes by DJ Junior Vasquez that became the standard for the song in American clubs. Vasquez followed up with several mixes of \"Cloud Eyes (I'm Scared You're Scared)\". In recent years, the original mix of \"The Child (Inside)\" has been used in several US television commercials, the most popular being from Seaworld parks and Carnival Cruise Lines.\n\nThe track \"Weeping\" was added to this release, the a cover of an anti-apartheid song by Bright Blue, another South African band. Bonus tracks are also provided on this album, including a musical remix of \"Mermaids\" and two stories/poems narrated by Levannah.\n\nIn August 1996, the group were the opening act for Danish singer Whigfield when she performed at the University of Port Elizabeth indoor sports centre.\n\nSeveral years after the release of the debut album, band member Tziki committed suicide. This was one of the catalysts that changed Owl and Levannah, which can be heard in the music of their second album, \"Butterfly Peepl\", released in 2000. In addition to the album's release, the band's name was officially shortened from \"Qkumba Zoo\" to \"QZoo\". The group also left Arista Records in favour of their own independent label, Zoocumba Music. The \"Butterfly Peepl\" release did not gain much attention, only having been for sale for a short time on QZoo's official site.\n\nTrack listing\n1. Beautiful \"(4:28)\"\n2.

It is most famous for serving as the filming site for the Twin Pines/Lone Pine Mall for the 1985 movie \"Back to the Future\" starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd.\n\nPuente Hills Mall was opened in phases over a year from February 1974 through Spring 1975. This was after the completion of the Pomona Freeway a few years earlier.\n\nThe first anchor to open, on February 18, 1974, was The Broadway, on three levels, 160,000 square Feet. J.W. Robinson's followed, opening in March. Sears followed, and by March 1975 the mall had about 150 shops open. JCPenney opened on April 16, 1975. By September 1975 the mall reported 152 shops open and announced plans for construction of an adjacent 41-acre auto mall and home improvement and home furnishings retail district.\n\nThe mall has a cross-shaped design and was developed by the The Hahn Company.\n\nIn 1996, two anchor stores, The Broadway (at the time purchased by Macy's) and JCPenney, were closed. At the time of JCPenney's departure, the mall had about a 50% occupancy. The mall was extensively renovated afterwards and features a 20-screen AMC Theatres megaplex, and stores traditionally found in power centers such as 24 Hour Fitness and Burlington Coat Factory, in addition to the remaining two original anchors, Macy's (formerly J.W Robinson's and Robinsons-May) and Sears. Ross Dress for Less, Circuit City, Linens 'n Things, Spectrum Club, Burlington Coat Factory, and CompUSA all opened in 1998. Linens 'n Things, Circuit City, and CompUSA all closed their locations at the mall in 2008 and 2009. Circuit City and CompUSA had both gone bankrupt while Linens 'n Things was closed as part of a strategy to focus on online shopping. \n\nOn August 28, 2010, the Japanese sports entertainment chain Round1 opened the first U.S. location of Round1 Bowling & Amusement, a video game arcade and bowling alley, as a new anchor. It was the company's first overseas store, replacing Linens 'n Things'.\n\nThe center of the mall previously featured a large cubed water fountain, then a merry-go-round attraction built in 1990, but it was later removed by the mall's owners, Krausz Companies, as they were losing money in its operation. An East Asian-style koi pond replaced the carousel, but was removed as of 2006. The koi were moved to Sycamore Lake at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier. The mall underwent a full interior makeover in 2007 after the removal of the koi pond.\n\nDue to the large and influential Asian immigrant populations residing and/or operating businesses in nearby areas (notably in Industry, Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights, Walnut, and Diamond Bar), some redesigns of the mall incorporated feng shui principles.\n\nToys \"R\" Us opened in June 2011, taking the spot previously occupied by Circuit City. Toys \"R\" Us had formerly been located at the Plaza at Puente Hills on Gale Avenue in Industry. It closed along with all Toys 'R' Us stores in early 2018. The store shut down on April 15, 2018.\n\nOn May 31, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 72 stores nationwide. The store closed in September 2018.\n\nOn December 1, 2019, Forever 21 announced it would close the Puente Hills Mall store along with 21 other locations in California & 90 stores nationwide. The store closed in January 2020.\n\nPuente Hills Mall served as a filming location for the fictional Twin Pines Mall (later Lone Pine Mall) in the 1985 film \"Back to the Future\". In the film, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) uses the mall's south parking lot (visible in the above photograph) to stage his time travel experiments with the DeLorean time machine. The JCPenney and Robinson's stores feature prominently in the background. A Ross Dress for Less store can be seen in a strip mall across the street. The scenes were filmed in January 1985. According to the DVD audio commentary, screenplay writer Bob Gale says that several fans gathered at the Puente Hills Mall in the early hours of October 26, 1985, the date given in the film as the present day, to see if anything would happen.\n\nPuente Hills Mall featured replicas of the Twin Pines Mall sign, the time machine, and Dr. E. Brown Enterprises truck in its parking lot in October 2015.\n\n"}

It is headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois.\n\nInterVarsity Press began as a small service branch of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship (IVCF) campus ministry, which had its U.S. beginnings in the 1939–1940 academic year. At first IVP imported books from Inter-Varsity Press in Great Britain, which despite the similar name is a different publisher, for use by college students and IVCF chapters in the United States. IVP's first home-grown publication was a Bible study guide, \"Discovering the Gospel of Mark\", written by an IVCF staff member and published under the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship name in the 1943–1944 academic year. In 1947 IVP's formal publishing program was established; since that date books have been published under the InterVarsity Press name.\n\nIn 1960 IVP's editorial offices moved from Havertown, Pennsylvania, to Chicago, where the IVCF offices were then located. In 1965 IVP published its first bestseller, \"How to Give Away Your Faith\" by Paul Little. In 1966 IVP also moved its offices from Chicago to Downers Grove, approximately 30 miles west.\n\nIn 1968 Jim Nyquist became IVP's full-time director and Jim Sire became IVP's first full-time editor. Shortly afterward, IVP began publishing Francis Schaeffer’s works, beginning with \"The God Who Is There.\" Over the course of the 1970s and 80s, many of IVP's key books were published, including \"Knowing God\" by J. I. Packer (1973), \"The Singer\" by Calvin Miller (1975), \"The Fight\" by John White (1976), \"The Universe Next Door\" by James W. Sire (1976), \"Out of the Saltshaker\" by Rebecca Manley Pippert (1979) and \"A Long Obedience in the Same Direction\" by Eugene H. Peterson (1980).\n\nIn 1984 Linda Doll became director of IVP. The next year LifeGuide Bible Studies were launched; they have now sold over 10 million copies. In 1990, Ken DeRuiter became executive director of IVP. Then in 1997, after Ken DeRuiter's retirement, Bob Fryling joined IVP as director.\n\nIVP had built a warehouse/distribution center in nearby Westmont during 1979. In January 1995, after 29 years in Downers Grove, IVP moved to new offices constructed adjacent to the distribution center. Today InterVarsity Press has a staff of nearly one hundred, publishing ninety to one hundred titles every year. IVP has more than one thousand books, Bible studies and booklets in print, shipping more than 2.3 million books each year.\n\nIn 2009 IVP won several Theologos awards.\n\n\n"}

It is the second-most widely planted species of millet, and the most grown millet species in Asia. Oldest evidence of foxtail millet is found along the ancient course of Yellow river in Cishan, China, carbon dated to be 8700 BC. Foxtail millet has also been grown in India since antiquity.\n\nOther names for the species include dwarf setaria, foxtail bristle-grass, giant setaria, green foxtail, Italian millet, German millet, and Hungarian millet.\n\nFoxtail millet is an annual grass with slim, vertical, leafy stems which can reach a height of .\n\nThe seedhead is a dense, hairy panicle long.\n\nThe small seeds, around in diameter, are encased in a thin, papery hull which is easily removed in threshing. Seed color varies greatly between varieties.\n\nNames for foxtail millet in other languages spoken in the countries where it is cultivated include:\n\nIn India, foxtail millet is still an important crop in its arid and semi-arid regions. In South India, it has been a staple diet among people for a long time from the Sangam period. It is referred to often in old Tamil texts and is commonly associated with Lord Muruga and his consort Valli.\n\nIn China, foxtail millet is the most common millet and one of the main food crops, especially among the poor in the dry northern part of that country. In Southeast Asia, foxtail millet is commonly cultivated in its dry, upland regions. In Europe and North America it is planted at a moderate scale for hay and silage, and to a more limited extent for birdseed.\n\nIn the northern Philippines, foxtail millet was once an important staple crop, until its later replacement by wet-rice and sweet potato cultivation.\n\nIt is a warm season crop, typically planted in late spring. Harvest for hay or silage can be made in 65–70 days (typical yield is 15,000–20,000 kg/ha of green matter or 3,000–4,000 kg/ha of hay), and for grain in 75–90 days (typical yield is 800–900 kg/ha of grain). Its early maturity and efficient use of available water make it suitable for raising in dry areas.\n\nDiseases of foxtail millet include leaf and head blast disease caused by \"Magnaporthe grisea\", smut disease caused by \"Ustilago crameri\", and green ear caused by \"Sclerospora graminicola\". The unharvested crop is also susceptible to attack by birds and rodents.\n\nThe wild antecedent of foxtail millet has been securely identified as \"Setaria viridis\", which is interfertile with foxtail millet; wild or weedy forms of foxtail millet also exist. Zohary and Hopf note that the primary difference between the wild and cultivated forms is \"their seed dispersal biology. Wild and weedy forms shatter their seed while the cultivars retain them.\" The reference genome for foxtail millet was completed in 2012. Genetic comparisons also confirm that \"S. viridis\" is the antecedent of \"S. italica\".\n\nThe earliest evidence of the cultivation of this grain comes from the Peiligang culture of China, which also cultivated \"Panicum miliaceum\", but foxtail millet became the predominant grain only with the Yangshao culture. More recently, the Cishan culture of China has been identified as the earliest to domesticate foxtail millet around 6500–5500 BC.\n\nThe earliest evidence for foxtail millet cultivation outside of its native distribution is at Chengtoushan in the Middle Yangtze River region, dating to around 4000 BC. In southern China, foxtail millet reached the Chengdu Plain (Baodun) at around 2700 BC and Guangxi (, near the Vietnamese border) at around 3000 BC. Foxtail millet also reached Taiwan (Nankuanli, Dapenkeng culture) at around 2800 BC and the Tibetan Plateau (Karuo) at around 3000 BC.\n\nFoxtail millet likely reached Southeast Asia via multiple routes. The earliest evidence for foxtail millet in Southeast Asia comes from various sites in the Khao Wong Prachan Valley in central Thailand, with the site at providing the earliest date with direct AMS dating to around 2300 BC.\n\nThe earliest evidence for foxtail millet in East Siberia comes from the archaeological site at Krounovka 1 in Primorsky Krai, dating to around 3620–3370 BC. The earliest direct evidence for foxtail millet in Korea come from Dongsam-dong Shell Midden, a Jeulmun site in southern Korea, with a direct AMS date of around 3,360 BC. In Japan, the earliest evidence for foxtail millet comes from the Jōmon site at Usujiri in Hokkaido, dating to around 4,000 BP.\n\nFoxtail millet arrived in Europe later; carbonized seeds first appear in the second millennium BC in central Europe. The earliest definite evidence for its cultivation in the Near East is at the Iron Age levels at Tille Hoyuk in Turkey, with an uncorrected radiocarbon date of about 600 BC.\n\n"}

{"id": "2200915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200915", "title": "Eskimo words for snow", "text": "Eskimo words for snow\n\nThe claim that Eskimo languages (specifically, Yupik and Inuit) have an unusually large number of words for \"snow\", first loosely attributed to the work of anthropologist Franz Boas and particularly promoted by his disciple Benjamin Lee Whorf, has become a cliché often used to support the controversial linguistic-relativity hypothesis (also known as \"Whorfianism\"), proposing that a language's structure, including its sound, grammar, vocabulary, etc., shapes its speakers' view of the world. This \"strong version\" of the hypothesis is largely now discredited, though the basic notion that Eskimo languages have many more root words for \"snow\" than the English language is itself supported by a single 2010 study.\n\nFranz Boas did not make quantitative claims but rather pointed out that the Eskimo–Aleut languages have about the same number of distinct word roots referring to snow as English does, but the structure of these languages tends to allow more variety as to how those roots can be modified in forming a single word. A good deal of the ongoing debate thus depends on how one defines \"word\", and perhaps even \"word root\".\n\nThe first re-evaluation of the claim was by linguist Laura Martin in 1986, who traced the history of the claim and argued that its prevalence had diverted attention from serious research into linguistic relativity. A subsequent influential and humorous, and polemical, essay by Geoff Pullum repeated Martin's critique, calling the process by which the so-called \"myth\" was created the \"Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax\". Pullum argued that the fact that the number of word roots for snow is about equally large in Eskimoan languages and English indicates that there exists no difference in the size of their respective vocabularies to define snow. Other specialists in the matter of Eskimoan languages and Eskimoan knowledge of snow and especially sea ice argue against this notion and defend Boas's original fieldwork amongst the Inuit of Baffin Island.\n\nLanguages in the Inuit and Yupik language groups add suffixes to words to express the same concepts expressed in English and many other languages by means of compound words, phrases, and even entire sentences. One can create a practically unlimited number of new words in the Eskimoan languages on any topic, not just snow, and these same concepts can be expressed in other languages using combinations of words. In general and especially in this case, it is not necessarily meaningful to compare the number of words between languages that create words in different ways due to different grammatical structures.\n\nOn the other hand, some anthropologists have argued that Boas, who lived among Baffin islanders and learnt their language, did in fact take account of the polysynthetic nature of Inuit language and included \"only words representing meaningful distinctions\" in his account.\n\nStudies of the Sami languages of Norway, Sweden and Finland, conclude that the languages have anywhere from 180 snow- and ice-related words and as many as 300 different words for types of snow, tracks in snow, and conditions of the use of snow.\n\nThe first reference to Inuit having multiple words for snow is in the introduction to \"Handbook of American Indian languages\" (1911) by linguist and anthropologist Franz Boas. He says:\n\nThe essential morphological question is why a language would say, for example, \"lake\", \"river\", and \"brook\" instead of something like \"waterplace\", \"waterfast\", and \"waterslow\". English has many snow-related words, but Boas's intent may have been to connect differences in culture with differences in language.\n\nEdward Sapir's and Benjamin Whorf's hypothesis of linguistic relativity holds that the language we speak both affects and reflects our view of the world. This idea is also reflected in the concept behind general semantics. In a popular 1940 article on the subject, Whorf referred to Eskimo languages having several words for snow: \n\nLater writers, prominently Roger Brown in his \"Words and things\" and Carol Eastman in her \"Aspects of Language and Culture\", inflated the figure in sensationalized stories: by 1978, the number quoted had reached fifty, and on February 9, 1984, an unsigned editorial in \"The New York Times\" gave the number as one hundred. However, the linguist G. Pullum shows that Inuit and other related dialects do not possess an extraordinarily large number of terms for snow.\n\nThere is no one Eskimo language. A number of cultures are referred to as Eskimo, and a number of different languages are termed Eskimo–Aleut languages. These languages may have more or fewer words for \"snow\", or perhaps more importantly, more or fewer words that are \"commonly applied\" to snow, depending on which language is considered.\n\nThree distinct word roots with the meaning \"snow\" are reconstructed for the Proto-Eskimo language *\"qaniɣ\" 'falling snow', *\"aniɣu\" 'fallen snow', and *\"apun\" 'snow on the ground'. These three stems are found in all Inuit languages and dialects—except for West Greenlandic, which lacks *\"aniɣu\". The Alaskan and Siberian Yupik people (among others) however, are not Inuit peoples, nor are their languages Inuit or Inupiaq, but all are classifiable as Eskimos, lending further ambiguity to the \"Eskimo Words for Snow\" debate.\n\n\n\n\n"}

As a teenager, he was strongly influenced by the Belgian underground scene of new wave, electro and EBM embodied by artists such as Front 242, Neon Judgement and The Klinik.\n\nHis first productions were aired on Belgium's 'Liaisons Dangereuses' radio show, and Bolland was one of the first record producers to be signed to the fledgling Belgian techno record label R&S. His first release, \"Do That Dance\" in 1989, was followed by several more under different aliases such as 'Space Opera', 'The Project', 'Cee-Jay' and 'Pulse'. Bolland's first major success with the track \"Horsepower\" on 1991s \"Ravesignal III\" EP earned him industry attention and respect with wide airplay amongst European techno DJs, and 1993s \"4th Sign\" album, including the singles \"Camargue\" and \"Nightbreed\" saw him garner further acclaim and commercial success.

The original version was directed by René Laloux, and was based on Jean-Pierre Andrevon's novel \"Les Hommes-machines contre Gandahar\" (\"The Machine-Men versus Gandahar\").\n\nThe peaceful people of Gandahar are suddenly attacked by an army of automata known as the Men of Metal, that march through the villages and kidnap their victims by turning them to stone. The resulting statues are collected and then transferred to their base. At the capital city of Jasper, the Council of Women orders Sylvain to investigate. On his journey, he encounters the Deformed, a race of mutant beings who were accidentally created via genetic experimentation by Gandahar's scientists. Despite their resentment, they are also threatened by the Men of Metal and offer to help Sylvain.\n\nSylvain later saves Airelle, a Gandaharian woman. Together they discover the Men of Metal's base, where the frozen Gandaharians are taken through a large portal and are seemingly assimilated into more Men of Metal. The two stow away on a nearby boat which heads towards the middle of the ocean where they encounter Metamorphis, a giant brain. Sylvain and Airelle are captured and confronted by Metamorphis, who tells them that although the Men of Metal believe that he is their leader, he did not create them nor order their attack. He states that he does not want to see Gandahar fall, and that he needs time to figure out the connection between him and the Men of Metal. He then returns Sylvain and Airelle to Jasper where they learn that Metamorphis, like the Deformed, was also an experiment by Gandaharian scientists. Due to his rapid growth and increasingly violent behavior, he was abandoned in the ocean. Sylvain is ordered to kill Metamorphis with a special syringe. Sylvain returns to Metamorphis, who maintains his innocence but reveals that the Men of Metal come from the future via the portal Sylvain saw earlier. He then urges Sylvain to kill him in a thousand years, as the syringe would have no effect on him now. A skeptical Sylvain agrees and Metamorphis puts him into stasis.\n\nA thousand years later, Sylvain awakens just as they had agreed. He comes across the Deformed, who explain the true nature behind the Men of Metal: Due to Metamorphis's now advanced age, his cells can no longer regenerate, which drove him to create the Men of Metal and order them to go back in time to capture the Gandaharians so he could absorb their cells to continue living, killing the Gandaharians in the process. The metal comes from Metamorphis's dead cells metallizing with time. The Deformed, however, were abandoned as they were considered undesirable. Sylvain and the Deformed then agree to work together. The Deformed fight off the Men of Metal and rescue the remaining Gandaharians while Sylvain goes to face Metamorphis alone. The Deformed destroy the reservoir supplying Metamorphis with new cells, distracting him long enough to let Sylvain inject the syringe into Metamorphis which kills him. Sylvain, along with the Deformed and the Gandaharians escape through the portal back to their time.\n\n\n\nThe animation was in colour and ran for 83 minutes. Production work was done by SEK Animation Studio of North Korea. The film is notable for its strange scenery and exotic flora, fauna, and bizarre inhabitants. The design was by the French comic book artist Caza.\n\nThis version was directed by Harvey Weinstein and produced by Bob Weinstein through Miramax Films itself, while noted science-fiction author Isaac Asimov made the revision of the translation. The English title is a translation, not of the original title, but of the original tag line \"Les Années lumière\" (The Light Years) as seen on the French poster.\n\n\nA European DVD release of \"Gandahar\", in French with English subtitles, was released in October 2007 by Eureka!'s Masters of Cinema label.

Uranium-233 was investigated for use in nuclear weapons and as a reactor fuel. It has been used successfully in experimental nuclear reactors and has been proposed for much wider use as a nuclear fuel. It has a half-life of 160,000 years.\n\nUranium-233 is produced by the neutron irradiation of thorium-232. When thorium-232 absorbs a neutron, it becomes thorium-233, which has a half-life of only 22 minutes. Thorium-233 decays into protactinium-233 through beta decay. Protactinium-233 has a half-life of 27 days and beta decays into uranium-233; some proposed molten salt reactor designs attempt to physically isolate the protactinium from further neutron capture before beta decay can occur, to maintain the neutron economy (if it misses the U window, the next fissile target is U, meaning a total of 4 neutrons needed to trigger fission).\n\nU usually fissions on neutron absorption, but sometimes retains the neutron, becoming uranium-234. The capture-to-fission ratio of uranium-233 is smaller than those of the other two major fissile fuels, uranium-235 and plutonium-239.\n\nIn 1946, the public first became informed of uranium-233 bred from thorium as \"a third available source of nuclear energy and atom bombs\" (in addition to uranium-235 and plutonium-239), following a United Nations report and a speech by Glenn T. Seaborg.\n\nThe United States produced, over the course of the Cold War, approximately 2 metric tons of uranium-233, in varying levels of chemical and isotopic purity. These were produced at the Hanford Site and Savannah River Site in reactors that were designed for the production of plutonium-239.\n\nUranium-233 has been used as a fuel in several different reactor types, and is proposed as a fuel for several new designs (see thorium fuel cycle), all of which breed it from thorium. Uranium-233 can be bred in either fast reactors or thermal reactors, unlike the uranium-238-based fuel cycles which require the superior neutron economy of a fast reactor in order to breed plutonium, that is, to produce more fissile material than is consumed.\n\nThe long-term strategy of the nuclear power program of India, which has substantial thorium reserves, is to move to a nuclear program breeding uranium-233 from thorium feedstock.\n\nThe fission of one atom of uranium-233 generates 197.9 MeV = 3.171·10 J  (i.e. 19.09 TJ/mol = 81.95 TJ/kg).\n\nAs a potential weapon material, pure uranium-233 is more similar to plutonium-239 than uranium-235 in terms of source (bred vs natural), half-life and critical mass (both 4–5 kg in beryllium-reflected sphere).\n\nIn 1994, the US government declassified a 1966 memo that states that uranium-233 has been shown to be highly satisfactory as a weapons material, though it is only superior to plutonium in rare circumstances. It was claimed that if the existing weapons were based on uranium-233 instead of plutonium-239, Livermore would not be interested in switching to plutonium.\n\nThe co-presence of uranium-232 can complicate the manufacture and use of uranium-233, though the Livermore memo indicates a likelihood that this complication can be worked around.\n\nWhile it is thus possible to use uranium-233 as the fissile material of a nuclear weapon, speculation aside, there is scant publicly available information on this isotope actually having been weaponized:\n\nThe B Reactor and others at the Hanford Site optimized for the production of weapons-grade material have been used to manufacture U.\n\nOverall the United States is thought to have produced two tons of U, of various levels of purity, some with U impurity content as low as 6 ppm.\n\nProduction of U (through the irradiation of thorium-232) invariably produces small amounts of uranium-232 as an impurity, because of parasitic (n,2n) reactions on uranium-233 itself, or on protactinium-233, or on thorium-232:\n\nAnother channel involves neutron capture reaction on small amounts of thorium-230, which is a tiny fraction of natural thorium present due to the decay of uranium-238:\n\nThe decay chain of U quickly yields strong gamma radiation emitters. Thallium-208 is the strongest of these, at 2.6 MeV:\nThis makes manual handling in a glove box with only light shielding (as commonly done with plutonium) too hazardous, (except possibly in a short period immediately following chemical separation of the uranium from its decay products) and instead requiring complex remote manipulation for fuel fabrication.\n\nThe hazards are significant even at 5 parts per million. Implosion nuclear weapons require U levels below 50 ppm (above which the U is considered \"low grade\"; cf. \"Standard weapon grade plutonium requires a Pu content of no more than 6.5%.\" which is 65000 ppm, and the analogous Pu was produced in levels of 0.5% (5000 ppm) or less). Gun-type fission weapons additionally need low levels (1 ppm range) of light impurities, to keep the neutron generation low.\n\nThe production of \"clean\" U, low in U, requires a few factors: 1) obtaining a relatively pure Th source, low in Th (which also transmutes to U), 2) moderating the incident neutrons to have an energy not higher that 6 MeV (too-high energy neutrons cause the Th (n,2n) → Th reaction) and 3) removing the thorium sample from neutron flux before the U concentration builds up to a too high level, in order to avoid fissioning the U itself (which would produce energetic neutrons).\n\nThe Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) used U, bred in light water reactors such as Indian Point Energy Center, that was about 220 ppm U.\n\nThorium, from which U is bred, is roughly three to four times more abundant in the earth's crust than uranium.\nThe decay chain of U itself is part of the neptunium series, the decay chain of its grandparent Np.\n\nUses for uranium-233 include the production of the medical isotopes actinium-225 and bismuth-213 which are among its daughters, low-mass nuclear reactors for space travel applications, use as an isotopic tracer, nuclear weapons research, and reactor fuel research including the thorium fuel cycle.\n\nThe radioisotope bismuth-213 is a decay product of uranium-233; it has promise for the treatment of certain types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia and cancers of the pancreas, kidneys and other organs.\n\n"}
{"id": "2200954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200954", "title": "Magnetic force microscope", "text": "Magnetic force microscope\n\nMagnetic force microscopy (MFM) is a variety of atomic force microscopy, in which a sharp magnetized tip scans a magnetic sample; the tip-sample magnetic interactions are detected and used to reconstruct the magnetic structure of the sample surface. Many kinds of magnetic interactions are measured by MFM, including magnetic dipole–dipole interaction. MFM scanning often uses non-contact AFM (NC-AFM) mode.\n\nIn MFM measurements, the magnetic force between the sample and the tip can be expressed as \n\nwhere formula_2 is the magnetic moment of the tip (approximated as a point dipole), formula_3 is the magnetic stray field from the sample surface, and \"µ\" is the magnetic permeability of free space.\n\nBecause the stray magnetic field from the sample can affect the magnetic state of the tip, and vice versa, interpretation of the MFM measurement is not straightforward. For instance, the geometry of the tip magnetization must be known for quantitative analysis.\n\nTypical resolution of 30 nm can be achieved, although resolutions as low as 10 to 20 nm are attainable.\n\nA boost in the interest to MFM resulted from the following inventions:\n\nScanning tunneling microscope (STM) 1982, Tunneling current between the tip and sample is used as the signal. Both the tip and sample must be electrically conductive.\n\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) 1986, forces (atomic/electrostatic) between the tip and sample are sensed from the deflections of a flexible lever (cantilever). The cantilever tip flies above the sample with a typical distance of tens of nanometers.\n\nMagnetic Force Microscopy (MFM), 1987 Derives from AFM. The magnetic forces between the tip and sample are sensed. Image of the magnetic stray field is obtained by scanning the magnetized tip over the sample surface in a raster scan.\n\nThe main components of an MFM system are:\n\nOften, MFM is operated with the so-called \"lift height\" method. When the tip scans the surface of a sample at close distances (< 10 nm), not only magnetic forces are sensed, but also atomic and electrostatic forces. The lift height method helps to enhance the magnetic contrast through the following:\n\nThe stray field from the sample exerts a force on the magnetic tip. The force is detected by measuring the displacement of the cantilever by reflecting a laser beam from it. The cantilever end is either deflected away or towards the sample surface by a distance Δ\"z\" = \"F\"/\"k\" (perpendicular to the surface).\n\n\"Static mode\" corresponds to measurements of the cantilever deflection. Forces in the range of tens of piconewtons are normally measured.\n\nFor small deflections, the tip-cantilever can be modeled as a damped harmonic oscillator with an effective mass (\"m\") in [kg], an ideal spring constant (\"k\") in [N/m], and a damper (\"D\") in [N·s/m].\n\nIf an external oscillating force \"F\" is applied to the cantilever, then the tip will be displaced by an amount \"z\". Moreover, the displacement will also harmonically oscillate, but with a phase shift between applied force and displacement given by:\nwhere the amplitude and phase shifts are given by:\n\nHere the quality factor of resonance, resonance angular frequency, and damping factor are:\n\nDynamic mode of operation refers to measurements of the shifts in the resonance frequency.\nThe cantilever is driven to its resonance frequency and frequency shifts are detected.\nAssuming small vibration amplitudes (which is generally true in MFM measurements), to a first-order approximation, the resonance frequency can be related to the natural frequency and the force gradient. That is, the shift in the resonance frequency is a result of changes in the spring constant due to the (repelling and attraction) forces acting on the tip.\n\nThe change in the natural resonance frequency is given by\n\nFor instance, the coordinate system is such that positive \"z\" is away from or perpendicular to the sample surface, so that an attractive force would be in the negative direction (\"F\"<0), and thus the gradient is positive. Consequently, for attractive forces, the resonance frequency of the cantilever decreases (as described by the equation). The image is encoded in such a way that attractive forces are generally depicted in black color, while repelling forces are coded white.\n\nTheoretically, the magneto-static energy (\"U\") of the tip-sample system can be calculated in one of two ways:\nOne can either compute the magnetization (\"M\") of the tip in the presence of an applied magnetic field (formula_10) of the sample or compute the magnetization (formula_11) of the sample in the presence of the applied magnetic field of the tip (whichever is easier).\nThen, integrate the (dot) product of the magnetization and stray field over the interaction volume (formula_12) as\n\nand compute the gradient of the energy over distance to obtain the force \"F\". Assuming that the cantilever deflects along the \"z\"-axis, and the tip is magnetized along a certain direction (e.g. the \"z\"-axis), then the equations can be simplified to\n\nSince the tip is magnetized along a specific direction, it will be sensitive to the component of the magnetic stray field of the sample which is aligned to the same direction. \n\nThe MFM can be used to image various magnetic structures including domain walls (Bloch and Neel), closure domains, recorded magnetic bits, etc. Furthermore, motion of domain wall can also be studied in an external magnetic field. MFM images of various materials can be seen in the following books and journal publications: thin films, nanoparticles, nanowires, permalloy disks and recording media.\n\nThe popularity of MFM originates from several reasons, which include:\n\nThere are some shortcomings or difficulties when working with an MFM, such as: the recorded image depends on the type of the tip and magnetic coating, due to tip-sample interactions. Magnetic field of the tip and sample can change each other's magnetization, \"M\", which can result in nonlinear interactions. This hinders image interpretation. Relatively short lateral scanning range (order of hundreds micrometers). Scanning (lift) height affects the image. Housing of the MFM system is important to shield electromagnetic noise (Faraday cage), acoustic noise (anti-vibration tables), air flow (air isolation), and static charge on the sample.\n\nThere have been several attempts to overcome the limitations mentioned above and to improve the resolution limits of MFM. For example, the limitations from air flow has been overcome by MFMs that operate at vacuum. The tip-sample effects have been understood and solved by several approaches. Wu et al., have used a tip with antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic layers in an attempt to produce a dipole only at the apex.\n\n"}

It was established in 2003 and sought to start a long-haul, low-fares operation using two dry-leased Boeing 747-400 aircraft. Proposed destinations included Delhi, Bangkok, Munich and Manchester. The company shut down in 2005 before conducting any flights.\n\nIn June 2003, BackpackersXpress sought A$80 million with the goal to begin operations in November 2003. However, investors were reluctant to provide funding due to concerns over the impact on the aviation industry of the Iraq War and Severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. The project proponents told the \"Australian Financial Review\" in December that year that they had been able to demonstrate that the market for backpacker tourism was less affected by these events, and that they intended to apply for an air operator's certificate in January 2004.\n\nBackpackersXpress hoped to attract backpackers by offering relatively low fares, fitting the Boeing 747s with a pub, and providing live entertainment to passengers. The aircrew would encourage passengers to socialise, and Indigenous Australians would provide information on their culture. It was also planned to conduct karaoke and dance competitions during the flights. The Boeing 747s were to be fitted with 473 seats, which was 100 more than typical. The aircraft would also carry up to 20 tonnes of freight per flight.\n\nIn December 2003 it was reported that there was an in-principle agreement for Carlton & United Breweries to be the airline's \"official brewer\", and \"Neighbours\" actor Ryan Moloney would appear in its advertising. At this time the company claimed it would attract 139,000 passengers during its initial year of operations.\n\nBackpackersXpress had 14 staff members in May 2004, and was holding talks with Singapore Airlines about leasing aircraft and an unnamed British airline concerning funding for the venture. The company claimed that it would employ 400 people once flights commenced. At this time it was still not able to operate flights as it did not have an air operator's certificate. An industry expert interviewed by Bloomberg News was sceptical that the venture was viable given that the proponents did not have a track record in the aviation industry and the market for long-haul flights was highly competitive. In February 2004 a writer in \"The Times\" stated that \"It seems doubtful to any sane observer ... whether the project will ever get off the ground\", and that the plan to encourage a \"party in the sky\" was \"a radical move\" given the concerns over air rage and terrorism.\n\nOn 30 July 2004 the International Air Services Commission (IASC) rejected an application from BackpackersXpress for permission to fly up to three flights per week between Australia and the United Kingdom as the company had not demonstrated that it would be able to operate the services, and awarded the right to conduct these flights to Qantas. An earlier application to operate between Australia and India had also been rejected on the same grounds. The IASC noted in its determination that this judgement meant that there would not be any unallocated capacity for BackpackersXpress to operate between Australia and the two countries in the foreseeable future, even if it was able to further develop its business model and gain necessary regulatory approvals. At this time BackpackersXpress had not been able to reach an agreement to lease aircraft.\n\nIn August 2004 BackpackersXpress was planning to start an accommodation and touring company to generate cash flow and raise the firm's profile before commencing flights. By September it had dropped its plan to fly from Melbourne, and was considering using Darwin or Cairns as its base. In November that year the \"Australian Financial Review\" reported that BackpackersXpress was \"redoing the numbers\" that underpinned its business plan after its application for flights to the UK was rejected.\n\nSeed funding for the BackpackersXpress was withdrawn on 20 January 2005, and the company closed in April that year. During its existence BackpackersXpress' total expenditure was $A1 million. Two of the company's creditors were conducting legal action to reclaim debts in April 2005.\n\nA 2006 story in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" stated that the failure of BackpackersXpress suggested that two other proposals to launch long-haul discount airlines at the time were unlikely to be successful.\n"}
{"id": "2200971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200971", "title": "WBQT (FM)", "text": "WBQT (FM)\n\nWBQT (96.9 MHz \"Hot 96.9\") is a commercial FM radio station in Boston, Massachusetts. It is owned by the Beasley Broadcast Group and airs an urban-leaning rhythmic hot AC radio format. WBQT's studios and offices are located on Morrissey Boulevard in Dorchester. Its transmitter is atop the Prudential Tower in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood.\n\nThe station originated in 1945 as W1XHR (later WXHR), owned by Harvey Radio Laboratories and programming a classical music format. In 1966, WXHR was sold to a joint venture of Kaiser Broadcasting and the \"Boston Globe\", and in 1967, became beautiful music station WJIB (whose AM successor operates out of the old Harvey Radio Labs building in Cambridge). After several further ownership changes—first to General Electric in 1972, then to NBC in 1983 (three years before the merger between NBC's parent company, RCA, and GE) and Emmis Communications in 1988—it flipped to smooth jazz as WCDJ, \"CD96.9\", on October 26, 1990. The first song under the new format was \"Breakout\" by Swing Out Sister. After Greater Media bought the station in May 1993, the station began stunting with a simulcast of new sister station WMJX at 1:00 p.m. on May 4 of that year. Two days later, at 4:00 p.m., WCDJ flipped to country as WBCS, \"Country 96.9.\" The first song was \"Here We Are\" by Alabama. The station became WKLB-FM on August 24, 1996, after the previous WKLB-FM was bought by Greater Media and consolidated with WBCS, with its frequency being converted to WROR-FM. Smooth jazz returned at Noon on August 22, 1997 as WSJZ, after a format swap with what had been WOAZ (now WCRB). On September 7, 1999, it flipped to talk, completing a one-month transition to the format. Shortly after the flip, the station changed its call letters to WTKK. During its tenure as a talk station, WTKK used several monikers: \"96.9 FM Talk\" from its 1999 launch until 2007, \"96.9 WTKK: Boston's Talk Evolution\" from 2007 until 2010, \"96.9 Boston Talks\" from 2010 until September 2012, and \"News Talk 96.9\" from September 2012 until its January 2013 demise.\n\nIn April 2007, WTKK management attempted to add \"Boston Herald\" columnist and talk-show host Howie Carr to its lineup, when the station's syndicated morning show \"Imus in the Morning\" was cancelled after Don Imus' comments about the Rutgers University Women's Basketball team got him fired by CBS Radio. But Carr's long-time radio employer and WTKK's chief rival, Entercom-owned WRKO, blocked that move by exercising a clause in Carr's contract allowing it to make a matching counter-offer. Carr held out until November 16, 2007, after which point Carr returned to WRKO. On December 3, 2007, WTKK resumed broadcasting Imus in the Morning when it was picked up by WABC in New York City and syndicated by Westwood One. But over time, Imus' hours were cut back on WTKK, ultimately only airing for 2 hours every weekday morning. In January 2011, WTKK dropped Imus from the lineup completely in favor of an extended edition of the local late morning team of Jim Braude and Margery Eagan.\n\nWTKK fired the controversial Jay Severin, a host since 1999, in April 2011 after he said he had slept with female interns at a company he had owned, and defended the practice. He was officially replaced in June 2011 by radio host Doug Meehan. Two months later, when rival station WXKS hired Severin for afternoon drive, WTKK shuffled its lineup to place politics-heavy Michael Graham in the 3:00 p.m. slot. The lineup at this point included Eagan and Braude, followed by various hosts in late mornings, then syndicated talker Michael Smerconish, followed by \"The Daily Wrap\", hosted by Michael Castner and syndicated by the Wall Street Journal Radio Network, then the syndicated John Batchelor and Overnight America shows.\n\nIn December 2012, Greater Media registered several web domains for WTKK, pointing that the future of the news/talk format was in serious doubt due to low ratings (in its last book as a talk station, WTKK had a 1.9 share of the market in the Boston Arbitron radio market ratings). Many of the domains included the word \"Beat\", pointing to an urban contemporary, rhythmic CHR, or rhythmic AC format. If this were to occur, this would have marked a return for either the Rhythmic AC format (which was last heard in 2005, when WQSX flipped to adult hits) or the urban format (which was last carried on a Boston station in 2006, when the former WILD-FM flipped to a simulcast of WAAF) in the market; in either case, this would have caused the station to compete against long-dominant WJMN. Other domains pointed to possible adult hits, oldies, all-news, sports talk, active rock, dance music, adult contemporary, classic rock, mainstream rock, alternative rock, adult album alternative, or CHR formats. Further fueling the rumors of a format flip, on December 17, 2012, morning host Doug Meehan left to pursue a television opportunity in Arizona, while afternoon host Michael Graham left when his contract was not renewed. In addition, weekend hosts were told the last weekend of 2012 that their shows would not continue in the new year.\nIn compliance with a press release by Greater Media on January 1, 2013, the station flipped at 10:00 a.m. on January 2, 2013 after Jim Braude and Margery Eagan's morning show, starting its new incarnation as Urban Contemporary-formatted \"Power 96.9\", which began with \"Diamonds\" by Rihanna. However, this would only turn out to be a stunt in a series of \"micro-formats\"; at 10:00 a.m. the following day, the station shifted to Dance as \"Nova 96.9.\" At Noon on January 4th, the stunting shifted to adult hits, branded as \"96.9 Mike FM\" (using the former moniker/format of WMKK). At Midnight on January 6th, the stunting would shift to classic rock as \"96.9 The Bone.\"\n\nOn January 8, 2013, at 11:00 a.m., WTKK debuted its new, permanent format: Rhythmic AC, with the branding \"Hot 96.9\"; \"Run This Town\" by Jay-Z was the first song played. According to a press release from Greater Media, the station's direction will primarily be focused on current Rhythmic and Dance hits mixed in with recurrents from the 1980s and 1990s, as it targets an audience who grew up listening to WJMN in the 1990s and 2000s, but want an alternative to Adult Top 40 WBMX, whose presentation is more Pop/Rock oriented. The flip brings the format back to Boston for the first time since WQSX flipped to WMKK in 2005. In addition, like WQSX, WTKK is also using \"The New Rhythm of Boston\" as its on-air slogan (albeit briefly; the station adopted its \"Today's Rhythm & All the Best Throwbacks\" slogan a month later, which was modified to \"Today's Hottest New Music...\" in July 2014, and then \"#1 For Throwbacks and Today's Best Hip Hop and R&B\" in June 2016). On March 20, 2013, WTKK changed its call sign to WBQT. Clear Channel soon obtained the former call sign for use on their current 106.1 FM facility in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nIn terms of staff announcements, Greater Media confirmed on January 3, 2013, that Pebbles, former long-time morning co-host on WJMN, will be WTKK's new morning show host. Also brought on from WJMN was Melissa, who became the afternoon drive time host from 2:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. In addition, on January 4, 2013, Greater Media announced that Jackson \"Cadillac Jack\" McCartney has been hired as Director of Programming for all 5 stations in their Boston cluster. On February 20, 2013, it was announced that former WJMN DJ Roy Barboza was named Music Director and Mix Show Coordinator. On March 1, 2013, it was announced that Baltazar, who co-hosted WJMN's morning show with Pebbles from 1995-2001, would become the new co-host of Hot 96.9's morning show beginning on March 4, 2013, reuniting him with Pebbles. In August 2013, former WJMN personalities Deirdre Dagata and Hustle Simmons became weekend hosts at the station. On January 8, 2014, former WXKS personality Jackson Blue became WBQT's new afternoon host, with Melissa moving to middays. In April 2014, former WJMN personality Bobby Blaze briefly became a Sunday afternoon/evening host (he would be replaced by Reggie Beas). On August 18, 2014, Baltazar was released from the station, and was replaced by former New England Patriots player and WBZ-FM host Jermaine Wiggins. In addition, Melissa moved to morning drive, with Dagata replacing her in middays. On January 7, 2016, WBQT announced that Ramiro, former morning show host at WJMN from 2001 until he was let go in July 2015 (as well as the host of the Rhythmic edition of the syndicated Weekend Top 30), will host mornings with Wiggins, Pebbles and Melissa beginning January 14, 2016.\n\nWith the station having moved further to Rhythmic Top 40, and in effect on par with WJMN, Mediabase has moved the station to the Rhythmic panel in January 2015.\n\nOn July 19, 2016, Beasley Media Group announced it would acquire Greater Media and its 21 stations (including WBQT) for $240 million. The FCC approved the sale on October 6, 2016, and the sale closed on November 1, 2016.\n\nWBQT-HD2 programs an all-Irish music format as \"96.9 Irish\", due in part to Boston's Irish history and influence. The HD2 subchannel has been on-air since 2006, when it debuted as \"Classical 2.0.\" In late 2006, when Greater Media purchased classical station WCRB, 96.9-2 flipped to an all-Irish format. From early May to July 4, 2017, sister station WRCA simulcasted \"96.9 Irish\", while the station changed its branding to \"Boston's Irish Channel\". The station currently airs primarily Bloomberg News programming, with local news cut into the national programming of Bloomberg.\n\nIn October 2019, WBQT-HD2 flipped to a current-heavy urban contemporary format as \"96.9 the Vibe\".\n\n"}

He claimed that a simple screen and padlock over a broken window would have dissuaded him, and that he was only capable of the bombing because strike-breakers had been \"dehumanized\" by his union.

{"id": "2200993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200993", "title": "For Keeps (film)", "text": "For Keeps (film)\n\nFor Keeps is a 1988 American coming of age comedy drama film starring Molly Ringwald and Randall Batinkoff as Darcy and Stan, two high school seniors in love. Complications ensue when Darcy becomes pregnant just before graduation and decides to keep her baby. This movie is noted for being Ringwald's final \"teen\" movie, and is cited as one of her most mature performances, particularly in a scene where Darcy is suffering from postpartum depression after the birth of her child.\n\nIn Kenosha, Wisconsin, Darcy, editor at her high school paper, and her steady boyfriend Stan are in their final year of high school and already have been accepted at good colleges; before Darcy goes to the University of Wisconsin to study journalism, she will go on a trip to Paris with her mother for her graduation present, while Stan will go to Caltech to study architecture. With the help of Darcy's best friend Lila, Darcy and Stan spend a weekend together, where they sleep together, and Darcy becomes pregnant. They announce the news at Thanksgiving, and neither Darcy's mother Donna, who was abandoned by her husband and brought up Darcy alone, nor Stan's Catholic parents are very supportive. Respectively, they urge the young couple to have an abortion or give up the baby for adoption. Darcy plans to have an abortion, but does not go through with it, much to Stan's relief.\n\nAt Christmas, the kids announce their plans to keep the baby, causing a break between them and their parents. They rent a decrepit apartment and marry to the cheers of their friends, despite the fact that without parental consent the marriage is not legal. At the urging of her high school guidance counselor, who explains that other girls will want to emulate her and become adolescent mothers themselves, Darcy drops out of high school but works toward her GED. Prom is interrupted by Darcy's water breaking; although baby Thea (short for Theodosia) is healthy, Darcy suffers from post-partum depression, unable to even hold her daughter, and Stan struggles to pay the bills on a part-time job salary. Only when Darcy hears an intruder (who turns out to be Stan's father) and picks up her baby protectively does she break from her depression.\n\nWithout telling Darcy, Stan sacrifices his Caltech scholarship because there is no married housing at the school for undergraduates. Stan and Darcy’s relationship starts to crumble with fights and Stan drinking and being unreceptive to Darcy’s attempt to plan. Although Stan takes a second, dead-end job, the bills pile up, and the couple finally moves in with Donna, which alienates Stan and Darcy, and causes Stan to continue drinking heavily. Local neighborhood girl Michaela informs Darcy of the scholarship deception so she enlists Stan's best friend Chris in a plan to ensure he take the scholarship and go to college after all. The plan entails throwing out Stan and annulling the marriage. Stan has a bad reaction to the news and later in the night has a rage outside their house causing the police to be called. Stan reconciles with his parents, but is heartbroken over the split with Darcy, who does not change her mind but becomes visibly angrily at her mother's cold attitude.\n\nAt Darcy's night school graduation, Stan arrives to inform Darcy that he has applied for scholarships to the University of Wisconsin–Madison for them both. Darcy lets slip her role in the Caltech deception with Chris, and Stan chases after her as she drives away. Darcy finally tells Donna that Stan is a good man, that she loves him and Donna can either embrace them as an entire family or watch them live their lives without her. Donna finally gets over her past and says she loves and supports Darcy fully. They reconcile, go forward on their plans to attend college in Madison in the fall, and remark Thea will have a very early curfew when she is a teenager. Stan says ten p.m. and Darcy says eleven p.m. Then they say if she is really in love her curfew will be eight p.m.\n\n\nThe film is set in Kenosha, Wisconsin and was partially filmed there. Primary location work took place in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\n\nThe film had a number of titles while in production, possibilities including \"Maybe, Baby\" (by which it is known in some overseas territories) and \"For Keeps?\", before settling on the final question mark-less version.\n\nJohn Zarchen suffered a life-threatening head injury while driving in Hollywood. He survived a brief period of being comatose, and actually returned to the film, although director John Avildsen, due to his medical absence and disgusted with the actor's disregard for the opportunity and the production, greatly cut down his role. This movie also marks the film debut of Pauly Shore, who appears in a small role as another friend of Stan.\n\nThe musical score features a lullaby-like version of the song \"Be My Baby\", sung by composer Ellie Greenwich.\n\nActor Adam Silbar was originally cast in the lead role of Stan but, for unknown reasons, the role was later re-cast with Randall Batinkoff just weeks before the first day of production. Author and casting director Paul G. Bens, Jr., then an actor, was one of the two finalists to replace Silbar. The role ultimately went to Batinkoff.\n\nRotten Tomatoes aggregate score gave the film an 18% rotten rating based on 11 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review saying, \"The movies of Molly Ringwald have been responsible for a revolution in the way Hollywood regards teenagers. Before Ringwald (and her mentor, John Hughes) there were only horny teenagers, dead teenagers, teenage vampires and psychotic crackups. Now teenage movies are working their way through some of the aspects of the normal life of American teenagers, and in 'For Keeps,' Ringwald plays a popular high school senior who gets pregnant and gets married.\"\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" said, \"Most of \"For Keeps\" is entirely predictable, but that should do little to diminish its interest for audiences of high-school age. Here again, Miss Ringwald is the very model of teen-age verisimilitude, and she's most impressive in making even the most hackneyed situations seem real. In fact, she's so good she's almost a problem. Mr. Batinkoff, while pleasant, is no real match for her, and the glowering parents who make their kids' lives miserable for a time are no real threat. There is the feeling that Miss Ringwald's Darcy can triumph over anything. But perhaps that's just what Mr. Avildsen had in mind.\"\n\nJudge Brian Pope gave a positive review saying, \"Pretty but approachable, smart but funny, cool but sweet, Ringwald represented everything most high-school girls wanted to be: the girl next door who always got the guy without compromising her values. Small wonder she is still regarded as an icon of 1980s teen cinema. It wasn't until Ringwald began dipping her toes into slightly more adult roles that she lost her footing. Take 'For Keeps', for instance. This movie dared to suggest that even a popular honors student is capable of making wrong decisions that result in life-changing consequences. More crucially, Ringwald suggested to her fans that the qualities they found so endearing in her aren't always adequate substitutes for natural maturity. Perhaps that was a bitter pill for her fans to swallow, but it's not such a bad message, and, more than 15 years after its release, 'For Keeps' isn't such a bad movie.\"\n\nDavid Nusair gave a more negative review saying, \"For Keeps takes a potentially intriguing subject (two teenagers attempting to start their lives together) and piles on cliche after cliche, until it's about as compelling as an afterschool special.\"\n\nIn January 1988, the film debuted at #4 at the box office (behind \"Good Morning, Vietnam\", \"Three Men and a Baby\", and \"Moonstruck\"). Grossing $17,514,553 domestically, the film is a box office success given its estimated budget of $10 million.\n\nOn March 23, 2004 the film was released on DVD.\n\n"}

It is at the intersection of Interstate 820 and U.S. Business Highway 287 in northwest Fort Worth, near downtown. It has two parallel runways; the old runway 9-27 is now closed permanently. The airport is named after former Fort Worth Mayor Henry C. Meacham. The airport covers 745 acres (301 ha).\n\nMeacham Airport was purchased by the city of Fort Worth on July 3, 1925, named Fort Worth Municipal Airport. In 1927 the airport was renamed Meacham Field after former Fort Worth Mayor Henry C. Meacham.\n\nMeacham was Fort Worth's airline airport until April 1953 when major carriers moved to Amon Carter Field (later Greater Southwest International Airport). The January 1953 OAG shows 50 weekday airline departures from Meacham, 33 of which headed for Dallas. None of the others flew nonstop north of Wichita Falls, west of Midland, south of Austin or east of Dallas.\n\nSince 1953 Meacham Airport has been used for corporate aircraft, commuter flights, and student pilot training. It was renamed in 1985 to Fort Worth Meacham Airport and in 1995 to Fort Worth Meacham International Airport. Since 1953 seven airlines have tried scheduled passenger flights from Meacham; none lasted more than a couple of years.\n\n\nIn April 2006 low-cost carrier Skybus Airlines expressed interest in operating out of the airfield as it started operations in 2007, but it folded before the repeal of the Wright Amendment in 2014.\n\nIn 2018, city officials and company founder David Neeleman hinted that a proposed low-cost carrier, tentatively named Moxy, may operate from Meacham starting in 2020. City aviation director Bill Welstead denied holding discussions with Moxy but confirmed that Frontier Airlines and Allegiant Air were interested in serving the airport. Although the city has recently spent millions of dollars on several projects to improve airport facilities for general aviation, Welstead claimed that the city was not actively planning to build adequate terminal parking for passengers, which he said would be necessary before commercial airline service could begin.\n\nSeveral companies operate aircraft services at the airport, including a division of the U.S. defense contractor Alliant Techsystems (ATK) and Texas Aviation Services . An aviation museum (open weekends and by appointment during the week) is located in Hangar 33S on the airport's south side, at the end of Ellis Street. The terminal building houses several ATK employees, some Fort Worth city departments (mainly Aviation and Housing Development), a branch of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, and several aviation related businesses. The Civil Air Patrol operates two squadrons at Meacham, the Fort Worth Senior Squadron, and the Phoenix Composite Squadron. There are three FBOs operating on the field: American Aero, Cornerstone Flight Center and Texas Jet.\n\nAt one time Fort Worth Airlines had its headquarters at the airport.\n\n\n"}

As a freshman in 2002, Sanders was a first-team freshman All-American selection by the Football Writers Association of America and an All-WAC honorable mention. He started every game at strong safety for the second straight year in his 2003 sophomore season, earning first-team All-WAC honors. In his junior season in 2004, Sanders again earned All-WAC honors in what would prove to be his final season at Fresno State.\n\nSanders was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft (133rd overall). He was subsequently signed by the Patriots in July 2005. He played in 10 games as a rookie in 2005, starting twice. In a Week 14 game against the Buffalo Bills, Sanders returned an interception late in the game 39 yards for a touchdown. Sanders started five of the 16 games he played in during the 2006 season, filling in for an injured Rodney Harrison.\n\nDuring the 2007 season, fellow safety Eugene Wilson lost his starting spot to Sanders, who went on to start 15 games in the regular season and Super Bowl XLII. He started 14 games in 2008, missing two games in December due to an injury. In March 2009, Sanders agreed to terms with the Patriots on a three-year contract. It was reported that Sanders turned down more money elsewhere to return to the Patriots.\n\nDuring an August 2, 2009 press conference, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick spoke of Sanders:\nSanders started the first game of the 2009 season before losing his job to Brandon McGowan in Week 2. He suffered a shoulder injury in Week 4 and missed the team's Week 5 game. He regained his starting job in Week 14, and started the final four games of the season as well as the Patriots' playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens. He finished the season with 48 tackles.\n\nIn 2010, Sanders opened the regular season as a starter in the Patriots' base defense following the demotion of Brandon Meriweather, and started two of the first three games. After Meriweather returned as a starter in Week 4, Sanders was the team's third safety until he filled in for an injured Patrick Chung in Weeks 8 and 9. In Week 10, Sanders did not start but was named AFC Defensive Player of the Week after intercepting a Ben Roethlisberger pass and returning it 32 yards for a touchdown in a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the next game against the Indianapolis Colts, Sanders made a game-saving interception at the Patriots' 6-yard line with seconds remaining when he picked off quarterback Peyton Manning's throw as the Colts offense (already in field goal range) was poised to score and either tie the game or take the lead with a touchdown.\n\nSanders finished the 2010 season with 58 tackles, three interceptions, and one forced fumble in 15 games played (nine starts). He was released by New England on August 29, 2011.\n\nOn August 30, 2011, Sanders signed with the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nSanders signed with the Arizona Cardinals on April 4, 2012.\n\n"}

He is also known for his heavy use of the musical saw in recordings, even releasing \"The Singing Saw at Christmastime\", his only solo album released under his own name, in 2008.\n\nIn 1989, Koster formed Miss America with Liza Wakeman, Alan Edwards, Paul Wells and Keith Block. After legal threats from Miss America, they became Chocolate USA. Chocolate USA released two albums on Bar/None before disbanding to follow other projects.\n\nKoster joined Jeff Mangum, Scott Spillane and Jeremy Barnes to record the second Neutral Milk Hotel album, \"In the Aeroplane over the Sea\", on which he played bass, banjo and singing saw. The success of the album, however, took its toll on Mangum, and the band went on hiatus shortly after its release.

This was followed by a caroling tour, on which he played songs from \"The Singing Saw at Christmastime\" and selected tracks from \"Music Tapes for Clouds and Tornadoes\" for free wherever fans invited him to play. This evolved into an annual caroling tradition, which transformed into the \"Lullabies at Bedsides\" house tour of 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 which in turn gave way to the long-planned Traveling Imaginary of 2012–2013.

Haeundae is one of the wealthiest districts in South Korea, and has been subject to considerable commercial development in recent decades, including the Marine City and Centum City areas with their distinctive skyscrapers and high rise buildings.\n\nHaeundae is linked to Busan Subway Line 2 and train stations on the Donghae Nambu railway line.\n\nHaeundae takes its name from the ninth century Silla scholar and poet Choi Chi-won (literary name Haeun, or \"Sea and Clouds\"), who, according to a historical account, admired the view from the beach and built a pavilion nearby. A piece of Choi's calligraphy, which he engraved on a rock at Haeundae, still exists.\n\nHaeundae used to be isolated from the large communities in Busan and Busanjin. It remained undeveloped until the late 1970s and early 1980s. A small number of luxury hotels were constructed after the 1988 Seoul Olympics. More hotels and other tourist facilities have been constructed on the beach-front area since the mid-1990s, and shopping malls and movie theatre complexes have been built in the 'centre' of Haeundae: an area between Haeundae Station and the beach. The area has continued to grow, apart from during the Asian financial crisis of 1997.\n\nHaeundae has been a regular host of the annual Busan International Film Festival (BIFF). Haeundae's Dongbaek Island was the location for the 2005 APEC Conference.\n\nHaeundae New Town (해운대 신시가지, 海雲臺 新市街地, Haeundae Sinsigaji), a major commercial and residential redevelopment project begun in 1990, is located in the Jwa-dong area. This area lies in the southern shadow of Jangsan mountain to the north, and is bounded in the south by Haeundae Station on the Dalmaji Gogae line of the Korean National Railroad. Another development project, Centum City, has been ongoing since early 2000 and is now a major feature of Busan. Its BEXCO (Busan Exhibition and Convention Center) has become a popular venue for international conventions and exhibitions. Marine City, located nearby, is constructed on land reclaimed from the sea, and has several huge, high-rise apartment blocks. Additional apartment blocks are under construction, with water resorts and related facilities, for use by the public, also planned for Marine City.\n\nHaeundae's Dalmaji Hill is touted as one of the eight attractions of Busan, and is noted for its scenic view of the moon. Choe Chi-won (857-10th century), an official and poet from the late Unified Silla Dynasty (668-935), was so struck by its beauty that he decided to extend his stay there. The hill's winding trail that juxtaposes with the ocean is truly awe-inspiring. Some even say that Dalmaji Hill is Busan's answer to Montmartre. The hill is also noted as one of the best places to view cherry blossoms in Busan.\n\nHaeundae beach is regarded as one of the most famous beaches in South Korea. Many events, such as religious events, BIFF movie talks, and company promotions, are held here throughout the year. The area around the beach is very developed, featuring many residential high rises and shopping centers.\n\nHaeundae is popular in South Korean media as a setting or filming location due to being one of South Korea's most famous beaches and affluent communities. The district was the setting of the movie \"Haeundae', a South Korean disaster movie based on the relatively unlikely scenario of an immense tsunami hitting the city of Busan. Haeundae has been featured in numerous K-Dramas, with the beach and Dongbaekseom Island being used as a filming location for Seoul Broadcasting System's 2008 drama \"Star's Lover\". The island was the location for the scene where Lee Ma-ri, played by Choi Ji-woo confesses her love for Kim Chul Soo, played by Yoo Ji-tae; and the couple takes a walk on the beach. In 2012, KBS2 broadcast a drama, \"Haeundae Lovers\", using Busan and the district as a backdrop. Much of the story takes place in Cheongsapo, a coastal community in the district east of Haeundae Beach.\n\nHauendae is home to the Busan Cinema Center, the location of the annual Busan International Film Festival, which features 5 inside theaters and 1 outside theater.\n\nHaeundae is also a popular culinary destination, boasting both traditional and foreign cuisines. Many restaurants sell dwaejigukbab (pork rice soup), one of Busan's signature dishes. The market has a wide array of seafood available, notably eel. Gumsu-Bukkuk, South Korea's most famous puffer fish stew restaurant, has its original location in Haeundae. Additionally, visitors can buy seafood from food trucks that line the beachfront.\n\nHaeundae has a relatively large expatriate population (in Busan) and foreign cuisines are relatively popular, including Indian, Brazilian, and American. High-end cuisine can be found in many of Haeundae's hotels, as well as in Centum City and on Dalmaji Hill.\n\nHaeundae-gu is divided into 7 legal \"dong\", which altogether comprise 18 administrative \"dong\", as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Calderone began to dabble with turntables and other DJ-related equipment at the age of 15. A decade later, in 1991, music mogul Seymour Stein signed both Calderone and his partner Gene LaFosse (they collaborated on a short-lived techno act called Program 2) to a contract deal with Sire Records. Shortly after the release of their first album, the group disbanded and Calderone took a self-imposed exile away from the music industry.\n\nDuring the time he removed himself from the club music industry, Calderone worked in the restaurant business but eventually was encouraged to work on new projects including his first solo record, \"Give It Up\". Calderone later returned to #1 for two weeks in 2001 with \"Are You Satisfied?,\" featuring vocals by Deborah Cooper.\n\nFurther inspired by New York's then-thriving club scene, Calderone landed gigs at many major events in the city. Calderone obtained residencies at both the Roxy in New York and Liquid in Miami Beach. He then met and commenced a successful relationship with Madonna in 1998. Impressed by Calderone's innovative vision and style, he was commissioned to remix \"Frozen\", the first single released from her \"Ray of Light\" album. Since 1998, he has remixed eleven other singles for Madonna: Ray of Light, Sky Fits Heaven, Skin, Beautiful Stranger, American Pie, Music, Don't Tell Me, What it Feels like for a Girl, Die Another Day, Hollywood.\n\nFollowing up on Madonna's recommendation, Sting selected Calderone to remix his song \"Desert Rose,\" the second single from his 1999 \"Brand New Day\" album. The British singer did not only hire Calderone to remix the single, which was something he had never done before with his music, but even returned to the studio with him to re-record the vocals to match the remixed song's new dance-oriented rhythms. The song spent 80 weeks on the Billboard dance chart including nine consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart.\n\nBesides his work with Madonna and Sting, his credits as remixer includes work for such artists as Beyoncé Knowles, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and Sarah Brightman, amongst others.\n\nHe has also collaborated with other house music producers—including Mac Quayle and most notably Peter Rauhofer, the first Grammy Award winner in the Dance Music category. Their joint effort, known as The Collaboration released a popular multi-CD set and several hit single tracks.\n\nAfter a long string of successful albums and singles, Calderone established his Evolve brand in 2005 as a way to coalesce his numerous residencies around the world, including Montreal, Tel Aviv, Bulgaria, and a monthly residency at New York's Pacha. With the Evolve brand now taking off globally, clubgoers have quickly begun to equate the word with joy-inducing, risk-taking sets that shatter musical boundaries and the conventions of what a DJ set “should” be.\n\nCalderone resides with his wife Athena, and their son in Brooklyn.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2201074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201074", "title": "Mission burrito", "text": "Mission burrito\n\nA Mission burrito (also known as a San Francisco burrito or a Mission-style burrito) is a type of burrito that first became popular during the 1960s in the Mission District of San Francisco, California. It is distinguished from other burritos by its large size and inclusion of extra rice and other ingredients. A key method to the burritos' construction is to steam the wheat flour tortilla to increase its flexibility prior to adding the other ingredients, although that is not a requirement and burritos may be grilled instead. It has been referred to as one of three major styles of burritos in the United States, following the earlier, simple burrito consisting of beans, rice, and meat. It precedes the California burrito, which was developed in the 1980s and contains cheese and potatoes.\nMany taquerías in the Mission and greater San Francisco Bay Area specialize in Mission burritos. It is typically a large flour tortilla that is wrapped and folded around a variety of ingredients, served in a piece of aluminum foil. A food critic for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" counted hundreds of taquerias in the Bay Area, and noted that the question of which taqueria makes the best burrito can \"encourage fierce loyalty and ferocious debate\". New York-based writer Calvin Trillin said that the burrito in San Francisco \"has been refined and embellished in much the same way that the pizza has been refined and embellished in Chicago\". Since its commercial availability began in the 1960s, the style has spread widely throughout the United States and Canada.\n\nLong-time residents of the Mission District trace the origins of the Mission burrito back to the 1960s. The owners of \"La Cumbre\" Taqueria near Valencia and 16th have been credited as the first taqueria to sell this style of burrito. The creation of the style is credited to Raul and Micaela Duran who sold burritos from their meat market, which, in 1972, they converted into the La Cumbre Taqueria. They date the birth of the San Francisco burrito to September 29, 1969.\nHowever, like most such claims, this is debated by others who claim to remember similar burritos from earlier in the decade. If the claims of the owner of \"El Faro\" are true, the first San Francisco burrito was sold September 26, 1961 to a group of San Francisco firefighters, using two 6-inch tortillas in place of what later became the large single tortilla. The fact that he did not have—and had not previously considered the need for—larger tortillas suggests that the birth of the Mission burrito as we now know it did not come earlier than that time. Yet the Mission burrito does have historical forebears in burritos made elsewhere. Some assert that the original San Francisco burritos were directly inspired by burritos brought by California Central Valley farmworkers into the fields, then reproduced in the city. One restaurant consultant remembered his teen years in the fields this way:\n\nOther burrito researchers trace the burrito's ancestry even further back to miners of the 19th century. The first printed references to burritos came in the 1930s; in the 1950s and 1960s, versions of the burrito spread through the American Southwest and beyond.\n\nBut while the Mexican-American burrito began as a wider regional phenomenon, most would agree that the Mission burrito emerged as a recognizable and distinct local culinary movement during the 1970s and 1980s. One writer asserts that the Mission burrito—a large, compact and quite cheap meal—played a special role for those who lived through the local economic recession of the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nDuring the dot-com boom, the Mission District saw rapid gentrification, with lower paid workers forced out of the area by increasing rents. One anti-gentrification activist denounced the way that chain restaurants like Green Burrito were taking over the area, selling more expensive, \"Anglo\" versions of the burrito.\n\nThe rhetoric of burrito politics underscores the role of the Mission burrito in both bohemian and Chicano culture in San Francisco, as evidenced by a 1993 article published in the \"SF Weekly\", featuring Chicano Studies professor Jose Cuellar.\n\nThough an authentic mission burrito is made in San Francisco's Mission District at family owned Mexican restaurants called \"taquerias\", Chipotle Mexican Grill, Qdoba Mexican Grill, Panchero's Mexican Grill, Freebirds World Burrito, Barberitos, and Taco del Mar are large national chains in North America that arguably offer versions of a San Francisco style burrito. Chipotle was started by a chef who directly acknowledges the inspiration of Mission taquerias. The New York City–based restaurant chain BurritoVille, which existed from 1992 to 2008, specialized in San Francisco–style burritos. Atlanta was home to one of the first San Francisco–style burrito restaurants on the East Coast, called Tortillas, from the mid-1980s until the early 2000s.\nSome New York establishments advertise \"Cal-Mex\" or \"San Francisco style\" burritos. Two chains of Boston taquerias (Anna's Taqueria and Boca Grande Taqueria) are directly modeled after a local Bay Area chain, and other burrito businesses also cite the influence of San Francisco burritos.\n\nBurritos made in the San Francisco style can be found in other cities across the United States.\n\nA small chain of establishments have been appearing in the UK under the name \"Mission Burrito\" selling Mission-style burritos in Oxford, Reading, and Bristol. M4 Burritos, with two Montreal locations, also claims to serve Mission-inspired fare.\n\nThe aluminum foil wrapping, which is present whether the customer is eating in the restaurant or taking out, acts as structural support to ensure that the tortilla does not rupture.\n\nDiners eating Mission burritos customarily forgo utensils entirely and eat the burrito with their hands, tearing the foil gradually down as they eat from above, but keeping the foil on the bottom to continue to support the structure of the uneaten portion. Adding salsa to the burrito before each subsequent bite is a popular practice.\n\n"}

He's a CIA agent but despises the government. He's a pacifist but carries a gun. He's as much in love with his 17-year-old stepsister as he is with a 46-year-old nun. Switters feels that the core of the universe and the basis of human existence, is the paradox of light and dark co-existing together. One is not separate from the other; they just co-exist . This is the main idea of \"Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates\", along with an interest in the Lady of Fatima and a squawking parrot. The title of the novel comes from Arthur Rimbaud's \"A Season in Hell\", in which he daydreams about becoming one of \"ces féroces infirmes retour des pays chauds.\"\n\nSwitters grew up in the Seattle area and was raised primarily by his grandmother Maestra. His parents separated when he was young. His mother remarried and has a step daughter named Suzy.\n\nWhen we first meet Switters he is 35 years old. He just came back from a mission and visited his grandmother Maestra in Seattle. He is obviously attached to her although she does not tolerate his mannerism. He does anything she asks of him, which is how he ends up in, as he puts it, \"South too-damn-vivid America.\"\n\nSwitters refrains from the more tedious routines of modern life, which he calls collectively \"maintenance\" - showering, shaving, primping of any kind, and though he has quite an appetite, especially for red-eye gravy, he can't abide to think of the process of excretion. He does not visualize his internal organs, nor their processes. Instead he envisions his viscera as more of a white ball of healing light. While this may smack of New-Age mysticism, Switters himself is aware of his own self-deception while at the same time reveling in it.\n\nAs presumably does any other member of a national intelligence office, Switters has a few secrets. His most private was his love of show tunes. In the crocodile-skin valise in which he keeps his laptop and his gun, he also has, in a secret compartment, a CD of Broadway tunes, which he listens to in both his darkest and most joyous moments. He is heard - or overheard - singing lines from one of Stephen Sondheim's most famous songs—\"Send in the Clowns\".\n\nHis primary character trait is his obsession with innocence. He is willing to accept anything that anyone does, so long as it is pure - comes from that person's own experience and beliefs, as opposed to simply following orders, instructions, or creed. He cares little for the practice of religion, perceiving it as corrupt, but has studied the Bible, Qur'an, and various mythologies. The exception to this is Zen, which he practices vaguely for the most part, though he does practice zazen.\n\nLike many obsessions, his drive for innocence and purity spills over into his love life. Throughout the novel he carries on a very flirtatious - and occasionally salacious - email dialog with his 17-year-old stepsister Suzy. After his visit to South America, he spends some time convalescing in Sacramento at his mother's house, a setting that puts him in dangerously close proximity to the object of his affection, who despite a bit of hesitation, returns her paramour's attention.\n\nLater in the novel, Switters falls in love with a 46-year-old nun, who despite her age, Switters finds just as pure as young Suzy.\n\nSwitters' best friend whom he worked with in the CIA in Thailand and also shares an attraction to underage women.\n\nThe parrot that Switter must release in \"too god damn vivid South America\".\n\nSwitters' Grandmother. Although she would never let him call her that.\n\nSwitters' seventeen-year-old stepsister who lives in Sacramento, California, US. She later lives with Maestra who resides in Seattle Washington, US. Switters falls in love with Suzy, due to his \"attraction to innocence.\"\n\nThe nun in a Syrian Catholic convent with whom Switters falls in love.\n\nThis is the abbess of the disavowed, Catholic, oasis-based convent in which Switters comes to stay in for over a year later in the book.\n\n\"Today Is Tomorrow\" is a shaman who casts a curse on Switters. Alternately, he is called \"The End of Time\" in the beginning of the book, due to a mistranslation of the native language.\n\n"}

They currently play in the Eerste Divisie (second tier of Dutch football), and are one of two professional clubs which are based in the city of Eindhoven, the other one being PSV Eindhoven.\n\nFC Eindhoven play their home games at Jan Louwers Stadion, on the southern part of the city. The club's official colours are blue and white, hence their nickname \"Blauw-Witten\" (The Blue-Whites).\n\nThe club was founded on 16 November 1909 as EVV Eindhoven. A couple of Gentleman had seen that the clubs in the North area called the Randstad were growing and felt there was a need for a new team in Eindhoven too. Decided was to found a new club under the name E.V.V. short for Eindhovense Voetbal Vereniging. Club colours were blue and white, the blue came from the crest of the city Eindhoven at that time. E.V.V. start to play in the Brabantse Voetbalbond, a regional league, but a couple of years after they start to play in the NVB, the National League. In 1921 E.V.V. fuses with Gestel (local team) and changes its name to E.V.V. Eindhoven. At the end of the 30s Eindhoven has his first bit of success as they got hold of the Dutch Cup, the KNVB Beker (1937). In 1939 E.V.V. Eindhoven is the new Champion of the 1st Division Region South and plays for the title of The Netherlands with teams like DWS, NEC, Ajax and Achilles 1894. They finish 4th.\n\nIn 1950 E.V.V. Eindhoven has their first Dutch international in the name of Noud van Melis. Frans Tebak and Dick Snoek were to follow in his footsteps soon. In 1954, Eindhoven were the last Dutch league champions before the introduction of the professional league. After turning professional in 1954, the club played in the Eredivisie until 1957, when Eindhoven were relegated to the Eerste Divisie. In 1969 they were even relegated to the Tweede Divisie. Two years later, the club secured promotion back to the Eerste Divisie, and in 1975, Eindhoven were promoted to the Eredivisie. In 1977, Eindhoven were relegated back to the Eerste Divisie, where it has remained ever since. In 1997 E.V.V. Eindhoven left the professional scene and is once again an amateur club. A new professional club SBV Eindhoven (Stichting Betaald Voetbal Eindhoven) was founded, this name was in 2002 changed to FC Eindhoven.\n\nIn the 2009–2010 season FC Eindhoven qualified for playoffs to advance to the Eredivisie. Eindhoven advanced past the first round defeating AGOVV Apeldoorn 4–2 goal aggregate. Eindhoven was pitted against possible relegation from Eredivisie club Willem II and were narrowly defeated 3–2 aggregate. So they will remain in the Eerste Divisie. In 2011/2012 FC Eindhoven had a fantastic season and finished 3rd, despite Ernest Faber leaving FC Eindhoven as manager to join Dick Advocaat at PSV to be his assistant in March 2012. The club lost 3–0 to Helmond Sport over two legs, 1–0 in the first and 2–0 in the second, in Round 2 of the promotion playoffs.\n\nErwin Koeman, the replacement of Ernest Faber, left in the summer of 2012 and was replaced by John Lammers. Under Lammers the 12–13 season finished in a disappointing 16th spot, only above two sides whose points totals had been set at zero due to bankruptcy. The 13–14 season was a big improvement with the club finishing 6th and qualifying for the promotion play-offs. There they encountered Sparta Rotterdam to whom they lost to 3–1 on aggregate.\n\nFC Eindhoven's biggest rivalry is with neighbours PSV Eindhoven, against whom they contest the \"Lichtstad Derby\" ('City of Light Derby'). However, the clubs have not faced each other in league competition since the 1976–77 season. FC Eindhoven used to be a bigger club than PSV in the period between 1930 and 1955. PSV was a club for the workers of Phillips and seen as a club for the privileged while FC Eindhoven was seen as the people's club. In 2004, FC Eindhoven contracted a co-operation deal with neighbours PSV Eindhoven, meaning the possibility of swapping youth players between the two clubs.\n\nNowadays, Helmond Sport are seen as the biggest rivals. The clubs are about 15 km apart and have been playing in the same league for years.\n\n\nBelow is a table with FC Eindhoven's domestic results since the introduction of professional football in 1956.\n\n\n\n"}

The manufacturer Nestlé says that the bar was introduced by George Williamson and his Williamson Candy Company of Chicago in 1920 in United States. The most popular alternate story is that Thomas Henry, manager of the Peerless Candy Co. in Arkansas City, Kansas, invented a bar he called the \"Tom Henry Bar\" in the late 1910s, and sold the recipe to George Williamson in 1920. There is no credible documentation of this story, however.\n\nThere are also alternate accounts of the origin of the name of the bar. The story supported by Nestlé is that there was a boy named Henry who frequented George Williamson's second candy shop. He became a favorite of the young girls who worked there, who would say \"Oh Henry\" when speaking to or about him, and Williamson used this phrase to name his new confection. The other (undocumented) story is that the name was changed from the Tom Henry Bar to Oh Henry! when it was purchased by Williamson. Popular myths are that it was named after O. Henry or Henry Aaron.\nThe Williamson Company was sold to Warner-Lambert in 1965, which soon sold Oh Henry! to Terson, Inc. Nestlé acquired the United States rights to the brand from Terson in 1984. In 2018, Nestlé sold the rights to its US confectionery products to Ferrara Candy Company, a subsidiary of Ferrero SpA.\n\nIn Canada, the bar is currently sold by The Hershey Company and was manufactured at their Smiths Falls, Ontario facilities prior to their closure. The bars are different in appearance: the Canadian version is one bar with the fudge in the center, the fudge surrounded with a thin layer of caramel, and the nuts surrounding that layer before it is surrounded in the coating. Hershey sells Oh Henry! bars made in Canada on a very limited basis in the United States as Rally bars, using the trademark of a Hershey product introduced in the 1970s and later discontinued.\n\nIn the \"Seinfeld\" episode \"The Caddy\", the fictional character Sue Ellen Mischke is the heiress to the Oh Henry! candy bar fortune.\n\nWhenever former MLB outfielder Henry Rodríguez hit a homerun, fans would throw Oh Henry! bars onto the field.\n\nGilbert Gottfried appeared in a number of television commercials, including for Oh Henry! in 1987.\n\n\n"}

A spin-off of New World Computing's \"Might and Magic\" series of role-playing video games, the success of \"Heroes of Might and Magic\" led to a number of sequels.\n\nIn 1996, NWC released an updated version of the game, ported to Windows 95. This new version included a map editor, random map generator, CD audio, and new scenarios. As a bonus, \"King's Bounty\" was also included on the CD.\n\nHeroes of Might and Magic tells the story of Lord Morglin Ironfist, who is forced to flee his homeland through a magical portal, because his cousin, Ragnar, had usurped the throne after his uncle, Ragnar's father, killed Ironfist's father, the legitimate owner of the throne.\n\nHe finds himself along with his few followers in a strange and uncharted land, called Enroth. The land is unruled but contested by Ironfist and three other warlords: the barbarian Lord Slayer, the sorceress Queen Lamanda, and the warlock Lord Alamar.\n\nIn the canonical storyline, Lord Ironfist defeats his three opponents and founds a new kingdom in Enroth. It is possible for the player to lead the other factions to victory, however this is not reflected in the following games of the Heroes of Might and Magic series.\n\n\"Heroes of Might and Magic\" takes place in a medieval fantasy world filled with creatures frequently associated with myth and legend. These creatures compose the military forces (troops) with which the player attempts to conquer opponents. The player leads generals through the game world at the head of armies of troops. These generals, called \"heroes,\" provide a means to explore, attack, defeat, and acquire, the four basic principles in the game. The ultimate goal of the game is usually to capture all enemy castles and defeat all enemy heroes. However, the game comes with many different play scenarios, and some of these scenarios have unique victory conditions, such as accumulating a certain amount of gold, or finding a particular artifact.\n\nThere are four different classes of heroes and castles, each with their own units and strengths/weaknesses. The two \"might\" classes, Knight and Barbarian, earn skill points in attack or defense more often than in spell power or knowledge. The two \"magic\" classes, Sorceress and Warlock, earn skill points in spell power or knowledge more often than in attack or defense. There is also a neutral, \"wandering\" class of troops, including Rogues, Nomads, Ghosts (the only one that cannot be hired) and Genies.\n\n\"Heroes of Might and Magic\" was first released near the end of September 1995.\n\nIn mid-November 1995, New World Computing reported that \"Heroes of Might and Magic\" had shipped 100,000 copies to retailers and that sell-through was strong. The company announced that the game was \"set to top the 100,000 mark in unit sales\". By October 1997, the combined sales of \"Heroes of Might and Magic\", \"Heroes II\" and the \"Price of Loyalty\" expansion had surpassed 500,000 copies. The series as a whole sold 1.5 million copies by December 1999.\n\nAndy Butcher reviewed \"Heroes of Might and Magic\" for \"Arcane\" magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that \"Its very simplicity, although ultimately limiting, is appealing, and the computer opponents are far from easy to beat. In terms of depth and long-term interest it's not a real challenger to MicroProse's \"Master of Magic\", which it resembles, but it is a whole lot simpler to get into.\"\n\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\" assessed that \"\"Heroes of Might and Magic\" is part wargame, part adventure, and part sim. It seamlessly captures the best of all three genres, and presents the whole package with bright, colorful visuals.\" He further applauded the game for being \"easy to learn, but difficult to master\" and having great longevity. He scored it four out of five stars. \"GameSpot\" rated the game's production values as somewhat below par, and regarded the story as being thin. Nonetheless, the game was complimented for its gameplay, and received a 7.5 out of 10 overall. It received a Golden Triad Award from \"Computer Game Review\".\n\n\"Heroes of Might and Magic\" was named 1995's best turn-based strategy game by \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\"—tied with \"Jagged Alliance\"—and best overall strategy title by \"Computer Game Review\" and \"Computer Gaming World\", tied variously with \"Command & Conquer\", \"Gazillionaire\" and \"Blood Bowl\". Similarly, \"PC Gamer US\" nominated \"Heroes\" for its 1995 \"Best Strategy Game\" award, although this prize went instead to \"Command & Conquer\". The editors of \"Computer Gaming World\" wrote, \"\"Heroes\" will challenge you to think and plan, and it will reward you with hours of sheer pleasure. It is one of the most addictive games to come along in years.\"\n\nIn 1996, \"Computer Gaming World\" declared \"Heroes of Might and Magic\" the 133th-best computer game ever released. The editors called it \"a brilliantly balanced game of fantasy combat\".\n"}

He played college football for the University of Illinois after transferring from Purdue. George was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts with the first overall pick of the 1990 NFL Draft, and also played for the Atlanta Falcons, Oakland Raiders, Minnesota Vikings, Washington Redskins, and Seattle Seahawks of the NFL.\n\nGeorge was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. He attended Warren Central High School, where he was awarded the Dial Award for the national high school scholar-athlete of the year in 1985 and was the first Gatorade National Player of the Year. Collegiately, he attended Purdue University and the University of Illinois.\n\nGeorge transferred after a year at Purdue when the coach who recruited him, Leon Burtnett, resigned. Burtnett's replacement was Fred Akers, who had been known for his teams that used a run-heavy option type offense that required a more mobile quarterback. George subsequently committed to the University of Miami, but he backed out when coach Jimmy Johnson would not guarantee him a starting job. George stayed at Illinois for two years, leaving with a year of eligibility remaining after being assured he would be drafted as one of the first five picks of the NFL draft (he was picked No. 1 overall).\n\nHe would finish his college career with 6,212 yards and 35 touchdowns and 35 interceptions. In 1989, he threw for 2,738 yards with 22 TD vs 12 INT.\n\nThe Colts traded to draft George, making him the first pick in the 1990 draft, and signed him to the richest rookie contract in NFL history at the time (worth a total of $15 million). George threw 46 interceptions to 41 touchdowns and lost 35 of his 49 career starts as a Colt; his only winning season with the Colts was 1992, during which he played ten games and threw 15 interceptions to seven touchdowns. Before the 1993 season, he refused to report to training camp and only returned to the team when Jim Irsay made it clear that George would have to pay a huge penalty fee for breach of contract if he did not get back to work. The Colts traded George to the Atlanta Falcons after the 1993 season.\n\nIn 1995, George led the Falcons to their first playoff appearance since 1991. On September 22, 1996, in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles, George got into a heated argument on the sidelines with then-Falcons coach June Jones, all of which was caught on camera for a national television audience. Jones suspended George for the remainder of the 1996 season and Atlanta dealt George to the Oakland Raiders after the season. It was later confirmed that George blamed team management for his problems and felt Jones betrayed him by not standing up to this alleged mistreatment. Years after the incident, Jones actually became an advocate for George, stating that the TV argument was overblown and George was actually a good quarterback, a team player and worthy of being on an NFL roster.\n\nGeorge's record with the Falcons was 16–19; he had the best completion percentage (60.5) of his career with 50 touchdowns and 32 interceptions.\n\nGeorge signed with the Oakland Raiders after leaving Atlanta. In the 1997 season opener, George was a part of NFL history. George's first start as a Raider also happened to be the first NFL regular-season game played in the state of Tennessee. The Oilers, in their first home game since their controversial relocation from Houston, ruined George's debut (he threw three touchdowns to Tim Brown) by beating the Raiders, 24-21, on an Al Del Greco field goal in overtime. Another notable moment for the Silver and Black came in Week 8; against the visiting Broncos, George delivered a workmanlike performance (9-12, 96 yards, 2 TD, 1 INT). Thanks in large part to Napoleon Kaufman's 227-yard performance on the ground, the host Raiders upset the eventual world champions, 28-25. In his eighth year in the NFL, he had arguably his finest statistical year, throwing for 29 touchdown passes and 9 interceptions, for a 91.2 passer rating. However, despite George's stellar statistics, the team struggled overall; their defense finished 28th in scoring. Oakland finished 4–12 in Joe Bugel's one and only season as the Raiders' head coach. \n\nThe next year, the offense had changed to head coach Jon Gruden's West Coast scheme, a controlled-pass approach, that did not suit George's strengths. George was inconsistent at the beginning of the year, and later struggled with a groin pull, telling a local radio audience that he was finished for the year. He also ignored the offensive coordinator's play calls during the 1998 season and ran his own plays through a wristband containing plays (in an interview, George told Joe Theismann that he did what the coaches wanted on 1st and 2nd down, and simply threw it to Tim Brown on 3rd down). The Raiders ended George's Oakland tenure when they signed free-agent quarterback Rich Gannon.\n\nGeorge next played for the Vikings, where he was backup to Randall Cunningham. Cunningham struggled at the start of the 1999 season and was benched. George took over the starting role, in 10 games as a starter going 8–2 with 23 touchdowns, 8.6 yards per attempt and a 94.2 rating in leading Minnesota to the playoffs. George won his first career playoff game, throwing three touchdown passes to lead the Vikings over the Dallas Cowboys 27–10. The Vikings lost the next week to the eventual Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams 49–37. When George took too long to agree to terms with the Vikings in the offseason, they chose not to renew George's contract. George ended up signing with the Washington Redskins.\n\nGeorge hoped to return to Minnesota as a starting quarterback but he was told by head coach Dennis Green to \"shop around\". After attempting to speak to other teams about securing a starting quarterback job he was eventually offered a one year, $400,000 contract by Minnesota, with incentives totaling up to $1.4 million. Rather than sign with the Vikings George signed a four-year contract worth $14.8 million with the Washington Redskins as Brad Johnson's backup. Johnson went down in week 9; George replaced him, and went 1–2 in the next three games. Johnson returned, but played poorly against the New York Giants. George replaced him and started two games, both losses, after Norv Turner was fired in favor of interim coach Terry Robiskie. After the season, Johnson departed Washington for Tampa Bay, leaving George as the Redskins' starter going into 2001.\n\nBefore the 2001 season, Washington hired Marty Schottenheimer as head coach, and Schottenheimer promised to install a West Coast scheme similar to that of Gruden in Oakland. George clashed with Schottenheimer over the offense, though Schottenheimer promised to work George through any problems he might have with the scheme. Washington released George on the heels of a 37–0 Monday Night loss to the Green Bay Packers in which George had a 34.6 passer rating: the worst passer rating of the first two weeks of the 2001 season. The Redskins were 0–2, having been outscored by opponents 67–3. George was given 24 hours to remove all his personal items from the Redskins' facilities before they would be discarded. He was replaced by Tony Banks who led the Redskins to an 8-8 record after an 0-5 start.\n\nGeorge seemingly retired after his last game in Washington, but he proceeded to make several sideline appearances in the following years. He signed briefly with the Seattle Seahawks in late 2002 as an emergency quarterback.\n\nIn 2004, after two years away from the game, the Chicago Bears became the seventh NFL team to employ George, signing him to a one-year contract in November for a partial season backup role, but he never took the field during a game, and was not retained by the Bears for the 2005 season, and was not signed by any team. The Detroit Lions worked him out during their bye week in the event they needed another quarterback; however, George was not offered a contract.\n\nOn August 28, 2006, the Oakland Raiders signed George. He was expected to compete for the third-string quarterback position.\n\nWhile George spent time on active NFL rosters through 2006, he had not attempted a pass since the 2001 season with the Washington Redskins. It was speculated that he might have replaced third-string quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo due to his friendship with Randy Moss. Moss has previously stated that George was his favorite of all the quarterbacks he's worked with. He has also commented in the past that he and George would take weekend fishing trips together when they both lived in Minnesota.\n\nOn October 30, 2007 during \"Mike and Mike in the Morning\", Michael Kim in a \"SportsCenter\" update reported that George was interested in making another comeback, this time with the Minnesota Vikings, a team where he once had some success.\n\nIn November 2008, in an appearance on Sirius NFL Radio, George said, \"I find it hard to believe there isn't a place in the game for me. My arm feels like I'm 25\", he said. \"I'm not asking to be a starter, I just want a spot on a team. I still hold out hope I can play in this league. I'm working out three or four days a week, staying ready. Some people might laugh about it. I've been hearing the excuse, 'You're too old,' but I look at guys now playing near 40, and if you can throw it like I can throw it ... Why wouldn't you take a look at me?\" He said of coming back: \"I’ve been trying to figure out how to get back in, and it just amazes me that I’m not on somebody's roster. I’ve been throwing two or three times a week, and every time I go out there to throw, I can’t believe I’m not a backup somewhere. I know it's a young man's game, but you can’t tell me I’m not better than some of the quarterbacks that are out there. I look at teams like Minnesota or Chicago, and I want to scream at the people in charge, ‘What are you thinking?’\"\n\nOn August 4, 2010, George announced on KFAN Sports radio in Minnesota that he would have been willing to step in for veteran QB Brett Favre if Favre had decided to retire from the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nGeorge has made occasional appearances on \"NFL Total Access\" with Rich Eisen and Terrell Davis. Following George's final seasons in the NFL, Jason Whitlock wrote several columns expressing his belief that George could still play and was deserving of an NFL try-out. George and Whitlock are longtime friends, having played high school football together.\n\n"}

A physically talented and graceful martial artist, Lam was best known for playing the stoic Taoist priest in \"Mr. Vampire\" (1985). He had a reputation for being disciplined, headstrong, restrained, and self-willed. As an actor, action choreographer, martial artist, and teacher he touched many people with his candor and uncompromising professionalism. Lam died in 1997 of liver cancer.\n\nHe was born Lam Gun-bo (林根寶) on 27 December 1952 in the year of the Dragon, in Hong Kong. His family originated from Shanghai, in the People's Republic Of China. Both of his parents made a living by doing catering services. Lam was the third child of six children. His family was poor, and his parents weren't educated. Lam attended Shun Yi Association Elementary School in Hong Kong, but eventually dropped out after 2 years. His father sent him to Chun Chau Drama Society to learn the Peking Opera style under the guidance of Madame Fan Fok Fa.\n\nDue to his slender and fragile body structure, Lam specialized in female roles and often performed stunt-doubling for actresses. However, he was reported as a mischievous and disobedient child. Thus, after half a year of training, Madame sent him on stage to express himself and control his drive. Lam's first show was called \"White Beach\", but his Beijing Opera career only lasted for 5 years. He realized that there was not much demand for opera styles anymore. Through a friend's introduction, Lam joined the film industry.\n\nAt age 17, Lam became a stuntman and martial arts coach at the Shaw Brothers Studio. Due to his slender build, he was often called upon to substitute female actors. He received $HK60 a day, $HK20 of which went to his master, and another $HK20 he took home to his parents. Lam used the remaining money to treat his brothers to snacks. Lam once mentioned those were his happiest days in his life.\n\nThere was a story that Lam challenged Bruce Lee in a hotel room because he didn't believe Lee was as strong as the rumors said. Lam put a pillow over his chest and stomach, then Bruce struck the pillow and sent him flying across the room. Bruce Lee was so impressed that he hired Lam as his personal assistant. Lam was 19 at the time.\n\nLam started to work as an co-action choreographer, and personal assistant to Bruce Lee on Lee's movies including \"The Big Boss\", \"Fist of Fury\", \"Enter the Dragon\", \"Way of the Dragon\", and \"Game of Death\". In his youth, Lam seemed to have quite a temper and always got into fights. During the filming of \"The Big Boss\", Lam was arrested for fighting, and Lee had to bail him out of jail.\n\nDespite having little education, Lam impressed Lee with interesting philosophical discussions. Although they hardly talked about their relationship, Lee liked good conversations, and this self-willed young man soon became Lee's favorite.\nWhen Lee died, Lam was devastated. He later joined Hung's stuntman association (known as the Hung Kar Pan).\n\nLam worked behind the camera as assistant director and became Sammo's right-hand man of the stunt team. His talent as an actor and martial artist was revealed in \"The Magnificent Butcher\". Lam played the fan-wielding assassin who fought against Yuen Biao.\n\nIn 1982, Lam won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Director, in the film \"Prodigal Son\". \"Prodigal Son\" featured what is widely acknowledged as among the best Wing Chun caught on film, performed by Lam. Lam played the strict kung fu master Leung Yee-tai. This was probably his most historic role. Lam even shaved his own eyebrows to give Master Leung a more feminine portrayal. He was able to bring a cool, sweet quality to this sharp and hard-nosed character.\n\nHe also played a frail, elderly Taoist priest in \"The Dead and the Deadly\" (1983).\n\nLam's star did not rise until 1985, with the release of \"Mr. Vampire\", the movie that fueled the \"hopping vampire\" genre. Lam was nominated for Best Actor for his role as the Taoist priest. The character was an engaging mixture of naivety and stoic authority, and became a favorite for audiences. Lam was to reprise this role many times throughout his career.\n\nShortly after the release of \"Mr. Vampire\", the Golden Harvest film company attempted to make an English version of the movie with Tanya Roberts (of Charlie's Angels) and Jack Scalia. Lam's role was played by longtime kung fu film actor Yuen Wah. Due to various difficulties, the film was never made.\n\nIn the following years, Lam starred as the Taoist Priest in countless sequels and spin-offs of Mr. Vampire such as \"Mr. Vampire II\" (1986), \"Mr. Vampire III\" (1987), \"Vampire Vs. Vampire\" (1989), \"Magic Cop\" (1990), \"Encounters of the Spooky Kind II\" (1990)\n\nHe also appeared in different movie genres such as \"The Return of Pom Pom\" (1984), \"School on Fire\" (1988), \"Painted Faces\" (1988), and \"Her Vengeance\" (1988). Lam proved that his dramatic acting skill was just as good as his kung fu skill. It is argued that whether the huge success of \"Mr. Vampire\" was the best thing that happened in his career because it forever typecast him as the vampire slayer. Yet Lam had many heartbreaking and mind-stirring portrayals in other movie genres.\n\nIn 1989, Lam directed his first movie \"Vampire Vs. Vampire\". The movie starred him as the usual One Eyebrow Priest, Chin Siu Ho and Liu Fong as his naughty disciples. Due to the production cost going over budget, he didn't take his director's fee. The movie showed light of his moving-making style which was prone to realistic fights and dark humor. The movie didn't become a huge success, but his candor made people re-think the purposes of film-making. It also suggested new ideas in the genre which later influenced other Hong Kong ghost movies. Vampire Vs. Vampire offered a new look about the encounter between Chinese and Western culture. The One Eyebrow Priest also raised a vampire kid in his own house. This went against traditional rules of Maoshan Taoism. Even until now, people often find Lam Ching Ying's shadow in later Chinese ghost movies.\n\nThe success of \"Mr. Vampire\" eventually became burdensome on Lam, who found himself typecast in the role. As the Hong Kong movie industry began to experience a decline, quality roles for Lam also began to dry. However, he continued to take on his usual role as the Taoist priest as well as supporting roles in low budget movies.\n\nIn 1990, Lam became the film producer for \"Magic Cop\" (1990), an underrated action movie. He starred in and action directed the movie. The fight scenes between him and the Japanese again showed his excellence as an action choreographer.\n\nSome of his other ghost movies during these years are \"Crazy Safari\" (1991), \"An Eternal Combat\" (1991), \"The Ultimate Vampire\" (1991) \"Spiritual Trinity\" (1991), \"Mad Mad Ghost\" (1992), \"Banana Spirit\" (1992). Again, his serious acting side can be seen in \"Pom Pom and Hot Hot\" (1992), \"Lover's Tear\" (1992). He had supporting roles in these movies, but his roles are very memorable.\n\nIn 1995, although the film market was in depression, ATV offered Lam the starring role in a television series called \"Vampire Expert\" (殭屍道長). He was hired with a million HK dollars salary to work in the series. It was a far cry from his time as $HK60 a day stuntman. The series was a success and revived Lam's career. The story followed Mo Siu Fong (Lam Ching Ying) who destroyed ghosts and saved the day. During the filming, Lam developed a relationship with his co-star Kingdom Yuen. In the series, Yuen played a female priest who fell in love with Mo Siu Fong (Lam Ching Ying). At the end of the filming, they were actually in love.\n\nThe second series was filmed and aired in 1996. The series starred Lam Ching Ying again as the humble priest, Mang Hoi, Frankie Lam and Annie Man as his disciples. Like the first series, the second series received high ratings and support from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nSoon after that, Lam signed for another TV series called \"Coincidentally\" (情定阴阳界). The series borrowed the cast of \"Vampire Expert\" and had Lam in a supporting role. Lam played a priest who tried to prevent a man from becoming a cruel spirit. However, this series didn't mark the end of his career. Lam's last role was in \"A Monk at Thirty\" (一枝花和尚). The role was so heartbreaking that many of his fans doubted he was actually playing his own death.\n\nIn 1996, production on the third series of \"Vampire Expert\" began. The production was halted due to Lam's health condition. Contrary to rumors that the cancer was caused by years of heavy drinking, the cancer was hereditary.\n\nLam Ching-ying married Cheng Bing Bing in 1983. They had two children, a daughter Lam Sik-nga (林式瓦) in 1985 and a son Lam Ka-yiu (林家耀) in 1988. The children loved to watch their father's movies. The couple divorced in 1988. Child custody was given to the father. Lam sent his children to the U.S to study.\n\nDuring the filming of Vampire Expert in 1995, Lam and his co-star Kingdom Yuen developed a relationship. However in 1996, Lam broke up with Yuen when they were in love. He then packed up and moved to his sister's house. Yuen talked about Lam after his death: \n\nDuring the summer of 1997 Lam had been repeatedly going to the hospital for tests. Rumours were spreading that he had liver cancer. He stubbornly insisted on leaving the hospital immediately and finishing his job, unwilling to be hospitalised. He received worried phone calls from friends, but he told them not to listen to gossip.\n\nIt is unknown when Lam was diagnosed with cancer for the first time since he forbid his close family to reveal his illness. Some of his close friends stated that they noticed his illness, but no-one dared to ask him directly. Chin Kar Lok said in an interview:\n\nLam broke up with his girlfriend Kingdom Yuen. Two weeks before his death, Lam moved to his sister's house. He refused visits from his children and friends. Lam started to lose his consciousness over and over again at the beginning of November. His family moved him to the St. Teresa Hospital in Kowloon. He was already in a semi-comatose state, and his situation gradually declined.\n\nLam died on November 8th 1997 at 12:30 am at St. Theresa's Hospital in Hong Kong. He died of cancer to the liver he was 44 years old. \n\nLam's request was to have a low-profile funeral. His funeral was attended by his parents, close family and school-mate friends. The Buddhist ceremony was held in the evening of the 13th at around 7 am. His Priest robe, shoes and top-hat were buried with him, along with his favorite clothes and sunglasses.\nLam's pallbearers were Yuen Shiu Hung, Chin Yuet Sun, Ng Ming Hoi, Lam King Chu, Chan Wui Ngai, Chung Fat, Sammo Hung, Chan Wing Hong, Chin Kar Lok and Wu Ma.\n\nAfter the funeral his remains were cremated and buried in the U.S. with a calligraphy:<br>\n\nThe first series of \"My Date with a Vampire\" produced by ATV was dedicated to him, and the entire series was loosely based in the future of \"Vampire Expert\".\n\nThe 2013 Hong Kong horror movie \"Rigor Mortis (film)\" is a tribute to \"Mr. Vampire\", and one of the stars is Lam Ching-Ying's fellow co-star in that film, Chin Siu-ho.\n\n1983 Hong Kong Film Awards\nNominated and won \"\"Best Action Choreography\"\" in Prodigal Son\n\n1984 Hong Kong Film Awards\nNominated and won \"\"Best Action Choreography\"\" in Winners And Sinners\n\n1986 Hong Kong Film Awards\nNominated for \"Best Action Choreography\" in My Lucky Stars\n\n1986 Hong Kong Film Awards\nNominated for \"Best Supporting Actor\" in Mr Vampire\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2201190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201190", "title": "Billfish", "text": "Billfish\n\nThe term billfish refers to a group of predatory fish characterised by prominent bills, or rostra, and by their large size; some are longer than 4 m (13 ft). Billfish include sailfish and marlin, which make up the family Istiophoridae, and swordfish, sole member of the family Xiphiidae. They are apex predators which feed on a wide variety of smaller fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods. These two families are sometimes classified as belonging to the order Istiophoriformes, a group with origins in the Late Cretaceous around 71 million years ago with the two families diverging from one and another in the Late Miocene around 15 million years ago. However, they are also classified as being closely related to the mackerels and tuna within the suborder Scombroidei of the order Perciformes. However, the 5th edition of the Fishes of the World does recognise the Istiophoriformes as a valid order, albeit including the Sphyraenidae, the barracudas.\n\nBillfish are pelagic and highly migratory. They are found in all oceans, although they usually inhabit tropical and subtropical waters; swordfish are found in temperate waters, as well. Billfish use their long spears or sword-like upper beaks to slash at and stun prey during feeding. Their bills can also be used to spear prey, and have been known to spear boats (probably accidentally), but they are not normally used in that way. They are highly valued as gamefish by sports fishermen.\n\nThe term billfish refers to the fishes of the families Xiphiidae and Istiophoridae. These large fishes are \"characterized by the prolongation of the upper jaw, much beyond the lower jaw into a long rostrum which is flat and sword-like (swordfish) or rounded and spear-like (sailfishes, spearfishes, and marlins).\"\n\nThe 12 species of true billfish are divided into two families and five genera. One family, Xiphiidae, contains only one species, the swordfish \"Xiphias gladius\", and the other family, Istiophoridae, contains 11 species in four genera, including marlin, spearfish, and sailfish. Controversy exists about whether the Indo-Pacific blue marlin, \"Makaira mazara\", is the same species as the Atlantic blue marlin, \"M. nigricans\". FishBase follows Nakamura (1985) in recognizing \"M. mazara\" as a distinct species, \"chiefly because of differences in the pattern of the lateral line system\".\n\nA number of other fishes have pronounced bills or beaks, and are sometimes referred to as billfish, despite not being true billfish. Halfbeaks look somewhat like miniature billfish, and the sawfish and sawshark, which are cartilaginous fishes with long, serrated rostrums. Needlefish are sometimes confused with billfish, but they are \"easily distinguished from the true billfish by having both jaws prolonged, the dorsal and anal fins both single and similar in size and shape, and the pelvic fins inserted far behind the pectorals.\" Paddlefish have elongated rostrums containing electroreceptors that can detect weak electrical fields. Paddlefish are filter feeders and may use their rostrum to detect zooplankton.\n\nBillfish have a long, bony, spear-shaped bill, sometimes called a \"snout\", \"beak\" or \"rostrum\". The swordfish has the longest bill, about one-third its body length. Like a true sword, it is smooth, flat, pointed and sharp. The bills of other billfish are shorter and rounder, more like spears.\n\nBillfish normally use their bills to slash at schooling fish. They swim through the fish school at high speed, slashing left and right, and then circle back to eat the fish they stunned. Adult swordfish have no teeth, and other billfish have only small file-like teeth. They swallow their catch whole, head-first. Billfish don't normally spear with their bills, though occasionally a marlin will flip a fish into the air and bayonet it. Given the speed and power of these fish, when they do spear things the results can be dramatic. Predators of billfish, such as great white and mako sharks, have been found with billfish spears embedded in them. Pelagic fish generally are fascinated by floating objects, and congregate about them. Billfish can accidentally impale boats and other floating objects when they pursue the small fish that aggregate around them. Care is needed when attempting to land a hooked billfish. Many fisherman have been injured, some seriously, by a billfish thrashing its bill about.\n\nBillfish are large swift predators which spend most of their time in the epipelagic zone of the open ocean. They feed voraciously on smaller pelagic fish, crustaceans and small squid. Some billfish species also hunt demersal fish on the seafloor, while others descend periodically to mesopelagic depths. They may come closer to the coast when they spawn in the summer. Their eggs and larvae are pelagic, that is they float freely in the water column. Many grow over three metres (10 feet) long, and the blue marlin can grow to five metres (16 feet). Females are usually larger than males.\n\nLike scombroids (tuna, bonito and mackerel), billfish have both the ability to migrate over long distances, efficiently cruising at slow speeds, and the ability to generate rapid bursts of speed. These speed bursts can be quite astonishing, and the Indo-Pacific sailfish has been recorded making a burst of 68 miles per hour (110 km/h), nearly top speed for a cheetah and the highest speed ever recorded for a fish.\n\nSome billfish also descend to considerable mesopelagic depths. They have sophisticated swim bladders which allow them to rapidly compensate for pressure changes as the depth changes. This means that when they are swimming deep, they can return swiftly to the surface without problems. \"Like the large tuna, some billfish maintain their body temperature several degrees above ambient water temperatures; this elevated body temperature increases the efficiency of the swimming muscles, especially during excursions into the cold water below the thermocline.\"\n\nIn 1936 the British zoologist James Gray posed a conundrum which has come to be known as Gray's paradox. The problem he posed was how dolphins can swim and accelerate so fast when it seemed their muscles lacked the needed power. If this is a problem with dolphins it is an even greater problem with billfish such as swordfish, which swim and accelerate faster than dolphins. In 2009, Taiwanese researchers from the National Chung Hsing University introduced new concepts of \"kidnapped airfoils and circulating horsepower\" to explain the swimming capabilities of swordfish. The researchers claim this analysis also \"solves the perplexity of dolphin's Gray paradox\". They also assert that swordfish \"use sensitive rostrum/lateral-line sensors to detect upcoming/ambient water pressure and attain the best attack angle to capture the body lift power aided by the forward-biased dorsal fin to compensate for most of the water resistance power.\"\n\nBillfish have prominent dorsal fins. Like tuna, mackerel and other scombroids, billfish streamline themselves by retracting their dorsal fins into a groove in their body when they swim. The shape, size, position and colour of the dorsal fin varies with the type of billfish, and can be a simple way to identify a billfish species. For example, the white marlin has a dorsal fin with a curved front edge and is covered with black spots. The huge dorsal fin, or sail of the sailfish is kept retracted most of the time. Sailfish raise them if they want to herd a school of small fish, and also after periods of high activity, presumably to cool down.\n\nBillfish occur worldwide in temperate and tropical waters. They are highly migratory oceanic fish, spending much of their time in the epipelagic zone of international water following major ocean currents. Migrations are linked to seasonal patterns of sea surface temperatures. They are sometimes referred to as \"rare event species\" because the areas they roam over in the open seas are so large that researchers have difficulty locating them. Little is known about their movements and life histories, so assessing how they can be sustainably managed is not easy.\n\nUnlike coastal fish, billfish usually avoid inshore waters unless there is a deep dropoff close to the land. Instead, they swim along the edge of the continental shelf where cold nutrient rich upwellings can fuel large schools of forage fish. Billfish can be found here, cruising and feeding \"above the craggy bottom like hawks soaring along a ridge line\".\n\nIn parts of the Pacific and Indian ocean such as the Maldives, billfishing, particularly for swordfish, is an important component of subsistence fishing.\n\nBillfish are among the most coveted of big gamefish, and major recreational fisheries cater to the demand. In North America, \"the apex of the salt water pursuits is billfishing, the quest for elusive blue marlin and sailfish in the deep blue water about 60 miles out.\" A lot of resources are committed to the activity, particularly in the construction of private and charter billfishing boats to participate in the billfishing tournament circuit. These are expensive purpose-built offshore vessels with powerfully driven deep sea hulls. They are often built to luxury standards and equipped with many technologies to ease the life of the deep sea recreational fisherman, including outriggers, flying bridges and fighting chairs, and state of the art fishfinders and navigation electronics.\n\nThe boats cruise along the edge of the continental shelf where billfish can be found down to 200 metres (600 ft), sometimes near weed lines at the surface and submarine canyons and ridges deeper down. Commercial fishermen usually use drift nets or longlines to catch billfish, but recreational fishermen usually drift with bait fish or troll a bait or lure. Billfish are caught deeper down the water column by drifting with live bait fish such as ballyhoo, striped mullet or bonito. Alternatively, they can be caught by trolling at the surface with dead bait or trolling lures designed to imitate bait fish.\n\nMost recreational fishermen now tag and release billfish. A 2003 study surveyed 317,000 billfish known to have been tagged and released since 1954. Of these, 4122 were recovered. The study concluded that, while tag and release programs have limitations, they provided important information about billfish that cannot currently be obtained by other methods.\n\nBillfish make good eating fish, and are high in omega-3 oils. Blue marlin has a particularly high oil content. However, because billfish have high trophic levels, near the top of the food web, they also contain significant levels of mercury and other toxins. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration, swordfish is one of four fishes, along with tilefish, shark, and king mackerel, that children and pregnant women should avoid due to high levels of methylmercury found in these fish and the consequent risk of mercury poisoning.\n\nBillfish are primarily marketed in Japan, where they are eaten raw as sashimi. They are marketed fresh, frozen, canned, cooked and smoked. It is not usually a good idea to fry billfish. Swordfish and marlin are best grilled or broiled, or eaten raw as in sashimi. Sailfish and spearfish are somewhat tough and are better cooked over charcoal or smoked.\n\nBillfish are exploited both as food and as fish. Marlin and sailfish are eaten in many parts of the world, and many sport fisheries target these species. Swordfish are subject to particularly intense fisheries pressures, and although their survival is not threatened worldwide, they are now comparatively rare in many places where once they were abundant. The istiophorid billfishes (marlin and spearfish) also suffer from intense fishing pressures. High mortality levels occur when they are caught incidentally by longline fisheries targeting other fish. Overfishing continues to \"push these declines further in some species\". Because of these concerns about declining populations, sport fishermen and conservationists now work together to gather information on billfish stocks and implement programs such as catch and release, where fish are returned to the sea after they have been caught. However, the process of catching them can leave them too traumatised to recover. Studies have shown that circle fishing hooks do much less damage to billfish than the traditional J-hooks, yet they are at just as effective for catching billfish. This is good for conservation, since it improves survival rates after release.\n\nThe stocks for individual species in billfish longline fisheries can \"boom and bust\" in linked and compensatory ways. For example, the Atlantic catch of blue marlin declined in the 1960s. This was accompanied by an increase in sailfish catch. The sailfish catch then declined from the end of the 1970s to the end of the 1980s, compensated by an increase in swordfish catch. As a result, overall billfish catches remained fairly stable.\n\n\"Many of the world's fisheries operate in a data poor environment that precludes predictions about how different management actions will affect individual species and the ecosystem as a whole.\" In recently years pop-up satellite archival tags have been used to monitor billfish. The capability of these tags to recover useful data is improving, and their use should result in more accurate stock assessments. In 2011, a group of researchers claimed they have, for the first time, standardized all available data about scombrids and billfishes so it is in a form suitable for assessing threats to these species. The synthesis shows that those species which combine a long life with a high economic value, such as the Atlantic blue marlin and the white marlin, are generally threatened. The combination puts such species in \"double jeopardy\".\n\n\n\n"}

AD 222) was an Anatolian Roman noblewoman. She was briefly married to the Roman emperor Elagabalus in 221 and thus a Roman empress. She was Elagabalus' third wife.\n\nAnnia Aurelia Faustina is an ancient Roman noblewoman who has been scarcely noticed by ancient and modern Roman historians. She was of noble descent, daughter and only child of the wealthy heiress Annia Faustina and the Roman Senator, consul Tiberius Claudius Severus Proculus. Her parents were maternal second-cousins.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were the Pontian Greek Roman Senator and Peripatetic Philosopher, Gnaeus Claudius Severus and his second wife, the Roman Princess Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina. Her maternal grandparents were wealthy Roman heiress Ummidia Cornificia Faustina and an unnamed Roman Senator. Her paternal half-uncle was Marcus Claudius Ummidius Quadratus, who had been adopted by the Roman Consul Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus, the nephew of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. She was a Roman citizen of Pontic Greek and Italian ancestry.\n\nHer paternal great-grandparents were the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius; Roman Empress Faustina the Younger; the Roman Senator, Philosopher Gnaeus Claudius Severus Arabianus and his unnamed wife. Her maternal great-grandparents were Marcus Aurelius’ sister, the noblewoman Annia Cornificia Faustina and Gaius Ummidius Quadratus Annianus Verus a Roman Senator who served as a suffect consul in 146. Thus she was a descendant of the former ruling Nerva–Antonine dynasty of the Roman Empire. Although by birth, Annia Aurelia Faustina was of the gens Claudia, she was not named after her father; instead she was named in honor of her parent’s relations to the gens Aurelia, the gens Annia and the Nerva–Antonine dynasty.\n\nAnnia Aurelia Faustina was born and raised on her mother's estate in Pisidia, one of a number in that area called the \"Cyllanian Estates\". These estates were very large properties, established from the time of the dictator of the Roman Republic, Lucius Cornelius Sulla (c. 138-78 BC).\n\nAbout 216, her father may have made a political alliance with a Roman Senator who was a member of the gens Pomponia that resulted in her marrying Pomponius Bassus.\n\nUpon her marriage, they settled at her Pisidian estates. Pomponius treated Annia well and they both lived in domestic tranquility. She bore at least two known children during her marriage: a daughter, Pomponia Ummidia (born 219), and a son, Pomponius Bassus (born 220).\n\nBy 218, her parents had died and Annia inherited her mother's estate and their fortune, becoming a very wealthy heiress. On the site of the estate inscriptions have survived proclaiming her inheritance of the property from her parents and that she was its owner.\n\nIn the year 221, Roman Emperor Elagabalus was induced to end his highly controversial and politically damaging marriage to the Vestal Virgin Aquilia Severa by powerful courtiers, led by his grandmother Julia Maesa. In its place he was advised to marry Annia Aurelia Faustina as an alliance with the powerful clan represented by her blood connections with the prior Nerva–Antonine dynasty. Annia Aurelia Faustina was recently widowed as her late husband, Pomponius Bassus, had been executed for subversion and treason. The senatorial Roman ruling class was more receptive of this imperial marriage than the previous one.\n\nAnnia became Empress of Rome and it seemed for a time that the Nerva–Antonine dynasty rule had returned to Rome. Elagabalus gave her the title of \"Augusta\". Supporters of\nElagabalus had hoped that Annia, the mother of two small children would bear him a natural heir however, she bore him no children. In the end of 221, Elagabalus, reasserting his previous course of action, divorced her and returned to Julia Aquilia Severa, remarrying her as his fourth wife. Due to her second brief marriage, there are no surviving sources describing Annia Aurelia Faustina's rule as a Roman empress.\n\nWhen her marriage to Elagabalus ended, Annia Aurelia Faustina returned with her children to the Pisidian estate. She spent the final years of her life there. When she died, her daughter Pomponia Ummidia inherited the estate, and her descendants had become various distinguished nobles and politicians in Roman Society.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2201240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201240", "title": "Shashanka", "text": "Shashanka\n\nShashanka (IAST: Śaśānka-deva) was the first independent king of a unified polity in the Bengal region, called the Gauda Kingdom and is a major figure in Bengali history. He reigned in 7th century AD, some historians place his rule between circa 600 C.E and 636/7 C.E. Whereas other sources place his reign between 590 and 625 C.E.\n\nHe is the contemporary of Harsha and of Bhaskaravarman of Kamarupa. His capital was at Karnasubarna, in present-day Murshidabad in West Bengal. The development of the Bengali calendar is often attributed to Shashanka because the starting date falls within his reign.\n\nThere are several major contemporary sources of information on his life, including copperplates from his vassal Madhavavarma (king of Ganjam), copperplates of his rivals Harsha and Bhaskaravarman, the accounts of Banabhatta, who was a bard in the court of Harsha, and of the Chinese monk Xuanzang, and also coins minted in Shashanka's reign.\n\nNot much is known about the early life of Shashanka. Historian D K Ganguly is reported to have concluded that he was a native of Magadha.\n\nThe same source reports that the historian Padmanath Bhattacharya took Shashanka to be a son of Mahasenagupta. R D Banerji concluded that he was descended from the Magadha Guptas. These views are opposed by other historians like B. S. Sinha and John Middleton, citing lack of evidence.\n\nNagendranath Basu has argued that Shashanka was the son / descendant of Raja Karnadeva, who founded the city of Karnasubarna.\n\nIn some sources, Shashanka is described as a tribal leader.\n\nShashanka's name appears in multiple forms, including Śaśānka and Śaśānka-deva. The name is derived from Sanskrit, as another name for the Moon. Śaśānka-deva therefore loosely translates to Moon god. The Hindu god Shiva is also known as \"Shashank Sekhar\" as He holds the moon on his head.\n\nThe Chinese monk Xuanzang's writings, he is mentioned as She-Shang-Kia. He is also called Śaśānka Narendragupta, which initially lent credence to the claim that he was descended from the later Guptas. In Sinha's Dynastic History of Magadha, the names 'Śaśānka' and 'Soma' are used interchangeably.\n\nThe Gupta Empire saw a series of weak kings after the death of Skandagupta in 467 C.E. On top of that, starting circa 480 C.E. Alchon Hun armies began attacking the declining empire from multiple sides. Defence of the vast empire put a strain on the royal treasury. Though the Huns were initially driven out, the protracted invasions quickened the downfall of the Gupta kings. It may be noted that Indian archeologist Shanker Sharma has argued that the empire's end was precipitated by a massive deluge around the middle of the sixth century C.E.\n\nNear the end of the sixth century, the empire was ruled over by a feeble ruler belonging to the Later Gupta dynasty, Mahasenagupta (r. c. 562-601 C.E.). The decline of the Gupta empire had left the disintegrating empire in chaos. Numerous local kings and rulers like Yashodharman emerged, and started vying for control of the many pieces of the former empire. Shashanka emerged as one of these ambitious local rulers, aiming to seize control of Gauda and its surrounding region.\nThe first mention of Shashanka is found in the 7th century hill fort Rohtasgarh in the small town of Rohtas in the kingdom of Magadha. The seal bore a curt inscription, \"Mahasamanta Shashankadeva.\"\n\nSome historians believe that Shashanka began his career as a feudatory chief (maha samanta) under Mahasenagupta, of the Later Gupta Dynasty. And that after the death of Mahasenagupta, Shashanka drove the later Guptas and other prominent nobles out of the region and established his own kingdom with his capital at Karnasubarna. Other historians like Sailendra Nath Sen is of the opinion that Mahasenagupta - already under pressure from the Maukharis (for failing to provide adequate protection) - wouldn't have knowingly appointed Shashanka to such an important position. Middleton (2015) argues in a similar vein that Shashanka served as \"maha samanta\" to a Gauda king, possibly Jayanaga.\n\nWhether Shashanka was a feudatory under the Maukharis or the Guptas is not known. By 605 C.E. following Mahasenagupta's death, Shashanka had established what became known as the Gauda Kingdom. From there, he issued gold coins to celebrate his triumph, and came to be addressed as \"Maharajadhiraja\" (king of great kings).\n\nNot many historical references to the Gauda Army are available. Like its predecessor, the Late Gupta army, Shashanka's army had infantry and cavalry units. D. C. Sircar (1990) reports that the Gauda army also fielded a strong elephant corps in Kamarupa.\n\nKamarupa king Bhaskaravarman describes the Gauda army as fielding a strong naval force.\n\nIt appears that between 595-600 C.E. the Gauda army had carried out attacks against the Varman King of Kamrupa (Assam). The Varman king died early in the war, and his two sons stepped up. The Doobi Copper Plate inscriptions tell us that the Gauda army fought and defeated the king, and princes Supratisthita and Bhaskara of Kamrupa. The princes are described as fighting a mighty elephantry force.\n\nThe princes were brought back to Gauda as prisoners, but released shortly thereafter. They supposedly returned to their kingdom as feudatories under Shashanka. The younger of the two would soon turn against the Gauda.\n\nHans Bakker argues that the army that set out to attack the Maukharis in Kanyakubja was more of a \"confederation of all those who held a grudge\", and that it was led by Shashanka.\n\nNow because the ruling dynasties of Kanyakubja and Sthaniswara were related by matrimony, Thanesar king Rajyavardhana immediately set out with 10,000 cavalrymen to recapture Kanyakubja and avenge his sister Rajyashri. Rajyavardhana fought and killed Devagupta on the way. As he continued towards Kanyakubja, he came across Shashanka's army. Circa 606 C.E. Rajyavardhana was killed by Shashanka. No conclusive evidence exists but it is possible that Shashanka, who joined the battle as an ally of Devagupta, murdered him. The only source available in this matter is the \"Harshacharita\" by Bāṇabhaṭṭa, who was a childhood friend and constant companion of Harsha; neither of these men were present at the death.\n\nHarsha succeeded his brother as ruler of Thanesar in 606 C.E. and he once again gathered the army and attacked Kannauj. Shashanka and his allies fought a major war with the then emperor of Thanesar, Harsha, and his allies. It is evident that Shashanka had to retreat from Kannauj. The result of the battle was inconclusive as Shashanka is documented to have retained dominion over his lands. Shashanka continued to rule Gauda with frequent attacks from Harsha, which he is known to have faced bravely.\n\nShashanka first established himself in Gauda, and set his eyes on Magadha. Magadha at that time was under Maukhari rule, and Shashanka vowed to free it again.\n\nSen (1977) has shown that none other than Shashanka could have defeated the Maukhari rulers of Magadha. Next,\nhe focused on extending his kingdom to Odissa, parts of Central Provinces, and Bihar.\n\nThough Shashanka remains known, and referred to, as the Lord of Gauda, his kingdom included more than just that region. By the end of his reign, his domain stretched from Vanga to Bhuvanesha while in the east, his kingdom bordered Kamarupa.\n\nAt its peak, Shashanka's kingdom and conquests included the following small kingdoms, provinces, principalities and feudatory estates (in alphabetical order): \n\nWhether all of the above came into the folds of the kingdom during Shashanka's lifetime, is not known. Also, while Shashanka is known to have occupied both Kamrupa and Kanyakubja, he could/did not hold on to either for long. Some historians maintain that Shashanka annexed Jharkhand as well.\n\nShashanka, at first glance, appears like a \"warlike monarch.\" His endless invasions and conquests tell of a king intent upon growing his kingdom. Sen describes Shashanka as a 'military adventurer', not unlike Yasodharman. But for a pre-medieval Indian king, endless battles, regicide, revenge and intrigue are not uncommon.\n\nLike many pre-medieval Indian kings, Shashanka is said to have grasped the importance of consolidating his position. He formed astute political alliances, notably with the Malva king, Devagupta, to counteract the combined might of the Kanauj-Thaneshwar coalition.\n\nAs king, Shashanka continued many Gupta-era traditions, e.g. making land grants to Brahmins, as evidenced by the copperplate inscriptions from the era. Gold and silver coins, known as Dinars, issued by Shashanka have also been discovered. He vigorously propagated Hinduism, and had Sakadvipi Brahmins and Vedic Brahmins invited into his kingdom, presumably from Kanyakubja, among other places.\n\nKing Shashanka is said to have built temples to Shiva in his kingdom. The famous Lingaraja Temple of Odisha is said to be commissioned by the same king, and became the first Shiva temple in the kingdom.\n\nHistorians argue that the unique Gauda style of composition developed with the development of poetry in the courts of the princes of Bengal. These princes of Bengal are none other than the Lords of Gauda.\n\nThree copperplate inscriptions issued by King Shashanka have been discovered. Two of these were issued in his 8th and 10th regnal years, and discovered from Midnapore. The other, known as the Egra Copperplate, was discovered near Kharagpur and bears no date.\n\nA 12th century text states that Shashanka destroyed the Buddhist stupas of Bengal and was an oppressor of Buddhism. Shashanka is reputed to have cut the Bodhi tree where the Buddha found enlightenment, in the Mahabodhi Temple of Bodh Gaya.\n\nRamesh Chandra Majumdar states that this account is doubtful because it was written centuries after the alleged persecution, and that it is \"unsafe to accept the statements recorded in this book as historical\". Radhagovinda Basak states that there is no reason to believe that this 12th century Buddhist author had cherished any ill feeling about Shashanka, and he may have had reasons to describe the events as they occurred in the 7th century.\n\nFollowing his death, Shashanka was succeeded by his son, Manava, who ruled the kingdom for eight months. However Gauda was soon divided amongst Harsha and Bhaskaravarman of Kamarupa, the latter even managing to conquer Karnasuvarna.\n\nSasanka was the first fully sovereign ruler of Bengal, and he occupies a prominent place in its history and collective memory. Shashanka's legacy is closely related to that of the kingdom that he founded, and the kingdom that rose and fell with him. But its legacy continued, leading later kings and sultans to accept Gauda's political demarcation. Later rulers built their edifices and monuments on older sites, and Pala kings even retained Shashanka's unique title of \"Gaureshwara\" (the lord of Gauda) for themselves.\n\nCommenting on the symbolism of Gauda, Akshay Kumar Maitreya remarked, “The whole of Gaur was once known as Gaura Desh. The Bengali language only a few days ago was known as Gauriya Basha… Even now in many parts of India Bengalis are known as Gauriya. So if one attempts to write our history, one must begin with Gaur.”\nKing Shashanka's unification, and subsequent defence, of local, disparate kingdoms including Vanga, Samatata and Gauda, against the mighty king Harsha, is considered seminal in the formation of the idea, and the polity, of Bengal. Many historians and commentators argue that Shashanka was the first independent king of not only Gauda, but of Bengal. As such he is a symbolic figure in the region's aspirations for independence and self-rule.\n\nShashanka's feat in bringing the many tribes and kingdoms under a single flag becomes clear only after his death. Chaos broke out in Bengal with the demise of the Gauda Kingdom. In Pala inscriptions, this time is called Matsyanyayam, implying times of 'jungle rule' when big fish swallow up small fish. \nIt is thought that the development of the Bengali calendar took place under Shashanka's reign.\n\nSituated in present-day Midnapore, Sarasanka is a massive \"dighi\" (manmade lake) measuring over 140 acres. That is nearly equal to the total area of 80 football fields. Its aesthetics show clear influences of the Hindu Vastu Shastra school of architecture, design and aesthetics.\n\nAccording to Bengali folk lore and legends, the \"dighi\" was excavated at the behest of King Shashanka. In one oral tradition: once Shashanka had been accompanying his mother to holy pilgrimage and his convoy camped at the small village of Jamuapati in Datan. There, his mother was impressed by local hospitality; she asked them why their yields were so meagre. The villagers replied that they suffered from an acute shortage of water.\n\nSo Shashank's mother urged her son to do something for the villagers, so that they still had water during the lean season. Not one to disobey his mother's wishes, Shashanka reportedly pulled out an arrow from his sheath, and announced that he would excavate a reservoir as long as the arrow's trajectory. And thus, over a period of three years, and with help from local nobles, Sarasanka came into existence.\n\nPublished in 1914, Shashanka is a historical novel penned by the famous Indian archaeologist Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay, who is best known for his discoveries in Mohenjo Daro. He found Shashanka to be a potent symbol of Bengal's glorious past and future political aspirations.\n\n\n"}

It is inversely proportional to the negative acceleration: a high number indicates a low negative acceleration—the drag on the body is small in proportion to its mass. BC can be expressed with the units kilogram per square meter (kg/m) or mass pound per square inch (lbs/in) (where 1 lbs/in corresponds to 703.069581 kg/m).\n\nWhere:\n\nThe formula for calculating the ballistic coefficient for small and large arms projectiles \"only\" is as follows:\n\nWhere:\n\nThe Coefficient of form (\"i\") can be derived by 6 methods and applied differently depending on the trajectory models used: G Model, Beugless/Coxe; 3 Sky Screen; 4 Sky Screen; Target Zeroing; Doppler radar.\n\nHere are several methods to compute i or C:\n\nWhere:\n\nor\n\nA drag coefficient can also be calculated mathematically: \n\nWhere:\n\nor\n\nFrom standard physics as applied to “G” models:\n\nWhere:\n\nThis formula is for calculating the ballistic coefficient within the small arms shooting community, but is redundant with BC:\n\nWhere:\n\nIn 1537, Niccolò Tartaglia performed test firing to determine the maximum angle and range for a shot. His conclusion was near 45 degrees. He noted that the shot trajectory was continuously curved.\n\nIn 1636, Galileo Galilei published results in \"Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences\". He found that a falling body had a constant acceleration. This allowed Galileo to show that a bullet's trajectory was a curve.\n\nCirca 1665, Sir Isaac Newton derived the law of air resistance. Newton's experiments on drag were through air and fluids. He showed that drag on shot increases proportionately with the density of the air (or the fluid), cross sectional area, and the square of the speed. Newton's experiments were only at low velocities to about .\n\nIn 1718, John Keill challenged the Continental Mathematica, \"\"To find the curve that a projectile may describe in the air, on behalf of the simplest assumption of gravity, and the density of the medium uniform, on the other hand, in the duplicate ratio of the velocity of the resistance\"\". This challenge supposes that air resistance increases exponentially to the velocity of a projectile. Keill gave no solution for his challenge. Johann Bernoulli took up this challenge and soon thereafter solved the problem and air resistance varied as \"any power\" of velocity; known as the Bernoulli equation. This is the precursor to the concept of the \"standard projectile\".\n\nIn 1742, Benjamin Robins invented the ballistic pendulum. This was a simple mechanical device that could measure a projectile's velocity. Robins reported muzzle velocities ranging from to . In his book published that same year \"New Principles of Gunnery\", he uses numerical integration from Euler's method and found that air resistance varies as the square of the velocity, but insisted that it changes at the speed of sound.\n\nIn 1753, Leonhard Euler showed how a theoretical trajectories might be calculated using his method as applied to the Bernoulli equation, but only for resistance varying as the square of the velocity.\n\nIn 1844, the Electro-ballistic chronograph was invented and by 1867 the electro-ballistic chronograph was accurate to within one ten millionth of a second.\n\nMany countries and their militaries carried out test firings from the mid eighteenth century on using large ordnance to determine the drag characteristics of each individual projectile. These individual test firings were logged and reported in extensive ballistics tables.\n\nOf the test firing, most notably were: Francis Bashforth at Woolwich Marshes & Shoeburyness, England (1864-1889) with velocities to and M. Krupp (1865–1880) of Friedrich Krupp AG at Meppen, Germany, Friedrich Krupp AG continued these test firings to 1930; to a lesser extent General Nikolai V. Mayevski, then a Colonel (1868–1869) at St. Petersburg, Russia; the Commission d'Experience de Gâvre (1873 to 1889) at Le Gâvre, France with velocities to and The British Royal Artillery (1904–1906).\n\nThe test projectiles (shot) used, vary from spherical, spheroidal, ogival; being hollow, solid and cored in design with the elongated ogival-headed projectiles having 1, 1½, 2 and 3 caliber radii. These projectiles varied in size from, at to at \n\nMany militaries up until the 1860s used calculus to compute projectile trajectory. The numerical computations necessary to calculate just a single trajectory was lengthy, tedious and done by hand. So, investigations to develop a theoretical drag model began. The investigations led to a major simplification in the experimental treatment of drag. This was the concept of a \"standard projectile\". The ballistic tables are made up for a factitious projectile being defined as: \"a factitious weight and with a specific shape and specific dimensions in a ratio of calibers.\" This simplifies calculation for the ballistic coefficient of a standard model projectile, which could mathematically move through the standard atmosphere with the same ability as any actual projectile could move through the actual atmosphere.\n\nIn 1870, Bashforth publishes a report containing his ballistic tables. Bashforth found that the drag of his test projectiles varied with the square of velocity (v) from to and with the cube of velocity (v) from to . As of his 1880 report, he found that drag varied by v from to . Bashforth used rifled guns of , , and ; smooth-bore guns of similar caliber for firing spherical shot and howitzers propelled elongated projectiles having an ogival-head of 1½ caliber radius.\n\nBashforth uses \"b\" as the variable for ballistic coefficient. When \"b\" is equal to or less than v, then \"b\" is equal to \"P\" for the drag of a projectile. It would be found that air does not deflect off the front of a projectile in the same direction, when there are of differing shapes. This prompted the introduction of a second factor to \"b\", the coefficient of form (\"i\"). This is particularly true at high velocities, greater than . Hence, Bashforth introduced the \"undetermined multiplier\" of any power called the formula_11 factor that compensate for this unknown effects of drag above ; formula_12. Bashforth then integrated formula_11 and formula_14 as formula_15.\n\nAlthough Bashforth did not conceive the \"restricted zone\", he showed mathematically there were 5 restricted zones. Bashforth did not propose a standard projectile, but was well aware of the concept.\n\nIn 1872, Mayevski published his report \"Trité Balistique Extérieure\", which included the Mayevski model. Using his ballistic tables along with Bashforth's tables from the 1870 report, Mayevski created an analytical math formula that calculated the air resistances of a projectile in terms of log A and the value \"n\". Although Mayevski's math used a differing approach than Bashforth, the resulting calculation of air resistance was the same. Mayevski proposed the restricted zone concept and found there to be six restricted zones for projectiles.\n\nCirca 1886, Mayevski published the results from a discussion of experiments made by M. Krupp (1880). Though the ogival-headed projectiles used varied greatly in caliber, they had essentially the same proportions as the standard projectile, being mostly 3 caliber in length, with an ogive of 2 calibers radius. Giving the standard projectile dimensionally as and .\n\nIn 1880, Colonel Francesco Siacci published his work \"Balistica\". Siacci found as did those who came before him that the resistance and density of the air becomes greater and greater as a projectile displaced the air at higher and higher velocities.\n\nSiacci's method was for flat-fire trajectories with angles of departure of less than 20 degrees. He found that the angle of departure is sufficiently small to allow for air density to remain the same and was able to reduce the ballistics tables to easily tabulated quadrants giving distance, time, inclination and altitude of the projectile. Using Bashforth's \"k\" and Mayevski's tables, Siacci created a four-zone model. Siacci used Mayevski's standard projectile. From this method and standard projectile, Siacci formulated a shortcut.\n\nSiacci found that within a low-velocity restricted zone, projectiles of similar shape, and velocity in the same air density behave similarly; formula_16 or formula_17. Siacci used the variable formula_18 for ballistic coefficient. Meaning, air density is the generally the same for flat-fire trajectories, thus sectional density is equal to the ballistic coefficient and air density can be dropped. Then as the velocity rises to Bashforth's formula_11 for high velocity when formula_18 requires the introduction of formula_14. Following within today's currently used ballistic trajectory tables for an average ballistic coefficient: formula_22 would equal formula_23 equals formula_24 as formula_25.\n\nSiacci wrote that within any restricted zone, \"C\" being the same for two or more projectiles, the trajectories differences will be minor. Therefore, \"C\" agrees with an average curve, and this average curve applies for all projectiles. Therefore, a single trajectory can be computed for the standard projectile without having to resort to tedious calculus methods, and then a trajectory for any actual bullet with known \"C\" can be computed from the standard trajectory with just simple algebra.\n\nThe aforementioned ballistics tables are generally: functions, air density, projectile time at range, range, degree of projectile departure, weight and diameter to facilitate the calculation of ballistic formulae. These formulae produce the projectile velocity at range, drag and trajectories. The modern day commercially published ballistic tables or software computed ballistics tables for small arms, sporting ammunition are exterior ballistic, trajectory tables.\n\nThe 1870 Bashforth tables were to . Mayevski, using his tables, supplemented by the Bashforth tables (to 6 restricted zones) and the Krupp tables. Mayevski conceived a 7th restricted zone and extended the Bashforth tables to . Mayevski converted Bashforth's data from Imperial units of measure to metric units of measure (now in SI units of measure). In 1884, James Ingalls published his tables in the U.S. Army Artillery Circular M using the Mayevski tables. Ingalls extended Mayevski's ballistics tables to within an 8th restricted zone, but still with the same \"n\" value (1.55) as Mayevski's 7th restricted zone. Ingalls, converted Mayevski's results back to Imperial units. The British Royal Artillery results were very similar to those of Mayevski's and extended their tables to within the 8th restricted zone changing the \"n\" value from 1.55 to 1.67. These ballistic tables were published in 1909 and almost identical to those of Ingalls. In 1971 the Sierra Bullet company calculated their ballistic tables to 9 restricted zones but only within .\n\nIn 1881, the Commission d'Experience de Gâvre did a comprehensive survey of data available from their tests as well as other countries. After adopting a standard atmospheric condition for the drag data the Gavre drag function was adopted. This drag function was known as the Gavre function and the standard projectile adopted was the Type 1 projectile. Thereafter, the Type 1 standard projectile was renamed by Ballistics Section of Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland, USA as G after the Commission d'Experience de Gâvre. For practical purposes the subscript 1 in G is generally written in normal font size as G1.\n\nThe general form for the calculations of trajectory adopted for the G model is the Siacci method. The standard model projectile is a \"fictitious projectile\" used as the mathematical basis for the calculation of actual projectile's trajectory when an initial velocity is known. The G1 model projectile adopted is in dimensionless measures of 2 caliber radius ogival-head and 3.28 caliber in length. By calculation this leaves the body length 1.96 caliber and head, 1.32 caliber long.\n\nOver the years there has been some confusion as to adopted size, weight and radius ogival-head of the G1 standard projectile. This misconception may be explained by Colonel Ingalls in the 1886 publication, Exterior Ballistics in the Plan Fire; page 15, \"In the following tables the first and second columns give the velocities and corresponding resistance, in pounds, to an elongated one inch in diameter and having an ogival head of one and a half calibers. They were deduced from Bashforth's experiments by Professor A. G. Greenhill, and are taken from his papers published in the Proceedings of the Royal Artillery Institution, No 2, Vol. XIII.\" Further it is discussed that said projectile's weight was one pound.\n\nFor the purposes of mathematical convenience for any standard projectile (G) the \"BC\" is 1.00. Where as the projectile's sectional density (SD) is dimensionless with a mass of 1 divided by the square of the diameter of 1 caliber equaling an SD of 1. Then the standard projectile is assigned a coefficient of form of 1. Following that formula_26. \"BC\", as a general rule, within flat-fire trajectory, is carried out to 2 decimal points. \"BC\" is commonly found within commercial publications to be carried out to 3 decimal points as few sporting, small arms projectiles rise to the level of 1.00 for a ballistic coefficient.\n\nWhen using the Siacci method for different G models, the formula used to compute the trajectories is the same. What differs is retardation factors found through testing of actual projectiles that are similar in shape to the standard project reference. This creates slightly different set of retardation factors between differing G models. When the correct G model retardation factors are applied within the Siacci mathematical formula for the same G model \"BC\", a corrected trajectory can be calculated for any G model.\n\nAnother method of determining trajectory and ballistic coefficient was developed and published by Wallace H. Coxe and Edgar Beugless of DuPont in 1936. This method is by shape comparison an logarithmic scale as drawn on 10 charts. The method estimates the ballistic coefficient related to the drag model of the Ingalls tables. When matching an actual projectile against the drawn caliber radii of Chart No. 1, it will provide \"i\" and by using Chart No. 2, \"C \"can be quickly calculated. Coxe and Beugless used the variable \"C\" for ballistic coefficient.\n\nThe Siacci method was abandoned by the end of the World War I for artillery fire. But the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps continued using the Siacci method into the middle of the 20th century for direct (flat-fire) tank gunnery. The development of the electromechanical analog computer contributed to the calculation of aerial bombing trajectories during World War II. After World War II the advent of the silicon semiconductor based digital computer made it possible to create trajectories for the guided missiles/bombs, intercontinental ballistic missiles and space vehicles.\n\nBetween World War I and II the U.S. Army Ballistics research laboratories at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Maryland, USA developed the standard models for G2, G5, G6. In 1965, Winchester Western published a set of ballistics tables for G1, G5, G6 and GL. In 1971 Sierra Bullet Company retested all their bullets and concluded that the G5 model was not the best model for their boat tail bullets and started using the G1 model. This was fortunate, as the entire commercial sporting and firearms industries had based their calculations on the G1 model. The G1 model and Mayevski/Siacci Method continue to be the industry standard today. This benefit allows for comparison of all ballistic tables for trajectory within the commercial sporting and firearms industry.\n\nIn recent years there have been vast advancements in the calculation of flat-fire trajectories with the advent of Doppler radar and the personal computer and handheld computing devices. Also, the newer methodology proposed by Dr. Arthur Pejsa and the use of the G7 model used by Mr. Bryan Litz, ballistic engineer for Berger Bullets, LLC for calculating boat tailed spitzer rifle bullet trajectories and 6 Dof model based software have improved the prediction of flat-fire trajectories.\n\nMost ballistic mathematical models and hence tables or software take for granted that one specific drag function correctly describes the drag and hence the flight characteristics of a bullet related to its ballistic coefficient. Those models do not differentiate between wadcutter, flat-based, spitzer, boat-tail, very-low-drag, etc. bullet types or shapes. They assume one invariable drag function as indicated by the published BC. Several different drag curve models optimized for several standard projectile shapes are available, however.\n\nThe resulting drag curve models for several standard projectile shapes or types are referred to as:\n\nSince these standard projectile shapes differ significantly the G\"x\" BC will also differ significantly from the G\"y\" BC for an identical bullet. To illustrate this the bullet manufacturer Berger has published the G1 and G7 BCs for most of their target, tactical, varmint and hunting bullets. Other bullet manufacturers like Lapua and Nosler also published the G1 and G7 BCs for most of their target bullets. How much a projectile deviates from the applied reference projectile is mathematically expressed by the form factor (\"i\"). The applied reference projectile shape always has a form factor (\"i\") of exactly 1. When a particular projectile has a sub 1 form factor (\"i\") this indicates that the particular projectile exhibits lower drag than the applied reference projectile shape. A form factor (\"i\") greater than 1 indicates the particular projectile exhibits more drag than the applied reference projectile shape. In general the G1 model yields comparatively high BC values and is often used by the sporting ammunition industry.\n\nVariations in BC claims for exactly the same projectiles can be explained by differences in the ambient air density used to compute specific values or differing range-speed measurements on which the stated G1 BC averages are based. Also, the BC changes during a projectile's flight, and stated BCs are always averages for particular range-speed regimes. Further explanation about the variable nature of a projectile's G1 BC during flight can be found at the external ballistics article. The external ballistics article implies that knowing how a BC was determined is almost as important as knowing the stated BC value itself.\n\nFor the precise establishment of BCs (or perhaps the scientifically better expressed drag coefficients), Doppler radar-measurements are required. The normal shooting or aerodynamics enthusiast, however, has no access to such expensive professional measurement devices. Weibel 1000e or Infinition BR-1001 Doppler radars are used by governments, professional ballisticians, defense forces, and a few ammunition manufacturers to obtain exact real-world data on the flight behavior of projectiles of interest.\n\nDoppler radar measurement results for a lathe turned monolithic solid .50 BMG very-low-drag bullet (Lost River J40 , monolithic solid bullet / twist rate 1:) look like this:\n\nThe initial rise in the BC value is attributed to a projectile's always present yaw and precession out of the bore. The test results were obtained from many shots, not just a single shot. The bullet was assigned 1.062 lbs/in (746.7 kg/m) for its BC number by the bullet's manufacturer, Lost River Ballistic Technologies.\n\nMeasurements on other bullets can give totally different results. How different speed regimes affect several 8.6 mm (.338 in calibre) rifle bullets made by the Finnish ammunition manufacturer Lapua can be seen in the .338 Lapua Magnum product brochure which states Doppler radar established BC data.\n\nSporting bullets, with a calibre \"d\" ranging from , have BCs in the range 0.12 lbs/in to slightly over 1.00 lbs/in (84 kg/m to 703 kg/m). Those bullets with the higher BCs are the most aerodynamic, and those with low BCs are the least. Very-low-drag bullets with BCs ≥ 1.10 lbs/in (over 773 kg/m) can be designed and produced on CNC precision lathes out of mono-metal rods, but they often have to be fired from custom made full bore rifles with special barrels.\n\nAmmunition makers often offer several bullet weights and types for a given cartridge. Heavy-for-caliber pointed (spitzer) bullets with a boattail design have BCs at the higher end of the normal range, whereas lighter bullets with square tails and blunt noses have lower BCs. The 6 mm and 6.5 mm cartridges are probably the most well known for having high BCs and are often used in long range target matches of – . The 6 and 6.5 have relatively light recoil compared to high BC bullets of greater caliber and tend to be shot by the winner in matches where accuracy is key. Examples include the 6mm PPC, 6mm Norma BR, 6x47mm SM, 6.5×55mm Swedish Mauser, 6.5×47mm Lapua, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5 Grendel, .260 Remington, and the 6.5-284. The 6.5 mm is also a popular hunting caliber in Europe.\n\nIn the United States, hunting cartridges such as the .25-06 Remington (a 6.35 mm caliber), the .270 Winchester (a 6.8 mm caliber), and the .284 Winchester (a 7 mm caliber) are used when high BCs and moderate recoil are desired. The .30-06 Springfield and .308 Winchester cartridges also offer several high-BC loads, although the bullet weights are on the heavy side.\n\nIn the larger caliber category, the .338 Lapua Magnum and the .50 BMG are popular with very high BC bullets for shooting beyond 1,000 meters. Newer chamberings in the larger caliber category are the .375 and .408 Cheyenne Tactical and the .416 Barrett.\n\nFor many years, bullet manufacturers were the main source of ballistic coefficients for use in trajectory calculations. However, in the past decade or so, it has been shown that ballistic coefficient measurements by independent parties can often be more accurate than manufacturer specifications. Since ballistic coefficients depend on the specific firearm and other conditions that vary, it is notable that methods have been developed for individual users to measure their own ballistic coefficients.\n\nSatellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with high ballistic coefficients experience smaller perturbations to their orbits due to atmospheric drag.\n\nThe ballistic coefficient of an atmospheric reentry vehicle has a significant effect on its behavior. A very high ballistic coefficient vehicle would lose velocity very slowly and would impact the Earth's surface at higher speeds. In contrast, a low ballistic coefficient would reach subsonic speeds before reaching the ground.\n\nIn general, reentry vehicles that carry human beings back to Earth from space have high drag and a correspondingly low ballistic coefficient. Vehicles that carry nuclear weapons launched by an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), by contrast, have a high ballistic coefficient, which enables them to travel rapidly from space to a target on land. That makes the weapon less affected by crosswinds or other weather phenomena, and harder to track, intercept, or otherwise defend against.\n\n\n"}

It is the fifth game in the \"Mega Man Battle Network\" series, and the first \"Mega Man\" game to be released on the Nintendo DS. \"Battle Network 5\" comes in three different versions: Team ProtoMan and Team Colonel, both for the Game Boy Advance, which have similar gameplay but slightly different supporting characters and stories, and Mega Man Battle Network 5: Double Team DS for the Nintendo DS, which includes the content from both games as well as extra content.\n\nGameplay in \"Mega Man Battle Network 5\" in this game is largely similar to that of its predecessors. The player explores the real world through Lan and the Net through MegaMan.EXE. When Lan plugs his PET, a handheld computer, into a computer with an interface jack, he can upload MegaMan.EXE to the cyber network, allowing him to explore and fight viruses as random encounters.\n\nWhen MegaMan.EXE encounters viruses, the screen shifts to a battle screen set on a six by three square grid. On the left half of the grid is MegaMan.EXE, and on the other half are his opponents. MegaMan.EXE has a relatively weak arm cannon, the Mega Buster, but his main weapon is Lan's library of battle chips, one-use-per-battle special attacks which grant various abilities, including simple attacks, attack enhancements, defensive effects, terrain transmogrification, or assistance from other NetNavis. Before battle, the player can construct a folder consisted of thirty battle chips, and each turn of a battle (measured by a timer bar at the top of the screen), the player is presented with a random selection of these chips. The player can send MegaMan.EXE m up to five battle chips, after which the battle takes place in real time, with MegaMan.EXE, controlled by the player, attacking with his Mega Buster, dodging attacks, or activating battle chips from his queue.\n\nMegaMan.EXE joins a team led by either Lan's and MegaMan.EXE's rivals Chaud and ProtoMan.EXE or new characters Baryl and Colonel.EXE, and the members of this team assist MegaMan in various ways. MegaMan.EXE can take on the attributes of one of his teammates with a Soul Unison. The team plays its largest role in Liberation missions, wherein MegaMan.EXE and the rest of his team enter a part of the Nebula-controlled Internet to free the area via a time-limited battle with a group of viruses. Also new to \"Mega Man Battle Network 5\" are \"Dark Chips\", which are more powerful Battle Chips. While they appeared randomly in \"Mega Man Battle Network 4\" when MegaMan.EXE was badly damaged, they act more like normal battle chips in this game in that they can be added to the battle chip folder like any other chip. Using Dark Chips has a downside: MegaMan.EXE will no longer be able to achieve Soul Unison, and every time MegaMan.EXE uses a Dark Chip, he permanently loses one point from his maximum hit points (HP). He can, however, use a Dark Chip for a Soul Unison; this is called a Chaos Unison, which resembles a normal Soul Unison with the main difference being that the Mega Buster is replaced with the effects of the Dark Chip he used for the Chaos Unison. While using this effect doesn't cause HP loss, it has to be done with careful timing, as charging with poor timing will end the Chaos Unison and cause an invincible, evil version of MegaMan.EXE to join the viruses and attack him for a short period of time using random battle chips. Much like previous games in the series, Game Boy Advance copies of \"Mega Man Battle Network 5\" can connect using the Game Boy Advance link cable to battle head-to-head or to trade battle chips.\n\nLan Hikari and his friends, Dex, Mayl and Yai, are called to the SciLab headquarters for the announcement of the latest research project that Lan's father, Yuichiro, has been working on. Before he can reveal it to them, mysterious agents take over SciLab, subduing everyone with sleeping gas, kidnapping Yuichiro, and stealing their PETs (a device that contains the program avatars called NetNetNavis). However, Lan was in a different section of the lab and avoids being discovered or having his PET stolen. The agents turn out to be working for Dr. Regal and his crime syndicate Nebula, which has returned after being defeated in \"Mega Man Battle Network 4\". Nebula subsequently takes over the Net with an army of viruses and Darkloids: NetNetNavis that use dark powers and Dark Chips.\n\nWhile investigating a disturbance at SciLab, Lan meets either Chaud (in \"Team ProtoMan\") or Baryl (in \"Team Colonel\"), who recruit him to begin forming an elite team of NetNetNavis to fight against Nebula's control. In a series of scenarios identical between games, Lan meets up with other powerful NetNetNavi operators and recruits them; Team ProtoMan grows to consist of Magnet Man, Gyro Man, Napalm Man, Search Man, and Meddy, while Team Colonel consists of Knight Man, Shadow Man, Tomahawk Man, Number Man, and Toad Man. Through the team's efforts, the Net is liberated area by area and peace gets restored. However, the occupation of the Net was a diversion by Nebula while they searched for \"The Hikari Report\", a research project by Lan's grandfather Dr. Hikari.\n\nStarting with a clue from an encrypted message on Yuichiro's lab computer, Lan and MegaMan.EXE discover digital snapshots of the real world in the past called VisionBursts which are hidden in the net. By piecing together clues left by Dr. Hikari in these areas, they discover he hid the Hikari Report in one of the VisionBursts, but Regal finds it first and claims it. The Hikari Report is explained to be a research project undertaken by Hikari and Dr. Wily to create SoulNet, an internet network connecting the minds and souls of humans and NetNetNavis across the world. The two believed SoulNet could bring peace and unity, but were unable to finish their research. Regal intends to unleash Nebula Grey, a program of pure hatred and darkness, upon the completed SoulNet, corrupting all humans and NetNetNavis in the world. Lan also discovers that Regal is Dr. Wily's son, and the two scientists intended for their children to complete their project.\n\nLan's team storms Nebula's base and battles through it until Lan confronts Regal in the SoulNet server room. MegaMan.EXE seals Nebula Grey and the room begins to self-destruct. While the heroes evacuate, Yuichiro stays behind to speak to Regal about the research of their fathers. He collapses as Regal rejects the idea that he could reform, and a voice calls out to him and orders SoulServer to overload. In \"Team ProtoMan\" the speaker is unseen, while in \"Team Colonel\" Dr. Wily enters the room and gives the command. Lan narrates that an unknown figure saved his father from the destruction of Nebula's base, and Yuichiro calls the group to SciLab to meet Dr. Regal, who has had many of his memories erased by SoulServer and is now a peaceful scientist. Lan's friends and NetNetNavis visit the VisionBurst of the ACDC Town of the past as Yuichiro speaks to Lan and MegaMan.EXE about the hope for another world passed down through the generations that they will one day carry with them.\n\nThe membership of the liberation squad differs between the two versions of \"Mega Man Battle Network 5\". Recruiting each member involves largely similar challenges and each character fills a certain role on the team, but the motivations and in-game abilities of each character are sometimes quite different.\n\nIn both games, the liberation team is led by an experienced official Netbattler, with a NetNavi with a sword for an arm. In \"Team ProtoMan\", the team is led by Electopian official Netbattler Chaud, Lan's recurring rival and operator of the swordsman NetNavi ProtoMan.EXE. His equivalent in \"Team Colonel\" is the new character Baryl, a Netopian official visiting Lan's home country of Electopia. Baryl is the operator of Colonel.EXE, a NetNavi who can adapt any chip to connect to his arm and adapt any object to fight as a soldier for him.\nThe first addition to the team is a NetNavi returning from \"Mega Man Battle Network 2\", one who can protect the rest of the team from attacks. This second operator is drilling in an abandoned mine on Oran Island, and unknowingly endangering Lan's vacationing friends. In \"Team ProtoMan\", it is Tesla Magnus, who has inherited MagnetMan.EXE from her Gospel agent father, Gauss Magnus. In \"Team Colonel\", it is Princess Pride, operator of KnightMan.EXE, who has turned over a new leaf since the events of \"Battle Network 2.\"\n\nThe leader of the liberation team then hires a free agent to join the team, but this free agent insists on testing Lan and MegaMan at length, forcing them to overcome a series of challenges. In \"Team ProtoMan\", this free agent is series newcomer Charlie Airstar, a Netopian helicopter pilot, and his agile NetNavi, GyroMan.EXE. In \"Team Colonel\", this is former Gospel agent (now revealed to be a mercenary) Dusk and his ninja-like NetNavi, ShadowMan.EXE.\n\nThe next member of the team is recruited when Lan foils his plot to steal Ubercorp's booster system, a system that amplifies a NetNavi's effectiveness a thousandfold, from aboard the cruise ship Queen Bohemia. In \"Team ProtoMan\", this is fireworks maker Fyrefox and former Solo-NetNavi NapalmMan.EXE, and in \"Team Colonel\" this is Netopian Native American Dingo, operator of TomahawkMan.EXE. Both of them get aboard the ship by being hired on to offer the passengers Netbattles for entertainment, but they have different motivations: Fyrefox wants to make more-spectacular fireworks, while Dingo wants revenge for the production of the booster system, which ruined the livelihoods of many in his home community.\n\nThe next member of the team is brought on to crack the security systems of Yuichiro's computer, in an effort to discover what he was working on when he was kidnapped. A wedge is initially driven between this member of the team when imposters from Nebula disguise themselves as MegaMan and this member's NetNavi fool them into thinking that the other is an agent of Nebula. Once they realize their error, they team up and defeat the Nebula imposters. In \"Team ProtoMan\", Lan and MegaMan are suspicious of the close-lipped nature of Sharo soldier Raika and his military-minded NetNavi SearchMan.EXE, while in \"Team Colonel\" they are suspicious of how desperate shopkeeper and Higsby, operator of NumberMan.EXE and former agent of the evil organization WWW, is to join the team.\n\nThe last member of the team forces herself onto the team, in order to accomplish her own goals. In doing so, however, she accidentally gets ProtoMan.EXE (or Colonel, depending on the version) captured and corrupted by Nebula, and the team must confront and rescue him. In \"Team ProtoMan\", this is series newcomer Jasmine, operator of medic-themed NetNavi Meddy.EXE, and she seeks to find a medical book hidden on the Undernet to cure her grandfather. In \"Team Colonel\", this is DNN reporter Ribitta, owner of ToadMan.EXE, and she seeks to deduce the identities of Team Colonel.\n\nThe fifth installation of the game was first advertised in Japanese magazine, \"Corocoro Comic\" in August 2004.\n\n\"Mega Man Battle Network 5: Team ProtoMan\" was the 48th best-selling game in Japan in 2004 at 255,061 copies. This version was also the 55th best-selling game in the country in 2005 at 211,099 copies. \"Mega Man Battle Network 5: Team Colonel\" placed at number 65 with 194,472 copies sold that year. \"Mega Man Battle Network 5: Double Team DS\" was the 52nd best-selling Nintendo DS game in Japan in 2005 at 106,526 copies.\n\nIn North America, both the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of \"Mega Man Battle Network 5\" met with fairly tepid critical reception, with Metacritic and GameRankings aggregate scores ranging from 66% to 70% across the different versions. Reviewers criticized the game for its lack of innovation over its predecessors, describing it as an \"incremental advancement,\" \"an old, whiffy GBA kids RPG,\" and \"just too darn much like its predecessors.\" Reviewers often highlighted the reuse of aging art and sound assets from previous games, comparing them unfavorably with contemporary Game Boy Advance games.\n\nReviews weren't entirely unfavorable, especially when the topic of \"Battle Network 5\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> predecessor was concerned. GameSpot, in particular, compared it favorably with \"Mega Man Battle Network 4\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2201268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201268", "title": "Twist per inch", "text": "Twist per inch\n\nTPI (twists per inch or turns per inch) is a term used in the textile industry. It measures how much twist a yarn has, and can be calculated by counting the number of twists in an inch of yarn.\n\nTwist is needed in yarn to hold the fibres together, and is added in the spinning and plying processes. The amount of twist varies depending on the fibre, thickness of yarn, preparation of fibre, manner of spinning, and the desired result. Fine wool and silk generally use more twist than coarse wool, short staples more than long, thin more than thick, and short drawn more than long drawn.\n\nThe amount of twist in a yarn helps to define the style of yarn – a yarn with a lot of air such as a woollen-spun yarn will have much less twist than a yarn with little air such as a worsted-spun yarn. The amount of twist also affects the yarn in terms of stretchiness, strength, halo, and many other attributes. Filling or weft yarns usually have fewer twists per inch because strength is not as important as with warp yarns, and highly twisted yarns are, in general, stronger. Warp yarns have to be stronger so that they can withstand the tension of the loom. Filament fibers, such as silk, or many synthetics, need only be twisted slightly to create a yarn.\n\nHandspinners use the number of twists per inch often. Because the amount of twist defines a lot about a yarn, the number of twists per inch is an important measure to recreate a yarn. As a spinner spins, they will often stop every few minutes to check to see that the number of twists per inch is the same throughout the yarn, as well as that the number of wraps per inch (the thickness of the yarn) is the same. Measuring the number of twists per inch while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists per inch tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists per inch, such as medium twist or hard twist yarns. Yarns that have a very hard twist, enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns.\n\nThe number of twists per inch can, in plied yarns, be determined by counting the number of bumps in one inch, and dividing that number by the number of singles (the strands plied together to make the yarn). If the adjacent picture, for example, was of an inch of two ply yarn, then the number of twists per inch would be 6 divided by 2, or three, as there are six bumps, and it is a two ply.\n\nWhile this method works well with plied yarns, singles don't have bumps to count. One way to determine the tpi for a single is to add a contrasting color fibre when spinning it, and then count the number of times the contrasting fibre has wrapped around the yarn. Another method is to measure an inch of yarn and untwist it, counting how many full revolutions it takes until there is no twist left. This can be done by inserting two paper-clips into the yarn, at an inch apart, thus making it easier to count a full revolution. A less precise method is to allow the single to ply against itself: the resulting two ply yarn is about half the number of twists per inch of the single. Thus one can roughly find the number of twists per inch for the single, or one can use the doubled back yarn as a measure.\n\nWith a thick-and-thin yarn, it is best to count the twist over several inches and average the results. This is because the number of twists per inch will tend to vary between the thin and thick sections.\n\nIn the industry the number of twists per inch is calculated as:\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere formula_2 is the Twist Multiplier, also known as formula_3 or the Twist Factor. This Twist Multiplier is an empirical parameter that has been established by experiments and practice that the maximum strength of a yarn is obtained for a definite value of K. In the case of ring spun cotton yarns, for example, the following values of K have been found to give the best results.\n"}

The group consists of Bronx-born Marty Cintron and twin brothers Ariel and Gabriel Hernández, who hailed from Miami.\n\nIn 1995 the group released their single \"Missing\" which was a cover version of Everything but the Girl's 1994 hit. No Mercy released their debut album \"My Promise\" on October 21, 1996. \"My Promise\" was the original title chosen by the trio's German record company, Hansa, BMG. The album was released in the U.S. only a week later under the self title \"No Mercy\" on October 29, 1996. The album, however, was released in most areas of the world with its original title \"My Promise\", including Australia where it received two times platinum sales accreditation. \"My Promise\" which became a top-5 album in countries like Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, produced two internationally popular singles, including \"Where Do You Go\" and \"When I Die\", the first being a cover of La Bouche's \"Where Do You Go\" from 1995. This was followed by the single \"Please Don't Go\", which entered the top 5 in Austria and the U.K. The trio released a re-worked version of the band Exile's number one song from 1978, \"Kiss You All Over\", which was a moderate success on the charts but still managed to enter the top 20 in Austria, the Netherlands and the UK.\n\nNo Mercy's second album, \"More\", which was released in Germany on October 12, 1998, included singles such as \"Hello How Are You\", \"More than a Feeling\" (originally recorded by Boston) and \"Tu Amor\" (originally by Jon B., and later covered also by RBD). Although \"More\" was not as successful as its predecessor, it still managed to achieve success in the GSA region (Germany, Switzerland, Austria), peaking at No.7, No.9, No.9 respectively.\n\nIn 2002, a single, \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\" featuring guitarist Al Di Meola, was released to gauge support for No Mercy's third album. The record producer decided instead to rework the songs for solo artist Daniel Lopes' debut album, \"Shine On\", in 2003. The band would guest feature in that album, on the track \"Summer Angel\".\n\nIn October 2007, No Mercy released their third album, \"Day By Day\", under a new Australian-based independent record label, Show No Mercy Entertainment Pty Ltd, and via iTunes.\n\nOn December 16, 2011 No Mercy released the single \"Shed My Skin\" featuring Stan Kolev via iTunes.\n\nNo Mercy's version of the La Bouche song \"Where Do You Go\" (Ocean Drive Mix) was featured in the 1998 American comedy film \"A Night at the Roxbury\".\n\nA No Mercy song was also used on the ABC-TV series \"Lois and Clark\".\n\n\n"}
