As Crystal Lake's second oldest school, it was constructed from 1976 to 1978 and opened in September 1978 after Crystal Lake Community High School, now Crystal Lake Central High School, split into two schools due to the pressures of the population growth in the communities it served, Crystal Lake, a part of Lake in the Hills and a small portion of Algonquin. South graduated its first class in 1979 - this class consisted of approximately 250 seniors who were transferred from Crystal Lake Central High School. South graduated its first class who attended all four years in 1982.\n\nAfter the community's school split, the South Gators and Central Tigers became rivals in the Fox Valley Conference. Though recently, focus of rivalry has primarily shifted to the Cary-Grove High School Trojans and the Prairie Ridge Wolves due to vastly increased competition in football games between the two schools. However, an underlying tone of competition still vibrates between the two Crystal Lake schools.\n\nThe city of Crystal Lake has grown rapidly since South first opened it doors. The school reached its structural capacity in 2002. A new addition opened for the 2003-2004 school year, with several dozen new classrooms. However, due to the phenomenal growth of the city, the addition was already insufficient by the 2005-2006 school year (the graduating class of 2004 consisted of 366 students, class of 2006 had 435 students, and the class of 2009 contained approximately 540 students). The final phase of the 2003-2004 additions was opened in the 2006-2007 school year. The \"Lower level\" under C-Hall added 10 classrooms and over 100 lockers.\n\nIn 2018, the Lower Level was renovated and reopened as a separate school, due to shrinking population in Crystal Lake.\n\nCrystal Lake South High School's mascot is the \"Gator\". This mascot was chosen in 1976 by a poll of students who would attend South when it first opened. Currently South is being sued by University of Florida (CLS allegedly used their logo without permission to sell it on merchandise) and the logo has to be changed. From this, arose a contest; graduates, current students, and the community got to design and enter logo's to be voted upon for the new one. The new logo was chosen and was used in place of the old one beginning in the 2011-2012 school year. During the summer of 2016, the entrance to the school was rebuilt, and a bronze gator statue was placed outside of the school.\n\n"}

He was the last mayor of New York City before the consolidation of the City of Greater New York on January 1, 1898.\n\nStrong was born on March 22, 1827 near Loudonville Ohio, in Ashland County. He was the son of Abel Strong, a farmer born in 1792 in Hartford, Connecticut. His mother, Hannah Burdine Strong was born in 1798, and was from Pennsylvania. Strong was the oldest of five children, and despite only a rudimentary rural education, became a clerk in a Wooster dry goods store to help support his family after the death of his father in 1840.\n\nStrong later attended the Vermillion Institute in Hayesville, Ohio.\n\nIn 1853, Strong moved to New York City, where he worked at the L.O. Wilson and Company dry goods firm. In the Panic of 1857, the business failed and Strong moved on to work for Farnham, Dale, and Company. \n\nBy 1870, he had his own dry goods company, called William L. Strong and Company. It was very successful, opening branches in many cities and eventually making Strong a millionaire. In 1890, Strong became president of the First National Bank.\n\nStrong was also president of the Central National Bank, president of the Homer Lee Bank Note Company, Vice President of the New York Security and Trust Company and director for the Erie Railroad and the Plaza Bank.\n\nIn the 1880s, Strong became active in politics. He ran for U.S. Congress in 1882 but was unsuccessful.\n\nStrong, a Republican, was elected on a Fusion Party ticket by Republican and anti-Tammany Democrats. Strong served as mayor of New York from January 1, 1895 to December 31, 1897, gaining an extra year on his term because of the impending consolidation of New York City, which moved elections to odd-numbered years. He won by a decisive majority of more than 42,000 votes and was joined in victory by John W. Goff, the Republican candidate for city recorder and a new Republican majority for the New York City Board of Aldermen.\n\nStrong's victory was optimistically hailed by the New York press as representative of an epic defeat of Tammany's \"fraud, chicane, trickery, double-dealing and contempt for the moral sense of the community\" and the new mayor cast as standard-bearer of \"a revolution that closes a dark and opens a bright era in the municipal affairs of New York.\"\n\nThe reform-minded Strong established the New York City Board of Education, created small parks, and is credited as the \"father\" of the city's Department of Correction. The Department of Public Charities and Correction had been split by Governor Levi Morton in 1894 into two departments. Strong appointed former U.S. Civil Service Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt as Police Commissioner. Roosevelt was noted for fighting corruption and making the police department more professional.\n\nStrong's leadership help pass the School Reform Law in 1896. In the late 1890s, New York State legislators passed a law mandating bath houses for cities with more than 50,000 people. Strong agreed with the law's necessity due to sanitation issues caused by overcrowding. The city's bath houses, originally built for cleanliness and bathing, were later used for recreation.\n\nIn 1866, Strong married Mary Urania Aborn (1843–1921), the daughter of Robert W. Aborn of New Jersey. Together, Mary and William were the parents of two children:\n\n\nStrong died in his home on November 2, 1900. After complaining of not feeling well, he retired to his room. During the night, he worsened very quickly, and he died early that morning, leaving behind a wife and two adult children. He was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the borough of The Bronx in New York City. His widow died of heart disease at The Mount, their daughter's residence in Lenox, Massachusetts (and the former home of author Edith Wharton), in July 1921.\n\nThe Fire Department of New York operated a fireboat named \"William L. Strong\" from 1898 to 1945.\n"}

He spent the majority of his career at 20th Century Fox crafting well regarded romantic and historical dramas, usually adapted from another medium. Dunne was a leading Screen Writers Guild organizer and was politically active during the \"Hollywood Blacklist\" episode of the 1940s-1950s. He is best known for the films \"How Green Was My Valley\" (1941), \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" (1947), \"The Robe\" (1953) and \"The Agony and the Ecstasy\" (1965).\n\nDunne received two Academy Award nominations for screenwriting: \"How Green Was My Valley\" (1941) and \"David and Bathsheba\" (1951). He also received a Golden Globe nomination for his 1965 screen adaptation of Irving Stone's novel \"The Agony and the Ecstasy\", as well as several peer awards from the Writers Guild of America (WGA), including the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement.\n\nMany notable directors worked with Dunne's screenplays, including Carol Reed, John Ford, Jacques Tourneur, Elia Kazan, Otto Preminger, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and Michael Curtiz, among others.\n\nDunne was born in New York City, the son of Chicago syndicated columnist and humorist Finley Peter Dunne and Margaret Ives (Abbott) Dunne, an Olympic champion golfer and the daughter of the \"Chicago Tribune\"'s book reviewer and novelist, Mary Ives Abbott.\n\nAlthough a Roman Catholic, he attended Middlesex School (1920–1925) and Harvard University (1925–1929). Immediately after graduation, he boarded a train for Hollywood for his health and to seek work.\n\nDunne was not initially interested in working in the film industry but that is the first place he got a job. Via a recommendation from a friend of his brother's he obtained work at Fox as a reader at $35 a week. Also among readers at the time was Leonard Spigelglass. Dunne later recalled:\nWe got nothing but the worst stuff; all the good books and plays went through the New York readers’ department. We got the pathetic originals written by out-of-work screenwriters. I kept seeing ways that I thought I could improve them. I’d write a synopsis, and I’d make it better. I couldn’t help it. It would be an obvious thing that the guy had missed. And when you learn to synopsize a story, you learn to construct it. At the same time, I was moonlighting writing short stories, so all these things came together.”\nIn 1931, Dunne was fired from Fox after less than a year at the studio in a cost-cutting move. He was briefly under contract at MGM, writing a comedy for them, but was unhappy with his work and resigned after hanging in his first draft. This script was subsequently filmed as \"Student Tour\" (1934), which Dunne never saw.\n\nDunne aso worked uncredited on \"Me and My Gal\" (1932).\n\nThe first important screenplay of Dunne's career was \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" (1934), produced by Edward Small. Dunne was brought on to the project after the novel had been distilled to a treatment by director Rowland V. Lee and Dan Totheroh, and Dunne helped finesse the script into scenes and did the dialogue. Dunne later credited Lee as an important mentor for him.\n\nSmall kept Dunne on to work on the script for \"The Melody Lingers On\" (1935). He was also credited for \"Helldorado\" (1935), the latter at Fox for Jesse Lasky, another early mentor.\n\nHe did some minor uncredited work on \"Under Pressure\" (1935) and \"Magnificent Obsession\" (1935).\n\nDunne received a lot of acclaim for his adaptation of \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1936) for Small which he wrote with John L. Balderstone. Dunne claimed the script was hurt by later rewrites from another writer, but the script, rather than the original novel, formed the basis of the 1992 film version.\n\nFor Universal he wrote \"Breezing Home\" (1937) which he later said was the first of what he considered only four original screenplays he would write in his career.\n\nAfter working for various studios, he moved to 20th Century Fox in 1937, where he would remain for 25 years (excepting 4 years civilian war service during World War II), scripting 36 films in total and directing 10. He also produced several of his later films.\n\nHis first assignment at Fox was \"Lancer Spy\" (1937), with George Sanders. He then did three films in collaboration with Julien Josephson which established him as one of the leading writers at the studio: \"Suez\" (1938), \"Stanley and Livingstone\" (1939), and \"The Rains Came\" (1939).\n\nAlone Dunne wrote \"Swanee River\" (1939), and \"Johnny Apollo\" (1940) (rewriting Rowland Brown's draft).\n\nHe wrote \"How Green Was My Valley\" (1941) originally developed with William Wyler then taken over by John Ford. He also wrote \"\" (1942).\n\nFrom 1942 to 1945, Dunne was the Chief of Production for the Motion Picture Bureau, U.S. Office of War Information, Overseas Branch. He wrote films such as \"Salute to France\" (1943).\n\nNotably, he produced the non-fiction short \"The Town\" (1944), directed by Josef von Sternberg, which has received some critical acclaim.\n\nDunne returned to Fox after the war and quickly re-established himself as one of the studio's leading writers with credits including \"The Late George Apley\" (1947), and \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" (1947).\n\nHe wrote \"Forever Amber\" (1947) in collaboration with Ring Lardner Jr and wrote \"Escape\" (1948) and \"The Luck of the Irish\" (1948). He revised Dudley Nichols' script for \"Pinky\" (1949).\n\nIn 1949 he and Otto Preminger were working on a film \"The Far East Story\" which was never made.\n\nDunne moved into spectacles with \"David and Bathsheba\" (1951), based on the story in the Bible but which Dunne considered his second \"original\". It was a huge hit. Zanuck put Dunne on Queen of Sheba but it was never made.\n\nHe also wrote \"Anne of the Indies\" (1951) and \"Lydia Bailey\" (1952).\n\nDunne turned producer with \"Way of a Gaucho\" (1952) which he also wrote. As a writer only he worked on \"The Robe\" (1953), the first movie in CinemaScope and a huge success. Dunne had enjoyed writing \"David and Bathsheba\" but said working on \"The Robe\" was \"a chore\" which he only did \"as a favor to Zanuck\".\n\nHe was announced for a film \"The Story of Jezebel\" which was not made. Dunne wrote the sequel to \"The Robe\", \"Demetrius and the Gladiators\" (1954), his third original, which was also a hit.\n\nHowever another spectacle Dunne wrote (from a draft by Casey Robinson), \"The Egyptian\" (1954), was a box-office disappointment. Dunne says he acted as an unofficial producer on this film.\n\nDunne was assigned to produce \"Prince of Players\" (1955) from a script by Moss Hart. When he could not find a director he was happy with, Darryl F. Zanuck suggested Dunne to do the job himself.\n\nDunne later said \"I started directing too late and, no question, at the wrong time. Twentieth Century Fox, the studio system, were falling apart. The boat had sailed.\"\n\nDunne wrote, produced and directed \"The View from Pompey's Head\" (1955). He wrote and directed \"Hilda Crane\" (1956). That was produced by Herbert Swope who also produced \"Three Brave Men\" (1957) which Dunne wrote and directed.\n\nHe directed and did some writing on \"In Love and War\" (1958), a war time drama, featuring many of the studio's young contract players. Edward Anhalt wrote it and Jerry Wald produced.\n\nDunne wrote and directed two films for producer Charles Brackett: \"Ten North Frederick\" (1958) with Gary Cooper, and \"Blue Denim\" (1959).\n\nIn 1961, he directed \"Wild in the Country\", starring Elvis Presley, from a screenplay by Clifford Odets and produced by Wald.\n\nIn 1962, he directed \"Lisa\", based on the novel \"The Inspector\" by Jan de Hartog and featuring Stephen Boyd and Dolores Hart, which was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Picture - Drama. Dunne did not wrote it.\n\nDunne worked on \"The Agony and the Ecstasy\" (1965) as a writer only. Although based on a novel by Irving Stone, Dunne later said he considered this an original. \"I called it Quirt and Flagg in the Sistine Chapel,\" he said later.\n\nHe wrote and directed \"Blindfold\" (1966), at Universal. It was his last feature. He was reportedly working on an adaptation of \"The Consort\" a novel by Anthony Hextall Smith, but it was never made.\n\nThe 1992 film \"The Last of the Mohicans\", directed by Michael Mann and starring Daniel Day-Lewis, was based on Dunne's 1936 screenplay of the Fenimore Cooper novel.\n\nIn addition to screenwriting, Dunne wrote syndicated newspaper articles and was a contributor to \"The New Yorker\" and \"The Atlantic Monthly\" magazines.\n\nHe wrote speeches for various Democratic politicians such as Adlai Stevenson.\n\nHe also wrote a stage play, \"Mr. Dooley's America\" (1976), based on his father's humor, and another, \"Politics\" (1980).\n\nHis books include \"Mr Dooley Remembers\" (1963) and \"Take Two: A Life in Movies and Politics\" (1980). His short stories appeared in the \"New Yorker\" and his essays were regular features of \"Time Magazine\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", and the \"Harvard Review\".\n\nHe was a winner of the Laurel Award (1962) and the Valentine Davies Award (1974).\n\nThe week before he died he was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the Writers Guild.\n\nDunne has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in front of 6725 Hollywood Boulevard, just west of Las Palmas Ave.\n\nDunne was a co-founder of the Screen Writers Guild and served as vice-president of its successor, the Writers Guild of America, from 1938 to 1940. He later served on the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) from 1946 to 1948.\n\nBefore World War II, he was a member of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, a group founded in May 1940 that advocated military materiel aid to Britain as the best way to keep the United States out of the war.\n\nDunne was a key participant in the Hollywood Blacklist episode of the 1940s and 1950s. In 1947 he co-founded the Committee for the First Amendment with John Huston and William Wyler in response to hearings held by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Dunne, Huston, and Wyler, along with fellow members Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Danny Kaye, and Gene Kelly, appeared before HUAC in Washington, D.C. in October 1947, protesting HUAC's activities and methods. Dunne was never subpoenaed or blacklisted himself, nor was he accused of any Communist Party affiliations.\n\nAs a writer and director, Dunne frequently worked with others who either were, had been, or would become blacklisted, including Ring Lardner Jr., Clifford Odets, Albert Maltz, and Marsha Hunt. Additionally, Dunne was a character witness for Dalton Trumbo at the latter's trial for contempt of Congress.\n\nThe original credits for \"The Robe\" (1953) gave Dunne the sole screenplay credit, when in fact Hollywood Ten member Albert Maltz had made significant contributions. In 1997, the WGA restored full writing credits to blacklisted writers whose names were left out of films they worked on. The following is from the WGA's \"Blacklisted Writers Receive Credit\" press release of April 2, 1997:\n\nIn the case of The Robe there was an extraordinary amount of information gathered to indicate that Maltz was entitled to shared screenplay credit. In addition, Philip Dunne did not believe he deserved sole screenplay credit but it was not until many years later that he learned that a blacklisted writer had worked on the project. Amanda Dunne, Philip's widow, confirms that Philip would have been happy to share screenplay credit with Maltz.\n\nDunne's political stance was decidedly liberal and reformist, but he was also determinedly anti-Communist. His involvement in the Committee for the First Amendment can arguably be read as just that—support for Constitutional free speech against a government entity (HUAC) that, to Dunne, seemed determined to usurp those rights. At various times dating to before the Second World War, he clashed with fellow members of the Screen Writers Guild who he felt were \"pro-Stalin\" Communists. Dunne's anti-Communist leanings would seem to be verified by his uninterrupted employment as a screenwriter on major Hollywood productions throughout the blacklist period, despite his quite vocal denunciation of HUAC.\n\nDunne married the former Amanda Duff (1914-2006) on July 13, 1939. They had three children, Miranda, Philippa, and Jessica.\n\nIn 1980, he published his memoirs, \"Take Two: A Life in Movies and Politics\".\n\nDunne died of cancer on June 2, 1992, in Malibu, California, aged 84.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The line began operations on November 20, 1954 on an abandoned Southern Pacific Transportation Company right-of-way as the White City Terminal & Utilities Co., and was renamed after the Union Tank Car Company bought it in 1974. WCTU Railway was owned by Marmon Transportation Services LLC, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nAround 2000, WCTU acquired the engine RSS SW1200 #82 (formerly RF&P 82). After waiting for about a year before it was ready for service, it became the No. 1 power, with #5119 as back-up, while the 5117 was basically out of service. About 2004 they received another SW1200 engine, the 1503. Now WCTU uses one unit for a month, then swaps units.

{"id": "2254976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254976", "title": "Long Tall Sally", "text": "Long Tall Sally\n\n\"Long Tall Sally\" is a rock and roll 12-bar blues song written by Robert \"Bumps\" Blackwell, Enotris Johnson, and Little Richard; recorded by Little Richard; and released in March 1956 on the Specialty Records label.\n\nThe b-side was \"Slippin' and Slidin'\". Both songs were subsequently released in the LP \"Here's Little Richard\" (Specialty, March 1957). The single reached number one on the \"Billboard\" rhythm and blues chart, staying at the top for six of 19 weeks, while peaking at number six on the pop chart. It received the \"Cash Box\" Triple Crown Award in 1956. The song as sung by Little Richard is #55 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nIt became one of the singer's best-known hits and has become a rock and roll standard covered by hundreds of artists, including Elvis Presley and the Beatles.\n\nThe song was originally called \"The Thing\", recorded in New Orleans by Little Richard. Penniman's track was No. 45 on Billboard's \nyear-end singles of 1956.\n\n\"Tutti Frutti\" had been a big hit for Little Richard and Specialty in early 1956, reaching No. 2 in the R&B charts. Pat Boone's cover version of the song reached No. 12 in the pop charts. Although this meant an unexpected cash income for the Specialty publishing firm, A&R man and producer \"Bumps\" Blackwell and a proud Richard decided to write a song that was so up-tempo and the lyrics so fast that Boone would not be able to handle it (Boone eventually did record his own version, however, getting it to No. 18).\n\nAccording to Blackwell, he was introduced to a little girl by Honey Chile, a popular disc-jockey. Apparently, the girl had written a song for Little Richard to record so she could pay the treatment for her ailing aunt Mary. The song, actually a few lines on a piece of paper, went like this:\nNot wishing to upset an influential disc-jockey, Blackwell accepted the offer and took the idea to Richard, who was reluctant at first. Nevertheless, the line \"ducked back in the alley\" was exactly what they were looking for, and Richard kept practicing until he could sing it as fast as possible. They worked on the song, adding verses and a chorus, until they got the hit they wanted. The credit to Enotris Johnson, Richard's adoptive father, was added, probably as an act of benevolence. Featuring a tenor saxophone solo by Lee Allen (as did \"Tutti Frutti\"), \"Long Tall Sally\" was the best-selling 45 of the history of Specialty Records.\n\nThe recording session took place on February 10, 1956 at J&M Studio in New Orleans, the legendary studio owned by Cosimo Matassa on the corner of Rampart and Dumaine where Fats Domino and many other New Orleans luminaries recorded. \"Long Tall Sally\", as well as many other Little Richard sides, was also recorded there.\n\nThe music was a fast uptempo number with Little Richard's hammering, boogie piano. Richard plays staccato straight eighth notes while drummer Palmer plays a fast shuffle. The shuffle was the most common rhythm and blues beat; Richard added the straight eighth notes, much less common in that time, although now standard for rock music. Together this created an ambiguity in the ride rhythm—known to musicians as \"playing in the crack\" that came to characterize New Orleans (and also Chuck Berry) rock and roll. In typical Little Richard style, he sang in the key of F, in a raw, aggressive, exhilarating style with lyrics being about self-centered fun.\nAlthough the lyrics are light-weight, Little Richard's style triumphs over content and provides a wonderful vehicle for his enthusiastic exhibitionism.\n\n\n\nThe Beatles were great admirers of Little Richard, and recorded many of his songs during their career. \"Long Tall Sally\" was the most durable song in their live repertoire, lasting from their earliest days as the Quarrymen in 1957 through to their last public concert in August 1966. As with the majority of their Little Richard remakes, Paul McCartney sang lead vocals, as he could most closely imitate Richard's vocal style.\n\nThe group recorded \"Long Tall Sally\" at EMI Studios in London on 1 March 1964, during sessions for \"A Hard Day's Night\", although it was ultimately not included on that album. The recording was produced by the Beatles' regular producer, George Martin, who also played piano on the track. Given the group's familiarity with the song, the recording was completed in a single take.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the track was released on the \"Long Tall Sally\" EP on 19 June 1964; however, it had been released earlier on two overseas albums, \"The Beatles' Second Album\" in the United States on 10 April, and \"The Beatles' Long Tall Sally\" in Canada on 11 May. Released as a single in Sweden, the song topped the Kvällstoppen Chart in July and August.\n\nThe song appears on the film \"Backbeat\". Upon viewing it, Paul McCartney was reported to say:\n\nIn addition to their studio recording of the song, the Beatles recorded \"Long Tall Sally\" for BBC radio broadcasts on seven occasions during 1963 and 1964. Two of these versions have been officially released, on the compilation albums \"Live at the BBC\" (1994) and \"On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2\" (2013). In addition, a studio version prerecorded specially from the 1964 television special \"Around the Beatles\" was included on the \"Anthology 1\" compilation (1995). The live album \"The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl\" (1977) includes a 1964 concert recording of the song.\n\n\"Long Tall Sally\" was the last song the Beatles ever performed live in front of a paying audience. The song was a frequent set closer during their 1966 world tour—which would turn out to be their last—and they used it to close out their final show at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on August 29, 1966. The band asked their press officer, Tony Barrow, to make an audio tape recording of the concert for posterity (the recording has since circulated heavily among bootleggers), but the 30-minute tape ran out at the end of the second verse of \"Long Tall Sally\"—making the last moments of the Beatles' final live show lost to history.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2254979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254979", "title": "Brian Mailhot", "text": "Brian Mailhot\n\nBrian Mailhot (born August 12, 1975) is an American professional wrestler and mixed martial arts fighter, better known for his short stint in World Wrestling Entertainment's SmackDown! brand under the ring name of Palmer Canon.\n\nMailhot debuted in 1999 for the Eastern Wrestling Alliance, losing to Larry Huntley in a match in Portland, Maine. After his first match Mailhot elected to take more time to focus on his in ring training and worked for the Eastern Wrestling Alliance in a character role as their commissioner. As commissioner he feuded with Alexander Worthington III, often countering Worthington's devious exploits with his power as commissioner although he did not wrestle a match again until early 2002 when his dealings with Worthington finally escalated to an in ring encounter.\n\nIn 2002 he began working for Chaotic Wrestling in Massachusetts as \"Big League\" Brian Black. He formed a tag team with The Mighty Mini, and the partners won the CW Tag Team Championships on two occasions, in 2003 defeating Atrition and 2004, defeating Peter Mulloy and Brian Buffet. Mailhot won his first singles championship, the vacant New England Championship, on April 30, 2004, in a twenty-eight man royal rumble. He won the Heavyweight Championship on March 18, 2005, defeating Maverick Wild, but vacated the title on April 1 after signing a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment in March 2005.\n\nDuring this time Mailhot was also wrestling for the now sold and renamed All-Star Wrestling Association based in Nashua, New Hampshire. He debuted as Brian Black on February 21, 2004, in a loss to Adam Booker, which led to a short feud between the two. Following that he captured the AWA Tag Team Championship on May 15, 2004 in Claremont, New Hampshire with The Mighty Mini, his tag partner from Chaotic Wrestling. This turned into a phantom switch, though, when Mailhot changed to a new persona the next show. Since the switch took place outside of their typical venue in Nashua it was simply ignored and the titles were returned to The Swerve. On May 22, 2004, he debuted a German character of his own creation, \"Otto Von Schwartz\". Taking full advantage of his German heritage and ability to speak German, he worked as a heel, feuding primarily with Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine. He captured the AWA Heavyweight Championship from Valentine on September 25, 2004, but dropped it on April 9, 2005. He then departed to the WWE developmental Deep South Wrestling.\n\nMailhot began training in WWE's auxiliary developmental territory, Deep South Wrestling. On May 2, 2005 he had a dark match against Todd Hansen, with Hansen gaining the victory.\n\nHe made his televised debut with WWE on the August 25, 2005 episode of \"SmackDown!\" as an authority figure called Palmer Canon. His character was ostensibly a representative of the oppressive \"Network\". This gimmick reflected what WWE perceived as increasing interference by UPN regarding the content of \"SmackDown!\", most notably UPN's demand that WWE remove Mark Copani's controversial Muhammad Hassan character from television. His character and booking of matches that the fans disliked led to mainly heel reactions, though he played face at times such as during Survivor Series, where he helped \"SmackDown!\" general manager Theodore Long defeat \"Raw\" general manager Eric Bischoff. The gimmick was reminiscent of both Right to Censor, a stable created to parody the Parents Television Council, and The Network, an ECW stable led by Cyrus which claimed to represent TNN. The name Palmer Canon might have been a play with the initials \"\"P.C.\"\". This connection between his name and political correctness was made more evident when commentator Tazz called him P.C. when Canon came to do ringside commentary. His character also consisted of booking matches behind the back of Theodore Long (e.g. he made Eddie Guerrero the number one contender, despite Long's wishes to have that right go to Rey Mysterio). He also introduced Marty Wright as \"The Boogeyman\" as a decision by the network for ratings, added \"The Juniors\", a midget wrestling division and the tag team \"The Dicks\" (John Toland and Chad Wicks), though all were later released. Wright's release only lasted two weeks, however.\n\nOn the February 3, 2006 edition of \"SmackDown!\", William Regal and Paul Burchill told Palmer Canon that they no longer wanted to be a tag team so they could go their separate ways. During this discussion Burchill informed Canon that his family heritage traces back to pirates, and that he wanted to do a pirate gimmick on \"Friday Night SmackDown!\" Later, on the April 21, 2006 edition of \"SmackDown!\", Canon remarked that The Miz was acting inappropriately, and had him escorted from the arena by security.\n\nOn April 20, 2006, Mailhot abruptly flew himself home from a WWE tour in Italy and gave his notice to WWE officials, citing harassment from Chris Benoit, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield and his \"Wrestler's Court\" as the reason for his resignation. He was granted his release on April 27, 2006. This forced the postponement of the Miz's planned wrestling debut, as the Palmer Canon/Miz feud had to be canceled. During his run on \"SmackDown!\", Mailhot never wrestled a match there despite being a trained wrestler.\n\nMailhot has now returned to Portland, Maine.\n\nBrian made his amateur MMA debut on August 23, 2008 at Untamed 22 as Brian \"Hacksaw\" Mailhot. It was promoted by Full Force Fighting Championships, at the Plymouth Memorial Hall. He defeated Tony Rea via KO by slam in 1:01 of the second round.\n\nHe has wrestled for All Out Mayhem in southern and eastern Maine since his departure from WWE in 2006. He won the AOM Heavyweight Championship from Captain Freedom in South Portland, Maine on November 20, 2010 only to lose it later in the night to Larry Zbyszko.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2254999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254999", "title": "Ludus latrunculorum", "text": "Ludus latrunculorum\n\nLudus latrunculorum, latrunculi, or simply latrones (“the game of brigands”, from \"latrunculus\", diminutive of \"latro\", mercenary or highwayman) was a two-player strategy board game played throughout the Roman Empire. It is said to resemble chess or draughts, but is generally accepted to be a game of military tactics. Because of the scarcity of sources, reconstruction of the game's rules and basic structure is difficult, and therefore there are multiple interpretations of the available evidence.\n\nThe game of \"latrunculi\" is believed to be a variant of earlier Greek games known variously as \"Petteia\", \"pessoí\", \"psêphoi\", \"poleis\" and \"pente grammaí\", to which references are found as early as Homer's time. In Plato's Republic, Socrates' opponents are compared to “bad Petteia players, who are finally cornered and made unable to move.” In the \"Phaedrus\", Plato writes that these games come from Egypt, and a draughts-like game called \"Seega\" is known to have been played in ancient Egypt.\n\nIn his \"Onomasticon\", the Greek writer Julius Pollux describes \"Poleis\" as follows:\n\nThe game played with many pieces is a board with spaces disposed among lines: the board is called the “city” and each piece is called a “dog;” the pieces are of two colors, and the art of the game consists in taking a piece of one color by enclosing it between two of the other color.\n\nAmong the Romans, the first mention of \"latrunculi\" is found in the Roman author Varro (116–27 BC), in the tenth book of his \"De Lingua Latina\" (“On the Latin Language”), where he mentions the game in passing, comparing the grid on which it is played to the grid used for presenting declensions. An account of a game of \"latrunculi\" is given in the 1st-century AD \"Laus Pisonis\":\n\nWhen you are weary with the weight of your studies, if perhaps you are pleased not to be inactive but to start games of skill, in a more clever way you vary the moves of your counters on the open board, and wars are fought out by a soldiery of glass, so that at one time a white counter traps blacks, and at another a black traps whites. Yet what counter has not fled from you? What counter gave way when you were its leader? What counter [of yours] though doomed to die has not destroyed its foe? Your battle line joins combat in a thousand ways: that counter, flying from a pursuer, itself makes a capture; another, which stood at a vantage point, comes from a position far retired; this one dares to trust itself to the struggle, and deceives an enemy advancing on its prey; that one risks dangerous traps, and, apparently entrapped itself, counter traps two opponents; this one is advanced to greater things, so that when the formation is broken, it may quickly burst into the columns, and so that, when the rampart is overthrown, it may devastate the closed walls. Meanwhile, however keenly the battle rages with cut-up soldiers, you conquer with a formation that is full, or bereft of only a few soldiers, and each of your hands rattles with its band of captives.\n\nAllusions to the game are found in the works of such writers as Martial and Ovid and they provide ideal evidence as to the method of capture used in the game with passages such as: \"unus cum gemino calculus hoste perit\", Ov. Ars amatoria 3.358 (\"when one counter perishes by a twin foe\"); \"cum medius gemino calculus hoste perit\", Ov. Tristia 2.478 (\"when a counter perishes in the midst by a twin foe\"); and \"calculus hae (sc. tabula) gemino discolor hoste perit\", Mart. 14.17.2 (\"a counter of differing colour perishes on this [board] with a twin enemy\").\n\nOvid also writes about the efforts to rescue an isolated piece away from the others: \"how the different colored soldier marches forth in a straight line; when a piece caught between two adversaries is imperiled, how one advancing may be skilful to attack and rescue a piece moved forward, and retreating may move safely, not uncovered\" (Tristia II 477-480). According to Ulrich Schädler, this indicates that the pieces in the game only moved one space per turn, instead of using the Rook's move, otherwise an isolated piece's escape would have been relatively easy. Schädler also deduces from this that pieces were able to jump over other pieces into an empty square beyond, otherwise a rescuing piece could end up blocking the other piece needing rescue.\n\nThe last mention of \"latrunculi\" that survives from the Roman period is in the \"Saturnalia\" of Macrobius.\n\nFor a long time, it was thought that the eighteenth book of Isidore of Seville's \"Etymologiae\" contains a reference to \"latrunculi\", and this was used to argue that the pieces on either side were of different powers and classes like the men in chess. R. G. Austin has argued, however, that the passage of Isidore on which this belief was based refers to an early form of Tabula. \nThe Stanway game, excavated near Colchester, has been identified by scholars such as David Parlett as possibly being an example of \"latrunculi\". If this is true then it is possible there was a second piece other than the soldiers used in the game, and this has been interpreted by some reconstructions as a piece representing a \"Dux\" (leader) or \"Aquila\" (eagle). However, Ulrich Schädler suggests the game may instead be an example of a tafl game, such as fidhcheall or gwyddbwyll, since there is no evidence for an extra piece other than the \"latrones\" or \"pessoi\" in any of the ancient Greek and Roman games.\n\n\"Latrunculi\" as well as \"latrones\" is mentioned many times in Ruy López de Segura's classic 1561 work \"Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez\", also referring to mentions in Jacobus de Cessolis's sermons on the theme of chess in the later thirteenth century.\n\nLatrunculi is mentioned on the first page of Philidor's classic 1774 work \"Analysis of the Game of Chess.\"\n\nMyron J. Samsin and Yuri Averbakh have both supported the theory that \"Petteia\" may have had an influence on the historical development of early Chess, particularly the movement of the pawns. \"Petteia\" games could have certainly been brought to central Asia and northern India during the rule of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and Indo-Greek Kingdom which were known to combine Indian and Greek elements in their art, coinage, and religious practices.\n\nWhen chess came to Germany, the chess terms for \"chess\" and \"check\" (which had originated in Persian) entered the German language as \"Schach\". But \"Schach\" was already a native German word for robbery. As a result, \"ludus latrunculorum\" was often used as a medieval Latin name for chess.\n\nSince, in archaeological excavations, it is usually hard to tell what game a gridded board was used for, it is hard to determine the size of the board on which \"latrunculi\" was played. R. C. Bell, writing in 1960, mentioned boards of 7×8, 8×8, and 9×10 squares as common in Roman Britain. W. J. Kowalski refers to the \"Stanway Game\", an archeological find of 1996 in Stanway, Essex, England, and believes the game was played on a board of 8×12 squares; the same size that was used a thousand years later for courier chess. He later allowed a board of 10×11 squares. The rules may have varied much across the width of the Roman Empire and through time.\n\nUse a normal checkerboard with 8x8 squares. The two players agree about the number of pieces, at least 16, but not more than 24 for each player. If the board is larger, then the number of pieces increases too. Use pieces such as coins or hemispheres with different sides that can be flipped.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the rules from the Museum Quintana () Künzing (pictured above):\n\nIn China the various board games in the family of Fang Qi (方棋, Square Game) have similar rules. Typically board size varies from 4×4 in Korea (Gonu) to 17×17 in Tibet. Most varieties have the initial \"Placing Stone\" phase, followed by the \"Removing Stone\" phase (if any), and then finally the \"Capturing Stone\" phase.\n\n"}

In addition, all no-hitters that were broken up in extra innings or were in shortened games are listed, although they are not currently considered official no-hitters. (Prior to 1991, a performance in which no hits were surrendered through nine innings or in a shortened game was considered an official no-hit game.) The names of those pitchers who threw a perfect game no-hitter are \"italicized\". For combined no-hitters by two or more pitchers on the same team, each is listed with his number of innings pitched. Games which were part of a doubleheader are noted as either the first game or second game. The most recent no-hitter was pitched by Justin Verlander of the Houston Astros on September 1, 2019.\n\nAn official no-hit game occurs when a pitcher (or pitchers) allows no hits during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings thrown by the pitcher(s). In a no-hit game, a batter may still reach base via a walk, an error, a fielder's choice, an intentional walk, a hit by pitch, a passed ball or wild pitch on strike three, or catcher's interference. Also, due to these methods of reaching base, it is possible for a team to score runs without getting any hits.\n\nWhile the vast majority of no-hitters are shutouts, no-hit teams have managed to score runs in their respective games a number of times. Five times a team has been no-hit and still won the game: two notable victories occurred when the Cincinnati Reds defeated the Houston Colt .45s (now called the Houston Astros) 1–0 on April 23, 1964 even though they were no-hit by Houston starter Ken Johnson, and the Detroit Tigers defeated the Baltimore Orioles 2–1 on April 30, 1967 even though they were no-hit by Baltimore starter Steve Barber and reliever Stu Miller. In another four games, the home team won despite gaining no hits through eight innings, but these are near no-hitters under the 1991 rule that nine no-hit innings must be completed in order for a no-hitter to be credited.\n\nThe pitcher who holds the record for the shortest time between no-hitters is Johnny Vander Meer, the only pitcher in history to throw no-hitters in consecutive starts, while playing for the Cincinnati Reds in 1938. Besides Vander Meer, Allie Reynolds (in 1951), Virgil Trucks (in 1952), Nolan Ryan (in 1973), and Max Scherzer (in 2015) are the only other major leaguers to throw two no-hitters in the same regular season. Jim Maloney technically threw two no-hitters in the 1965 season, but his first one ended after he allowed a home run in the top of the 11th inning. According to the rules interpretation of the time, this was considered a no-hitter. Later that season, Maloney once again took a no-hitter into extra innings, but this time he managed to preserve the no-hitter after the Reds scored in the top half of the tenth, becoming the first pitcher to throw a complete game extra inning no-hitter since Fred Toney in 1917. \nRoy Halladay threw two no-hitters in 2010: a perfect game during the regular season and a no-hitter in the 2010 National League Division Series. He is the only major leaguer to have thrown no-hitters in regular season and postseason play.\n\nThe first black pitcher to toss a no-hitter was Sam Jones who did it for the Chicago Cubs in 1955. The first Latin pitcher to throw one was San Francisco Giant Juan Marichal in 1963. The first Asian pitcher to throw one was Los Angeles Dodger Hideo Nomo in 1996.\n\nThrough September 1, 2019, there have been 303 no-hitters officially recognized by Major League Baseball, 260 of them in the modern era (starting in 1901, with the formation of the American League). Joe Borden's no-hitter in 1875 is also noted, but is not recognized by Major League Baseball (see note in the chart).\n\n\"Italics\" indicate defunct team.\n\nRegulation games in which a pitcher or staff pitches less than nine full innings, or in which a hit is allowed in extra innings, do not qualify as no-hitters. However, before the rules were tightened in 1991, such games did count as official no-hitters.\n\nOwing to the fact that the home team does not bat in the bottom of the ninth inning if they are leading after the top, a visiting pitcher (or pitchers) may complete a full game without allowing a hit but not be credited with an official no-hitter. If the visiting team allows a sufficient number of runs for the home team to win after the top of the ninth, whether by walks, errors, or anything else not involving hits, the pitcher(s) will not be credited with an official no-hitter because they only pitched eight innings (though such no-hitters were counted before 1991). This has happened only four times in major-league history.\n\n\n\n\nUnder certain circumstances, if a game cannot continue because of the weather, darkness, or any other reason, but if at least five innings have been completed, the game can count as an officially completed game. No-hitters pitched under such circumstances were counted before 1991, but no longer count as official no-hitters because nine innings were not completed. Pitchers listed in bold signify the pitcher was pitching a perfect game until the game was shortened. These games do not count as official perfect games.\n\nIn many instances, these games were shortened by regulations such as darkness (in an era before lights), rules to make doubleheaders seven innings (the second game, or both games, may be seven innings; still used in amateur and lower-level professional leagues) in order to avoid darkness from shortening games, or curfews, especially when teams needed to travel on regularly scheduled trains, buses, or flights (in the era before chartered flights). On rare occasions, the team that pitched a no-hitter also lost the game while pitching on the road - resulting in only 8 innings pitched because the opposing team did not bat in the bottom of the 9th inning.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo-hitters were formerly counted even if hits were allowed in extra innings, but not after the rules were tightened in 1991. Pitchers listed in bold signify the pitcher was pitching a perfect game through nine innings.\n\n\n\n"}

The organisation aims to bring people, ideas and engineering together to respond to the world’s most pressing problems.\n\nEngineers Without Borders UK is a membership based registered charity. It has a small number of employees, augmented by volunteers, who head up the national organisation and a large number of member groups around the UK.\n\nThe National Team designs, resources and coordinates all of Engineers Without Borders UK’s initiatives and implements the organisation’s strategy. Comprising salaried staff, who are based in central London, and volunteers from across the UK, it is also responsible for ensuring compliance with all financial and legal regulations as delegated by the Board of Trustees.\n\nEngineers Without Borders UK's Member Groups are broadly divided into two type; Regional Networks and University Member Groups. All are affiliated to the national organisation under the terms of an affiliation agreement that grants them the use of the organisation's brand, logo and name for approved activities, including taking part in or delivering some projects, programmes and initiatives, and fundraising for the charity. Networks, which refer to themselves as 'EWB [area] Regional Network', are divided into a number of geographic regions and organise speaker events, debates, social functions and fundraising opportunities. They also provide technical assistance and mentorship to the student branches in their geographical area. There are more than 20 University Member Groups, which are also student societies at the Universities in which they are situated. University Member Groups are named 'EWB [University name]' (e.g. EWB University of Bristol).\n\nEngineers Without Borders UK was started by a group of students at Cambridge University in 2001, at the original suggestion of Parker Mitchell (co-founder of EWB Canada) who was then doing an MPhil in Sustainable Development at the university. Sarah Hindle (Engineering undergraduate) and Richard Sargeant (Political Science undergraduate) were the first directors.\n\nIn 2002, Engineers Without Borders UK arranged its first overseas placement in Pondicherry, India, with an organisation called ORSED. The first large scale training course also took place in 2002 at Clare Farm outside Cambridge. The organisation was registered as a national charity in England and Wales in 2003 following groups set up at a number of other universities. The national office moved to London, where it is still based, in 2013.\n\nIn the years since 2002, under a number of different directors, the scope and nature of Engineers Without Borders UK's work has expanded and changed.\n\nEngineers Without Borders UK's international work is defined by developing the capacity of individuals and communities to respond to both global and local challenges through engineering. By developing collaborations with international partners and volunteer engineers, the organisation aims to strengthen the environmental, social and economic resilience of communities. Since 2015 Engineers Without Borders UK has focused on projects that ensure clean energy access, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), as well as maintaining safe and adequate built environments. The organisation currently works with 11 international partner NGOs on projects in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia.\n\nWork with the UK education sector now accounts for almost half of Engineers Without Borders UK's activities and targets all levels of education. The EWB Challenge, delivered in collaboration with EWB Australia, is a design module that is embedded in undergraduate engineering courses. During the 2015-16 academic year it was part of the curriculum at 27 universities around the UK and Ireland, reaching more than 4800 students (approximately 20% of the entire engineering undergraduate community). The best teams from participating universities compete at an annual finals event in June each year. This initiative is supported by the EU funded Global Dimension in Engineering Education programme that has created more than 45 chapters of supporting materials and case studies for academics to use within their teaching. An ambassador scheme enables volunteers to deliver interactive Engineers Without Borders UK's workshops in schools and at events around the country. These interactive sessions aim to inspire schoolchildren about the role of science, technology and engineering in the world today, particularly within the context of international development.\n\nEngineers Without Borders UK is a member of the Engineers Without Borders International (EWB-I) federation and sits on the Board and Executive Committee.\n\nThe organisation also has close ties with other Engineers Without Borders organisations and has recently worked with the national organisations based in Canada, Australia, the USA and France.\n\nEngineers Without Borders UK is a registered charity in England & Wales (No. 1101849) and Scotland (No. SC043537) and is a company limited by guarantee (No. 04856607).\n\nIts registered office is situated at The Foundry, 17 Oval Way, London, SE11 5RR, United Kingdom.\n\nEngineers Without Borders website: https://www.ewb-uk.org\n\nEngineers Without Borders International website: http://ewb-international.com\n"}

It is the fourth installment in \"National Lampoon\"’s \"Vacation\" film series, and was written by Elisa Bell, based on a story by Bell and Bob Ducsay. The film stars Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, Wayne Newton, Ethan Embry, and Wallace Shawn. The film opened at #4 at the box office and grossed over $36.4 million domestically. \"Vegas Vacation\" is the first theatrical \"Vacation\" film not to carry the National Lampoon label or a screenwriting credit from John Hughes.\n\nClark Griswold works in the food preservative industry, and has invented a long-life food preservative, earning him a large bonus check from Frank Shirley. To celebrate, he announces to his family that he is taking them on vacation. Part of the reason for the trip is for Clark and Ellen to renew their wedding vows. Excitement wanes, however, when Clark says they are headed to Las Vegas. His wife, Ellen, and teenage daughter, Audrey, have their doubts, as Las Vegas is not known for its family-friendly atmosphere, while teenage son Rusty appears to be more enthusiastic.\n\nUpon arriving in Vegas, the family embarks upon a series of misadventures. The Griswolds attend a Siegfried & Roy show, and they also visit Cousin Eddie, the husband of Ellen's cousin Catherine. Eddie and his family now live in the desert just north of Las Vegas, on what used to be a hydrogen-bomb test site. While on a group tour of the Hoover Dam led by guide Arty, Clark leaves the group after accidentally creating a leak in the dam's inside walkways, and is forced to climb the scaffolding to the very top of the dam to get out, because his cries for help cannot be heard over the roaring water. The next night, they are surprised to find tickets to a Wayne Newton concert have been delivered to their hotel room, along with a dress for Ellen. They go to the concert, only to realize that Newton had sent the dress. While singing, he brings Ellen up on stage to sing with him, and visits at their table.\n\nThe next day, the family agrees to an \"alone day\" and are left to their own devices. Clark goes to a casino and becomes addicted to gambling, usually losing to a snide blackjack dealer named Marty, who enjoys Clark's humiliation. Rusty gets a fake ID from a Frank Sinatra look-alike and becomes a winning high roller, taking on the pseudonym Nick Pappagiorgio. Audrey starts hanging out with Eddie's free-spirited and gorgeous exotic dancer daughter Vicki and her friends. Ellen begins spending time with Wayne Newton, who has feelings for her.\n\nClark gambles away the family's $22,600 bank account, leading a furious Ellen and the kids to desert him. Rusty goes off gambling for cars, and wins four, while Audrey goes to a strip club with Vicki and gets a job as a go-go dancer. Eddie — who has money buried in his front yard — tries to come to Clark's rescue in return for everything the Griswolds have done for him and his family over the years. Clark and Eddie go to a local casino to get their money back, but Clark ends up gambling away Eddie's money too, causing him to reevaluate his behavior. Clark then realizes he no longer cares about getting his money back, but needs to get his family back.\n\nClark then gathers up his family from around Vegas and they gamble their last two dollars on a game of keno. They sit next to an elderly man who compliments Clark on his family, and hints that he has been lonely all of his life. Out of sympathy, Clark tells the man to consider himself part of the Griswold family for the night. The man happily accepts Clark's offer, and both parties begin the game. At first, the Griswolds are optimistic, but as they realize they have already lost the game, they sit together in silence. Suddenly, the man next to them ecstatically declares that he has won the game. In his burst of joy, he suddenly begins to slip in and out of consciousness while Ellen sends Rusty for help. He revives long enough to whisper a message to Clark, before dropping his winning ticket and lapsing one final time.\n\nClark, confused, tells Ellen that the man said \"take the ticket.\" When the casino security guards and paramedics arrive, they declare the man officially dead. They tell the Griswolds his name was Mr. Ellis. As Mr. Ellis is carried away, a janitor approaches with a carpet cleaner, heading straight for the winning ticket on the floor. Though it appears Clark is going to allow it to be lost, at the last second, he slides the ticket out of the carpet cleaner's path. With their newfound winnings, Clark and Ellen renew their wedding vows.\n\nAfterwards, Clark gives Eddie $5,000 to repay his kindness. They all drive home in the four cars Rusty won on the slot machines: a red Dodge Viper, a maroon Ford Mustang, a black Hummer H1, and a white Ford Aspire.\n\nFilming was initially scheduled to begin in Las Vegas in April 1996. Filming was later scheduled to begin on May 29, 1996. Most of the filming was expected to be done in southern Nevada, while approximately 10 days of work was planned for studios in southern California. Filming in Las Vegas was expected to last two and a half months. Filming at Hoover Dam was underway in June 1996. One scene involved Chase's stunt double, John Robotham, swinging from a rope and slamming into the face of the dam. Film crews did several takes of the scene, which involved Robotham being attached to a series of ropes and bolts 637 feet above the dam's power plant. Later that month, filming took place at Las Vegas' Chapel of the Bells, where the film's producer Jerry Weintraub and his wife Jane Morgan were married in the mid-1960s. Weintraub appears in the film as \"Gilly from Philly,\" the gambler who befriends Rusty.\n\nExtensive footage was shot at The Mirage resort; owner Steve Wynn closed portions of the property to allow for filming, which included the resort's diving dolphins and its Siegfried & Roy show. Chase filmed scenes involving the show's tigers in July 1996. Filming also took place on soundstages at the Las Vegas Video Sound Film Production Center. Scenes were also shot at Casa de Shenandoah, the home of entertainer Wayne Newton. Other filming locations included the MGM Grand Las Vegas, the Klondike Hotel and Casino, O'Sheas Casino, the Neon Museum, and Fremont Street Experience.\n\nNichols and Embry became the fourth different set of actors to play the Griswold children, Audrey and Rusty. This fact is referenced early in the film when Clark Griswold comments that he hardly recognizes his children anymore.\n\n\"Vegas Vacation\" was released to cinemas in the United States on February 14, 1997. The film was later released on home video and to television.\n\nThe film received negative reviews. It has garnered a rating of 13% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews. The critic consensus states, “The \"Vacation\" franchise hits rock-bottom in this corny and tepid trip to sinfully laugh-free city.” The film was nominated for The Sequel Nobody Was Clamoring For at the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards but lost to \"\".\n\n"}

The duo started in International Championship Wrestling (ICW; later renamed International World Class Championship Wrestling or IWCCW). On December 11, 1989 the Undertakers defeated a team known as the S & S Express (Vic Steamboat and Joe Savoldi to win the ICW Tag Team Championship. Their run with the championship only lasted 17 days as the Dynamic Duo (Phil Apollo and Eric Sbraccia) defeated them on a show in Portland, Maine. In March 1990 the Undertakers won the championship again, this time renamed the IWCCW Tag Team Championship. Almost a year later, on February 20, 1991 the Undertakers lost the championship to a team known as The Billion Dollar Babies (Mike Sampson and G.Q. Stratus).\n\nAfter this the twins toured Japan, working for All Japan Pro Wrestling in February and March 1991. Their first match came on February 23, 1991 when they faced \"The Land of Giants\" duo of Butch Masters and Nitron. They also faced Mighty Inoue & Rusher Kimura, as well as Dean Malenko and Joe Malenko.\n\nAt this point in time the team changed their name after the World Wrestling Federation bought the rights to their original name to ensure there would be no confusion between the team and the WWF wrestler Mark Calaway who worked as \"the Undertaker\". The team took the name \"Double Trouble\", making their first appearance on September 30, 1991 at a dark match in Wheeling, WV where they defeated a preliminary team at a Wrestling Challenge taping. They won another dark match against preliminary opposition in Huntington, WV at a WWF Superstars taping.\n\nIn June 1992 they began teaming regularly on WWF house shows. The tour was part of the settlement that they reached with the WWF over \"The Undertaker\" name. They were winless in house show encounters with The Bushwhackers. In August they entered a house show series against High Energy, and in September they received title matches against WWF Tag-Team Champions The Natural Disasters. After going winless, Double Trouble finally gained their first victory of the year on October 2, 1992 in Poughkeepsie, NY when they defeated Mark Thomas and Phil Apollo. They finished the year facing Road Warrior Animal in handicap matches.\n\nIn 1993 they wrestled only one match, losing to The Steiner Brothers on January 30 in Providence, RI. After a lengthy absence they returned on July 7, 1994 to face the tag-team champions The Headshrinkers in Landover, MD. Following two more matches against The Headshrinkers the duo left the promotion.\n\nDuring their hiatus from the WWF in 1993, the duo also worked in the CWA. On September 23, 1993 the duo defeated The Interns to become the first ever CWA Tag Team Champions for Century Wrestling Alliance. On March 25, 1994 the team of Vic Steamboat and Ray Odyssey defeated Double Trouble to end their title run. In 1994 the team worked as \"the Trouble Makers\" with Val being known as Chaos and Tony working as Mayhem. Their final match in the CWA came on December 12, 1994 when they defeated Alex Shane & Cherokee Renegade in Elizabethton, Tennessee.\n\nIn 1995 Val worked for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), known as Big Val. His run was short lived, losing matches to Mikey Whipwreck and Hack Meyers. He was one of the founding members of a tag team with JT Smith, which would later evolve into The Full Blooded Italians group.\n\nAfter his ECW Run Val briefly held the CWA New England Heavyweight Championship, winning it from and losing it back to Tony Rumble.\n\nVal Puccio joined NWA New England, wrestling under the moniker of \"Punisher\" losing to The Mercenary on May 28 in Somerville, Massachusetts. He also faced Iron Fist while in the promotion.\n\nPuccio's battles against obesity have been chronicled on the TLC series \"Inside the Brookhaven Obesity Clinic\", where he was a patient. Puccio died on January 7, 2011. His brother Tony made the announcement on Facebook. He was 45. His death is thought to have been caused by his obesity.\n\n\n\n"}

After a brief involvement with professional football and a year in national service, he became a teacher.\n\nHe became chairman of the Manchester Left Club, and the editor of the Labour Party's \"Northern Voice\" newspaper. Gradually he tired of political journalism, began writing plays, and was eventually commissioned by Tony Garnett to provide a script for \"The Wednesday Play\" (BBC, 1964–70). The play, \"The Love Maniac\", was about a teacher, but even though Garnett took the commission with him when he moved to London Weekend Television and formed Kestrel Productions, it was never produced.\n\nBuoyed by Garnett's enthusiasm and influenced by the Paris events of May 1968, he wrote \"Occupations\", a stage play about the Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci and the Fiat factory occupations of 1920s Italy. The play had been submitted to the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) as early as 1964, but had then been rejected as being \"too controversial\". Following its premiere in Manchester the previous year, the eventual RSC production in 1971 of \"Occupations\", Griffiths first full-length stage play, was directed by Buzz Goodbody. Intending to affect \"bourgeois theatre\" with his viewpoint, Griffiths has described his approach as being \"committed to analysing Marxism and to condemn Stalinism without discrediting socialism in the eyes of the world\".\n\nThe play soon brought him to the attention of Kenneth Tynan, the literary manager of the National Theatre Company who promptly commissioned Griffiths to write the play that became \"The Party\". This critique of the British revolutionary left featured the National's artistic director Laurence Olivier in his last stage role as the Glaswegian Trotskyist John Tagg. Griffiths had by now begun to write television plays, such as \"All Good Men\" (\"Play for Today\", BBC, 31 January 1974) and \"Through the Night\" (2 December 1975). Influenced by the experience of his wife, the latter is concerned with a woman's treatment for breast cancer. In between these two plays came \"Absolute Beginners\" (BBC, 19 April 1974), in the series \"Fall of Eagles\", which presents a version of events in 1903 involving Lenin and Trotsky. He developed a series about parliamentary democracy, \"Bill Brand\", which was first shown by ITV in the summer of 1976.\n\nDespite his considerable success in the theatre, he said of his work as a television dramatist in 1976: \"I simply cannot understand socialist playwrights who do not devote most of their time to television... [t]hat if for every \"Sweeney\" that went out, a \"Bill Brand\" went out, there would be a real struggle for the popular imagination... [a]nd people would be free to make liberating choices about where reality lies.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Griffiths had continued to write for the theatre with \"Comedians\" commissioned by the Nottingham Playhouse. The premiere production of the play was directed by Richard Eyre, then artistic director of the Nottingham theatre, and was first performed on 20 February 1975. \"Comedians\" is set in a Manchester night-school, where a group of budding comics gather for a final briefing before performing to an agent from London. The play is set in real time, i.e. as the real time is 7.27, the clock on the wall of the school room also says 7.27. It subsequently transferred to Broadway, and was later adapted for television by Eyre while he was responsible for \"Play for Today\".\n\nGriffiths' reputation at the time was such that Warren Beatty asked him to write a screenplay for a project about the US revolutionary John Reed, which eventually became the Oscar-winning film \"Reds\" (1981), but Griffiths departed from the project before the script was completed and estimates that he had written only 45% of the script for the finished film.\n\nGriffiths continued to work in the theatre, gaining success with the touring production of \"Oi for England\" (ITV, 17 April 1982). His television play, \"Country\" (BBC, 20 October 1981), set just before the Labour victory at the 1945 general election is \"a not wholly unsympathetic study of a Tory family\". He wrote the television serial, \"The Last Place on Earth\" (ITV, 1985), the screenplay for \"Fatherland\" (1986) for director Ken Loach, and the play \"Piano\" (1990), an adaptation of a film.\n\nGriffiths's \"Food for Ravens\" (BBC, 15 November 1997), was commissioned to mark the 100th anniversary of Aneurin Bevan's birth, but at one point the BBC decided not to network the play, and instead restrict it to Wales. Only a newspaper campaign led by Griffiths and the leading actor Brian Cox caused the BBC to relent, and it was finally shown in a late-night slot on BBC2.\n\nIn November 2008 Griffiths participated in a discussion on “The Writer and Revolution” with the World Socialist Web Site's arts editor David Walsh at the University of Manchester. In 2009 he completed the play \"\".\n\nHe participated in the Bush Theatre's 2011 project \"Sixty-Six Books\", for which he wrote a piece based on a book of the King James Bible.\n\n"}

FC Köln's youth system, and made his debut in the Bundesliga on 22 February 1986 at not yet 19, in a 1–3 away loss against FC Bayern Munich. From the 1987–88 season onwards, he became the club's undisputed starter – as successor of Harald Schumacher in both 1.

The plot concerns Reno Miller, a struggling artist in New York City, turning insane from stress and killing derelicts with a power drill.\n\nThe film was on a list of \"video nasties\" in the United Kingdom, resulting the film banned from 1984 (due to new censorship laws) until 1999, when a cut version was approved for an 18 (years of age) certificate. The full uncut version was finally passed by the BBFC in November 2002. On 10 June 2010 it was re-released as video on demand (VOD).\n\nThe film is now in the public domain.\n\nArtist Reno Miller (Abel Ferrara) and his girlfriend Carol enter a small Catholic church, where he approaches an elderly bearded man (revealed as Reno's estranged derelict father) kneeling at the pulpit. The derelict seizes Reno's hand, causing him and Carol to flee from the church, unknown to him that the derelict contained a paper with Reno's information, requesting a meeting with him. Reno denies knowing who the derelict was.\n\nLater, at his apartment, Reno receives a large Con-Ed electricity bill, the phone bill and cannot pay his rent. He shares an apartment with Carol, a former flight attendant, and her drug-addicted lover Pamela, in a derelict-filled neighbourhood in Union Square. Reno visits Dalton, an art gallery owner, and tells him that he is currently painting a masterpiece. Reno asks for a week's extension and a loan of $500 to cover the rent; however, Dalton refuses, saying that he has already lent enough money to Reno. However, if Reno finishes a satisfactory painting in one week, Dalton will buy it for the necessary amount.\n\nThe following day, a No Wave band named the Roosters begin practising their music in a nearby apartment, in which the music makes Reno unnerved and frustrated. At 2:00 in the morning, Reno becomes more agitated from the Roosters' music while painting. After seeing his own image saturated in blood, Reno walks the streets in the dark. He sees an elderly derelict sleeping in a garbage-strewn alley, where he grabs the bum and begins ranting. Reno ducks with the bum into the alley where they see a small group of teenage gang members chasing another homeless bum down the street. When the gang members are gone from sight, Reno drops the bum to the ground and walks away, vowing that he will not end up like a derelict.\n\nThe next day, Reno complains about the Roosters to their landlord. However, the landlord refuses to act because the music does not bother him. He gives Reno a skinned rabbit for dinner, but instead demands the rent money. Reno takes the rabbit home and repeatedly stabs it while preparing it. During a brief reprieve from the music, Reno mentally hears voices calling his name and sees an image of an eyeless Carol. That night, Reno leaves outside and armed with a power drill connected to a portable battery pack. He discovers another derelict inside an abandoned building and brutally kills him. The following evening, Reno, Carol and Pamela see Tony Coca-Cola and the Roosters at a nightclub. As the Roosters play, Reno becomes irritated by the music and crowd and leaves while Carol and Pamela dance and kiss.\n\nReno returns to his apartment, grabs his drill and goes out on a killing spree. Throughout the night, Reno kills a number of homeless bums all over the city before returning home to sleep. Later, Tony visits Reno's apartment and asks Reno to paint a portrait of him, in which Tony agrees to pose for Reno's demand of $500 rent bill. As Reno paints, Tony poses by playing his guitar and kissing Pamela. A derelict in a nearby alley (upset by the noise) is later attacked and killed by Reno. Afterwards, Reno completes his painting, where he then wakes and notifies Pamela and Carol.\n\nThe next day, Reno and Carol show the painting to Dalton who leaves after declaring it \"unacceptable\" and Carol yells at Reno for sitting with a blank facial expression, resulting her leaving Reno for her ex-husband Stephen by the next morning. That evening, Reno calls Dalton and invites him to see another painting. When Dalton arrives as the Roosters are practising, a dressed-up Reno kills him with his drill. After visiting the Roosters, Pamela returns to the apartment where, upon the discovery of Dalton's body inside, she flees into the hallway before Reno grabs her. Pamela's fate is left ambiguous.\n\nAcross town, Carol is back with Stephen at his apartment. She takes a shower while Stephen prepares tea. Reno enters the apartment, kills Stephen, and then hides his body behind a kitchen counter. Carol, exiting from her shower, walks to the bedroom where Reno hides under the bed covers. She turns off the lights, gets into bed, and tells Stephen to \"come here...\"; The film suddenly ends, leaving Carol's ultimate fate unknown.\n\n\n\"The Driller Killer\" is a low-budget, independent feature, with a cast of unknown actors, produced by Ferrara's own Navaron Films company 1977–78 filmed on 16mm film and utilised Ferrara's Union Square apartment and adjacent streets as locations. It features many of the elements that became trademarks of Ferrara's later films including Catholic iconography, lesbian scenes, gritty urban locations filmed at night, an eclectic soundtrack combining punk rock and Bach, scenes of extreme violence and a religious theme of redemption, salvation and damnation. The punk rock band in the movie reflects contemporary New York punk bands such as the New York Dolls and Television.\n\nIn the \"Driller Killer\" trailer, Reno is heard to say a line from a scene that does not appear in the finished movie: \"It's just a window, Dalton.\"\n\nAs a final footnote in the film's history, when Arrow Films was preparing the film for re-release (the edition came out in November 2016), they discovered that the print they had was five minutes longer than any previous release on the film. They contacted Ferrara, who confirmed that it was a pre-release version, and that he had intentionally removed the footage prior to the release of the theatrical version. Arrow obtained permission to include this version as an extra in their release. The additional five minutes are all in the first half of the film and appear at seven points, including a shot of a zeppelin lasting just a few seconds, a brief lesbian shower scene, and an argument scene lasting a full two-and-a-half minutes. Most of the new footage relates to the characters' development and backstory.\n\nThe film was released theatrically in America without controversy in 1979. In the United Kingdom, however, the reaction to the video release was very different. In 1982, the UK distributors of \"Driller Killer\", Vipco (Video Instant Picture Company) took out full page advertisements in a number of movie magazines showing the video's violently explicit cover, depicting a man being drilled through the forehead by the Driller Killer. The tagline for the advertising and video box was: \"There are those who kill violently.\"\n\nThe advertising resulted in a large number of complaints to the Advertising Standards Agency, and opposition to the film from the press and elsewhere; however, it seems that very few of the complainants ever saw the film but based their opinion on the poster and title.\n\nThe film was lumped together with other \"video nasties\" released at the time and a vociferous campaign was launched by the press to ban them all. \"Driller Killer\" was added to the list of banned UK films on 4 July 1983, just a year after its release date. According to Mike Bor, the Principal Examiner at the British Board of Film Classification, \"\"The Driller Killer\" was almost single-handedly responsible for the Video Recordings Act 1984\" under which it and others of the \"video nasties\" released at the time were banned in the U.K. According to Brad Stevens, author of a biography on Abel Ferrara, the banning of the film was \"almost entirely due to the cover of the video.\" The film was classified R 18+ in Australia by the Australian Classification Board and released uncut on home video on April 29, 1985. It was released on DVD twice in the country: first by Umbrella Entertainment and again on August 9, 2013, when it was re-rated MA 15+.\n\nThe film was not officially released uncut in the UK until 2002.\n\nReviewers had pointed out that the film was not as violent as the original VHS cover suggested and more of a psychodrama.\n\n\"The Driller Killer\" has a 69% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews; the average rating is 6.06/10.\n\nIn 2007, it was announced that the film would be remade by British film maker Andrew Jones. It was reported that this new version of the film would also feature many unusual cameos and an original musical score. The remake would have moved the setting from New York to London and starred David Hess. Andrew Jones \ncontacted Baybi Day to help co-produce and have a small acting role in the remake of \"Driller Killer\". The title of the remake was designated \"Driller Killer Redux\". The project came to a halt after a financial deal between the executive producers and the two people who held the rights to the original movie could not be reached.\n\n\n"}

The group ranges in age from Paleocene to Eocene and is in Texas subdivided into the Calvert Bluff, Simsboro and Hooper Formations, and in Alabama into the Nanafalia and Hatchetigbee Formations. Other subdivisions are the Lower, Middle and Upper Wilcox Subgroups, and the Carrizo and Indio Formations.\n\nThe group comprises mostly mudstone with secondary sandstone and lignite beds, ironstone concretions, as well as siltstones, conglomerates and limestones. The total thickness is about .\n\nSandstone modal compositions and detrital zircon U‐Pb analyses of the Wilcox Group indicate long‐distance sediment transport from primarily volcanic and basement sources to the west, northwest, and southwest. The Wilcox Group represents the earliest series of major post‐Cretaceous pulses of sand deposition along the western margin of the Gulf of Mexico. Laramide basement uplifts have long been held to be the source of Wilcox sediments, implying that initiation of basement uplift was the driving factor for the transition from carbonate sedimentation to clastic deposition. Zircon age‐spectra for the sandstones of the Wilcox Group reveal a complex grain assemblage derived from Laramide uplifted crystalline blocks of the central and southern Rocky Mountains, the Cordilleran arc of western North America, and arc‐related extrusive and intrusive igneous rocks of northern Mexico.\n\nZircon ages also suggest possible recycling of older sediment through uplift related to accretion of arc terranes along the westernmost North America, but that recycling of Cordilleran foreland basin sediments was not a major contributor. Comparison of Upper and Lower Wilcox zircon age-spectra indicate that Lower Wilcox sediments are richer in arc and volcanic material, whereas Upper Wilcox sediments are richer in basement material. Regional trends in detrital zircon age‐spectra indicate that Upper Wilcox sediments are moderately homogeneous over the region studied, whereas the Lower Wilcox shows significant heterogeneity. The drainage area for the Gulf of Mexico during the Paleocene and Eocene was larger than previously thought, encompassing not only the Laramide basement uplifts, but the volcanic province of northern Mexico and possibly Cordilleran tectonic regions along the westernmost North America.\n\nThe Wilcox Group comprises important source and reservoir rocks in the Gulf of Mexico Basin. Structural and geochemical evidence indicates that hydrocarbons found in Wilcox reservoirs such as the Wilds sandstones were emplaced by vertical migration along wrench faults and associated fracture zones from underlying Cretaceous and Jurassic source rocks.\n\n\n"}

He stays at the home of Gordon Whitfield, claiming to be a cousin of Bridget Conway, Whitfield's fiancée, and the cousin of his own good friend. He and Conway receive the assistance of Honoria Waynflete, a woman whom they believe may know the person behind the deaths. He talks with villagers to learn the stories of the recent murders, including Mr Abbot, the solicitor who fired Tommy Pierce from his service; the Reverend Mr Wake, local preacher; Mr Ellsworthy, an antique shop owner who appears to be mentally unstable, and Dr Thomas, Humbleby's younger partner. People in the village view the deaths as accidents. Amy Gibbs died after confusing her cough remedy with hat paint in the dark, Tommy Pierce died from falling off the library roof while cleaning the windows, Harry Carter fell from a bridge while drunk and drowned in the mud, and Humbleby died from a cut that became infected. Luke learns that Mrs Lydia Horton was another victim of these accidents—she was recovering from acute gastritis and was getting better before she had a sudden relapse and died.\n\nLuke believes Ellsworthy to be the killer because of his mental instability. Seeing Ellsworthy return home with blood on his hands adds to this image. Later on in that day, Luke and Miss Waynflete witness Whitfield arguing with his chauffeur, Rivers, who had taken Whitfield's Rolls-Royce for a joyride. Luke finds Rivers dead, hit by a decorative stone. Luke and Bridget realise that they are in love with each other, and Bridget tells Gordon of her decision to break off the engagement. Speaking with Luke, Gordon makes an odd statement. He claims that God kills people that do him harm, dispensing divine justice upon wrongdoers. Whitfield mentions that Mrs Horton had argued with him, Tommy Pierce did mocking impressions of him, Harry Carter shouted at him while drunk, Amy Gibbs was impertinent to him, Humbleby disagreed with him on the village water supply, and Rivers used his car without permission and then spoke disrespectfully to him; and all of them died soon afterwards. Whitfield predicts that Luke and Bridget, having wronged him, will soon meet their fates too. \n\nLuke changes his mind about who is responsible for the deaths, considering Whitfield as the murderer. He consults Miss Waynflete, who confirms his suspicions, and tells him of how she knew he was insane: when they were younger, Waynflete and Whitfield had been engaged to be married. But one evening, Whitfield killed the bird that she kept as a pet, with the appearance that he enjoyed doing it. She ended their engagement.\n\nLuke and Bridget decide that Bridget will leave Whitfield's estate to stay at Honoria Waynflete's house. Luke collects their luggage and prepares to leave, while Bridget and Honoria take a walk in the woods. Honoria reveals herself to be the murderer. During her engagement to Whitfield, Honoria had killed her own pet bird after it bit her, which prompted Gordon to abandon the engagement. She vowed revenge on Gordon, and decided to set him up for crimes he did not commit. She encouraged him in the belief that God exacted immediate retribution from those who disrespected him. \n\nHonoria poisoned the tea for Lydia Horton, while encouraging others to believe the problem was in the grapes sent by Whitfield. Honoria killed Amy by swapping the bottles around in the night and locking the door from the outside using pincers. She killed Carter by pushing him off the bridge on the day he had a row with Whitfield, and she likewise pushed Tommy Pierce out of the window while he was working. Whitfield had been the one to assign Tommy to this job.\n\nHonoria sees that Lavinia Pinkerton realised she is the killer, and that Humbleby would be her next victim. Honoria follows Lavinia into London and then pushes her in front of a passing car. Honoria frames Whitfield by telling a witness that she saw the registration number of Whitfield's Rolls-Royce. After inviting Humbleby round to her house, she cut his hand with scissors. She then applied a dressing to the wound, a dressing with pus seeping from her cat's ear; Humbleby dies a few days later from blood infection. After witnessing Rivers being sacked, Honoria hits him with a sandbag and caves his skull in with the stone pineapple. \n\nHonoria drugs Bridget's tea and takes her into the woods, where the two of them began talking. Bridget does not drink the tea and is ready for what comes. Honoria reveals a knife covered in Whitfield's fingerprints, and informs Bridget that she will kill her and leave the knife at the scene. Further, Honoria arranges for Whitfield to be seen walking alone through the area where Bridget's body will be. Instead, Bridget fights with Honoria. Luke realises that Honoria is the murderer and rescues Bridget. Bridget and Luke leave the village to live together as a married couple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Times Literary Supplement\" of 10 June 1939 published a review of the book by Maurice Percy Ashley, together with \"And Death Came Too\" by Richard Hull which began \"A week in which new novels by Mr Hull and Mrs Christie appear should be a red letter week for connoisseurs of detective fiction. One must, however, reluctantly confess that neither of them is fully up to standard.\"\n\nAfter considering in isolation \"And Death Came Too\", Mr. Ashley turned his attention to \"Murder is Easy\" and started, \"Mrs Christie has abandoned M. Hercule Poirot in her new novel, but it must be confessed that his understudy, Luke Fitzwilliam, a retired policeman from the Mayang States is singularly lacking in 'little grey matter.' Poirot may have recently become, with advancing years, a trifle staid, but absence makes the heart grow fonder of him.\" After outlining the basics of the plot and the romantic interests of the main character, Mr. Ashley concluded, \"He (Luke) is less effective a detective than as a lover, which is not surprising since neither he nor the reader is provided with any clear clues pointing to the fantastically successful murderer. The love interest scarcely compensates for the paucity of detection and the characters verge on caricature; nor is Fitzwilliam able to recapture vividly enough the circumstances of the earlier murders.\"\n\nIn \"The New York Times Book Review\" for 24 September 1939, Kay Irvin said the book was \"one of Agatha Christie's best mystery novels, a story fascinating in its plot, clever and lively in its characters and brilliant in its technique.\" She concluded, \"The story's interest is unflagging, and the end brings excitement as well as surprise.\"\n\nWilliam Blunt in \"The Observer\" of 4 June 1939 raised a question regarding Christie's abilities to write non-crime fiction, which demonstrates that her nom-de-plume identity of Mary Westmacott was not yet public knowledge: \"I should hate to have to state on oath which I thought was Agatha Christie's best story, but I do think I can say that this is well up in the first six. The humour and humanity of its detail raise a question which only one person can give an answer. Agatha Christie has grown accustomed to working her embroidery on a background of black. Could she, or could she not, leave death and detection out, and embroider as well on green? I believe she is one of the few detective novelists who could. If she would let herself try, just for fun. I believe it would be very good fun for other people, too.\"\n\nE.R. Punshon in \"The Guardian\"s issue of 11 July 1939 said that, \"Readers may miss the almost supernatural cunning of Poirot, but then if Luke also depended on the famous 'little grey cells' he would be merely another Poirot instead of having his own blundering, straightforward, yet finally effective methods.\" Mr. Punshon summed up by saying that the story, \"must be counted as yet another proof of Mrs. Christie's inexhaustible ingenuity.\"\n\nMary Dell of the \"Daily Mirror\", wrote on 8 June 1939, \"It'll keep you guessing will this latest book from the pen of one of the best thriller writers ever.\"\n\nAn unnamed reviewer in the \"Toronto Daily Star\" of 2 December 1939 said, \"An anemic thread of romance threatens to sever on occasion but the mystery is satisfying and full of suspense.\"\n\nRobert Barnard: \"Archetypal Mayhem Parva story, with all the best ingredients: Cranford-style village with 'about six women to every man'; doctors, lawyers, retired colonels and antique dealers; suspicions of black magic; and, as optional extra ingredient, a memorably awful press lord. And of course a generous allowance of sharp old spinsters. Shorter than most on detection, perhaps because the detection is, until the end, basically amateur. One of the classics.\"\n\n\nThe book was first serialised in the US in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" in seven parts from 19 November (Volume 211, Number 21) to 31 December 1938 (Volume 211, Number 27) under the title \"Easy to Kill\" with illustrations by Henry Raleigh. The UK serialisation was in twenty-three parts in the \"Daily Express\" from Tuesday, 10 January, to Friday, 3 February 1939, as \"Easy to Kill\". All the instalments carried an illustration by \"Prescott\". This version did not contain any chapter divisions.\n\nAdapted into a television film in the United States in 1982 with Bill Bixby (Luke), Lesley-Anne Down (Bridget), Olivia de Havilland (Honoria) and Helen Hayes (Lavinia), and later for the stage by Clive Exton in 1993. In this adaptation, Luke is not a retired policeman but a professor from MIT on vacation.\n\nA 2009 adaptation, with the inclusion of Miss Marple (played by Julia McKenzie), was included in the fourth series of \"Agatha Christie's Marple\"; it deviated significantly from the novel by removing some of the characters in it, while adding new ones and changing those left in. New subplots were introduced, and the murderer's motive was changed:\n\nA BBC Radio 4 adaptation in three parts by Joy Wilkinson and directed by Mary Peate, with Patrick Baladi as Luke Fitzwilliam, Lydia Leonard as Briget Conway, Michael Cochrane as Lord Whitfield, Marcia Warren as Honoria Waynflete, Marlene Sidaway as Miss Pinkerton and Patrick Brennan as Billy Bones/Rivers.\n\n"}

{"id": "2255162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255162", "title": "The Body in the Library", "text": "The Body in the Library\n\nThe Body in the Library is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first published in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in February 1942 and in UK by the Collins Crime Club in May of the same year. The US edition retailed at $2.00 and the UK edition at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6). The novel features her fictional amateur detective, Miss Marple.\n\nThe maid at Gossington Hall wakes Mrs Bantry by saying, “There is a body in the library!” Dolly Bantry then wakes her husband, Colonel Arthur Bantry to go downstairs. He finds the dead body of a young woman on the hearth rug in the library, dressed up and with platinum blonde hair. The Colonel calls the police, and Mrs Bantry calls her old friend, Miss Marple. The police investigators include Colonel Melchett and Inspector Slack.\n\nTrying to identify this dead young woman, Melchett heads to the nearby cottage of Basil Blake, but Dinah Lee, a platinum blonde, arrives while Colonel Melchett is present, very much alive. Dr Haydock’s autopsy reveals that the young woman, healthy but not fully matured, died between 10 pm and 12 midnight the previous evening, had been drugged and then strangled, and was not molested. Miss Marple notices that the appearance of this girl is not right, from her fingernails to her old dress. She shares this with Dolly.\n\nHotel guest Conway Jefferson reports Ruby Keene, an 18-year-old dancer at the Majestic Hotel in Danemouth as missing. Josie Turner, employee at the hotel, identifies the body as her cousin Ruby. Guests saw Ruby as late as 11 pm dancing with George Bartlett, but Ruby did not appear for her dance demonstration at midnight. Conway tells police he has revised his will to favour Ruby, until the legal adoption is completed.\n\nDolly and Miss Marple move to the Majestic to investigate further. Conway calls Sir Henry Clithering to join the investigation; Sir Henry sees Miss Marple at the hotel and in turn invites her to investigate.\n\nConway made large financial settlements for his children at the time each married. Then his wife, son and daughter were killed in an aeroplane crash eight years earlier. The three grieving survivors made up a household. They were playing bridge that evening with Josie. Police rule out the son-in-law and daughter-in-law, thinking each one is well set financially. Both in-laws are short of money, as Slack’s investigation and Adelaide’s conversation with Dolly reveal.\n\nBartlett's burned-out car is found with a charred corpse inside. From one shoe and one button, the corpse is identified as 16-year-old Girl Guide Pamela Reeves, reported missing by her parents the night before.\n\nThe police ask Miss Marple to interview the other girls at the Guides event, and ask Sir Henry to question Conway's valet, Edwards. Miss Marple learns from friend Florence that Pamela had been approached by a film producer and offered a screen test that evening, which was why she did not go directly home. Edwards reports that he saw a snapshot of Basil Blake fall out of Ruby's handbag while she was with Conway, which points to Blake. Slack had already found the hearth rug from the Blake home dumped.\n\nMiss Marple knows who the murderer is, and seeks proof of her deduction. She visits Dinah Lee; Basil returns home, and he reveals how he found the corpse on the hearth rug around midnight when he came home rather drunk after a party. He moved the corpse to the Bantry home, not liking Bantry much. He did not kill the girl. The police arrest him.\n\nBack at the hotel, Miss Marple asks the Bantrys to find a marriage record at Somerset House. She asks Sir Henry to approach Conway; he agrees to tell Mark and Adelaide that he will change his will the next day, leaving his money to a hostel in London. Sir Henry alerts the police, and shows the marriage record for Mark and Josie. At 3 am, an intruder, Josie Turner, enters Conway’s bedroom, and is caught in the act by the police before she can harm Conway with the syringe filled with digitalin.\n\nMiss Marple explains her process to Conway and the police. The body in the library was Pamela Reeves, made up to look like more or less like Ruby, with her bitten fingernails a jarring note. Ruby was the one burned in the car. Thus the alibis at the hotel were useless. Miss Marple did not believe the identification by Josie (“people are far too trusting for this wicked world”) and sensed a plan gone awry. \n\nShe suspected that Mark and Josie were married. Besides wanting Conway dead, upon learning that Conway planned to adopt Ruby, they made the double murder plan. Mark lured Pamela to the hotel for the fictitious screen test. Josie dressed her, dyed her hair and made her up to resemble Ruby, then drugged her. During the bridge play, Mark took a break, taking Pamela’s body to Blake's hearth rug, where he strangled her with her belt. Just before midnight, when Ruby went up to change for the exhibition dance, Josie followed her and killed her by injection or a blow. After the midnight dance, she took Ruby, dressed in Pamela’s clothes, in Bartlett's car to the quarry where she set fire to the car. During the police interrogation, Mark breaks down and confesses all the details.\n\nAdelaide says she has agreed to marry her paramour, Hugo, which pleases Conway. His new will settles cash on Adelaide and leaves the rest to her son Peter.\n\n\nIn her \"Author's Foreword\", Christie describes \"the body in the library\" as a cliché of detective fiction. She states that when writing her own variation on this theme, she decided that the library should be a completely conventional one while the body would be a highly improbable and sensational one.\n\nAnother example of this cliché was included in the first episode of the second series (\"And the Moonbeams Kiss the Sea\") of the television series \"Inspector Lewis,\" the body of a handyman is found in the Bodleian Library. DS James Hathaway comments to DI Robbie Lewis, \"You realise what we've got, don't you, sir. ... The body in the library.\"\n\nYet more recently, in Philip Pullman's novel \"La Belle Sauvage\", published in 2017, the protagonist borrows a book titled \"The Body in the Library\".\n\nIn light of these remarks, this novel can be considered a conscious reworking of the genre.\n\nMaurice Willson Disher of \"The Times Literary Supplement\" was impressed in his review of 16 May 1942 with the female view of life injected into the solution of the crimes. \"Some devoted souls may sigh for Hercule Poirot, but there are bound to be others who will be glad to find his place taken in the 'new Agatha Christie' by Miss Marple. What this relief signifies is that professional detectives are no match for elderly spinsters (not all so elderly), with some training in looking under the antimacassar, who are now very much in fashion. Even while making full allowance for this we find it hard not to be impressed by old-maid logic. When Miss Marple says, 'The dress was \"all\" wrong,' she is plainly observing facts hidden from the masculine eye – facts which are of a very lively interest. \"The Body in the Library\" should turn Hendon College co-educational.\"\n\nMaurice Richardson was not as impressed with Christie's efforts as usual in his 17 May 1942 review in \"The Observer\" when he concluded, \"Ingenious, of course, but interest is rather diffuse and the red herrings have lost their phosphorescence.\"\n\nAn unnamed reviewer in the \"Toronto Daily Star\" (21 March 1942) wrote that \"It doesn't take long to read this one, but the two killings in it are made so mysterious that you will not want to lay the book down until the killer is caught.\" The reviewer concludes, \"Police do a lot of probing, but it is the shrewd reasoning – intuition perhaps – of Jane Marple that finds the missing link and discloses a diabolical plot.\"\n\nRobert Barnard had a positive view of this novel, writing in 1990. He calls the plot situation classic rather than cliché. It was a \"Bravura performance on a classic situation.\" The shift of locations of action, from Miss Marple's village to a seaside resort hotel, were good for the story, \"St Mary Mead regulars figure in the case, pleasantly diversified by fashionable seaside hotel guests and the film crowd.\" The question he raised involves the likelihood of the crimes and the manner of solving them, which he found better than a mystery written over 30 years later by another author, saying that \"If you think what happens to the body after death is unlikely, try the more 'realistic' P.D. James' \"An Unsuitable Job for a Woman\".\"\n\nIn Chapter 8 the author gives herself a namecheck from the mouth of the young boy, Peter Carmody. Explaining that he enjoys reading detective stories, Peter says that he has the autographs of Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, John Dickson Carr and H. C. Bailey.\n\nIn Chapter 9 Colonel Melchett states that \"there's still one thing to be done. \"Cherchez l'homme\".\" It is referred to as a joke in the book, and is possibly a reference to Hercule Poirot, Christie's other famous sleuth. However, it is more likely a reference to the popular phrase '\"cherchez la femme\"', meaning that there is frequently a woman behind a man's behaviour and motives in detective stories; since in this novel the victim was a girl, who was presumed to have a male lover, the phrase was changed jokingly by the detective.\n\nWhile explaining how she concluded who the murderers were and how the widowed Mr Jefferson became so quickly enamoured of a girl, knowing so little of her, Miss Marple mentioned the old story \"The King and the Beggar-maid\" as a model for that sort of instant emotional reaction. All the other characters in the novel were found to act like someone she knew from life in her village, including Sir Henry.\n\nIn Christie's \"Cards on the Table\", published six years earlier, Anne Meredith knows Ariadne Oliver as the writer of a book called \"The Body in the Library\".\n\nThe 1984 television film \"The Body in the Library\" was part of the BBC series of \"Miss Marple\", with Joan Hickson making the first of her acclaimed appearances in the role of Jane Marple. The adaptation was transmitted in three parts between 26–28 December 1984, and only had a few changes made to it:\n\nA second adaptation of the novel was made in 2004 by ITV, as part of their ongoing \"Agatha Christie's Marple\" series. This adaptation starred Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple, James Fox as Colonel Bantry, Joanna Lumley as Dolly Bantry, Ian Richardson as Conway Jefferson, and Jamie Theakston as Mark Gaskell. While this adaptation was largely faithful to the original novel, there were several changes:\n\nA radio adaptation was produced for BBC Radio 4 in 1999.\n\nIt has since been rebroadcast 15 times on BBC Radio 7 and its successor, BBC Radio 4 Extra.\n\nThe cast list featured June Whitfield as Miss Marple, Richard Todd as Colonel Melchett, Pauline Jameson as Dolly Bantry, Jack Watling as Colonel Bantry, Graham Crowden as Sir Henry Clithering, and Ben Crowe as George Bartlett.\n\nThe production was dramatised by Michael Bakewell and directed by Enyd Williams.\n\n\nThe novel was first serialised in the US in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" in seven parts from 10 May (Volume 213, Number 45) to 21 June 1941 (Volume 213, Number 51) with illustrations by Hy Rubin.\n\n"}

In 1988, he moved on to Norwich City, before joining Chelsea two years later. In 1993, he signed with Aston Villa and enjoyed four successful years before his transfer to Middlesbrough. His final club was West Bromwich Albion, where he retired in 2000.\n\nFollowing his retirement as a player he became a football co-commentator.\n\nTownsend was born in Maidstone, Kent, but grew up in Bexley, where he attended Upton Primary School in Bexleyheath, followed by Bexleyheath School.\n\nHe began his playing career in August 1980 with Welling United in the Athenian League, while working as a computer operator for Greenwich Borough Council in south-east London. After making 105 appearances for Welling, he was signed by Weymouth in March 1984 for £13,500.\n\nIn January 1985, he was signed by Lawrie McMenemy at Southampton for £35,000 and made his professional debut at home to Aston Villa on 20 April 1985 as Southampton qualified for Europe, only to be banned in the aftermath of the Heysel Stadium disaster.\n\nOver the next season, he was in and out of the team (then managed by Chris Nicholl) but broke his leg in a pre-season friendly against his old club Weymouth in August 1986. He fought his way back to fitness and rejoined the side the following January.\n\nIn the 1987–88 he was a virtual ever-present, playing alongside Jimmy Case and Glenn Cockerill in the Southampton midfield. He was a hard-tackling, hard-working midfielder with an eye for goal. It was a shock, therefore, when Nicholl sold him to First Division rivals Norwich City in August 1988, for a fee of £300,000.\n\nHe made his debut as a substitute against Middlesbrough on 3 September 1988, before replacing the suspended Trevor Putney for his first full appearance in a 3–1 win over \"Spurs\" on 22 October. He retained his place in the Norwich midfield and ended the season with 36 league appearances (5 as substitute) with five goals. He also made six FA Cup appearances with two goals against Port Vale in the Third Round on 7 January 1989. Under manager Dave Stringer, he was a member of the \"Canaries\"' 1988–89 side that finished fourth in the top flight and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup. At the season's end, Townsend was shortlisted for the PFA Players' Player of the Year award, which was won by Mark Hughes.\n\nNorwich made a handsome profit when they let Townsend join Chelsea for £1,200,000 in July 1990.\n\nAfter making a total of 138 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 12 goals but winning no trophies (they never finished higher than 11th in the league while he was there), he transferred to Aston Villa in July 1993 for £2.1million.\n\nHe finally won some silverware when Villa won the 1994 League Cup, beating Manchester United 3–1. He captained Villa when they reclaimed the trophy in 1996 with a 3–0 victory over Leeds United.\n\nIn August 1997, just after the start of the 1997–98 season, he transferred to Bryan Robson's Middlesbrough for £500,000 having made 134 league appearances for \"the Villans\", scoring eight league goals.\n\nHe made 37 appearances in his first season on Teesside, scoring twice as \"Boro\"' won promotion to the Premier League. In the 1998–99 season, he formed a useful partnership with Paul Gascoigne as Middlesbrough finished comfortably in mid-table in their first season back in the Premiership.\n\nIn the following season, he found it harder to get into the first team and on 17 September 1999 he moved down a division to West Bromwich Albion for £50,000. Townsend's high wage demands prevented a move back to Norwich or a loan spell with non-league Boston United.\n\nIn his one season at West Bromwich Albion he only made 17 league appearances before a recurrent knee injury forced his retirement in July 2000, after a season in which Albion narrowly avoided relegation to Division Two.\n\nOn 21 April 2016, Townsend joined Bolton Wanderers as a consultant.\n\nHis contribution to Norwich's successful season saw Andy selected for the Republic of Ireland, making his debut against France in February 1989. He qualified for Ireland due to his Irish family heritage.'\n\nHe played in the next year's World Cup, in Italy, where he played in all five of Ireland's matches. They reached the quarter-finals, the country's strongest ever campaign. The Irish drew their three group matches – against England, Egypt and Netherlands. Scoring a penalty in the shoot-out with Romania, his country were eventually sunk by a Salvatore Schillaci goal for the hosts. They had conceded just three goals in those five games.\n\nHe was captain of the Ireland squad for the 1994 World Cup. All four teams of Group E finished on four points, they got their revenge on the Italians, but were defeated by Mexico and drew with Norway. Ireland lost 2–0 to the Dutch at the Citrus Bowl in the knock-out stage.\n\nOn 22 March 2015, Townsend was inducted into the FAI Hall of Fame.\n\nTownsend's most prominent role was as part of ITV Sport's live Champions League, FA Cup and England internationals coverage. He took over from Ron Atkinson as the channel's lead co-commentator, forming a long-running partnership with main commentator Clive Tyldesley, as well as appearing as a studio pundit.

{"id": "2255164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255164", "title": "Editing of anime in distribution", "text": "Editing of anime in distribution\n\nThe content of Japanese animation (anime) is frequently edited by distributors, both for its release in Japan or during subsequent localizations. This happens for a variety for reasons, including translation, censorship, and remastering.\n\nUnder article 175 of the Penal Code of Japan, material containing indecent images are prohibited. However the laws date back to 1907 and were unchanged during the process of updating the Japanese constitution in 1947. Over time and due to changing tastes the acceptable standards have become blurred. The display of pubic hair was prohibited until 1991 leading to series such as \"Lolita Anime\" and \"Cream Lemon\" using the sexualization of children as a loophole. The use of tentacles in series such as \"Urotsukidōji\" enabled the creators to avoid a ban on the display of genitals. In other cases, the content is self censored through the use of blurring and black dots. When the censorship is removed for overseas release, the basic animation underneath is revealed, leading to concerns over the sexualization of children in those markets.\n\n\"Cowboy Bebop\" and \"Gantz\" are examples of titles that received edited broadcasts and were later released as unedited home releases. Episodes of shows such as \"Mr Osomatsu\" have been edited for repeats and home releases.\nDue to the lack of a formal and consistent age rating system in the United States of America, age ratings for anime have created several problems. Blockbuster Video marked all anime titles as unsuitable for kids, leading them to appear as R-18 on their computer system. Publishers began using their own age rating suggestions on their releases, however due to differences between publisher assessments and the use of TV age ratings by some this resulted in an inconsistent system.\n\nWhen Cartoon Network began to broadcast anime there were no internal standards in place for the use of overseas material. This required them to develop a set of standards and guidelines for the handling of the content. The display of alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, violence (including depictions of death, spoken references to death and dying, scenes of characters being threatened or in life-threatening situations, and depictions of suicide), gambling, blood, offensive language, offensive hand gestures, sexual content (including nudity, intercourse, innuendo, and depictions of homosexual and transsexual characters), and the mistreatment of women and minors were all deemed unacceptable as well as other situations unsuitable to a younger audience. Material for Cartoon Network was edited for TV-Y7, whereas Adult Swim content was edited for TV-14 standards. However some content that aired on Adult Swim was originally scheduled to air on Toonami and was edited accordingly. Autodesk Inferno was used to digitally edit scenes to remove blood or cover up nudity on content edited by Cartoon Network. In some cases content was edited before it was given to Cartoon Network. The editing practices evolved over time due to complaints from parents.\n\n4Kids made changes to the anime they licensed to make them \"more Western\" in order to be more accessible to children. Another reason was so that they could easily merchandise them. However, they also released uncut versions of some of those shows.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the Video Recordings Act 1984 and subsequently the Video Recordings Act 2010 make it a legal requirement for all home video media to be certified by the British Board of Film Classification. Sale or hire of unrated media is prohibited however imported media is allowed for personal use providing the content does not breach UK law. The BBFC is responsible for assigning age ratings to video content and if necessary requesting cuts and refusing certification if content fails guidelines. Examples of content deemed unacceptable include graphic violence and scenes of a sexual nature such as underage sex and sexual violence.\n\nA number of releases were substantially cut in order to pass certification including the \"Urotsukidōji\" series and \"Adventure Duo\". The \"Infernal Road\" entry in the \"Urotsukidōji\" series was delayed by the BBFC for three years and included two outright rejections until the final episode was released by itself, with the scripts for the other entries included as DVD extras. \"La Blue Girl\" was also refused a classification. \"La Blue Girl Returns\" was passed as 18 after heavy mandatory cuts of 35 minutes across 4 episodes. During the early 90s anime in the UK was subject to a negative press campaign by several newspapers as a reaction to the violence and sexualized content in many of the available titles. Publishers took advantage of this through the selected licensing of risqué anime in order to appeal to their chosen market. In 1995, 25% of anime released in the UK at that point was rated 18 and 36% was rated 15. As of 2006 the average work was passed uncut at a 12 rating. In some cases a heavier BBFC rating was actually desired by the publishers with excessive swearing deliberately inserted in order to gain a higher age rating, a process known as \"fifteening\". An example given by the BBFC was \"Patlabor\" receiving a 15 rating due to the language used, whereas it would have otherwise passed as a PG.\n\nIn 2020, the streaming of \"Interspecies Reviewers\" in Australia and New Zealand was delayed due to \"adjusting [its] sourcing of materials.\".\n\nLocalization is an essential process in releasing anime outside of Japan. It can cover a range of different processes depending on the individual title and the desired result. At its most basic level, the localization process is responsible for deciding on romanized character and term names, as well as episode titles. In other cases it may require special attention to areas such as humor where a judgement call must be made to try and retain the feeling of the source material. At its most intense it may involve editing of the content itself in order to fit a target market.\n\nIn some cases, the original Japanese music may be replaced with alternate regional music. This can be either a technical consideration caused by footage getting cut since it is synchronized with the audio on the episode master, or it can be an artistic consideration. Dubbing companies may also replace it because they want to collect royalties from new music they produced, which is not possible if the original Japanese music is retained.\n\nThe \"Pokémon\" episode \"Dennō Senshi Porygon\" was removed from all repeats and home releases of the series due to an issue during its original broadcast. It was never released in any form outside of Japan. For the North American Blu-ray release of \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" series producer Yoshiyuki Tomino removed episode 15 of the series due to its poor quality animation.\n\nThe \"Robotech\" series was created as a mix of three originally separate and unrelated series \"The Super Dimensional Fortress Macross\", \"Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross\" and \"Mospeada\". Characters were renamed and the story was adapted to create links between each of the source series. \"Battle of the Planets\" was adapted from \"Science Ninja Team Gatchaman\" with 85 of the original 106 episodes being adapted by Sandy Frank for US broadcast in 1979. Along with westernized character names, other changes included the removal of violent scenes and entirely new animation inserted in places. A new character was also created. The series was then released as \"\" by Turner Broadcasting, with fewer changes to the original Japanese version.\n\nIn some cases, the original dialogue can be replaced with a new one, or part of the dialogue can be altered, but in a few cases the original dialogue can be retained with at least one additional line. In one scene of the Hayao Miyazaki film \"Spirited Away\", the protagonist Chihiro Ogino approaches a bath house. In the original Japanese track, she does not say anything, but in the English dub released in the United States by Walt Disney Pictures, she says “It’s a bath house.” This line was added in due to many Americans being unfamiliar with bath houses, unlike in Japan, where bath houses are common. So, at least for American viewers, it was helpful for Chihiro to state what a bath house looks like.\n\nHayao Miyazaki's anime film \"Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind\" was heavily edited by New World Pictures in the mid-1980s and released as \"Warriors of the Wind\". About one-quarter of the film was cut and its storyline simplified somewhat, distorting the original's ecological and pacifist themes. Additionally, the voice actors and actresses who dubbed the English dialogue were not really informed of the film's plot. Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli were aware of this editing to the film and were extremely unhappy about it. Miyazaki has since suggested that those who have viewed the edited version should \"dismiss it from their minds.\" As a result of this experience, the studio instituted a \"no-cuts\" policy of never allowing a foreign company to edit any of its films prior to release in a new market. During the late 1990s and 2000s, Studio Ghibli has allowed its catalog to be dubbed into English by Walt Disney Pictures, on the condition that no frames were removed or airbrushed, and that the English dialogue was not significantly changed from faithful translations of the Japanese versions. \"Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind\" was re-released in its unedited form by Disney in 2005.\n\nThe \"no-cuts\" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein suggested editing \"Princess Mononoke\" to make it more marketable and avoid a PG-13 rating. In response, an unnamed Studio Ghibli producer sent him an authentic katana with a message saying \"No cuts.\" Although Studio Ghibli has not allowed Disney to cut the films themselves, some minor changes to translated dialogue have been permitted, including the removal of references to testicles in the English dub of \"Pom Poko\", replacing them with the innocuous euphemism \"raccoon pouch\".\n\n\n\n"}

It was critically detested on its theatrical release, but is now generally highly regarded among fans of underground and independent film.\n\nIt was acquired by Alamo Drafthouse Films in October 2013 and remastered in HD from the original negatives. The distributor released the film on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy in March 2014.\n\nWhile walking home from work, Thana, a mute seamstress in New York City's Garment District, is raped at gunpoint in an alley by a mysterious, masked attacker. She survives and makes her way back to her apartment, where she encounters a burglar and is raped a second time. Thana—her name an allusion to Greek god of death Thanatos—hits this second assailant with a small sculpture then bludgeons him to death with an iron, and carries his body to the bathtub. She goes to work the next day, and after encountering working with an iron, watching her boss Albert rip a shirt off a mannequin, she goes into shock state, which worries her co-workers. However, when she looks at the trash bin at her office, she decides to dismember the burglar's corpse and throw the parts away in various locations of the city.\n\nAfter being sent home, she dismembers the burglar's body, then keeps his .45 caliber pistol, puts the pieces into plastic garbage bags, and then stores them in her fridge. After cleaning her bathtub, she decides to take a shower, but as she strips, she begins to hallucinate the first attacker in the mirror grabbing her breast. This puts her into shock, and she notices that organs and body fluids from the burglar are overflowing in the drain. Her nosy neighbor, an old, recently widowed woman named Mrs. Nasone who is the landlady and owns a small dog named Phil, also starts to notice her odd behavior.\n\nOn her walk home from work the next day, Thana is noticed by a leering young man on the street while she is disposing of one of the bagged body parts; thinking that she accidentally dropped the bag, he retrieves it, frightening her. He chases her through the alleys of the city and, fearing another sexual assault, she fatally shoots him when she is cornered by him. The event furthers her impulse for vengeance. While running home from the incident, the landlady Mrs. Nasone notices she ran up the stairs violently and started throwing up. She insists in calling a doctor for Thana, and Mrs. Nasone's dog, Phil, starts to become attracted to her fridge. Thana escorts her out of her apartment while still in shock.\n\nAs the limbs start to bring the attention of the media, Albert brings her into his office and notices she hasn't been sewing enough and hasn't been feeling well lately. He decides to invite her to a Halloween party that he is throwing for work, and tells her that there will be \"many boys there [her] age\" while stroking her neck. She responds to him in writing, saying \"I'll try\". As Thana's vengeance increases, she starts regularly targeting and killing several men, such as a fashion photographer, a pimp who assaults a prostitute because of debt, several members of a gang, a Saudi Arabian businessman and his limousine driver, and even drives a recently dumped salesman to suicide after her gun jams.\n\nHer boss, Albert, notices her ditching work after going to dinner with her co-workers, resulting in her co-workers having to finish her work. However, she promises to go to the party with him in exchange for staying out of trouble for her absence. Thana notices that Mrs. Nasone's dog, Phil, is attracted to the smell of the burglar's dismembered limbs. Thana takes Phil for a walk then ties him to a post in the park. She leaves a note saying that Phil ran away but will probably find his way back home soon.\n\nWith Albert, Thana attends the costume party dressed as a nun with red lipstick. Meanwhile, Mrs. Nasone enters Thana's apartment and finds the burglar's dismembered head. She jumps to the conclusion that Thana killed her dog, and tells police that she is at a party with her co-workers. At the party, Albert takes Thana upstairs in private and tries to seduce her. In revenge for his borderline-sexual behavior towards her in the past, she shoots him. The party stops and her co-workers run upstairs to Thana, but quickly realize that she is the murderer when she steps out of the room with her pistol. Thana then begins a shooting spree, targeting many of the men present. Her co-worker Laurie picks up the knife from the cake table and stabs Thana in the back. Thana turns around and points the gun at Laurie, but hesitates; she screams in pain, \"Sister!\" then falls to the ground and dies.\n\nAfter the party massacre, Mrs. Nasone is seen crying in memorial for her husband and her dog Phil. But outside her apartment door, Phil has returned and is shown running up the stairs and scratching at the door.\n\n\nMany years later Zoë Tamerlis described how minimal the script was, which is uncharacteristic of Ferrara's later films.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 32 reviews.\n\nIn 1983, the film was released on VHS by U.S.A. Home Video in its uncut form. \"Ms .45\" was released on DVD in the United States on April 25, 2000, by Image Entertainment, but was re-edited for DVD release. The reedit removes less than a minute total. The cuts include changes to the first rape featuring Ferrara's cameo, which is split by an insert shot from a later scene. The second rape is more drastically cut, omitting the line \"This oughta make you talk, huh?\" The climactic Halloween party shoot-out was also recut to remove an on-screen murder, which now occurs off screen.\n\nThe uncut DVD, Blu-ray, digital copy is now available in the US, released by Drafthouse Films.\n\n"}

Massawa's excellent harbor was vital first to the Italian then to the British war effort.\n\nEllsberg, a skilled writer, described how a small group of workers under his direction accomplished an almost Herculean task with virtually no resources. Much of the story is an entertaining account of the bureaucratic politics of working in a remote backwater far from support and assistance.\n\nEllsberg paints a realistic picture of confusion and incompetence in the early days of the war. He was particularly caustic about the American civilian contractor building facilities at Ghinda and Asmara, where it was much cooler than at Massawa but was too far away for the facilities to ever be used by harbor personnel. The company, Johnson, Drake & Piper, Inc., itself claimed credit for clearing the port in the privately printed book, \"Middle East War Projects of Johnson, Drake & Piper, Inc., for the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, 1942–1943\" (New York: Johnson, Drake & Piper, Inc., 1943). That book contains beautiful photographs and drawings showing projects around the Middle East.\n\nEllsberg, who had vast technical knowledge and experience, described experts as \"...people who know so much about how things have been done in the past that they are usually blind to how they can be done in the future.\"\n\n\nThe story of Ellsberg's heroic effort inspired Eurobank's Polish division (Eurobank Poland) to create a corporate project management training program called \"Massawa Training\", which in 2007 won the PMI Award in its category.\n"}

He is currently wrestling on the independent circuit. He is known for his work in World Wrestling Entertainment under the name Mike Knox. He is also known for his work in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling under the ring name Knux.\n\nHettinga worked for Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW) in 2000. He tagged with Samoa Joe at UPW Proving Ground on December 12, 2000 in the Galaxy Theatre of Santa Ana, California and defeated the debuting Al Katrazz with Basil. He also wrestled at UPW live against the boss Samoa Joe for the Heavyweight Championship, but was unable to win the title.\n\nAfter being trained by Steve \"Navajo Warrior\" Islas, Knox started wrestling for Islas' organization Impact Zone Wrestling in 2002. He was booked to win the Heavyweight Championship on two occasions and the Tag Team Championship with friend and rival Derek Neikirk on one occasion.\n\nKnox was signed to a World Wrestling Entertainment developmental deal in February 2005, and made a handful of appearances on WWE shows, including one appearance as a masked \"jihadist\" for Muhammad Hassan, in the infamous segment that led to Hassan's ousting from WWE. He mainly wrestled for their Atlanta, Georgia-based developmental territory, Deep South Wrestling.\n\nKnox debuted on the June 20, 2006 episode of \"ECW\" as a heel by interfering in Kelly Kelly's striptease segment, coming from the backstage area and covering her with a towel before escorting her off stage, though he was unnamed on-screen at the time. It was later revealed that Kelly was Knox's on-screen girlfriend, and he informed her that he did not appreciate her stripping in front of anyone but him. For his in-ring debut, a win over Danny Doring, Kelly accompanied him to the ringside acting as a valet. Knox was pushed strongly, interfering in matches, and squashing his opponents. He later formed a short-lived tag team with Test before starting a feud with CM Punk, after growing jealous of Kelly Kelly's admiration towards Punk. CM Punk won every match in the feud, including a qualifying match for December to Dismember's Elimination Chamber match.\n\nKnox made his pay-per-view debut at Survivor Series where he teamed up with Rated-RKO, but was the first man eliminated after taking a superkick from Shawn Michaels. Upon his elimination, he was subsequently mocked by D-Generation X, as he was virtually unknown compared to the other participants. His next pay-per-view appearance saw him abandon Kelly Kelly during a mixed tag team match against Kevin Thorn and Ariel at December to Dismember, resulting in his team's loss. He then attacked her on the next \"ECW\" episode, breaking the duo up for good.\n\nAfter being taken off television, Knox returned on February 13, 2007 episode \"ECW\", where he lost easily to CM Punk. Knox was again taken off television for several months in order to return to Deep South Wrestling. On March 1, Knox and Derek Neikirk, the reformed Team Elite, were booked to win the Tag Team Championship after defeating the Major Brothers.

After months without any notable storylines, he began a feud with Tommy Dreamer whom he defeated in a series of matches, including an Extreme Rules match on the 100th episode of \"ECW\". He then began a feud with Finlay. After weeks of confrontations between the two, they finally had a match on the August 26 edition of \"ECW\", where they had an ECW Championship scramble qualifying match, which was won by Finlay.\n\nOn the October 27 and November 3, 2008 episodes of \"Raw\", two vignettes were aired to promote his arrival on the brand. His look drastically changed as well from his previous clean cut look to long unkempt hair and a long beard. He debuted the following week, on November 10, defeating D-Lo Brown. He attacked Rey Mysterio two times over a period of three weeks. After losing to Mysterio, Knox attacked Rey once again. Interviewer Todd Grisham, asked Knox why he attacked Rey Mysterio and he answered saying he did not know why. In a house show at Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Knox won a battle royal to become an entrant at the World Heavyweight Championship Elimination Chamber match at No Way Out. At the event, he was eliminated by Chris Jericho and was the second competitor eliminated overall.\n\nOn April 15, Knox was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft. He made his debut for the brand on the May 8, 2009 episode of \"SmackDown\", defeating R-Truth in a singles match. This was his last win on television for WWE; from late May 2009 until his release in April 2010, Knox lost all the 30 televised matches he wrestled on either \"SmackDown\" or \"WWE Superstars\", whether it be in singles, tag, or multi-man matches.\nOn the August 14 episode of \"SmackDown\", Knox debuted new elements to his character that included knowledge of biology and the human anatomy, using this knowledge to methodically inflict pain upon his opponents. Knox's final match was a loss to JTG on the April 23, 2010 edition of \"SmackDown\", on the same day WWE announced that Knox had been released from his contract.\n\nMike Knox competed against Corporal Robinson and Raven at JCW Bloodymania IV.

This idea was supported and accelerated after the disastrous Boxer Rebellion. During the incident, 48 Catholic missionaries and 18000 members were martyred while 182 Protestant missionaries and 500 Chinese Christians were martyred.\n\nAlthough this incident led to the downfall of the Qing Dynasty, Western missionaries encouraged Chinese Christians to be self-sufficient economically, self-preaching, and self-pastoring even if it meant breaking away from their original Protestant denominations.\n\nThe earliest known Independent Church existed in 1862 with the title, \"Minnan Church\". Little is known about this church since most of the records were recorded in the local Minnan dialect rather than in Mandarin. Information regarding this church is slowly being ‘discovered’ and translated.\n\nThe Gospel of Grace Church or Grace Evangelical church was founded at Shandong by Xi Sheng-Mo (席胜魔) in 1881. In 1906, Yu Zong-Zhou (俞宗周) established this church in Shanghai. These were some of the early indigenous churches established by local Chinese Christians.\n\nThe True Jesus Church was registered in Beijing in 1917. Early workers include Paul Wei, Zhang Lingsheng, and Barnabas Zhang. The General Coordination Board was established in Nanjing which was later moved to Shanghai. The English version of the church name was once the “True Jesus Mission”.\n\nThis independent church is an offshoot or breakaway from the first wave of the Pentecostal movement in the United States during the early 1900s. Pentecostal missionaries from the Azusa Street Revival were the first to arrive in Hong Kong as early as October 1907. The Pentecostal movement in China spread through Protestant organizations that were already established, leading to the creation of the True Jesus Church and many others.\nThe True Jesus Church was also later established in Taiwan in 1926. Presently there are more than three hundred churches and prayer houses in Taiwan.\n\nAlso known as the local churches, the Church Assembly Hall is a church founded by Watchman Nee, Zhou-An Lee, Shang-Jie Song and others when they started holding family services in 1922.\n\nThey began arranging “small group hymn singing” sessions in Shanghai so many Chinese refer to them as the “small group” and they were known (or the nickname) as the \"Little Flock\", and because at that time, they were still using the Plymouth Brethren's Hymn Book called \"Little Flock Hymn Book\".\n\n\nThe Jesus Family is a unique Pentecostal communitarian church first established in Shandong province in the late 1920s. It is a more distinctive type of independent churches in China. Founded and established by Jing Dianying (敬奠瀛) near Mazhuang, they are located mostly in rural areas.\nAt that time, their main message was, \"Leave your old family and enter the new family.\" What they meant was that converts were to break away Leave your old family and your old world, enter the new family and new world from their original family system and enter the new ‘Family of Jesus’. The new converts were also required to bring out all their possessions and share it out with all its members.\n\nAfter they have left their previous families or societies and joined the Jesus Family, the next step was, \"Change to a new life, Jesus is our Lord,\" which meant that the new converts must adopt new lifestyles and that their behaviours of should change. Jesus Christ was to be the Head of the household.\n\nStep three was to \"Break down food, clothing and shelter; fulfil food, clothing and shelter.\" This is a vivid description of the Jesus Family lifestyle which meant that the new members must change their old habits on food, clothing and shelter. For example, if you like wearing flashy clothes, eating delicious buffets, and living in luxurious mansions (which is what everyone craves for), then it is time give up all these habits by stop being materialistic and start living a more simplified life.\n\nAfter the new Jesus Family members have adopted a very simple lifestyle, the statement “fulfil food, clothing and shelter” means that everything is to be shared among its Family Members including all the food produce and income earned.\n\nThe Jesus Family was basically imitating the example of the early Apostolic Church in Jerusalem that was recorded in the book of Acts. The early church also lived a communal lifestyle of giving and sharing and loving each other.\nOf course, this type of farming lifestyle is obviously easier to fulfil in the countryside so the Jesus Family followers are mainly situated in rural areas rather than cities.\n\nThe last step of their message was to: “\"Live and die for the Lord with all your heart\"”, which clearly shows the Jesus Family mentality of living every day for the Lord and being willing to die for the Lord’s sake if and when persecution arises.\n\nThe Jesus Family Church is considered quite unique and stood out among the other independent churches in China. In reality, this type of Communal\nlifestyle can also be found in Israel today (The Israeli “Kibbutz”).\n\nIt originally was just a family service but was later established as a new church by Wang Mingdao (王明道) at Beijing in 1937. The Christian Tabernacle was founded without the help of any foreign missionary so it was essentially Chinese Christians preaching to Chinese people. They also self-administer and are self-sufficient economically.\n\nWang Mingdao was especially tight on church entry. During the sixteen years from 1933 to 1949 only 570 believers received baptism, since every new believer must bring another convert to the church before baptism was allowed.\nHe said, “\"The sheep must have life, your behavior of giving birth to more sheep shows that you have life\"”. Therefore, being able to bring people to believe in the faith is evidence that indeed you are quite clear of the path to salvation. Although it does not mean that you have already received salvation, it shows that you are worthy to become one of their church members.\n\nOnce Wang Mingdao's strict entry requirements have been satisfied, both the new convert’s behavior and lifestyle will be closely observed or examined by church members for a period. This is done in order to confirm that the new believer really is behaving as a Christian ought to behave and that his faith truly has a solid foundation.\n\nThe independent churches established during the republican era are the most well known and representative of the many independent churches in China. Today, many of them constitute a significant portion of what is generally termed the house church movement in China, because after 1949, with the arrival of Communist control and departure of all foreign missionaries, all Chinese Christian denominations had become independent.\n\n"}

The brand is an offshoot of her then-husband Russell Simmons' Phat Farm clothing brand. Baby Phat was officially relaunched in December 2019.\n\nBaby Phat is an urban womenswear brand first established under Phat Fashions LLC in 1999. Presented with a prototype of a Phat Farm T-shirt for female consumers, Kimora Lee Simmons recalled saying: \"I would never wear this. It is very athletic and basic, a scaled-down version of what a guy would wear.\" Not content with criticizing the prototype, Simmons took on the responsibility as Baby Phat's designer, creating a collection she would wear. The clothing brand included sexy jeans and tops adorned with a curvy cat logo inspired by her pet cat, Max. It was created for women, especially women of color, whom Simmons believed had no voice in the streetwear industry.\n\nBaby Phat's first show took place in 2000 as an extension of Kimora Lee's then-husband, Russell Simmons' Phat Farm, and Phat Fashions label. It drew attention from the hip-hop community, which had a close relationship with Russell Simmons' record label Def Jam Recordings. Baby Phat received celebrity endorsements from Aaliyah, who sat in the front row during a fashion show, and Lil' Kim, who modeled a rhinestone, logo-emblazoned sheer bikini under a faux-fur coat.\n\nIn 2004, the company expanded its operations by selling a custom Motorola i833 mobile phone exclusively at Bloomingdale's. The limited-edition pink, diamond-studded flip-phone was available for purchase for $699.99. In the same year, Simmons created a new shoe line for Baby Phat that included stilettos, wedges, boots, and toddler shoes.\n\nIn June 2019, Baby Phat collaborated with fashion retailer Forever 21. The line had 18 clothing items featuring the brand's signature cat, all priced under $25. On December 6, 2019, Baby Phat relaunched on its own and published a Spring/Summer 2020 campaign on its website. Simmons’ daughters, Aoki Lee and Ming Lee, were responsible for the relaunch.\n\nBaby Phat's celebrity fans include Alicia Keys, Rihanna, Chrissy Teigen, Kim Kardashian West, Christina Milian, Britney Spears, Missy Elliott and Monica (many of whom sat front row during Simmons' Fashion Week performances).\n\nModels Alek Wek and Devon Aoki both collaborated with Baby Phat. Carmen Kass, Eva Herzigova, and Lil' Kim have also walked the runway for the brand. \n\nKimora Lee Simmons, explaining her choice of models on the Baby Phat runway, said: \"It's very deliberate. It includes people who are sometimes forgotten but are great models—they have fierce walks and bodies, strong girls, but they might sometimes be a size bigger than the other one who was a size 8. They have more hip, more color, more bang to their personality. It's what I represent culturally in society: all colors, all women, all shapes and sizes.\"\n\n"}

It is served by a steep, well maintained road. A village of the same name as the mountain (\"Yamanlar\") is found on its slopes, on the road to the summit. The village administratively depends on İzmir's metropolitan district of Karşıyaka and is at a distance of from Karşıyaka center.\n\nThe summit commands an expansive view of the Gulf of İzmir from the northeast and there are amenities such as bungalows for visitors. A crater lake called \"Karagöl\" (meaning \"\"Black Lake\"\" in Turkish) is located near the summit, and is usually associated with the accounts surrounding Tantalus, the region's first known ruler. Because of this the lake's name is sometimes also called by his name.\n\nThe mountain is an extinct volcano. Although it is geologically separate from the neighboring mass of Mount Sipylus (\"Spil Dağı\"), their flora, fauna and history have very much in common, and the two mountains have sometimes been viewed as extensions of each other.\n\nThe name \"Yamanlar\" literally translates to \"\"the capable ones\"\", although the adjective \"\"yaman\"\" also has a number of negative connotations. The name is likely derived from the name of a monastery built in the beginning of the 13th century by John III Doukas Vatatzes. The monastery must have been named \"Amanariotissa\" or \"Mary of Amanara\", and was founded on the western slopes or foothills facing Smyrna of the Mount Nif, which itself was one of the mountains called Olympus in ancient times, hence the name of the principal monastery, \"Lembos\". An impression about the status of the village in Mount Yamanlar, then called \"Genikon\" or \"Jenikou\" is created by a document of the 13th century written by the inhabitants by which they donated to the monastery of Lembos another monastery, that of Amanariotissa, which was located within their territory. \n\nOn the other hand, Amanara, the root name referred to in the word Amanariotissa, being non-Greek, conjectural attempts have been made to explain the structure of the word through syncope, with the end corresponding to the Luwian language adjective \"\"ura\" (big)\", and the first part attachable to the deity name Amun or to proper nouns such as Amana and Amanus Mountains inter alia, transmitted here either through a Luwian connection once again or through the cult of Ammon well known to have been introduced into Greece at an early period or by the same token that led to the appellation of the ancient city of Larissa, within eyesight from the northern flank of the mountain, as \"Egyptian Larissa\", or to an interaction of these possibilities.\n\nMount Yamanlar was the location of the first recorded settlement which controlled the Gulf of İzmir circa 1440 BC, founded by Tantalus and possibly named \"Naulochon\", deriving its wealth from the mines of the region.\n\nOn the steep southeastern slopes of the mountain, there is a \"Tomb of Tantalus\" dating from this very early period in Anatolian history. This tomb was explored by Charles Texier in 1835, while other schools place Tantalus's tomb, as well as the lake associated with his story, to other localities found on Mount Sipylus. The first location of Smyrna (\"Old Smyrna\") was also at the foot of Mount Yamanlar on what was at the time a small peninsula.\n\nThe same Bayraklı slopes was also where landslides caused by flash floods that had occurred on 3–4 November 1995 had claimed at least 61 lives in the slum-type residences that had mushroomed at the time in the area, and had caused material damage exceeding 50 million US Dollars. Incidents of a similar nature occurred also in autumn 2001 adding five more casualties to İzmir's toll of disaster victims. A better planned and managed urbanization along the silted slopes of the mountain, by preserving its historic heritage at the same time, is an ongoing concern for the city as a whole.\n\n"}

Cross is famous for his iconic 1933 \"\"For gorsake, stop laughing: this is serious!”\" cartoon as well as the \"Wally and the Major\" and \"The Potts\" cartoon strips.\n\nCross was the third son born to English-born parents, Theophilus Edwin Cross, builder and architect, and his wife Florence, née Stanbrough, who met in Brisbane, married in Sydney then sought their fortune in the United States. His father hoped to make money there but only found work as a carpenter (he became secretary of the American Carpenters' Union). Cross was born on 3 December 1888 in Los Angeles, California. The family returned to Australia in 1892 when Stan was four years old and settled in Perth, Western Australia.\n\nCross was a gifted student who attended Perth High School on a scholarship. The University of Adelaide offered him a scholarship but Cross turned it down due to his father's ill-health. He left school at sixteen and joined the State Government Railways Department as a clerical cadet. He studied art for a number of years during the evenings at Perth Technical School. In 1912, at the age of twenty four, he resigned from his job and, with the financial assistance of his brother, travelled to London to study at Saint Martin's School of Art. During that time, some of his cartoons were accepted by \"Punch\". Before sailing for England, he twice exhibited his paintings and pen-and-ink works, the first time in the West Australian Society of Arts 1913 Annual Exhibition, and the second in March 1914, with another Perth artist, Michael McKinlay.\n\nOn returning to Perth, Cross contributed freelance drawings to the \"Western Mail\" and \"The Sunday Times\", and while working as a railways draftsman in 1918, he was offered a job by Ernie Brewer of \"Smith's Weekly\" at £5 a week. Cross accepted the position and moved to Sydney in 1919. On 31 July 1920, Cross' first comic strip, \"The Man Who Waited\", was published in \"Smith's Weekly\". That was followed in the next week by the first episode of \"You & Me\". Originally a satire, featuring the characters \"Mr Pott\" and \"Whalesteeth\", designed as a means of offering political comment, it was quickly converted into a domestic humour strip. Cross continued to draw the weekly strip for nineteen years until he left Smith's in late December 1939. The strip was taken over by Jim Russell in 1940 and renamed to \"Mr & Mrs Potts\".\n\nOn 17 November 1924, Cross married a 25-year-old clerk Jessie May Hamilton (d. 1972) at the Waverley Methodist Church in Bondi Junction.\n\nIn 1928, Cross began another strip in \"Smith's Weekly\", \"Smith's Vaudevillans\", introducing the mis-matched characters of \"Rhubarb\", an alcoholic sailor, and \"Norman\", a fop who played the straight man to his drunken partner. Another Stan Cross success was the first \"Dad and Dave\" cartoons, also for \"Smith's Weekly\". The strip was a straight adaptation of the radio serial, which commenced in 1936, and ran for 2,276 episodes before finishing in 1951.\n\nDuring his time at \"Smith's Weekly\", Cross established a reputation as a skilled draftsman, particularly in the area of single-panel cartoons. In the 29 July 1933 issue of \"Smith's Weekly\", a Cross cartoon featured two men who had been working on top of a building construction. There has been a mishap, and now one is hanging by his fingers from a girder at a frightening height over a street. His mate, to save himself, has grabbed the trousers of the other, yanking them down over his ankles and, looking directly upwards, is convulsed with laughter, while the other implores: \"For gorsake, stop laughing: this is serious!\". Editor Frank Marien immediately dubbed it \"The Funniest Drawing in the World\". Such was the popularity of the cartoon that it was reprinted on a quality paper and distributed throughout Australia, with many also being sent overseas. All through the Depression years, and after, the prints, costing two shillings and sixpence, were framed and hung on walls in work-places, hotel bars, barbers' shops, and even in some shop windows.\n\nCross became \"Smith's Weekly\"'s highest-paid artist and second art editor. Short-run series he devised included: \"Things That Make Stan Cross\" (political and economic criticism), \"Places We Have Never Visited\" (law courts, Parliament, the players' room at a test cricket match, etc.), \"Museum of the Future\" and \"Firsts in Australian History\" (the first barmaid, the first strike, the first football match).\n\nTowards the end of 1939, \"Smith's Weekly\" was in the financial trouble and Cross was induced by Keith Murdoch to join the Melbourne \"Herald\". Capitalising on his reputation as a comic strip artist, Cross was asked to create a newly daily strip, and he started his most popular strip, \"The Winks\" on 20 April 1940. For the first three months, the strip employed a domestic comedy theme and was basically a toned down version of \"You & Me\". The characters \"Mr Wink\" reflected the role of Mr Potts, while the tall, thin, long-faced character was similar to \"Whalesteeth\". In the initial stages, the characters were given their own weekly strip, \"Tidley Winks & Wally\". \"The Winks\" was only moderately popular until Cross decided to change the strip's direction and take the main characters into the Army. Mr Winks became Major Winks on 15 July 1940 and the strip was renamed \"Wally and the Major\". Over the next thirty years in newspapers throughout Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, and in eighteen annual comic books (c.1943–60), readers were able to enjoy the extraordinary, knock-about adventures and lifestyle of Private Wally Higgins, Major Winks, Pudden Bensen, and a company of comedy players—in the army in World War II and, afterwards, on their North Queensland sugarcane plantation. He continued to produce the strip until failing eyesight forced him to get help with the drawings early in 1970. Carl Lyon started to ink in Cross' pencil drawings. and Lyon eventually took over all the drawing, with Cross writing the stories, and took over completely when Cross retired later that year.\n\nCross was a foundation member of the Black and White Artists Society (later Club), Sydney, and served as president from 1931 to 1954. Their annual trophy \"The Stanley\" was named for him, with the award taking the shape of the figures in his classic cartoon, \"For gorsake, stop laughing: this is serious\".\n\nCross also wrote books on accountancy, economics and English grammar, and treatises on soil conservation. He painted watercolours and there is some speculation that Cross and George Finey held the first exhibition at David Jones Art Gallery. In 1970, he retired from the Melbourne Herald and joined his family at Armidale, New South Wales, where he died on 16 June 1977 at the age of eighty-eight. The epitaph on his tombstone reads, \"Stop laughing, this is serious\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2255266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255266", "title": "British Birds Rarities Committee", "text": "British Birds Rarities Committee\n\nThe British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC), established in 1959, is the national bird rarities committee for Britain. It assesses claimed sightings of bird species that are rarely seen in Britain, based on descriptions, photographs and video recordings submitted by observers. Its findings are published in an annual report in the journal \"British Birds\".\n\nThe BBRC covers around 280 species whose annually recorded sightings in Britain fall below a threshold deemed to signify rarity. Since the establishment of the committee, some previously included species have become more common—or at least better recorded; this has resulted in their removal from the committee's list and their reclassification as \"scarce migrants\".\n\nThe committee has a chairman, a secretary, and ten voting members, and is supported by others who serve in an advisory capacity. Since its inception, a total of 69 people have served on the committee as assessors. In addition to assessing annual records of rare birds, the committee conducts regular reviews of batches of previously accepted records on a species-by-species basis, to ensure that only those consistent with advances in knowledge of bird identification are retained, and to determine the subspecies of accepted records. Several species have been problematic for assessment, and extreme examples have taken more than 20 years from initial observation to acceptance. The committee has been criticised for its approach to assessing records where only one observer was present, for not publishing reasons for rejecting the validity of records, and for placing undue weight on descriptive detail when assessing record submissions. Seabird identification has proved particularly difficult, leading some observers to suggest that the committee sets too high a standard.\n\nThe \"Rarity Records Committee\" (as it was originally known) was established in 1959 by the editors of the journal \"British Birds\". Its original purpose was to provide a means whereby uniform assessment standards could be applied to all rare bird records across Britain. Prior to the establishment of the committee, records were assessed by local bird recording organisations using varying standards. The most recent statement of the British Birds Rarities Committee's role is given in Bradshaw, Harvey and Steele (2004):\n\nBBRC aims to maintain an accurate database of the occurrence of rare taxa in Britain, in order to enable individuals or organisations to assess the current status of, and any changes in, the patterns of occurrence and distribution of these taxa in Britain.\n\nContradictory information has been published on the exact nature of the committee's status. On its website, BBRC describes itself as the \"official adjudicator of rare bird records in Britain\" (although it does not say on what basis it has this status). In \"Birders: Tales of a Tribe\", author Mark Cocker erroneously describes the committee as a \"statutory vetting body\" (i.e. one established by an Act of Parliament). BBRC's constitution states that it \"has no automatic or legal expectation that birders submit records\".\n\nThe committee does not assess records of birds from Ireland; that task is carried out by the Irish Rare Birds Committee, which publishes its decisions in \"Irish Birds\". Records of IRBC-assessed rarities were included in BBRC annual reports for many years, although this ceased in 2002 at the request of IRBC. Although the British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee does not regard records from the Isle of Man as contributing towards their British list, BBRC does include records from there in its totals. BBRC has had an ongoing sponsor in the German optical equipment manufacturer Carl Zeiss since 1983.\n\nOver 580 bird species have been recorded in Britain; some 250 have regular breeding or wintering populations, or are common migrants, and a further 50 are \"scarce migrants\". The BBRC assesses the remaining species. A list of the species the committee assesses (known as \"British Birds rarities\", or \"BB rarities\" for short) is on its website, although the list has not been updated to account for the most recent changes. The committee generally considers only the records of species rare enough to meet its criteria for inclusion on the BBRC rarities list, based on a numerical threshold. In addition to considering full species, records of some rare subspecies are considered and, in a few cases, the committee considers indeterminate records (birds that belong to a pair or group of rare species that are particularly difficult to separate, such as frigatebirds or dowitchers).\n\nThe committee keeps the list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if it has more than 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). There have been three major \"purges\" of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their \"normal\" British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.\n\nMany other species and subspecies have been removed over the years: Cetti's warbler (in 1976); long-tailed skua (in 1979); common crane and ring-billed gull (in 1987); surf scoter, little egret, European bee-eater, Pallas's warbler and woodchat shrike (in 1990); green-winged teal (in 1992); ring-necked duck, greater short-toed lark and little bunting (in 1993); white-tailed eagle and Kumlien's gull (in 1998); American wigeon, black-crowned night heron and rose-coloured starling (in 2001); and black brant (in 2005).\n\nUntil 2009, the parrot crossbill was an anomaly, in that it was on the committee's list of species, even though a breeding population existed in Scotland. In 2009, this species was removed, along with white-billed diver and cattle egret.\n\nOnce removed, a species is classed as a \"scarce migrant\": \"British Birds\" publishes a separate annual report summarising the occurrence of these species, and the data is also presented on the Scarce Migrants website. In addition to parrot crossbill, four species, Cetti's warbler, little egret, long-tailed skua and Mediterranean gull, have become so common that they no longer qualify even as scarce migrants.\n\nThe committee has ten voting members, a chairman (who may be one of the ten, or may be another, non-voting individual) and a non-voting secretary. BBRC was assisted in its assessment of seabird records by a Seabirds Advisory Panel from 1987 to 1996. In 1999, the BBRC set up the \"RIACT\" (Racial Identification Amongst Changing Taxonomy) group to advise on how records of rare subspecies should be treated. RIACT published its first report in 2006, setting out the subspecies it believed were sufficiently diagnosable, and that occurred infrequently enough to justify being assessed by the rarities committee. Prior to this, a partial selection of rare subspecies had been routinely included in BBRC reports; the RIACT report aimed to bring consistency to the selection for future years. When a record is of a species not previously recorded in Britain in a wild state, BBRC deals with assessment of the bird's identification, then passes the record to the British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee, which decides whether the species should be included on the BOU's British Bird list.\n\nThe committee has two permanent posts, a Chairman and a Secretary: they are appointed by the board of \"British Birds\". There had been no fixed term for these appointments before 2008, however, a three-year fixed term, with a limit of ten years, was introduced with the change of chairman in that year. The current chairman, the committee's seventh, is Adam Rowlands; the six previous chairmen were Philip Hollom (1959–72), Ian Wallace (1972–76), Peter J. Grant (1976–86), Peter Lansdown (1986–93), Rob Hume (1993–97) and Colin Bradshaw (1997–2008). The committee's secretary is Nigel Hudson, appointed in 2007. Its previous secretaries were G. A. Pyman (1959–61), Christopher M. Swaine (1961–63), Denzil D. Harber (1963–66), F. R. Smith (1966–75), J. N. Dymond (1975–77), J. O'Sullivan (1977–78) and Mike Rogers (1978–2006).\n\nAt least one (usually the longest-serving) record-assessing member retires every year, to balance experience with \"new blood\". The committee usually nominates its own replacement candidate, but also invites nominations from others, and if any are received, holds an election among county bird recorders and the bird observatory network. A set of criteria for membership has been developed—currently, these are \"a widely acknowledged expertise in identification, proven reliability in the field, a track record of high quality submissions of descriptions of scarce and rare birds to county records committees and BBRC, considerable experience of record assessment, the capacity to handle the considerable volume of work involved in assessing upwards of 1,000 records per year and the capacity to work quickly and efficiently\". The following 69 individuals have served on BBRC in a records assessment capacity: \nA number of other individuals have served as the committee's statisticians, museum consultants, archivists and avicultural consultants, or on the Seabirds Advisory Panel or RIACT.\n\nThe committee has stated that it has a desire to be made up of members of \"all age ranges and both sexes\"; however, all BBRC members to date have been male, a fact reflected in the nickname \"the ten rare men\". Measures exist to ensure that the committee has a geographic balance amongst its membership—BBRC's constitution states that it \"should attempt to provide a reasonable geographical spread with members having a detailed knowledge of each of the following areas: Wales, Scotland, Northern England, the Midlands, the Southwest and the Southeast of England\".\n\nDocumentation of records, including the members' deliberations, are kept in the committee’s archives, which are deposited with the British Trust for Ornithology. Some older data is missing, as the committee's files were originally held by the editors of \"British Birds\", and they were not transferred to the new owners of the magazine when it was sold in the 1960s.\n\nThe committee publishes an annual report on the rare birds occurring each year, in \"British Birds\". This has usually been in the issue published in November of the following year, although the 2007 Report appeared in the October 2008 issue, and the committee has said that it plans to keep to this new timescale in future years.\n\nThe report typically begins with an introduction, summarising the most significant birds occurring during the year, and discussing any current issues relating to the committee's work. This is followed by a list of accepted records in taxonomic sequence. Records for each taxon are listed by county, followed by comments about its occurrence during the year. Late-accepted records and decisions to reject a previously identified record are included. This section of the report contains painted illustrations and photographs of some of the birds. The report lists records that have not been accepted, often noting the most significant that remain under consideration.\n\nThe committee also publishes frequent \"Rarities Committee news\" items (previously called \"Rarities Committee news and announcements\") in \"British Birds\".\n\nBBRC reviews 1200 to 1500 records each year (when it was first set up, the figure was around 200 per year). Of these, approximately 85% are accepted: this acceptance rate has remained steady for many years. Species that have caused particular problems include black kite, great snipe, gyrfalcon, gull-billed tern, and North Atlantic little shearwater. Peter Grant estimated that, during his tenure as chairman, approximately 2% of accepted records are incorrectly accepted, and 5% are incorrectly rejected.\n\nWallace (1973) addressed a number of criticisms of the committee including that it provides too little information on the reasons for rarity rejection. Alan Vittery and Sara McMahon have both argued that the committee should inform observers whose records are rejected of the committee's reasons for doing so. This view also has the support of the editor of \"Birdwatch\", Dominic Mitchell, who has made this the topic of editorials on a number of occasions.\n\nBBRC has from time to time published material illustrating its assessment process in an attempt to explain to a wider audience how it arrives at its decisions. Much of these have appeared in a series called \"From the Rarities Committees files\" in \"British Birds\" magazine. Another short series was published in \"Birdwatch\" magazine: entitled \"You: The Jury\", it featured six fictitious rarity accounts, with, in the subsequent issue, accounts from two rarities committee members stating how they would vote.\n\nFrom time to time, BBRC has re-reviewed records that it previously accepted, to ensure they are acceptable in the light of improved knowledge of the species in question. These reviews are carried out on a species-by-species basis. Old World warblers have proved particularly in need of re-review. A review of greenish warbler records was initiated in 1983. The purpose of this review was to establish whether records, particular those in late autumn and winter, of drab grey \"Phylloscopus\" warblers, which had previously been accepted as greenish warbler, were in fact this species, or were common chiffchaffs of the Siberian race \"tristis\". 48 records between 1958 and 1970 were examined. Of these, 20 were rejected. A review of Arctic warbler records was begun in 1991, with the aim of determining whether any greenish warblers had been mistakenly accepted as Arctics. The review was completed in 1994, although as of 2009, the results had not been published.\n\nA review of spectacled warbler records was initiated in 1984. This review resulted in the species being removed from the British list; of the three accepted records, one, at Spurn, Yorkshire in 1968, was re-identified as a first-year female subalpine warbler, while descriptions of the other two, at Porthgwarra, Cornwall in October 1969 and on Fair Isle in June 1979, were not considered sufficiently watertight to permit their continued acceptance. Spectacled warbler has since been re-added to the British list following an individual at Filey, Yorkshire in 1992, and there have been further subsequent records. In the late 1990s, BBRC reviewed some of the accepted records of moustached warbler, and concluded that one, from Sussex in 1979, was unacceptable, but that one other, from Buckinghamshire in 1965, should stand. Two further records, from Hampshire in 1951 and Kent in 1952, were reviewed as part of the 1950–1957 review (see below), and found to be unacceptable. Following these rejections, the Buckinghamshire record, and the remaining record, a breeding pair in Cambridgeshire in 1946, previously accepted as Britain's first, were scrutinised by the BOURC and found to be unacceptable, leading to the removal of moustached warbler from the British list; it has not re-occurred.\n\nA review of olivaceous warbler records commenced in 1986, and continued through the 1990s. The results of this review were published in 1999: six of the previously accepted records were rejected as not meeting modern identification standards. In 2003, following the split of olivaceous warbler into two species, the accepted records were all reviewed again to ascertain which of the two they were—all nine proved to be eastern olivaceous warblers. Following the split of Bonelli's warbler into two species, the committee reviewed all the 121 accepted records, and concluded that 51 were western and two were eastern; for the remainder, not enough evidence was available to make a firm decision. The committee had previously stated that it would regard as western Bonelli's warbler all except proven eastern Bonelli's warblers, however, this announcement rescinded that decision. In 2003–04, all desert warbler records were reviewed, and it was concluded that all were referable to the newly split Asian desert warbler, rather than African desert warbler.\nA review of American and Pacific golden plover records was begun in 1991, with the purpose of evaluating whether any individuals previously accepted as \"either American or Pacific\" could now be definitely assigned to one species or the other (and vice versa). The results (a small decrease in the number of accepted American golden plovers, and a small increase in the number of accepted Pacifics) were published in the committee's report for 1996, with a comment that a detailed paper on the subject was being prepared, although as of 2009, this has not been published. A review of isabelline shrike records commenced in 1986. This review, the results of which were published in 1989, established a racial identification for a number of adult isabelline shrikes previously accepted to species level. A further review, with the same aim, was begun in the late 1990s. A preliminary set of results of this review was published in 2003; four previously accepted individuals were rejected, including one, in Cambridgeshire in 1978, which is now thought have been a hybrid with red-backed shrike. The full results of this second review were published in 2007; some of the previous racial attributions were withdrawn, but the committee felt able to confidently assign a race for a number of more recent individuals, although it stressed that this could only be done with adult birds (the committee's 2005 report mentions that a further article is in preparation). A review of black-eared wheatears was conducted in 2002–04, with the aim of assigning individuals to the eastern and western races where possible; this was possible with nine records; both western \"hispanica\" and eastern \"melanoleuca\" were shown to have occurred.\n\nA review of semipalmated sandpiper records took place in the 1970s, resulting in seven of the twelve records being rejected. A review of black-headed wagtail records was initiated in 1983. The results were published in 1994 and 1995, and nine previously accepted records were judged to be unsound, due to possible confusion with grey-headed wagtail. A review of rufous turtle dove records took place in 1994, and concluded that three of the eight accepted records should no longer stand. A review of lesser kestrel records, begun in 1994, and completed in 1995, concluded that six accepted records of this species should no longer be regarded as acceptable. Five of the six were from autumn, whereas the overwhelming majority of records the committee continued to accept are from the spring/summer period. All 24 spring records of Siberian stonechat were reconsidered in 2002–04, in the light of new information on the variability in appearance of European stonechats in spring; the committee decided that all but five should remain accepted. In 2003, the committee revised its assessment criteria for male pine buntings, redefining some birds previously considered hybrids as acceptable, but requiring an overall greater level of precision in descriptions, and reviewed past records in the light of these changes.\n\nAs of 2017, the following reviews are underway: a review of past records of Macaronesian shearwaters, reviews of all claimed Nearctic cackling goose records, a review of great white egrets to establish if any are of the Nearctic race, a review of sandplovers, a review of records of the eastern race of redstart, a review of Orphean warbler records aimed at determining the race of each, and a review of subalpine warblers to determine which individuals are ascribable to the race \"albistriata\". It has also been suggested that reviews should be conducted of records of great snipe, as older records show a very different temporal occurrence pattern than more recent birds, the large numbers of gull-billed tern records from the English south coast from the 1960s, and desert wheatears, to establish racial identifications.\n\nMost records received by the committee are processed within a year and published in its annual report in \"British Birds\". Some records prove problematic, and for some species, it has taken the committee many years to come to a decision. This has particularly been the case where the species or subspecies in question was new to Britain—examples include northern harrier (Britain's first, in Scilly in 1982, accepted in 2007), long-toed stint (Britain's first, in Cornwall in 1970, accepted in 1994), least tern (Britain's first, and to date only record, accepted in 2005, after first occurring in 1983), black lark (Britain's first, from Spurn, Yorkshire in 1984, accepted in 2004 after a second set of notes came to light), Sykes's warbler (the first three records, from 1959, 1977, and 1993, accepted in 2003), Iberian chiffchaff (the first two records, from 1972 and 1992, accepted in 2000), and Hume's leaf warbler (the first 27 records, the earliest from 1966, accepted in 1998). Occasionally, decisions have been delayed due to non-ornithological factors, such as the loss by the Royal Mail of a file on Britain's first lesser short-toed lark.\n\nThe first three field records of Blyth's pipit, including an atypical pale individual on the Isles of Scilly, proved difficult, but following the occurrence of trapped individuals, on Fair Isle in 1993 and Suffolk in 1994, these were accepted. Some records of citrine wagtail and short-toed treecreeper were accepted only after prolonged consideration. Prior to the publication in 1984 of Jonsson and Grant's stint identification paper, a number of stints (\"Calidris\") proved difficult to assess; a paper covering four such cases was published in 1986. It included accounts of a bird on Fair Isle, originally thought Britain's first red-necked stint that turned out to be a sanderling; and a bird in Suffolk, The \"Felixstowe stint\", which most observers at the time believed was a western sandpiper, but was in fact a semipalmated sandpiper. A previous paper details four early claims of red-necked stint, none of which were acceptable.\n\nAs of 2007, records of Wilson's snipe (from 1985 and 1998), elegant terns (from 2002), a number of eastern whitethroats and lesser whitethroats, and several apparent North African common chaffinches, are still under consideration.\n\nBBRC has had particular problems with a number of rare seabirds. The \"\"Chalice\" petrel\", a dark-rumped storm petrel seen and photographed in the Southwest Approaches in 1988, and believed by its observers to be a Matsudaira's storm petrel, was eventually rejected as other similar species could not be ruled out. Martin Garner and Killian Mullarney subsequently wrote a critical review of this decision, arguing that the evidence points to the bird having been a Swinhoe's storm petrel, the only dark-rumped storm petrel species otherwise recorded in the North Atlantic. They argued that the Seabirds Advisory Panel's assessment of the record was at fault, and a critical reappraisal of the evidence should have been prompted by the (then relatively recent) discovery in the North Atlantic of Swinhoe's storm petrel, and that the committee was instead too heavily swayed by the views of a single expert.\n\nA petrel seen from Dungeness, Kent and believed by its observers to be Britain's first herald petrel was rejected, although the committee noted that the bird was clearly \"an amazing seabird\". This decision sparked a number of letters to \"British Birds\" questioning whether the committee's stance is too strict. Fea's petrel is now officially accepted as having occurred, but for many years, the identification of these birds was accepted only as Fea's/Zino's/soft-plumaged petrel, followed by a period where they were referred to Fea's or Zino's; however, following BOURC acceptance of two birds in Scilly waters as Fea's petrels, BBRC published a paper arguing that all birds are likely to have been Fea's.\n\nThe occurrence in Britain of southern (i.e. south polar/brown) skuas is also unresolved. A series of reports of south polar skua, from 1982 to 1993, were all eventually rejected after being assessed for several years. Two other birds (from the Isles of Scilly in 2001, and Glamorgan in 2002 have been accepted (by the BOURC) as belonging to one or other of these two species, while a bird from Dorset in 1996 remains under consideration.\n\nIn 1996, Alan Vittery raised the question of whether the level of detail required by the committee for a description to be acceptable was too high. Similar points were made by Keith Vinicombe and Mike Pennington in 2001. In the light of the rejection of a record of Blyth's reed warbler in Shetland in 1997, Vinicombe and Pennington wrote to \"British Birds\" to question the decision. They suggested that the committee was becoming too focussed on minutiae in assessing bird descriptions, ignoring more obvious evidence, Vinicombe saying that \"the Committee has prevaricated to the point where it 'cannot see the wood for the trees'\". David Walker and Owen Leyshon, David Ferguson, and Andrew Duff have criticised the committee on similar grounds in relation to its approach to the assessment of rare seabirds, citing the Dungeness herald petrel claim as an example. Vittery, and Moss Taylor both expressed concern that BBRC was adopting too strict an approach for records of birds seen only by their finder.\n\nIn 1998, BBRC explained its approach to the assessment of single-observer records. The committee explained that while it understood that geographical and social circumstances make it likely that some people are more likely to find rare birds on their own, it is \"very cautious about observers with a high proportion of single-observer records\" and that its policy is to watch patterns closely and review those observers' past records on a regular basis. This approach has attracted criticism. Former BBRC chairman Ian Wallace and others have written about the subject in \"Birdwatch\" magazine. Wallace believes that the committee has a blacklist of observers, from whom it automatically rejects records unless there are other observers able to corroborate the sighting. He mentions two specific observers, both of whom live in remote parts of northern Scotland. Ken Shaw, a former BBRC member, has claimed that BBRC would not accept a single-observer record of a species new to Britain without photographic evidence, regardless of the track record of the observer. Graham Bell, another former member, writing in response to Shaw's article, has accused the committee of adopted unfounded suspicions, arguing that just because a competent observer moves to an underwatched part of the country, their abilities do not change. One of the observers who Wallace claimed was blacklisted, Alan Vittery, also contributed to the debate, stating that he had been informed by the BBRC that they would not consider any single-observer record he submitted, unless supported by a photograph. Vittery contrasted the BBRC's attitude with that of other national rarities committees, arguing that the result of the approach is to distort rarity statistics. Vittery invited the BBRC to reply in public, but this request was declined.\n\nThe BBRC conducted a detailed review into the controversial identification of a curlew seen at Druridge Bay in Northumberland in 1998, coming to the conclusion that it was, as had been believed by many observers, a first-summer slender-billed curlew. This identification was accepted by the British Ornithologists Union's Records Committee, leading to the addition of this species to the British List. The record was reviewed in 2014, and, after a split decision by both the BBRC and the BOURC, the record was found not proven and subsequently removed from the British List.\n\nA subcommittee was set up in 1997 to undertake a review of rare bird records from the years immediately prior to BBRC's establishment. The purpose of the review was to ensure that all records from 1950 onwards (the cut-off date for Category A of the BOU British List of birds) have been subjected to a similar level of scrutiny. Not all of the 1,100 records of species considered to be rarities at that time were assessed, but only those related to species not recorded more than 100 times by 1997, as well as a few records of less rare species under particularly unusual circumstances, which were termed \"sore thumbs\". Much of the original documentation was unavailable for the review, as it had been lost, and so for many records, the review was based solely on published accounts of the birds. The most notable outcome of this review was the reidentification of a frigatebird record from Tiree in 1953. Previously identified as a magnificent frigatebird, the BBRC review concluded that the bird was in fact an Ascension frigatebird, the only individual of this species ever identified in Europe (Walbridge, Small & McGowan 2003). The full results of the review were published in 2006. Of the 126 records reviewed, 37 were rejected as unacceptable. These included a claimed white-tailed eagle, which broke into a chicken-run in a garden and stole a chicken, three little crakes, three Eurasian scops owls, the only late December record of tawny pipit, three black-eared wheatears, a record of two White's thrushes together in April, a spring lanceolated warbler, two moustached warblers and a pine grosbeak. Furthermore, issues were found with the identification of Britain's first western sandpiper, on Fair Isle in 1956, and these led the BOURC to reject this record. The western sandpiper has been recorded several times subsequently in Britain however, and remains on the national list. The subcommittee's final report also hints at the prospect that some records from immediately prior to 1950 may be incorrect; because these fell outside the timeframes of the review they were not reassessed.\n\nOnly a single known hoax involving a record submitted to BBRC has become public. In autumn 1994, Nigel Pepper, a birdwatcher from Essex, claimed to have recorded a hermit thrush in a garden in Chipping Ongar. Doubts about the record were raised in \"Birdwatch\" and BBRC reviewed the record in 2002, but decided that it should stand. In 2009, Nigel Pepper came clean and revealed in \"Birdwatch\" magazine (\"Birdwatch\" 204: 46-47) that the record was actually a hoax, made in protest at perceived suppression of rare bird records in the county. He revealed that the Hermit Thrush in question was actually photographed in Canada on a recent birdwatching trip.\n\n\n"}

Melius Christiansen\n\nFredrik Melius Christiansen (April 1, 1871 – June 1, 1955) was a Norwegian-born violinist and choral conductor in the Lutheran choral tradition.\n\nFredrik Melius Christiansen, the son of a Norwegian factory worker, was born in Eidsvold, municipality in Akershus county, Norway. He took up music at an early age: By three years old he could play his first clarinet, and at six he was marching in his father's band. In addition to clarinet, he went on to learn the violin, piano, and pipe organ. In his teens, he became so proficient at the pipe organ as to be able to take his teacher's place as the organist in Sunday services, although his true passion was the violin. To pay for his lessons, he himself taught piano and violin to beginners, but soon realized that he would meet with limited success in his home country. Thus, at 17, F. Melius emigrated to the United States.\n\nHe briefly stayed with his uncle in Oakland, California but was unable to find work as an organist. He then moved to Washburn, Wisconsin where his brother Karl resided, staying for two years before he moved on to Marinette, Wisconsin. In Marinette, he directed both the city band and the church choir, in addition to teaching private lessons. It was there that he witnessed a performance by a male quartet from Augsburg College in Minneapolis, which left a favorable impression and led to his enrollment in 1892.\n\nAfter completing the freshman courses at Augsburg, he attended the Northwestern Conservatory of Music, graduating with honors in his studies of music theory and counterpoint. He returned to Marinette to marry Edith Lindem, and in 1897, moved to Leipzig, Germany to study for two years at the Royal Conservatory of Music. While there, he became a regular attendee of the St. Thomas Choir, directed by Gustav Schreck, who was F. Melius' teacher in counterpoint, conducting, and composition. Following the completion of his diploma, F. Melius moved back to Minneapolis with his wife and first child, Elmer, where he enjoyed success as a violin faculty member of Northwestern Conservatory of Music, an organist in a local Lutheran church, and the director of the Kjerulf Male Chorus.\n\nIn 1901, Christiansen was recruited by St. Olaf College president John N. Kildahl. The St. Olaf Choir was founded as an outgrowth of the St. John's Lutheran Church Choir in Northfield. For the next 30 years, Christiansen led the St. Olaf Choir, striving for perfect intonation, blend, diction and phrasing. He was a skilled conductor, directing bands and choirs alike. He assumed direction of the St. Olaf Band in 1903, and took the ensemble on tour to Norway in 1906 to play for King Haakon VII, making it the first college music ensemble to conduct a tour abroad. Though his first love was the violin, he received international fame as founding director of the St. Olaf Choir of St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, USA from 1912 to 1944. Christiansen was considered a pioneer in the art of a cappella (unaccompanied) choral music. Christiansen composed and arranged over 250 musical selections and his choral techniques were spread throughout the U.S. by St. Olaf graduates. The Christiansen choral tradition is a recognized feature of American choral music.\n\n\nFour of Christiansen's children survived to adulthood, two of them adding their own legacy to the Christiansen tradition of choral music in America.\n\n"}

That marks it chronologically as the first battle to take place during World War I, beginning shortly before the Battle of Mulhouse. The Imperial German troops were obliged to entrench and bring up heavy siege artillery. He laid siege to Liège, which he entered on August 7, 1914, but the last forts did not surrender until August 16, 1914.\n\nAfter the fall of Liège, Emmich reverted to corps command and fought at the Marne and in the trench warfare near Reims. In April 1915 Emmich was transferred to the Eastern front where he fought in the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive.\n\nEmmich was ennobled in 1913. He died of arteriosclerosis in Hanover.\n\n"}

For instance, Sir Walter Scott published \"The Fortunes of Nigel\" in 1822, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle published \"Sir Nigel\" in 1905–06. \"Nigel\" was a common name for boys born in England and Wales from the 1950s to the 1970s (see below).\n\n\"Nigel\" has never been as common in other countries, but was among the 1,000 most common names for boys born in the United States from 1971 to 2010. Numbers peaked in 1994 when 447 were recorded (it was the 478th most common boys' name that year). The peak popularity at 0.02% of boys' names in 1994 compares to a peak popularity in England and Wales of about 1.2% in 1963, 60 times higher.\nIn Australian English, it is a colloquial term for a male social misfit or a friendless person, originating from the name being unusual in the 1980s and alliterating with \"no-friends\" (both start with \"n\").\n\nThe name is derived from the church Latin '. This Latin word would at first sight seems to derive from the Latin ', meaning \"black\"; however, this is now considered an example of an incorrect etymology created by French-speaking clerics, who knew Latin as well, to translate the Norman first name \"Neel\" in the Latin written documents. The Latin word ' gave birth to Old French ' (modern \"\"), meaning “niello, black enamel” and it explains the confusion, because the clerics believed it was the same etymology as the first name \"Neel\", spelled the same way.\n\nThe Old Norman first name \"Neel\" (modern surname \"Néel\") derives from the Norse \"Njáll\". The Norse \"Njáll\", in turn, is derived from the Gaelic \"Niall\".\n\nThe following table shows the number of boys given the first name Nigel in specific years in England and Wales. Numbers peaked in about 1963. In 1964 it was the 23rd most popular boys' name. By 2016 the number of boys named Nigel had dropped below 3, the minimum number reported by the ONS.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This area became settled by Europeans after a gold-bearing reef discovered in 1886 and sparked the gold rush that gave rise to the establishment of Johannesburg.\n\nWest Rand extends from Randfontein in the west to Roodepoort in the east, and includes the town of Krugersdorp. The areas of Carletonville and Westonaria are sometimes included as being part of the Far West Rand. The areas are economically linked to the city through the gold mining industry. Following the creation of the Johannesburg unicity in 1999, Roodepoort, which is traditionally regarded as part of the West Rand, became part of Johannesburg municipality. After 1999, much of the area (excluding Roodepoort, which became part of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality) became part of the newly formed West Rand District Municipality.\n\nDespite being a separate municipal area, like the East Rand, the West Rand is included in the Witwatersrand urban area. To this end, the West Rand shares the same dialling code as Johannesburg (011 locally) and the same metropolitan route numbering system as Johannesburg (and the East Rand). It is not uncommon for residents of the West Rand to work in Johannesburg proper and vice versa.\n"}

It is the fourth oldest state police agency and was created in the second extraordinary session of the West Virginia Legislature on June 19, 1919 as a result of uprisings surrounding organized labor in the coal and mine industries.\n\nGovernor John Jacob Cornwell was insistent upon having a State Police force which he said, \"was mandatory in order for him to uphold the laws of our state.\" Part of the compromise was the name of the organization: \"West Virginia Department of Public Safety\" was the official name until 1995 when the name was changed to \"West Virginia State Police\" during the legislative session.\n\nLike other state law enforcement agencies, West Virginia troopers enforce traffic laws statewide, investigate crimes and protect the governor and his immediate family. The superintendent of the West Virginia State Police is Colonel Jan Cahill with Lieutenant Colonel Dwayne Bowles and Major Vince Deeds serving under Colonel Cahill\n\nWest Virginia State Police troopers wear a forest-green uniform and campaign hat. They receive their training at the West Virginia State Police Academy located in Institute, a suburb of Charleston, and near the agency's headquarters in South Charleston. Upon appointment, cadets undergo an intense training program at the State Police Academy.\n\nThe West Virginia State Police also runs its own forensic laboratory and provide scientific investigation services to law enforcement agencies across the state. Services offered to criminal justice agencies include biochemistry, drug, firearm investigations, latent prints, questioned documents, toxicology and trace evidence. The crime lab is accredited by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board (ASCLD/LAB).\n\nThe West Virginia Division of Criminal Justice Services is responsible for setting minimum physical ability standards for police officers working in the state. In 2007, following a national trend, it relaxed the physical ability standards for aspiring police officers. Right now, any police applicant must do at least 27 push-ups/minute, 29 sit-ups/minute and be able to run in a maximum time limit of 14 minutes 53 seconds. The State Police, however, chose not to follow those standards unlike most local police agencies in West Virginia. The agency's recruiters still require applicants to perform at least 27 push-ups/minute, 29 sit-ups/minute and those same applicants have to run in no more than 14 minutes 52 seconds, which were all the initial minimum requirements for all police departments in West Virginia.\n\nTraining at the paramilitary academy lasts about 25 weeks compared to about 16 weeks for officers from other departments (trained at the same academy). When cadets graduate, they are promoted to the rank of \"Trooper.\" They can be stationed anywhere in the 55 West Virginia counties working from detachments (barracks). They serve an eighteen-month probationary period that starts at the time they enter the academy. After completing successfully that probationary period, they are eligible to receive an associate degree in police sciences through the Marshall Technical and Community College program.\n\nThe State Police has struggled with staffing issues for many years and the problem seems to persist mainly due to lack of funding to dramatically increase the number of road troopers. As of 2013, the agency employed well above 600 sworn officers, making it de facto the largest law enforcement agency in the state. The State Police is heavily relied upon to assist in many of the 55 West Virginia counties. In September 2013, news organizations started reporting a new initiative from the agency to increase manpower. The Accelerated Cadet Program targets local West Virginia police officers who want to join the State Police. Once hired, such officers would train for only 11 weeks instead of the 25 weeks normal cadets go through.\n\nThe State Police is and has been the only agency to operate a law enforcement academy in West Virginia. It trains its own troopers but also all other law enforcement officers from the state: sheriff deputies, city and college police officers, and motor carrier enforcement officers who, unlike in some states, are not part of the State Police but have their own separate agency.\n\nState Police vehicles are composed of a variety of makes with blue and gold colors accompanied by the agency's logo on the side front doors. For many years, the agency has used Ford Crown Victorias for the road. In recent years however, State Police has phased in Chevy Impalas and the new Ford Police Interceptor and Police Interceptor Utility into its fleet. The agency also uses unmarked vehicles that are usually assigned to command staff members. Vehicles are mainly equipped with blue LED lights.\n\nTroopers are issued the .45 ACP Smith & Wesson 4566TSW, a version of the Smith & Wesson Model 4506. It has a bobbed hammer and blue metal finish. Each WVSP 4566TSW has the agency name and shoulder patch engraved. Each Trooper is issued an attachable flashlight which mounts to their pistol.\n\nAs of December 2018, Troopers are now using Glock 17 Gen 5 9mm handguns.\n\n\nTroop 0 Command - South Charleston\n\nTroop 1 Command - Shinnston\n\nTroop 2 Command - Charles Town\n\nTroop 3 Command - Elkins\n\nTroop 4 Command - South Charleston\n\nTroop 5 Command - Logan\n\nTroop 6 Command - Beckley\n\nTroop 7 Parkways (WV Turnpike) Command - Beckley\n\nTroop 8 Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI)\n\nSince the establishment of the West Virginia State Police, 40 officers have died while on duty.\n\n\n\n"}

Made of wood and originally intended to be used as a circus, the theatre was managed by the parents of the music hall comedian Dan Leno in 1883, who regularly performed there in the early stages of his career. Leno's lease came to an end in 1884 and the theatre burnt down in 1893. This was replaced by City Theatre but this was demolished six years later to make way for what is now the Lyceum.\n\nBuilt to a traditional proscenium arch design, the Lyceum is the only surviving theatre outside London designed by the theatre architect W.G.R. Sprague and the last example of an Edwardian auditorium in Sheffield. The statue on top of the Lyceum Theatre is Mercury, son of Zeus and Maia.\n\nBy the late 1950s, the Lyceum was experiencing financial difficulties and by 1966 bingo callers were keeping the rumoured threat of demolition at bay. The theatre closed in 1969 and, despite being granted Grade II listed status in 1972, planning permission was sought for its demolition in 1975. The building was saved in part due to campaigning by the Hallamshire Historic Buildings Society.\n\nOver the years the building changed ownership many times, being used variously as a bingo hall and a rock concert venue. By the 1980s, the interior was in a state of disrepair. The theatre was bought by two Sheffield businessmen in 1985, with financial support from Sheffield City Council, and it was reclassified to Grade II* listed status. Between 1988 and 1990 the Lyceum was completely restored at a cost of £12 million.\n\nThe theatre reopened in 1990 and now serves as a venue for touring West End productions, as well as locally produced shows. It is part of the Sheffield Theatres complex with the neighbouring Crucible Theatre and the Crucible Studio.\n\nThe Lyceum presents one of Sheffield's annual Christmas pantomimes. For many years the pantomime attracted prominent actors and variety turns and visiting producers in the months between Christmas Eve and Easter. In the 1940s, the Lyceum began to produce its own pantomime and was soon bringing in stars of radio such as Morecambe and Wise, Harry Secombe and Frankie Howerd.\n\nHowever, closure of the Lyceum meant that after the final pantomime performance in March 1969, Sheffield's pantomimes took place in the neighbouring Crucible. The pantomime returned to the Lyceum in 1990s, as touring production companies were now using the venue.\n\nIn 2007, Sheffield Theatres replaced the touring companies by starting co-production with Evolution Pantomimes. Their first show \"Cinderella\" was followed by \"Aladdin\" in 2008 and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" in 2009.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2255337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255337", "title": "Action role-playing game", "text": "Action role-playing game\n\nAction role-playing video games (often abbreviated action RPG or ARPG) are a subgenre of role-playing video games. The games emphasize real-time combat where the player has direct control over the characters as opposed to turn or menu-based combat while still having a focus on character's Stats in order to determine relative strength and abilities. These games often use action game combat systems similar to hack and slash or shooter games. Action role-playing games may also incorporate action-adventure games, which include a mission system and RPG mechanics, or massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) with real-time combat systems.\n\nAllgame listed the following games released prior to 1984 as action RPGs: \"Temple of Apshai\" (1979) and its sequel \"Gateway to Apshai\" (1983), \"Beneath the Pyramids\" for the Apple II (1980), \"Bokosuka Wars\" (1983), and \"Sword of Fargoal\" (1983). Jeremy Parish of USgamer claimed that \"Adventure\" (1980) was an action RPG. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton claimed that the Intellivision games \"\" (1982) and \"Treasure of Tarmin\" (1983) were action RPGs. Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade notes that \"Adventure\" lacked RPG mechanics such as experience points and permanent character growth, and argues that \"Gateway to Apshai\" is \"the earliest game I'd feel comfortable calling an action-RPG\" but notes that \"it doesn't fit neatly into our modern genre classifications,\" though came closer than \"Bokosuka Wars\" released the same year.\n\nJeremy Parish of 1UP.com argues that Japanese developers created a new brand of action role-playing game; these new Japanese games combined the role-playing genre with arcade-style action and action-adventure elements. Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade also traces the genre's roots to Japan, noting that the \"Western game industry of the time had a tendency to treat action games and RPGs as separate things for separate demographics\".\n\nJeremy Parish argues that action RPGs were popularized in Japan by \"The Tower of Druaga\". It was released for arcades in June 1984, and was intended as a \"fantasy version of \"Pac-Man\", with puzzles to solve, monsters to battle, and hidden treasure to find\". Its success in Japan inspired the development of \"Dragon Slayer\" (1984) and \"Hydlide\" (1984). \"Dragon Slayer\", \"Hydlide\" and \"Courageous Perseus\" (1984) \"vie for position as genre precedent\" according to John Szczepaniak, and there was an ongoing rivalry developing between the \"Dragon Slayer\" and \"Hydlide\" series over the years. \"The Tower of Druaga\", \"Dragon Slayer\" and \"Hydlide\" were influential in Japan, where they influenced later action RPGs such as \"Ys\", as well as \"The Legend of Zelda\".\n\nFalcom's \"Dragon Slayer\", created by Yoshio Kiya, is \"the very first action-RPG ever made\" according to GameSetWatch. Originally released for the PC-8801 computer in September 1984, it abandoned the command-based battles of earlier role-playing games in favor of real-time hack-and-slash combat that required direct input from the player, alongside puzzle-solving elements. In contrast to earlier turn-based roguelikes, \"Dragon Slayer\" was a dungeon-crawl role-playing game using real-time, action-oriented combat, combined with traditional role-playing mechanics. \"Dragon Slayer's\" overhead action role-playing formula was used in many later games.\n\nT&E Soft's \"Hydlide\", released in December 1984, was created by Tokihiro Naito, who was influenced by \"The Tower of Druaga\". It was the first action RPG with an overworld. The game was immensely popular in Japan, selling 2 million copies across all platforms. According to John Szczepaniak, it \"cannot be overstated how influential Hydlide was on the ARPGs which followed it\". The same year, \"Courageous Perseus\" was also one of the earliest action RPGs.\n\n\"\", released in 1985 (billed as a \"new type of real-time role-playing game\"), was an action role-playing game including many character stats and a large quest. It also incorporated a side-scrolling view during exploration and an overhead view during battle, and an early \"Karma\" morality system where the character's Karma meter will rise if he commits sin (killing \"good\" enemies), which in turn causes the temples to refuse to level him up. \"Xanadu Scenario II\", released in 1986, was an expansion pack, created to expand the content of \"Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu\". \"\" (1985) also featured a morality system. Eurogamer cites \"Fairlight\" (1985) as an early action RPG.\n\nAn important influence on the action RPG genre was the 1986 action-adventure, \"The Legend of Zelda\", which served as the template for many future action RPGs. In contrast to previous action RPGs, such as \"Dragon Slayer\" and \"Hydlide,\" which required the player to bump into enemies in order to attack them, \"The Legend of Zelda\" featured an attack button that animates a sword swing or projectile attack on the screen. It was also an early example of open-world, nonlinear gameplay, and introduced new features such as battery backup saving. These elements have been used in many action RPGs since.\n\nIn 1987, \"\" implemented a more traditional RPG-esque system, including experience points and levels with action game elements. Unlike its predecessor, \"Zelda II\" more closely fits the definition of an action RPG.\n\nAnother \"Metroidvania\"-style action RPG released that year was System Sacom's Sharp X1 computer game \"Euphory\", which was possibly the only \"Metroidvania\"-style multiplayer action RPG produced, allowing two-player cooperative gameplay. The fifth \"Dragon Slayer\" title, \"Sorcerian\", was also released that year. It was a party-based action RPG, with the player controlling a party of four characters at the same time in a side-scrolling view. The game also featured character creation, highly customizable characters, class-based puzzles, and a new scenario system, allowing players to choose from 15 scenarios, or quests, to play through in the order of their choice. It was also an episodic video game, with expansion disks later released offering more scenarios. Falcom also released the of its \"Ys\" series in 1987. While not very popular in the West, the long-running \"Ys\" series has performed strongly in the Japanese market, with many sequels, remakes and ports in the decades that followed its release. Besides Falcom's own \"Dragon Slayer\" series, \"Ys\" was also influenced by \"Hydlide\", from which it borrowed certain mechanics such as health-regeneration.\n\n\"The Faery Tale Adventure\" offered one of the largest worlds at the time, with over 17,000 computer screens without loading times.\n\nIn 1988, Telenet Japan's \"Exile\" series debuted, and was controversial due to its plot, which revolves around a time-traveling Crusades-era Syrian assassin who assassinates various religious/historical figures as well as 20th century political leaders, The gameplay of \"Exile\" included both overhead exploration and side-scrolling combat, and featured a heart monitor to represent the player's Attack Power and Armor Class statistics. Another controversial aspect of the game involved taking drugs (instead of potions) that increase/decrease attributes, but with side effects such as heart-rate increase/decrease or death. Origin Systems, the developer of the \"Ultima\" series, also released an action RPG in 1988, titled \"Times of Lore\", which was inspired by various NES titles, particularly \"The Legend of Zelda\". \"Times of Lore\" inspired several later titles by Origin Systems, such as the 1990 games \"Bad Blood\" (another action RPG based on the same engine) and \"\", based on the same interface.\n\nAlso in 1989, the enhanced remake \"Ys I & II\" was one of the first video games to use CD-ROM, which was utilized to provide enhanced graphics, animated cut scenes, a Red Book CD soundtrack, and voice acting. Its English localization was also one of the first to use voice dubbing. The game received the Game of the Year award from \"OMNI Magazine\" in 1990, as well as other prizes. Another 1989 release, Activision's \"\", attempted to introduce \"Nintendo-style\" action combat to North American computer role-playing games.\n\nIn 1991, Square released \"Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden\", also known as \"Final Fantasy Adventure\" or \"Mystic Quest\" in the West, for the Game Boy. Like \"Crystalis\", the action in \"Seiken Densetsu\" bore a strong resemblance to that of \"Legend of Zelda\", but added more RPG elements. It was one of the first action RPGs to allow players to kill townspeople, though later \"Mana\" games removed this feature. \"Arcus Odyssey\" by Wolf Team (now Namco Tales Studio) was an action RPG that featured an isometric perspective and co-operative multiplayer gameplay.\n\nIn 1993, the second \"Seiken Densetsu\" game, \"Secret of Mana\", received considerable acclaim, for its innovative pausable real-time action battle system, and its innovative cooperative multiplayer gameplay, where the second or third players could drop in and out of the game at any time, rather than players having to join the game at the same time. The game has remained influential through to the present day, with its ring menu system still used in modern games and its cooperative multiplayer mentioned as an influence on games such as \"Dungeon Siege III\" (2011).\n\nMost other such games, however, used a side-scrolling perspective typical of beat 'em ups, such as the \"Princess Crown\" series, including \"Odin Sphere\" and \"\". Princess Crown had a more cartoon like visual appeal. It still had quality visuals due to the George Kamitani style.\n\n\"LandStalker's\" 1997 spiritual successor \"Alundra\" is considered \"one of the finest examples of action/RPG gaming\", combining platforming elements and challenging puzzles with an innovative storyline revolving around entering people's dreams and dealing with mature themes.\n\nIn late 1987, FTL Games released \"Dungeon Master\", a dungeon crawler that had a real-time game world and some real-time combat elements (akin to Active Time Battle), requiring players to quickly issue orders to the characters, setting the standard for first-person computer RPGs for several years. It inspired many other developers to make real-time dungeon crawlers, such as \"Eye of the Beholder\" and \"\".\n\n\"\", released in 1992, has been cited as the first RPG to feature first-person action in a 3D environment.\n\"Ultima Underworld\" is considered the first example of an immersive sim, a genre that combines elements from other genres to create a game with strong player agency and emergent gameplay, and has influenced many games since its release. The game's influence has been found in \"BioShock\" (2007), and that game's designer, Ken Levine, has stated that \"all the things that I wanted to do and all the games that I ended up working on came out of the inspiration I took from [\"Ultima Underworld\"]\". \"Gears of War\" designer Cliff Bleszinski also cited it as an early influence, stating that it had \"far more impact on me than \"Doom\"\". Other games influenced by \"Ultima Underworld\" include \"\", \"Deus Ex\", \"\", \"\", and \"Half-Life 2\". Toby Gard stated that, when designing \"Tomb Raider\", he \"was a big fan of ... \"Ultima Underworld\" and I wanted to mix that type of game with the sort of polygon characters that were just being showcased in \"Virtua Fighter\".\" \"Ultima Underworld\" was also the basis for Looking Glass Technologies' later \"System Shock\".\n\nThe engine was re-used and enhanced for \"Ultima Underworld\"s 1993 sequel, \"\". Looking Glass Studios planned to create a third \"Ultima Underworld\", but Origin rejected their pitches. After Electronic Arts (EA) rejected Arkane Studios' pitch for \"Ultima Underworld III\", the studio instead created a spiritual successor: \"Arx Fatalis\".\n\nAction RPGs were far more common on consoles than computers, due to gamepads being better suited to real-time action than the keyboard and mouse. Though there were attempts at creating action-oriented computer RPGs during the late 1980s and early 1990s, very few saw any success. \"Times of Lore\" was one of the more successful attempts in the American computer market, where there was a generally negative attitude towards combining genres in this way and more of an emphasis on preserving the purity of the RPG genre. For example, a 1991 issue of \"Computer Gaming World\" criticized several computer role-playing games for using \"arcade\" or \"Nintendo-style\" action combat, including \"Ys\", \"Sorcerian,\" \"Times of Lore,\" and \"Prophecy\".\n\nThe 1988 Origin Systems title \"Times of Lore\" was an action RPG with an icon-based point-and-click interface. \"Bad Blood\", another Origin Systems game from 1990, would use the same interface. The designers were inspired by console titles, particularly \"The Legend of Zelda\", to make their interface more accessible.\n\nThe 1994 title \"Ultima VIII\" used mouse controls and attempted to add precision jumping sequences reminiscent of a \"Mario\" platform game, though reactions to the game's mouse-based combat were mixed. In 1996 Blizzard's \"Diablo\" was released and became massively successful. It was an action RPG that used a point-and-click interface and offered gamers a free online service to play with others that maintained the same rules and gameplay.\n\n\"Diablo\"s effect on the market was significant, inspiring many imitators. Its impact was such that the term \"action RPG\" has come to be more commonly used for \"Diablo\"-style games rather than \"Zelda-\"style games, with \"The Legend of Zelda\" itself recategorized as an action-adventure.\n\nShooter-based action RPGs include \"Strife\" (1996), System Shock 2\" (1999), \"the \"Deus Ex\" series (2000 onwards) by Ion Storm, Bungie's \"Destiny\" (2014), Irem's \"Steambot Chronicles\" (2005), Square Enix's third-person shooter RPG \"\" (2006), which introduced an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to \"Resident Evil 4\", and the MMO vehicular combat game \"Auto Assault\" (2006) by NetDevil and NCsoft. Other action RPGs featured both hack and slash and shooting elements, with the use of both guns (or in some cases, bow and arrow or aerial combat) and melee weapons, including Cavia's flight-based \"Drakengard\" series (2003 to 2005), and Level-5's \"Rogue Galaxy\" (2005).\n\nOther RPS games include the \"Mass Effect\" series (2007 onwards), \"Fallout 3\" and subsequent \"Fallout\" titles (2008 onwards), \"\" (2008), and \"Borderlands\" (2009). \"Borderlands\" developer Gearbox Software has dubbed it as a \"role-playing shooter\" due to the heavy RPG elements within the game, such as quest-based gameplay and also its character traits and leveling system. \"Half-Minute Hero\" (2009) is an RPG shooter featuring self-referential humour and a 30-second time limit for each level and boss encounter. Other recent action role-playing games with shooter elements include the 2010 titles \"Alpha Protocol\" by Obsidian Entertainment and \"The 3rd Birthday\", the third game in the \"Parasite Eve\" series, features a unique blend of action RPG, real-time tactical RPG, survival horror and third-person tactical shooter elements.\n\nMore recent shooter-based RPGs include Imageepoch's post-apocapytic \"Black Rock Shooter\" (2011)\",\" which employs both first-person and third-person shooter elements, and Square Enix's \"Final Fantasy XV\" (2016)\",\" which features both hack and slash and third-person shooter elements.\n"}

It is the second highest-ranking official in state government. The lieutenant governor is elected on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term. Official duties dictated to the lieutenant governor under the present New York Constitution are to serve as president of the state senate, serve as acting governor in the absence of the governor from the state or the disability of the governor, or to become governor in the event of the governor's death, resignation or removal from office via impeachment. Additional statutory duties of the lieutenant governor are to serve on the New York Court for the Trial of Impeachments, the State Defense Council, and on the board of trustees of the College of Environmental Science and Forestry.\n\nThe office is currently held by Kathy Hochul.\n\nMost lieutenant governors take on other duties as assigned to them by the governor. For example, Mary Donohue took on duties in the areas of small business, school violence, and land-use planning, along with serving as a surrogate speaker for the governor in upstate New York. Donohue's predecessor, Betsy McCaughey Ross, worked on Medicare and education policy, prior to her falling out with Governor George Pataki. Democrat Stan Lundine, who served under Governor Mario Cuomo, was active on technology and housing issues during his two terms in office.\n\nWhile governor and lieutenant governor are elected by a single joint vote in the general election, they run separately in the primaries. In 1982, Mario Cuomo won the Democratic nomination for governor, but his running mate H. Carl McCall lost the lieutenant governor nomination to Alfred DelBello. DelBello was elected with Cuomo, but resigned in 1985, complaining that Cuomo did not give him anything to do.\n\nMcCaughey Ross had been elected on a ticket with Pataki in 1994 but soon broke with him on state policy. He dropped her from his 1998 re-election ticket, and she became a Democrat and ran for governor on the Liberal ticket. \n\nPrior to Paterson succeeding Eliot Spitzer on March 17, 2008, the last lieutenant governor to succeed to the governorship was Malcolm Wilson following the 1973 resignation of Nelson Rockefeller when he became the vice president of the United States. Mario Cuomo was the last lieutenant governor to be elected governor.\n\nIn the 1994 statewide election, Lt. Gov. Stan Lundine sought reelection on the Democratic ticket with Gov. Mario Cuomo. Lieutenant Governor Lundine was unopposed for renomination on the Democratic ticket. In the Republican primary, academic Betsy McCaughey was the only candidate, as nominated by the Republican State Convention. Ms. McCaughey was selected as a running mate by State Sen. George Pataki. Pataki reportedly also considered sofa bed heiress Bernadette Castro and Assembly Minority Leader Clarence Rappalya as possible running mates as well. The Pataki/McCaughey ticket defeated the Cuomo/Lundine ticket in the general election.\n\nIn 1997, following a falling out for most of their term, Gov. George Pataki dropped Lieutenant Governor Betsy McCaughey Ross from the ticket. Pataki embarked on a year long process to select a new running mate for lieutenant governor. After reportedly considering State Parks Commissioner Bernadette Castro, State Sen. Mary Lou Rath and Erie County Comptroller Nancy Naples, Pataki nominated Judge Mary Donohue as his running mate. Judge Donohue was unopposed for the Republican nomination. Several candidates entered the race for the Democratic lieutenant governor nomination. State Sen. Anthony Nanula of Buffalo reportedly considered the race and then decided against running. Plattsburgh Mayor Clyde Rabideau, Brighton Town Supervisor Sandra Frankel, Buffalo Councilwoman Barbra Kavenugh, and attorney Charlie King of Rockland County announced their candidacies for the nomination. Councilwoman Kavanaugh withdrew from the race at the Democratic State Convention. Mayor Rabideau was selected as a running mate by New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone and Supervisor Frankel was selected as a running mate by Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes during the state convention. Mr. King received enough support to qualify for the September primary ballot and continued his race. Lieutenant Governor McCaughey Ross, who was running for governor, reportedly considered Assemblyman Sam Hoyt as a running mate. As the Liberal Party nominee, Lieutenant Governor McCaughey Ross was paired with Jonathan Reiter as a running mate. Independence Party nominee Tom Golisano ran with Laureen Oliver. The Green Party nominee actor Al Lewis ran with Alice Green.\n\nSupervisor Frankel won the Democratic lieutenant governor primary and was paired in the general election with Speaker Vallone. The Pataki/Donohue ticket defeated the Vallone/Frankel and the Golisano/Oliver tickets.\n\nReports in early 2002 said that Governor Pataki was considered dropping Lieutenant Governor Donohue from the ticket and asking her to run for New York State Attorney General instead. The reports said he had considered New York Secretary of State Randy Daniels and Erie County Executive Joel Giambra as replacement running mates, but eventually Lieutenant Governor Donohue would join Governor Pataki again on the Republican ticket.\n\nThe Democratic field started with 1998 nominee Sandra Frankel, 1998 candidate Charlie King, businessman Dennis Mehiel, Westchester County Legislature Chairman George Latimer and former New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner Jane Steiner Hoffman. Commissioner Hoffman dropped out of the race for medical reasons, and both Latimer and Frankel dropped out for party unity. State Comptroller Carl McCall selected Mr. Mehiel as his running mate and former HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo selected Mr. King as a running mate. A week before the September primary, Secretary Cuomo and Mr. King withdrew from their primaries and endorsed the McCall and Mehiel ticket.\n\nThe Independence Party had a contested primary battle for lieutenant governor. Lieutenant Governor Donohue faced an Independence Party member aligned with gubernatorial candidate Tom Golisano in the primary, but won the primary, while Governor Pataki lost the Independence primary for governor to Golisano. This made Donohue the running mate for both Pataki and Golisano in November.\n\nThe Green Party nominated Jennifer Daniels for lieutenant governor on a ticket with Stanley Aronowitz.\n\nThe Pataki/Donohue ticket defeated the McCall and Mehiel and the Golisano and Donohue tickets in November.\n\nLieutenant Governor Donohue announced that she would not run for a third term in 2006. The race to succeed her drew eight major party candidates. State Senate Minority Leader David Paterson of Harlem won the Democratic nomination. Rockland County Executive C. Scott Vanderhoef won the Republican nomination. The Green Party candidate was Alison Duncan.\n\nFormer candidates for the Democratic lieutenant governor nomination were attorney Leecia Eve of Buffalo, Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli of Nassau County, Doctor Jon Cohen of Nassau County and Wappinger Town Supervisor Joseph Ruggiero of Dutchess County, New York. Former candidates for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor were New York Secretary of State Christopher Jacobs of Buffalo, Town Supervisor Tim Demler of Wheatfield, and former State Senator Nancy Larraine Hoffmann of Madison County. The Spitzer/Paterson ticket defeated the Faso/Vanderhoef ticket in the election for Governor and Lieutenant Governor on November 7.\n\nAfter Lieutenant Governor David Paterson succeeded to the governorship of New York after Eliot Spitzer resigned on March 17, 2008, the office of lieutenant governor became vacant. The duties of lieutenant governor were then performed successively by Temporary Presidents of the State Senate Joseph Bruno, Dean Skelos, Malcolm Smith and, during the 2009 New York State Senate leadership crisis, Pedro Espada Jr.\n\nOn July 8, 2009, prior to the recapture of senate control by the Democrats, Governor Paterson appointed Richard Ravitch to the position of lieutenant governor to resolve the month-long political stalemate in the state senate. However, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo warned Paterson before Ravitch's selection that such an appointment would be unconstitutional. Litigation concerning the appointment's constitutionality was filed in New York State's courts by the Republican Senate caucus on July 9. A preliminary ruling by Justice William R. LaMarca on July 21 upheld AG Cuomo. On August 20, a four-judge panel of the Appellate Division (2nd Dept.) rejected unanimously the appointment. However, on September 22, in a \"stunning reversal,\" the New York Court of Appeals, ruled in a 4-3 decision that Paterson's appointment was constitutional.\n\n, seven former lieutenant governors of New York were alive. The list includes lieutenant governors who later became governors. The most recent death of a former lieutenant governor of New York was that of Alfred DelBello (served from 1983 to 1985, born 1934) on May 15, 2015.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2255343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255343", "title": "Takeda clan", "text": "Takeda clan\n\nThe was a Japanese clan active from the late Heian period until the late 16th century. The clan was historically based in Kai Province in present-day Yamanashi Prefecture. The clan was known for their honorable actions under the rule of Takeda Shingen, one of the most famous rulers of the period.\n\n\nNobushige, Nobumitsu, Nobuyoshi, Nobutora, Harunobu (Shingen), Katsuyori\n\nThe Takeda are descendants of Emperor Seiwa (858–876) and are a branch of the Minamoto clan (Seiwa Genji), by Minamoto no Yoshimitsu (1056–1127), son of the \"Chinjufu-shōgun\" Minamoto no Yoriyoshi (988-1075), and brother to the famous Minamoto no Yoshiie (1039–1106). Minamoto no Yoshikiyo (1075–1149), son of Yoshimitsu, was the first to take the name of Takeda.\n\nIn the 12th century, at the end of the Heian period, the Takeda family controlled Kai Province. Along with a number of other families, they aided their cousin Minamoto no Yoritomo against the Taira clan in the Genpei War (1180–85). When Minamoto no Yoritomo was first defeated at Ishibashiyama (1181), Takeda Nobuyoshi (1128–86) was applied for help and the Takeda sent an army of 25,000 men to support Yoritomo. Takeda Nobumitsu (1162–1248), son of Nobuyoshi, fought against the Taira, and distinguished himself in the Battle of Ichinotani (1184). He also fought against Kiso Yoshinaka (1184), against the Northern Fujiwara (1189) and against Wada Yoshimori (1213). During the Jōkyū War, he helped the Hōjō, and led 50,000 soldiers as Daishogun of the Tosando , and in reward received the governorship of Aki province (1221). Takeda Nobuhide (1413–40), eldest son of the Takeda Nobushige (1390–1465) shugo of Aki, helped the 6th shogun Ashikaga Yoshinori (1394–1441) against the revolt of Isshiki Yoshitsura (1440) and was granted the governorship of Wakasa province. Takeda Nobukata (1420–71) inherited the titles of shugo of Wakasa from his brother Nobuhide who died childless, and that of shugo of Aki from his father Nobushige. During the Ōnin War (1467–77) he occupied Tango province that belonged to Isshiki Yoshinao, and was appointed shugo of Tango (1469) by the bakufu. His brother Takeda Kuninobu (1437–90) received the titles of shugo of Aki, Wakasa and Tango provinces, but lost Tango in 1474. Until the Sengoku period, the Takeda were \"shugo\" of Kai, Aki and Wakasa provinces.\n\nImmediately prior to the Sengoku period, the Takeda helped to suppress the Rebellion of Uesugi Zenshū (1416–1417). Uesugi Zenshū (d. 1417) was the \"kanrei\" chief advisor to Ashikaga Mochiuji, an enemy of the central Ashikaga shogunate and the Kantō kubō governor-general of the Kantō region. Mochiuji, lord of the Uesugi clan, made a reprisal against the Takeda clan in 1415. This reprisal began a rivalry between the Uesugi and Takeda clans which would last roughly 150 years until the destruction of the Takeda clan at the end of the Sengoku period. While this rivalry existed, the Takeda and the Uesugi still had a huge amount of respect for one another.\n\nTakeda Harunobu (1521 – 1573) succeeded his father Nobutora in 1540 and became \"shugo\" lord of Kai Province in present-day Yamanashi Prefecture. In this period the Takeda began to quickly expand from their base in Kai Province. In 1559, Harunobu changed his name to the better-known Takeda Shingen. He faced the Hōjō clan a number of times, and most of his expansion was to the north, where he fought his most famous battles against Uesugi Kenshin. This series of regional skirmishes is known as the Battles of Kawanakajima. The battles began in 1553, and the best known and severest among them was fought on September 10, 1561.\n\nShingen is famous for his tactical genius, and innovations, though some historians have argued that his tactics were not particularly impressive nor revolutionary. Nevertheless, Shingen is perhaps most famous for his use of the cavalry charge at the Battle of Mikatagahara. The strength of Shingen's new tactic became so famous that the Takeda army came to be known as the \"kiba gundan\" (騎馬軍団), or 'mounted army'. Up until the mid-16th century and Shingen's rise to power, mounted \"samurai\" were primarily archers. There was already a trend at this time towards larger infantry-based armies, including a large number of foot archers. In order to defeat these missile troops, Shingen transformed his \"samurai\" from archers to lancers.\n\nShingen died in on May 13, 1573, at age 53 from illness. His son Takeda Katsuyori (1546–1582) effectively succeeded Shingen though the nominal head of the family was his grandson Takeda Nobukatsu; Katsuyori continued Shingen's aggressive expansion plan south and westward and was initially successful, briefly achieving the largest extent of Takeda rule. However, he was defeated in the Battle of Nagashino in 1575 by Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu.\n\nAfter Nagashino, the Takeda clan fell into sharp decline as it had lost many of its most notable samurai during the battle. Katsuyori's position within the clan also became precarious (as he did not fully inherit the clan leadership position); in 1582, two of his relatives defected to the Oda/Tokugawa alliance and Nobunaga succeeded in destroying the Takeda clan shortly thereafter. The campaign saw most of the Takeda followers simply abandoning Katsuyori and the other Takeda family members to their fate. The clan was effectively eliminated, although descendants of the Takeda clan would take prominent positions in the Tokugawa shogunate, established in 1603.\n\nTakeda is also a fairly common family name in modern Japan, though it is unlikely that everyone with the Takeda name is descended from this noble house (several divisions of the family have the Takeda name).\n\nIn fact, most of the real descendants of the Takeda had a different name when they created a cadet branch. During the Tokugawa period, several \"daimyō\" families were direct descendants of the Takeda.\n\nIn 1868, these \"daimyō\" families were :\n\n\nIn 1868, two branches named Takeda were also ranked among the \"Kōke\" (the High Families). This title was given to descendants of great dispossessed \"daimyo\" families of the Kamakura period to Sengoku period such as the Takeda, the Kyōgoku, the Rokkaku, the Ōtomo, the Toki, the Isshiki and the Hatakeyama clans. They received a pension from the shogunate, and had privileged missions confided to them.\n\nThree major branches of the Takeda clan were established across Japan along with other smaller branches. Due to the establishment of cadet branches, the main Takeda clan in Kai Province is also referred to as the Kai Takeda clan.\n\nThe Aki Takeda clan, established in Aki Province in the present-day western part of Hiroshima Prefecture.\nTakeda Nobumitsu (1162–1248) received the governorship of Aki province in 1221.\nTakeda Nobutake († 1362) was the last Takeda \"Shugo\" of the two provinces of Kai and Aki. His elder son Nobunari received Kai and the younger Ujinobu received Aki province.\n\nThe Aki Takeda were granted the governorship of Wakasa province in 1440. The Wakasa Takeda clan was established in Wakasa Province in present-day southern Fukui Prefecture, and separates from Aki in 1500 , when Takeda Motonobu (1461-1521) ruled Wakasa, while his uncle Takeda Mototsuna (1441-1505) ruled Aki. The Wakasa Takeda were known for their patronage of the arts and developing the Takeda school of military etiquette.\n\nThe Kazusa Takeda clan, established at the beginning of the Sengoku period in Kazusa Province in the present-day central area of Chiba Prefecture. Along with the Satomi clan of Awa Province in the southern part of present-day Chiba Prefecture the two clan replaced the dominance of the Chiba clan in the region. The Kazusa Takeda are also known as the Mariyatsu Takeda, a reference to their base of power, Mariyatsu Castle.\n\nThe \"Kōshū Hatto\", composed at some point in the 15th century, is the code of law of the Takeda family, while the \"Kōyō Gunkan\", composed largely by Kōsaka Masanobu in the mid-16th century, is an epic poem recording the family's history and Shingen's innovations in military tactics.\n\n\nTakeda is a playable faction in \"\" and \"Shogun 2\".\n\nTakeda is a playable nation in \"Europa Universalis IV\".\n\nTakeda Shingen and his peasant doppelgänger are the main subjects of \"Kagemusha\", directed by Akira Kurosawa. The film was partly financed and produced with the help of Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, who were shocked to discover that Kurosawa had difficulty securing funding in his native country.\n\n"}

After not being accepted for a National Football League combine, he focused on a career in wrestling and participated in the fourth season of \"Tough Enough\". Despite not winning, he signed a developmental contract with WWE, and was assigned to their developmental territory, Deep South Wrestling, where he wrestled as \"Big Time\" Nick Mitchell. He was later moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) where he joined the Spirit Squad faction. After the Spirit Squad were called up to the \"Raw\" roster, they debuted in January 2006, and won the World Tag Team Championship three months later. Following the split of the team, Mitchell was released from his WWE contract in May 2007. Mitchell then began a career in mixed martial arts.\n\nIn high school, Mitchell played four years of varsity football, on both sides of the ball. He received a full scholarship to Northwestern State University of the Southland Conference, but was expelled for fighting during his freshman season. After attending Blinn College in Bryan, Texas for two semesters, Mitchell joined the Beaumont Drillers of the National Indoor Football League in 2003. After a season with them, he attended a National Football League combine, but was told to go home after officials found out he had been expelled from college for fighting.\n\nMitchell took part in the fourth season of World Wrestling Entertainment's reality series \"Tough Enough\" in 2004. He was the first to be eliminated. Despite not winning, he was still signed to a WWE developmental contract and assigned to the company's developmental territory, Deep South Wrestling. Several other competitors from \"Tough Enough\" were also signed, including Daniel Puder, Mike Mizanin, and Marty Wright, but near the end of 2006, Mitchell and Mizanin were the only two left on the main WWE roster. He began wrestling under the name \"Big Time\" Nick Mitchell, and competed against wrestlers including Kid Kash and Johnny Parisi. He later suffered a knee injury, and although it was feared that he had torn his ACL, he was moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) where he joined The Spirit Squad. Within days of his debut, the Squad was called up to the main WWE roster.\n\nAs part of The Spirit Squad, a group consisting of five wrestlers who used the in-ring personas of male cheerleaders, he adopted the name Mitch. As a result of his ACL injury, his ability to wrestle was curtailed and Mitch spent the first few months of his time in the Spirit Squad in a non-wrestling role. On January 23, 2006, they had their WWE television debut as a group, appearing on \"Raw\" and helping Jonathan Coachman win a Royal Rumble qualifying match against Jerry \"The King\" Lawler by performing cheers for Coachman and distracting Lawler. They later became a part of the ongoing scripted feud between WWE chairman Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels. The villainous McMahon brought in the Squad to attack Michaels on numerous occasions, including placing them in multiple handicap matches.\n\nThey also wrestled in the tag team division, and on April 3, on \"Raw\", won the World Tag Team Championship when Kenny and Mikey defeated Big Show and Kane, with outside help from the other three Squad members as they attacked The Big Show in order to gain the advantage. After winning the championship, all five members of the team were recognized as the champions, allowing any combination of them to defend the championship.\n\nThree weeks later, McMahon scheduled another handicap match, with The Spirit Squad facing Michaels. The match never started, however; instead The Spirit Squad attacked Michaels, ripping apart his ring attire and, as part of the storyline, shattering his knee with a steel chair. McMahon then called Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer; however, Kenny snatched the sledgehammer away, disrespecting Triple H, which led to him attacking the group. Triple H and Michaels revived D-Generation X (DX), since their teased reunion in 2002, and as a team began a feud with the Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric pranks on the team and the McMahons (Vince and Shane), as well as defeating The Spirit Squad in handicap matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII\".\n\nDuring their feud with DX and their alignment with McMahon, the team also wrestled other teams in \"Raw\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s tag division over their World Tag Team Championship. The group successfully defended the tag team championship against the teams of Jim Duggan and Eugene, Charlie Haas and Viscera, and Snitsky and Val Venis. They then entered a lengthy feud with The Highlanders, whom they eventually defeated to retain the title at Unforgiven.\n\nThe Squad as a whole later began a losing streak with separate members losing singles matches to Ric Flair on consecutive episodes of \"Raw\". After two consecutive losses to the debuting Cryme Tyme, Kenny attacked Mikey on the October 23 episode of \"Raw\" and announced that he was going to defeat Flair. Kenny was successful, despite Flair attempting to even the odds by bringing other WWE Legends, Dusty Rhodes, Sgt. Slaughter, and \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper, to the ring with him. It was then announced that Flair and a legend, selected by interactive voting, would wrestle the team for the World Tag Team Championship at the Cyber Sunday pay-per-view in early November. The fans chose Piper, and he and Flair defeated Kenny and Mikey to win the championship.\n\nThe group was \"killed off\" on the November 27 \"Raw\" after they were defeated in a five-on-three match by Flair and DX. Later that night, in a backstage segment, DX placed all members into a crate stamped \"OVW, Louisville, Kentucky\", a reference to the developmental territory from which the Squad had come.\n\nMitchell was released from his WWE contract on May 15, 2007.\n\nAfter being released by WWE, Mitchell began training for a career in mixed martial arts (MMA) under Rocky Long, a former mixed martial artist. He made his MMA debut on April 9, 2010, losing to future UFC star Derrick Lewis via second round technical knockout. Mitchell was set to fight again on December 11, 2010, but pulled out at the last minute due to an injury.\n\nHe graduated from The Woodlands High School in 2001. Mitchell played four years of varsity American football in high school, and received a full scholarship to Northwestern State University. During his freshman season, however, he was expelled for getting into a fight. Mitchell then spent two semesters at Blinn College in Bryan, Texas.\n\nIn 2007 he and his girlfriend, Torrie Wilson, started a business together, called \"Officially Jaded\", a fashion boutique. The couple began dating in mid-2006. The couple separated in 2011.\n\nAs a professional wrestler, Mitchell suffered numerous injuries, including damaging a disc in his neck and injuring his knee, as well as breaking his nose three times within one month.\n\n\nMitch defended the championship with either Kenny, Johnny, Nicky, or Mikey under the Freebird Rule.\n\n"}

Her siblings were the future Edward III, King of England, John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall, and Eleanor of Woodstock.\n\nIn accordance with the Treaty of Northampton, Joan was married on 17 July 1328 to David, the son and heir of Robert the Bruce, at Berwick-upon-Tweed. She was seven years old and he was four. Their marriage lasted 34 years, but it was childless and apparently loveless.\n\nAfter the victory of Edward III of England and his protégé Edward Balliol at the Battle of Halidon Hill near Berwick-upon-Tweed in July 1333, David and Joan were sent for safety to France. They reached Boulogne-sur-Mer in May 1334, where they were received by Philip VI, her mother's cousin. Little is known about the life of the Scottish king and queen in France, except that they took up residence at Château Gaillard and Philip treated them with regard.\n\nMeanwhile, David's representatives had obtained the upper hand in Scotland, and David and Joan were thus enabled to return in June 1341, when he took the reins of government into his own hands. David II was taken prisoner at the Battle of Neville's Cross in County Durham on 17 October 1346, and remained imprisoned in England for eleven years. Although Edward III allowed Joan to visit her husband in the Tower of London a few times, she did not become pregnant. After his release in 1357, she decided to remain in England. Joan was close to her mother, whom she nursed during her last days.\n\nJoan died in 1362, aged 41, at Hertford Castle, Hertfordshire. She was buried in Christ Church Greyfriars, London, which was heavily bombed in the Blitz. No trace of her tomb now survives.\n\n"}

Later this unit was redesignated a General Service Regiment. The unit was formed from some regular Army officers and enlisted men, trained in the United States, then shipped overseas early in World War II to England. They were the vanguard of many others to follow, including infantry and armored troops. Their purpose was to build facilities in preparation for those to follow. After the Normandy Invasion, they followed the front lines constructing roads, railroad bridges, hospitals, and other infrastructure needed by the advancing Armies. Continuing through until surrender by Germany in 1945, the unit stayed on as part of the Army of Occupation. Many of the troops in the units were among those who were overseas for the longest periods of all in World War II.\n\nThe unit formed and trained at Camp Claiborne Louisiana, in May 1942. Engineer \"Special\" and \"General\" Service Regiments would replace the old combat battalion unit structure with multipurpose skills. These large regimental units would have heavier engineer equipment, and consist of officers, non-commissioned officers and enlisted men who had experience in engineering or construction jobs. The best construction skills available in the country would be used to build these units.\n\nThe commanding officer through the formation and most of the service during World War II was Colonel Helmer Swenholt, a 1911 graduate of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\n\nThe Chief of Army Engineers ordered Colonel Swenholt to recruit skilled personnel from construction in an organized unit. Some were recruited from Army Corps of Engineer Districts in the Omaha and Kansas City Districts. Others came from various other locations throughout the Midwest. An infantry cadre of seven officers and seventy-three enlisted men formed the nucleus of the unit in May, 1942.\n\nAdditional personnel arrived very quickly. The activities in the first months were very basic training and indoctrination into military life, since these citizen-soldiers already had experience in construction and engineering. They lived in tents and trained for six weeks in basic infantry training, including marches, rifle training, demolition training, identification of gases (e.g. mustard gas) and proper equipment, close order drill, etc. Their time at Camp Claiborne was relatively short as they were needed to ship overseas very early in the War.\n\nThree separate trains were needed for their transfer to Camp Kilmer, a (then) new Army camp named after the American journalist and poet Joyce Kilmer. By this time the regiment had grown to full strength consisting of 1,239 men and 52 officers. They arrived at Camp Kilmer at 1655 hours on 22 July 1942.\n\nThe purpose of their time at Kilmer was to receive final medical evaluations, vaccinations, and final preparations before shipping overseas. The unit shipped overseas to England on 6 August 1942.\n\nTask Force #38 left 6 August 1942 bound for Greenock, Scotland in the British Isles with the USS Arkansas (BB-33) as flagship, fourteen destroyers as escorts with twelve transports including USAT Argentina, carrying the 332nd. The convoy arrived there 17 August 1942.\n\nUpon reaching Scotland, 332nd travelled by rail to their first destination, Newport.\n\nThe 332nd initially was involved to build bases for the coming troops in preparation for the North Africa campaign and D-Day in World War II.\n\nIn their first 1–2 months they built base camps for the Regiment, first from tents but eventually to more permanent Nissen huts. Training was conducted on how to build Bailey bridges. A depot was constructed at Thatcham. This depot was designed as a staging area for the American Army for assembly and shipping of equipment, supplies and gear to the western and northern ports of the UK, where ships were loaded for North Africa.\n\nIn order to concentrate engineering resources and to distribute available heavy equipment, the concept of the \"engineer group\" was begun. General John C. H. Lee was pleased with the work performed with the use of the special and general engineer regiments since mid-1942. These were new concepts of army organization for a new type of war. Still, there were engineers with civilian experience that knew that more improvements could be made with the engineer group idea. In this organization five or six engineer units, including regiments, dump truck companies, welding detachments and engineer maintenance companies would work together on larger projects. Some army engineer officers were lost to aviation construction battalions for runway construction. The engineer section at Southern Base Command implemented the group idea. Southern Base Engineer Group 2 was organized with Colonel Swenholt as commander 1 August 1943. There was no previous Group 1.\n\nThis unit served with several of the Armies of World War II as it was part of ADSEC (Advanced Section, Communications Zone). ADSEC's mission was to support the U.S. First Army, U.S. Third Army, and U.S. Seventh Army by building bridges, roads and hospitals through France, Belgium and Germany.\n\nThe greatest accomplishment of the 332nd Engineer G. S. Regiment (as a member of ASDEC Engineer Group \"A\") was the reconstruction of the Duisburg-Hochfeld rail bridge, long, over the Rhine River in the record time of six days, fifteen hours and twenty minutes. The site of this bridge was crossing the Rhine River between Duisburg and Rheinhausen, Germany. The railroad bridge was completed 8 May 1945 and was named the \"Victory Bridge\".\n\nIn building the bridge, the Engineer Group had to finish the demolition of the nearby railway bridge. Near the new piers was part of a masonry bridge that looked similar to the Castle Design of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This was a fitting tribute the Army Engineering.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the Occupation Zones were to be organized under the agreed terms of the Potsdam convention. Most of the German Rocket scientists and much of their equipment and plans were evacuated to American occupied areas. In order to conceal some plans from the advancing Red Army, rocket personnel had buried some of the V-2 rocket plans near Bad Sachsa, Germany.\n\nA timetable had been set for the arrival of the Red Army into the area where the plans had been buried. A search party had been organized to recover the plans but no large scale map of the area where the plans were to be found was available to the searchers and no progress was made.\n\nOn 21 June 1945 Dr. Richard Porter and Major Robert Staver drove from the Nordhausen area to Kassel, Germany where elements of the 332nd Engineer Regiment were located. They persuaded the regiment's executive officer to send out a search team. \"Werner Von Braun visited the 332nd regimental headquarters on Friday June 29\".\n\nThe regiment remained in Germany in the Allied Occupation Zones in Germany under the command of the U.S. Fifteenth Army, later being deactivated in 1949. By May 1946 the 332nd was actively involved in rebuilding the airstrip at Wiesbaden. At the time it was known as Fliegerhorst Wiesbaden. It came to be called Wiesbaden Army Airfield (WAAF) and is still in operation today.\n\nAfter V-E day, the Army was interested in conditions affecting the morale of the troops in the Occupation Zones. To meet the needs of the troops the chief of special services offered programs with recreational athletics. Soldiers could engage in boxing, football, baseball, softball, tennis, golf, track & field, badminton, bowling, swimming, archery and horseshoe pitching. These activities fell under the Army Sports Program.\n\nIn June 1950 the unit was reactivated and sent overseas during the Korean War. It was deactivated in August 1953 for the last time.\n\nSpecific:\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}

Medals and similar awards are stolen for resale, private collection or ransom; some are destroyed for gold bullion. While not common in developed nations, reported instances have drawn wide press coverage, considering notability and public exposure of the victims of the crime.\n\nIn 1985, Olympic medals belonging to swimmer John Konrads were stolen from his home. The medals were recovered in 2009.\n\nIn 2003, Lauren Burns' Olympic gold medal was stolen.\n\nIn December 1979, a medal awarded to Milton Fowler Gregg in 1918, the Victoria Cross, was donated to the Royal Canadian Regiment Museum in London, Ontario, but was stolen from the museum shortly afterwards.\n\nOn January 15, 2009, about 30 valuable medals belonging to a Chilliwack, British Columbia Odd Fellows lodge were stolen. Five of the medals later turned up during a narcotics raid.\n\nIn 2004, Rabindranath Tagore's 1913 Nobel prize medal was stolen. In 2016, a local singer accused of sheltering the thieves was arrested, but the medal could not be recovered. Interrogation revealed that a Bangaldeshi national, along with two Europeans, were involved in the theft. Two replicas, one in gold and one in silver were later presented to Viswa Bharati University by the Swedish government.\n\nIn February 2017, Kailash Satyarthi's 2014 Nobel prize medal was stolen.\n\nPeacetime theft of medals prior to 1980s was quite rare. A well known case occurred on the day of the Decembrist revolt, December 14, 1825. Military governor of Saint Petersburg, Count Miloradovich, was fatally wounded by Pyotr Kakhovsky. The dying Miloradovich was taken to a safe place; when a surgeon arrived there, Miloradovich laid stripped of his military decorations. The marauders remained unidentified.\n\nA black market in Soviet military artifacts boomed in 1980s. The first publicly known case occurred in 1983: retired admiral Georgy Kholostyakov and his wife were murdered at their home by Gennady and Inna Kalinina, with the sole purpose of obtaining the admiral's medals (which included the Golden Star and Order of the Bath). The prosecution, allegedly supervised by Yuri Andropov, connected Kalinins to another murder and 38 other cases of medal theft. Gennady Kalinin was sentenced to death, Inna Kalinina to 15 years. Violent robberies against veterans remain quite rare: in most cases the thieves impersonate social workers, policemen, museum workers and thus obtain access to old veterans' homes without violence.\n\nA massive theft from the Central Armed Forces Museum was identified in 1994 and remains unsolved. In November 2006 Russian government agency requested Sotheby's to halt an upcoming sale of 11 Soviet military awards presumed to be stolen. The medals were later returned to Russia through Interpol. The Central Armed Forces Museum admitted that the medals could have been stolen from them.\n\nDecember 23, 1999, thieves stole the collection of Michel da Vincha, a French citizen and notable collector living in Moscow, which included rare awards of the Russian Empire. Although the police soon recovered the stolen treasures, they were still not returned to Da Vincha.\n\nAccording to \"Trud\", there were two surges in medal thefts in 2000s. The latest one occurred in the first half of 2008, apparently continues as of August 2008 and has not been analyzed completely yet. Victims range from World War II heroes like Yekaterina Demina, the only female Marine of that war, to symphony conductor Veronica Dudarova. A concurrent crime wave was reported in Minsk and Vitebsk, Belarus. The previous crime wave peaked between 2003 and 2006; most public cases include:\n\n\nIn 1985, Kay Miller's Nobel medal for ‘International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War’ was stolen and recovered.\n\nIn 2000, a gold medal was stolen from Matthew Pinsent, British rowing champion, at Heathrow.\n\nIn 2006, more than £23,000 ($45,970 USD) worth of football medals stolen from the home of then Liverpool F.C. goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek were found in the possession of businessman Martin Roche.\n\nOn February 6, 2008, several medals from World War I were stolen from a home in Knoll Hill, Aldington, Kent.\n\nIn October 2012 the Olympic medals of Hannah Macleod and Alex Partridge were stolen at the Mahiki nightclub. Macleod's medal was returned in the mail, but Partridge's medal is still missing.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize medal won by one of the founding fathers of the modern Labour Party, Arthur Henderson, has been stolen in a £150,000 raid at the Lord Mayor’s office in Newcastle on 3 April 2013.\n\nA large collection of medals, trophies and lithographs were stolen from the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2004. The bulk of the collection was sold off on eBay by the thief. Most of the items were returned in 2005 after the museum discovered the theft. The 1912 Olympic wreath and gold medal of Belle Moore are still at large.\n\nIn 2007, the 1939 Nobel Prize medal in physics, awarded to professor Ernest Lawrence was stolen but recovered.\n\nDecember 2, 2007, thieves stole 11 war medals from the QEII Army Memorial Museum in New Zealand. Stolen medals were recovered in February 2008 after paying the bounty, reportedly to the thieves themselves. Three unidentified persons appeared in courts as suspects.\n\n"}

He was heir presumptive to the English throne until the birth of his nephew Edward, the Black Prince.\n\nJohn was born in 1316 at Eltham Palace, Kent. On 6 October 1328, at the age of twelve, he was created Earl of Cornwall. Caught in the throes of the war between his father, Edward II, and his mother, Isabella, his growing years were turbulent. He was passed between his parents and was even held in the Tower of London for a time before his brother, Edward III, led a coup against their mother and assumed his majority.\n\nInformation on John is scant, but by most historical accounts he was highly competent, and highly trusted by Edward. He was named \"Guardian of the Realm\" when Edward III was out of the country, was asked to open Parliament in Edward's absence, and was named Warden of the northern Marches, which gave him virtual autonomy in that portion of England.\n\nAs the younger brother of the English monarch, since early childhood marital negotiations were made for John: in March 1328 Edward III entered into negotiations for a marriage between his brother and María Díaz de Haro, heiress of the Lordship of Biscay, and in December 1335 were made negotiations for a wedding with Joan, Countess of Penthièvre and heiress of the Duchy of Brittany; however, it doesn't seem that any of these arrangements resulted in an official betrothal. At the end, by contract signed on 28 September 1334, John was betrothed with Maria de La Cerda, Lady of Lunel and daughter of Ferdinand de la Cerda (grandson of King Alfonso X of Castile) by his wife Juana Núñez de Lara, Lady of Lara. A dispensation was sought, but the contract was abandoned when relations between Edward and Philippe worsened in late 1334. Marie married Charles d'Évreux at Poissy in April 1335 \n\nAt seventeen he was a key commander in the Battle of Halidon Hill (1333), a devastating defeat for the Scots. Later he commanded an army in the southwest of Scotland that put down resistance to Edward Balliol, whose claims to the Scottish throne were supported by England.\nAccording to Scottish accounts, who view John as a ruthless destroyer, he burned down Lesmahagow Abbey when it was filled with people who had sought sanctuary from the wrath of the English troops. As the Scottish chronicler John of Fordun tells it, this violation of the sacred laws of sanctuary so enraged King Edward III that he killed his own brother in fury. According to modern historian Tom Beaumont James, this tale \"challenges the distinction between history and story.\"\n\nJohn died at Perth, probably from a fever, shortly after turning 20. In January 1337, Edward buried his brother with all honours in a beautiful alabaster-carved tomb in Westminster Abbey, and regularly had masses said for his soul.\n\nAs Earl of Cornwall, John had use of the coat of arms of the kingdom, differenced by a \"bordure France (i.e. azure semy of fleur-de-lys or)\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2255426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255426", "title": "Carl Erskine", "text": "Carl Erskine\n\nCarl Daniel Erskine (born December 13, 1926) is a former right-handed starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers from 1948 through 1959. He was a pitching mainstay on Dodger teams which won five National League pennants, peaking with a season in which he won 20 games and set a World Series record with 14 strikeouts in a single game. Erskine pitched two of the NL's seven no-hitters during the 1950s. Following his baseball career, he was active as a business executive and an author.\n\nHe broke into the majors a year before Don Newcombe, and from 1948–50 was used primarily as a reliever, going 21-10. In 1951, he mixed 19 starts with 27 relief appearances, and went 16-12. Erskine was 14-6 in 1952 with a career-best 2.70 earned run average, then had his 20-win season in 1953, leading the league with a .769 winning percentage along with 187 strikeouts and 16 complete games, all career highs. This was followed by 18-15 in 1954, posting career highs in starts (37) and innings (260-1/3), then by 11-8 in 1955 and 13-11 in 1956.\n\nWhen Newcombe was pitching in the ninth inning of the third game of the playoff with the New York Giants on October 3, 1951, Erskine and Ralph Branca were warming up in the bullpen. On the recommendation of pitching coach Clyde Sukeforth, who thought that Branca had better stuff, Newcombe was relieved by Branca, who then gave up the game-winning home run to Bobby Thomson. Whenever Erskine was asked what his best pitch was, he replied, \"The curveball I bounced in the Polo Grounds bullpen in 1951.\"\n\nErskine, author of two no-hitters (against the Chicago Cubs on June 19, 1952 and the New York Giants on May 12, 1956), was a member of the beloved Dodgers team which won the 1955 World Series for the franchise's first Series title. He appeared in eleven World Series games (1949–52–53-55-56), and made the NL All-Star team in . His 14 strikeouts as the winner of Game 3 of the 1953 Fall Classic – including striking out the side in the ninth inning – broke the Series record of 13 held by Howard Ehmke (1929, Game 1), and stood for 10 years until Sandy Koufax struck out 15 New York Yankees in the first game of the 1963 World Series; but he was ineffective in Games 1 and 6, although he was not charged with the losses. From 1951 through 1956, Erskine won 92 games while losing only 58, which helped the Dodgers to four pennants during the \"Boys of Summer\" era. During his years in Brooklyn, he was affectionately known as \"Oisk\" by the fans with their Brooklyn accents.\n\nIn 1957, Erskine moved to Los Angeles with the team the following year, but lasted only a season and a half. He made his final appearance on June 14, 1959. In a twelve-season career, he posted a 122-78 (.610) record with 981 strikeouts and a 4.00 ERA in 1718.2 innings pitched.\n\nFollowing his retirement as a player, Erskine returned to his native Indiana. He coached at Anderson College for 12 seasons, including four Hoosier Conference championships, and his 1965 squad went 20-5 and reached the NAIA World Series. He had 18 players named to All-Conference teams, and three named as All-American. In 1973, his final season, he coached John Bargfeldt, who later spent three seasons in the minors as a Chicago Cubs prospect. He also became a leader in the community, participating in numerous organizations and businesses, including rising to the presidency of the Star Bank of Anderson, Indiana before easing back to the role of vice chairman of the board. He is devoted to his son Jimmy, who has Down syndrome and lives at home and holds a job nearby at the Hopewell Center for people with developmental difficulties.\n\nTo commemorate Erskine's accomplishments both as a Dodger and as a citizen, a bronze statue was built in front of the Carl D. Erskine Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine Center. Erskine also donated part of his land to the Anderson Community School System to build a new school, which was named Erskine Elementary. Erskine serves as a member of the advisory board of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League players through financial and medical difficulties. In 2002, Erskine Street in Brooklyn was created and named after him.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

It was released on January 16, 2007 at local midnight in Europe and North America, selling nearly 2.4 million copies on release day alone and making it, at the time, the fastest-selling PC game released at that point. Approximately 3.53 million copies were sold in the first month of release, including 1.9 million in North America, over 100,000 copies in Australasia, and nearly 1.6 million in Europe.\n\nTwo new playable races were added to \"World of Warcraft\" in \"The Burning Crusade\": the Draenei of the Alliance and the Blood Elves of the Horde. Previously, the shaman class was exclusive to the Horde faction (available to the orc, troll and tauren races), and the paladin class was exclusive to the Alliance faction (available to the human and dwarf races); with the new races, the expansion allowed players to be a Draenei shaman (Alliance), and a Blood Elf paladin (Horde). The level cap was raised by ten, making it 70 (up from 60, established in the original World of Warcraft) in addition to that; a whole new planet, Outland, was released, with associated quests, dungeons, raids, zones, creatures, and cities.\n\nIn Player versus Player (PvP), a new battleground, Eye of the Storm was introduced with two brackets: one for characters between levels 61–69, and another for level 70 characters. Players are unable to summon flying mounts in this battleground. The Eye of the Storm battleground is only available to those with the expansion.\n\nIn addition, a new PvP Arena System was introduced as a way for players to fight in 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3, or 5 vs 5 death-match style battles. While the arena system allowed players without \"The Burning Crusade\" expansion to partake in skirmish matches, those without the expansion were unable to participate in rated matches, which yield rewards based on a point system. Ladder matches were only accessible by players who have reached level 70. Three arena stages were introduced in The Burning Crusade expansion, including The Ruins of Lordaeron in the Undercity, The Circle of Blood in Blade's Edge Mountains, and the Ring of Trials in Nagrand.\nArena matches have taken a more prominent role in World of Warcraft's PvP content, and have developed into an electronic sport. One example of Arena matches as an electronic sport was the World Series of Video Games in 2007, where player teams competed in 3 vs 3 matches to earn cash prizes. Blizzard also holds its own seasonal tournament, the World of Warcraft Arena Tournament, which pitches teams from servers all around the world against each other. This tournament concludes with a 5v5 world final event, the first of which took place at BlizzCon ’07 and so ended season 1.\n\nAdditional \"outdoor\" PvP objectives were implemented, which are different for each zone in which they are located. Most of these outdoor PvP objectives involve \"capturing\" key points to reward players of the same faction in the area, usually with a temporary buff that adds a damage boost to player attacks or increases the rate players gain experience or faction points while the players are in the zone. For example, Terokkar Forest's PvP contest involves players standing near towers in order to capture them while defending the towers in PvP combat with players of the opposite faction that try to capture the objective. Other examples include Halaa in Nagrand and the Hellfire Fortifications in Hellfire Peninsula, where players compete for control to unlock quest and vendor access or gain factional reputation for rewards.\n\nThere are two new races in this expansion: the Blood Elves for the Horde and the Draenei for the Alliance.\n\nThe Blood Elves (Sin'dorei, meaning \"Children of the Blood\") are former High Elves that have been removed from the Alliance. In the Third War, the Undead Scourge invaded and destroyed their home of Quel'Thalas to destroy the Sunwell, the high elven source of magic. Without it, many high elves became frail and weak, and in their desperation, turned to fel (demonic) magic to sate their cravings. They then called themselves Blood Elves, in honor of their fallen kin. However, their addiction cost them their Human allies, and have instead joined the Horde in an effort to survive.\n\nBlood Elves can be played as hunters, warlocks, priests, paladins, rogues, and mages.\n\nThe Draenei (\"exiled ones\" in their native tongue), originally called the Eredar, have an extensive history, spanning several thousand years. 25,000 years ago, the dark Titan Sargeras approached the three Eredar leaders, Archimonde, Kil'jaeden, and Velen, promising them untold power in exchange for their loyalty. However, the prophet Velen foresaw the destruction that they would cause under Sargeras, and gathered those who believed him and fled their homeworld with the help of the Naaru. Kil'jaeden and Archimonde, however, succumbed to Sargeras' promise of infinite power. After flying from world to world, Velen and his refugees ended up in Draenor, or what is known today as Outland, where they had a tenuous pact with the native orcs. Eventually, the Orcs began to follow Kil'jaeden and started using shadow and fel magics. Kil'jaeden had persuaded the Orcs into the complete annihilation of the Draenei. The few that survived fled again on their ship, The Exodar, and crash landed on Azeroth, where they were welcomed into the Alliance for their devout faith in the light.\n\nThe Draenei can be played as warriors, paladins, priests, shamans, hunters, and mages.\n\nThe expansion's name refers to the return of the \"Burning Legion\"; a vast army of demons being one of the main, recurring antagonist forces in the Warcraft-universe and whose last invasion was defeated in \"\". This legion and its allies are the main enemy which players will fight against in \"The Burning Crusade\". In addition to some new areas on Azeroth, this expansion mainly features the ravaged world of Outland which the Burning Legion and other powerful beings control.\n\nThe Doom Lord Kazzak reopened the Dark Portal to Outland, flooding Azeroth with the ravenous demons of the Burning Legion. Expeditions from the Horde and Alliance, reinforced by their new blood elf and draenei allies, passed through the gateway to stop the invasion at its source. On Outland's desiccated Hellfire Peninsula, the Alliance discovered several of their heroes who had crossed through the portal many years before, while the Horde made contact with the Mag'har (uncorrupted) orcs who had not participated in their race's original invasion of Azeroth. The expedition into Outland dragged Horde and Alliance armies further into conflict with the agents of the Legion and the lieutenants of Illidan Stormrage, who had claimed the shattered realm for his own.\n\nIn his quest to reign over all of Outland, Illidan the Betrayer had established a mighty stronghold for his forces within the Black Temple, a former draenei citadel. Yet his influence began to wane after the defeat of his most trusted lieutenants, including the ruler of the Illidari Naga, Lady Vashj, and the traitorous former leader of the blood elves, Kael'thas Sunstrider. The resulting window of opportunity permitted Akama, an elder sage of devolved draenei known as the Broken, to rebel against the self-styled \"Lord of Outland.\" Along with Illidan's former jailor, the obsessed night elf Maiev Shadowsong, Akama helped a group of heroes infiltrate Illidan's seat of power and put an end to the Betrayer's reign once and for all.\n\nFollowing years of battles alongside the old Horde, the troll warlord Zul'jin retired to the city of Zul'Aman, capital of the Amani trolls, where he called upon mysterious dark powers to rebuild his army. While the eyes of Azeroth focused on the fight against the Burning Legion and the expedition to Outland, treasure-seekers invaded Zul'Aman, rekindling Zul'jin's hatred of the outside world—particularly the high elves of Quel'Thalas. Upon hearing that these newly christened \"blood elves\" had become part of the Horde in his absence, the infuriated Zul'jin declared war on both Horde and Alliance. To gain the upper hand, Zul'jin attempts to awaken ancient animal gods to harness their power, but is slain by a group of heroes before his plans can come to fruition.\n\nFresh from his defeat in Outland, Kael'thas Sunstrider returned to the blood elf city of Silvermoon. Rather than lead his people to glory as he had promised, the disgraced prince betrayed them. Kael'thas plotted to use the legendary Sunwell, source of the blood elves' magical power, to summon the demon lord Kil'jaeden into Azeroth. Aided by a joint task force of blood elves and draenei, the Shattered Sun Offensive, Horde and Alliance heroes, with the help of a dragon Kalecgos and the Sunwell's mortal form, Anveena; narrowly stopped both Kael'thas and Kil'jaeden, though Anveena sacrifices herself in the process. The draenei prophet Velen then uses the naaru M'uru's energy to reignite and purify the Sunwell.\n\nRelease was staggered by time zone, with players queuing outside more than 5000 brick and mortar game stores around the world as midnight approached in their local time zone. The game was released in North America, Europe, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia on January 16, 2007. It was released in Australasia one day later on January 17, 2007. It was later released in South Korea on February 1, 2007; in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau on April 30, 2007. The game was released in mainland China on September 6, 2007.\n\nOn June 28, 2011, Blizzard included the Burning Crusade expansion to all players who purchase the base game. On July 17, 2018 with the pre-patch to , Blizzard included all expansions except the latest to all players who subscribe.\n\nBlizzard made a number of errors during the distribution of \"World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade\" in Europe. One such error was the failure to register the Collector's Edition for in-game rewards. As such, players who purchased the Collector's Edition of the game would have to send numerous proofs of purchase to Blizzard by postal mail in order to redeem their in-game awards. To compensate for the additional trouble, as well as encouraging players to send in proof, Blizzard sent these players an exclusive in-game pet not found in other regions.\n\nOnly 1,600 copies were delivered to Romania, which had more than 10,000 \"World of Warcraft\" subscribers at the time.\n\nThe Collector's Edition of \"World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade\" included an audio CD of the soundtrack including 21 tracks of the orchestrally recorded music, composed by Russell Brower, Derek Duke, Matt Uelmen, and Neal Acree with additional music by Brian David Farr and David Arkenstone. The soundtrack was also subsequently released for purchase through online sources, such as Apple's iTunes Store.\n\n\"The Burning Crusade\" received almost universal praise from critics upon release.\n\nThe specially designed new starter areas met a mixed reception from critics. On the one hand, they were felt to give a strong new perspective to existing players or a solid introduction to the game to new players. The arrangement of quests and content in these areas was felt to be more finely tuned than for existing races, with players unlikely to face grinding in order to progress and an interesting backstory being gradually revealed. It was felt that Blizzard had learned from the release of the original game, with the new content being varied without becoming overwhelming to new players, and new concepts being gradually introduced. On the other hand, reviewers felt that the new starter areas were poorly integrated with the existing world, leaving them feeling \"tacked on.\" They were also disappointed that the new areas had a definite finish, beyond which a player would have to switch back to older content in order to progress their character. This progression didn't feel as smooth to reviewers when compared to the movement between zones for new characters from the older starting areas. The experience was also felt to be short-lived, with players being able to progress through these new areas with a couple of days' play without any new introductory dungeons to explore. It was also felt that these changes didn't address existing problems, such as the travel time between quest locations.\n\nLike in the original, the scenery of \"The Burning Crusade\" was highly praised, being described as \"occasionally breathtaking,\" The introductory video to the expansion was described as \"hugely impressive.\" It was generally felt that the new Outland areas were some of the best in the game, with the size of the new areas introduced being similar to the total size of other existing games in the genre. The new starting areas were also liked, with reviewers appreciating the attention to detail in these zones. Building architecture, scenery and creatures were all singled out for mention, despite some disappointment that buildings and creatures from the original game had been \"rubber stamped\" into these new locations. The uniqueness of each zone, from scorched plateaus to lush forests were praised, each area being described as having its own unique feel. The various small features, such as mechanical settlements or abandoned temples were also well liked. Players were advised that they would spend a large amount of time \"just staring at the scenery\" in these new locations. That said, it was felt that the game was starting to show its age, with careful use of texture and lighting techniques disguising a basic underlying geometry. This was thought to follow on from the strategy in the original game, where strong art direction and careful choice of color helped to compensate for a simpler game engine, describing it as a \"testament of art over technology.\"\n\nThe orchestral music was well received, being described as providing a \"constantly changing backdrop.\" The new score was felt to mesh well with the original, while still providing occasional \"fresh twists.\" The soundtracks to each of the two new starting areas were particularly praised. Reviewers were generally positive about the voice acting in the game.\n\"World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade\" was the best-selling PC game of 2007 in North America and Europe, and it is also the third fastest-selling PC game of all time (behind Wrath of The Lich King and Cataclysm), selling nearly 2.4 million copies in its first 24 hours and approximately 3.5 million in its first month. It received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

It is used to manage stormwater runoff to prevent flooding and downstream erosion, and improve water quality in an adjacent river, stream, lake or bay. \n\nIt is distinguished from a detention basin, sometimes called a \"dry pond\", which temporarily stores water after a storm, but eventually empties out at a controlled rate to a downstream water body. It also differs from an infiltration basin which is designed to direct stormwater to groundwater through permeable soils.\n\nWet ponds are frequently used for water quality improvement, groundwater recharge, flood protection, aesthetic improvement or any combination of these. Sometimes they act as a replacement for the natural absorption of a forest or other natural process that was lost when an area is developed. As such, these structures are designed to blend into neighborhoods and viewed as an amenity.\n\nIn urban areas, impervious surfaces (roofs, roads) reduce the time spent by rainfall before entering into the stormwater drainage system. If left unchecked, this will cause widespread flooding downstream. The function of a stormwater pond is to contain this surge and release it slowly. This slow release mitigates the size and intensity of storm-induced flooding on downstream receiving waters. Stormwater ponds also collect suspended sediments, which are often found in high concentrations in stormwater water due to upstream construction and sand applications to roadways.\n\nStorm water is typically channeled to a retention basin through a system of street and/or parking lot storm drains, and a network of drain channels or underground pipes. The basins are designed to allow relatively large flows of water to enter, but discharges to receiving waters are limited by outlet structures that function only during very large storm events.\n\nRetention ponds are often landscaped with a variety of grasses, shrubs and/or wetland plants to provide bank stability and aesthetic benefits. Vegetation also provides water quality benefits by removing soluble nutrients through uptake. In some areas the ponds can attract nuisance types of wildlife like ducks or Canada geese, particularly where there is minimal landscaping and grasses are mowed. This reduces the ability of foxes, coyotes and other predators to approach their prey unseen. Such predators tend to hide in the cattails and other tall, thick grass surrounding natural water features.\n\nProper depth of retention ponds is important for removal of pollutants and maintenance of fish populations. Urban fishing continues to be one of the fastest growing fishing segments as new suburban neighbourhoods are built around these aquatic areas.\n\nA retention basin can also be a part of a nuclear reactor used to contain a core meltdown.\n\n"}

He moved to Haarlem in 1620, where his son, the landscape painter Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem was born (October 1). He and Willem Claeszoon Heda, who also worked in Haarlem, were the most important exponents of the \"ontbijt\" or dinner piece. They painted with subdued, virtually monochromatic palettes, the subtle handling of light and texture being the prime means of expression. Claesz generally chose objects of a more homely kind than Heda, although his later work became more colourful and decorative. Claesz's still lifes often suggest allegorical purpose, with skulls serving as reminders of human mortality. The two men founded a distinguished tradition of still life painting in Haarlem. Pieter Claesz was influenced by the artist movement 'Vanitas'.\n\nClaesz is registered in the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke as the teacher of his son, Nicolaes Berchem, in 1634, but Nicolaes preferred landscapes to still life painting and later after a trip his talent in music. Claesz had, in addition to his son, the pupils Evert van Aelst, Floris van Dyck, Christian Berentz, Floris van Schooten, and Jan Jansz Treck.\nThere are few samples of this artist in Spanish collections.

Also known as The Pearl of the Ionian Sea, it is located within a small bay on the Ionian Sea; it was a private property owned by Florence Trevelyan until 1990, when it was bought by the Region of Sicily, being turned into a nature reserve, administrated by the Italian branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature. There is a narrow path that often connects the island to the mainland beach. The island is surrounded by sea grottos and has a small and rather rocky beach which is a popular destination for sunbathers.\n\nKing Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies gifted the island to the nearby town of Taormina in 1806. The island was in 1890 bought from the town by Trevelyan, who built a small house facing the sea and imported exotic plants, which thrived in the Mediterranean climate. Subsequent owners kept up the island, until the owner went bankrupt, and auctioned the island in 1990. The island had been noted by conservationists as early as 1983, and it was quickly obtained by the region and designated as a protected natural site. The island is home to several species of birds, and a few types of lizards.\n"}

She appeared in many American film, stage, and television productions, including \"Lost Horizon\" (1937), \"The Leopard Man\" (1943), \"Viva Zapata!\" (1952), and \"I'll Cry Tomorrow\" (1955). She married actor Eddie Albert in 1945 and was later known as Margo Albert.\n\nMargo was born into a musically talented family in Mexico City in 1917. As a child, she trained as a dancer with Eduardo Cansino, the father of Rita Hayworth. At the age of nine, she began dancing professionally with her uncle Xavier Cugat and his band in performances at Mexican nightclubs. Margo travelled to the United States as a child, living in New York City with her aunt, singer Carmen Castillo. While accompanying her uncle's band during a performance at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City, Margo was noticed by producer and director Ben Hecht and screenwriter Charles MacArthur, who cast the 15-year-old performer as the lead in their film \"Crime Without Passion\". Margo also played the character of Miriamne Esdras both on stage and in the 1936 film version of \"Winterset\", which one critic called a \"cinemagoer's must.\" Other notable roles in the 1930s include parts in the 1937 film \"Lost Horizon\" and Broadway productions of Maxwell Anderson's \"Masque of Kings\" (1937) and Sidney Kingsley's \"The World We Make\" (1939).\n\nWhile Margo continued to act in films until the 1960s, her career was curtailed by the television blacklist that began in 1950, with the targeting of Gypsy Rose Lee, Jean Muir, Hazel Scott, and Ireene Wicker. Margo was known for her progressive political views, but she was not a member of the Communist Party. In 1950, her name and that of her husband were published in \"Red Channels\", an anti-Communist pamphlet that purported to expose Communist influence within the entertainment industry. \"Red Channels\" labeled her a communist because of her support for the Hollywood Ten, her advocacy for peace, and her support for refugees.\n\nAlbert's son spoke of his parents' blacklisting in an interview published in December 1972, crediting Albert's service during World War II with ultimately saving his career.\n\nEddie Albert's film career survived the blacklist, but Margo was blacklisted by the major Hollywood studios.\n\nIn the years after the blacklist, Margo pursued her advocacy for arts and education. In 1970, along with Frank Lopez, a trade union activist, Margo founded Plaza de la Raza (Place of the People) in East Los Angeles. A cultural center for arts and education, Plaza de la Raza remains in operation today, providing year-round programming in arts education. Her work with Plaza de la Raza included serving as the artistic director and as chairperson of the board. Albert's commitment to the arts extended beyond her work in East Los Angeles: she served as a steering committee member on the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities and was a member of the board of the National Council of the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nMargo was married twice. In 1937 she wed actor Francis Lederer, but they divorced in 1940. In December 1945, three years after she became a naturalized citizen of the United States, she married actor Eddie Albert. She and Albert had two children, a son (actor Edward Albert) and a daughter (Maria Carmen Zucht, who served as her father's business manager). The couple remained together for 40 years, until 1985, when she died from brain cancer at age 68 in their home in Pacific Palisades, California. Her gravesite is in Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles.\n\n\nThis filmography of theatrical features is believed to be complete.\n\n\n"}

He was the nephew of the early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and cousin to Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, the author of \"Frankenstein\".\n\nIn 1812, while travelling from Lisbon to Cadiz, he met Alexander Berry, with whom he later formed a trading partnership, intending to operate in the colony of New South Wales. He shared lodgings with his sister Elizabeth and Berry in London from 1815 to 1819; the couple eventually married.\n\nWollstonecraft arrived in Sydney on board the ship \"Grenada\" on 31 August 1819. He received a land grant from Governor Lachlan Macquarie for 2,000 acres (8 km²), 500 acres (2 km²) of which were located on the north shore of Port Jackson running from what is now to the foreshore. A warehouse was erected in George Street, Sydney, under the name of \"Berry and Wollstonecraft\".\n\nIn 1822, Wollstonecraft and Berry were granted 10,000 acres (40 km²) of land on the Shoalhaven River (now the site of Coolangatta Estate) on the condition that they took responsibility for a hundred convicts. They built Australia's first canal there, with the assistance of Hamilton Hume and a party of convicts. The 209 yard long canal was completed in 12 days. The crops farmed at Shoalhaven included native cedar and tobacco, which were sold at considerable profit both to the growing colony at Sydney and for export. The property at Shoalhaven grew to 40,000 acres (162 km²) under Berry's management, while Wollstonecraft looked after business in Sydney.\n\nEdward Wollstonecraft was active in local affairs, and involved in a number of societies and organisations in the colony. These included the Philosophical Society of Australasia (now the Royal Society of New South Wales), of which he was a founding member, and the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales, serving as steward and secretary during the 1820s. In 1822, he was appointed senior director of the Bank of New South Wales and chairman of the first chamber of commerce. He was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1824.\n\nEdward Wollstonecraft suffered ill health and died on 7 December 1832, aged 49. He was buried in the Sydney Burial Ground in Elizabeth Street. When his sister Elizabeth, Berry's wife, died, Berry constructed a tomb near St Thomas' Anglican Church, North Sydney, and Edward's remains were moved there. The tomb is still standing, and the graveyard of the church is now St Thomas' Rest Park.\n\nThe suburb of Wollstonecraft is named after him. He built a cottage on the north shore of Sydney Harbour in 1820 which he called \"Crows Nest\". This later became the name of a larger house and estate on the same site. The suburb of Crows Nest is named after the house and estate.\n\n"}

He shares credit for what is often referred to as the Segal–Shale–Weil representation. Early in his career Segal became known for his developments in quantum field theory and in functional and harmonic analysis, in particular his innovation of the algebraic axioms known as C*-algebra.\n\nIrving Ezra Segal was born in the Bronx on September 13, 1918, to Jewish parents. He attended school in Trenton. In 1934 he was admitted to Princeton University, at the age of 16. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, completed his undergraduate studies in just three years time, graduated with highest honors with a bachelor's degree in 1937, and was awarded the George B. Covington Prize in Mathematics. He was then admitted to Yale, and in another three years time had completed his doctorate, receiving his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1940. Segal taught at Harvard University, then he joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton on a Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, working from 1941 to 1943 with Albert Einstein and John von Neumann. During World War II Segal served in the US Army conducting research in ballistics at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. He joined the mathematics department at the University of Chicago in 1948 where he served until 1960. In 1960 he joined the mathematics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he remained as a professor until his death in 1998. He won three Guggenheim Fellowships, in 1947, 1951 and 1967, and received the Humboldt Award in 1981. He was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1966 in Moscow and in 1970 in Nice. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1973.\n\nIn 1983 Victor Guillemin edited a festschrift dedicated to Irving Segal. \"Physics Today\" published a review of \"Introduction to Algebraic and Constructive Quantum Field Theory\" (1992), which Segal coauthored.\n\nSegal died in Lexington, Massachusetts, on August 30, 1998. Edward Nelson's obituary article about Segal concludes: \"... It is rare for a mathematician to produce a life work that at the time can be fully and confidently evaluated by no one, but the full impact of the work of Irving Ezra Segal will become known only to future generations.\"\n\nSegal provided an alternative to the Big Bang theory of expansion of the universe. The cosmological redshift that motivates the expanding universe theory is due to curvature of the cosmos, according to Segal. He portrayed the spatial part of the cosmos as a large 3-sphere. Spacetime cannot turn back on itself. At each point in the cosmos there is a convex future direction, meaning, \"the future can never merge into the past\", no spacetime curvature can close or loop. Building on common symmetry expressed by the Lorentz group, Poincare group, and conformal group of spacetime, Segal saw the closing up of the universe as consistent with compactification of spacetime used to define the conformal group. Segal reviewed redshift data to verify his cosmology. He claimed confirmation, but generally his chronometric cosmology has not found favor.\nFor instance, Abraham H. Taub reviewed \"Mathematical Cosmology and Extragalactic Astronomy\", saying \nAs for the cosmic microwave background, in the chronometric view, \"The observed blackbody... is simply the most likely disposition of remnants of light on a purely random basis... and is not at all uniquely indicative of a Big Bang.\"\n\nIn 2005 A. Daigneault spoke on \"Irving Segal's Axiomitization of Spacetime and it Cosmological Consequences\" in Budapest.\nHe concedes at the outset that Segal's cosmology is \"generally ignored by astrophysicists\", and that the model was first proposed by Einstein in 1917 and is \"supposedly discredited\".\n\nFor a list of 227 articles and 10 books to which Segal contributed, see the MIT external link below.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is owned and operated by Orange County. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a \"general aviation\" facility.\n\nIt is a popular place for aspiring local pilots to learn to fly or practice their skills. With 125,000 takeoffs and landings annually, it was New York's second-busiest general-aviation airport in 2006.\n\nTransmissions between pilots and the airport are rebroadcast on a one-watt station at 88.1 megahertz, so it is possible to tune into them on a standard car radio while driving in the vicinity.\n\nThe airport's low traffic and out-of-the-way location have made it a popular place to store private jets. In 2006 county officials were reported to be working on a deal with a local developer to build 10 private luxury hangars to cater to what they saw as a growing market and raise money for the airport without raising taxes.\n\nOrange County Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 3/21 is and 8/26 is .\n\nThere are three corporate facilities at KMGJ. Take Flight Aviation, voted as 2018's Best Flight School in the United States by AOPA, offers flight training and aircraft management as well as aircraft acquisition and consultation. Avquest Aviation Services also offers flight training and aircraft management in addition to aircraft maintenance and sales. Taylor Aviation, Inc. offers charter services, aircraft sales and brokerage, maintenance and storage as well as management and consulting. Mid Hudson Aviation, LLC offers aircraft maintenance as well as management and consulting. \n\nFor the 12-month period ending August 5, 2010, the airport had 120,000 aircraft operations, an average of 328 per day: 97% general aviation, 2% air taxi, and 1% military. At that time there were 140 aircraft based at this airport: 88% single-engine, 9% multi-engine, and 3% jet.\n\nIn 2017 it was reported that the airport had had 100,000 takeoffs and landings the year before, 80% of which had been recreational with the remainder business-related. The airport currently has 130 hangars and has a total of 166 based aircraft. Two pilots keep Czech-made fighter jets at the airport.\n\nThe airport was built as an Army training field in 1942. It was turned over to the county 20 years later.\n\nOn July 17, 1960, NASCAR came to the airport with the Empire State 200, on a two-mile (3.2 km) course. Rex White held off Richard Petty for the win, in front of about 5,000 fans; the mediocre attendance killed any chance of making the race an annual event, as was planned. It remains the only NASCAR event ever held in the Hudson Valley.\n\nIn 2016 the airport began a three-year project to move one of the runways a thousand feet (300 m) to the north and change its angle by 8 degrees in order to provide a buffer zone at the ends required by the FAA for emergency landings (previously, the runway had ended at the Wallkill River). along with a new taxiway adjacent to it. The project is mostly being paid for by the FAA; the state and county have contributed 10% of the $33 million cost. Since a pond had to be filled in for the project, it was necessary under state law to create a replacement wetland, which cost $1 million.\n\n"}

The following year he began illustrating comics, written by Frank Ashley, for Frank Johnson Publications. These included \"Larry Flynn, Detective\". Pitt had no art training and no opportunity to associate with other Johnson artists, like Unk White, Carl Lyon and Jim Russell.\n\nIn 1945 he produced comic strip advertisements for Colgate Palmolive, which led to Associated Newspapers placing him under contract to develop a new science fiction strip, \"Silver Starr\" (or \"Silver Starr in the Flameworld\"). \"Silver Starr\" debuted in the Sydney newspapers \"The Guardian\" and \"Sunday Sun\" on 24 November 1946. The strips ran until November 1948, where following a dispute regarding the print size of the strip Pitt left the paper. \"Silver Starr\" was a Flash Gordon-style comic strip centred on an Australian soldier, Silver, who on his return from the Second World War, joins an expedition, with his companions, Dr. Onro and Dyson, to the Earth's interior aboard a rocket-style ship. Together, they discover the incredible \"Flame World\" and its ruler, Queen Pristine (Pitt's compliment to Raymond's Dale Arden), rescuing her from the evil despot, Tarka (another acknowledgement to Raymond's character Ming the Merciless). John Ryan, in his Australian comic anthology \"Panel by Panel\", describes the strip as having story lines of average standard for this type of comic with the real attraction being the artwork.\n\nIn 1948 Pitt produced \"Jim Atlas\" and \"Dr Peril of Igogo\" as back-up stories for the early issues of \"Captain Atom\", a superhero comic by Arthur Mather published by Atlas Publications.\n\nPitt was then employed by John Fairfax and Sons for their new paper, \"The Sun-Herald\", where he produced a new science fiction comic strip, \"Captain Power\", with the storyline provided by journalist Gerry Brown, the first issue appearing on 6 March 1949. \"Captain Power\" relied heavily on super-hero style costumes and gadgets for its impact. He continued to illustrate the strip until June 1950, when the pressure of other work saw him pass the strip onto Peter James. At the time Pitt commenced illustrating \"Yarmak-Jungle King\" comics, for Young's Merchandising, in November 1949, which he continued until June 1952. \"Yarmak\" was a \"Tarzan\" imitation, with the comic illustrated by Pitt and inked at various stages by Frank and Jimmy Ashley and Paul Wheelahan, with the stories written by Frank Ashley or Pitt's younger brother, Reginald. The quality of the comic varied from issue to issue given the number of people involved in its production. Together with his brother, Reginald, he attempted to get two strips, \"Lemmy Caution\" and \"Mr Midnight\", syndicated in the United States, when this failed he joined Cleveland Press in 1956, where he created a new series of \"Silver Starr\". During his time at Cleveland Press, Pitt produced over 3,000 pulp fiction covers. The two brothers then commenced work on a new comic, \"Gully Foyle\". \"Gully Foyle\" was conceived by Reginald, based on Alfred Bester's novel \"The Stars My Destination\". According to writer Kevin Patrick, Stan and Reginald's process involved producing black and white bromide photo prints that Stan then coloured by hand; these were then forwarded to Bester in the United States for approval. According to Patrick, the brothers completed several months of the comic strip for potential syndication but then faced a legal objection from the producers of a proposed film version of \"The Stars My Destination\", who held exclusive adaptation rights to the book. Unable to sell \"Gully Foyle\", the brothers stopped work on the project, with only a few pieces of their artwork eventually making it into the public domain, through a number of fan magazines. As a result of his artwork on the unpublished \"Gully Foyle\", Pitt was approached by two US publishers to handle comic book work for them. Pitt then became the first Australian artist to have original material published in an American comic book, with the publication of \"The Witching Hour\" No. 14 (National Periodical Publications, Inc) and \"Boris Karloff – Tales of Mystery\" No. 33 (Western Publishing).\n\nIn 1969 the US cartoonist, Al Williamson, arranged for Pitt to ghost an eleven-week sequence of his daily strip, \"Secret Agent Corrigan\", which was followed by a further four weeks in 1972. Pitt also provided poster illustrations for his childhood hero, \"Flash Gordon\".\n\nIn 2001 a limited edition of \"Gully Foyle\" was finally published and released. Pitt died on 2 April 2002, at the age of 77.\n\nIn 2019, Stan and Reg Pitt were awarded the Ledger of Honour at the annual Ledger Awards \n\n\n"}

Thanu Pillai (15 July 188527 July 1970) was a participant in the Indian independence movement who later served as the Chief Minister of Kerala from 22 February 1960 to 25 September 1962. He was known as the 'Bhishmacharya' of Kerala politics.\n\nBorn in Thiruvananthapuram, A.Thanu Pillai was the son of Varadayyan and Eswari Amma. Thanu Pillai completed his studies and earned a degree in law. He had practised as a lawyer as well. But soon he got attracted towards Indian Freedom Struggle movement and abandoned his career in favour of involvement in the struggle and joined the Indian National Congress. He became the leader of Indian National Congress in the erstwhile princely state of Travancore.\n\nPattom Thanu Pillai remained as one of the leaders of Indian National Congress during the period when Kingdom of Tranvancore became an Independent state and later merged with Cochin to form Travancore-Cochin. On 3 June 1947, United Kingdom accepted demands for a partition and announced its intention to quit India within a short period. The Maharaja of Travancore desired to declare himself independent. Supported by the then Diwan, C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, Chithira Thirunal issued a declaration of independence on 18 June 1947. As Travancore's declaration of independence was unacceptable to India, negotiations were started with the Diwan by the Government of India. Family sources indicate that C. P., himself, was not in favour of independence but only greater autonomy and that a favourable agreement had been reached between C. P. and the Indian representatives by 23 July 1947 and accession to the Indian Union could not be carried out only because it was pending approval by the Raja. Nevertheless, an assassination attempt was made on C. P. on 25 July 1947 during a concert commemorating the anniversary of Swati Thirunal. C. P. survived with multiple stab wounds and hastened the accession of Travancore state to the Indian Union soon after his recovery.\n\nAfter the accession of Travancore state to the Indian Union, P. G. N. Unnithan took over as the last Diwan of independent Travancore on 20 August 1947 following C. P. Ramaswami Iyer resigning as Diwan (subsequent to the attempt on Sir CP's life at the \"Swathi Thirunal Music academy\" on 25 July 1947). P. G. N. Unnithan chaired the Travancore Constitutional Reforms Committee. He relinquished office on 24 March 1948 when a people's government led by Sri Pattom Thanu Pillai as Prime Minister took over. Pattom Thanu Pilla was the first Prime Minister of Independent Travancore state. He resigned as Prime Minister of Tranvacore on 17 October 1948. He was succeeded by Parur T. K. Narayana Pillai as the second and last Prime Minister of Travancore. After India's independence in 1947, Travancore and Cochin were merged to form Travancore-Cochin on 1 July 1949. It was originally called United State of Travancore and Cochin with Trivandrum as the capital. It was renamed State of Travancore-Cochin in January 1950 and was recognised as a state. During merger of Travancore and Cochin E. Ikkanda Warrier was the Prime Minister of the state of Cochin. Warrier resigned as the last Prime Minister of the state of Cochin on 30 June 1949 helping the merger of the two states. Parur T. K. Narayana Pillai was unanimously elected the leader of the Congress Legislature Party and he assumed charge as the first Chief Minister of Travancore-Cochin from 1 July 1949.\n\nFirst Ministry of the state of Travancore-Cochin headed by Parur T. K. Narayana Pillai resigned on 24 February 1951 following a corruption charge on the ministry. He was succeeded by C. Kesavan as the second Chief Minister of Travancore-Cochin. The first assembly of the state of Travancore-Cochin was dissolved on 12 March 1952 following the resignation of C Kesavan. Following the elections to the Legislative Assembly, held on 27 March 1952, A. J. John became the third Chief Minister of Travancore-Cochin. The second assembly of Travancore-Cochin lasted till 16 March 1954. By that time Pattom Thanu Pillai left Indian National Congress and joined Praja Socialist Party (PSP). In the election for the third Legislative Assembly of Travancore-Cochin held in 1954, Praja Socialist Party won 19 seats out of the contested 38 seats. Praja Socialist Party formed a coalition government along with the Indian National Congress who had won 45 seats. Pattom Thanu Pillai became the fourth Chief Minister of Travancore-Cochin with the support of Indian National Congress on 16 March 1954. He resigned on 10 February 1955 and was succeeded by Panampilly Govinda Menon as the last Chief Minister of Travancore-Cochin. He remained in office till 23 March 1956. After that the state remained under President's rule till 5 April 1957. During this time state of Kerala was formed. Under State Reorganisation Act of 1956, the four southern taluks of Travancore, namely Thovalai, Agasteeswaram, Kalkulam and Vilavancode and a part of the Chencotta Taluk was merged with Madras State. On 1 November 1956 Travancore-Cochin was joined with Malabar District of Madras State, the taluk of Kasaragod and South Kanara to form the new state of Kerala.\n\nAfter the first ever elections to the Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957, the Communist Party of India emerged as the single largest party. E M S Namboodiripad formed the first elected government with the support of 5 independent legislators. The government was not able to complete its full 5 years term. The Communist-led government collapsed as a consequence of the movement known as the \"Vimochana Samaram\" (Liberation Struggle). The Communist government was dismissed on 31 July 1959 and President's rule was imposed in the state, under Article 356 of the constitution. Fresh Elections were held in 1960 and Pattom A. Thanu Pillai became the second Chief Minister of Kerala, as head of a PSP-Congress coalition administration. He assumed office on 22 February 1960. However, he resigned as chief minister of Kerala on 26 September 1962 to make way for R. Sankar of the Indian National Congress as the next Chief Minister of the state. He was appointed as Governor of Punjab on 1 October 1962 by the Central Government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru. Later he became Governor of Andhra Pradesh on 4 May 1964 and remained in office till 11 April 1968.\n\nTwo years after resigning as Governor of Andhra Pradesh Pattom Thanu Pillai died on 27 July 1970.\n"}
{"id": "2255500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255500", "title": "Lone Star Series", "text": "Lone Star Series\n\nThe Lone Star Series (also known as the Silver Boot Series) is a Major League Baseball (MLB) rivalry featuring Texas' two major league franchises, the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers. It is an outgrowth of the \"natural rivalry\" established by MLB as part of interleague play as the Rangers are a member of the American League (AL) and the Astros were a member of the National League (NL) until . During interleague play, the winner of the six game series was awarded the Silver Boot, a tall display of a size 15 cowboy boot cast in silver, complete with a custom, handmade spur. If the series was split (3 to 3), the winner was the club which scored the most runs over the course of the series. In , the Astros joined the American League West with the Rangers and changed their rivalry from an interleague to an intra-division rivalry.\n\nThe Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex (DFW) and Greater Houston areas have been rivals in sports and other areas for many years. Differences, not related to baseball, include the weather during the summer, population, cultural, and allegiance preferences between the different regions of Texas. Both Greater Houston and DFW have humid subtropical climates; however, DFW mostly has dry winds in the summer and sometimes icy conditions in the winter, with some frost at night, compared to Greater Houston's severe relative humidity and minimal wind, except near the coast, and milder winter conditions. The Metroplex is located inland in North Texas while Houston is in the face of the Gulf of Mexico in Southeast Texas. The city of Dallas has the 9th largest population in the United States and 3rd largest population in Texas; the city of Houston has the 4th largest population in the United States and largest population in Texas. DFW is the 4th largest metropolitan area in the US, while the Greater Houston area is the 5th largest in the US.\n\nThere is also contrast between the Rangers and Astros in their ballpark and uniform histories. The Rangers, until 2020, played in open-air stadiums (Arlington Stadium and Rangers Ballpark in Arlington), while the Astros have mostly played in indoor stadiums (Astrodome and Minute Maid Park). While the Rangers have traditionally worn variations of red, white, and blue to represent the Lone Star flag, the Astros have changed color schemes (e.g. Shooting Star of the late 1960s, Rainbow Guts) and logos many times throughout their history.\n\nThe Lone Star Series was the consequence of many things that happened to Texas in the 1950s: population shift westward from metropolitan areas on the East Coast, the space program, more modernized higher education, and the formation of the brief Continental League resulting in expansion in Major League Baseball shortly thereafter.\n\nPrior to 1962, there were no Major League Baseball teams in Texas until the of the National League. They played in Colt Stadium for the first three years of existence, fighting against hot and humid weather and outrageously large mosquitoes, which also had an effect on the fans. Unbelievably, they did not play a Sunday night baseball game at home until June 9, 1963, which was also the major leagues' first Sunday night game. The Astros, as they came to be with the new all-weathered Harris County Domed Stadium, really did not have a strong rivalry with any team in the NL, except for the St. Louis Cardinals and later on the Cincinnati Reds and Atlanta Braves.\n\nDuring the planning of the second wave of expansion in the big leagues in 1968, the National League considered putting a new team in the Dallas-Fort Worth area by an overwhelming majority of its owners. However, Judge Roy Hofheinz did not want it to happen or allow it because he owned all the television and radio rights in Texas for Astros ballgames. The other owners were in favor, except Hofheinz, of having a rivalry approaching the intensity of the Dodgers–Giants rivalry in the Senior Circuit. San Diego and Montreal were selected instead. The Dallas-Fort Worth area would have to wait four more years for a team to arrive when the Senators (see below) moved to Arlington, Texas. It would be another 32 years before there was a meeting between the Rangers and Astros.\n\nBefore they were the Texas Rangers, the team belonged to the Beltway as the second version of the Washington Senators where they played mediocre baseball most of the time for the first 11 years of existence. They replaced the old Washington Senators who had moved to the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area to become the Minnesota Twins in 1961. The new Senators changed into the Texas Rangers in time for the 1972 season, and so a rivalry was born. (At one time, the Kansas City Athletics were interested in moving to the Dallas/Fort Worth area in the early 1960s but were voted down, 9–1, by the other American League owners.) The Astros have been in Texas ten years longer than the Rangers, but the Senators/Rangers franchise is one year older than the Astros. They met, starting in 1992, at the end of spring training with the Rangers winning 2–0 and claiming the very first Silver Boot. On April 1, 1993, Nolan Ryan returned to the Astrodome as a member of the Texas Rangers in front of 53,657, the biggest crowd to see a big league game in Texas up to that point. The Rangers won the last two exhibition games, a 6–5 victory in Arlington in 1999 and a 9–3 victory at Houston in 2000, before the two teams met for the first time in regular season in 2001.\n\nOne year before their first official matchup in interleague play, both teams retired the number of Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan, who had successful runs with both teams. During the 1997 off-season, \"radical\" realignment plans were bandied around about possibly rearranging teams from one league to another, especially Houston and Texas. In order to cut down on traveling costs and align teams together based on geography, the MLB owners came up with many plans to put the Astros and Rangers in a more suitable placement together. However, the American League and National League would lose their respective identities in the process. (The only move was the Brewers from the AL Central to the NL Central.) One of the plans in 2000 even featured the Texas Rangers in a six-team AL Central, so that they would be with other teams in the Central Time Zone, while the fledgling Arizona Diamondbacks would have had to leave the NL West for the AL West to replace the Rangers. During the 2005–06 off-season, the Florida Marlins were considering moving to San Antonio, among other cities, due to the lack of funding for a new stadium. Another professional baseball team in Texas, whether by relocation or expansion, in either league would create greater rivalries, similar to the kind in the NBA with the Spurs, Mavericks, and Rockets, and possible realignment issues.\n\nThe Lone Star Series was not conceived until , four years after interleague play began. It was only logical to have the Rangers and Astros matched together since they are the only MLB teams representing Texas. Since both played in two different divisions (AL West and NL Central, respectively), Major League Baseball had to rectify the oversight even though interleague play would not be rotated from division to division on a yearly basis until 2002.\n\nThere has only been one rainout in the history of the Lone Star Series. A game scheduled for Sunday June 30, 2002, at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington was postponed due to rain and rescheduled for Monday, September 2. The Rangers won the last game of the year against the Astros, 7–2, in front of a crowd of 24,468, but the Astros won the Silver Boot regardless of the outcome of the game.\n\nOn July 1, , Rangers outfielder Gary Matthews Jr. stole a home run from Astro Mike Lamb (a former Ranger) in what was considered one of the greatest catches of the decade according to MLB Network. At that time according to Lamb and Mark Teixeira, the Rangers-Astros \"rivalry\" was more for the fans in Texas than like a bitter rivalry (e.g. Windy City Series).\n\nBeginning in 2008, the Lone Star Series saw for the first time two African-American managers go head-to-head against one another, the Astros' Cecil Cooper and the Rangers' Ron Washington. This situation lasted for two years. On February 6, 2008, Nolan Ryan became the Rangers' team president after being the special assistant to general manager, scouting players, and holding pitching camps with the Astros for the previous three seasons.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, the Rangers acquired Iván Rodríguez in a trade from the Houston Astros to help them down the stretch for the purpose of achieving their first playoff appearance in ten years. It was Rodriguez's second stint with Texas. The team had a winning season but did not qualify for the postseason.\n\nOn September 14, 2010, the Astros' Triple-A affiliate, the Round Rock Express, announced that they would become the Rangers' new minor league affiliate. This change left the Astros without a Triple-A team and the Rangers' old Triple-A team, the Oklahoma City RedHawks, without a parent club. On September 20, 2010, the Astros made the RedHawks their own affiliate. These changes went into effect for the 2011 season.\n\nMajor League Baseball approved the sale of the Astros on November 11, , to Jim Crane on the condition they join the American League West. The Rangers, located in the Central Time Zone, had many of their games start late in the Pacific Time Zone due to the Angels, Athletics, and Mariners all being located on the West Coast. To help ease the Rangers' schedule, Commissioner Bud Selig required that the Astros join the AL West in , so both teams would have another division rival in relatively close geographical proximity to one another while ensuring that both the AL West and the National League Central both would have the same number of teams as the other divisions. The move's consequence for the rest of the league resulted in all teams having to play interleague games year round due to the odd number of teams in each league. Another consequence would be an increase in intensity of the Lone Star baseball rivalry.\n\nThe Astros and Rangers played each other on Opening Day on March 31, 2013, with the Astros winning convincingly at home. The next game, Rangers pitcher Yu Darvish was one out away from a perfect game when Marwin González hit a single through Darvish's legs.\n\nOn February 11, 2014, Nolan Ryan returned to the Astros as an executive advisor to his son, Reid, the president of business operations; general manager Jeff Luhnow; and owner Jim Crane. Nolan Ryan is also the only person to be named DHL Hometown Hero by two organizations (the Rangers and the Astros).\n\nIn April 2015, a brawl started between Rougned Odor and Hank Conger; the brawl escalated when Astros manager A. J. Hinch shoved Prince Fielder, which was followed by Rangers manager Jeff Bannister yelling in Hinch's face, \"Don't touch my guy!\" In September 2015, with both teams in contention for the playoffs, the Astros and Rangers faced each other in a pivotal series, with Texas sweeping all four games. The Rangers, who entered the series 1.5 games behind Houston for the AL West lead, ended the series leading the Astros by 2.5 games. The Rangers would go on to clinch the 2015 AL West Division title, while the Astros entered the 2015 playoffs as a Wild Card team. The Rangers marked the AL West division title by taunting the Astros with a parody of the Astros' \"Come And Take It!\" campaign by proclaiming \"We Came And Took It!\" during a game at Globe Life Park.\nIn 2017, the rivalry between the Astros and Rangers continued to heat up. During a radio interview Rangers manager Jeff Bannister was quoted as saying, \"All I know is they get to put Houston on their chest. We get to put Texas on ours.\" Astros pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. would fire back on Twitter stating, “It’s because nobody knows what Arlington is.\" Later in the 2017 season after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, controversy arose when the Astros and Rangers could not negotiate swapping series forcing the Astros to play a series of home games against the Rangers at the Tampa Bay Rays' stadium (Tropicana Field) in Florida. The Rangers would go on to win the series 2–1 but lose the season series 7–12. The Astros would go on to sweep the Rangers in the final three games of the series and outscore the Rangers 42–8 in the final four games. The Rangers did not make the 2017 playoffs, and the Astros would go on to clinch their first World Series championship, the first World Series Championship in the Astros-Rangers rivalry and the first World Series title for the State of Texas.\n\nHouston was victorious in both the 2018 and 2019 Silver Boot Series as they won the AL West both seasons, making it three consecutive division titles for the club. Meanwhile, Texas continued to rebuild and had losing seasons for the second and third year in a row.\n\nA total of 77 players have played for both franchises. But out of those 77, only 3 have played their entire careers for both teams: Chuck Jackson, Mike Richardt, and Mike Simms. Only six players have played for both the Rangers and Astros against their in-state opponent since 2001. Those players are: Doug Brocail, Mike Lamb, Richard Hidalgo, Ivan \"Pudge\" Rodríguez, Hunter Pence, and Robinson Chirinos.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2255511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255511", "title": "Ralph Branca", "text": "Ralph Branca\n\nRalph Theodore Joseph Branca (January 6, 1926 – November 23, 2016) was an American professional baseball pitcher who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from 1944 through 1956. Branca played for the Brooklyn Dodgers (1944–1953, 1956), Detroit Tigers (1953–1954), and New York Yankees (1954). He was a three-time All-Star. In a 1951 playoff, Branca surrendered a walk-off home run to Bobby Thomson of the New York Giants; the game-winning hit was known as the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\".\n\nRalph Branca was born in Mount Vernon, New York, as the fifteenth of seventeen children. His father, John Branca, was a trolley car conductor from Italy. His mother, Kati (née Berger), who was Jewish, immigrated to the United States in 1901 from Sandorf, Hungary (now Prievaly, Slovakia). His uncle Jozsef Berger was killed at the Majdanek concentration camp, and his maternal aunt Irma died at the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942. Ralph was raised Roman Catholic.\n\nBranca graduated from A. B. Davis High School and attended New York University (NYU) for one year, before he entered the big leagues. He played college baseball and college basketball for the NYU Violets.\n\nBranca was exempted from military service during World War II, due to his asthma and a punctured eardrum. After Branca attended a tryout with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1943, the team signed him to a contract. He debuted in the major leagues at age 18 on June 12, 1944, and put up a 3.04 earned run average (ERA) in 109 innings pitched in his rookie year.\n\nOn Opening Day in 1947—which was also Jackie Robinson's major league debut—Branca lined up on the field beside Robinson, while other players refused. That year, he had a 21–12 win–loss record and a 2.67 earned run average (ERA) in 280 innings pitched. He earned his first All-Star appearance and helped the Dodgers win the National League pennant. He was second in the league in wins, innings pitched, and strikeouts (148), third in ERA, and sixth in won-lost percentage (.636). Branca was also the starting pitcher in Game 1 of the 1947 World Series.\n\nA three-time All-Star, Branca won 80 games for the Dodgers with a career-high 21 wins in 1947. In 1948, he was ninth in the league in wins (14) and won–lost percentage (.609). In 1949, he led the National League (NL) in won-lost percentage (.722). In 1951, he was tenth in the NL in ERA (3.26).\n\nIn the final game of the best-of-three 1951 National League tie-breaker series at the Polo Grounds against the crosstown rival New York Giants, Branca entered the game in relief of Don Newcombe in the bottom of the ninth inning with one out and Whitey Lockman on second base and pinch runner Clint Hartung on third base and surrendered a walk-off home run, which became known as the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" to Bobby Thomson, giving the Giants the pennant. Prior to facing Thomson, Branca had been warming up in the bullpen with Carl Erskine. Dodgers coach Clyde Sukeforth noticed that Erskine was bouncing several curveballs in the dirt and instructed manager Charlie Dressen to call on Branca—this despite Thomson having homered off Branca in Game 1.\n\nThe pursuit of the homerun ball in the stands and afterward is a major thematic element of Don DeLillo's novel \"Underworld.\"\n\nA back injury suffered during spring training in 1952 limited Branca's effectiveness thereafter. Branca appeared in only 12 games for the Dodgers during the 1952 season. In the eighth inning of Game 7 of the 1952 World Series against the New York Yankees, Branca was ejected from the dugout by home plate umpire Larry Goetz for bench jockeying. Branca was only the second player in MLB history to be ejected from a World Series, and the first who was not actually in the game at the time. He did not make an appearance in the series.\n\nBranca began the 1953 season with Brooklyn, but was claimed off waivers by the Detroit Tigers on July 10, 1953. The Tigers released Branca in July 1954. After he pitched batting practice for the Yankees, the Yankees signed him, and used him in five games later in the season. Branca pitched for the Minneapolis Millers in 1955, but was released due to ineffectiveness caused by an arm injury.\n\nIn 1956, Branca appeared at Old Timer's Day for the Yankees, believing his career was over. His pitching velocity returned, and he signed with the Dodgers for the last month of the season, making one appearance.\n\nIn a 12-year career, Branca posted an 88–68 record with 829 strikeouts and a 3.79 ERA in 1,484 innings pitched.\n\nBranca became friends with Thomson, a bond that lasted into each man's old age, including joint television and trade show appearances. Branca later learned from Detroit Tiger Ted Gray that the Giants had stolen the signs to the two pitches he threw Thomson. That rumor was confirmed in \"The Wall Street Journal\" in 2001, when Giant Sal Yvars admitted that he relayed to Thomson the stolen signs for Branca's fastballs. Joshua Prager detailed the revelations in a book entitled \"The Echoing Green: The Untold Story of Bobby Thomson, Ralph Branca and The Shot Heard Round the World\". Thomson acknowledged to Prager that the Giants had stolen signs in 1951 but denied that he had foreknowledge of the pitch he hit off Branca for the pennant-winning home run. According to Branca, Thomson admitted to accepting the stolen signs during his first three at-bats of that game, but claimed that he did not do so in the final at-bat; Branca indicated that he did not believe Thomson's denials and remained convinced that Thomson was in fact tipped off on the fateful pitch.\n\nBranca ran the Baseball Assistance Team for seventeen years.\nBranca was a long time member of Westchester Country Club. He was born and raised in Mt. Vernon, New York where he was a member of the Westchester County Hall of Fame for about forty years. He was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nBranca was a pallbearer at Jackie Robinson's funeral in October 1972.\n\nBranca was a contestant on \"Concentration\" starting in 1963, where he won 17 consecutive games. He appeared in \"Concentration\"'s 1963 Challenge of Champions.\n\nIn the 2012 movie, \"Parental Guidance,\" Branca made a cameo appearance as a judge during a scene involving an audition for a music school. During the scene Billy Crystal's grandson takes to the stage and recites the radio broadcast of, \"The Shot Heard Round the World.\" Branca was portrayed by Hamish Linklater in the 2013 film \"42\", a biographical sports drama about Robinson's career. Branca was the subject of the 2013 documentary \"Branca's Pitch,\" produced by Andrew J. Muscato.\n\nBranca married Ann Mulvey, whose parents were part-owners of the Dodgers, in 1951, shortly after giving up the famous home run. Their daughter, Mary, married baseball player Bobby Valentine. Their other daughter Patti lives in Fort Myers, Florida. Branca released a memoir in 2011, titled \"A Moment in Time\".\n\nOn the morning of November 23, 2016, Branca died in a nursing home in Rye Brook, New York, at the age of 90. He was the last living member of the 1947 Dodgers baseball team. Branca was interred in Section 26 of Gate of Heaven Cemetery in suburban Westchester County. His grave is adjacent to Section 25, where Babe Ruth and Billy Martin are interred.\n\n\n\n"}

It operates on behalf of Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, catering to patients with psychiatric health needs that require treatment in conditions of high security. It is one of only three high security psychiatric hospitals in England, alongside Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire and Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.\n\nThe hospital has its origins in Moss Side House, a children's home established on the site in 1878. It served as a Red Cross hospital during the First World War. Park Lane Hospital opened as a Broadmoor overspill unit on the site in 1974. Moss Side Hospital and Park Lane Hospital merged to form Ashworth Hospital in 1989. The name \"Ashworth Hospital\" was chosen by a ballot among patients and staff.\n\nFollowing the death of a patient in 1988 and a series of other serious allegations, a Committee of Inquiry into Complaints about Ashworth Hospital, Merseyside, headed by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, was set up; it published its findings in 1992. Blom-Cooper was highly critical of the regime, which was felt to be more custodial than therapeutic. Seven staff and two managers were relieved of their duties.\n\nIn 1993 a patient's advocacy service was set up in the hospital. This was the first mental health advocacy service to be introduced in a high security hospital in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1997 a patient absconded from a day rehabilitation trip in protest against his treatment and the management of the Personality Disorder Unit. The Fallon inquiry, set up under the leadership of Peter Fallon QC, was established to investigate the allegations and reported in 1999. As a result of the Fallon Inquiry, a review into security was undertaken by Sir Richard Tilt, who recommended in May 2000, that security be upgraded to that of a Category B prison.\n\nAshworth is one of the three high-security psychiatric hospitals in England and Wales, alongside Rampton and Broadmoor, that exist to work with people who require treatment due to their \"dangerous, violent or criminal propensities\", with the majority experiencing psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia, comorbid or other personality disorders. Ashworth currently has 14 wards. A wide variety of pharmacological, rehabilitative and psychological treatments are available. Rehabilitative and creative activity is supported with patients frequently entering work for the Koestler awards winning 27 prizes in 2011. In collaboration with The Reader Organisation reading groups have been set up in which staff and patients read literature together, promoting confidence and developing communication and other skills.\n\n\n"}

All muscles consist of a number of motor units and the fibers belonging to a motor unit are dispersed and intermingle amongst fibers of other units. The muscle fibers belonging to one motor unit can be spread throughout part, or most of the entire muscle, depending on the number of fibers and size of the muscle. When a motor neuron is activated, all of the muscle fibers innervated by the motor neuron are stimulated and contract. \nThe activation of one motor neuron will result in a weak but distributed muscle contraction. The activation of more motor neurons will result in more muscle fibers being activated, and therefore a stronger muscle contraction. Motor unit recruitment is a measure of how many motor neurons are activated in a particular muscle, and therefore is a measure of how many muscle fibers of that muscle are activated. The higher the recruitment the stronger the muscle contraction will be. Motor units are generally recruited in order of smallest to largest (smallest motor neurons to largest motor neurons, and thus slow to fast twitch) as contraction increases. This is known as Henneman's size principle.\n\nHenneman proposed that the mechanism underlying the Size Principle was that the smaller motor neurons had a smaller surface area and therefore a higher membrane resistance. He predicted that the current generated by an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSPs) would result in a higher voltage change (depolarization) across the neuronal membrane of the smaller motor neurons and therefore larger EPSPs in smaller motoneurons. Burke later demonstrated that there was a graded decrease of both EPSP and inhibitory post synaptic potential (IPSP) amplitudes from small to large motoneurons. This seemed to confirm Henneman's idea, but Burke disagreed, pointing out that larger neurons with a larger surface area had space for more synapses. Burke eventually showed (in a very small sample of neurons) that smaller motoneurons have a greater number of synaptic inputs from a single input source. The topic is probably still regarded as controversial.\n\nUnder some circumstances, the normal order of motor unit recruitment may be altered, such that small motor units cease to fire and larger ones may be recruited. This is thought to be due to the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory motoneuronal inputs.\n\nThe force produced by a single motor unit is determined in part by the number of muscle fibers in the unit. Another important determinant of force is the frequency with which the muscle fibers are stimulated by their innervating axon. The rate at which the nerve impulses arrive is known as the motor unit firing rate and may vary from frequencies low enough to produce a series of single twitch contractions to frequencies high enough to produce a fused tetanic contraction. Generally, this allows a 2 to 4-fold change in force. In general, the motor unit firing rate of each individual motor unit increases with increasing muscular effort until a maximum rate is reached. This smooths out the incremental force changes which would otherwise occur as each additional unit was recruited.\n\nThe distribution of motor unit size is such that there is an inverse relationship between the number of motor units and the force each generates (i.e., the number of muscle fibers per motor unit). Thus, there are many small motor units and progressively fewer larger motor units. This means that at low levels of recruitment, the force increment due to recruitment is small, whereas in forceful contractions, the force increment becomes much larger. Thus the ratio between the force increment produced by adding another motor unit and the force threshold at which that unit is recruited remains relatively constant.\n\nIn medical electrodiagnostic testing for a patient with weakness, careful analysis of the \"motor unit action potential\" (MUAP) size, shape, and recruitment pattern can help in distinguishing a myopathy from a neuropathy.\n\n"}

She was one of two women among seven young architects who formed the firm with Walter Gropius in 1945. She was an inspirational figure for women in architecture throughout her long career; early on she valued the idea of accessible design and sustainable practices in architecture. She gave voice to these ideals in 1985 as President of the Boston Society of Architects.\n\nBorn Sarah Pillsbury in Swampscott, Massachusetts, but called Sally, she was the daughter of Samuel Hale Pillsbury, a lawyer, and the former Helen Farrington Watters. She graduated from the Winsor School and studied at the Cambridge School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, which was affiliated with Smith College. She also received a Master's certificate in Architecture. In 1941, she married John Cheesman \"Chip\" Harkness, one of the other co-founders of the Architects Collaborative, and they had seven children.\n\nShe attended the Smith College Graduate School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture in 1940. She was a founder, in 1945, and Principal Emeritus of the Architects' Collaborative (TAC).

This space consisted of a study space, dining area and coat storage. The independent Study Units were designed for Bedford Middle School. When introducing the Study Unit to the school, a choice was made that two-thirds of the students would have a Carrel and one-third would not. This decision was made through the assumption that not all students would be ready for the independence that the Carrel provides. The Carrels were placed with the storage units, this allowed students to chose between working with their table-mate or independently. This was accomplished by opening the door on their storage unit. For students to be social for lunch, the tables were moved away from the storage units and combined together. This made enough room for six students to eat at the combined table. The arrangement incorporated the students who did not have a Carrel. The Carrels also had screens that could be used to divide the students into groups. All the students' belongings were in their Carrel, including coats which were hung on pegs at the end of the storage units.\n\nSarah P. Harkness and Jean B. Fletcher were the only two female founding partners of TAC. They were both mothers, with Harkness having seven children and Fletcher having six. The women worked together to create a schedule that made it possible to work at the firm and to meet the responsibilities as mothers. The women worked half days; Fletcher would work in the morning and Harkness would work in the afternoon. The women also shared the same baby-sitter.\n"}

{"id": "2255554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255554", "title": "Objective correlative", "text": "Objective correlative\n\nIn literary criticism, an objective correlative is a group of things or events which systematically represent emotions.\n\nThe theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic T.S. Eliot, who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics. Helping define the objective correlative, Eliot's essay \"Hamlet and His Problems\", republished in his book \"The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism\" discusses his view of Shakespeare's incomplete development of Hamlet's emotions in the play \"Hamlet\". Eliot uses Lady Macbeth's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative: \"The artistic 'inevitability' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion….\", as a contrast to Hamlet. According to Eliot, the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him. The objective correlative's purpose is to express the character's emotions by \"showing\" rather than \"describing\" feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book \"Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory\" as \"...perhaps little more than the ancient distinction (first made by Plato) between mimesis and diegesis….\" (28). According to Formalist critics, this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work. \n\nThe \"occasion\" of Eugenio Montale is a further form of correlative.\nThe works of Eliot were translated into Italian by Montale, who earned the 1975 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nThe term was first coined by the American painter and poet Washington Allston (1779-1843), was introduced by T.S.Eliot, rather casually, into his essay \"Hamlet and His Problems\" (1919); its subsequent vogue in literary criticism, Eliot said, astonished him.\nIn \"Hamlet and His Problems\", Eliot used the term exclusively to refer to his claimed artistic mechanism whereby emotion is evoked in the audience:\nIt seems to be in deference to this principle that Eliot famously described the play \"Hamlet\" as \"most certainly an artistic failure\": Eliot felt that Hamlet's strong emotions \"exceeded the facts\" of the play, which is to say they were not supported by an \"objective correlative\". He acknowledged that such a circumstance is \"something which every person of sensibility has known\"; but felt that in trying to represent it dramatically, \"Shakespeare tackled a problem which proved too much for him\".\n\nOne possible criticism of Eliot's theory includes his assumption that an author's intentions concerning expression will be understood in one way only. This point is stated by Balachandra Rajan as quoted in David A. Goldfarb's \"New Reference Works in Literary Theory\" with these words: \"Eliot argues that there is a verbal formula for any given state of emotion which, when found and used, will evoke that state and no other.\"\n\nA famous haiku by Yosa Buson entitled, \"The Piercing Chill I Feel\" illustrates the use of objective correlative within poetry:The piercing chill I feel:<br>my dead wife's comb, in our bedroom,<br>under my heel...\n\nIn the Clint Eastwood movie \"Jersey Boys\", songwriter Bob Gaudio of \"The 4 Seasons\" is asked who the girl is in his song \"Cry For Me\". He makes reference to T.S. Eliot's topic, \"the Objective Correlative\", as the subject being every girl, or any girl. In adherence to this reference, the author allows himself the literary license to step outside the scope of his personal experience, and to conjecture about the emotions and responses inherent with the situation, and utilize the third party perspective in the first party presentation.\n\n\n\n"}

It was one of the first broadcasting companies wholly owned by African-Americans.\n\nInner City was founded in 1970 by a group of prominent African-American New Yorkers active in business and civic affairs. They were led by Percy Sutton, an attorney and a former president of the New York borough of Manhattan; and Clarence Jones, a former publisher of the \"New York Amsterdam News\". Sutton and Jones were joined by over fifty shareholders including legendary disk jockey Hal Jackson; Sutton's fellow \"Gang of Four\" member David Dinkins, who would later become New York's first African-American mayor; Wilbert (Bill) Tatum, who succeeded Jones as publisher of the \"Amsterdam News\"; future New York state senator and comptroller Carl McCall; Betty Shabazz, the widow of Black Muslim minister and civil rights leader Malcolm X, and musicians Billy Taylor and Roberta Flack. Dorothy Brunson, who would later become the first African-American woman to wholly own an American radio station, was an executive at the company during its early years.\n\nWLIB, owned by brothers Harry and Morris S. Novik and programmed to New York's black community, was Inner City's first acquisition, in 1972. The sale included a right of first refusal clause to later acquire sister station WLIB-FM, which was renamed WBLS; Inner City exercised the clause two years later. While WLIB continued largely as a talk radio outlet, WBLS's format transitioned from jazz to a progressive mix of black music, under the slogan \"The Total Black Experience in Sound.\" WBLS would experience a period of tremendous success from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s as it pioneered the urban contemporary format under program director Frankie Crocker, and the profile of Inner City rose with it.\n\nInner City later purchased radio stations in the Los Angeles area; Detroit; San Antonio, Texas (co-founder Percy Sutton's hometown); the San Francisco Bay Area; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Columbia, South Carolina; and Jackson, Mississippi. Inner City also owned a variety of other media assets, including two cable television joint ventures with Time Warner Cable in New York City and Philadelphia.\n\nThe company was also given the task of running and reviving the Apollo Theater in New York's Harlem. In this capacity, Inner City Broadcasting was a co-producer of the syndicated television variety series \"It's Showtime at the Apollo\".\n\nIn 1990 Percy Sutton retired as chairman of the board of Inner City Broadcasting, though he remained as chairman emeritus until his death in 2009. He was succeeded by his son Pierre Sutton, who served in that capacity until the firm's closure.\n\nIn 1999 Inner City lost control of the Apollo Theatre after an investigation by the New York State Attorney General's office (completed by Eliot Spitzer) found that members of the nonprofit Apollo Theatre Foundation, led by Charles Rangel, retained revenues generated by production of \"It's Showtime at the Apollo\". The final decision resulted in Rangel stepping down as chairman of the foundation; he was replaced by actor Ossie Davis. Time Warner took over operational control of the venue as part of the final decision.\n\nIn August 2004, ICBC redeemed nearly $140 million accreted value of redeemable preferred stock in a recapitalization led by GE Capital and Alta Communications, a Boston-based private equity firm. By 2006 Inner City had sold or otherwise disposed of the majority of its investments outside of its core radio stations. The last remaining investment, a 60 percent share in Philadelphia-based Urban Cable Works, was sold in November 2005 to Time Warner Cable.\n\nOn August 22, 2011, Inner City's creditors petitioned the United States Bankruptcy Court to force the firm's wholly owned subsidiary, Inner City Media Corporation, to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy on grounds that the company's executives failed to accept a buyout offer. The filing resulted in majority control of Inner City being taken over by YMF Media LLC, controlled jointly by investor Ronald Burkle and former NBA player Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. YMF Media eventually purchased 15 Inner City stations for $180 million on October 19, 2012; the firm then broke up the group in a series of subsequent sales during 2013–2014.\n\n"}

In 1939, it was taken over by Jim Russell, who changed it to its current title. The strip was continued by Russell until his death on August 15, 2001. That made \"The Potts\" one of the longest-running comic strips of all time and, with 62 years of syndication, the longest-running cartoon strip drawn by the same single artist, beating the record previously held by Frank Dickens' \"Bristow\", which was in syndication for over 51 years, and Marc Sleen's \"The Adventures of Nero\", which was in syndication for a period of 45 years.\n\nThe strip first appeared in \"The Sun News-Pictorial\" in Melbourne. From 1957 to 1962, it was syndicated in the United States by LaFave Newspaper Features, renamed \"Uncle Dick\".\n\nIn August 1920 Stan Cross published the first episode of a comic strip known as \"You & Me\" in \"Smith's Weekly\". Cross continued to draw the weekly strip for nineteen years until he left \"Smith's\" in late December 1939 to join the \"Melbourne Herald\", taking the character of Whalesteeth with him. \n\nIn January 1940 the responsibility for \"You & Me\" was given to Cross' staff colleague, Jim Russell, who subsequently lightened the tone of the strip and changed the title to \"Mr & Mrs Potts\". Russell resigned from \"Smith's Weekly\" after a dispute with the new editor, and not long after in October 1950 \"Smith's Weekly\" ceased publication. In a complex financial arrangement, the \"Melbourne Herald\" acquired copyright to \"Mr & Mrs Potts\" and Russell resumed drawing the strip as a daily. \n\nThe modified \"Mr & Mrs Potts\" was sold to The Herald and Weekly Times group, first as a daily, then as a Sunday. The new version, \"The Potts\", first appeared in \"The Sun News-Pictorial\" on 23 January 1951, and in most other Australian states shortly afterwards. In October 1953, with the merger in Sydney of the \"Sunday Sun\" and the \"Sunday Herald\", the strip moved to the newly-created \"Sun-Herald\". By 1958, it had become an international strip, with an estimated daily circulation of 15 million, appearing in New Zealand, Turkey, Canada, Finland, Sri Lanka, and 35 United States newspapers. \n\nIn 1976, Russell retired from the \"Melbourne Herald\" as a writer and cartoonist, but continued to produce \"The Potts\" under a special arrangement which saw the copyright to the strip transferred to him.\n\nInitially the strip only featured two characters, Pott and Whalesteeth, and was designed as a means of offering political comment. The name of the first was derived from rhyming slang in which \"the old pot and pan\" stood for \"the old man\"; the name of the second referred to the character's prominently-displayed teeth, which, when he grinned or grimaced, took possession of the entire lower portion of his face. The political nature of the comic was short-lived and Cross was asked to continue it as a domestic humour strip. \n\nMrs. Potts was introduced in November 1920, and with her came the marital disputes and slanging matches which were to characterise the strip under Cross. In terms of drinking, arguing, swearing and displays of bad temper, \"You & Me\" remains unique in Australian comic book history and pre-dated \"Andy Capp\" by almost 40 years.\n\nUnder Russell, the editors insisted that the strip become \"more genteel\", so he introduced new characters: a daughter, Ann, a son-in-law, Herb, grandchildren, Mike and Bunny, and Uncle Dick, a good-natured scrounger. \n\nUsing Uncle Dick (Mrs. Potts' uncle), Russell felt he could \"sneak\" into the strip the less attractive elements that had been excised from the main characters. Often seen as semi-autobiographical, Uncle Dick was apparently initially based on the character Sheridan Whiteside in the 1941 film, \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" (played by Monty Woolley, supposedly based on American critic Alexander Woollcott), although Russell later wryly admitted: \"I’ve grown more like Uncle Dick and Uncle Dick has grown more like me. My wife says he is me\".\n\n"}

State Route 696's southern terminus is at an interchange with the U.S. Route 30 expressway about east of Beaverdam.\n\nEstablished in the late 1930s, State Route 696 is a two-lane highway that runs through parts of Allen and Putnam Counties. While the northern terminus of State Route 696 has remained static through the years, its southern terminus has been in three different locations throughout the Beaverdam area.\n\nState Route 696 travels through northeastern Allen County and southeastern Putnam County. No part of State Route 696 is included within the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country.\n\n1939 marked the year of inception for State Route 696. Its original routing consisted of the majority of the current alignment of the highway, running between the downtown Beaverdam intersection of Main Street (then a part of U.S. Route 30 and West Street {at the time a part of U.S. Route 25 and its current northern terminus at State Route 12 just west of Pandora. In 1955, a new by-pass that would later become a part of the Interstate 75 freeway was opened around the south and east sides of Beaverdam. U.S. Route 25 was re-routed onto this new stretch of highway. Consequently, State Route 696 was extended a short distance south along the former routing of U.S. Route 25 and a small portion of county-maintained Napoleon Road to end at the U.S. Route 25 by-pass. \n\nThen, in 1999, State Route 696's southern terminus was moved one more time. With the completion of the new U.S. Route 30 expressway heading east from the Beaverdam vicinity to State Route 235, State Route 696 was re-routed east from the intersection of West Street and Main Street in downtown Beaverdam, along the old two-lane alignment of U.S. Route 30, crossing Interstate 75 at its Exit 135, and then going on to a signalized intersection with a connector roadway that links with the newly aligned U.S. Route 30 expressway at a new trumpet interchange. State Route 696 was routed south onto this connector,\nand then arrived at what is now its southern terminus at that interchange with U.S. Route 30.\n"}

She lives in Plainfield, Vermont. She produces original prints and has illustrated over 50 books.\n\nAzarian grew up on her grandfather's farm on the outskirts of Washington, DC. Her grandfather's farm had thousands of chicken along with geese that would bother the customers that came to buy his eggs. Azarian's uncle grew vegetables. Being around her family gardens is what sparked her high interest in it. When she was young, she would spend her time exploring the woods and fields with her pony named Pasty.\n\nShe began drawing and painting at an early age. In 4th grade, she did her first relief print of woodcuts and enjoyed it very much. This piece of art was a 3\" x 4\" lino block of an angel with the name NOEL at the bottom. She ran into a problem and learned a valuable lesson from this project; words must be reversed when doing a woodcut. Her finished product read LEON.\n\nAzarian continued to lino cuts until she later attended Smith College, where she studied printmaking and painting with one of the great 20th century printmakers, Leonard Baskin.\n\nAfter she graduated from Smith College, she moved to farm in Vermont. Azarian and her husband farmed horses, oxen, chickens, a jersey milk cow, a sheep, and a goat. Azarian and her husband made their three sons help them with their gardens.\n\nBefore beginning her career as a full-time artist, Azarian taught in a one-room schoolhouse for three years. After she finished her three years of teaching, she decided she wanted to make a living selling woodcut prints. She began producing her prints by hand and in black and white. Eventually, she began adding color to her prints by hand. Finally, she found an old Vandercook proof press and began using it to produce the prints.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, Azarian begun illustrating children’s books. In 1999, the American Library Association awarded Azarian the Caldecott Medal for her illustrations in the children's book, Snowflake Bentley.\n\nAzarian is married to her husband Tom and together they have three sons.\n\n\n"}

The silversword in general is referred to as \"āhinahina\" in Hawaiian (literally, \"very gray\").\n\nThe Haleakala silversword is found on the island of Maui at elevations above on the dormant Haleakalā volcanoon the summit depression, the rim summits, and surrounding slopesin Haleakalā National Park.\nThe Haleakala silversword has been a threatened species as defined by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, since May 15, 1992. Prior to that time, excessive grazing by cattle and goats, and vandalism inflicted by people in the 1920s, had caused its near extinction. Since strict monitoring and governmental protection took effect, the species' recovery is considered a successful conservation story, although threats remain.\n\nThe Haleakala silversword, \"Argyroxiphium sandwicense\" subsp. \"macrocephalum\", has numerous sword-like succulent leaves covered with silver hairs. Silversword plants in general grow on volcanic cinder, a dry, rocky substrate that is subject to freezing temperatures and high winds. The skin and hairs are strong enough to resist the wind and freezing temperature of this altitude and protect the plant from dehydration and the sun.\n\nThe plant's base of leaves, arranged in a spherical formation at ground level of the plant, dominates for the majority of the plant's lifewhich may be greater than 50 years. The leaves are arranged so that they and the hairs of the leaves can raise the temperature of the shoot-tip leaves up to , having adapted to the extreme high-altitude temperatures by focusing the sunlight to converge at this point and warm the plant.\n\nThe other subspecies, \"Argyroxiphium sandwicense\" subsp. \"sandwicense\" (Mauna Kea silversword), is found on Mauna Kea. They differ primarily in the inflorescence shapebroader in the Haleakalā plants (less than 4 times as long as wide) and narrower on Mauna Kea (4.3–8.6 times as long as wide). The Haleakala subspecies also generally has more ray florets, 11–42 versus 5–20 for Mauna Kea.\n\nAt senescence, which often occurs when the plant reaches a diameter of approximately , the plant produces a tall stalk in just a few weeks of maroon ray flowers which resemble the sunflower. Flowering usually occurs from July through October. The leaves become limp and dry as the monocarpic plant then goes to seed and dies.\n\nThe flowering stalk may have up to 600 heads of up to 40 outlying ray flowers and 600 disk flowers and is pollinated by flying insects like \"Hylaeus\" (\"Nesoprosopis\") \"volcanicus\". The flower stalk can reach up to in height and has numerous tiny sticky hairs to prevent crawling insects from damaging the plant. Seeding is a critical time because damage to the flowers or stalk by insects before the seeds can mature can jeopardize the plant's entire reproductive output.\n\nBefore the National Park Service was granted control of Haleakalā volcano, visitors to the volcano's summit often participated in the common practice of uprooting a silversword plant and then rolling it on the jagged lava rock terrain, drying the flowers for arrangements, or using the plant as kindling. Because the delicate, shallow root structure can be crushed by walking in the rocks around the plant, they are very sensitive to foreign elements. Feeding by goats also severely damaged many plants and prevented reproduction. Ungulates are now fenced out of the crater area and the species is legally protected from damage by humans.\n\n\n\n"}

Jim's brother Dan Russell was also a cartoonist.\n\nRussell has entered the Guinness Book of Records for drawing the same comic strip singlehandedly without any assistance for a period of over 62 years, beating the record previously held by Frank Dickens' \"Bristow\", which was in syndication for over 51 years, and Marc Sleen's \"The Adventures of Nero\", which was in syndication for a period of 45 years.\n\nRussell was born in Campsie, New South Wales, the son of William John \"Billy\" Russell, a foreman plumber with the Sydney City Council, the president of the New South Wales Plumbers' Union, the national secretary of the Australian Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union, and unsuccessful labour candidate for the seats of Parkes and Canterbury, who was killed in a workplace accident in 1915. His mother Catherine Elizabeth (née Diggs), remarried in 1926 and was one of the first two-woman members of an Australian Upper House of Parliament. Russell was educated at Tempe Technical School and Christian Brothers' High School, Lewisham In 1924 at age 14 he began work as a copy boy on the \"Daily Guardian\" before transferring later that year to \"Smith's Weekly\", working as an art room messenger boy to Stan Cross. Russell also studied at the Julian Ashton Art School in Sydney, for six years, while working at various jobs, including a box office attendant at the Sydney Stadium. This led to a brief boxing career, which included winning all five bouts as a welterweight at the Sydney Stadium. During this time he improved his drawing, with sketches he made of notable boxers being published in various Sydney papers. In 1926 the head artist of Fox Films offered to tutor Russell in the basics of art, for which he paid £100 and worked unpaid there for two years.\n\nRussell became Australia's youngest political cartoonist, when in 1928 (at the age of nineteen) he got a job as cartoonist on the \"Sydney Sunday News\" until the paper folded in 1931. Russell briefly went to the \"Referee\" as sports caricaturist until he rejoined \"Smith's Weekly\" and by 1933 was Australia's youngest daily cartoonist, In 1939 he temporarily abandoned cartooning and accompanied the Australian Davis Cup team to the United States as a tennis writer. The team won the cup just as World War II broke out. Russell tried to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force, unsuccessfully.\n\nWhen Stan Cross left \"Smith's\" in 1940 Russell succeeded him as art editor and also took over drawing Cross's comic strips, including \"You and Me\", which he renamed \"Mr and Mrs Pott\", and from 1950, \"The Potts\". Through the war years Russell was responsible for two satirical strips, \"Adolf, Herman and Musso\" (which made fun of Adolf Hitler, Hermann Göring and Benito Mussolini) and \"Schmit der Sphy\". He won 1st prize in the Voluntary Services section in the National Gallery of Victoria's 1945 \"Australia at War\" exhibition.\n\nRussell branched out into comic books during the 1940s when import restrictions gave Australian comics a lion's share of the market. At the beginning of 1947, Jim and his older brother, Dan, began their own publishing company, \"All-Australian Comics\". The lead title of the company was \"Tex Morton's Wild West Comics\", starring the popular country music singer. Like many Australian comics of the time, it was a copy of American material, in this case, featuring cowboy actors such as Roy Rogers and Gene Autry. Tex Morton was always featured in a lead-off story along with his mates Jacky, Shorty and Slim, drawn by Dan Russell. For the first two years companion features were Keith Chatto's \"Bunny Allen\", Les Dixon's \"Alfie the Jackaroo\" and a series of bush yarns by Jack Hemming. Early in 1949 they added another title, \"Kanga's K.O. Comics\", with the lead strip drawn by Russell, who used the pseudonym 'Mick Newton'. Russell also used the pseudonym on a revised version of \"Wanda Dare\" in Tex Morton Comics (the earlier version of \"Wanda Dare\", a lady reporter, having previously been drawn by Dan).\n\nIn the middle of 1950 \"All-Australian Comics\" ran into financial difficulties due to rising production costs and the company folded by the end of the year. Russell resigned from \"Smith's Weekly\" after a dispute with the new editor, and not long after, in October 1950, \"Smith's Weekly\" folded. By a complex financial arrangement, the \"Melbourne Herald\" had acquired copyright to \"The Potts\", and he resumed drawing the strip in its new role as a daily\n\nRussell also wrote film reviews and other articles, was a radio and television personality, a publisher of dancing and music magazines and ran two travel agencies.\n\nIn 1924 Russell was one of the founders of the Black and White Artists' Club. He succeeded Cross as president in 1955–57, then again in 1965–73. He won the Club's first Silver Stanley in 1985 for his contribution to black and white art, was appointed its patron in 1984 and a life member in 1991. In 1993 he was elected a member of the United States National Cartoonists Society, the only Australian ever to receive this honour.\n\nRussell married Lillian \"Billie\" Brann (d. 1995) in 1931; they had a daughter Judith Aileen. He died 15 August 2001.\n\nIn 1978 he was awarded the MBE, then later the AM.\n\nThe Australian Cartoonist's Association Silver Stanley Award is now known as the Jim Russell Award and is awarded to a cartoonist for services to the cartooning industry.

{"id": "2255603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255603", "title": "The Pirate Movie", "text": "The Pirate Movie\n\nThe Pirate Movie is a 1982 Australian musical romantic comedy film directed by Ken Annakin and starring Christopher Atkins and Kristy McNichol. Loosely based on Gilbert and Sullivan's 1879 comic opera \"The Pirates of Penzance\", the original music score is composed by Mike Brady and Peter Sullivan (no relation to \"Pirates of Penzance\" composer Arthur Sullivan).\n\nThe film performed far below expectations in initial release and is generally reviewed very poorly, but fared far more positively with audiences. It has developed a cult following following home media release and TV airings.\n\nMabel Stanley (Kristy McNichol) is an introverted and bookish teenage girl from the United States in a seaside community in Australia as an exchange student. She attends a local pirate festival featuring a swordplay demonstration led by a young curly-haired instructor and fellow American (Christopher Atkins), who then invites her for a ride on his boat. She is duped by her exchange family sisters, Edith (Kate Ferguson), Kate (Rhonda Burchmore), and Isabel (Catherine Lynch), into missing the launch, so she rents a small sailboat to give chase. A sudden storm throws her overboard, and she washes up on a beach.\n\nShe subsequently dreams an adventure that takes place a century before. In this fantasy sequence, the swordplay instructor is now named Frederic, a young apprentice of the Pirates of Penzance, celebrating his 21st birthday on a pirate vessel. Frederic refuses an invitation from the Pirate King (Ted Hamilton), his adoptive father, to become a full pirate, as his birth parents were murdered by their contemporaries. Frederic swears to avenge their deaths and is forced off of the ship on a small boat.\n\nAdrift, Frederic spies Mabel and her older sisters on a nearby island and swims to shore to greet them. In a reversal of roles, Mabel is a confident, assertive, and courageous young woman, while her sisters are prim, proper and conservative. Frederic quickly falls for Mabel and proposes marriage, but local custom requires the elder sisters to marry first.\n\nSoon, Frederic's old mates come ashore, also looking for women and kidnap Mabel's sisters. Major-General Stanley (Bill Kerr), Mabel's father, arrives and convinces the Pirate King to free his daughters and leave in peace. The pirates anchor their ship just outside the harbour instead of actually leaving. Mabel wants Frederic to gain favour with her father so they can marry, so she plots to recover the family treasure stolen years earlier by the pirates. Unfortunately, the treasure was lost at sea, but the location where it lies was tattooed as a map on the Pirate King's back. Mabel successfully tricks the Pirate King into revealing his tattoo while Frederic sketches a copy. After Mabel manages to escape from him, she and Fredrick, who has sabotaged the pirate's ship, leap over board and swim for safety. The pirate's open fire on them, but the ship partially sinks, enabling them to escape.\n\nThe next day, Mabel and Frederic recover the stolen treasure and present it to her father. The Major-General is underwhelmed as he believes the treasure will simply be stolen again once the pirates realise it is missing. Mabel dispatches Frederic to raise an army for protection, but the Pirate King interferes. The ship nurse, Ruth, convinces them to stop fighting, reminding the Pirate King of Frederic's apprenticeship contract. Frederic's birthday is 29 February, and he is dismayed to see that the contract specifies his twenty-first \"birthday\", rather than his twenty-first \"year\". As his birthday occurs every four years, Frederic has celebrated only five birthdays and is still bound by contract to remain with the pirates.\n\nThat night, the pirates raid the Stanley estate, and the Pirate King orders their execution. Mabel demands a \"happy ending\" – admitting for the first time that she believes this all to be a dream. Everyone – even the pirates – cheers their approval, leaving the Pirate King disappointed and shocked. Mabel then confronts her father, but the Major-General is steadfast that the marriage custom remains in effect. Mabel quickly pairs each of her older sisters with a pirate, and she also pairs the Pirate King to Ruth. With Mabel and Frederic now free to marry, the fantasy sequence ends in song and dance.\n\nMabel awakens back on the beach to discover that she is wearing the wedding ring that Frederic had given her in her dream. At that moment, the handsome swordplay instructor arrives and lifts her to her feet. He passionately kisses Mabel, who is still shaken by her dream. She asks if his name is Frederic. He assures her that he isn't who she imagines him to be, but then carries her off to marry her, thus giving Mabel her happy ending in reality as well.\n\n\nThe film was the idea of actor Ted Hamilton, who became executive producer. Richard Franklin was first announced as director but then Ken Annakin got the job, and was rushed into production when Joseph Papp announced that he was going to produce a film version of his Broadway production of \"The Pirates of Penzance\".\n\nPrincipal photography was shot at the Polly Woodside at South Melbourne wharf, the Farm and Mansion at Werribee Park and Loch Ard on the Great Ocean Road Port Campbell from November 1981 to January 1982.\n\nSecondary locations included various parts of Sydney, namely McDonald's Cremorne (in the beginning sequences, after Fred invites Mabel and her friends on the boat), Rush Cutters Bay Marina (where Mabel obtains a small sailboat), and Palm Beach for some of the beach scenes.\n\nThe Pirate Movie soundtrack album was released by Polydor Records in August 1982 on vinyl and cassette. The album reached number 166 on the American \"Billboard\" 200, while the single \"How Can I Live Without Her\" peaked at number 71 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\n\n\"The Pirate Movie\" was made soon after the 1980 New York City Central Park and 1981 Broadway theatre production of \"The Pirates of Penzance\" produced by Joseph Papp, which re-popularized swashbuckling pirates as a theatrical genre.\n\nThe film earned A$1,013,000 at the Australian box office. In the United States, the film grossed $7,983,086.\n\nThe film holds a 9% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 2.23/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 19 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \"Overwhelming Dislike\". \"The Irish Times\" review called \"The Pirate Movie\" a \"travesty\" of the Gilbert and Sullivan original and said \"with a philosophy of shove everything in regardless, it's nothing more than a waste of Miss McNichol's abilities, the audience's time and the incentives offered to make films in Australia.\" \"Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide\" rated the film as a BOMB and stated: \"Not only trashes the original, but also fails on its own paltry terms. It should have been called \"The Rip-off Movie\"\".\"TV Guide\" stated \"Pop tunes are mixed in with some of the original G&S songs in a pirate period setting that grates on the nerves, as does the inane toilet humor that substitutes for wit. All the performers, especially McNichol, look as if they can't wait until the film is over, and one can hardly blame them.\" In contrast, the audience was much more forgiving, giving it a 76% audience rating. Michael and Harry Medved's book \"Son of Golden Turkey Awards\" includes \"The Pirate Movie's\" \"First Love\" on its list of \"Worst Rock 'N Roll Lyrics in a Movie\".\n\nAustralian film critic Michael Adams later included \"The Pirate Movie\" on his list of the worst ever Australian films, along with \"Phantom Gold\", \"The Glenrowan Affair\", \"Houseboat Horror\", \"Welcome to Woop Woop\", \"Les Patterson Saves the World\" and \"Pandemonium\".\n\nThe film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book \"The Official Razzie Movie Guide\" as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.\n\n"}
{"id": "2255608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255608", "title": "Tephritidae", "text": "Tephritidae\n\nThe Tephritidae are one of two fly families referred to as fruit flies, the other family being the Drosophilidae. The family Tephritidae does not include the biological model organisms of the genus \"Drosophila\" (in the family Drosophilidae), which is often called the \"common fruit fly\". Nearly 5,000 described species of tephritid fruit fly are categorized in almost 500 genera of the Tephritidae. Description, recategorization, and genetic analyses are constantly changing the taxonomy of this family. To distinguish them from the Drosophilidae, the Tephritidae are sometimes called peacock flies, in reference to their elaborate and colorful markings. The name comes from the Greek τεφρος, \"tephros\", meaning \"ash grey\". They are found in all the ecozones.\n\nFor terms see Morphology of Diptera and Tephritidae glossary\n\nTephritids are small to medium-sized (2.5–10 mm) flies that are often colourful, and usually with pictured wings, the subcostal vein curving forward at a right angle. The head is hemispherical and usually short. The face is vertical or retreating and the frons is broad. Ocelli and cellar bristles are present. The postvertical bristles are parallel to divergent. Two to eight pairs of frontal bristles are seen (at least one but usually several lower pairs curving inwards and at least one of the upper pairs curving backwards). In some species, the frontal bristles are inserted on a raised tubercle. Interfrontal setulae are usually absent or represented by one or two tiny setulae near the lunula. True vibrissae are absent, but several genera have strong bristles near the vibrissal angle. The wings usually have yellow, brown, or black markings or are dark-coloured with lighter markings. In a few species, the wings are clear. The costa has both a humeral and a subcostal break. The apical part of the subcostal is usually indistinct or even transparent and at about a right angle with respect to the basal part. Crossvein BM-Cu is present; the cell cup (posterior cubital cell or anal cell) is closed and nearly always narrowing to an acute angle. It is closed by a geniculated vein (CuA2). The CuA2 vein is rarely straight or convex. The tibiae lack a dorsal preapical bristle. The female has an oviscape.\n\nThe larva is amphipneustic (having only the anterior and posterior pairs of spiracle). The body varies from white to yellowish or brown. The posterior end of pale-coloured species is sometimes black. The body tapers at the anterior. The two mandibles sometimes have teeth along the ventral margin. The antennomaxillary lobes at each side of the mandibles have several transverse oral ridges or short laminae directed posteriorly. The anterior spiracles (prothoracic spiracles) end bluntly and are not elongated. Each has at least three openings or up to 50 arranged transversely in one to three groups or irregularly. Each posterior spiracle (anal spiracle) lacks a clearly defined peritreme and each has three spiracular openings (in mature larvae). These are usually more or less horizontal, parallel and usually bear branched spiracular hairs in four tufts.\n\nThe larvae of almost all Tephritidae are phytophagous. Females deposit eggs in living, healthy plant tissue using their telescopic ovipositors. Here, the larvae find their food upon emerging. The larvae develop in leaves, stems, flowers, seeds, fruits, and roots of the host plant, depending on the species. Some species are gall-forming. One exception to the phytophagous lifestyle is \"Euphranta toxoneura\" (Loew) whose larvae develop in galls formed by sawflies.The adults sometimes have a very short lifespan. Some live for less than a week. Some species are monophagous (feeding on only one plant species) others are polyphagous (feeding on several, usually related plant species).\n\nThe behavioral ecology of tephritid fruit flies is of great interest to biologists. Some fruit flies have extensive mating rituals or territorial displays. Many are brightly colored and visually showy. Some fruit flies show Batesian mimicry, bearing the colors and markings of dangerous arthropods such as wasps or jumping spiders because it helps the fruit flies avoid predation, though the flies lack stingers.\n\nAdult tephritid fruit flies are often found on the host plant and feeding on pollen, nectar, rotting plant debris, or honeydew.\n\nNatural enemies include the Diapriidae and the Braconidae.\n\nTephritid fruit flies are of major economic importance in agriculture. Some have negative effects, some positive. Various species of fruit flies cause damage to fruit and other plant crops. The genus \"Bactrocera\" is of worldwide notoriety for its destructive impact on agriculture. The olive fruit fly (\"B. oleae\"), for example, feeds on only one plant: the wild or commercially cultivated olive, \"Olea europaea\". It has the capacity to ruin 100% of an olive crop by damaging the fruit. \"Bactrocera dorsalis\" is another highly invasive pest species that damages tropical fruit, vegetable, and nut crops.\" Euleia heraclei\" is a pest of celery and parsnips. The genus \"Anastrepha\" includes several important pests, notably \"A. grandis\", \"A. ludens\" (Mexican fruit fly), \"A. obliqua\", and \"A. suspensa\". Other pests are \"Strauzia longipennis\", a pest of sunflowers and \"Rhagoletis mendax\", a pest of blueberries. Another notorious agricultural pest is the Mediterranean fruit fly or Medfly, \"Ceratitis capitata\", which is responsible for millions of dollars' worth in expenses by countries for control and eradication efforts, in addition to costs of damage to fruit crops. Similarly, the Queensland fruit fly (\"Bactrocera tyroni\") is responsible for more than $28.5 million in damage to Australian fruit crops a year. This species lays eggs in a wide variety of unripe fruit hosts, causing them to rot prior to ripening. \n\nSome fruit flies are used as agents of biological control, thereby reducing the populations of pest species. Several species of the genus \"Urophora\" are used as control agents against rangeland-destroying noxious weeds such as starthistles and knapweeds, but their effectiveness is questionable. \"Urophora sirunaseva\" produces larvae that pupate within a woody gall within the flower and disrupt seed production. \"Chaetorellia acrolophi\" is an effective biocontrol agent against knapweeds \"Chaetorellia australis\" and \"Chaetorellia succinea\", deposit eggs into the starthistle seedheads, where their larvae consume the seeds and flower ovaries.\n\nSince economically important tephritid fruit flies exist worldwide, vast networks of researchers, several international symposia, and intensive activities on various subjects extend from ecology to molecular biology (Tephritid Workers Database).\n\nPest management techniques applied to tephritid include the use of cover sprays with conventional pesticides, however, due to deleterious impact of these pesticides, new, less impactful and more targeted pest control techniques have been used, such as toxic food baits, male annihilation technique using specific male attractant parapheromones in toxic baits or mass trapping, or even sterile insect technique as part of integrated pest management.\n\nTephritidae is divided into several subfamilies:\n\nThe genera \"Oxyphora\", \"Pseudorellia\", and \"Stylia\" comprise 32 species, and are not included in any subfamily (\"incertae sedis\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the son of retired 13-year NBA veteran Gerald Wilkins and nephew of nine-time NBA All-Star Dominique Wilkins.\n\nAfter graduating from Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, Florida, Wilkins enrolled at North Carolina State University. Two years into a quick and promising start to his NCAA career at North Carolina State, Wilkins entered the 2001 NBA Draft but decided to withdraw and transfer to University of Georgia. There, he had two solid but unspectacular seasons and went undrafted in 2004. \n\nDiligence in the weight room helped Wilkins have a big summer league and shine in preseason action for the Sonics, allowing him to make the team. After working after practice, Wilkins got his shot towards the end of his rookie season and scored 21 points at Portland on March 24, 2005. Wilkins would start seven games the rest of the way as the Sonics battled injuries. He proved himself in the 2005 Playoffs when injuries struck again, finishing with 15 points, six rebounds and five steals in the Sonics' Game 4 win over San Antonio. A restricted free agent in the summer of 2005, Wilkins received an offer from the Minnesota Timberwolves in August 2005, which the Sonics matched within 7 days.\nIn the 2007 season, the departure of Rashard Lewis and Ray Allen made Wilkins a starter.

In 1992 and 1993, they scored four hit singles on the ARIA Charts with cover versions of \"Be My Baby\" (No. 6, May 1992), \"I Can't Help Myself\" (No. 28, July 1992), \"Love How You Love Me\" (No. 14, September 1992) and \"Baby It's You\" (No. 91, April 1993). The group's debut album, \"Get Happy!\", was released in November 1992, which peaked at No. 36. The group disbanded in 1993. Their singles \"I Can't Help Myself\" and \"Love How You Love Me\" were nominated for Engineer of the Year at the 1993 ARIA Awards. From 1998 to 2008, Crawford was a member of Hi-5, a children's music group aligned with a TV series of the same name.\n\nThe Teen Queens were formed in Sydney in 1992 by three model-singer-actresses: Roxanne Clarke, Kellie Crawford (née Hoggart) and Liza Witt. A pilot episode was developed by the creators of \"E Street\", a teen TV soap opera, for a self-titled half-hour TV program about a girl group set in 1960s. According to \"The Canberra Times\" correspondent the show \"follows three girls from the country who head to the city to make it big in the music world. Naturally all doesn't go according to plan.\"\n\nBy the time that the pilot was turned down, the trio had made the group a reality as a dance-pop act. In May 1992 their cover version of the Ronettes' \"Be My Baby\" became a No. 6 hit on the ARIA Singles Chart. Their debut album, \"Get Happy!\", was released on Westside Records/Phonogram in November 1992 and reached No. 36 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It included \"some classic songs from the '60s.\" Bevan Hannan of \"The Canberrra Times\" rated the album at 3 out of 10, he felt that it was \"Manufactured pop... for aspiring musicians (?) like the Teen Queens, who supposedly have the world at their feet, why would you choose to play the type of material that clapped out rockers use on the RSL club circuit? \"Get Happy!\" is a bit like that... it would probably be better to tune in to 2CA, or better still purchase one of the '60s rock box collections. The originals blow away this regurgitated stuff.\"\n\nThe group also provided the vocals for a Coca-Cola TV ad. In July 1992, the Teen Queens appeared on \"E Street\" as contestants on a fictitious, in-show dating game, \"Dream Date\". They had further top 40 singles including The Four Tops' \"I Can't Help Myself\" (No. 28) in July 1992 and The Paris Sisters' \"Love How You Love Me\" (No. 14) in September 1992. The latter track featured on an episode of \"E Street\" for the wedding theme for the characters of Toni and CJ. A final single, a cover version of The Shirelles and The Beatles' \"Baby It's You\" was released in April 1993, which peaked at No. 91. In June that year they performed the track on TV's \"Midday\" show, with backing by the station's Geoff Harvey band. A second album, \"Get Happy! II\", was released in July 1993 before the group disbanded.\n\nAfter the Teen Queens split in 1993, each member pursued solo projects.

His father was a minister of the Presbyterian Church. Black attended Wabash College, Crawfordsville, Indiana, and became a lawyer.\n\nOn April 14, 1861, Black (along with his brother, William P. Black) entered the Union Army as a private in the 11th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment on April 14, 1861. He became sergeant major on April 25, 1861.\n\nAfter three months of service, the brothers were mustered out of the volunteers and organized Company \"K\" of the 37th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. John Black became major of the regiment on September 5, 1861. He was wounded in the right arm at the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, on March 7, 1862. In July 12, 1862, John Black was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and became commander of the 37th Illinois Infantry. Black led his regiment against a fortified Confederate position during the Battle of Prairie Grove, Arkansas, on December 7, 1862. The unit suffered heavy casualties and was eventually forced to retreat. Black himself was seriously wounded. An 1896 review of numerous actions during the war resulted in John Black being awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Prairie Grove. Black's brother William also received the medal, making them the first of five pairs of brothers to both receive the Medal of Honor as of 2005.\n\nOn December 31, 1862, Black was promoted to colonel of the 37th Illinois Infantry Regiment.

Oren has been a visiting professor at Harvard, Yale, and Georgetown universities in the United States and at Tel Aviv and Hebrew universities in Israel. He was a Distinguished Fellow at the Shalem Center in Jerusalem and a contributing editor to \"The New Republic\". \"The Forward\" named Oren one of the five most influential American Jews and \"The Jerusalem Post\" listed him as one of the world's ten most influential Jews.\n\nOren retired as ambassador to the United States in 2013, replaced by Ron Dermer. In the 2015 Israeli election, Oren was elected to the Knesset for the centrist Kulanu party.\n\nOren was born Michael Scott Bornstein in upstate New York, the son of Marilyn (née Goldstein), a marriage and family therapist, and Lester Milton Bornstein, a hospital director. His father had served as an officer in the U.S. Army who took part in the D-Day invasion of Normandy and in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 and participated in the Korean War. Oren grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, in a Conservative Jewish household. He attended West Orange High School. As the only Jewish boy in a heavily Catholic neighborhood, he says he experienced antisemitism. In his youth, he was an activist in Zionist and Jewish youth groups such as United Synagogue Youth. A meeting with then–Israeli ambassador to the United States, Yitzhak Rabin, strengthened Oren's decision to move to Israel. Reading about Rabin sparked Oren's interest in the Israeli ambassadorship to Washington, a post he would eventually attain. Oren won two gold medals at the 1977 Maccabiah Games in rowing, a sport in which he remains active. At age 15, he made his first trip to Israel with the youth movement Habonim Dror, working on Kibbutz Gan Shmuel. In 1973, Oren won first prize in the PBS National Young Filmmaker's contest for the film, \"Comrades in Arms\", which he wrote and directed. In the summer of 1976, he worked as gofer for Orson Welles.\n\nIn 1977 Oren completed his undergraduate degree from Columbia College. He continued his studies at Columbia, receiving a Masters in International Affairs in 1978 from the School of International and Public Affairs, where he was an International Fellow and a DACOR Fellow. After college, he spent a year as an adviser to the Israeli delegation to the United Nations.\n\nIn 1979 Oren emigrated to Israel. Upon assuming Israeli citizenship, he changed his last name from \"Bornstein\" to \"Oren\", meaning \"pine tree\" in Hebrew. (He renounced his American citizenship in 2009 upon his nomination as ambassador to the United States, since Israeli law prohibits international representatives from holding dual nationality.)\n\nA few years later Oren returned to the United States to continue his education, studying at Princeton University. In 1986 he earned an M.A. and a Ph.D. in Near Eastern Studies from Princeton.\n\nIn 1982 he married Sally Edelstein, who was born in San Francisco and immigrated to Israel in 1981. They have three children. In an article published in \"The Atlantic\", Jeffrey Goldberg profiled Sally's acquaintance with rock stars Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jefferson Airplane. Marty Balin, one of the main songwriters of Jefferson Airplane, wrote two songs about her in the 1960s.\n\nOren's nephew is comedian Jon Rudnitsky.\n\nIn 1979, Oren began his military service in the Israel Defense Forces. He served as a paratrooper in the 1982 Lebanon War. His unit was caught in a Syrian ambush on the second day of the war. His commander was killed and nearly everyone was wounded. He then joined a unit stationed in Sidon. A day after his wedding, in the summer of 1982, Oren returned to Beirut.\n\nFollowing his regular military service, Oren volunteered to work with the Zionist underground in the Soviet Union. Sent to make contact with Zionist groups in Ukraine, he was repeatedly arrested by the KGB.\n\nDuring the Persian Gulf War he was Israeli liaison officer to the U.S. Sixth Fleet. He was called up for reserve duty for the 2005 Gaza disengagement, and participated in the evacuation of settlements. He served as an officer in the IDF Spokesman's Office during the 2006 Lebanon War. and the 2008–2009 Gaza War.\n\nIn February 2009, he delivered a lecture at Georgetown University on \"The Gaza Operation: A Personal and Historical Perspective\". \"The Today Show\" broadcast a special segment, \"The Oren Family at War.\"\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Oren taught at Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University. In 1995, during the government of Yitzhak Rabin, Oren served as an advisor in inter-religious affairs at the Ministry of Religious Affairs.\n\nIn 2006, Oren was a visiting professor at both Harvard University and Yale University, returning to Yale in 2007. Beginning in 2008, he became a visiting professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service for the 2008–09 academic year as part of the faculty associated with the Program for Jewish Civilization.\n\nPresident George W. Bush appointed Oren to serve on the honorary delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008.\n\nWhile working at a think-tank in Jerusalem, Oren publicly opposed the 2003 Iraq war, believing at the time that America \"should not get involved in state-building in a region where states are only held together by savage central power.\"\n\nOn May 3, 2009, Oren was appointed as ambassador of Israel to the United States by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, succeeding Sallai Meridor. Ambassador Oren had to give up his United States citizenship in order to assume this post.\n\nOren strongly criticized the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict report, which determined Israel was guilty of possible war crimes. In an October 2009 op-ed in \"The New Republic\", he stated, \"The Goldstone Report goes further than Ahmadinejad and the Holocaust deniers by stripping the Jews not only of the ability and the need but of the right to defend themselves.\"\n\nIn October 2009, Oren declined an invitation to attend a conference hosted by J Street, an Israel advocacy group, which has been critical of the Israel government's foreign policy. Oren called J Street \"a unique problem\" and that \"it's significantly out of the mainstream.\" However, the two have since come to a more congenial understanding, with Oren stating that \"J Street has now come and supported Congressman [Howard] Berman's Iran sanction bill; it has condemned the Goldstone Report; it has denounced the British court's decision to try Tzipi Livni for war crimes, which puts J Street much more into the mainstream.\"\n\nOren has initiated Israel outreach events for Irish Americans, Latino and LGBT leadership, and the Chinese embassy. He hosted the Israeli embassy's first Iftar dinner.\n\nOn February 8, 2010, Oren spoke at the University of California, Irvine. During his speech Oren was interrupted by 11 protesters who shouted, \"Michael Oren, propagating murder is not an expression of free speech,\" and \"How many Palestinians did you kill?\" The outburst and subsequent arrest of the protesters sparked controversy over whether the protesters were exercising free speech, as they claimed they were, or whether it was a suppression of free speech (i.e., of the right of Oren and his audience to a free exchange of ideas), as university officials claimed. On September 23, 2011, a jury convicted 10 Muslim students, 7 from UC Irvine and 3 from UC Riverside, of disrupting Oren's February 2010 speech. The charges and conviction were criticized by civil liberties advocates, as well as both Jewish and Muslim student groups.\n\nOren has lectured at universities across the United States, including Tufts University, George Washington University, Harvard University, Emory University, University of California, Davis, University of Chicago, Northeastern University, Northwestern University, Penn State, Rice University, Dickinson College, Florida International University, Columbia University, University of Maryland, American University, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California and the United States Naval Academy.\n\nFollowing the Gaza flotilla raid in May 2010, Oren wrote an op-ed in \"The New York Times\", \"An Assault, Cloaked in Peace\", in which he accused the organizers of the flotilla of attempting to \"create a provocation\" in order to \"put international pressure on Israel to drop the Gaza embargo\". He further made the claim that the \"Mavi Marmara\" was \"a vessel too large to be neutralized by technical means\".\n\nOren attempted to influence a critical 2012 CBS report by Bob Simon about Palestinian Christians in Israel, with some calling his interference an attempt to silence the American media. Oren responded that at no point had he tried to prevent the \"60 Minutes\" report, rather that he offered suggestions for balancing the segment.\n\nOn July 5, 2013, he announced that he would be leaving his post as ambassador to the United States in fall 2013. According to the Israeli daily \"Haaretz\", insiders say that Oren wanted to keep his job, but was removed because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior advisor Ron Dermer wanted the envoy post.\n\nOren has received four honorary doctorates and has delivered commencement speeches at Brandeis, Monmouth University, and Yeshiva University. In 2011, he received the Outstanding Achievers with Learning Disabilities Award from the Lab School of Washington, D.C. He delivered the keynote address at 2012 Equality Forum on LGBT rights in Israel.\n\nOren has written many articles commenting on current political issues. Before assuming his diplomatic post, he published frequently in the \"New York Times\", the \"Wall Street Journal\", and \"The New Republic\", where he was a contributing editor. He appeared on \"Charlie Rose\", \"The Daily Show\", the \"Today Show\", and he \"John Batchelor Show\". As ambassador, he has published nearly forty op-eds and has given dozens of television interviews, including Bill Maher, \"Colbert Report\", \"The View\", and \"The Situation Room\" with Wolf Blitzer.\n\nHis two full-length articles \"Israel: The Ultimate Ally\" and \"Israel's Resilient Democracy\", were published in \"Foreign Policy\" magazine.\n\nIn July 2014 Oren argued against a ceasefire and for the continuation of the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, calling on the international community to leave Israel alone to defang and deprive Hamas of its heavy arms and make it pay a \"prohibitive cost.\"\n\nOn June 15, 2015 Oren gave a speech at the Leonardo Hotel in Jerusalem, in which he said that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement poses a \"strategic threat\" to Israel, which needs to fight it \"like a war, which it is\". He also warned that the U.S. is gambling with Israel's future over Iran, saying that the U.S. \"can afford to make a mistake\" with them, while \"Israel has zero room for error\", adding: \"The United States has the most powerful army in all of history, they're thousands of miles away from Iran, and they don't feel any direct threat. Israel is in Iran's backyard, and faces a clear and direct threat from Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas. The IDF is a strong military force, but does not have the capacity and magnitude the US Army has to deter aggression.\"\n\nAlso during June 2015, an op-ed piece by Oren published in the \"Wall Street Journal\" claimed that Barack Obama had deliberately sabotaged US-Israeli relations, resulting in Kulanu leader Moshe Kahlon distancing himself and the party from Oren's stated views. Shortly afterwards another article by Oren was published by \"Foreign Policy\", which argued that Obama's outreach to the Muslim world as highlighted by his Cairo speech was partly rooted in \"abandonment\" by his father and stepfather. Oren was criticised by Abe Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, who said that Oren's theorising \"veers into the realm of conspiracy theories... with an element of amateur psychoanalysis\", and characterised the \"Foreign Policy\" article as \"borderline stereotyping\".\n\nIn 2015, Oren published \"Ally: My Journey Across the American-Israeli Divide\" (June 2015), which aimed to describe the recent state of Israel–US relations. The book has received both praise and criticism, including a negative review by Philip Gordon, the White House's \"point man\" for the Middle East during Oren's time as ambassador, titled \"Bibi's man in D.C., still spinning for the boss.\" In response to its controversial reception, Oren stated: \"So far a lot of things have been said about me. ... I obviously touched a nerve.\" Noah Efron wrote in \"Haaretz\" that the book, which continued the self-professed \"armchair psychoanalyzing\" of the U.S. President, \"meshes snugly with the racist fantasies of rabid right-wing bloggers and so-called birthers who see in Barack Obama’s African father and Indonesian stepfather indications that he is not a real American.\" Efron also chided Oren for failing to assign any responsibility to Israeli for the decline in US-Israel relations, calling the book \"profoundly un-Zionist.\"\n\n\"Power, Faith and Fantasy\", a history of American involvement in the Middle East, was published by Norton and quickly became a \"New York Times\" bestseller. \"Power, Faith and Fantasy\" earned positive reviews from \"Newsweek\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The New York Times Book Review\", the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", and the \"Willamette Week\".\n\nOren's \"Six Days of War\" is an historical account of the events of the Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors. The book was widely praised by critics and won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for History and the National Jewish Book Award. It spent seven weeks on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list. \"The New York Times Book Review\" wrote positively of \"Six Days of War\", as did the \"Washington Post\", which called it \"not only the best book so far written on the Six Day War, it is likely to remain the best\". Oren's Ph.D. thesis, \"The Origins of the Second Arab-Israel War: Israel, Egypt, and the Great Powers, 1952-1956,\" was published in 1992.\n\nOren has written two works of fiction. \"Sand Devil\", published in 2000, is a trilogy of novellas set in the Negev desert. \"Reunion\", based on his father's stories from World War II, appeared in 2004.\n\nOren was given the fourth spot on the list of the new Kulanu party before Israel's 2015 elections, adding foreign policy credentials to a party that campaigned almost exclusively on economic issues. He was elected and, on March 31, sworn in as a Member of Israel's 20th Knesset, serving on its Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. On August 1, 2016, it was announced that Oren would be appointed as deputy minister in charge of public diplomacy.\n\nOren supported the creation of a new Israeli national holiday, Yom HaAliyah (, \"Aliyah Day\") to be celebrated annually on the tenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan (). On 21 June 2016 the Knesset voted in favor of adding Yom HaAliyah to the national calendar. The Yom HaAliyah bill was co-sponsored by Knesset members from different parties in a rare instance of cooperation across the political spectrum. The day chosen for Yom HaAliyah is, according to the biblical narrative, the day Joshua and the Israelites crossed the Jordan River at Gilgal into the Promised Land. It was thus the first documented \"mass Aliyah\".\n\n\n\n"}

The ship was then cannibalized for spare parts in the Philippines.\n\nUSS \"Sutton\" was named in honor of Ensign Shelton B. Sutton, Jr. (1919-1942), who was killed on 13 November 1942 when the light cruiser was torpedoed and sunk during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. She was laid down on 23 August 1943 by the Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida; launched on 6 August 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Shelton B. Sutton, Sr.; and commissioned on 22 December 1944, Lt. T. W.

While this was enough to create a media sensation, it was decades later before the U.S. government revealed that the submarine also carried a load of uranium oxide produced by the German atomic weapons program bound for a last-ditch Japanese effort.

{"id": "2255706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255706", "title": "Myriophyllum aquaticum", "text": "Myriophyllum aquaticum\n\nMyriophyllum aquaticum is a flowering plant, a vascular dicot, commonly called parrot's-feather and parrot feather watermilfoil.\n\nParrot feather is a perennial plant. Parrot feather gets its name from its feather-like leaves that are arranged around the stem in whorls of four to six. The emergent stems and leaves are the most distinctive trait of parrot feather, as they can grow up to a foot above the water surface and look almost like small fir trees. The woody emergent stems grow over 5 feet long and will extend to the bank and shore. Attached to the Parrot feather are pinkish-white flowers that extend approximately 1/16 inches long. As the water warms in the spring, parrot feather begins to flourish. Most plants flower in the spring; however, some also flower in the fall. Almost all plants of this species are female, in fact there are no male plants found outside of South America. Seeds are not produced in any North American plants. Parrot feather reproduces asexually. New plants grow from fragments of already rooted plants. The plant has whorls of feathery blue-green to waxy gray-green leaves deeply cut into many narrow lobes.\n\nKasselmann recently described a new variety, \"M. aquaticum\" var. \"santacatarinense\", which distinguishes itself from the typical variety by its more stiff and robust habitus and pinnae that are fewer and broader.\n\nParrot feather is native to the Amazon River in South America, but it can now be found on every continent except Antarctica. It is thought that this plant was introduced to North America around the late 1800s. It was first discovered in the United States in the 1890s in Washington D.C. Parrot’s feather typically grows in freshwater streams, ponds, lakes, rivers, and canals that have a high nutrient content. During the 20th century it colonized areas in South Africa, Japan, England, New Zealand, and Australia. As it prefers a warmer climate, it is chiefly found in the southern parts of the United States.\n\nParrot feather is now used for indoor and outdoor aquatic use. It is a popular plant in aquatic gardens. It spreads easily and has become an invasive species and a noxious weed in many areas. The plant can be introduced to new areas when sections of its rhizome are dug up and moved. In Florida in the United States, flea beetles have been found to use parrot feather as a host for their larvae.\n\nBecause of its attractiveness and ease of cultivation, parrot feather has been introduced worldwide for use in indoor and outdoor aquaria. It is also a popular aquatic garden plant. However, it has escaped cultivation and spread via plant fragments and intentional plantings. While parrot feather may provide cover for some aquatic organisms, it can seriously change the physical and chemical characteristics of lakes and streams. The parrot feather grows abundantly, shades out naturally occurring algae, and clogs irrigation ducts and canals. The Parrot feather typically exist in bundles and extend out of the water. In large numbers, the plants make a dense mat on the water's surface. Because of this, they shade the water from sunlight and cause native plants to die because of light deficiency. The organisms that feed on the native plants can die off due to starvation. The dense mats also cause problems for recreation. Swimmers and boat propellors can become entangled. The mats are also a breeding ground for mosquitos.\n\nHerbicides have not been found very useful in controlling its growth, partly because the plant has a waxy cuticle that seals out the poison. Cutting and chopping can actually promote the plant's spread. In the U.S. states of Alabama, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, and Washington, parrot feather is a declared noxious weed and is therefore banned from sale.\n\nThe two main solutions to manage this aquatic nuisance is physically removing the plant and or using herbicides.\n\nThe physical aspects of removal are such acts of cutting, harvesting, and rotovation (underwater rototilling). These methods see best results only when the extent of the infestation has taken over all available niches. Best results are seen this way due to the availability of space as compared to rapid growth. Using physical control methods while the plant is still invading will tend to enhance its rate of spread.\n\nAnother method of controlling Parrots feather is by the usage of herbicides. The herbicides are effective to the plant part exposed above water. The plant parts beneath the water never come fully into contact with the pesticides and are therefore washed away. Herbicides are most effective when applied to young growing plants. They should be applied repeatedly to show maximum results. M. aquaticum is more difficult to control with herbicides than other aquatic species. The leaves are protected by a thick waxy coating, and in order for herbicides to penetrate the leaves, surfactants must be added; however, herbicides may impact non-target native plants or animals.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, this plant is one of five introduced aquatic plants which are to be banned from sale from April 2014. This is the first ban of its kind in the country.\n\n"}

Initially, they tried to launch the project as a television idea set in the themed time of the 1960s. As the group experienced difficulties getting the television show off the ground, they diverted their attentions towards simply creating music. They decided to name the group The Teen Queens, and from 1992 to 1993 the group released three top ten ARIA singles.\n\nAfter the group split in 1993, Crawford continued to act in television and movies, and appear in commercials for companies such as Pizza Hut.\n\nCrawford was originally cast as Tracy Russell in Australia's long-running sitcom \"Hey Dad..!\", but was replaced by Belinda Emmett.\n\nCrawford's next breakthrough came in 1998 when she was enlisted to join the new children's band and television show \"Hi-5\" as the group's oldest and most commercially experienced member.

{"id": "2255715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255715", "title": "History of the Jews in Iraq", "text": "History of the Jews in Iraq\n\nThe history of the Jews in Iraq (, ', Yehudim Bavlim, ') is documented from the time of the Babylonian captivity c. 586 BC. Iraqi Jews constitute one of the world's oldest and most historically significant Jewish communities.\n\nThe Jewish community of what is termed in Jewish sources \"Babylon\" or \"Babylonia\" included Ezra the scribe, whose return to Judea in the late 6th century BC is associated with significant changes in Jewish ritual observance and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. The Babylonian Talmud was compiled in \"Babylonia\", identified with modern Iraq.\n\nFrom the biblical Babylonian period to the rise of the Islamic caliphate, the Jewish community of \"Babylon\" thrived as the center of Jewish learning. The Mongol invasion and Islamic discrimination in the Middle Ages led to its decline. Under the Ottoman Empire, the Jews of Iraq fared better. The community established modern schools in the second half of the 19th century. Driven by persecution, which saw many of the leading Jewish families of Baghdad flee for India, and expanding trade with British colonies, the Jews of Iraq established a trading diaspora in Asia known as the Baghdadi Jews.\n\nIn the 20th century, Iraqi Jews played an important role in the early days of Iraq's independence. Between 1950 and 1952, 120,000–130,000 of the Iraqi Jewish community (around 75%) reached Israel in Operation Ezra and Nehemiah.\n\nThe religious and cultural traditions of Iraqi Jews are kept alive today in strong communities established by Iraqi Jews in Israel, especially in Or Yehuda, Givatayim and Kiryat Gat. According to government data as of 2014, there were 227,900 Jews of Iraqi descent in Israel, with other estimates as high as 600,000 Israelis having some Iraqi ancestry. Smaller communities upholding Iraqi Jewish traditions in the Jewish diaspora exist in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Singapore, Canada, and the United States.\n\nWhat Jewish sources called \"Babylon\" and \"Babylonia\" may refer to the ancient city of Babylon and the Neo-Babylonian Empire; or, very often, it means the specific area of Mesopotamia (the region between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers) where a number of Jewish religious academies functioned during the Geonic period (6th–11th century CE).\n\nIn the Bible, Babylon and the country of Babylonia are not always clearly distinguished, in most cases the same word being used for both. In some passages the land of Babylonia is called Shinar, while in the post-exilic literature it is called Chaldea. In the Book of Genesis, Babylonia is described as the land in which Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh are located – cities that are declared to have formed the beginning of Nimrod's kingdom (). Here, the Tower of Babel was located (); and it was also the seat of Amraphel's dominion ().\n\nIn the historical books Babylonia is frequently referred to (there are no fewer than thirty-one allusions in the Books of Kings), though the lack of a clear distinction between the city and the country is sometimes puzzling. Allusions to it are confined to the points of contact between the Israelites and the various Babylonian kings, especially Merodach-baladan (Berodach-baladan of ; compare ) and Nebuchadnezzar. In Books of Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah the interest is transferred to Cyrus (see, for example, ), though the retrospect still deals with the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar, and Artaxerxes is mentioned once ().\n\nIn the poetical literature of Israel, Babylonia plays an insignificant part (see , and especially Psalm 137), but it fills a very large place in the Prophets. The Book of Isaiah resounds with the \"burden of Babylon\" (), though at that time it still seemed a \"far country\" (). In the number and importance of its references to Babylonian life and history, the Book of Jeremiah stands preeminent in the Hebrew literature. With numerous important allusions to events in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Jeremiah has become a valuable source in reconstructing Babylonian history within recent times. The inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar are almost exclusively devoted to building operations; and but for the Book of Jeremiah, little would be known of his campaign against Jerusalem.\n\nThree times during the 6th century BCE, the Jews of the ancient Kingdom of Judah were exiled to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. These three separate occasions are mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah (). The first was in the time of Jehoiachin in 597 BC, when, in retaliation for a refusal to pay tribute, the Temple of Jerusalem was partially despoiled and a number of the leading citizens removed (Book of Daniel, ). After eleven years, in the reign of Zedekiah—who had been enthroned by Nebuchadnezzar—a fresh revolt of the Judaeans took place, perhaps encouraged by the close proximity of the Egyptian army. The city was razed to the ground, and a further deportation ensued. Finally, five years later, Jeremiah records a third captivity. After the overthrow of Babylonia by the Persians, Cyrus gave the Jews permission to return to their native land (537 BC), and more than forty thousand are said to have availed themselves of the privilege. (See Jehoiakim; Ezra; Nehemiah.)\n\nThe earliest accounts of the Jews exiled to Babylonia are furnished only by scanty biblical details; certain sources seek to supply this deficiency from the realms of legend and tradition. Thus, the so-called \"Small Chronicle\" (Seder Olam Zutta) endeavors to preserve historic continuity by providing a genealogy of the exilarchs (\"Reshe Galuta\") back to King Jeconiah; indeed, Jeconiah himself is made an exilarch. The \"Small Chronicle's\" statement, that Zerubbabel returned to Judea in the Greek period, can of course not be regarded as historical. Certainly, the descendants of the Davidic line occupied an exalted position among their brethren in Babylonia, as they did at that period in Judea. During the Maccabean revolt, these Judean descendants of the royal house had immigrated to Babylonia.\n\nWith Alexander the Great's campaign, accurate information concerning the Jews in the East reached the western world. Alexander's army contained numerous Jews who refused, from religious scruples, to take part in the reconstruction of the destroyed Belus temple in Babylon. The accession of Seleucus Nicator, 312 BC, to whose extensive empire Babylonia belonged, was accepted by the Jews and Syrians for many centuries as the commencement of a new era for reckoning time, called \"minyan sheṭarot\", æra contractuum, or era of contracts, which was also officially adopted by the Parthians. This so-called Seleucid era survived in the Orient long after it had been abolished in the West (see Sherira's \"Letter,\" ed. Neubauer, p. 28). Nicator's foundation of a city, Seleucia, on the Tigris is mentioned by the Rabbis (Midr. The. ix. 8); both the \"Large\" and the \"Small Chronicle\" contain references to him. The important victory which the Jews are said to have gained over the Galatians in Babylonia (see II Maccabees - ) must have happened under Seleucus Callinicus or under Antiochus III. The last-named settled a large number of Babylonian Jews as colonists in his western dominions, with the view of checking certain revolutionary tendencies disturbing those lands. Mithridates (174–136 BC) subjugated, about the year 160, the province of Babylonia, and thus the Jews for four centuries came under Parthian domination.\n\nJewish sources contain no mention of Parthian influence; the very name \"Parthian\" does not occur, unless indeed \"Parthian\" is meant by \"Persian\", which occurs now and then. The Armenian prince Sanatroces, of the royal house of the Arsacides, is mentioned in the \"Small Chronicle\" as one of the successors (diadochoi) of Alexander. Among other Asiatic princes, the Roman rescript in favor of the Jews reached Arsaces as well (I Macc. xv. 22); it is not, however, specified which Arsaces. Not long after this, the Partho-Babylonian country was trodden by the army of a Jewish prince; the Syrian king, Antiochus VII Sidetes, marched, in company with Hyrcanus I, against the Parthians; and when the allied armies defeated the Parthians (129 BC) at the Great Zab (Lycus), the king ordered a halt of two days on account of the Jewish Sabbath and Feast of Weeks. In 40 BC. the Jewish puppet-king, Hyrcanus II, fell into the hands of the Parthians, who, according to their custom, cut off his ears in order to render him unfit for rulership. The Jews of Babylonia, it seems, had the intention of founding a high-priesthood for the exiled Hyrcanus, which they would have made quite independent of Judea. But the reverse was to come about: the Judeans received a Babylonian, Ananel by name, as their high priest which indicates the importance enjoyed by the Jews of Babylonia. Still in religious matters the Babylonians, as indeed the whole diaspora, were in many regards dependent upon Judea. They went on pilgrimages to Jerusalem for the festivals.\n\nHow free a hand the Parthians permitted the Jews is perhaps best illustrated by the rise of the little Jewish robber-state in Nehardea (see Anilai and Asinai). Still more remarkable is the conversion of the king of Adiabene to Judaism. These instances show not only the tolerance, but the weakness of the Parthian kings. The Babylonian Jews wanted to fight in common cause with their Judean brethren against Vespasian; but it was not until the Romans waged war under Trajan against Parthia that they made their hatred felt; so that it was in a great measure owing to the revolt of the Babylonian Jews that the Romans did not become masters of Babylonia too. Philo speaks of the large number of Jews resident in that country, a population which was no doubt considerably swelled by new immigrants after the destruction of Jerusalem. Accustomed in Jerusalem from early times to look to the east for help, and aware, as the Roman procurator Petronius was, that the Jews of Babylon could render effectual assistance, Babylonia became with the fall of Jerusalem the very bulwark of Judaism. The collapse of the Bar Kochba revolt no doubt added to the number of Jewish refugees in Babylon.\n\nIn the continuous Roman–Persian Wars, the Jews had every reason to hate the Romans, the destroyers of their sanctuary, and to side with the Parthians, their protectors. Possibly it was recognition of services thus rendered by the Jews of Babylonia, and by the Davidic house especially, that induced the Parthian kings to elevate the princes of the Exile, who until then had been little more than mere collectors of revenue, to the dignity of real princes, called \"Resh Galuta\". Thus, then, the numerous Jewish subjects were provided with a central authority which assured an undisturbed development of their own internal affairs.\n\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem, Babylon would become the focus of Judaism for more than a thousand years, and the place where Jews would acclimate themselves as a people without a land. More than 2,500 years ago, after the destruction of the Jewish temple of Judea, Jews were originally brought to the region between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, also known as Mesopotamia. Some five centuries later, after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, there was a wide dispersion of Jews in which many ended up in Babylonia. The Jews of Babylon would for the first time write prayers in a language other than Hebrew, such as the Kaddish, written in Judeo-Aramaic – a harbinger of the many languages in which Jewish prayers in the diaspora would come to be written in, such as Greek, Arabic, and Turkish.\n\nBabylon would therefore become the center of Jewish religion and culture in exile. Many esteemed and influential Jewish scholars dating back to Amoraim have their roots in Babylonian Jewry and culture.\n\nThe Iraqi Jewish community formed a homogeneous group, maintaining communal Jewish identity, culture and traditions. The Jews in Iraq distinguished themselves by the way they spoke in their old Arabic dialect, Judeo-Arabic; the way they dressed; observation of Jewish rituals, for example, the Sabbath and holidays; and kashrut.\n\nThe rabbi Abba Arika (175–247 AD), known as \"Rab\" due to his status as the highest authority in Judaism, is considered by the Jewish oral tradition the key leader, who along with the whole people in diaspora, maintained Judaism after the destruction of Jerusalem. After studying in Palestine at the academy of Judah I, Rab returned to his Babylonian home; his arrival, in the year 530 of the Seleucidan, or 219 of the common era, is considered to mark the beginning of a new era for the Jewish people, initiating the dominant role that the Babylonian academies played for several centuries, for the first time outmoding Judea and Galilee in the quality of Torah study. Most Jews to this day rely on the quality of the work of Babylon during this period over that of the Galilee from the same period. The Jewish community of Babylon was already learned – Rab just focused and organised their study. Leaving an existing Babylonian academy at Nehardea for his colleague Samuel, Rab founded a new academy at Sura, where he and his family already owned property, and which was known as a Jewish city. Rab's move created an environment in which Babylon had two contemporary leading academies that competed with one another, yet were so far removed from one another that they could never interfere with each other's operations. Since Rab and Samuel were acknowledged peers in position and learning, their academies likewise were accounted of equal rank and influence. Their relationship can be compared to that between the Jerusalemite academies of the House of Hillel Ha-Zaken and the House of Shammai, albeit Rab and Samuel agreed far more often than did the houses of Hillel and Shammai, who nearly never agreed on the Law. Thus both Babylonian rabbinical schools opened this new era for diaspora Judaism well, and the ensuing discussions in their classes furnished the earliest stratum and style of the scholarly material deposited in the Babylonian Talmud. The coexistence for many decades of these two colleges of equal rank, even after the school at Nehardea was moved to Pumbedita (now Fallujah), produced for the first time in Babylonia the phenomenon of dual leadership that, with some slight interruptions, became a permanent fixture and a weighty factor in the development of the Jewish faith as we know it today.\n\nThe key work of these semi-competing academies was the compilation of the Babylonian Talmud (the discussions from these two cities), completed by Rav Ashi and Ravina, two successive leaders of the Babylonian Jewish community, around the year 520, though rougher copies had already been circulated to the Jews of the Byzantine Empire. Editorial work by the Savoraim or \"Rabbanan Savoraei\" (post-Talmudic rabbis), continued on this text's grammar for the next 250 years; much of the text did not reach its \"perfected\" form until around 600–700 AD. The Mishnah, which had been completed in the early 3rd century AD, and the Babylonian Gemara (the discussions at and around these academies) together form the \"Talmud Bavli\" (the \"Babylonian Talmud\"). The Babylonian Jews became the keepers of the Bible. Jewish culture flourished in Babylonia during the Sasanian Empire (331–638) and embarks a rise of Rabbinic Judaism and central texts. Jewish scholars compiled the Babylonian Talmud starting in 474 as the spiritual codex of Judaism, transferring Judaism into a spiritual and moral movement. The Talmud, a central commentary on the Mishnah, was perceived as a \"portable homeland\" for the Jews in diaspora.\n\nThe three centuries in the course of which the Babylonian Talmud was developed in the academies founded by Rab and Samuel were followed by five centuries during which it was intensely preserved, studied, expounded in the schools, and, through their influence, discipline and work, recognized by the whole diaspora. Sura, Nehardea, and Pumbedita were considered the seats of diaspora learning; and the heads of these authorities were referred to later on as \"Geonim\" and were considered the highest authorities on religious matters in the Jewish world. Their decisions were sought from all sides and were accepted wherever diaspora Jewish communal life existed. They even successfully competed against the learning coming from the Land of Israel itself. In the words of the haggadist, \"God created these two academies in order that the promise might be fulfilled, that 'the word of God should never depart from Israel's mouth (Isa. lix. 21). The periods of Jewish history immediately following the close of the Talmud are designated according to the titles of the teachers at Sura and Pumbedita; thus we have the time of the Geonim and that of the Saboraim. The Saboraim were the scholars whose diligent hands completed the Talmud and the first great Talmudic commentaries in the first third of the 6th century. The two academies among others, and the Jewish community they led, lasted until the middle of the 11th century, Pumbedita faded after its chief rabbi was murdered in 1038, and Sura faded soon after. Which ended for centuries the great scholarly reputation given to Babylonian Jews, as the center of Jewish thought.\n\nIraq's Jewish community reached an apex in the 12th century, with 40,000 Jews, 28 synagogues, and ten \"yeshivot\", or Rabbinic academies. Jews participated in commerce, artisanal labor and medicine. Under Mongol rule (1258–1335) Jewish physician Sa’ad Al-Dawla served as , or assistant director of the financial administration of Baghdad, as well as Chief Vizier of the Mongol Empire.\n\nDuring Ottoman rule (1534–1917) Jewish life prospered in Babylon. Jews were afforded religious liberties, enabling them to administer their own affairs in Jewish education. Tolerance towards Jews and Jewish customs, however, depended on local rulers. Ottoman ruler Sultan Murad IV appointed 10,000 Jewish officers in his government, as he valued the Baghdadi Jews. Unlike Murad IV, his governor Dauod Pasha was cruel and would be responsible for the emigration of many Iraqi Jews. After Dauod's death in 1851, Jewish involvement commerce and politics improved, with religious influence also transforming. The Jewish Iraqi community introduced the \"Hakham Bashi\", or Chief Rabbinate, in 1849, with Hakham Ezra Dangoor leading the community. The chief rabbi was also president of the community and was assisted by a lay council, a religious court, and a schools committee.\n\nThe Persian people were now again to make their influence felt in the history of the world. Ardashir I destroyed the rule of the Arsacids in the winter of 226, and founded the illustrious dynasty of the Sassanids. Different from the Parthian rulers, who were northern Iranians following Mithraism and Zoroastrianism and speaking Pahlavi dialect, the Sassanids intensified nationalism and established a state-sponsored Zoroastrian church which often suppressed dissident factions and heterodox views. Under the Sassanids, Babylonia became the province of Asuristan, with its main city, Ctesiphon, becoming the capital of the Sassanid Empire.\n\nShapur I (Shvor Malka, which is the Aramaic form of the name) was a friend to the Jews. His friendship with Shmuel gained many advantages for the Jewish community.\n\nShapur II's mother was Jewish, and this gave the Jewish community a relative freedom of religion and many advantages. Shapur was also the friend of a Babylonian rabbi in the Talmud called Raba, and Raba's friendship with Shapur II enabled him to secure a relaxation of the oppressive laws enacted against the Jews in the Persian Empire. In addition, Raba sometimes referred to his top student Abaye with the term Shvur Malka meaning \"Shapur [the] King\" because of his bright and quick intellect.\n\nChristians, Manicheans, Buddhists and Jews at first seemed at a disadvantage, especially under Sassanian high-priest Kartir; but the Jews, dwelling in more compact masses in cities like Isfahan, were not exposed to such general discrimination as broke out against the more isolated Christians.\n\nThe first legal expression of Islam toward the Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians after the conquests of the 630s were the poll-tax (\"jizyah\"), the tax upon real estate (\"kharaj\") was instituted. The first caliph, Abu Bakr, sent the famous warrior Khalid bin Al-Waleed against Iraq; and a Jew, by name Ka'ab al-Aḥbar, is said to have fortified the general with prophecies of success.\n\nThe Jews may have favored the advance of the Arabs, from whom they could expect mild treatment. Some such services it must have been that secured for the exilarch Bostanai the favor of Umar I, who awarded to him for a wife the daughter of the conquered Sassanid Chosroes II as Theophanes and Abraham Zacuto narrate. Jewish records, as, for instance, \"Seder ha-Dorot,\" contain a Bostanai legend which has many features in common with the account of the hero Mar Zutra II, already mentioned. The account, at all events, reveals that Bostanai, the founder of the succeeding exilarch dynasty, was a man of prominence, who received from the victorious Arab general certain high privileges, such as the right to wear a signet ring, a privilege otherwise limited to Muslims.\n\nOmar and Othman were followed by Ali (656), with whom the Jews of Babylonia sided as against his rival Mu'awiyah. A Jewish preacher, Abdallah ibn Saba, of southern Arabia, who had embraced Islam, held forth in support of his new religion, expounded Mohammed's appearance in a Jewish sense. Ali made Kufa, in Iraq, his capital, and it was there that Jews expelled from the Arabian Peninsula went (about 641). It is perhaps owing to these immigrants that the Arabic language so rapidly gained ground among the Jews of Babylonia, although a greater portion of the population of Iraq were of Arab descent. The capture by Ali of Firuz Shabur, where 90,000 Jews are said to have dwelt, is mentioned by the Jewish chroniclers. Mar Isaac, chief of the Academy of Sura, paid homage to the caliph, and received privileges from him.\n\nThe proximity of the court lent to the Jews of Babylonia a species of central position, as compared with the whole caliphate; so that Babylonia still continued to be the focus of Jewish life. The time-honored institutions of the exilarchate and the gaonate—the heads of the academies attained great influence—constituted a kind of higher authority, voluntarily recognized by the whole Jewish diaspora. But unfortunately exilarchs and geonim only too soon began to rival each other. A certain Mar Yanḳa, closely allied to the exilarch, persecuted the rabbis of Pumbedita so bitterly that several of them were compelled to flee to Sura, not to return until after their persecutor's death (about 730). \"The exilarchate was for sale in the Arab period\" (Ibn Daud); and centuries later, Sherira boasts that he was not descended from Bostanai. In Arabic legend, the resh galuta (ras al-galut) remained a highly important personage; one of them could see spirits; another is said to have been put to death under the last Umayyad caliph, Merwan ibn Mohammed (745–750).\n\nThe Umayyad caliph, Umar II. (717–720), persecuted the Jews. He issued orders to his governors: \"Tear down no church, synagogue, or fire-temple; but permit no new ones to be built\". Isaac Iskawi II (about 800) received from Harun al-Rashid (786–809) confirmation of the right to carry a seal of office. At the court of the mighty Harun appeared an embassy from the emperor Charlemagne, in which a Jew, Isaac, took part. Charles (possibly Charles the Bald) is said to have asked the \"king of Babel\" to send him a man of royal lineage; and in response the calif dispatched Rabbi Machir to him; this was the first step toward establishing communication between the Jews of Babylonia and European communities. Although it is said that the law requiring Jews to wear a yellow badge upon their clothing originated with Harun, and although the laws of Islam were stringently enforced by him to the detriment of the Jews, the magnificent development which Arabian culture underwent in his time must have benefited the Jews also; so that a scientific tendency began to make itself noticeable among the Babylonian Jews under Harun and his successors, especially under Al-Ma'mun (813–833).\n\nLike the Arabs, the Jews were zealous promoters of knowledge, and by translating Greek and Latin authors, mainly at the House of Wisdom in Bagdad, contributed essentially to their preservation. They took up religio-philosophical studies (the \"kalam\"), siding generally with the Mutazilites and maintaining the freedom of the human will (\"chadr\"). The government meanwhile accomplished all it could toward the complete humiliation of the Jews. All non-believers—Magi, Jews, and Christians—were compelled by Al-Mutawakkil to wear a badge; their places of worship were confiscated and turned into mosques; they were excluded from public offices, and compelled to pay to the caliph a tax of one-tenth of the value of their houses. The caliph Al-Mu'tadhel (892–902) ranked the Jews as \"state servants.\"\n\nThe Caliphate hastened to its end before the rising power of the Mongol Empire. As Bar Hebræus remarks, these Mongol tribes knew no distinction between heathens, Jews, and Christians; and their Great Khan Kublai Khan showed himself just toward the Jews who served in his army, as reported by Marco Polo.\n\nHulagu (a Buddhist), the destroyer of the Caliphate (1258) and the conqueror of Palestine (1260), was tolerant toward Muslims, Jews and Christians; but there can be no doubt that in those days of terrible warfare the Jews must have suffered much with others. Under the Mongolian rulers, the priests of all religions were exempt from the poll-tax. Hulagu's second son, Aḥmed, embraced Islam, but his successor, Arghun (1284–91), hated the Muslims and was friendly to Jews and Christians; his chief counselor was a Jew, Sa'ad al-Dawla, a physician of Baghdad.\n\nIt proved a false dawn. The power of Sa’ad al-Dawla was so vexatious to the Muslim population the churchman Bar Hebraeus wrote so “were the Muslims reduced to having a Jew in the place of honor.” This was exacerbated by Sa’d al-Dawla, who ordered no Muslim be employed by the official bureaucracy. He was also known as a fearsome tax collection and rumours swirled he was planning to create a new religion of which Arghun was supposed to be the prophet. Sa’d al-Dawla was murdered two days before the death of his Arghun, then stricken by illness, by his enemies in court.\n\nAfter the death of the great khan and the murder of his Jewish favorite, the Muslims fell upon the Jews, and Baghdad witnessed a regular battle between them. Gaykhatu also had a Jewish minister of finance, Reshid al-Dawla. The khan Ghazan also became a Muslim, and made the Jews second class citizens. The Egyptian sultan Naṣr, who also ruled over Iraq, reestablished the same law in 1330, and saddled it with new limitations. During this period attacks on Jews greatly increased. The situation grew dire for the Jewish community as Muslim chronicler Abbas al-’Azzawi recorded:\n\n“These events which befell the Jews after they had attained a high standing in the state caused them to lower their voices. [Since then] we have not heard from them anything worthy of recording because they were prevented from participation in its government and politics. They were neglected and their voice was only heard [again] after a long time.”\n\nBaghdad, reduced in importance, ravaged by wars and invasions, was eclipsed as the commercial and political centre of the Arab world. The Jewish community, shuttered out of political life, were reduced too and the status of the Exhilarch and the Rabbis of the city diminished. Great numbers of Jews began to depart, seeking tranquility elsewhere in the Middle East beyond a now troubled frontier.\n\nMongolian fury once again devastated the localities inhabited by Jews, when, in 1393, Timur captured Baghdad, Wasit, Hilla, Basra, and Tikrit, after obstinate resistance. Many Jews who had fled to Baghdad were slaughtered. Others escaped the city to Kurdistan and Syria. Many were not so fortunate, with one report mentioning 10,000 Jews killed in Mosul, Basra, and Husun Kifa.\n\nThe ruins of Baghdad after Timur's conquests was described in 1437 by the Muslim chronicler Al-Maqrizi: “Baghdad is in ruins. It has no mosque, no congregation of believers, no call to prayer and no markets. Most of the date palms have withered. Most of the irrigation canals are blocked. It cannot be called a city.”\n\nAfter the death of Timur, the region fell into the hands of marauding Turkmen tribesmen who were unable to establish a government of any kind. Ravaged by conquest, Iraq fell into lawlessness and became close to uninhabitable. Roads became dangerous and irrigation systems collapsed, seeing precious farmland in the delta region sink below water. Rapacious Bedouin filled the vacuum, rendering the caravan trade all but impossible. Denied authority of any kind and severed from its historic trading ties with the Middle East and the Far East, the ancient city of Baghdad had become a minor town.\n\nThe cumulative effect of the Mongol rampage and the social collapse that followed was that of the pre-existing Jewish community of Baghdad either died or fled. Jewish life entered a Dark Age. According to historian Zvi Yehuda, the fifteenth century sees no reports on Jews in Baghdad or in its surroundings, in Basra, Hilla, Kifil, ‘Ana, Kurdistan, even in Persia and the Persian Gulf. The organized Jewish community of Iraq appears to have disappeared in this period for more than four generations. This is behind the discontinuity between the present traditions of Iraqi Jewry and the Babylonian traditions of Talmudic or Geonic times. It remains the case that most Jewish Iraqis are of indigenous Middle Eastern ancestry rather than migrants from Spain, as in the case of North Africa and the Levant.\n\nAfter various changes of fortune, Mesopotamia and Iraq came into the hands of the Ottoman Turks, when Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in 1534 took Tabriz and Baghdad from the Persians, leading to an improvement in the life of the Jews. The Persian reconquest in 1623 during the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39) led to a much worse situation, so that the re-conquest of Iraq by the Turks in 1638 included an army with a large population of Jews. Some sources say they made up 10% of the army. The day of the reconquest was even given a holiday, \"Yom Nes\" (day of miracle).\n\nThis period of Mameluk rule in Iraq, under the aegis of the Ottoman Empire, united most of the future territory of Iraq into a single unit for the first time. As it ceased to be a warring frontier, opportunities for trade increased, especially due to the growing European presence on the ocean routes to India. Following this uptick in trade and security, Jewish communities began to be reestablished in Baghdad and Basra.\n\nThis was not the revival of a community so much as the establishment of a new one. According to the historian Zvi Yehuda, an analysis of the tens of thousands of Iraqi Jewish family trees stored at the Babylonian Jewry Heritage Center have indicate that families of Baghdadi Jews do not possess family trees tracing their lineage prior to the end of the 17th century. They were migrants from smaller Mesopotamian communities and from across the Middle East. Yehuda calls the Jewish community that reestabaliahed itself in Baghdad, Basra and other cities the “new Babylonian Diaspora.”\n\nIn 1743 there was a plague in which many of the Jews of Baghdad, including all the rabbis, died. The remaining Baghdad community asked the community of Aleppo to send them a new Chief Rabbi, leading to the appointment of Rabbi Sadka Bekhor Hussein. Culturally, it would prove a decisive moment when Chief Rabbi Shmuel Laniyado of Aleppo picked his protege for Baghdad. It is said he was accompanied by fifty Sephardic families from Aleppo. Many of them were Rabbis who were to sit on the Beth Din of Baghdad and Basra.\n\nThis led to an assimilation of Iraqi Judaism to the general Sephardic mode of observance. Jewish culture revived, with communal leaders as Solomon Ma’tuk being renown for his work as an astronomer, library and piyyutim. This brought the leading Jewish families of Baghdad, and with it, their Jewish practice into the network of Sephardic scribes and later printing presses established in Aleppo, Livorno and Salonica. Surviving records of the contents of the library of Solomon Ma’tuk shows a great number of books purchased from Sephardic scribes and some even originally from Spain.\n\nFurther driving this process was the high esteem in which Rabbi Sadka Bekhor Hussein was held as a halakhic authority. This saw him accepted as a halakhic authority by the Jews of Persia, Kurdistan and the fledgling Baghdadi trading outposts being established in India. Sephardic Rabbis and their rulings and practices were held in higher esteem. The historian Zvi Yehuda says the period saw the wheels turn in the relationship between the Babylonian Jewish communities and those of Iraq and Persia: “Before the 18th century, the Baghdadi Community needed the support of those communities; now the Baghdadi Community influenced them.”\n\nThe 18th century saw the Jewish community of Aleppo exert a significant influence over the Jewish communities of Baghdad and Basra not only culturally but economically. Syrian Jewish families establishing themselves in Iraq were often formerly Spanish Sephardic families from Aleppo. These were typically high-class families such as the Belilios family who were frustrated with the dimming prospects of Aleppo and attracted to Baghdad and Basra's booming trade with India. This process saw the leading Jewish families of Baghdad, Basra and Aleppo grow to be heavily interlinked through marriages, religious life, partnership and trade in the 18th century.\n\nAs this process of cultural assimilation saw the Jews of Baghdad come to more closely resemble the Jews of Aleppo, economic decline in Syria, Kurdistan and Persia worsened. The 18th century saw a growing number of Jews leave from there to Baghdad, Basra or the Baghdadi-led outposts being established in the Far East. The still small and reemerging Jewish community of Baghdad became a migration destination with Jewish families settling in Baghdad from Istanbul, Aleppo, Damascus, Ana and Basra. A key driver of this was decline of the old caravan route running between these cities. There was also migration from the communities of Palestine, the villages of Kurdistan, and it is said that a handful of Jews settled in Baghdad from Germany.\n\nBy the early 19th century, Baghdad had been reestablished as a leading Jewish center in the Middle East. There were over 6,000 Jews in city, two synagogues and strong community institutions. This was not a golden age, however. Over time, the centralized Turkish control over the region deteriorated and the situation of the Jews worsened, but the population continued to grow very rapidly. An example of this deterioration is the persecution of Dawud Pasha, which began in 1814 and lasted until 1831. Many leaders of the Jewish community, such as Solomon Ma’tuk, were forced to flee. One of the foremost leaders of the community, David Sassoon, was forced to flee first to Busher and then to India.\n\nBy the early 19th century, trade between Baghdad and India was said to be entirely in the hands of the Jewish community. Though Jewish traders from the Middle East had been crossing the Indian Ocean since antiquity, the deteriorating situation in the Ottoman Empire and the rise of commercial opportunities in British India saw many Jews from Iraq establish themselves permanently in India, at first in Surat, then especially in Calcutta and Bombay.\n\nThis was the beginning of primarily Iraqi Jewish diaspora in Asia known as the Baghdadi Jews, to which David Sassoon and many of the other leading Jewish families in Baghdad fled the persecution of Dawud Pasha. These Judeo-Arabic speaking communities, following mostly Iraqi Jewish customs, would be formed along the so-called opium route between India and China, including in Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai. These were all led by leading Iraqi Jewish families such as the Sassoons, Ezras, Eliases, Gubbays and Judahs. These families were active sponsors of religious life and charity back in Iraq.\n\nIsrael Joseph Benjamin, the Ashkenazi Jewish traveller and scholar from Moldova, who conducted extensive journeys to visit even the most furthest flung Sephardic and Mizrahi Jewish communities of Asia between 1845 and 1859, wrote of Baghdad that “in no other place in the east have I found my Israelitish brothers in such perfectly happy circumstances.” One distinguishing feature of the communities of Baghdad and Basra remarked upon by Ashkenazi travelers was the extreme young age of marriage: between eight and twelve years old for girls to men usually eighteen to twenty. Another was the traditional face veils and long flowing garments wore by Jewish women who were not expected to show their face in public like their Muslim neighbors.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the influence of the Jewish families of Aleppo of the previous century faded as Baghdad emerged as a strong Jewish and economic center in its own right. The Jewish population has grown so rapidly that by 1884, there were 30,000 Jews in Baghdad and by 1900, 50,000, comprising over a quarter of the city's total population. Large-scale Jewish immigration from Kurdistan to Baghdad continued throughout this period. By the mid-19th century, the religious infrastructure of Baghdad grew to include a large yeshiva which trained up to sixty rabbis at time. Religious scholarship flourished in Baghdad, which produced great rabbis, such as Joseph Hayyim ben Eliahu Mazal-Tov, known as the Ben Ish Chai (1834–1909) or Rabbi Abdallah Somekh (1813-1889).\n\nEarly Labor Zionism mostly concentrated on the Jews of Europe, skipping Iraqi Jews because of their lack of interest in agriculture. The result was that \"Until World War II, Zionism made little headway because few Iraqi Jews were interested in the socialist ideal of manual labor in Palestine.\"\n\nDuring the British Mandate, beginning in 1920, and in the early days after independence in 1932, well-educated Jews played an important role in civic life. Iraq's first minister of finance, Sir Sassoon Eskell, was a Jew, and Jews were important in developing the judicial and postal systems. Records from the Baghdad Chamber of Commerce show that 10 out of its 19 members in 1947 were Jews and the first musical band formed for Baghdad's nascent radio in the 1930s consisted mainly of Jews. Jews were represented in the Iraqi parliament, and many Jews held significant positions in the bureaucracy.\n\nOrganized Zionist activity began in Iraq in the 1920s. The Jewish population was generally sympathetic toward the movement, although not at that time as a solution for Iraqi Jews. The Zionist organization in Baghdad was initially granted a permit by the British, in March 1921, but in the following year, under the government of King Faisal I, was unable to renew it. Nevertheless, its activities were tolerated until 1929. In that year, after conflict and bloodshed in Palestine during anti-Zionist demonstrations, Zionist activities were banned and teachers from Palestine, who had taught Hebrew and Jewish history, were forced to leave.\n\nIn the 1930s, the situation of the Jews in Iraq deteriorated. Previously, the growing Iraqi Arab nationalist sentiment included Iraqi Jews as fellow Arabs, but these views changed with the ongoing conflict in the Palestinian Mandate and the introduction of Nazi propaganda. Despite protestations of their loyalty to Iraq, Iraqi Jews were increasingly subject to discrimination and anti-Jewish actions. In September 1934, following the appointment of Arshad al-Umari as the new minister of economics and communications, tens of Jews were dismissed from their posts in that ministry; and, subsequently, there were unofficial quotas of Jews that could be appointed in the civil service or admitted to secondary schools and colleges. Zionist activity had continued covertly even after 1929, but in 1935 the last two Palestinian Jewish teachers were deported, and the president of the Zionist organization was put on trial and ultimately required to leave the country.\nFollowing the collapse of Rashid Ali's pro-Axis coup, the Farhud (\"violent dispossession\") pogrom of June 1 and 2, 1941, broke out in Baghdad in which approximately 200 Jews were murdered (some sources put the number higher), and up to 2,000 injured—damages to property were estimated at $3 million (US$ million in 2020). There was also looting in many other cities at around the same time. Afterwards, Zionist emissaries from Palestine were sent to teach Iraqi Jews self-defense, which they were eager to learn. The monarchist government acted quickly to suppress supporters of Rashid Ali. Many Iraqis were exiled as a result, and hundreds were jailed, several were sentenced to death as a consequence of the violence by the newly established pro-British Iraqi government.\n\nBefore the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine vote, Iraq's prime minister Nuri al-Said told British diplomats that if the United Nations solution was not \"satisfactory\", \"severe measures should [would?] be taken against all Jews in Arab countries\". In a speech at the General Assembly Hall at Flushing Meadow, New York, on Friday, 28 November 1947, Iraq's Foreign Minister, Fadel Jamall, included the following statement: Partition imposed against the will of the majority of the people will jeopardize peace and harmony in the Middle East. Not only the uprising of the Arabs of Palestine is to be expected, but the masses in the Arab world cannot be restrained. The Arab-Jewish relationship in the Arab world will greatly deteriorate. There are more Jews in the Arab world outside of Palestine than there are in Palestine. In Iraq alone, we have about one hundred and fifty thousand Jews who share with Moslems and Christians all the advantages of political and economic rights. Harmony prevails among Moslems, Christians and Jews. But any injustice imposed upon the Arabs of Palestine will disturb the harmony among Jews and non-Jews in Iraq; it will breed inter-religious prejudice and hatred.\n\nIn 1948, Iraqi Kingdom was placed under martial law, and the penalties for Zionism were increased. Courts martial were used to intimidate wealthy Jews, Jews were again dismissed from civil service, quotas were placed on university positions, Jewish businesses were boycotted (E. Black, p. 347) and Shafiq Ades (one of the most important anti-Zionist Jewish businessmen in the country) was arrested and publicly hanged for allegedly selling goods to Israel, shocking the community (Tripp, 123). The Jewish community general sentiment was that if a man as well connected and powerful as Shafiq Ades could be eliminated by the state, other Jews would not be protected any longer. Additionally, like most Arab League states, Iraq forbade any legal emigration of its Jews on the grounds that they might go to Israel and could strengthen that state. At the same time, increasing government oppression of the Jews fueled by anti-Israeli sentiment together with public expressions of antisemitism created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.\n\n1948, the year of Israel's independence was a rough year for the Jews of Iraq:\n\"With very few exceptions, only Jews wore watches. On spotting one that looked expensive, a policeman had approached the owner as if to ask the hour. Once assured the man was Jewish, he relieved him of the timepiece and took him into custody. The watch, he told the judge, contained a tiny wireless; he'd caught the Jew, he claimed, sending military secrets to the Zionists in Palestine. Without examining the \"evidence\" or asking any questions, the judge pronounced his sentence. The \"traitor\" went to prison, the watch to the policeman as reward.\" (Haddad, p. 176).\n\nOn 19 February 1949, Nuri al-Said acknowledged the bad treatment that the Jews had been victims of in Iraq during the recent months. He warned that unless Israel behaved itself, events might take place concerning the Iraqi Jews.\n\nBy 1949, the Iraqi Zionist underground had become well-established (despite many arrests), and they were smuggling Iraqi Jews out of the country illegally at a rate of 1,000 a month. Hoping to stem the flow of assets from the country, in March 1950 Iraq passed a law of one year duration allowing Jews to emigrate on condition of relinquishing their Iraqi citizenship. They were motivated, according to Ian Black, by \"economic considerations, chief of which was that almost all the property of departing Jews reverted to the state treasury\" and also that \"Jews were seen as a restive and potentially troublesome minority that the country was best rid of.\" (p. 91) Iraqi politicians candidly admitted that they wanted to expel their Jewish population for reasons of their own. Israel was initially reluctant to absorb so many immigrants, (Hillel, 1987) but eventually mounted an airlift in March 1951 called \"Operation Ezra and Nehemiah\" to bring as many of the Iraqi Jews as possible to Israel, and sent agents to Iraq to urge the Jews to register for immigration as soon as possible. Between 1948 and 1951 121,633 Jews left the country, leaving 15,000 behind.\nFrom the start of the emigration law in March 1950 until the end of the year, 60,000 Jews registered to leave Iraq. In addition to continuing arrests and the dismissal of Jews from their jobs, this exodus was encouraged by a series of bombings starting in April 1950 that resulted in a number of injuries and a few deaths. Two months before the expiration of the law, by which time about 85,000 Jews had registered, another bomb at the Masuda Shemtov synagogue killed 3 or 5 Jews and injured many others. Nuri al-Said, the Iraqi prime minister, was determined to drive the Jews out of his country as quickly as possible, and on August 21, 1950 he threatened to revoke the license of the company transporting the Jewish exodus if it did not fulfill its daily quota of 500 Jews. On September 18, 1950, Nuri al-Said summoned a representative of the Jewish community and claimed Israel was behind the emigration delay, threatening to \"take them to the borders\" and forcibly expel the Jews The law expired in March 1951 but was later extended after the Iraqi government froze the assets of departing Jews, including those who had already left. During the next few months, all but a few thousand of the remaining Jews registered for emigration, spurred on by a sequence of further bombings that caused few casualties but had great psychological impact. In Operation Ezra and Nehemiah, some 120,000 Jews were airlifted to Israel via Iran and Cyprus.\n\nIn 1952, emigration to Israel was again banned, and the Iraqi government publicly hanged two Jews who had been falsely charged with throwing a bomb at the Baghdad office of the U.S. Information Agency.\n\nAccording to Palestinian politician Aref al-Aref, the pro-British Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Sa'id had attempted to justify allowing the exodus by explaining to him that: ”The Jews have always been a source of evil and harm to Iraq. They are spies. They have sold their property in Iraq, they have no land among us that they can cultivate. How therefore can they live? What will they do if they stay in Iraq? No, no my friend, it is better for us to be rid of them as long as we are able to do so.\"\n\nIraqi Jews left behind them extensive property, often located in the heart of Iraq's major cities. A relatively high number found themselves in refugee camps in Israel known as Ma'abarot before being given permanent housing.\n\nThe true identity and objective of the masterminds behind the bombings has been the subject of controversy. A secret Israeli inquiry in 1960 found no evidence that they were ordered by Israel or any motive that would have explained the attack, though it did find out that most of the witnesses believed that Jews had been responsible for the bombings. The issue remains unresolved: Iraqi activists still regularly charge that Israel used violence to engineer the exodus, while Israeli officials of the time vehemently deny it. Historian Moshe Gat reports that \"the belief that the bombs had been thrown by Zionist agents was shared by those Iraqi Jews who had just reached Israel\". Sociologist Phillip Mendes backs Gat's claims, and further attributes the allegations to have been influenced and distorted by feelings of discrimination.\n\nThe affair has also been the subject of a libel lawsuit by Mordechai Ben Porat, which was settled in an out-of-court compromise with an apology of the journalist who described the charges as true.\n\nIraqi authorities eventually charged three members of the Zionist underground with perpetrating some of the explosions. Two of those charged, Shalom Salah Shalom and Yosef Ibrahim Basri, were subsequently found guilty and executed, whilst the third was sentenced to a lengthy jail term. Salah Shalom claimed in his trial that he was tortured into confessing, and Yosef Basri maintained his innocence throughout.\n\nGat reports that much of the previous literature \"reflects the universal conviction that the bombings had a tremendous impact on the large-scale exodus of the Jews... To be more precise it is suggested that the Zionist emissaries committed these brutal acts in order to uproot the prosperous Iraqi Jewish community and bring it to Israel\". However, Gat argues that both claims are contrary to the evidence. As summarized by Mendes:\nHistorian Moshe Gat argues that there was little direct connection between the bombings and exodus. He demonstrates that the frantic and massive Jewish registration for denaturalisation and departure was driven by knowledge that the denaturalisation law was due to expire in March 1951. He also notes the influence of further pressures including the property-freezing law, and continued anti-Jewish disturbances which raised the fear of large-scale pogroms. In addition, it is highly unlikely the Israelis would have taken such measures to accelerate the Jewish evacuation given that they were already struggling to cope with the existing level of Jewish immigration. Gat also raises serious doubts about the guilt of the alleged Jewish bombthrowers. Firstly, a Christian officer in the Iraqi army known for his anti-Jewish views, was arrested, but apparently not charged, with the offences. A number of explosive devices similar to those used in the attack on the Jewish synagogue were found in his home. In addition, there was a long history of anti-Jewish bomb-throwing incidents in Iraq. Secondly, the prosecution was not able to produce even one eyewitness who had seen the bombs thrown. Thirdly, the Jewish defendant Shalom Salah indicated in court that he had been severely tortured in order to procure a confession. It therefore remains an open question as to who was responsible for the bombings, although Gat argues that the most likely perpetrators were members of the anti-Jewish Istiqlal Party. Certainly memories and interpretations of the events have further been influenced and distorted by the unfortunate discrimination which many Iraqi Jews experienced on their arrival in Israel.\n\nMany years later, the widow of the Zionist emissary Yehuda Tager stated that while the main bombings were carried out by the Muslim Brotherhood, later smaller attacks were staged by Yosef Beit-Halahmi, on his own initiative, in an attempt to make it seem as if the activists on trial were not the perpetrators.\n\nMost of the 10,000 Jews remaining after Operation Ezra and Nehemiah stayed through the Abdul Karim Qassim era when conditions improved, but anti-Semitism increased during the rule of the Arif brothers (Abdul Salam Arif and Abdul Rahman Arif).\n\nWith the rise of the Ba'ath Party to power in 1963, restrictions were placed on the remaining Iraqi Jews. Sale of property was banned, and Jews had to carry yellow identity cards.\n\nAfter the 1967 Six-Day War, Jewish property was expropriated, bank accounts were frozen, Jews were dismissed from public posts, their businesses were closed, trading permits owned by Jews were cancelled, they were not allowed to use telephones, were placed under house arrest for extended periods of time, and were under constant surveillance and restricted to the cities. In late 1968, scores of Jews were jailed on charges of spying for Israel, culminating in the 1969 public hanging of 14 men, 9 of them Jews, who were falsely accused of spying for Israel. Other suspected spies for Israel died under torture. After Baghdad Radio invited Iraqi citizens to \"come and enjoy the feast\", half a million people paraded and danced past the scaffolds where the men were hanged, which resulted in international criticism. An Iraqi Jew who later left wrote that the stress of persecution caused ulcers, heart attacks, and breakdowns to become increasingly prevalent in the Jewish community. In the early 1970s, bowing to international pressure, the Iraqi government allowed most of the remaining Jews to emigrate. \n\nImmediately prior to the Gulf War, the U.S. State Department noted that there was no recent evidence of overt persecution of Jews, but travel, particularly to Israel, was restricted, as was contact with Jewish groups abroad. In 1997, the \"Jerusalem Post\" reported that in the previous five years, some 75 Jews had fled Iraq, of whom about 20 moved to Israel and the rest mostly went to the United Kingdom and Netherlands. In the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Jewish Agency launched an effort to track down all of the remaining Iraqi Jews to present them with an opportunity to emigrate to Israel, and found a total of 34 Jews. Six chose to emigrate, among them Ezra Levy, the father of Emad Levy, Baghdad's last rabbi.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Ba'ath regime, the process of establishing a new democratic government began. Among the subjects for debate over the Iraqi constitution was whether Jews should be considered a minority group, or left out of the constitution altogether.\n\nIn October 2006, Rabbi Emad Levy announced that he was leaving for Israel and compared his life to \"living in a prison\". He reported that most Iraqi Jews stay in their homes \"out of fear of kidnapping or execution\" due to sectarian violence.\n\nPresent estimates of the Jewish population in Baghdad are eight (2007), seven (2008) five (2013). or ten (2018). Among the American forces stationed in Iraq, there were only three Jewish chaplains.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1914 by various prestigious Colombians following the leading initiative of Don Agustín Nieto Caballero. Some of the remarkable personalities who acted as co-founders of this New School (Escuela Nueva) were: Don José María Samper Brush, Don Daniel Samper Ortega, Don Tomás Rueda Vargas, and Ricardo Lleras Codazzi. These gentlemen were predominant \"freethinkers\" at the time in Colombia.\n\nThe main influences for the development of the New School in America, the first of its kind in South America, were mainly those of Ovide Decroly, Maria Montessori, and to a lesser extent, Jean Piaget. Don Agustín met all of them personally and engaged in intellectual conversation with them while studying in Europe. He carried their ideas back to America, and applied and modified them in a novel way according to the spirit and environment of Colombia in the 20th century.\n\nThe school's principle of conduct is based on the so-called discipline of trust (\"\"), following the lines of Maria Montessori's \"active discipline\". This fundamental principle seeks to instill self-confidence and inner discipline in students, as well as furthering their understanding of a deeper sense of responsibility, honesty, loyalty and friendship through the active development of freedom. The \"Gimnasio Moderno\" was awarded a national monument status due its longevity and historical stature.\n\nFurthermore, the school centers its approach to teaching around the motto \"Educar Antes que Instruir\", which translates as \"To Educate Rather than to Instruct\". This means that teaching moral values and allowing development of students as honest, self-confident, and driven individuals, takes prevalence over technical instruction. This approach results fruitful and the school remains in the top tier of schools in the country by academic standards.\n\nThe educational program is divided into four sections. The first section includes Montessori 1, 2, and 3, first Decroly, and second Decroly. The second section includes the third, fourth, and fifth Decroly grades. The third section includes the sixth through ninth grades, and the fourth section includes the tenth and eleventh grades.\n\nThe school's traditions include:\n\nA marching band (winners of the Silver Baton (Batuta de Plata) competition, won for the first time in 1999 with Sebastian Devis as drum major, then in 2006 with Nicolás Medina as drum major, in 2012 with Germán Garcia as drum major, in 2016 with Pablo Güete as drum mayor and in 2017 with Juan Felipe Noguera as drum mayor.\n\nA Football (Soccer) championship between Gimnasio Moderno and Gimnasio Campestre, called the 'Tradition Cup' (Copa Tradicion). The school also hosts the Eaglet Cup (Copa Aguilucho), a Football (Soccer) league made up of teams from different grades within the school.\n\nIn 1941, alumni from the school founded the football club Independiente Santa Fe, whose origin is traced back to a team formed by them to play a match against the school team as part of the celebrations of the school's 25th anniversary.\n\nSingle and multiple-day excursion trips throughout the country. Following the ideals of Robert Baden-Powell.\n\nSports Teams: The school has traditionally encouraged and supported its sports teams, such as the, football, basketball, volleyball and swimming teams.\n\nStudent awards: The school gives annual recognition to those students who excel in different areas. These areas are called, personal effort, kindness to others, 'excursionist spirit' and a group recognition of friendship awarded to an entire class.\n\nBrotherhood with the \"Gimnasio Femenino\": This private all-female school was conceived by Agustin Nieto Caballero and some other influential personalities of the Gimnasio Moderno in 1927. Since this, the two schools have shared a special link, they celebrate many dates together, do a wide range of activities through the year, and basically, share academic and fun moments with the opposite genre once in a while.\n\nSemana Cultural (Cultural Week) which is an ensemble of cultural activities, including the Mañana del Talento Gimnasiano (Morning of Talent) during which students present theater plays, comedy acts, and musical numbers among others. Students often make fools of themselves, but every once in a while true talents are unveiled. The school also hosts the citywide famous Concurso de Barras Maria Helena Amador(Cheerleader contest) for which cheerleader groups from all-girls schools across the city prepare through the year.\n\n\nThe marching band of the Gimnasio Moderno is one of the oldest school marching bands in Bogotá, it is more than 50 years old.\nThis is one of the most traditional school bands in Colombia.\n\n\n"}

S. Van Dine, which became a best-seller.\n\nNew York dilettante Philo Vance decides to assist the police in investigating the death of another man-about-town because he finds the psychological aspects of the crime of interest, and feels that they would be beyond the capacities of the police, even those of his friend District Attorney Markham. Vance investigates the circumstances under which the body was found and reconstructs the crime sufficiently to determine that the murderer is five feet, ten and a half inches in height. Together, Vance and Markham investigate Benson's business associates and romantic interests until Vance manages to pierce the murderer's alibi for the time of the murder and force a confession.\n\nThe novel was very loosely based upon a real-life case that had made headlines, the unsolved 1920 murder of bridge expert Joseph Bowne Elwell. It was considered a \"roman à clef\" because the circumstances under which Elwell's body was found—he was shot to death in a room in his home which was found to be locked from the inside, and he was not wearing his toupee—are duplicated in the novel. Modern knowledge of ballistics reveals that one of the central premises of the novel is fanciful, because the reconstruction of the height of the murderer is impossible (Dashiell Hammett had said as much at the time, in a 1927 book review).\n\n\"The first and best, partly because Van Dine had the real-life model of the Joseph Elwell murder (1920) to hold his fancy in check.\"\n\n\"Vance spots the murderer almost immediately but doesn't reveal him, allowing Markham and Sergeant Heath to fix the guilt on five successive persons by circumstantial evidence.\"\n\nParamount Pictures released \"The Benson Murder Case\" (1930) a film version directed by Frank Tuttle and starring William Powell as Philo Vance. The film was moderately faithful to the plot of the novel. Paramount also released a Spanish-language version, \"El Cuerpo del Delito\", written by Catalan writer Josep Carner Ribalta (1898–1988), and co-directed by Cyril Gardner and A.

{"id": "2255761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255761", "title": "Jihad vs. McWorld", "text": "Jihad vs. McWorld\n\nJihad vs. McWorld: How Globalism and Tribalism Are Reshaping the World is a 1995 book by American political scientist Benjamin Barber, in which he puts forth a theory that describes the struggle between \"McWorld\" (globalization and the corporate control of the political process) and \"Jihad\" (Arabic term for \"struggle\", here modified to mean tradition and traditional values, in the form of extreme nationalism or religious orthodoxy and theocracy). Benjamin Barber similarly questions the impact of economic globalization as well as its problems for democracy.\n\nThe book was based on a March 1992 article by Barber first published in \"The Atlantic Monthly\". The book employs the basic critique of neoliberalism seen in Barber's earlier, seminal work \"Strong Democracy\". As neoliberal economic theory—not to be confused with social liberalism—is the force behind globalization, this critique is relevant on a much larger scale. Unregulated market forces encounter parochial (which he calls tribal) forces.\n\nThese tribal forces come in many varieties: religious, cultural, ethnic, regional, local, etc. As globalization imposes a culture of its own on a population, the tribal forces feel threatened and react. More than just economic, the crises that arise from these confrontations often take on a sacred quality to the tribal elements; thus Barber's use of the term \"Jihad\" (although in the second edition, he expresses regret at having used that term).\n\nBarber's prognosis in \"Jihad vs McWorld\" is generally negative—he concludes that neither global corporations nor traditional cultures are supportive of democracy. He further posits that McWorld could ultimately win the \"struggle\". He also proposes a model for small, local democratic institutions and civic engagement as the hope for an alternative to these two forces.\n\nBarber states that neither Jihad nor McWorld needs or promotes democracy.\n\nBarber argues that there are several imperatives that make up the McWorld, or the globalization of politics: a market imperative, a resource imperative, an information-technology imperative, and an ecological imperative. Due to globalization, our market has expanded and is vulnerable to the transnational markets where free trade, easy access to banking and exchange of currency are available. With the emergence of our markets, we have come up with international laws and treaties in order to maintain stability and efficiency in the interconnected economy. Resources are also an imperative aspect in the McWorld, where autarky seems insufficient and inefficient in presence of globalization. The information-technology of globalization has opened up communications to people all over the world, allowing us to exchange information. Also, technology is now systematically integrated into everyone's lives to the point where it \"gives every person on earth access to every other person\". Globalization of ecology may seem cliche; Barber argues that whatever a nation does to their own ecology, it affects everyone on Earth. For instance, cutting down a jungle will upset the overall oxygen balance, which affects our \"global lungs\". McWorld may promote peace and prosperity, but Barber sees this as being done at the cost of independence and identity, and notes that no more social justice or equality than necessary are needed to promote efficient economic production and consumption.\n\nBarber sees Jihad as offering solidarity and protecting identities, but at the potential cost of tolerance and stability. Barber describes the solidarity needed within the concept of Jihad as being secured through exclusion and war against outsiders. As a result, he argues, different forms of anti-democratization can arise through anti-democratic one-party dictatorships, military juntas, or theocratic fundamentalism. Barber also describes through modern day examples what these 'players' are. \"[T]hey are cultures, not countries; parts, not wholes; sects, not religions, rebellious factions and dissenting minorities at war not just with globalism but with the traditional nation-state. Kurds, Basques, Puerto Ricans, Ossetians, East Timoreans, Quebecois, the Catholics of Northern Ireland, Catalans, Tamils, and of course, Palestinians – people with countries, inhabiting nations not their own, seeking smaller worlds within borders that will seal them off from modernity.\"\n\nBarber writes democracy can be spread and secured through the world satisfying the needs of both the McWorld and Jihad. \"With its concern for accountability, the protection of minorities, and the universal rule of law, a confederalized representative system would serve the political needs of McWorld as well as oligarchic bureaucratism or meritocratic elitism is currently doing.\" Some can accept democracy faster than others. Every case is different, however \"Democracy grows from the bottom up and cannot be imposed from the top down. Civil society has to be built from the inside out.\" He goes on to further explain exactly what the confederal option means and how it will help. \"It certainly seems possible that the most attractive democratic ideal in the face of the brutal realities of Jihad and the dull realities of McWorld will be a confederal union of semi autonomous communities smaller than nation-states, tied together into regional economic associations and markets larger than nation-states—participatory and self-determining in local matters at the bottom, representative and accountable at the top. The nation-state would play a diminished role, and sovereignty would lose some of its political potency.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2255772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255772", "title": "Power Instinct", "text": "Power Instinct\n\nPower Instinct, released in Japan as , is a fighting video game series created by Atlus.\n\nThe series is known for its absurdist humor. Unique to the series was the introduction of the transformation feature: several of the characters can change their appearance and fighting style by simply executing certain moves (usually a throwing move), though this has not been featured in every entry in the series. Other features include the ability for every character to perform a double jump, run, and attack while running.\n\nReleased in Japan as , the first game of the series was released in 1993. In it, players play as a member of the Gōketsuji clan, who are battling to determine who will replace 78-year-old Oume Gōketsuji as head of the clan. It has eight selectable characters and one unplayable boss character, Oume Gōketsuji, a palette-swap of her younger sister Otane. Originally, every character had a specific win quote for each defeated foe, but that was reduced to only one win quote for each character in the English version.\n\nThis game was ported to Super NES and includes some new play modes: Vs. Battle, Practice Mode, Time Attack and a \"Life Attack\" that consists of defeating as many opponents as possible with just one life bar (similar to the Survival Modes seen in other fighting games). The Mega Drive version was never released outside of Japan.\n\nThe Mega Drive version has a Battle Royal mode where 1 or 2 players can select a team, with an option to hide the characters being chosen so they are not revealed until the fight. Additionally, it features an option that allows the strength of each special attack of every playable character to be adjusted to the player's liking.\n\nThe English console ports of this game had several omitted features, such as Karaoke Mode with the lyrics for the songs \"Tatanka no Uta\" and \"Otoko no Karatemichi\", character biographies that pop up in between demos, the intro demo to the game and the scene of Oume where she speaks to the player before she fights them (which changes if she's fighting Otane). The Super NES version also replaces the endings that were in the Japanese Super Famicom version with a congratulations screen with the character portraits used in the pre-fight screen.\n\n\nReviewing the Super NES version, \"GamePro\" judged that \"\"Power Instinct\" falls along the lines of \"Fatal Fury\", but it falls short.\" They praised the double jumps and special moves, but criticized the \"passable\" graphics and sound and the fact that the boss is just a palette swap of a playable character. A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" said the game has \"average graphics, decent play control, and moves you've mostly seen before. ... Nothing wrong here, it's just typical.\" He gave the Super NES version two out of five stars.\n\nReleased in Japan as , \"Power Instinct 2\" features five new characters, giving a total of 13 playable characters and one unplayable boss (Otane Gōketsuji). The game's story picks off from the last game, with Otane having defeated her sister Oume in the previous tournament. However, with the help of their mother Oshima Gōketsuji, Oume kidnapped her sister, threw her into the ocean, and forged a letter saying that Otane has quit as leader, resulting in a new tournament. Otane does escape and fights the winner of the tournament in a bid to defend her leadership of the Gōketsuji clan.\n\nThe game introduces the \"Stress\" meter into the series, which increases when one's attacks are blocked or when attacked. A super attack can be executed when it is full. In addition, when the Stress meter fills up, a character becomes engulfed in a flame of their own energy for a brief moment, which protects from any incoming attacks from the opponent and knocks them away if they are too close.\n\nThe PlayStation version, retitled , was only released in Japan. As the subtitle might indicate, it shares some characteristics from \"Gogetsuji Legends\" (described below), like the team battle and the possibility to play as Chuck and Kuroko, but these features are only available for Versus (player vs. player) mode. Unlike the arcade game, anytime a transformable character changed into his or her alternate version in the PlayStation port, there was considerable loading time that interrupted the match.\n\n\nOn release, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored the PlayStation version of the game a 23 out of 40.\n\nKnown as in Japan. This installment lacks the \"Power Instinct\" title in its localization; this would be a trend for the series in its subsequent western releases, officially phasing out the \"Power Instinct\" branding. The game's story picks up from the last game, with Otane being defeated by Kanji Kokuin, who became the new leader of the Gouketsuji clan.\n\nThis game is a sort of \"update\" to \"Power Instinct 2\". All previous characters reappear, plus a few new characters. Super Kurara and Pochi are individual characters; because of this, Kurara and Kinta lost their transformations but gained new moves to replace them. Otane is also made playable. There is one new playable character, Kuroko, and a new playable boss, Chuck, bringing the cast to 16 characters.\n\nThe battles are in teams of two characters, a leader and a partner. This plays out similarly to \"The King of Fighters\", where you fight with each character one after the other. A Super Block and a Charge Attack were brought into the gameplay. A Super Block can nullify the opponent's blow and allow for a counterattack, and a Charge Attack can immediately knock down the opponent or launch them into the air for another attack. All of the characters were given new special attacks, though the majority of them were exclusive to this game.\n\nFully titled , this was a Japan exclusive. The story takes place 20 years after the last Gōketsuji tournament. It has a darker and more serious tone than its predecessors, similar to that of \"\", but still maintains some of the same humor that is particular to the series. Otane and Oume are the only returning characters, fighting as a single entry as they tied themselves back-to-back to each other.\n\nThe players can choose from eleven characters; all of them, save Otane/Oume, are new. The graphic style of \"Groove on Fight\" is very different from its predecessors, as the sprites are smaller, but are more fluid and have an animated look to them.\n\nThe Sega Saturn port of the game included some features like being able to play as Damian, Bristol Weller, and Bristol-D once the player beats the game with certain characters, the possibility of four players to play at the same time by way of the Saturn's multi-tap and an \"Omake Mode\" where the players can view artwork of the characters for the game. The Saturn version also features an arranged version of the soundtrack that has some new music themes that were not present in the original, like the theme \"Mystic\" and the vocal version of the title song.\n\n\nGameplay is in a 2-on-2 format much like \"Legends\", but with the ability to tag in and out at any time between players, similar to \"X-Men vs. Street Fighter\". Whenever the player tags successfully between characters, the character who is on the sidelines slowly begins to get his or her energy back.\n\nA big difference from the previous games is that \"Groove on Fight\" has a six buttons system. The two new buttons are for \"Dodge\" and for the \"Powerful Blow\", but are also used for stronger versions of special moves. the \"Dodge\" allows the characters to evade attacks and then counterattack the opponent. The \"Powerful Blow\" is an attack that inflicts more damage to the opponent than the normal strong attacks, but is also slower. The special guard and the shadow moves from \"Gogetsuji Legends\" are still present in the game and some other new characteristics were introduced to the gameplay:\n\nThis new sequel, fully titled in Japan, brings back the roster from \"Power Instinct 2\" (except Angela, Oshima, Sahad and Kinta, the latter of whom was replaced by his alter-ego, Pochi), plus 4 totally new characters and one new boss (Princess Sissy). However, all the characters introduced in \"Groove of Fight\" were discarded. Jimmy, Elias, Lynn and Jones from \"Rage of the Dragons\" are guest stars, and are unlockable. A few of the game elements were borrowed from that same game as well. The western releases drop the \"Shin Gouketsuji Ichizoku\" title and remains named simply as \"Matrimelee\" (though the \"Toukon\" mark still appears). It was one of the last games to be released on the Neo Geo.\n\nIt was followed by PlayStation 2 port . It was released exclusively in Japan. It features enhanced graphics and sound, the return of two of the older characters (Angela Belti and Kinta Kokuin), a new boss (Bobby Strong), and the return of the transformation feature. Gameplay was also improved in some areas, and super attacks were made easier to execute. The game has the same backgrounds and all the characters from \"Matrimelee\" (except the four secret characters from \"Rage of the Dragons\"), and because of that it is usually described as a port of the game, while in fact the game's story takes place after the events from the previous game, making it a sort of sequel or update. The game tells the story of the king from the previous game, who holds a \"Bonnou Kaihou\" (\"Liberation of Lusts\") tournament to cheer up his daughter Princess Sissy. This time the prize is anything that the winner could wish for (except the throne succession).\n\n\n is currently the latest game in the series. It refocuses on the Gōketsuji clan, with Oume announcing a new tournament. Several new characters were introduced:\n\n\nVarious merchandise based on the series has been released in Japan. The 253-page 1995 novel \"Gouketsuji Ichizoku: The Novel\" () was published by Wani Books in 1995. It relates the history of the Gōketsuji family and features some art made by Range Murata. \"Gōketsuji Ichizoku: THE CD-ROM\" was published in 1998 by Toshiba EMI and contains information about the series including characters profiles, correlation diagrams, the family lineage, concept art, sounds and other artwork. It also has desktop wallpapers and screen savers.\n\nSoundtracks to the first five games in the series were also released. Pony Canyon/Scitron released the first four, while Noise Factory released the \"Matrimelee\" soundtrack. In 2005, Noise Factory released a box set of all soundtracks to the first five games in the series, along with a 2005 calendar featuring art from the. Unlike the original releases, the CDs in the box art do not include the sound effects collections and the \"Groove on Fight\"'s CD has the arranged tracks from the Sega Saturn.\n\n"}

A notable landmark in colonial times, the islets are less well known as the Three Sisters Islands and Three Sisters Island. \n\nBridges have been proposed for the Three Sisters several times, most recently in the 1960s, when the Three Sisters Bridge proposal led to a decade of protests and ultimately, its cancellation.\n\nThe Three Sisters are part of the Fall Line, a geologic feature which distinguishes the sedimentary coastal plain of the mid-Atlantic region of the United States from the basement rock of the inland. Part of this basement rock, the Three Sisters are composed of granite. Roughly 300,000 years ago, Atlantic Ocean levels were much higher. At that time, the lower Potomac River was submerged beneath the Atlantic Ocean, whose shores reached the Three Sisters.\n\nThe Potomac River near Washington, D.C. averages between 10-20' deep -- except near shore or the 3 Sisters Islands. However, there is a deep channel near the Three Sisters which generally is about deep, but can drop to just or less during low tide or periods of little precipitation. The rock formation generates sand bars which are often visible at low tide. No grass grows on the sandbars near 3 Sisters Islands -- which are fully submerged at high tide. The height of the sandbars wax and wane according to floods, spring silt runoff, and drought. \n\nThe (traditional) navigational high water mark is Georgetown -- which is why the town came to be. Georgetown (which preceded the establishment of Washington, DC) was the furthest point inland that shipping vessels coming up from the Atlantic Ocean, could reliably reach. The C&O canal was proposed as a means of navigating inland beyond Georgetown -- and past the obstructions of Little and Great Falls. \n\nVarious legends and historical oral tales are associated with the Three Sisters. Boaters will tell you of the story of the three nuns who drowned there where the three rocks are. This is also the deepest part of the river. One of the earliest stories involves three Algonquian sisters who crossed the river in an attempt to win the release of their brothers, who had been kidnapped by another tribe. They drowned while crossing the river, and were turned into the rocky islets. A less commonly cited legend says three daughters of the local Native American chief were marooned on the islands by their father after rejecting the husbands he picked out for them. The legend holds that the sisters cursed the spot, saying that if they could not cross the Potomac there, no one could. A strange moaning or bell-like sound is said to come from the Potomac River when the curse is about to claim another life.\n\nThe first European to see the Three Sisters was Captain John Smith, who sailed up the Potomac River and saw them in 1607. The islets were a landmark in colonial times, and appeared on Pierre L'Enfant's first map of the area.\n\nA bridge across the Potomac River, using the Three Sisters as part of the supporting piers, was first proposed by Pierre L'Enfant in 1789. A bridge was again proposed at the site in 1826, but the plan was defeated after supporters of Chain Bridge (then a toll bridge) opposed it. A bridge was planned again in 1857, but debate over its exact location lasted for years. The onset of the American Civil War forced the cancellation of the plan.\n\nIn 1929, the Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway was renamed the George Washington Memorial Parkway by Congress, which authorized its extension to the Great Falls of the Potomac. The idea for a large George Washington Memorial Parkway came from Representative Louis C. Cramton, who introduced legislation in January 1929 to construct a larger system of roads and parks. In the Senate, the bill was amended by Carter Glass to include a bridge across the Potomac at the Great Falls of the Potomac. Congress enacted the \"Act of May 29, 1930\" (46 Stat. 482) — more commonly known as the Capper-Cramton Act — to establish the George Washington Memorial Parkway. The act appropriated $13.5 million to acquire land and build a parkway on the Virginia shoreline from Mount Vernon to the Great Falls of the Potomac (excluding the city of Alexandria), and to build a parkway on the Maryland shoreline from Fort Washington, Maryland, to the Great Falls of the Potomac (excluding the District of Columbia). (This section is now known as the Clara Barton Parkway.) A bridge across the Potomac at or near the Great Falls was also included in the final bill.\n\nIn 1957, Senator Clifford P. Case introduced legislation that would require the District of Columbia to build a bridge across the Three Sisters connecting D.C. and Virginia. In mid-1961, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation proposed constructing a six-lane, bridge linking the Virginia and D.C. segments of the George Washington Memorial Parkway at the Three Sisters. The bridge was designed to carry the unbuilt Interstate 266, part of the proposed Inner Loop system of beltway superhighways designed for the inner parts of the District of Columbia. Construction of the bridge would also have required that Congress fund construction of the proposed Potomac River Freeway. Over the next 11 years, there would be several lawsuits (most of which were won by opponents of the bridge) and numerous protests — including an attempt to occupy the Three Sisters.\n\nIn 1966, Representative William Natcher, chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations for the District of Columbia of the House Committee on Appropriations, threatened to withhold money for the construction of the Washington Metro if the bridge were not built. Natcher was a strong advocate of highway construction, and used his subcommittee position to win support for public works projects in his home district; it was the House Public Works Committee which had first approved the bridge. A bitter eight-year political battle occurred, during which Natcher repeatedly deleted money for Metro from the federal budget. Repeatedly District of Columbia and United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) officials would agree to build the bridge, causing the Metro money to be restored, and then reasons for not building the bridge would be found. Finally, in December 1971, Representative Robert Giaimo led a successful revolt on the House floor which restored the Metro funding over Natcher's vehement opposition. Without the threat of losing Metro money, D.C. and USDOT officials quietly deleted the bridge from their construction plans. The bridge project was declared dead by \"The Washington Post\" in May 1977.\n\nThe islets are integral to the plot of Breena Clarke's best-selling novel \"River, Cross My Heart\", set in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., in 1925. A false legend about the landmark (that three nuns drowned at the Three Sisters, giving the rocks their name) is given in \"River, Cross My Heart\", and also by David Baldacci in his novel \"The Camel Club\".\n\nThe islets also appear in Carolivia Herron's 1992 novel \"Thereafter, Johnnie\", and in Margaret Truman's 1995 murder-mystery novel \"Murder on the Potomac\".\n\n"}

The production features Robert Mitchum, Lizabeth Scott, Robert Ryan, William Conrad and Ray Collins.\n\nThe film, a remake of the 1928 film \"The Racket\", is based on the Bartlett Cormack play. (Edward G. Robinson played the racketeer in the original Broadway production.)\n\nThe plot is very close to the original play and 1928 movie. Racketeer and mobster Nick Scanlon (Ryan) has managed to buy several of the local government and law-enforcement officials of a large midwestern American city. However, he can't seem to touch the incorruptible police captain Tom McQuigg (Mitchum), who refuses all attempts at bribery. The city's prosecuting attorney, Welch (Collins), and a state police detective, Turk (Conrad), are crooked and make McQuigg's job as an honest officer nearly impossible.\n\nMcQuigg persuades a sexy nightclub singer (Scott) to testify against Scanlon, which makes her marked for death from the mob. McQuigg not only wants to nail Scanlon, but also stop all the mob corruption in the city – without getting himself or his witness killed. A bomb explodes near McQuigg's home, frightening his wife, Mary.\n\nHonest cop Bob Johnson is helpful to McQuigg, as is reporter Dave Ames, who has a romantic interest in Irene. At the police precinct one night, Scanlon walks in alone demanding to see Irene, who is being held in protective custody, and kills Johnson in cold blood. After a car chase, Scanlon is arrested. McQuigg ignores the gangster's lawyer, ripping up his writ of habeas corpus. McQuigg has the gun that killed Johnson, which has Scanlon's fingerprints on it.\n\nWelch and Turk make a phone call to Scanlon's unseen mob boss for instructions. They end up telling Scanlon he must remain locked up until after the next election, angering the gangster, who threatens to tell all. Welch and Turk then gesture toward a window and silently coax Scanlon to make a run for it.\n\nScanlon gets his hands on the murder weapon, but it's been emptied of bullets by McQuigg, who had foreseen everything Scanlon would try. Scanlon is shot dead by Turk, who then is taken into a room with Welch by investigators bringing subpoenas. Irene leaves with Dave, indicating her interest in him. McQuigg goes home with his wife after a long day, aware that tomorrow will probably be just as busy.\n\n\n\"New York Times\" critic Bosley Crowther panned the film. He wrote, \"In this consummation, however, the conflict of cop and crook is conspicuously unoriginal, considering the number of times that it has been contemplated on the screen since \"The Racket\" was first produced, and the staging of it, under the direction of John Cromwell, is dismally uninspired. Furthermore, the construction of the screen play by W. R. Burnett and William Wister Haines is so badly disordered toward the finish that it is almost impossible to perceive the intricacies of the planning by which the cop lures the crook to his doom. As a consequence, the collision of Mr. Mitchum and Mr. Ryan is a pretty dull one, in this instance marked mainly by exchanges of clichés, and the rest of the cast does little to add life to the activities.\"\n\n\"Variety\" magazine, on the other hand, gave the film a positive review, \"This remake of Bartlett Cormack's old play has been handled to emphasize clearcut action and suspense and the casting is just right to stress the rough and ready toughness in the script ... Further masculine attention is gained through the strong work of William Talman as a rookie cop ... Development is enlivened with some solid thriller sequences, such as a rooftop fight between Mitchum and a gunman, careening autos and crashes, and gunplay between the forces of good and evil.\"\n\nWriting recently, critic Dennis Schwartz was disappointed with the film, writing, \"... this film didn't have enough punch to be hard-hitting, as it softened all the things about widespread city corruption and made all the characters into one-dimensional types. All it had going were the action scenes and some gloss, as the original version was a much more effective film ... The film is more reflective of the 1920s than the 1940s, unfortunately it's set in the '40s. This is a typical gangster film of that era but is dated and too murky.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2255820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255820", "title": "Transthoracic echocardiogram", "text": "Transthoracic echocardiogram\n\nA transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is the most common type of echocardiogram, which is a still or moving image of the internal parts of the heart using ultrasound. In this case, the probe (or ultrasonic transducer) is placed on the chest or abdomen of the subject to get various views of the heart. It is used as a non-invasive assessment of the overall health of the heart, including a patient's heart valves and degree of heart muscle contraction (an indicator of the ejection fraction). The images are displayed on a monitor for real-time viewing and then recorded.\n\nA TTE is a clinical tool to evaluate the structure and function of the heart. All four chambers and all four valves can be assessed by TTE, but the quality and visibility of these structures varies from person to person. Other structures visible on TTE include the aorta, the pericardium, pleural effusions, ascites, and inferior vena cava. It can be used to detect a heart attack, enlargement/hypertrophy of the heart and infiltration of the heart from an abnormal substance (e.g. amyloidosis). Weakness of the heart, cardiac tumors and a variety of other findings can be diagnosed with a TTE. With advanced measurements of the movement of the tissue with time (Tissue Doppler), it can measure diastolic function, fluid status, and ventricular dyssynchrony.\n\nTTE in adults is also of limited use for the structures at the back of the heart, such as the left atrial appendage. Transesophageal echocardiography may be more accurate than TTE because it excludes the variables previously mentioned and allows closer visualization of common sites for vegetations and other abnormalities. Transesophageal Echocardiography also affords better visualization of prosthetic heart valves and clots within the four chambers of the heart. This type of Echocardiogram may be a better option for patients with thick chests, abnormal chest walls, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the obese.\n\n\"Bubble contrast TTE\" involves the injection of agitated saline into a vein, followed by an Echocardiographic study. The bubbles are initially detected in the right atrium and right ventricle. If bubbles appear in the left heart, this may indicate a shunt, such as a patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect or arteriovenous malformations in the lungs.\n\nIf your doctor deems it necessary, a stress TTE may be performed. This can be accomplished by either exercising on a bike or treadmill, or by medicine given through an IV along with a contrast agent to make your bodily fluids show up brighter. This allows a comparison between your heart at rest and your heart when it is beating at a faster rate. (Transthoracic Echocardiogram, n.d.)\n\nThere are some risks associated when having an echocardiogram performed. It is possible that the images will not show up clearly enough, which can cause a misdiagnosis.\n\nThere are numerous indications for a TTE:\n\nA typical TTE examination is done by either a cardiologist or a cardiac sonographer. It is a non-invasive test that can be done in many settings that include clinic exam room, inpatient rooms, and exam rooms dedicated to echo imaging. Examination involves using an echo probe at various windows to obtain views of the heart and capturing images/videos for later playback while formally \"reading\" the study to come up with findings of the study. Examination is usually done while laying flat and tilted onto the left side to bring the heart into better view. Ultrasound gel is used to improve the acoustic windows and increase quality of the captured images. Overall, an uncomplicated TTE exam takes less than 30 minutes.\n\nLimited studies (ie, looking at only specific structures) can be done as a follow up exam to a full study, or can be done as \"point of care\" to answer specific questions in the appropriate setting. For example, critically ill patients often have \"bedside ultrasounds\" performed to assess particular questions the treating team has about their status. This could be looking for cardiac tamponade and acute valve regurgitation. Often, this may include examination of other organ systems such as lungs for effusions or the focused assessment with sonography for trauma.\n\nInterpretation of the exam can be done by anyone trained in reading echocardiograms. However, this is often limited to cardiologists for \"formal reading\" of these studies. Anesthesiologists can perform intra-operative TEE's during surgical cases and they interpret their own studies. Anyone performing a bedside or \"point of care\" echocardiogram is expected to interpret their own study as it is performed. Pocket-sized TTE devices are growing in popularity.\n\nTTE is inherently limited in what it is capable of doing. Notably, it must be used through the skin, and ultrasound waves must go through skin and soft tissue before reaching the heart. This is in contrast to transesophageal echo (TEE) in which the probe is directly behind the left atrium in the esophagus and has far less tissue to penetrate, which means images from TEE are far superior in quality. Extremes in body sizes (obesity and cachexia) limit the acoustic windows and degrade the image quality of TTE's.\n\nTTE is also limited in its views of structures. Being a surface modality, the structures closest to the skin are better visualized than those deeper to the skin. A common example that demonstrates this is the visibility of the left atrial appendage. This structure is known to form clots in atrial fibrillation and the LAA is rarely seen on TTE but readily seen on TEE. Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in someone not on anticoagulation would require TEE to best visualize the LAA to rule out a thrombus. (If a thrombus is present, there is a much higher risk of stroke if returned to a sinus rhythm.)\n\nLike all of the kinds of echocardiography, TTE is limited to structure and function. It is not, for example, able to determine perfusion of the myocardium, which would require a metabolic imaging modality such as PET or SPECT stress testing. Perfusion can be inferred based on wall motion, however.\n\nThis is the most common modality used today. A 2-dimensional plane is formed by sweeping the ultrasound waves to obtain an image that varies with angle and depth. Evaluation of the structures is done in this view.\n\nThis modality is obtained at a single angle and then plotted against time to obtain an image. It can be used to watch the movement of structures with time\n\nColor doppler is a form of 2D echo in which the doppler shift of the structures is shown as color. Typically, this is shown as red and blue with red indicating movement toward the transducer and blue indicating movement away from the transducer. This can be used to show blood flow through the valves to visually indicate the direction of blood flow. Abnormal blood flow can reflect stenosis and regurgitation of the valve. Color doppler can also show blood flow in abnormal locations such as with septal defects (ASD or VSD).\n\nColor doppler can also be applied to M-mode. Using color doppler in this way gives better visualization of the changes in flow with time due to the higher frame rate with M-mode.\n\nSpectral doppler is presented similarly to M-mode in which the doppler information is plotted as a spectrogram. This can be both \"continuous\" and \"pulse\" wave where the former shows the spectrum along a specific line and the latter shows within a small window along that line. Continuous wave is better at showing maximal velocities and pulse wave is better for showing flow through a small volume.\n\nSpectral doppler is often used for quantification of flow. For example, the aortic valve area can be estimated using the continuity equation by measuring the velocity time integral (VTI) of the aortic valve & LV outflow tract; the VTI is calculated by tracing the flow on the spectral doppler curve. Spectral doppler is also useful for calculating the maximum flow and mean flow through a valve (used to grade valve stenosis).\nTissue doppler can be used to determine motion of myocardial tissue. This can be used to measure motion of the septal and lateral mitral annulus to suggest diastolic heart failure.\n\nThe images obtained with echocardiography are in reference to the heart itself. Two key axes of the heart are the long axis and short axis. The long axis is an imaginary line from the apex of the heart through the center of the mitral valve. The short axis is perpendicular to the long axis and shows the heart in cross section.\n\nEvaluation of the heart with echocardiography requires having \"acoustic windows\" of the heart. Bone reflects the ultrasound waves and so all structures directly behind bone are not visible with ultrasound. This requires that the heart be viewed between bones and, in particular, between ribs. The most common views are the parasternal, apical, subcostal, and suprasternal windows..\n\nThere are several typical views obtained during a routine TTE. Views outside of the typical views can be considered \"off axis\" and may be obtained for specific purposes.\n\nThis view is obtained to the left of the sternum and views the heart in its long axis. In this view, the mitral valve, aortic valve, right ventricular outflow tract, base of the left ventricle, and the left atrium can be visible. Angulation in this view can bring the right ventricular inflow tract and tricuspid valve into view, and angulation the opposite way can bring the pulmonary valve into view.\n\nIn this view, it is possible to appreciate the long-axis cross section of the mitral and aortic valves. The classic \"hockey stick\" shape of rheumatic mitral stenosis can be appreciated in this view. However, the angle of the probe with these valves can lead to under-appreciation of valve dysfunction.\n\nThe parasternal long view of the pulmonary valve is the only view of the posterior leaflet.\n\nStructures visible:\n\nMeasurements in this view can be used to quantify the heart:\n\nThis view is obtained in the same window as the parasternal long, but with the probe rotated 90°. In this view, the aortic valve is seen in cross-section with the right ventricular inflow & outflow tracts visible with the tricuspid valve as well. Pulmonary valve is not visible in this view. Both the right and left atria are visible.\n\nThe standard PSAX view is at the level of the aortic valve, but moving the probe along the long-axis can review the LV outflow tract, LV at the base, and LV at the midsection.\n\nStructures visible:\n\nMeasurements in this view can be used to quantify the heart:\n\nThis view is obtained at the apex of the heart and looking toward the base of the heart (where the valves are). In this view, the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, and all four chambers are visible. This view shows the right ventricle from base to apex and is a useful view to estimate RV systolic function. TAPSE (= tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) is also measured in this view with M-mode through the lateral tricuspid annulus.\n\nStructures:\n\nMeasurements in this view can be used to quantify the heart:\n\nThis view is obtained at the same window as the apical four chamber and then rotation of the probe. In this view, the mitral valve and aortic valve are in view and is roughly similar to the parasternal long axis. In this view, the LV outflow tract is best in alignment with the probe and so gives the best estimate of flow through the LVOT, which is commonly used to estimate aortic stenosis.\n\nStructures:\n\nMeasurements in this view can be used to quantify the heart:\n\nThis view is obtained at the same window as the apical four chamber and then rotation of the probe. In this view, the mitral valve is visible with the left atrium and left ventricle.\n\nStructures:\n\nMeasurements in this view can be used to quantify the heart:\n\nThis view is obtained below the sternum and at the top part of the abdomen. In this view, the junction of the inferior vena cava with the right atrium is best seen. From this window, it is possible in some people to see roughly equivalent views of the apical four chamber and parasternal short views. In some people, this may afford these common views but at a subcostal window that may not be obtained through the parasternal and/or apical windows because of various reasons such as chest wall trauma, open wounds, or poor acoustic windows. However, the subcostal window is the only window to view the inferior vena cava that can help support an estimation of the central venous pressure based on size and collapsibility during respiration.\n\nOther non-cardiac structures are visible in this view and some pathologies — such as ascites — can be observed.\n\nThis view is obtained above the sternum in the suprasternal notch. In this view, the aortic arch and portion of the descending aorta can be seen. Color and spectral doppler through the descending aorta can show signs of coarctation of the aorta.\nExamples of TTE views of various structures of the heart.\n\nRoutine TTE exams can provide a significant wealth of information about the heart's structure and function:\n\nAll function dysfunction is graded on a scale (normal, trace, mild, moderate, or severe) based on various criteria. Grading of valve function is used for prognosis and helps determine management as valve dysfunction progresses.\n\nEcho societies have published normal ranges for various features of the heart on various views to promote TTE as a quantifiable assessment of the heart.\n\nQuantitative echo utilizes a number of equations to calculate aspects of the heart structure and function. Simplified Bernoulli equation and continuity equation are two common equations used. Others are used in grading valve function (e.g., EROA, PISA).\n\nTTE can be useful for diagnosing many cardiac diseases.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2255828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255828", "title": "Social fascism", "text": "Social fascism\n\nSocial fascism was a theory supported by the Communist International (Comintern) and affiliated communist parties during the early 1930s which held that social democracy was a variant of fascism because it stood in the way of a dictatorship of the proletariat, in addition to a shared corporatist economic model.\n\nAt the time, leaders of the Comintern such as Joseph Stalin and Rajani Palme Dutt argued that capitalist society had entered the Third Period in which a working class revolution was imminent, but could be prevented by social democrats and other \"fascist\" forces.\n\nThe term \"social fascist\" was used pejoratively to describe social democratic parties, anti-Comintern and progressive socialist parties and dissenters within Comintern affiliates throughout the interwar period. The \"social fascism\" theory was advocated vociferously by the Communist Party of Germany, which was largely controlled and funded by the Soviet leadership from 1928.\n\nAt the Sixth Congress of the Comintern in 1928, the end of capitalist stability and the beginning of the \"Third Period\" was proclaimed. The end of capitalism, accompanied with a working class revolution, was expected and social democracy was identified as the main enemy of the communists. This Comintern's theory had roots in Grigory Zinoviev's argument that international social democracy is a wing of fascism. This view was accepted by Joseph Stalin who described fascism and social democracy as \"twin brothers\", arguing that fascism depends on the active support of the social democracy and that the social democracy depends on the active support of fascism. After it was declared at the Sixth Congress, the theory of social fascism became accepted by the world communist movement.\n\nThe new direction was closely linked to the internal politics of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). After a faction fight inside that party following the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924, the victorious group around Stalin shifted decisively to the left, advocating the end of the mixed economy New Economic Policy and declaring an intensification of the class struggle inside the Soviet Union. An atmosphere of revolutionary fervour was created that saw any enemy of the ruling group around Stalin denounced as \"wreckers\" and \"traitors\" and this attitude was translated on to the international stage where both social democrats and communist dissidents were denounced as fascists.\n\nAt the same time, under leadership of German chancellor Hermann Müller the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) agreed with anti-communist parties that Stalinists are fascists. This led to mutual hostility between social democrats and communists, which were additionally intensified in 1929 when Berlin's police (under control of the SPD government) shot down communist workers demonstrating on May Day in what became called Blutmai (Berlin's Bloody May). This and the repressive legislation against the communists that followed served as further evidence to communists that social democrats were indeed \"social fascists\". In 1929 the KPD's paramilitary organisation, the Roter Frontkämpferbund (\"Alliance of Red Front-Fighters\"), was banned as extremist by the governing social democrats. A KPD resolution described the \"social fascists\" [social democrats] as the \"main pillar of the dictatorship of Capital.\" In 1931, in Prussia—the largest state of Germany—the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), which referred to the Nazis as \"working people's comrades\", united with them in unsuccessful attempt to bring down the state government of SPD by means of a Landtag referendum. German communists continued to deny any essential difference between Nazism and social democracy even after elections in 1933. Under the leadership of Ernst Thälmann, the KPD coined the slogan \"After Hitler, our turn!\" – strongly believing that united front against Nazis was not needed and that the workers would change their opinion and recognize that Nazism—unlike communism—did not offer a true way out of Germany's difficulties (see also Wilhelm Hoegner and Walter Kolbenhoff.\n\nAfter Adolf Hitler's Nazis came to power in Germany, the KPD was outlawed and thousands of its members were arrested, including Thälmann. Following these events, the Comintern did a complete turn on the question of alliance with social democrats and the theory of \"social fascism\" was abandoned. At the Seventh Congress of the Comintern in 1935, Georgi Dimitrov outlined the new policy of the \"popular front\" in his address \"For the Unity of the Working Class Against Fascism\". The \"popular front\" did not stop the conclusion of the Nazi-Soviet Non-aggression Pact.\n\nTheodore Draper argued that \"the so-called theory of social fascism and the practice based on it constituted one of the chief factors contributing to the victory of German fascism in January 1933.\"\n\nLeon Trotsky argued against the accusations of \"social fascism\" and in the \"Bulletin of the Opposition\" of March 1932 declared: \"Should fascism come to power, it will ride over your skulls and spines like a terrific tank... And only a fighting unity with the Social Democratic workers can bring victory\". However, Trotsky said in the same essay that any cooperation with the social democrats was only tactical and temporary and that in the final analysis the social democracy would have to be defeated and subverted by the revolutionary faction: The front must now be directed against fascism. And this common front of direct struggle against fascism, embracing the entire proletariat, must be utilized in the struggle against the Social Democracy, directed as a flank attack, but no less effective for all that... No common platform with the Social Democracy, or with the leaders of the German trade unions, no common publications, banners, placards! March separately, but strike together! Agree only how to strike, whom to strike, and when to strike! Such an agreement can be concluded even with the devil himself... No retraction of our criticism of the Social Democracy. No forgetting of all that has been. The whole historical reckoning, including the reckoning for Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, will be presented at the proper time, just as the Russian Bolsheviks finally presented a general reckoning to the Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries for the baiting, calumny, imprisonment and murder of workers, soldiers, and peasants.\n\n"}
{"id": "2255847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255847", "title": "Fundamental breach", "text": "Fundamental breach\n\nFundamental breach of contract is a controversial concept within the common law of contract. The doctrine was, in particular, nurtured by Lord Denning MR, but it did not find favour with the House of Lords.\n\nWhereas breach of condition is a serious breach that \"denies the plaintiff the main benefit of the contract\", fundamental breach was supposed to be even worse, with the result that any exemption clause limiting the defendant's liability would automatically become void and ineffective. Also, whereas breach of condition gives the plaintiff the option to repudiate, fundamental breach automatically discharges the entire contract.\n\nAlthough the concept caused some excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, the concept was regarded as flawed by the Law Lords, whose decision in the \"Suisse Atlantique\" substantially curtailed the doctrine, which has now been effectively \"laid to rest\" in England and Canada.. The relevant concept in English Law is repudiatory breach of contract.\n\nThe origins of the idea of fundamental breach may be traced to early cases on the doctrine of deviation. In \"Davis v. Garrett\" Tindal C.J. stated that a carrier's deviation from the agreed voyage route amounted also to a deviation from the terms of the contract, including its exceptions or limitation clauses provided by such a contract. This view was adopted in the leading cases of \"Glynn v Margetson\" and \"Leduc v Ward\". \n\nIn \"Leduc v Ward\" (1888) a vessel bound from Fiume to Dunkirk headed instead towards Glasgow, sinking in a storm in the Clyde estuary. The court held that even though the shipper may have known of the planned deviation, the parol evidence rule meant that the route described in the bill of lading was conclusive, and that the deviation was actionable, preventing the carrier from invoking the protection of the \"perils of the sea\" exemption.\n\nSimilarly, in \"Glynn v Margetson\" (1893) a vessel carrying Seville oranges from Malaga to Liverpool deviated from the agreed route, by heading first to Burriana (near Valencia). This deviation caused delay and deterioration of the perishable cargo. The carrier relied on a 'liberty clause' in the bill of lading which purported to allow the vessel 'liberty to visit any port in any order'. In the House of Lords, Lord Herschell LC declared the liberty clause to be an exemption clause in disguise, adding \"The main object of this bill of lading is the carriage of oranges from Malaga to Liverpool\". He thus established the \"main purpose rule\", holding that no exclusion clause would be allowed to cut into the main purpose of any contract. \n\n\"Tate & Lyle v Hain Steamship Company\" was a further deviation case following this approach.\n\nAlthough the 19th century cases were maritime cases, the idea of the \"main purpose\" caught on in the general law of contract after Lord Greene MR, in \"Alderslade v. Hendon Laundry Ltd.\"(1945) , labelled the fundamental term as ‘the hard core of the contract'. \n\nIn \"Karsales v Wallis\" [1956] EWCA Civ 4 a buyer inspected a car dealer's used Buick car and agreed to buy it. The car was later delivered at night, and had been towed. When the buyer inspected the car in the morning, it would not work and it was clear it had been involved in an accident, and there were other changes: its tyres had been replaced by old ones, body parts were missing, and the engine's cylinder head was detached, revealing burnt valves. This was a serious breach, but the dealer sought to rely on a clause in the contract: \"No condition or warranty that the vehicle is roadworthy or as to its age, condition or fitness for any purpose is given by the owner or implied herein.\"\n\nAlthough the clause was clear and well drafted, the Court of Appeal declared that a \"car\" was a \"vehicle capable of self-propulsion\", and accordingly this Buick was not a proper car. Following \"Glynn v Margetson\" and using its \"main purpose\" concept, the court held that the dealer was \"in breach of a fundamental obligation\" and so could not rely on any exclusion clause.\n\nThis decision was clearly fair to the buyer, and \"Karsales v Wallis\" soon became the leading case on \"fundamental breach\". As a matter of law, under the doctrine of fundamental breach of contract, exclusion clauses were deemed not to be available to a party in fundamental breach of the contract. However, all was not well, as business people felt alarmed that an agreed contract term could be set aside by a court; there seemed to be no \"certainty\".\n\nAlso, there arose some confusion as to what \"fundamental breach\" actually was. Some alleged it was a breach that went to \"the root of the contract\", a breach so fundamental it would permit the distressed party to repudiate the contract and claim damages. However, since both common law and statute already recognised that while that breach of warranty entitled a claimant only to damages, any breach of condition would entitle a claimant both repudiation and damages, it seemed that fundamental breach offered nothing new.\n\nThe matter came to a head in 1966 in the House of Lords decision \"Suisse Atlantique\". The case involved a two-year time charter to export coal, the shipowners to be paid freight dependent on tonnage of cargo carried. If laytime were exceeded, the charterers were to pay demurrage of $1,000 per day. The charterers caused huge delays and few round trips were made. Demurrage totalled only $150,000, so the owners claimed damages for their full losses, saying they should not be limited to the demurrage terms because the charterer's gross delays amounted to fundamental breach.\n\nThe House of Lords boldly held that \"Karsales v Wallis\" had overstated the law, and that whether or not a fundamental breach extinguishes any protection that the defendant might rely on was a \"question of construction\" and not a \"question of law\". Although the demurrage clause was so absurdly low that it amounted to an exemption clause, nevertheless its existence plainly showed that the parties had contemplated the possibility of delay, so delays would not amount to fundamental breach.\n\nAfter the \"Suisse Atlantique\" decision, there was a series of cases where the Court of Appeal patently ignored the House of Lords' findings. One such case was \"Harbutt's \"Plasticine\" Ltd v Wayne Tank and Pump Co Ltd\". The House of Lords was less than amused, and in the 1980 \"Photo Productions\" case they emphatically reaffirmed their decision in the \"Suisse Atlantique\". Lord Wilberforce effectively overturned the \"rule of law\" doctrine of \"Karsales v Wallis\" and instead maintained a strict \"rule of construction\" approach whereby a fundamental breach is determined by examining the full circumstances, such as the parties' intentions at the time of the contract.\n\nThese two cases (the \"Suisse Atlantique\" and \"Photo Productions\") thus form the definitive statement of the law up to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.\n\nMore recently, this law was successfully applied in two cases related to carriage of goods by sea and application of limitation clauses under the Hague-Visby Rules: \"Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd. v. Klipriver Shipping Ltd.\" and \"The Happy Ranger\"\n\nAlthough the \"Suisse Atlantique\" case has taken the sting out of the fundamental breach idea, in deviation itself little has changed. \"Glynn v Margetson\" still holds, so that not only may deviating carriers be denied the protection of exemption clauses expressly in the contract, they will also be denied the protection of implicit exemptions such as Article IV of the Hague-Visby Rules. However, given the general move in the common law away from strict liability to a standard of \"reasonable care\" (or \"due diligence\"), this may change in due course.\n\nThe doctrine of fundamental breach has been “laid to rest” by the Supreme Court of Canada in \"Tercon Contractors Ltd. v. British Columbia (Transportation and Highways).\" In its place, the court has created a three-step test to evaluate the application of exclusion clauses. The first step is to evaluate the exclusion clause in the factual context of each case to determine if it applies to the material circumstances. The second step is to evaluate if the exclusion clause was unconscionable at the time of incorporation. The final step is to evaluate whether the exclusion clause should not be enforced on public policy grounds.\n\n"}

{"id": "2255858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255858", "title": "Somatic marker hypothesis", "text": "Somatic marker hypothesis\n\nThe somatic marker hypothesis, formulated by Antonio Damasio and associated researchers, proposes that emotional processes guide (or bias) behavior, particularly decision-making.\n\n\"Somatic markers\" are feelings in the body that are associated with emotions, such as the association of rapid heartbeat with anxiety or of nausea with disgust. According to the hypothesis, somatic markers strongly influence subsequent decision-making. Within the brain, somatic markers are thought to be processed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and the amygdala. The hypothesis has been tested in experiments using the Iowa gambling task.\n\nIn economic theory, human decision-making is often modeled as being devoid of emotions, involving only logical reasoning based on cost-benefit calculations. In contrast, the somatic marker hypothesis proposes that emotions play a critical role in the ability to make fast, rational decisions in complex and uncertain situations.\n\nPatients with frontal lobe damage, such as Phineas Gage, provided the first evidence that the frontal lobes were associated with decision-making. Frontal lobe damage, particularly to the Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), results in impaired abilities to organize and plan behavior and learn from previous mistakes, without affecting intellect in terms of working memory, attention, and language comprehension and expression.\n\nvmPFC patients also have difficulty expressing and experiencing appropriate emotions. This led Antonio Damasio to hypothesize that decision-making deficits following vmPFC damage result from the inability to use emotions to help guide future behavior based on past experiences. Consequently, vmPFC damage forces those afflicted to rely on slow and laborious cost-benefit analyses for every given choice situation.\n\nAntonio Damasio () is a Portuguese-American neuroscientist. He is currently the David Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience, Psychology and Philosophy at the University of Southern California and an adjunct professor at the Salk Institute. Damasio heads the Brain and Creativity Institute, and has authored several books: his most recent work, \"Self Comes to Mind: Constructing the Conscious Brain\" (2010), explores the relationship between the brain and consciousness. Damasio’s research in neuroscience has shown that emotions play a central role in social cognition and decision-making.\n\nWhen individuals make decisions, they must assess the incentive value of the choices available to them, using cognitive and emotional processes. When the individuals face complex and conflicting choices, they may be unable to decide using only cognitive processes, which may become overloaded. Emotions, consequently, are hypothesized to guide decision-making.\n\nEmotions, as defined by Damasio, are changes in both body and brain states in response to stimuli. Physiological changes (such as muscle tone, heart rate, endocrine activity, posture, facial expression, and so forth) occur in the body and are relayed to the brain where they are transformed into an emotion that tells the individual something about the stimulus that they have encountered. Over time, emotions and their corresponding bodily changes, which are called \"somatic markers\", become associated with particular situations and their past outcomes.\n\nWhen making subsequent decisions, these somatic markers and their evoked emotions are consciously or unconsciously associated with their past outcomes, and influence decision-making in favor of some behaviors instead of others. For instance, when a somatic marker associated with a positive outcome is perceived, the person may feel happy and thereby motivated to pursue that behavior. When a somatic marker associated with the negative outcome is perceived, the person may feel sad, which acts as an internal alarm to warn the individual to avoid that course of action. These situation-specific somatic states based on, and reinforced by, past experiences help to guide behavior in favor of more advantageous choices, and therefore are adaptive.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, two distinct pathways reactivate somatic marker responses. In the first pathway, emotion can be evoked by changes in the body that are projected to the brain – called the \"body loop\". For instance, encountering a feared object like a snake may initiate the fight-or-flight response and cause fear. In the second pathway, cognitive representations of the emotions (imagining an unpleasant situation \"as-if\" you were in that particular situation) can be activated in the brain without being directly elicited by a sensory stimulus – called the \"as-if body loop\". Thus, the brain can anticipate expected bodily changes, which allows the individual to respond faster to external stimuli without waiting for an event to actually occur. The amygdala and VMPFC (a subsection of the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex or OMPFC) are essential components of this hypothesized mechanism, and therefore damage to either structure will disrupt decision-making.\n\nIn an effort to produce a simple neuropsychological tool that would assess deficits in emotional processing, decision-making, and social skills of OMPFC-lesioned individuals, Bechara and collaborators created the Iowa gambling task. The task measures a form of emotion-based learning. Studies using the gambling task have found deficits in various neurological (such as amygdala and OMPFC lesions) and psychiatric populations (such as schizophrenia, mania, and drug abusers).\n\nThe Iowa gambling task is a computerized test in which participants are presented with four decks of cards from which they repeatedly choose. Each deck contains various amounts of rewards of either $50 or $100, and occasional losses that are greater in the decks with higher rewards. The participants do not know where the penalty cards are located, and are told to pick cards that will maximize their winnings. The most profitable strategy turns out to be to choose cards only from the small reward/small penalty decks, because although the reward is smaller, the penalty is proportionally much smaller than in the high reward/high penalty decks. Over the course of a session, most healthy participants come to adopt the profitable low-penalty deck strategy. Participants with brain damage, however, are unable to determine the better deck to choose from, and continue to choose from the high reward/high penalty decks.\n\nSince the Iowa gambling task measures participants' quickness in \"developing anticipatory emotional responses to guide advantageous choices\", it is helpful in testing the somatic marker hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, somatic markers give rise to anticipation of the emotional consequences of a decision being made. Consequently, persons who perform well on the task are thought to be aware of the penalty cards and of the negative emotions associated with drawing such cards, and to realize which deck is less likely to yield a penalty.\n\nThis experiment has been used to analyze the impairments suffered by people with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which has been known to affect neural signaling of prospective rewards or punishments. Such persons perform less well on the task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to analyze the brain during the Iowa gambling task. The brain regions that were activated during the Iowa gambling task were also the ones hypothesized to be triggered by somatic markers during decision-making.\n\nDamasio has posited that the ability of humans to perform abstract thinking quickly and efficiently coincides with both the development of the ventromedial (VM) cortex and with the use of somatic markers to guide human behavior during evolution. Patients with damage to the VM cortices are more likely to engage in behaviors that negatively impact personal relationships in the distant future, but they never engage in actions that would lead to immediate harm to themselves or others. The evolution of the prefrontal cortex was associated with the ability to represent events that may occur in the future.\n\nThe somatic marker hypothesis has been applied to trying to understand risky behaviors, such as risky sexual behavior and drug addiction.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, riskier sexual behaviors are more exhilarating and pleasurable, and therefore they are more likely to stimulate repetitive engagement in such behaviors. When this idea was tested in individuals who were infected with HIV and were substance dependent, differences were found between persons who scored well in the Iowa gambling test, and those who scored poorly. The high scorers showed a correlation between the amount of distress they reported having over their HIV status, and their acceptance of risk during sexual behavior – the greater the distress, the greater the risk that these people would take. The low scorers, on the other hand, showed no such correlation. These results were interpreted as indicating that persons with intact decision-making abilities are better able to rely on past emotional experiences when weighing risks, than are persons who are deficient in such abilities, and that acceptance of risk serves to ameliorate emotional distress.\n\nDrug abusers are thought to ignore the negative consequences of addiction while seeking drugs. According to the somatic marker hypothesis, such abusers are impaired in their ability to recall and consider past unpleasant experiences when weighing whether to consider drug seeking behaviors. Researchers analyzed the neuroendocrine responses of substance-dependent individuals and healthy individuals after being shown pleasant or unpleasant images. In response to unpleasant images, drug users showed decreased levels of several neuroendocrine markers, including norepinephrine, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Addicts showed lesser responses to both pleasant and unpleasant images, suggesting that they may have a diminished emotional response. Neuroimaging studies utilizing fMRI indicate that drug-related stimuli have the ability to activate brain regions involved in emotional evaluation and reward processing. When shown a film of people smoking cocaine, cocaine users showed greater activation of the anterior cingulate cortex, the right inferior parietal lobe, and the caudate nucleus than did non-users. Conversely, the cocaine users showed lesser activation when viewing a sex film than did non-users.\n\nSome researchers believe that the use of somatic markers (i.e., afferent feedback) would be a very inefficient method of influencing behavior. Damasio's notion of the \"as-if\" experience dependent feedback route, whereby bodily responses are re-represented utilizing the somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus), also proposes an inefficient method of affecting explicit behavior. Rolls (1999) stated that; \"it would be very inefficient and noisy to place in the execution route a peripheral response, and transducers to attempt to measure that peripheral response, itself a notoriously difficult procedure\" (p. 73). Reinforcement association located in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, where the incentive value of stimuli is decoded, is sufficient to elicit emotion-based learning and to affect behavior via, for example, the orbitofrontal-striatal pathway. This process can occur via implicit or explicit processes.\n\nThe somatic marker hypothesis represents a model of how feedback from the body may contribute to both advantageous and disadvantageous decision-making in situations of complexity and uncertainty. Much of its supporting data comes from data taken from the Iowa gambling task. While the Iowa gambling task has proven to be an ecologically valid measure of decision-making impairment, there exist three assumptions that need to hold true. \n\nFirst, the claim that it assesses implicit learning as the reward/punishment design is inconsistent with data showing accurate knowledge of the task possibilities and that mechanisms such as working-memory appear to have a strong influence. Second, the claim that this knowledge occurs through preventive marker signals is not supported by competing explanations of the psychophysiology generated profile. Lastly, the claim that the impairment is due to a 'myopia for the future' is undermined by more plausible psychological mechanisms explaining deficits on the tasks such as reversal learning, risk-taking, and working-memory deficits. There may also be more variability in control performance than previously thought, thus complicating the interpretation of the findings. \n\nFurthermore, although the somatic marker hypothesis has accurately identified many of the brain regions involved in decision-making, emotion, and body-state representation, it has failed to clearly demonstrate how these processes interact at a psychological and evolutionary level. There are many experiments that could be implemented to further test the somatic marker hypothesis. One way would be to develop variants of the Iowa gambling task that control some of the methodological issues and interpretation ambiguities generated. It may be a good idea to include removing the reversal learning confound, which would make the task more difficult to consciously comprehend. Additionally, causal tests of the somatic marker hypothesis could be practiced more insistently in a greater range of populations with altered peripheral feedback, like on patients with facial paralysis. \n\nIn conclusion, the somatic marker hypothesis needs to be tested in more experiments. Until a wider range of empirical approaches are employed in order to test the somatic marker hypothesis, it appears that the framework is simply an intriguing idea that is in need of some better supporting evidence. Despite these issues, the somatic marker hypothesis and the Iowa gambling task reestablish the notion that emotion has the potential to be a benefit as well as a problem during the decision-making process in humans.\n"}
{"id": "2255873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255873", "title": "Jonathan Cheechoo", "text": "Jonathan Cheechoo\n\nJonathan Cheechoo (; Cree: ; born July 15, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger who played in the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\nDuring the 2005–06 season, he led the NHL with 56 goals and won the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy. He was the first San Jose Sharks player to win the \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy, awarded to the NHL player with the most goals in a season.\n\nDrafted by the Belleville Bulls of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in the 1997 OHL priority selection, Cheechoo had a reasonably strong rookie year in 1997–98 with 76 points (31 goals and 45 assists) in 64 games, good for third place on his team. In the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, the San Jose Sharks traded the second overall pick (used to select David Legwand) to the Nashville Predators for the third overall pick (used to select Brad Stuart) and the 29th overall pick, which they used to select Cheechoo. Most had predicted that Cheechoo would be a later-round pick, and San Jose was criticized for picking a lackluster forward who \"skated slower forwards than most players skated backwards\" instead of the highly touted Legwand.\n\nCheechoo joined the Bulls for the 1998–99 season and finished with 82 points (35 goals and 47 assists) in 63 games. Taking off in the playoffs, Cheechoo scored 30 points (15 goals and 15 assists) in 21 games. Five of those goals were scored during Game 7 of the OHL Final against the London Knights, a game the Bulls would win 9–2 to secure their first OHL Championship. Although he was now eligible for American Hockey League (AHL) assignment, San Jose chose to leave him unsigned, knowing he still had room to improve in the OHL. In the following season, Cheechoo had his best year, tallying a team-high 91 points (45 goals and 46 assists) in 66 games. Cheechoo added 17 points (5 goals and 12 assists) in 16 games during the playoffs. Notably, Cheechoo never played a full season while in juniors because of minor injuries he gained from his crash-and-bang style of play. For development, Cheechoo joined San Jose's AHL affiliate, the Kentucky Thoroughblades, in the 2000–01 season before deciding to give the NHL another try and retaining hockey agent Thayne Campbell.\n\nCheechoo had a strong rookie season with Kentucky in the AHL, scoring 66 points in 75 games. After going scoreless in the playoffs (in which he was a healthy scratch for two games), Cheechoo rebounded with 46 points (21 goals and 25 assists) in 53 games (he missed games due to a leg injury).\n\nIn 2002–03, after scoring seven points (three goals and four assists) in nine games with the Cleveland Barons (the relocated Kentucky Thoroughblades franchise), Cheechoo was recalled to San Jose to help revitalize the struggling team. Playing mostly on the third and fourth lines, Cheechoo had a modest 16 points (9 goals and 7 assists) in 66 games.\n\nHis hard work paid off, as Cheechoo had 47 points in 81 games in 2003–04. Playing alongside Mike Ricci and Scott Thornton, Cheechoo had two mentors who taught Cheechoo how to be defensively responsible. Before the Calgary Flames eliminated San Jose in the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs, Cheechoo had 10 points in 17 games. During the NHL lock-out, Cheechoo played with HV71 of the Swedish Elitserien and scored 5 goals in 20 games.\n\nIn the 2005–06 season, Cheechoo's offensive statistics took off, netting a franchise record 56 goals and 93 points. Much of Cheechoo's success was augmented by the Sharks acquisition of superstar Joe Thornton in late November. Before the trade, Cheechoo had 15 points (7 goals and 8 assists) in 24 games. In the 57 games after the trade, Cheechoo had 78 points (49 goals and 29 assists). Due to his uptake in goal scoring, Cheechoo became the first Sharks player to win the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy and the second aboriginal player to score more than 50 goals in a season.\n\nIn 2006, Cheechoo signed a five-year contract extension worth US$15 million, paying him US$2.5 million the first two years, US$3 million the third year and US$3.5 million the last two years.\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, Cheechoo got off to a slow start as he, Joe Thornton and newly acquired power forward Mark Bell failed to click. However, after a struggling Bell was demoted to the press box in favor of young speedster Milan Michalek, Cheechoo picked it up somewhat, finishing the season with 37 goals and 69 points in 76 games. During the 2007 off-season, Cheechoo required double hernia surgery to repair injuries he amassed during the Sharks' playoff run.\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, Cheechoo's production dropped to 23 goals. Cheechoo's production dropped further the following season, where he scored just 12 goals.\n\nOn September 12, 2009, Cheechoo was traded by the Sharks (along with Michalek and a second-round draft pick) to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Dany Heatley and a fifth-round pick. On February 12, 2010, Cheechoo was placed on waivers by the Senators after they acquired Matt Cullen from the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nOn February 13, 2010, he cleared waivers and was reassigned to the Binghamton Senators, Ottawa's AHL affiliate. He was recalled in the playoffs and played one game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. On June 28, he was again placed on waivers by the Senators. Cheechoo, who was heading into the final year of a five-year contract signed with San Jose in 2006, was reportedly owed $3.5 million for the 2010–11 season. On June 29, the Senators bought out the final year of his contract, making him a free agent.\n\nFollowing his buy out, Cheechoo was invited to the Dallas Stars training camp on September 4, 2010. He was released from the tryout 22 days later, on September 26, following his appearance in two pre-season games where he failed to register a point and posted a −2 rating. Despite his efforts, Dallas felt Cheechoo could not out perform their current players and therefore released him so he would have the opportunity to join another team.\n\nOn October 5, 2010, Cheechoo returned to the Sharks organization, signing a professional try-out contract with their AHL affiliate, the Worcester Sharks, to re-unite with his first professional head coach Roy Sommer, who previously coached him with the Kentucky Thoroughblades.\n\nOn July 12, 2011, Cheechoo was signed by the St. Louis Blues to a one-year, two-way contract. While playing with the Blues' AHL affiliate, the Peoria Rivermen, Cheechoo earned his 500th career professional point on November 27 against the Chicago Wolves.\n\nA free agent upon the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Cheechoo was belatedly signed to a professional try-out contract with the Oklahoma City Barons of the AHL during the midpoint of the 2012–13 season on January 20, 2013.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Cheechoo left North America and signed a one-year contract with Croatian club, Medveščak Zagreb of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).\n\nIn May 2014, Cheechoo signed a two-year deal with KHL club Dinamo Minsk from Belarus. In 2016, he signed a one-year deal with Slovan Bratislava. Cheechoo was selected for the 2017 KHL All-Star game.\n\nOn March 6, 2018, Cheechoo officially announced his retirement. He was recognized at the SAP Center in San Jose prior to the Sharks' game against the Calgary Flames on March 24, 2018. After Cheechoo announced his retirement, Sharks general manager Doug Wilson commented about Cheechoo's background; Wilson talked about the fact that he was a player who was able to have great success from a remote area of Canada.\n\nCheechoo is a member of the Cree First Nations tribe from Moose Factory, Ontario. When he was young, Cheechoo did not believe he would play in the NHL; instead, he believed that he would follow in the footsteps of his grandfather and would become a trapper and hunter for the Cree. Over time, Cheechoo developed into a strong hockey player and, at age 14, left his home after being told he would need to in order to develop his hockey skills. Cheechoo moved to Timmins, Ontario, around 300 kilometres away from his home, to play bantam hockey. Living so far from home Cheechoo was homesick, he found it very difficult to have to leave his close family at such a young age. Cheechoo has said he had a very strong support system when he was deciding to pursue hockey. His success was a highlight for Moose Factory, as shown by the 120 individuals who left Moose Factory to support him when he went 29th overall in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nGrowing up in a small town, Cheechoo enjoyed the tight-knit nature of the town and expressed thanks for the high level of support he had from the people he grew up with. Cheechoo's childhood was very reminiscent of a traditional Cree upbringing and has said his favorite things to do when he was young was to hunt and fish with his grandfather, George Cheechoo.\n\nIn his youth, Cheechoo was involved in the Little Native Hockey League, a tournament which gives aboriginal youth an outlet to play hockey. During the 25th Little Native Hockey Tournament, Cheechoo sat as the captain of the team and won the tournament. Cheechoo has described his involvement with the organization as being a positive aspect of his hockey career. Cheechoo sat as the Honorary Chair during the 46th annual event which took place in March 2017.\n\nCheechoo has been known to go out of his way and talk to children and interact with those who admire him. Cheechoo is seen as a sport role model for aboriginal youth in hockey, with his involvement in the Little Native Hockey League being a source of inspiration for those currently competing in the tournament and wishing to achieve the same level of success.\n\n"}

{"id": "2255884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255884", "title": "Battle of Tarakan (1945)", "text": "Battle of Tarakan (1945)\n\nThe Battle of Tarakan was the first stage in the Borneo campaign of 1945. It began with an amphibious landing by Allied forces on 1 May, code-named Operation Oboe One; the Allied ground forces were drawn mainly from the Australian 26th Brigade, but included a small element of Netherlands East Indies personnel. The main objective of the landing was capture of the island's airfield. While the battle ended with success for the Allied forces over the Japanese defenders, this victory is generally regarded as having not justified its costs. The airfield was so heavily damaged that it ultimately could not be repaired in time to make it operational for other phases of the Allied campaign in Borneo.\n\nTarakan is a triangle-shaped island off the coast of Borneo. The island is roughly long from its northernmost point to the southern tip and wide towards the north of the island. The small island of Sadau is located about off Tarakan's west coast. Almost all of Tarakan's coastline is swampy, and in 1945 mangroves on the northern half of the island stretched to inland. The coastal mangroves in the southern portion of the island were narrower. Inland from the swamps, most of central Tarakan comprised a series of steep and densely forested hills just over high. Tarakan is located three degrees north of the equator and has a tropical climate. The maximum temperature for most days is about , and relative humidity is consistently high at about 90 percent.\n\nIn 1945, Tarakan Town was the main settlement of the island. This town was located inland, and was separated from the south-west coast by several small hills covered in low vegetation. Four piers used to dock oil tankers were located on this coastline at the settlement of Lingkas, and were connected to Tarakan Town by three surfaced roads. Tarakan airfield was located about north-west of Tarakan Town. Of the island's two oilfields, Sesanip Oilfield was located at the north-east edge of the airfield while the larger Djoeata or Juata Oilfield was to the north. The village of Djoeata was located on Tarakan's north-west coast and linked to Djoeata Oilfield by a track.\n\nPrior to World War II, Tarakan formed part of the Netherlands East Indies (NEI) and was an important oil production centre. The island's two oilfields produced 80,000 barrels of oil per month in 1941. Securing Tarakan's oilfields formed one of Japan's early objectives during the Pacific War. Japanese forces landed on the island's east coast on 11 January 1942 and defeated the small Dutch garrison in two days of fighting in which half the defenders were killed. While the oilfields were successfully sabotaged by the Dutch before their surrender, Japanese engineers were able to swiftly restore them to production and 350,000 barrels were extracted each month by early 1944.\n\nFollowing the Dutch surrender, Tarakan's 5,000 inhabitants suffered under Japan's occupation policies. The large number of troops stationed on the island caused food shortages and many civilians suffered from malnutrition as a result. The Japanese authorities brought 600 labourers to Tarakan from Java. The Japanese also forced an estimated 300 Javanese women to work as \"comfort women\" on Tarakan after enticing them to travel with false offers of clerical and clothes-making jobs.\n\nTarakan's value to the Japanese evaporated with the rapid advance of Allied forces into the area during 1944. The last Japanese oil tanker left Tarakan in July 1944, and heavy Allied air raids later in the year destroyed the island's oil production and storage facilities. Hundreds of Indonesian civilians may have also been killed by these raids. The Allies also laid mines near Tarakan, which, combined with patrols by air and naval units, prevented Japanese merchant vessels and transports from docking at the island. \n\nIn line with the island's declining importance, the Japanese garrison on Tarakan was reduced in early 1945. One of the two infantry battalions stationed on the island (the 454th Independent Infantry Battalion) was withdrawn to Balikpapan. This battalion was destroyed by the Australian 7th Division in July during the Battle of Balikpapan.\n\nThe primary objective for the Allied attack on Tarakan (code-named \"Oboe One\") was to secure and develop the island's airstrip so that it could be used to provide air cover for subsequent landings in Brunei, Labuan and Balikpapan. The secondary objective for the operation was to secure Tarakan's oilfields and bring them into operation as a source of oil for the Allied forces in the theatre. The 3rd Company, Technical Battalion, KNIL was responsible for this.\nThe 9th Division and 26th Brigade headquarters were responsible for planning the invasion of Tarakan. This work began in early March when both units had arrived at Morotai, and the final plans were completed on 24 April. The planners' work was hampered by poor working conditions and difficulties in communicating with General MacArthur's General Headquarters at Leyte. As part of the planning process each of Tarakan's hills was assigned a code name (for instance \"Margy\" and \"Sykes\"); during the Australian Army's campaigns in New Guinea geographic features had been named on an ad-hoc basis, and it was hoped that selecting names prior to the battle would improve the precision of subsequent planning and communications.\nThe Allied plans anticipated that Tarakan would be secured quickly. It was expected that the operation would involve a short fight for the airfield followed by a 'consolidation' phase during which the island's airfield and port would be developed to support Allied operations. The planners did not foresee significant fighting in Tarakan's interior, and no plans were developed for operations in areas other than the landing beaches, Tarakan Town and airfield. The planners did, however, correctly anticipate that the Japanese would make their main stand in an area other than the invasion beach and would not be capable of mounting a large counterattack.\n\nThe Allied plans also expected that Tarakan would be transformed into a major base within days of the landing. Under the pre-invasion planning it was intended that a wing of fighter aircraft would be based at Tarakan six days after the landing and this force would be expanded to include an attack wing nine days later and staging facilities for a further four squadrons of aircraft within 21 days of the landing. It was also expected that the 26th Brigade Group and its supporting beach group would be ready to leave Tarakan by 21 May and the RAAF units could be redeployed in mid-June after providing support for the landing at Balikpapan.\n\nThe Allied planners possessed detailed intelligence on Tarakan and its defenders. This intelligence had been gathered from a variety of sources which included signals intelligence, photographic reconnaissance flights and Dutch colonial officials. Tarakan was the Australian Services Reconnaissance Department's (SRD) first priority from November 1944. Prior to the invasion, I Corps requested that the SRD provide intelligence on Japanese positions in northern and central Tarakan. A five-man strong party landed on the island on the night of 25/26 April and successfully reconnoitered the defences on Tarakan's north coast, though the operative who was assigned to the centre of the island became lost and did not reach this area. The SRD operatives withdrew from Tarakan on the night of 29/30 April and landed on the mainland of Borneo. They were unable to transmit the intelligence they had collected, however, as their radio set malfunctioned. Members of the party eventually landed within the Allied beachhead on Tarakan on 3 May to report to the 26th Brigade, but Whitehead was disappointed with the results of this operation and made no further use of SRD during the battle.\n\nThe Allied force responsible for capturing Tarakan was centred around the very experienced Australian 26th Brigade Group of nearly 12,000 soldiers. The 26th Brigade had been formed in 1940 and had seen action in North Africa and New Guinea. The brigade's infantry component was the 2/23rd, 2/24th and 2/48th Battalions, also with much war experience. These battalions were joined by the 2/4th Commando Squadron and the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion, which fought as infantry in this battle. The brigade group also included the 2/7th Field Regiment equipped with 24 25-pounder guns, a squadron from the 2/9th Armoured Regiment operating 18 Matilda tanks, a company of the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion, the 53rd Composite Anti-Aircraft Regiment and two engineer field squadrons. These combat units were supported by a large number of logistics and medical units, including the 2nd Beach Group whose role was to land supplies from the invasion fleet. While the 26th Brigade Group greatly outnumbered the known strength of Tarakan's Japanese defenders, the Allies committed this large force as their previous experience indicated that it would be difficult to defeat the Japanese force if it retreated into Tarakan's rugged interior.\n\nThe 26th Brigade Group was supported by Allied air and naval units. The air units were drawn from the Australian First Tactical Air Force (1 TAF) and United States Thirteenth Air Force and included fighter and bomber squadrons. The naval force was drawn from the United States Seventh Fleet and included several Royal Australian Navy warships and transports. Since the main objective of attacking Tarakan was to use the island's airstrip, the invasion force also included a large number of Royal Australian Air Force ground units, including No. 61 Airfield Construction Wing comprising No. 1 and No. 8 Airfield Construction Squadrons.\n\nThe force which landed on Tarakan included nearly a thousand United States and Dutch troops. The U.S. troops included the U.S. Army engineers who manned the invasion force's LCMs and LCVPs and the U.S. Army's 727th Amphibian Tractor Battalion, Co. A, who manned the LVTs and United States Navy Seabee detachments aboard the Landing Ship Tanks. The Dutch forces were organised into a company of Ambonese infantry commanded by Dutch officers and a civil affairs unit.\n\nAt the time of the Allied landing, the Japanese force on Tarakan numbered 2,200 men drawn from the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy. The largest unit was the 740-man strong 455th Independent Infantry Battalion which was commanded by Major Tadao Tokoi (). 150 Army support troops were also on Tarakan. The Navy's contribution to Tarakan's garrison comprised 980 seamen commanded by Commander Kaoru Kaharu. The main naval unit was the 600-strong 2nd Naval Garrison Force. This naval unit was trained to fight as infantry and operated several coastal defence guns. The 350 Japanese civilian oil workers on Tarakan were also expected to fight in the event of an Allied attack. The Japanese force included about 50 Indonesians serving in a home guard unit. Major Tokoi directed the overall defence of Tarakan, though relations between the Army and Navy were poor.\n\nThe Japanese forces were concentrated around Lingkas, Tarakan's main port and the site of the only beaches suitable for landing troops. These defenders had spent the months before the invasion constructing defensive positions and laying mines. These fixed defences were used extensively during the battle, with Japanese tactics being focused on tenaciously defending pre-prepared positions. The Japanese did not conduct any large counter-attacks, and most offensive actions were limited to small parties of raiders which attempted to infiltrate the Australian lines.\n\nThe Japanese force on Tarakan was warned of the impending invasion in April, before the Allies began their pre-invasion bombardment of the island. The island's commander received a radio signal warning him of imminent attack, and the commander of Tarakan's oil depot was ordered to destroy the oil wells on 15 April. It is possible that this warning may have been issued as a result of a security leak from either the Chinese Republican Army's representative to Australia or MacArthur's headquarters. This did not have any effect on the subsequent battle, however, as the Japanese had been preparing defences to resist invasion for several months and the Japanese were aware of the large Allied force which was being assembled at Morotai to attack Borneo.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the invasion force the Japanese garrison on Tarakan and Borneo was subjected to intensive air and naval attacks from 12 April to 29 April. The RAAF and USAAF also mounted air attacks against Japanese bases in China, French Indochina and the NEI to suppress Japanese air units throughout the region. These attacks destroyed all Japanese aircraft in the Tarakan area. The aerial bombing of Tarakan increased in intensity five days before the landing. These attacks were focused on the areas adjoining the planned landing beaches at Lingkas and sought to neutralise the Japanese defences in these areas. The oil storage tanks at Lingkas were a key objective as it was feared that the oil in these tanks could be ignited and used against Allied troops. These bombardments forced much of Tarakan's civilian population to flee inland. At least 100 civilians were killed or wounded.\n\nThe Tarakan attack force was assembled at Morotai during March and April 1945. The 26th Brigade Group was transported from Australia to Morotai by United States Army transports and arrived in mid-April and began to prepare their equipment for an amphibious landing. Due to a shortage of shipping all units were ordered to leave non-essential vehicles at Morotai when they began to embark onto assault transports on 20 April. The commander of the 1st Tactical Air Force attempted to resist this order, but was over-ridden by his superior officer Air Vice Marshal William Bostock. Most units were embarked by 22 April and the assault troops practiced landing operations for several days. A small convoy of ships carrying a force ordered to capture Sadau Island off the coast of Tarakan left Morotai on 26 April, and the main invasion convoy of 150 ships sailed the next day.\nDue to the need to clear both the large number of naval mines which had been laid around Tarakan and the extensive beach obstacles at Lingkas, the Allies did not attempt a surprise landing. A group of United States Navy minesweepers and destroyers arrived off Tarakan on 27 April and began clearing mines, most of which had been originally laid by Allied aircraft. This operation was completed by 1 May at a cost of two small minesweepers damaged. USN PT boats also arrived off Tarakan on 28 April and illuminated and strafed the invasion beaches at night to prevent the Japanese from repairing their beach defences. The PT boats also attacked seven small Japanese freighters and luggers which were found anchored at Lingkas, sinking or damaging all but one of them.\n\nOn 30 April, the 2/4th Commando Squadron and the 57th Battery of the 2/7th Field Regiment were landed on the nearby Sadau Island in order to support the engineers tasked with clearing the obstacles off the invasion beaches. This force rapidly secured the undefended island. The landing on Sadau Island was the first time Australian soldiers had landed on non-Australian territory in the Pacific since late 1941 (Australian participation in the New Guinea Campaign from 1942 onwards was limited to the Australian portion of New Guinea). The only Allied losses in this operation were aboard , which was damaged when she struck a mine while supporting the landing.\n\nThe task of clearing the beach obstacles at Lingkas was assigned to the 2/13th Field Company. These defences comprised rows of barbed wire, wooden posts and steel rails which extended 125 yards from the beach. At 11:00 on 30 April, eight parties of engineers went forward in LVTs and landing craft to clear the obstacles. The engineers were supported by the guns on Sadau Island and Allied warships and aircraft. Operating under Japanese fire the engineers cleared all the obstacles obstructing the landing beaches. While heavy casualties had been expected, the 2/13th completed their task without loss.\n\nThe main invasion force arrived by sea off Tarakan in the early hours of 1 May. Supported by a heavy air and naval bombardment, the 2/23rd Battalion and the 2/48th Battalion made an amphibious landing at about 08:00. The 2/23rd Battalion disembarked from American LVTs into deep mud at \"Green Beach\" on the southern flank of the beachhead, and overcame several small Japanese positions in the hills around Lingkas. At nightfall it dug in along the main road to Tarakan Town (which had been designated the \"Glenelg Highway\" by the Australian planners). The 2/48th Battalion had a much easier landing at \"Red Beach\" on the northern end of the beachhead with most troops disembarking from their LVTs near dry land. The battalion pushed north along the \"Anzac Highway\" and nearby hills, and rapidly secured a number of pillboxes behind the beach as well as the oil storage tanks. By the end of the day the 2/48th held positions in the hills to the west of Tarakan Town. The 2/24th Battalion also began landing on Red Beach from 9.20 am, and spent most of the day in reserve. The unit received orders to advance north along the Anzac Highway late in the afternoon, but did not encounter any opposition. By nightfall the Australian beachhead extended for along the shore and up to inland. However, Japanese snipers were active within this perimeter during the night of 1/2 May, and the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion (which formed the main unit of the 2nd Beach Group) fought several small battles with isolated Japanese forces. Allied casualties were lighter than expected, with 11 men killed and 35 wounded. The light Japanese resistance was attributed to the heavy pre-landing bombardment forcing Tarakan's defenders to abandon the formidable defences at Lingkas.\n\nWhile the infantry were successful in securing a beachhead, the landing was hampered by the poor beach conditions. Many Australian vehicles became bogged in Lingkas Beach's soft mud, and seven LSTs were stranded after their commanders misjudged the ships' beachings. The small amount of solid ground within the beachhead lead to severe congestion and resulted in none of 2/7th Field Regiment's guns being brought into action until the afternoon of the landing. The congestion was made worse by much of the RAAF ground force being landed on 1 May with large numbers of vehicles. The seven LSTs were not refloated until 13 May.\n\nAfter securing the beachhead, the 26th Brigade Group advanced east into Tarakan Town and north towards the airstrip. The Australians encountered increasingly determined Japanese resistance as they moved inland. The task of capturing Tarakan's airstrip was assigned to the 2/24th Battalion. The Battalion's initial attack on the airstrip on the night of 2 May was delayed when the Japanese set off large explosive charges, and the airstrip was not secured until 5 May. While the capture of the airfield achieved the 26th Brigade Group's main task, the Japanese still held Tarakan's rugged interior.\n\nDuring the first week of the invasion, 7,000 Indonesian refugees passed into the advancing Australian lines. This was a larger number than had been expected, and the refugees, many of whom were in poor health, overwhelmed the Dutch civil affairs unit. Despite the devastation caused by the Allied bombardment and invasion, most of the civilians welcomed the Australians as liberators. Hundreds of Indonesian civilians later worked as labourers and porters for the Allied force.\n\nGeneral Thomas Blamey, the commander of the Australian Military Forces, made an inspection tour of Tarakan on 8 May. During a meeting with Whitehead, Blamey directed that the 26th Brigade Group should \"proceed in a deliberate manner\" in clearing the rest of the island now that the main objectives of the invasion had been completed.\n\nIn order to secure the island and protect the airstrip from attack, the 26th Brigade Group was forced to clear the Japanese from Tarakan's heavily forested hills. Approximately 1,700 Japanese troops were dug into positions in the north and centre of the island. These positions were protected by booby traps and mines. While attacking these positions necessarily entailed costly infantry fighting, the Australian troops made heavy use of their available artillery and air support to minimise casualties. The Australian tanks could only provide limited support to the infantry as Tarakan's thick jungle, swamps and steep hills often confined their movement to tracks and roads. As a result, tanks generally could not be used to spearhead attacks, and their role was limited to providing supporting fire for infantry assaults, with artillery being the preferred source of direct support.\n\nThe 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion and the NEI company were assigned responsibility for securing the south-eastern portion of Tarakan. The pioneers began advancing east of Tarakan Town on 7 May but encountered unexpectedly strong Japanese resistance. From 10 May, the battalion was halted at the 'Helen' feature, which was defended by about 200 Japanese troops. On 12 May Corporal John Mackey was killed after capturing three Japanese machine gun posts. Mackey was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for this act. During the fighting at 'Helen' B-24 Liberator heavy bombers were used for close air support for the first time, with P-38 Lightning fighters dropping napalm immediately after the bombing. This combination proved particularly effective, and became the standard form of air support requested by the Australians. The Japanese force withdrew from 'Helen' on 14 May after suffering approximately 100 casualties, and the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion reached Tarakan's eastern shore on 16 May. The battalion suffered 20 killed and 46 wounded in this operation. During this period the NEI company secured the remainder of southern Tarakan, and encountered little resistance during its advance.\n\nThe United States and Australian navies continued to support the invasion once the landing was complete. USN PT boats sank at least a dozen small craft off Tarakan and in rivers on the coast of Borneo between 1 and 10 May. The PT boats carried Netherlands Indies Civil Administration interpreters on most patrols who interrogated natives to gather information on Japanese movements. The Japanese battery at Cape Djoeata on Tarakan's north coast was also knocked out by USS \"Douglas A. Munro\" on 23 May.\n\nThe Japanese garrison was gradually destroyed, with the survivors abandoning their remaining positions in the hills and withdrawing to the north of the island on 14 June. On this day 112 Chinese and Indonesian labourers left the Japanese-held area with a note from a senior Japanese officer asking that they be well treated. While Radio Tokyo announced that Tarakan had fallen on 15 June, the last organised Japanese resistance was encountered on 19 June and Whitehead did not declare the island secure until 21 June.\n\nWhile the infantry of the 26th Brigade Group fought the Japanese in the hills, the RAAF engineers of No. 61 Airfield Construction Wing were engaged in a desperate effort to bring Tarakan's airstrip into operation. As the airstrip had been heavily damaged by pre-invasion bombing and lay in marshy terrain it proved much more difficult to repair than had been expected, and it took eight weeks and not the expected single week to restore the strip to a usable state. Extensive use was made of Marston Mat, interlocking steel plates laid down like matting. Remnants of the plates still exist in the car park at Tarakan airport.\n\nWhile the airstrip was finally opened on 28 June, this was too late for it to play any role in supporting the landings in Brunei or Labuan (10 June), or the landings at Balikpapan. However No. 78 Wing RAAF was based on Tarakan from 28 June and flew in support of the Balikpapan operation until the end of the war.\n\nEfforts to restart production at Tarakan's oilfields were delayed by serious damage to the facilities and Japanese holdouts, and they did not become operational until after the war.\n\nFollowing the end of organised resistance the surviving Japanese on Tarakan split into small parties which headed to the north and east of the island. The 26th Brigade Group's main combat units were allocated sections of Tarakan which they swept for Japanese. Many Japanese attempted to cross the strait separating Tarakan from the mainland but were intercepted by Allied naval patrols. Allied troops also searched for Japanese on Bunyu Island, fifteen miles north-east of Tarakan.\n\nFrom the first week of July the surviving Japanese became short of food and attempted to return to their old positions in the centre of the island and raid Australian positions in search of food. As their hunger increased more Japanese surrendered. The Australian units continued to patrol in search of Japanese until the end of the war, with several Japanese being killed or surrendering each day. These operations cost the 26th Brigade Group a further 36 casualties between June 21 and August 15. Approximately 300 Japanese soldiers evaded the Allied patrols, and surrendered at the end of the war in mid-August.\n\nThe 26th Brigade Group remained on Tarakan as an occupation force until 27 December 1945, though most of its units were disbanded in October. The Brigade's headquarters returned to Australia in early 1946 and was formally disbanded at Brisbane in January 1946.\n\nTarakan's oilfields were swiftly repaired and brought back into production. Engineers and technicians arrived shortly after the Allied landing and the first oil pump was restored on 27 June. By October the island's oilfields were producing 8,000 barrels per day and providing employment for many Tarakanese civilians.\n\nThe Allied units committed to the battle carried out their tasks with \"skill and professionalism\". In summing up the operation Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that \"altogether this was a very well conducted amphibious operation which attained its objectives with minimum loss\". The Battle of Tarakan emphasised the importance of combined arms warfare, and especially the need for infantry to cooperate with and be supported by tanks, artillery and engineers during jungle warfare.\n\nDespite Morison's judgement, the 26th Brigade Group's casualties were high in comparison to the other landings in the Borneo campaign. The Brigade suffered more than twice the casualties the 9th Division's other two Brigades suffered during their operations in North Borneo and 23 more fatalities than the 7th Division incurred at Balikpapan. The 26th Brigade Group's higher losses may be attributable to Tarakan's garrison not being able to withdraw as the garrisons in North Borneo and Balikpapan did.\n\nThe landing force's achievements were nullified by the fact that the island's airfield could not be brought into action. The faulty intelligence assessment which led the RAAF planners to believe that the airfield could be repaired represented a major failing. Moreover, the RAAF's performance at Tarakan was often poor. This performance may have resulted from the low morale prevalent in many units and the 'Morotai Mutiny' disrupting 1 TAF's leadership.\n\nAs with the rest of the Borneo campaign, the Australian operations on Tarakan remain controversial. Debate continues over whether the campaign was a meaningless \"sideshow\", or whether it was justified in the context of the planned operations to both invade Japan and liberate the rest of the Netherlands East Indies, which were both scheduled to begin in 1946. The Australian official historian Gavin Long's judgement that \"the results achieved did not justify the cost of the Tarakan operation\" is in accordance with the generally held view on the battle.\n\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman for the Houston Astros (1966, 1968), San Diego Padres (1969–74), Detroit Tigers (1975), Montreal Expos (1975–76), and Oakland Athletics (1976).\n\nBorn in St. Louis, Missouri, Colbert was signed by his hometown St. Louis Cardinals as an amateur free agent in . Colbert saw some action with the Houston Astros in and before being selected by the San Diego Padres in the 1968 expansion draft. In , the Padres' inaugural season, and his first full season in the big leagues, Colbert hit 24 home runs, which led the club, and drove in 66 runs while batting .255. He was a National League All-Star from 1971 to 1973. Colbert's best day in the majors was August 1, 1972, when he slammed 5 home runs - one of two players to have done so, Stan Musial being the other in 1954 - and drove in 13 runs in a doubleheader, breaking the record of 11 runs batted in. This helped the Padres sweep the Atlanta Braves, 9-0 and 11-7. Coincidentally, a young Colbert had attended the game in which Musial originally set the single-day home run record.\n\nColbert's .508 slugging percentage, 87 runs, 286 total bases, 38 home runs, 111 RBIs, 70 walks, 67 extra-base hits, 14 intentional walks, and 14.8 at bats per home run helped him finish eighth in voting for the NL MVP in 1972. He finished second only to the Cincinnati Reds' Johnny Bench (40) in home runs that year. His 111 RBIs also set a record that still stands for driving in the highest percentage of his team's runs. Throughout his career with the Padres from 1969 to , he often was the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal San Diego lineup. After hitting .207 in 1974, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a three-way deal. Colbert also played for the Montreal Expos in parts of 1975 and 1976, but spent much of 1976 in the minor leagues before resurfacing very briefly with the Oakland Athletics at the end of the season. He attended spring training with the expansion Toronto Blue Jays in 1977, but back problems forced his retirement at 30.\n\nColbert played on nine consecutive last-place teams, from 1968–1976. Only the teams at the very start and end of Colbert's career escaped the cellar: Colbert went 0-for-7 for the 1966 Houston Astros (who finished in eight place in a 10-team league), and 0-for-5 for the 1976 Oakland A's (who finished second in their division.) In 1975, Colbert played for \"two\" last place teams: Detroit and Montreal.\n\nColbert was the first real star for the Padres, and remains the San Diego Padres all-time home run leader with 163. He was inducted as part of the inaugural class of the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nIn 10 seasons covering 1004 games, Colbert compiled a .243 batting average (833-for-3422) with 481 runs, 141 doubles, 25 triples, 173 home runs, 520 RBI, 383 base on balls, 902 strikeouts, .322 on-base percentage and .451 slugging percentage.

He was also known by the \"kunya\" Abu Abdul Rahman\"'.\n\nAbdullah ibn Mas'ud was born in Mecca in about 594 a son of Masud ibn Ghafil and Umm Abd bint Abdwadd, both of whom were from the Tamim tribe, believed to be slaves, or otherwise of low social status. However, Umm Abd's mother, Hind bint Al-Harith, was from the Zuhra clan of the Quraysh, and Masud made an alliance with her brother.\n\nAbdullah had a brother, Utba, and at least two wives in Muhammad's lifetime. One was Rayta bint Abdullah, a craftswoman who supported Abdullah and their child through her handcrafts. The other was Zaynab bint Abdullah from the Thaqif tribe with whom he had several daughters. He specified in his will that none of his daughters should be married off without their own knowledge. He also had a son named Abdul Rahman.\n\nHe is described as a thin, short man with very dark skin, and smooth hair reaching to his shoulders. Abdullah wore white clothes, and could be recognized in the dark by his distinctive, high-quality perfume. He was reported to be sociable and willing to speak out to put people at ease. In his character and goals, he was said to be the person \"most like Muhammad\".\n\nIbn Masʿūd was an early follower of Islam, having converted before 616. He appears nineteenth on Ibn Ishaq's list of people who were converted by Abu Bakr.\n\nAs a youth, he worked as a shepherd for Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt. He first met Muhammad and Abu Bakr while watching his flocks when they were \"fleeing from the idolators\". They asked him for milk, but Abdullah said he could not steal from his employer. According to Masʿūd, Muhammad then asked for an unmated ewe and stroked its udder, whereupon milk poured out. Abdullah immediately asked to be taught \"some of these words,\" and Muhammad began to teach him the Qur'an. Abdullah later said that he learned 70 \"suras\" from Muhammad.\n\nLater his mother and brother also converted to Islam.\n\nAround 614 the Quraysh began a campaign to suppress Islam through the oppression of Muslims of lower social status. Abdullah, as a foreigner whose allies had withdrawn their protection, was vulnerable to this persecution. Abu Jahl—one of the high-status leaders among the Quraysh—once \"clawed at him and punched him\".\n\nThe Muslims remarked one day that the Quraysh had never heard the Qur'an being recited clearly, and that someone needed to make them listen to it. Abdullah volunteered. His friends reminded him that he had no protector and therefore the crowds might attack him, but Abdullah replied, \"Allah will protect me.\" He stood in front of the Kaaba and began to recite Surah Al-Rehman from the Qur'an. When the Quraysh realized that he was reciting Muhammad's teaching, they began to hit his face, but he continued to recite. He returned to the Muslims with the bruises on his face, saying, \"I have never despised Allah's enemies more than I do now, and if you like I will go and do the same thing tomorrow.\" The Muslims told him that he had already done enough, \"for you have made them listen to what they don't want to hear\".\n\nAbdullah and his brother Utba were among those who emigrated to Abyssinia in 616. Abdullah returned to Mecca in 619 with Abdulrahman ibn Awf.\n\nWhen the Muslims emigrated to Medina in 622, Abdullah lodged with Muadh ibn Jabal or Saad ibn Khaythama. One tradition states that Muhammad made a pact of brotherhood between Abdullah and Muadh ibn Jabal; but according to another, Abdullah's brother in Islam was Al-Zubayar ibn Al-Awwam. When land in Medina was allocated to the immigrants, the Zuhra clan was given an area behind the mosque, which included plots for Abdullah and his brother Utba.\n\nOutsiders perceived Abdullah and his mother as members of Muhammad's household. He worked as a personal servant, taking care of Muhammad's bedding, toothbrush, sandals and traveling hygiene. \"He used to screen him when he bathed and wake him when he slept and walk with him in a wild land.\" He was said to be the \"keeper of secrets\". Muhammad once told him to climb a tree and bring him a twig. The companions laughed at how thin Abdullah's legs were. Muhammad said: \"Why are you laughing? Abdullah's foot will be heavier than Mount Uhud in the scales on the Day of Resurrection.\"\n\nMuhammad recognized Abdullah as one of the four foremost experts on the Qur'an. He once asked him to recite; when Abdullah protested, \"Should I recite it to you when you are the one to whom it was sent down and revealed?\" Muhammad replied, \"I love to hear it from someone else.\" Abdullah then recited it until Muhammad wept.\n\nAbdullah fought at the Battle of Badr. After the battle, Muhammad ordered the warriors to search among the corpses for his enemy Abu Jahl, who could be recognised by a distinctive scar on his knee.\n\nAbdullah found Abu Jahl \"at his last gasp\" with his leg cut off. He seized his beard and asked, \"Are you Abu Jahl?\" Abu Jahl replied, \"Can there be a man superior to the one you have killed or one whom his own folk has killed?\" Abdullah then placed his foot on Abu Jahl's neck, and asked, \"Allah's enemy, has Allah put you to shame?\" Abu Jahl replied, \"How has he shamed me? Am I anything more than a man whom you have killed? Tell me how the battle went.\" Abdullah told him that the Muslims had won. Abu Jahl responded, \"You have climbed high, you little shepherd!\" Then Abdullah struck off his head. He brought it to Muhammad, proclaiming, \"This is the head of Allah's enemy Abu Jahl!\".\n\nAbdullah also fought at the Battle of Uhud, the Battle of the Trench and \"all the battles,\" including Tabuk. Twenty years later, he said he wished he had died at Tabuk.\n\nAfter the death of Muhammad, Abdullah ibn Masud became the eighth-most prominent transmitter of \"hadith\" with a total of 848 narrations. Umar called him \"a box full of knowledge\". The following traditions are among those attributed to him.\n\nI asked Allah's Messenger which deed was the best. He replied: \"Prayer at its appointed hour.\" I said: \"Then what?\" He replied: \"Kindness to the parents.\" I said: \"Then what?\" He replied: \"\"Jihad\" in the cause of Allah.\" And I would not have ceased asking more questions but out of regard.\n\nA man said: \"Allah's Messenger, which offense is the most grievous in Allah's eye?\" He replied: \"That you associate a partner with Allah, who created you.\" He said: \"What next?\" He replied: \"That you kill your child out of fear that he would join you in food.\" He said: \"What next?\" He replied: \"That you commit adultery with your neighbor's wife.\" And the Almighty and Exalted Lord testified it: \"All those who call not unto another god along with Allah, and slay not any soul which Allah has forbidden, except in the cause of justice, nor commit fornication, and he who does this shall meet a requital of sin.\" [Qur'an 25:68]\n\nWe were along with Allah's Messenger at Mina, that moon was split up into two. One of its parts was behind the mountain and the other one was on this side of the mountain. Allah's Messenger said to us: \"Bear witness to this.\"\n\nUmar allotted Abdullah a pension of 6,000 \"dirhams\", and he was said to be very generous with his money. His mother was also granted a pension of 1,000 \"dirhams\".\n\nAround 642 Umar appointed him as a preacher, treasurer and magistrate (qāḍī) in Kufa, saying: \"I have preferred you with him over myself, so take him.\"\n\nAbdullah, in his capacity as treasurer, lent a sum of money to Saad ibn Abi Waqqas, the Governor of Kufa, and when he was unable to repay it, they quarreled. Their quarrel spread to their individual supporters until they became two \"wrangling factions\" in the city. Uthman became angry with both of them; in 646 he recalled Saad, extracted the money from him, and replaced him with al-Walid ibn Uqba. He thought of replacing Abdullah too, but in the end he decided against it.\n\nBy 650, Abdullah had quarreled with al-Walid. A petition was brought to Abdullah to investigate rumors that Al-Walid was drinking alcohol; Abdullah responded that it was not his business to spy on another man's privacy. Al-Walid felt that this statement was tantamount to a suspicion of his guilt. He accused Abdullah of not defending his reputation, and they insulted one another verbally. Al-Walid also tried to misappropriate state finances, but Abdullah refused to comply with his demands. When Uthman instructed Abdullah to obey al-Walid in everything, Abdullah resigned his post. However, he remained in Kufa and continued to criticise the Governor.\n\nAnother long-serving Muslim, Abu Dharr, was also living in Kufa. He lived in the desert of Al-Rabadha. Sometime later, Abdullah ibn Masud went on a pilgrimage to Mecca. As he passed through Al-Rabadha, his camels almost trod upon a funeral bier. A slave told him that it was the funeral of his master Abu Dharr, who had died alone. Abdullah burst into tears, exclaiming: \"The apostle was right! You walked alone, you died alone and you will be raised alone!\" Then he alighted from his camels and helped to bury his old friend.\n\nUthman produced a standardized version of the Qur'an in 652. He sent a copy to each province, and ordered that all other Quranic materials \"whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies,\" must be burned.\n\nIt is said that Abdullah was displeased by the finished product; in particular:\n\nWhen Uthman's agents came to Kufa to burn all the variants, Abdullah hid his copy from them. He justified his own version of the recitation by reminding people: \"I recited before Allah's Messenger more than seventy \"suras\" of the Qur'an. His Companions know that I have a better understanding of Allah's Book than they do; and if I were to know that someone had a better understanding than I have, I would have gone to him.\" It was said that nobody could find fault with Abdullah's version.\n\nWhen Uthman was called to account for his mismanagement as Caliph, one of the grievances against him was that he had destroyed variant readings of the Qur'an. Much later, Abdullah ibn Masud's variant readings were discussed on equal terms with the Uthmanic text by al-Farra (d. 207/822).\n\nHowever, the vast majority of Muslim scholars never accepted these reports due to their weakness, as well as many strong reports indicating the exact opposite to be true.\n\nThe Qur'an says in 15:87 \"We have given thee seven of the oft-repeated (verses) and the great Qur'an.\" The seven often-repeated verses refer to \"al-Fatihah\", the first \"sura\" of the Qur'an, which Abdullah ibn Masud is alleged to have denied. However, quoting Ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Ibn adh-Dhurays, Ibn al-Munzar and Ibn Mardwiyah, as-Suyuti narrated the following:\nIt is narrated from Abdullah Ibn Masud, regarding the word of Allah, \"We have given you the seven oft-repeated verses;\" he said, \"[It is] \"Fatihatu al-Kitab\".\"\n\nIn another narration, Abdullah ibn Masud was asked why he did not write \"al-Fatihah\" in his \"mushaf\". He replied, \"If I were to write it, I would write it before every \"sura\".\" Abu Bakr al-Anbari explains this saying every \"raka’a\" (in prayers) starts with \"al-Fatiha\" and then another \"sura\" is recited. It is as if Ibn Masud said, \"I have dropped it for the sake of brevity and I have trusted its preservation by Muslims (collectively).\"\n\nThere are also narrations from Abdullah where he explicitly refers to \"suras\" 113 and 114 as surahs, for example: \"Excessively recite two surahs. Allah will make you reach higher ranks in the Hereafter because of them. They are al-Mu'awwidhatayn (i.e. al-Falaq and an-Nas/nos. 113 & 114)…\"\n\nFour \"qira'at\" of the Qur'an (Qira'at of Hamzah, 'Aasim, Khalaf, Al-Kisa'i) have chains of transmission (\"isnad\") going through Abdullah ibn Masud, and they all include the above three \"suras\". These are \"mutawatir\" chains and thus Islamic scholars give precedence to them, disregarding much weaker chains that go against it as inauthentic.\n\nFor these reasons, Islamic scholars rejected the notion of Abdullah ibn Masud rejecting \"suras\". An-Nawawi says: \"The Muslims have all agreed that al-Mu'awwidhatayn and al-Fatihah are part of the Qur'an and whoever denies this becomes a disbeliever and whatever is quoted from Ibn Masud in this regard is not true.\" Ibn Hazm also rejected the notion of Ibn Masud denying these \"suras\", along with the vast majority of Islamic scholars.\n\nEventually, Uthman recalled Abdullah to Medina. He walked into the mosque, where Uthman was speaking, but the Caliph broke off his speech to insult Abdullah. Aisha then interrupted with protests against this manner of speech \"to a companion of Allah's Messenger\". Uthman forbade Abdullah ever to leave Medina again and ordered him out of the mosque. His servants removed Abdullah so violently that they broke two of his ribs and, amid loud protests from Aisha, he had to be carried home.\n\nUthman did not pay Abdullah's pension for the rest of his life.\n\nAbdullah ibn Masud died in Medina in 653 and was buried by the night at Al-Baqi'. It is disputed whether it was Ammar ibn Yasir or Caliph Uthman who led his funeral prayers. He left a fortune of 90,000 \"dirhams\". Al-Zubayr ibn al-Awam petitioned the Caliph to give Abdullah's pension to his heirs \"because they need it more than the treasury does.\" Uthman granted this request, although the exact value of the pension is disputed.\n"}

Unitrends also produces virtual appliances for VMware and Hyper-V marketed as Unitrends Backup. The physical appliances typically consist of some level of redundant components; most notably RAID in the form of RAID 1, RAID 6, and RAID 10. The larger appliances also have tiered flash storage in the form of SSD drives. These appliances perform either on-premises backup, off-premises disaster recovery, or through a technology known as cross-vaulting (a form of replication) an appliance may concurrently perform on-premises backup and off-premises disaster recovery. Unitrends also offers a multi-tenant public cloud based service, Unitrends Cloud. The company states that Unitrends Cloud is based on its previous product offering using its backup appliances to perform off-premises disaster recovery in a single-tenant private cloud deployment methodology.\n\nUnitrends uses file-and-image-based backup techniques coupled with storage-based and in-flight encryption, compression, data deduplication, and ransomware detection. The technology supports Bare-Metal restore as well as file-based recovery. Unitrends supports a form of disk staging in what it terms as D2D2x (Disk-to-Disk-to-Any) where “x” can be a disk, a tape, a private single-tenant cloud, or a public multi-tenant cloud. The company attempts to sell its support of storage, operating system, and application heterogeneity and claims that it supports over 250 versions of operating systems and applications.\n\nSince its inception in 1989, Unitrends Software Corporation has been at the forefront of backup and crash-recovery technology. The first with a software solution for system crashes, the company today provides a set of tools to help manage and protect data while providing data availability. Unitrends originated from a sole proprietorship called Medflex, which was founded in 1985 by Steve W. Schwartz to help fund medical missions. The first product, CTAR (Compressing Tape Archiver), was originally developed to handle the backup problems Schwartz encountered in his own medical office. After perfecting the program, it was sold commercially.\n\nIn 1988, Unitrends developed the first complete crash-recovery product for Santa Cruz Operation’s Xenix systems originally called Jet RestoreEase. Unitrends started as a stand-alone Unix backup software company and provided BareMetal recovery for platforms like the SCO offerings. BareMetal was later ported to SCO Unix and renamed System Crash Air-Bag. From 1988 to 1991, ten other software products were written for the Xenix and Unix environments and in 1999, Unitrends released their Backup Professional client/server backup software. In September 2002, Unitrends shipped backup appliances to Toshiba Machine Co. of America.\n\nUnitrends, has held a variety of locations during its existence. Initially based out of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, headquarters were relocated further inland to Columbia in November 2003 while support and development remained on the coast until 2005. In 2014, headquarters were moved again to Burlington, Massachusetts. where they remain today.\n\nOn October 31, 2013, Unitrends was acquired by Insight Venture Partners, a large global private equity and venture capital firm. Shortly after this acquisition, Unitrends obtained PHD Virtual on December 16, 2013. Unitrends acquired another company on May 29, 2014, taking over Australian-based Yuruware.

Quickly descending into madness, Mafune is able to gain control of Titanosaurus and joins forces with the Black Hole Aliens; the monster is used as the guardian of the destroyed Mechagodzilla's remains; an attack by Titanosaurus on a submarine sent to investigate the remains opens up the film. Dr. Mafune aids in the rebuilding and reconstruction of Mechagodzilla 2, and with both monsters under control, begins his revenge on humanity. After a lengthy battle across the Kantō region, Mechagodzilla 2 is destroyed by Godzilla, who then hits Titanosaurus with a blast of his atomic ray. Having already been left disoriented by the efforts of the humans, a dazed Titanosaurus then falls off a cliff into the ocean. Whether or not he survived is unknown.\n\nTitanosaurus has not appeared in any films since, although he briefly appeared as stock footage in the opening credits of the 2004 Millennium film \"\" as one of many monsters that arose from the devastation brought by the World Wars, along with Varan, Gezora, Baragon, Gaira, and Megaguirus.\n\nTitanosaurus is 60 meters (196 feet) tall and weighs 30,000 metric tons (33,069 short tons).\n\nTitanosaurus shares its name with a real dinosaur taxa, though they do not share much beyond nomenclature; Titanosaurus' design is more reminiscent of spinosaurs, such as \"Spinosaurus\" or \"Suchomimus\", as it shares the same aquatic adaptations, crocodile-like snout and sports a sail-like fin emerging from the dorsal side of his back, like the humps or spines of a spinosaur except for a fish-like tail. Originally, Titanosaurus was going to be two separate monsters called the Titans that would eventually merge into the final design, but due to budgetary restraints only the final form of the Titanosaurus suit was made. The roars of Titanosaurus are a combination of modified elephant trumpets and horse snorts.\n\nAs well as using teeth and claws to fight, Titanosaurus can, by employing his tail as a fan, generate winds strong enough to demolish buildings and hurl debris at great velocities. When used in the water, it creates whirlpools powerful enough to completely immobilize submarines, in addition to its use as a high-powered propeller and rudder. Titanosaurus is quite hardy as well as a determined combatant, standing toe-to-toe and exchanging blows with Godzilla on a number of occasions, and in addition landing kicks and punches that propel his opponent great distances (He is even able to lift Godzilla off the ground with just his jaws), but even though Godzilla's atomic ray and extensive combat experience ultimately give him an edge when facing Titanosaurus one-on-one, as Titanosaurus seems to lack a ranged weapon in the film, Mechagodzilla 2's timely interventions allow his ally to retain or regain the initiative as necessary. Leading up to their first fight, the alien leader predicts Godzilla would be badly hurt with Titanosaurus dead which would end perfectly for them to finish off Godzilla and Tokyo with Mechagodzilla. Mafune however said to his daughter Mechagodzilla is no match for Titanosaurus as he just a machine, not alive, ultimately he would regret his genius as the aliens take his approach by putting Mechagodzilla's controls in Katsura's stomach.\n\nIn \"\", Titanosaurus has a sonic beam as his ranged weapon; though ironic, the explanation given is that Titanosaurus' own sonar waves (generated whilst he was deep underwater) were disrupted by the humans' sonic device; as many undersea creatures evolve some kind of sonar or enormous eyes to see in the lowest parts of the ocean.\n\n\n\n"}

It is notable for the deformable terrain effects, and for being BioWare's first developed game.\n\n\"Shattered Steel\" takes place in a desolate future where humanity is on the verge of extinction. The single-player campaign takes place over 5 separate worlds (planets), each planet has about 20 missions.\n\nThe enemy in the game is a group of aliens who are in some way or another organic, mechanical or a combination of both. Examples of this are the Aspis, a spider-like enemy with an organic look and the Wasp, a very mechanical looking air vehicle. As the story unfolds, more is discovered about who controls the aliens, what their purposes are, and how to destroy them once and for all.\n\nThe gameplay is similar in style to the \"MechWarrior\" video game series, featuring mechanized combat in bipedal machines called \"Planet Runners\". Runners do not generally take humanoid shapes - only two of them, the Retro and Shiva, have a distinct human shape and neither of them have arms. Some of the Runners are based around animals, such as the Raptor, with a very overbearing appearance and \"Chicken walker\" style legs, with claw-like feet. The enemies are somewhat more varied but generally center around animals such as spiders, scorpions and the praying mantis.\n\nAll of the Runners have a specific weight limitation, and can have their weapons, shield generator and engines interchanged and removed based around this limit. Each of the runners has a primary weapon mount, and one or more secondary weapon mounts, along with a shield and generator bay. Primary weapons are mounted on the head of the Runner and most feature twin primary mounts for a pair of guns. Secondary mounts are singular and weapons can be grouped, single, or alternately fired independent of the primary guns.\n\nThere are specific sets of primary and secondary weapons, and they are not interchangeable. A set of three laser and three bullet weapons, with two special energy weapons round out the primary weapons. Secondary weapons range from dumb fire rockets, guided missiles and energy cannons to howitzers, mortar cannons and - very late in the game - nuclear missiles.\n\nEnergy weapons have a maximum ammo amount (up to 200 in some cases) and recharge when below this number. Bullet weapons however, do not recharge, nor are mid-mission reloads possible. Weapons can sometimes be picked up off the battlefield, at the expense of dropping the currently selected secondary (or current primary) weapon. One advantage of this is the ability to pick up a weapon too heavy for the Runner to normally use, at the cost of drastically reduced speed.\n\nMissions vary from assaults, infiltrations, recon to defending bases or convoy escorts. Combat is fairly straightforward, with the ability to tilt and pivot the Runners \"head\" (and sometimes the entire torso) to target enemies not directly ahead of the player. This is especially useful when attempting to take down rather frequent encounters with airborne units.\n\nThe two main features are locational damage and deformable terrain. Locational damage applies to all enemy units and buildings, allowing the player to target legs to quickly destroy or disable enemies, to destroying the head, which in most cases is not actually fatal, but has practical or comedic purposes. The basic bipedal walker enemy without its head has no weapons, but it will continue to walk around - blind - bumping into the player or buildings. Deformable terrain is primarily a visual pleasure, with little practical use. However, persistence or clever thinking can reward the player with a tactical advantage. shooting at the edge of a hillside can create a \"notch\" to fire down onto or up at targets. The biggest deformation possible is the nuclear missile. Accompanied by a white flash, it will not only obliterate almost anything within its wide explosion radius, it also creates a large crater and sends out a shock wave along the ground, using the terrain as a moving \"wall\". Not only does this serve to trap anyone surviving the blast inside a deep, burning crater, but it can be used as a mountain-destroying device, or to rip a chunk out of just about anything that stands in the player's way. Any terrain deformation can be seen on the game's 3D, real-time map screen.\n\nIn total there are 7 Planet Runners available to the player: Gnat, Stormguard, Invader, Warthog, Raptor, Retro, and Shiva. Each class of Runner also has its own onboard computer, with its own voice overs and in some cases, a different view on things. The heavy runners speak in first person (\"I have damage to my hull\"), where the lighter runners are more formal (\"Warning: Damage to hull\").\n\nThe player is assisted by yet another voiced computer situated in its starship in orbit around the planet. The AINIC\"(Artificial Intelligence Network Interface Coupler)\" Mark 3, as it calls itself, provides all mission summaries, briefings and mid-mission updates with a full voiced backing, and is presented as a self-aware computer entity.\n\nThe game also includes multiplayer and a mission editor. Multiplayer can support up to 16 players, and a \"single player anarchy\" mode also includes options for co-op play, custom missions, bots, and playing single player missions with multiple humans, either with the aliens or against them.\n\nBefore the game release, a playable \"Interactive Preview\" was sold in stores. This preview came with a cloudy-red \"Interactive Preview\" CD-Rom (DOS version) in a standard jewel case, a red manual with, on its front, a small Interplay advertisement \"6$ OFF mail-in rebate...\" and a promotional \"coming this fall\" Shattered Steel advertising the full version at $15.95, and a \"Get Shattered\" back cover with the game plot and screenshots. This demo was not rated at its release (Rating Pending \"RP\"). Some Interactive Preview discs were defective, rendering working copies very scarce for collectors and fans.\n\nShattered Steel has an aggregate review score of 72.67% on Gamerankings.com. <br>\nReviewing the MS-DOS version, Tim Soete of GameSpot said that while the plot is interesting, \"Shattered Steel\" is more of a mindless action game than \"\" and does not have the same sense of immersion, though it is still enjoyable. \"Next Generation\" similarly described it as \"along the lines of \"Earthsiege II\" or \"MechWarrior 2\", but without the complexity. It settles for pure action from the minute players climb into their giant robots ...\" He too found it enjoyable in spite of its lack of depth or innovation, noting the numerous missions, selection of weapons, and options for networked multiplayer. \"Macworld\"s Michael Gowan wrote that \"Shattered Steel\"s \"visuals are solid (although a few years old at this point), and the play is engaging.\" While he recommended it to fans of science-fiction simulation games, he argued that the \"scope of the game's missions could be more varied\".\n\n"}

It serves the cities of Rotterdam and The Hague and their regions. The airport handled over 2.1 million passengers in 2019 and features scheduled flights to European metropolitan and leisure destinations. It is also used extensively by general aviation and there are several flying clubs, a skydiving club and a flight training school located at the airport.\n\nAfter World War II, the Dutch government decided that a second national airport was needed in addition to Schiphol. Rotterdam had had an airport before the war - Waalhaven airport - but it was heavily damaged in the German bombing of Rotterdam, and was later completely destroyed to prevent it from being used by the Germans. Reconstruction of the airport was not a realistic proposition, so a new location was found in the \"Zestienhoven\" polder, giving the airport its name.\n\nConstruction of the airport began in August 1955 and the airport was officially opened in October 1956. Several large international airlines, such as Swissair, Lufthansa, Air France, Channel Airways, and British Air Ferries (Channel Air Bridge) were soon operating to Rotterdam. However, in the 1970s plans were made to either close or move the airport to make space for housing. Its uncertain future halted the airport's growth and led to many operators leaving.\n\nFor almost thirty years the airport faced closure, but the economic growth of the 1990s caused an increase in passengers again and in 2001 it was decided that the airport's current location would be maintained for at least a century.\n\nThe route with the longest continual service, to London Heathrow and operated by KLM Cityhopper, was suspended in 2008. This marked the end of KLM's involvement with the airport. However, in December 2012, British Airways began a service to Rotterdam from Heathrow. In October 2014 British Airways announced they would suspend the route again in March 2015. British Airways now flies to Rotterdam from London City Airport.\n\nThe name of the airport was changed from \"Zestienhoven\" to \"Rotterdam Airport\" and finally in 2010 to its current name \"Rotterdam The Hague Airport\".\n\nMost flights today are operated by smaller mainline jets such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 series or the Embraer 190. There is also a fair amount of business aviation. State and military aircraft also use the airport frequently, this due to The Hague being the seat of the Dutch government and also housing various other international institutions such as the International Criminal Court. With the closure of nearby Ypenburg Airport in 1992 and Valkenburg Naval Air Base in 2006, Rotterdam The Hague airport is now the only remaining airport in the area for those types of flights.\n\nThe airport experienced significant growth in the 2010s, doubling passenger numbers from 1,000,858 in 2010 to 2,133,976 in 2019.\n\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Rotterdam:\n\nThe airport is served by bus line 33, which runs between Rotterdam Centraal, the airport, and further to Meijersplein station. At Meijersplein, transfers are available to metro line E, with frequent service to Den Haag Centraal, Rotterdam Centraal and Rotterdam city center.\n\nThe airport is situated next to the busy A13/E19 motorway, which makes it easily accessible via car.\n\n\n"}

It corresponds to the selenic acid, HSeO, which is a strong acid and can in its concentrated form dissolve gold.\n\nThe element selenium exhibits several valence states. Selenate is the least reduced, followed by selenite, and elemental selenium. The valence state is an important factor to the toxicity of selenium. Selenate is the form required by organisms that need selenium as a micronutrient. These organisms have the ability to acquire, metabolize and excrete selenium. The level at which selenium becomes toxic varies from species to species and is related to other environmental factors like pH and alkalinity that influence the concentration of selenite over selenate.\n\nSelenate and other forms of selenium are highest in areas where ancient seas have evaporated. These areas are enriched in selenium and over millennia, biologic adaptation has occurred. \n"}

It is an Art Deco structure at the southeast corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Hamilton Drive designed by architect S. Charles Lee and is considered a classic Los Angeles landmark. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on .\n\nLocated on Wilshire Boulevard, the exterior of the building with its simple Art Deco ornamentation is one of the first buildings seen by pedestrians and drivers entering the eastern boundary of the city of Beverly Hills.\n\nThe Saban Theatre has been both a significant cultural and architectural landmark for Los Angeles and Beverly Hills since its opening as the Fox Wilshire Theatre on September 19, 1930. It was originally designed with 2500 seats by noted theatre architect S. Charles Lee to be a major film presentation house, even including a stage for Vaudeville acts before the films.\n\nOver its 85-year history, the Saban has been the site of numerous film premieres, exclusive first-run film engagements, live concerts and touring Broadway shows. Despite several renovations, the interior remains mostly intact with its columned two-story rotunda lobby, spacious orchestra and balcony level seating for 2,000, and its silver, gold and black proscenium and organ screens. The connection with architect S. Charles Lee, a long-time resident of the city of Beverly Hills, makes the Saban significant also as an example of Lee's transition from the French Regency style of the Tower Theatre and other Los Angeles Theatres to the nascent Art Deco style that would come to dominate movie palace architecture in the 1930s.\n\nThe Saban Theatre opened as the Fox Wilshire Theatre and for several decades was one of 20th Century Fox's premiere theaters, serving as a movie palace until a 1981 renovation converted it into a stage venue. It was operated by the Nederlander Organization from 1981 to 1989. It is now regularly used as a live performance venue for comedy, music, television, film shoots, screenings, and community intercultural events such as PaleyFest. Temple of the Arts has owned and operated the theatre since 2005. Sterling Venue Ventures, led by Lance Sterling currently produces over 50 concerts and events at the Saban per year. Notable performers Sterling has brought to the theatre include Marillion, Paul Anka, Burt Bacharach, Frankie Valli, Styx, George Thorogood, Kenny Loggins, Todd Rundgren, and Morris Day.\n\nIn March 2009, owners announced that the Wilshire would be renamed the Saban Theatre in recognition of a $5 million grant from Haim and Cheryl Saban. The funds have been used to further restoration efforts on the orchestra, proscenium and marquee. It also houses programs by Temple of the Arts, which aims to integrate the arts and Judaism.\n\nBeverly Hills Performing Arts Center led the movement to have the city of Beverly Hills create a Historic Preservation Ordinance passing the Mills Act, which supports historic theatres. BHPAC secured placement of the venue on The Federal and State Registry of Historic Places and designation of the theatre as a Beverly Hills landmark.\n\nBHPAC'S mission was summarized as \"Awakening a Sleeping Beauty,\" engaging design firm Evergreene Architectural Arts, which specializes in historic theatre restoration. Past evergreen projects include Radio City Music Hall, The Metropolitan Opera, Broadway's New Amsterdam Theatre, Hollywood's Pantages and Santa Barbara's Granada Theatre. They guided the restoration of the theatre orchestra and proscenium with the help of the archives of renowned theatre architect S. Charles Lee at the UCLA School of Architecture.\n\nIn conjunction with Sterling Venue Ventures LLC, management began an extensive update of the stage, lighting, and sound systems so that performances of Broadway shows and live concerts could be enhanced. State of the art robotic cameras were also installed to capture live performance in high quality. Sterling Venue Ventures, in addition to updating the space, has also added special private event functionality to the venue to accommodate all types of special events up to 1,800 people.\n\nTo reawaken the storied film history of the theatre, philanthropist film producer Steve Tisch gifted the naming rights for the Steve Tisch Cinema Center. This endowment enabled the installation of a state of the art film projection system as the theatre continues to host opening nights for major film festivals and special screenings.\n\nNotable premieres and events at the Saban have included:\n\nSince Sterling Venue Ventures has begun managing the Saban Theatre, notable events have included:\n\nIn May 1944, thirteen-year-old Patsy Ruth Brown disappeared after leaving producer Jack Schwarz's Fox Wilshire Building penthouse. Schwarz told juvenile officers that Patsy had spent the afternoon in his apartment. That evening he gave her three dollars for a taxi. According to Schwarz, Patsy left in the company of an older girl named O'Hara, whom Patsy had brought with her. Schwarz said that Patsy had begged him numerous times for a role in one of his films. Her only film appearance (uncredited) was in \"Nearly Eighteen\" (1943). A taxi driver who took Patsy to Union Station told the police that Patsy said she was going to San Bernardino to visit her father, an employee of a Barstow, California rock company.

Marcello (born December 13, 1943), also known variously as \"Little Jimmy\", \"Jimmy Light\" and as \"Jimmy the Man\", is a crime boss who was a front boss for the Chicago Outfit criminal organization in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. Organized crime observers identified Marcello as a figurehead during that period while the organization's day-to-day operations actually were run by John \"No Nose\" DiFronzo, Joseph \"Joey the Clown\" Lombardo, Joseph \"Joe the Builder\" Andriacchi and Angelo J. LaPietra.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Marcello worked as a laborer for Chicago's Department of Streets and Sanitation from 1960 until 1973.\n\nMarcello reportedly became a \"made\" member in the Chicago mob in 1983—a step that, a mob turncoat testified in 2007, required an individual to be 100 percent Italian and also to have participated in at least one killing. Actually (and perhaps unknown to Marcello's bosses), Marcello's mother was Irish.\n\nAlthough he had no criminal record, Marcello first became identified by authorities as a critical member of the Chicago Outfit in the 1980s because of his role as a driver for Chicago mob bosses Joseph Aiuppa and Sam \"Wings\" Carlisi and as a confidant to Carlisi.\n\nOn December 15, 1992, federal authorities charged Marcello and reputed mob boss Sam \"Wings\" Carlisi with racketeering. Marcello was accused of being the underboss for Carlisi, whose street crew worked its rackets in Chicago's western suburbs. On December 16, 1993, Marcello, Carlisi and five other crew members were convicted on racketeering charges, with Marcello in particular being found to have run bookmaking, street-tax and juice-loan operations in western Cook County and in DuPage County. Marcello and Carlisi also were convicted of plotting the never-carried-out murder of gangland associate Anthony Daddino because of fears that Daddino would cooperate with law enforcement after a 1989 extortion conviction, and Marcello also was convicted of financing long-time mobster Lenny Patrick's juice-loan operation. In addition, Marcello was found to have ordered Patrick to firebomb the Lake Theater in Oak Park, Illinois during a union dispute.\n\nOn April 5, 1995, Marcello was sentenced to 12½ years in prison. During his sentencing, he told U.S. District Judge Paul Plunkett, \"If my name wasn't James Marcello, I wouldn't be standing in front of you. That's all I have to say,\" according to an April 6, 1995, \"Chicago Tribune\" article. In November 2003, Marcello was released from a federal prison camp in Milan, Michigan and returned to his home in Lombard, Illinois. During the Family Secrets trial, it came out that Marcello began working at some point after his 2003 release from prison for DVD Management, an Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois-based operator of nursing homes.\n\nIn April 2005, Marcello and his younger half-brother, Michael \"Mickey\" Marcello, were indicted on murder and racketeering charges. Marcello was accused of murdering Nicholas D'Andrea, in 1981, attempting to kill Nicholas Sarillo Sr. in 1982, and murdering brothers Anthony \"Tony the Ant\" Spilotro and Michael Spilotro in 1986. Until his indictment, James Marcello also was identified as running the Cicero, Illinois, crew faction of the Outfit with his brother Michael. The indictment alleged that both Marcellos had operated a lucrative video-gambling business, named M&M Amusement, that had placed video-gambling machines in businesses in Berwyn, Illinois and Cicero, Illinois from January 1996 until April 2004.\n\nShortly after he was indicted, Marcello attempted to be released on bond, offering to put up homes worth $12.5 million as bond and also offering to permit law enforcement officials to intercept his telephone calls. The homes included a $9 million house in Oak Brook, Illinois that was owned by Marcello's niece, Theresa Borsellino, and her husband; $1.1 million of equity in a house in Oak Brook that was owned by Nicholas Vangel—described as Marcello's employer—and his wife, Dorothy; a house in Palos Hills, Illinois owned by Marcello's son, James Marcello, Jr.; a summer house in Michigan City, Indiana owned by James Marcello, Jr.; a farm in McHenry County, Illinois owned by James Marcello, Jr.; and two homes in Long Beach, Indiana owned by James Marcello, Jr.'s boss. On April 29, 2005, however, U.S. District Judge James Zagel denied Marcello's request to be released on bond.\n\nOn June 21, 2007, the \"Operation Family Secrets\" trial began in Chicago. The case was prosecuted by federal mob prosecutors Mitch Mars, T. Markus Funk, and John Scully. Although several other high-profile defendants, including Frank Calabrese, Sr., and Joseph Lombardo, took the highly unusual step of testifying in their own defense, Marcello opted not to take the stand to testify. On September 10, 2007, Marcello was convicted of racketeering conspiracy that involved decades of extortion, loan sharking and murder.\n\nOn February 5, 2009, Marcello was sentenced to life in prison for the Spilotro murders, and United States District Judge James Zagel, agreeing with the presentation made by federal prosecutor Markus Funk, also found Marcello responsible for the D'Andrea murder as well, even though the jury had deadlocked on that count. \"Mr. Marcello, you did have the appropriate demeanor in court,\" United States District Judge James Zagel told Marcello. \"I believe you possess abilities that your co-defendants (Frank Calabrese, Sr. and Joseph Lombardo) did not have. I believe you have self-control and judgment that your co-defendants did not have...You know how to do the right thing...What is most significant is that you could have done better, because perhaps unlike your co-defendants, you know how to do better. I regret that you did not lead a better life. You are going to pay for your crimes.\"\n\nRight after his sentencing in 2009, Marcello was sent to be incarcerated at the high-security United States Penitentiary, Atwater, near Atwater, California. However, the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago ordered him returned to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago to be present for a hearing on a related legal matter, and Zagel then approved Marcello's extended stay for his appeal. With Marcello's appeals virtually exhausted, the federal government—without Zagel's permission—began transferring Marcello to Atwater in early February 2012. However, on February 9, 2012, Zagel angrily demanded that Marcello be brought back to Chicago to help his attorney with his pending appeal. Arguments in Marcello's appeal were scheduled for February 13, 2012, and Zagel acknowledged the tight turnaround as he publicly excoriated the federal government for transferring Marcello out of Chicago without Zagel's permission. \"I don't even know how they're going to get him back,\" Zagel said, referring to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. \"But they are going to get him back here because that's my order...He will remain here until I order him released.\"\n\nMarcello currently is imprisoned at the ADX Florence supermax prison in Colorado.\n\nMarcello is the son of Samuel Marcello, a Chicago mobster who disappeared in November 1973 after collecting a juice loan from a Chicago restaurant owner. Samuel Marcello's body was not found until July 6, 1974, when it was uncovered in a 50-gallon steel drum left at the sandwich shop. The sandwich shop owner, Sam Rantis, had been found dead earlier in 1974, his body stuffed into his car trunk at O'Hare International Airport. Law enforcement believed at the time that Rantis was blamed by the mob for the deaths of Samuel Marcello, and fellow mobster Joseph Grisafe, and he was slain in retaliation.\n\nMarcello's mother, Irene Flynn (later Irene Marcello, and later Irene Marcello Evans), was 100 percent Irish. She died in mid-February 2009, less than two weeks after her son James Marcello was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nMarcello has been married to Sandra Marcello since the early 1960s and has three children with her, Samuel, James Marcello, Jr., Rocco, and had two daughters Debbie and Mary from a minor affair \"which Marcello never known\" and eight grandchildren. Including his grandson Jimmy Marcello Jr.\n\nMarcello also had a mistress for more than two decades who took his last name and testified for the prosecution in the Family Secrets trial. Connie Marcello told jurors in 2007 that James Marcello had given her thousands of dollars a month in cash.\n\nIn addition, Marcello's sister, Ann, is married to William Galioto, a former police officer who has been listed as a lieutenant on the Chicago Crime Commission's organizational chart of Chicago organized crime. In 1995, William Galioto, Ann Galioto, and William Galioto's son, Sam Galioto, were denied a $5.5 million loan from City of Chicago officials to build a video and movie production center because of city officials' fears that the family might have organized crime ties.\n\nThe Spilotro murders were fictionalized in the 1995 film \"Casino\". However, while the Spilotros were buried in Enos, Indiana, they weren't murdered in the place they were buried, as portrayed in the film. In the film, the \"bosses\" have had enough of \"Nicky\" (Tony) and \"Dominick\" (Michael); and their own crew, including \"Frank Marino\" (Frank Cullotta), betrays them and beats them with baseball bats, strips their clothes off and buries them while they are still breathing.\n\n\n"}

Instead, selenic acid may also be prepared by the oxidation of selenous acid () with halogens, such as chlorine or bromine, or with potassium permanganate. However, using chlorine or bromine as the oxidising agent also produces hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid as a side-product, which needs to be removed from the solution since they can reduce the selenic acid to selenous acid.\n\nAnother method of preparing selenic acid is by the oxidation of elemental selenium in a water suspension by chlorine:\n\nTo obtain the anhydrous acid as a crystalline solid, the resulting solution is evaporated at temperatures below in a vacuum.\n\nLike sulfuric acid, selenic acid is a strong acid that is hygroscopic and extremely soluble in water. Concentrated solutions are viscous. Crystalline mono- and di-hydrates are known.

It is one of the most important places of worship for Hindus in Kerala and is often referred to as \"Bhuloka Vaikunta\" (Holy Abode of Vishnu on Earth).\n\nThe presiding deity of the Guruvayur Temple is Vishnu, worshipped in the form of his avatar Krishna. The central icon is a four-armed standing Vishnu carrying the conch Panchajanya, the discus Sudarshana Chakra, the mace Kaumodaki, and a lotus with a Holy basil garland. This image represents the majestic form of Vishnu as revealed to Krishna's parents Vasudeva and Devaki around the time of Krishna's birth. Worship proceeds according to routines laid down by Adi Shankara and later written formally in the Tantric way, the inter-religious spiritual movement that arose in medieval India, by Chennas Narayanan Nambudiri (born in 1427). The Chennas Nambudiris are the hereditary tantris (high priest) of the Guruvayur Temple.\n\nThe temple is managed by a special Devaswom (Guruvayur Devaswom) under the control of the Government of Kerala. The main festivals of this temple are the 10-day festival in the Malayalam month of Kumbham starting with flag hoisting on Pooyam star, Sri Krishna Janmashtami (Birthday of Lord Krishna) in the month of Chingam, Ekadasi (11th day) in the shukla paksha (bright fortnight) in the month of Vrischikam, popularly called as \"Guruvayur Ekadasi\" and Vishu on the first day of the month of Medam, once a harvest festival. The temple's sub-deities are Ganapathi, Ayyappan and Bhagavathi, and there are two sub-temples each, one for Ganapathi and the other for \"Nagadevata\" nearby the temple.\n\nAccording to legend, Janamejaya conducted a sacrifice to destroy all the snakes of the world including Takshaka, who was the cause of his father Parikshit's death. Hundreds of thousands of snakes fell into the sacrificial fire and were killed, but the sacrifice was stopped by a Brahmin called Astika, before Takshaka was killed.\n\nSince Janamejaya was responsible for the death of millions of snakes, he was afflicted with leprosy. He lost all hope of a cure. One day Sage Atreya (son of Atri) came before Janamejaya and told him to take refuge under the feet of Krishna at Guruvayoor. Atreya told him that in the temple at Guruvayur the effulgence of Sri Hari is at its best and Vishnu showers his blessings on all devotees. He immediately rushed there and spent the next ten months worshipping the god of Guruvayur. At the end of ten months, he returned home healthy and took the astrologer to task for making a false prediction. The astrologer told him that he would find the mark of a snakebite on his left leg. He had escaped death only because he was at that time in a temple where Anantha (the emperor of serpents) was present and Anantha was the brother to the God at Guruvayur where he had finished worshipping.\n\nThe king then decided to build a full-fledged temple at Guruvayur. In time, this temple came to be downgraded and reduced to poverty during the days when Kerala was ruled by the Perumals. The Perumal rulers were mostly Shaivites and did not extend their patronage to Vaishnavite shrines. The Shiva temple at Mammiyur received their patronage and with the shift of royal patronage, the worshippers also moved to the Shiva temple. The Guruvayur temple was thus reduced to utmost poverty. However, one day, a holy man went to the Mammiyur temple for food and hospitality for the night. Though the temple was affluent, the temple authorities pretended they had nothing and scornfully directed him to the neighbouring Guruvayur temple. When the holy man entered the precincts of that temple, he was courteously received by a Brahmin boy and sumptuously fed. The holy man was very much pleased and he pronounced a blessing. According to the legend, Mammiyur Siva temple began to decline, and the fortunes of Guruvayur Vishnu temple progressed from strength to strength.\n\nIn the 14th century, the Tamil literature \"Kokasandesam\" refers to a place named \"Kuruvayur\" and in the 16th century (fifty years after \"Narayaniyam\" was composed) there are also multiple references to Kuruvayur. In ancient Dravidian languages, \"kuruvai\" means \"sea\", hence the village on the Malabar Coast may be called Kuruvayur.\n\nThe earliest temple records date back to the 17th century. The earliest mention of the many important Vishnu temples of Kerala are found in the songs of Alwars, Tamil saints, whose time-line is not exactly fixed. However, by the end of 16th century, Guruvayur had become the most popular pilgrimage centre in Kerala.\n\nIn 1716, the Dutch raided Guruvayur. They looted treasures and set fire to the Western Gopuram (later rebuilt in 1747). In 1755, the Dutch destroyed the Trikkunavay temple and the Brahmins fled from there. \n\nIn 1766, Hyder Ali of Mysore captured Kozhikkode (Calicut) and then Guruvayur. He demanded 10,000 fanams in ransom to spare the temple. The ransom was paid but due to insecurity pilgrims receded. On the request of the Malabar Governor, Shrnivasa Rao, Hyder Ali granted a Devadaya to save the temple. Later, in 1789 AD, Tippu Sultan invaded the province. Tippu destroyed the smaller shrines and set fire to the Temple, but it was saved due to timely rain. Tippu lost to the Travancore and the English in 1792. The idol, which had been hidden underground in anticipation of the Tippu's takeover, was re-installed on 17 September 1792.\nUllanad Panikkars rescued and looked after the temple from 1825 to 1900. From 1859 to 1892, the Chuttambalam, the Vilakkumatam, the Koottambalam and Sasta shrine were renovated and roofed with copper sheeting. In 1900, the administrator Konti Menon fixed the hours of worship and led the drive to keep the temple premises clean. He set up the big bell and reconstructed Pattayappura (granary). In 1928, Kozhikode once again became the administrator of Guruvayur.\n\nOn 30 November 1970, a massive fire broke out in the temple, gutting the whole chuttambalam and the entire Vilakkumatam on the west, south and north sides.\n\nThe temple tank (pond) on the northern side of the temple is called \"Rudratheertham\". According to legend, for thousands of years, Lord Shiva and his family worshipped Lord Vishnu on the southern bank of this pond. Since Shiva is also known by the name 'Rudra', the pond came to be known as Rudratheertham.\n\n\nStrict dress code exists for people who wish to enter the Guruvayur Temple. Men are to wear mundu around their waist, without any dress covering their chest. But it is allowed to cover the chest region with a small piece of cloth (veshthi). Boys are allowed to wear shorts, but they are also prohibited from wearing a shirt. Girls and women are not allowed to wear any trouser like dresses or short skirts. Women are allowed to wear sari and girls are to wear long skirt and blouses. Presently the dress code for women have been relaxed with shalwar kameez (chudidhar pyjamas) being allowed.\n\nThe Punnathur kotta, also known as the Anakotta (Elephant Yard in English), houses the 56 elephants belonging to the temple. This place is the home to the largest population of captive male Asian elephants in the world. These elephants are donated by devotees to the temple, and due to the preference of donating tusked male elephants, the ratio of male and female elephants living at the Anakotta is skewed. The elephants were initially kept at a compound close to the temple when the numbers were low. However, as more and more devotees donated elephants, the space became insufficient and hence they were moved to a larger property three kilometres away from the temple. Because of their association with the temple, devotees consider several of these elephants as living forms of Lord Guruvayurappa himself. Guruvayur Keshavan was the most famous among those.\n\nThe capture, treatment, and living conditions of the elephants in Guruvayur has been subject to criticism. In a study, the Animal Welfare Board of India found several violations. There have been incidents of elephants being tortured at the yard.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2256109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2256109", "title": "Situation calculus", "text": "Situation calculus\n\nThe situation calculus is a logic formalism designed for representing and reasoning about dynamical domains. It was first introduced by John McCarthy in 1975. The main version of the situational calculus that is presented in this article is based on that introduced by Ray Reiter in 1991. It is followed by sections about McCarthy's 1986 version and a logic programming formulation.\n\nThe situation calculus represents changing scenarios as a set of first-order logic formulae. The basic elements of the calculus are:\n\n\nA domain is formalized by a number of formulae, namely:\n\n\nA simple robot world will be modeled as a running example. In this world there is a single robot and several inanimate objects. The world is laid out according to a grid so that locations can be specified in terms of formula_1 coordinate points. It is possible for the robot to move around the world, and to pick up and drop items. Some items may be too heavy for the robot to pick up, or fragile so that they break when they are dropped. The robot also has the ability to repair any broken items that it is holding.\n\nThe main elements of the situation calculus are the actions, fluents and the situations. A number of objects are also typically involved in the description of the world. The situation calculus is based on a sorted domain with three sorts: actions, situations, and objects, where the objects include everything that is not an action or a situation. Variables of each sort can be used. While actions, situations, and objects are elements of the domain, the fluents are modeled as either predicates or functions.\n\nThe actions form a sort of the domain. Variables of sort action can be used. Actions can be quantified. In the example robot world, possible action terms would be formula_2 to model the robot moving to a new location formula_1, and formula_4 to model the robot picking up an object formula_5. A special predicate formula_6 is used to indicate when an action is executable.\n\nIn the situation calculus, a dynamic world is modeled as progressing through a series of situations as a result of various actions being performed within the world. A situation represents a history of action occurrences. In the Reiter version of the situation calculus described here, a situation does not represent a state, contrarily to the literal meaning of the term and contrarily to the original definition by McCarthy and Hayes. This point has been summarized by Reiter as follows:\n\nThe situation before any actions have been performed is typically denoted formula_7 and called the initial situation. The new situation resulting from the performance of an action is denoted using the function symbol formula_8 (Some other references also use formula_9). This function symbol has a situation and an action as arguments, and a situation as a result, the latter being the situation that results from performing the given action in the given situation.\n\nThe fact that situations are sequences of actions and not states is enforced by an axiom stating that formula_10 is equal to formula_11 if and only if formula_12 and formula_13. This condition makes no sense if situations were states, as two different actions executed in two different states can result in the same state.\n\nIn the example robot world, if the robot's first action is to move to location formula_14, the first action is formula_15 and the resulting situation is formula_16. If its next action is to pick up the ball, the resulting situation is formula_17. Situations terms like formula_16 and formula_17 denote the sequences of executed actions, and not the description of the state that result from execution.\n\nStatements whose truth value may change are modeled by \"relational fluents\", predicates which take a situation as their final argument. Also possible are \"functional fluents\", functions which take a situation as their final argument and return a situation-dependent value. Fluents may be thought of as \"properties of the world\"'.\nIn the example, the fluent formula_20 can be used to indicate that the robot is carrying a particular object in a particular situation. If the robot initially carries nothing, formula_21 is false while formula_22 is true. The location of the robot can be modeled using a functional fluent formula_23 which returns the location formula_1 of the robot in a particular situation.\n\nThe description of a dynamic world is encoded in second order logics using three kinds of formulae: formulae about actions (preconditions and effects), formulae about the state of the world, and foundational axioms.\n\nSome actions may not be executable in a given situation. For example, it is impossible to put down an object unless one is in fact carrying it. The restrictions on the performance of actions are modeled by literals of the form formula_25, where formula_26 is an action, formula_27 a situation, and formula_6 is a special binary predicate denoting executability of actions. In the example, the condition that dropping an object is only possible when one is carrying it is modeled by:\n\nformula_29\n\nAs a more complex example, the following models that the robot can carry only one object at a time, and that some objects are too heavy for the robot to lift (indicated by the predicate formula_30):\n\nformula_31\n\nGiven that an action is possible in a situation, one must specify the effects of that action on the fluents. This is done by the effect axioms. For example, the fact that picking up an object causes the robot to be carrying it can be modeled as:\n\nformula_32\n\nIt is also possible to specify conditional effects, which are effects that depend on the current state. The following models that some objects are fragile (indicated by the predicate formula_33) and dropping them causes them to be broken (indicated by the fluent formula_34):\n\nformula_35\n\nWhile this formula correctly describes the effect of the actions, it is not sufficient to correctly describe the action in logic, because of the frame problem.\n\nWhile the above formulae seem suitable for reasoning about the effects of actions, they have a critical weakness - they cannot be used to derive the \"non-effects\" of actions. For example, it is not possible to deduce that after picking up an object, the robot's location remains unchanged. This requires a so-called frame axiom, a formula like:\n\nformula_36\n\nThe need to specify frame axioms has long been recognised as a problem in axiomatizing dynamic worlds, and is known as the frame problem. As there are generally a very large number of such axioms, it is very easy for the designer to leave out a necessary frame axiom, or to forget to modify all appropriate axioms when a change to the world description is made.\n\nThe successor state axioms \"solve\" the frame problem in the situation calculus. According to this solution, the designer must enumerate as effect axioms all the ways in which the value of a particular fluent can be changed. The effect axioms affecting the value of fluent formula_37 can be written in generalised form as a positive and a negative effect axiom:\n\nformula_38\n\nformula_39\n\nThe formula formula_40 describes the conditions under which action formula_26 in situation formula_27 makes the fluent formula_43 become true in the successor situation formula_10. Likewise, formula_45 describes the conditions under which performing action formula_26 in situation formula_27 makes fluent formula_43 false in the successor situation.\n\nIf this pair of axioms describe all the ways in which fluent formula_43 can change value, they can be rewritten as a single axiom:\n\nformula_50\n\nIn words, this formula states: \"given that it is possible to perform action formula_26 in situation formula_27, the fluent formula_43 would be true in the resulting situation formula_10 if and only if performing formula_26 in formula_27 would make it true, or it is true in situation formula_27 and performing formula_26 in formula_27 would not make it false.\"\n\nBy way of example, the value of the fluent formula_34 introduced above is given by the following successor state axiom:\n\nformula_61\n\nThe properties of the initial or any other situation can be specified by simply stating them as formulae. For example, a fact about the initial state is formalized by making assertions about formula_62 (which is not a state, but a \"situation\"). The following statements model that initially, the robot carries nothing, is at\nlocation formula_63, and there are no broken objects:\n\nformula_64\n\nformula_65\n\nformula_66\n\nThe foundational axioms of the situation calculus formalize the idea that situations are histories by having formula_67. They also include other properties such as the second order induction on situations.\n\nRegression is a mechanism for proving consequences in the situation calculus. It is based on expressing a formula containing the situation formula_10 in terms of a formula containing the action formula_26 and the situation formula_27, but not the situation formula_10. By iterating this procedure, one can end up with an equivalent formula containing only the initial situation formula_7. Proving consequences is supposedly simpler from this formula than from the original one.\n\nGOLOG is a logic programming language based on the situation calculus.\n\nThe main difference between the original situation calculus by McCarthy and Hayes and the one in use today is the interpretation of situations. In the modern version of the situational calculus, a situation is a sequence of actions. Originally, situations were defined as “the complete state of the universe at an instant of time”. It was clear from the beginning that such situations could not be completely described; the idea was simply to give some statements about situations, and derive consequences from them. This is also different from the approach that is taken by the fluent calculus, where a state can be a collection of known facts, that is, a possibly \"incomplete\" description of the universe.\n\nIn the original version of the situation calculus, fluents are not reified. In other words, conditions that can change are represented by predicates and not by functions. Actually, McCarthy and Hayes defined a fluent as a function that depends on the situation, but they then proceeded always using predicates to represent fluents. For example, the fact that it is raining at place formula_73 in the situation formula_27 is represented by the literal formula_75. In the 1986 version of the situation calculus by McCarthy, functional fluents are used. For example, the position of an object formula_73 in the situation formula_27 is represented by the value of formula_78, where formula_79 is a function. Statements about such functions can be given using equality: formula_80 means that the location of the object formula_73 is the same in the two situations formula_27 and formula_83.\n\nThe execution of actions is represented by the function formula_9: the execution of the action formula_26 in the situation formula_27 is the situation formula_87. The effects of actions are expressed by formulae relating fluents in situation formula_27 and fluents in situations formula_87. For example, that the action of opening the door results in the door being open if not locked is represented by: \n\nThe predicates formula_91 and formula_92 represent the conditions of a door being locked and open, respectively. Since these condition may vary, they are represented by predicates with a situation argument. The formula says that if the door is not locked in a situation, then the door is open after executing the action of opening, this action being represented by the constant formula_93.\n\nThese formulae are not sufficient to derive everything that is considered plausible. Indeed, fluents at different situations are only related if they are preconditions and effects of actions; if a fluent is not affected by an action, there is no way to deduce it did not change. For example, the formula above does not imply that formula_94 follows from formula_95, which is what one would expect (the door is not made locked by opening it). In order for inertia to hold, formulae called \"frame axioms\" are needed. These formulae specify all non-effects of actions:\n\nIn the original formulation of the situation calculus, the initial situation, later denoted by formula_7, is not explicitly identified. The initial situation is not needed if situations are taken to be descriptions of the world. For example, to represent the scenario in which the door was closed but not locked and the action of opening it is performed is formalized by taking a constant formula_27 to mean the initial situation and making statements about it (e.g., formula_95). That the door is open after the change is reflected by formula formula_100 being entailed. The initial situation is instead necessary if, like in the modern situation calculus, a situation is taken to be a history of actions, as the initial situation represents the empty sequence of actions.\nThe version of the situation calculus introduced by McCarthy in 1986 differs to the original one for the use of functional fluents (e.g., formula_78 is a term representing the position of formula_73 in the situation formula_27) and for an attempt to use circumscription to replace the frame axioms.\n\nIt is also possible (e.g. Kowalski 1979, Apt and Bezem 1990, Shanahan 1997) to write the situation calculus as a logic program:\n\nformula_104\n\nformula_105\n\nHere formula_106 is a meta-predicate and the variable formula_107 ranges over fluents. The predicates formula_6, formula_109 and formula_110 correspond to the predicates formula_6, formula_112, and formula_113 respectively. The left arrow formula_114 is half of the equivalence formula_115. The other half is implicit in the completion of the program, in which negation is interpreted as negation as failure. Induction axioms are also implicit, and are needed only to prove program properties. Backward reasoning as in SLD resolution, which is the usual mechanism used to execute logic programs, implements regression implicitly.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2256132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2256132", "title": "José Joaquín de Arredondo", "text": "José Joaquín de Arredondo\n\nJosé Joaquín de Arredondo y Mioño (also known as Jose Arredondo y Miono Pelegrin y Oceja) (1776–1837) was a 19th-century Spanish and Mexican soldier who served during the last two decades of Spanish rule in New Spain. He was military commandant of the Texas province during the first Texas revolutions against Spanish rule.\n\nJose de Arredondo was born in Barcelona, Spain, in 1776 to Nicolás Antonio de Arredondo y Pelegrín and Josefa Rosa de Mioño. His father served as Governor of Cuba and as Viceroy of Buenos Aires.\n\nArredondo entered the Royal Spanish Guards as a cadet in 1787 and was detached for service in New Spain. In 1810 he was promoted to the rank of colonel and given the command of the infantry regiment of Vera Cruz. In 1811 he was made military commandant of Huasteca and governor of Nuevo Santander. Arredondo enforced a rigid interpretation of the Laws of War regarding guerrillas, partisans and insurgents. He applied his rules of warfare in proactive campaigns against Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla's revolt of 1811 and the criollos revolts of 1813, taking part in Ignacio Elizondo's plot to capture Miguel Hidalgo. Arredondo was rewarded for his actions in suppressing the revolutionaries with an appointment as commandant of the eastern division of the Provincias Internas (comprising the provinces of Coahuila, Texas, Nuevo Santander and the New Kingdom of León); the region had a predominantly royalist population (see below), and the independence movement would not be supported by a majority of the population in those provinces until the late 1810s, after Servando Teresa de Mier's fight for Mexican independence.\n\nAs part of the New Kingdom of León, the area of Texas then called Tejas was a bulwark against the large-scale marauding attacks of hostile Indian nations such as the Apaches and the Comanches. Because of long-term hostility between the Indians and the Europeans in the area, much of the New Kingdom of León and Tejas had a population almost wholly European in origin, unlike other parts of New Spain. Spanish authorities supported the settlement of Tejas, the frontier of the Kingdom between Indian territory and the growing American nation. Thus, while the southern areas of the New Kingdom of León remained royalist, the northern areas were mostly ambivalent about supporting either the revolution or the royalist cause. This neutrality disappeared when independence fervor spread among the population following brutal suppression tactics by the Spanish colonial authorities and the threat of an even more absolutist government in the province.\n\nIn 1811, José Bernardo Maximiliano Gutiérrez de Lara, an idealistic mestizo blacksmith from Nuevo Santander, dedicated himself to the Hidalgo Independence movement. With his substantial contacts in the region and his personal militancy he received a commission as a Lt. Colonel in Hidalgo's Army of the Americas and traveled to Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia to enlist aid supporting his own goals for the independence movement in Texas. In Washington and Philadelphia he met Caribbean adventurer José Álvarez de Toledo y Dubois who was wanted by Spanish authorities in Texas. Upon both his departure and then his return trip through the Neutral Ground on the Texas-Louisiana border, Gutiérrez was encouraged by numerous sympathetic factions who supported the revolutionary cause. In Natchitoches, which had a long-standing predominantly American settlement, he made plans to invade the rest of Texas from the east. He enjoined another adventurer and former US Army Lieutenant, Colonel Augustus William Magee, to carry out the mission in the field. William Shaler, later an American consul to Havana, Europe and Algiers, as well as a writer, was attached to Gutiérrez's expedition by the United States government to oversee the revolutionaries' invasion of Spanish Texas. Shaler, a friend of Secretary of State Robert Smith, had been appointed by President James Madison as a confidential agent; he advised Gutiérrez and Magee with the direct involvement of upper levels of the American government as high as Secretary of State James Monroe; officially, however, the United States maintained a stance of disapproving the invasion.\n\nFrom their headquarters in the Neutral Ground, Gutiérrez and Magee openly advertised for revolutionary recruits from Louisiana and Texas for the \"Republican Army of the North\". They mustered them to participate in the Gutiérrez-Magee Expedition and adopted a solid emerald green flag, thought to have been introduced by Colonel Magee, who was of Protestant Irish descent. Volunteers were offered forty dollars a month and a square league (4,428 acres) of to-be-captured land. From San Antonio the Texas governor, Manuel María de Salcedo, followed developments through his intelligence network and lobbied intensively for more aid from his superiors and comrades-in-arms south of the Rio Grande to prepare for the invasion and limit distribution of rebel propaganda. Governor Salcedo was treated condescendingly by his protocol-oriented and bureaucratic uncle, Commandant General Nemesio Salcedo.\n\nOn 12 August 1812, the Republican Army of the North, consisting of about 150 men, crossed the Sabine River and took Nacogdoches with little opposition. Capt. Bernardino Montero, the commander of Nacogdoches, was unable to recruit a single civilian militiaman for the royalist cause, as the majority of the province erupted in support of the fledgling independence movement. When he retreated toward San Antonio, all but ten of his soldiers deserted and joined the revolutionary army. By late fall the Republican Army of the North controlled the area between the Sabine and Guadalupe Rivers.\n\nAfter receiving reinforcements and conducting negotiations, Salcedo and Lt. Governor Muñoz de Echavarria deployed along the Guadalupe River east of San Antonio to meet the invading Republican Army. Learning of this, Gutiérrez and Magee turned south down the Guadalupe River valley, proceeded to La Bahia where they took control without much resistance; soon after Gov. Salcedo began a prolonged siege of the Presidio La Bahia where the rebels were grouped. Neither side could budge the other, tying up the meager forces of both armies.\n\nFollowing several weeks of attrition warfare, stalemate, and negotiations, Col. Magee died under uncertain circumstances, probably related to actions by Gutierrez, who didn't trust him. Meanwhile, Gov. Salcedo and Col. Simon Herrera had lifted the siege and returned to San Antonio, leading to a further loss of confidence among the royalists and more defections. The main Republican army, now commanded by Virginian Col. Samuel Kemper, who had taken over after Magee's death, and buttressed by more recruits from the Neutral Ground and allied coastal Lipan and Tonkawa Indians, had moved along the San Antonio River towards the capital city of San Antonio, where they defeated Col. Herrera's royalist forces at the Battle of Rosillo Creek (also known as the Battle of Rosalis or the Battle of Salado Creek). When the Republican Army moved toward San Antonio, Gov. Salcedo composed a twelve-point plan of honorable surrender and delivered it to Col. Gutiérrez, who was encamped at Mission Concepcion.\n\nThe terms of the surrender were refused by Guttierrez, who ordered the execution of Herrera and several other officers even as they dined with several of the Anglo-Tejano and American officers. Gutierrez then released all the other rebel prisoners, formed a provisional government with himself as governor, and organized a tribunal which found Salcedo and Herrera guilty of treason against the Hidalgo movement, condemning them to death. The Anglo officers protested the decision and endeavored to convince the self-appointed generalissimo and governor to spare them and send them either to prison in southern Mexico or to exile in Louisiana. Instead, the prisoners were placed under the escort of the Mexican rebel Capt. Antonio Delgado who summarily executed them along with 12 others and mutilated the corpses, leaving them lying at the site without burial; even going so far as to steal their belongings. Delgado returned to San Antonio, where he boasted of the butchery, which was announced publicly on the military parade grounds.\n\nThe brutal atrocity of these events sickened most of the Anglo-Tejano and American forces supporting the independence movement; all the Anglo officers and recruits were horrified, and a party of them rushed to the execution site and gave the victims a Christian burial. Subsequently, most of the Anglo-Tejano and American officers immediately abandoned the cause and returned to eastern Texas, Louisiana and further points east. Samuel Kemper, James Gaines, Warren D.C. Hall and others were so shocked they took furloughs and returned to Nacogdoches. Nonetheless, the appeals of Col. Miguel Menchaca and other Mexican leaders persuaded some to stay and continue fighting for the cause of Mexican independence.\n\nOn 6 April 1813, Gutiérrez declared the province of Texas independent of Spain and on 18 April proclaimed the first Constitution of Texas, which was more Centralist than Republican. This only further demoralized the remaining Anglo-Tejano and American volunteers, who provided the backbone of the army. The Republican Army of the North, through influence of the putatively independent state of Texas, now initiated its plans for full-scale independence and prepared to meet a counter-offensive from the south, where outrage over the execution of Salcedo and Herrera caused previously neutral criollo forces to join the loyalist troops.\n\nTo meet the threat represented by the recently separated province, the Spanish crown appointed General José Joaquín de Arredondo to command the Eastern and Western Divisions of the Provincias Internas. He quickly re-organized the royalist forces, appointed new officers, drilled his troops, and awaited for additional supplies while planning for a vast implementation of his counter-insurgency tactics. The anger of the royalist criollos toward the Gutierrez regime, however, was such that many wanted quick and violent retribution by marching toward San Antonio to capture and execute the first \"President Protector of the State of Texas.\"\n\nConsequently, Lt. Col. Ignacio Elizondo, a one-time rebel who had been repelled by the revolutionaries' dishonorable behavior and now fought for the royalists, organized a volunteer regiment of criollos in June. Against orders, he marched his force toward San Antonio to engage the Republican Army. On 16 June, the Republican Army, under an Anglo-Tejano called Henry Perry, met and routed Elizondo's forces, which suffered 400 men killed and many prisoners taken at the Battle of Alazan Creek outside San Antonio. He retreated to the Rio Grande, where he was reprimanded by Gen. Arredondo, who nevertheless joined forces with him.\n\nMeanwhile, the high-handed methods of Gutierrez, the mistreatment of the Spanish loyalists, and the anti-Republican policies of the Gutierrez regime had resulted in a total loss of confidence in President Gutierrez amongst the Anglo-Tejano and American community. On 4 Aug 1813, Gutiérrez was deposed by these elements, who installed their chief propagandist, a formal naval officer and member of the Spanish Cortes from Santo Domingo, José Álvarez de Toledo y Dubois.\n\nWith the Texas government paralyzed by these events, Arredondo launched his campaign. Arredondo now had about 1,800 troops in his army, buttressed with criollos who were provoked by the senseless slayings of Salcedo and his company. He immediately left for San Antonio de Bexar, resolved to apply his concepts of counter-insurgency warfare on the entire Tejano population. Heavily supplied for a long campaign, his army marched forth.\n\nOn Aug 18, 1813, under José Álvarez de Toledo y Dubois the Army of the North and the Royal Spanish forces under Arredondo met in the four-hour-long Battle of Medina. The Spanish Army completely destroyed the 1,400-man Army of the North. Arredondo listed enemy casualties as 600 killed, and several hundred were captured. Arredondo summarily gathered the names of the captured men, executed the rank and file, and tortured the officers for further information and then executed them, and ordered their corpses or parts of their bodies hung in trees. No effort was made to bury the remains of the Republican Army's dead, which lay on the battlefield for nine years. He later revised the number to 1,000 killed. In San Antonio, he quickly rounded up the families of the Texian soldiers, and had some of them publicly executed in the plaza of San Antonio and their heads posted on the plaza's perimeter. He spent the next year pursuing the remaining rebel leaders, including the civilian leadership of the Texas Republic, sparing few, and destroying all of the farms, buildings, and mills of the province except for a few located in San Antonio and newly built citadels such as that near Goliad. The approximately 2,500 men killed in the Republican Army's campaign exceeded the total number of Texians killed during the entire Texas Revolution twenty-three years later in 1836, and the death or expulsion of at least 3,000 other Anglo-Tejano and American settlers resulted effectively in an ethnic cleansing of the entire province.\n\nAfter his victories, Arredondo appointed Cristóbal Domínguez as interim governor, and having completing his assignment in Texas, returned south to Monterrey. He subsequently crushed the filibustering expedition of Francisco Javier Mina by overrunning his defenses at the village of Soto la Marina in October 1817. He remained the primary military commander of the Coahuila and Texas area for the next several years.\n\nThe utter crushing of the Texas province had removed the primary obstacle to the marauding Indian nations further north. Between 1817 and 1821, expeditions of Comanche and Apache Indians numbering several thousand penetrated deep into the provinces further south of Texas. Ravaged by the war of Independence and the subsequent Indian raids, the Kingdom of León fell backward in wealth and population, and along with the rest of Mexico essentially entered into a period of intense depression and anarchy.\n\nConsequently, on January 17, 1821 General Arredondo approved the petition of Moses Austin to bring three hundred settlers into an area of in Texas. They were required officially to convert to Catholicism and provide arms and men for defending the routes into Mexico further south, although only one tenth of the settlers ever converted. Later, this settlement was expanded to encourage more emigration by Americans from the United States into northern Mexico.\n\nWhen Mexico achieved independence from Spain, Arredondo offered on July 3, 1821 to swear fealty to the new government if he could retain his office as commandant general; his offer was rejected by the citizens of Saltillo, and Agustín de Iturbide's \"Plan de Iguala\" for Mexican independence led to his removal from power. Arredondo is remembered in Texas history as a \"butcher\" because of his executions of republicans.\nWhen Mexico achieved independence from Spain, Arredondo endorsed the Plan of Iguala and swore allegiance to the Republic of Mexico on July 3, 1821. He surrendered his command, went into retirement in Havana, Cuba, and died in 1837 shortly after Texas had gained its independence.\n\n\n"}

It is organized for educational and scientific purposes with a mission to \"advance the science of vertebrate paleontology and to serve the common interests and facilitate the cooperation of all persons concerned with the history, evolution, comparative anatomy, and taxonomy of vertebrate animals, as well as field occurrence, collection, and study of fossil vertebrates and the stratigraphy of the beds in which they are found.\" SVP is also concerned with the conservation and preservation of fossil sites. SVP publications include the \"Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology\", the \"SVP Memoir Series\", the \"News Bulletin\", the\"Bibliography of Fossil Vertebrates\" and most recently \"Palaeontologia Electronica\".\n\nSVP was founded as an independent society in 1940 by a group of scientists who had formed the 'section of vertebrate paleontology' in the Paleontological Society six years earlier. Among the founding members were George Gaylord Simpson, who was nine years later also a founding member of the Society for the Study of Evolution, and Alfred Sherwood Romer. SVP's members wanted to maintain a strong focus on evolution and zoology at a time when the Paleontological Society was becoming increasingly biostratigraphic and industry focused. SVP's first president was Al Romer (served 1940-41), and its current president is P. David Polly (served 2016-18). In the last ten years, four out of six of SVP's presidents have been women (Annalisa Berta, Catherine Badgley, Blaire Van Valkenburgh, and Catherine Forster) as are the current president (Emily Rayfield) and president-elect (Jessica Theodor).\n\nSVP considers that \"vertebrate Fossils are significant nonrenewable paleontological resources that are afforded protection by federal, state and local environmental laws and guidelines\", and that scientifically important fossils, especially those found on public land, should be held in the public trust, preferably in a museum or research institution, where they can benefit the scientific community as a whole. The Paleontological Resources Preservation Act. S. 546 and H. R. 2416 were introduced in the US Congress with the support of SVP. SVP has also been involved in legal action to protect the original boundaries of Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears national monuments, both of which were established to provide protection for paleontological resources.\n\nThe ethics by-law of SVP states \"The barter, sale, or purchase of scientifically significant vertebrate fossils is not condoned, unless it brings them into or keeps them within a public trust.\" Because of this, SVP has advocated that scientifically important fossils, such as the theropod skeleton auctioned in Paris in 2018, be placed in public trust repositories like those at major museums and universities.\n\nThe position of the SVP is that \"The fossil record of vertebrates unequivocally supports the hypothesis that vertebrates have evolved through time\" and that evolution is \"the central organizing principle of biology, understood as descent with modification\" and is important to geology as well. The Society believes only scientifically supported evolutionary theory should be taught in school and that creationism and intelligent design have no place in the scientific curriculum. To this end, SVP has set up programs to train educators in teaching evolution.\n\n\nThe SVP issues the following awards, grants and prizes:\n\n\n\n"}

It is estimated to have grown from \"a tiny cluster of shebeens around an open market into a thriving boomtown with around 5,000 to 8,000 inhabitants over a period of 10 years\".\n\nThe Oshikango area was heavily affected by the 1966 to 1989 South African Border War between South Africa and its allied forces (mainly UNITA) and the Angolan government and the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO). The war ended with South Africa agreeing to Namibian independence. In 1996 Oshikango, along with many other settlements in the area, was proclaimed a village with the aim of increasing border trade.\n\nThe border post between Namibia and Angola has brought business opportunities to Oshikango and the surrounding area. With the help of the European Union an Export Processing Zone consisting of 14 warehouses was established there. The nearby village of Omafo, now a suburb of Helao Nafidi, hosts an annual trade show.\n\nThe parallel prevalence of land owned by the village of Oshikango, the town of Helao Nafidi, and land under traditional jurisdiction has led to uncertainties about ownership that had to be settled in court.\nThere are some manufacturing companies in Oshikango, for example Fatima Plastic which donated Engela hospital the cost of building a bridge after a flood. Chicco, a building material wholesaler, has also set up shop in Oshikango, and there are also large retailers like Pick n Pay and Fysal Fresh Produce. Most villagers however, still mainly survive by agriculture and face the risk of periodic drought.\n\nIn mid-2005, the second stage of the new Northern Railway between Oshikango and Oshivelo began construction. By mid-2006, it had reached Ondangwa. A train service known as the \"Omugulugwombashe Star\" traveled weekly on this track until the locomotives broke down after a few rounds of service. In 2008, a short extension across the border was proposed to bypass the congested border post.

McLaglen and starring John Wayne, Katharine Ross and Jim Hutton. Is about a group of oil well firefighters, based loosely on the life of Red Adair. Adair, \"Boots\" Hansen, and \"Coots\" Matthews served as technical advisers on the film.\n\n\"Hellfighters\" was for the most part negatively received.\n\nChance Buckman is the head of a Houston–based oil well firefighting outfit. With a team that includes Joe Horn, Greg Parker, and George Harris, Chance travels around the world putting out blazes at well heads from industrial accident, explosion or terrorist attack. Chance enjoys the thrills, but longs for ex-wife Madelyn. She divorced him 20 years earlier, taking their daughter Letitia with her, because Madelyn could not bear to see her husband risk his life. Though they love each other, Madelyn could not deal with her terror that Chance might burn to death in a fire.\n\nWhile extinguishing a burning wellhead, Chance suffers a near-fatal accident when he is crushed by a bulldozer blade. Against his wishes, his daughter Letitia (Tish) visits him in the hospital, summoned by his old friend and former firefighting partner Jack Lomax and fetched by Greg Parker in The Buckman Company's corporate jet. She also pursues Greg Parker to a well fire in Louisiana. (Greg has a notorious reputation for using fires to pick up women. Generally, any woman he takes to a fire ends up in bed with him.) In the case of Buckman's spitfire of a daughter, however, after considerable initial friction Greg and Tish fall in love and marry five days after their first meeting. In spite of Greg's reputation, Buckman comes to trust his daughter's choice and accepts Greg into the family. Madelyn, projecting her own fears onto her daughter, though gracious is rather less accepting, despite her liking for Greg.\n\nGreg suspects that his new father-in-law is growing increasingly protective of him after the marriage in an effort to protect his daughter from heartbreak should her new husband be harmed or killed. Tish wishes to see the fires that her husband and father fight, something that neither man encourages. Her father relents and allows her to accompany Greg into the field.\n\nChance, trying to re-unite with his ex-wife, leaves The Buckman Company to accept an executive position with his old friend Jack Lomax on the board of directors of Lomax Oil as a way to win her back. Chance gives his company to his son-in-law as a \"wedding present\", although Greg's pride compels him to tell Buckman he \"doesn't want any gifts\" and that he will \"pay \"twice\" what it's worth.\" Greg and Tish begin traveling the world to put out oil fires. Soon the older couple announce that they will remarry, to the delight of Tish. Madelyn is happy to see her husband in a safe job, but before too long Chance becomes bored with corporate life and longs to be back in the field. As Jack Lomax earlier told Tish, \"Your father is the best there is at what he does. No man can walk away from that.\"\n\nGreg encounters problems with a fire in Venezuela: five oil wells in a tight line burning all at once, further compounded by guerrillas who are trying to undermine the operation. He asks Chance to return and help fight the fire. Chance does so without hesitation. Buckman goes to Venezuela in a Texas Air National Guard transport full of firefighting gear, unaware that Madelyn and Tish have followed him to Caracas. Madelyn uses Jack Lomax's influence with the President of Venezuela to get herself and Tish to the oilfield where the fire is burning. Madelyn declares \"This is it for me,\" in the sense that it will either make or break her ability to deal with the fires once and for all, fully aware that her relationship with Chance is on the line. \n\nThe Hellfighters put out the fires with the help of the Venezuelan Army while under attack by rebel warplanes that strafe the oilfield. Madelyn explodes in anger at what she perceives as the Venezuelans' inability to protect the team from the unexpected air raid, railing at the Venezuelan army and civil officials for allowing the guerrillas to get close enough to attack. Chance pulls her away during her tirade. She snaps, \"Damned if I understand your attitude!\", to which he replies, \"It's very simple — you'll do.\" When Greg asks Tish for her take on it, she just smiles and says, \"I think we ought to get her a tin hat,\" referring to the bright red hardhats with The Buckman Company logo worn by the Hellfighters.\n\n\nRed Adair had been fighting fires since 1946. He was well known in the industry but became more generally known in 1962 after extinguishing a Sahara Desert gas well fire called \"the devil's cigarette lighter\". Clair Huffaker wrote an original script which was bought by Universal in February 1967. Robert Arthur was assigned to produce. John Wayne agreed to star in November 1967. \n\nWayne made the film after \"The Green Berets\". It reteamed him with Andrew McLaglen, with whom Wayne had made \"McLintock!\" (1963), and Jim Hutton, who had been in \"The Green Berets\".\n\nThis was the first film for which Wayne was paid $1 million. Unlike many of Wayne's films around this time it was not made for his own company. \n\nMuch of the filming took place on the Snodgrass Ranch just outside of Casper, Wyoming.\n\nDuring filming, a catering truck crashed into Wayne's trailer while the star was inside. However, he was not injured.\n\n\"Hellfighters\" received mostly negative reviews, garnering a 14% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" described the film as a \"slow moving, talkative, badly plotted bore\". A. H. Weiler of \"The New York Times\" wrote that John Wayne made \"actionful, if not stirringly meaningful, child's play of exotic disasters\" and remarked that \"the unrestrained cast and director maintain a welcome sense of humor\".\n\n\n"}

The specific epithet \"julibrissin\" is a corruption of the Persian word \"gul-i abrisham\" (گل ابریشم) which means \"silk flower\" (from \"gul\" گل \"flower\" + \"abrisham\" ابریشم \"silk\").\n\n\"Albizia julibrissin\" was described by Antonio Durazzini. John Gilbert Baker used the same scientific name to refer to Prain's \"Albizia kalkora\", the \"Mimosa kalkora\" of William Roxburgh.\n\n\"Albizia julibrissin\" is known by a wide variety of common names, such as Persian silk tree and pink siris. It is also called Lenkoran acacia or bastard tamarind, though it is not too closely related to either genus. The species is called Chinese silk tree, silk tree or mimosa in the United States, which is misleading - the former name can refer to any species of \"Albizia\" which is most common in any one locale. And, although once included in \"Mimosa\", neither is it very close to the Mimoseae. To add to the confusion, several species of \"Acacia\", notably \"Acacia baileyana\" and \"Acacia dealbata\", are also known as \"mimosa\" (especially in floristry), and many Fabaceae trees with highly divided leaves are called thus in horticulture.\n\nIts leaves slowly close during the night and during periods of rain, the leaflets bowing downward; thus its modern Persian name shabkhosb (شب‌خسب) means \"night sleeper\". In Japan its common names are nemunoki, nemurinoki and nenenoki which all mean \"sleeping tree\". Nemu tree is a partial translation of \"nemunoki\".\n\"A. julibrissin\" is a small deciduous tree growing to tall, with a broad crown of level or arching branches. The bark is dark greenish grey in colour and striped vertically as it gets older. The leaves are bipinnate, long and broad, divided into 6–12 pairs of pinnae, each with 20–30 pairs of leaflets; the leaflets are oblong, long and broad. The flowers are produced throughout the summer in dense inflorescences, the individual flowers with small calyx and corolla (except the central ones), and a tight cluster of stamens 2–3 cm long, white or pink with a white base, looking like silky threads. They have been observed to be attractive to bees, butterflies and hummingbirds. The fruit is a flat brown pod long and broad, containing several seeds inside.\n\nThere are two varieties:\n\nOriginal habitats of the tree include regions from Iran (Persia) and the Republic of Azerbaijan to China and Korea.\n\n\"A. julibrissin\" is widely planted as an ornamental plant in parks and gardens, grown for its fine leaf texture, flowers and attractive horizontal canopy. Other positive attributes are a fast growth rate, low water requirements and the ability to thrive planted in full sun in hot summer climates. It is very frequently planted in semi-arid areas like California's Central Valley, central Texas and Oklahoma. Although capable of surviving drought, growth will be stunted and the tree tends to look sickly. As such it should be given infrequent, deep waterings during the summer, which will benefit growth and flowering. \n\nThe broad crown of a mature tree makes it useful for providing dappled shade. The flower colour varies from white in \"A. julibrissin\" f. \"alba\", to rich red-tipped flowers. Variants with cream or pale yellow flowers are also reported. Other cultivars are becoming available: 'Summer Chocolate' has red foliage ageing to dark bronze, with pale pink flowers; 'Ishii Weeping' (or 'Pendula') has a drooping growth habit.\n\nThere is also a form, \"A. julibrissin\" f. \"rosea\" (pink silk tree) which has, in the past, been classed either as a variety or as a cultivar. This is a smaller tree, only growing to 5–7 m (15-25 ft) tall, with the flowers always pink. Native to the northeast of the species' range in Korea and Northern China, it is more cold-tolerant than the typical form, surviving temperatures down to at least -25 °C. The selected cultivar \"A. julibrissin\" 'Ernest Wilson' (also known as 'E.H.Wilson' or 'Rosea') is a cold-tolerant tree with deep pink flower colour. In Japan, \"A. julibrissin\" f. \"rosea\" is often used for non-traditional bonsai. The name \"nemunoki\"*(Jap. ねむの木, Kanji: 合歓木) and its variants is a \"kigo\" representing the summer in haiku, especially a sleepy summer evening.\n\n\"A. julibrissin\" f. \"rosea\" has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit; likewise the cultivar 'Summer Chocolate'.\n\nThe sweet-scented flowers are a good nectar source for honeybees and butterflies.\n\nThere is conflicting information on the toxicity of pods and seeds to humans and animals; some parts of the plant may contain neurotoxin. Consult with a medical professional expert before eating or feeding.\n\nIn the wild, the tree tends to grow in dry plains, sandy valleys, and uplands. It has become an invasive species in the United States. It has spread from southern New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, west to Missouri and Illinois, and south to Florida and Texas. It is cultivated in California and Oregon. Its seeds are numerous and they are fertile even over long periods of drought. Each pod, which resembles a flattened bean pod made of paper, contains an average of 8 seeds. The pods burst in strong winds, and the seeds carry over surprisingly long distances.\n\nBreeding work is currently under way in the United States to produce ornamental plants which will not set seed and can therefore be planted without risk. However, in the eastern United States it is generally a short-lived tree, being highly susceptible to mimosa vascular wilt, a fungal disease caused by a species of \"Fusarium\", though the disease does not seem to have seriously impacted its populations. Because of its invasive tendencies and disease susceptibility, it is rarely recommended as an ornamental plant in the US, though it is still widely planted in parts of Europe.\n\n"}
{"id": "2256172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2256172", "title": "Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)", "text": "Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)\n\nJack O'Lantern is an alias used by several fictional supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nJack O'Lantern first appeared in \"Machine Man\" #19 (Feb 1981).\n\nThe original version of Jack O'Lantern was Jason Macendale, a disgraced ex-CIA agent working as a freelance mercenary who later went to use the Hobgoblin mantle himself.\n\nThe second version of Jack O'Lantern was introduced as an enemy of Captain America and Spider-Man.\n\nThis version of the character was subjected to much controversy, due to the fact that several years after his introduction he was rebranded \"Mad Jack\" and was heavily featured in the pages of \"Spectacular Spider-Man\" during the late 1990s. Mad Jack was ultimately revealed to be the duo of Daniel Berkhart (ex-Mysterio) and Maguire Beck (Mysterio's cousin). It was not until the one-shot \"New Avengers Most Wanted\" (a character compendium) that the second iteration was confirmed as a separate entity: Steven Mark Levins. However, the character's name would not be used in-story until \"Ghost Rider\" vol. 5 #10 (2007).\n\nThis incarnation was a professional criminal, and a partner of Blackwing. Alongside Blackwing, he searched Skullhouse and first battled Captain America. With Blackwing, he was then admitted as a provisional member of the loosely knit band of the Red Skull's operatives called the Skeleton Crew.\n\nSoon after that, Jack O'Lantern fought Crossbones and Diamondback, and captured Diamondback. Diamondback tried to escape, and Jack O'Lantern fought Diamondback in mid-air. He was ultimately defeated in combat by the Falcon, and taken to the Vault.\n\nHe also worked as an enforcer of the Golem and in this capacity, fought the Hood when he interfered in Golem's machinations.\n\nJack O'Lantern later fought Union Jack alongside Shockwave and Jackhammer to attack the Thames Tunnel.\n\nFollowing his defeat, Levins was recruited to serve as part of the Thunderbolts hero-hunting squad during the \"Civil War\" storyline. While pursuing Spider-Man through the Manhattan sewers alongside the Jester, Levins was killed when the Punisher shot Levins in the head, killing him instantly. However, death would not be the end of Levins's story. His headless corpse was reanimated and possessed by a fragment of Lucifer's soul. He and now exhibits the ability to detach, levitate and explode his head (now replaced with a real life pumpkin) among other powers. However, the Ghost Rider was able to exorcise him by ripping his heart from his chest, setting it aflame and putting it back in his chest, causing it to explode inside.\n\nDuring the \"Dark Reign\" storyline, Levins was among the dead characters seen in Erebus by Hercules. He was later seen on Pluto's jury (alongside Abomination, Armless Tiger Man, Artume, Heinrich Zemo, Commander Kraken, Iron Monger, Kyknos, Nessus, Orka, Scourge of the Underworld, and Veranke) for Zeus' trial.\n\nDuring the \"\" storyline, Levins's Jack O'Lantern form was among the characters that were cloned by the Jackal. He got involved in a fight with the other cloned villains, causing the Prowler's clone to break it up.\n\nJack O'Lantern later battled Deadpool after stealing 20 million dollars from the \"Queen Kathleen\" gambling ship owned by Tombstone.\n\nThere were two people who assumed the Mad Jack alias while wearing the Jack O'Lantern costume:\n\n\nIn the miniseries \"Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do\", Francis Klum purchased Mysterio's weapons and gimmick in order to be yet another new Mysterio. The seller, the Kingpin, said he had acquired the arsenal \"from Jack-O-Lantern\".\n\nA fourth version of Jack O'Lantern is introduced during the \"Dark Reign\" storyline is an unnamed man who claimed to be Steve Levins' brother. He has since been caught by the police after killing the 15 year old daughter of his neighbor and drinking his victim's blood as part of his plot to avenge Steve. This man was shown to be able to transform into a Jack O'Lantern-headed villain using the powers of a mystical demon. Detective Tom and Detective Steve interrogated the man. When asked about the pact with the demon, the man transformed into his Jack O'Lantern form where he is now surrounded by bats. When Detective Tom states that he is getting the electric chair, Jack O'Lantern states that he's just biding his time until his \"dark lord\" arrives to set him free. He was later released by a lawyer sent by Norman Osborn who claimed that Jack O'Lantern is a material witness to a national security case. The lawyer drives away with Jack O'Lantern as Norman plans to gain his services.\n\nDuring the \"Heroic Age\", Steve Rogers knew about Jack O'Lantern, noting that Osborn didn't use Jack O'Lantern and suspects that Jack O'Lantern will continue his crusade to avenge his brother.\n\nA new version of Jack O'Lantern appears working for the third Crime Master. As a child, the kid that would become Jack O'Lantern had disobeyed his parents and mistreated animals. While going as Jack O'Lantern for Halloween, he came across a house that Crime Master was in. The boy was taken under Crime Master's wing and trained him to be an assassin. It was with this training that the boy had killed his parents.\n\nOne of his jobs brings him into conflict with the government operative Venom. During this conflict, Venom threw a live grenade into his mouthpiece and it dislocated his jaw. Even after the explosion, he was still able to run and retreat. Later, Crime Master is able to use contacts to discover Venom's true identity Flash Thompson, and has Jack O'Lantern kidnap Betty Brant (Flash's girlfriend) in exchange for Venom letting Crime Master get a shipment of Antarctic Vibranium. When Venom leaves to rescue Betty, he is distracted by Spider-Man's appearance, which drives the Venom symbiote into an uncontrollable rage. Eventually Betty is rescued at the last second by Spider-Man, with Venom then trying to recapture Crime Master. However, Venom is attacked by Jack O'Lantern who proclaims Flash as his first real nemesis, and desiring revenge for the disfiguring grenade explosion, also mockingly calling out Venom's first name. While it hasn't been confirmed, this depiction claims to have killed every other person to go by the Jack O'Lantern name in an effort to \"clean up the brand\". Jack O'Lantern is a member of the Crime Master's Savage Six.\n\nJack O'Lantern in his human guise goes first and targets Betty only to end up fighting Venom. During the fight, Megatak assists Jack O'Lantern and punches Venom's phone before he can make a call to the Avengers for help. Jack O'Lantern targets Jessie Thompson and ends up fighting Venom. Venom grabs Jack O'Lantern's gun and fires on him before Jack O'Lantern spews acid on him, causing Venom to cool down in the fountain.\n\nJack O'Lantern later goes on a killing spree which escalated on Father's Day. Venom tracked him to a sewer thanks to the hidden trail Jack O'Lantern had left behind for him. There, he discovered that Jack had dug up the corpse of Flash's father and blew up the room. In the fight that ensued, it looked like Jack O'Lantern was going to win until Venom took his father's gun from the holster and shot him. Venom chose not to kill Jack O'Lantern.\n\nJack O'Lantern was incarcerated at the Raft. He managed to continue his operations using an employee of a storage facility as a replacement who Jack O'Lantern's robots brainwashed.\n\nDuring the \"AXIS\" storyline, Jack O'Lantern appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against the Red Skull's Red Onslaught form. His moral compass was inverted with all of those in Genosha when a spell meant to affect only the Red Skull affected everyone on the island. He later rejoined the (now-inverted) villains to prevent the inverted X-Men from detonating a gene bomb which would've killed everyone on Earth who was not a mutant. When a reinversion spell was cast, Jack O'Lantern was evil once again.\n\nDuring the \"\" storyline, Jack O'Lantern was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Jack O'Lantern appears as a member of the Army of Evil where they attack Manhattan in retaliation for what happened at Pleasant Hill.\n\nJack O'Lantern is eventually hunted down for his many crimes by Eddie Brock, and is beaten within an inch of his life. Brock lets him live, although it is implied Brock breaks Jack's spine and leaves him in a critical condition before being teleported away to a parallel universe.\n\nJack O'Lantern was hospitalized following this, and underwent plastic surgery to restore his face and intensive therapy. Jack O'Lantern was released to civilian life, but grew bored almost immediately and returned to supervillainy. Following Deadpool to Wakanda, Jack O'Lantern battles both Deadpool and Black Panther until Deadpool shot him in the head, killing him.\nThere have been different unnamed imposters of Jack O'Lantern:\n\n\nSteven Levins modeled his Jack O'Lantern costume and equipment after those created by his predecessor Jason Macendale. Levins wore a complete body armor made of metal-mesh covered in multi-segmented Kevlar panels, incorporating a rigid, articulated shell which can resist a 7-pound bazooka anti-tank warhead. He wore a bulletproof helmet with an internal three hour, compressed air supply. The helmet is equipped with a telescopic infrared image-intensifier for seeing in the dark and 360 degree scanning device for seeing all around himself. The base of the helmet is equipped with a fine network of pinholes which maintain a low temperature, low density flame (\"stage-fire\") that rings the helmet at all times. The air supply cools the helmet's interior. The helmet is padded to protect his head from injury. Levins is armed with wrist-blasters which can deliver an electrical shock within a range of . He also used various types of grenades, including anesthetic, lachrymatory (tear gas), hallucinogenic, and regurgitant gas grenades, smoke grenades, and concussion grenades. The grenades are shaped like spheres or pumpkins. He can fire small grenades from wrist devices. He can also release \"ghost-grabbers\" which are thick, semi-transparent films which adhere to a victim. Levins rides atop a one-man hovercraft with an electric motor powered by a high density lithium rechargeable battery.\n\nDaniel Berkhart used the same weapons as the previous incarnations of Jack O'Lantern, along with chemical weapons that cause psychedelic and mind-bending hallucinations. His accomplice Maguire Beck was an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master hypnotist, and skilled in chemistry and robotics, including a lifelike robotic black cat. Beck has used her advanced knowledge of computer imaging and virtual reality to improve upon Mysterio's techniques, allowing for Beck to pretend to be Mad Jack via proxies while safely hidden in her secret lair.\n\nThe brother of Levins can transform into a demon with the head of a jack-o'-lantern using the powers of an unknown mystical demon.\n\nThe fifth incarnation, along with the same general weapons the previous ones used, has a fleet of tiny flying cartoon-styled devil robots. Instead of a hovercraft, he rides a jet-powered \"broomstick\".\n\nIn the MC2 timeline, Maguire Beck is that Spider-Ham character to lure Spider-Man to the Heartland Entertainment building. Once there, Spider-Man met up with Araña, and together they battled robots created by Jack O'Lantern. Years later, Maguire lured Spider-Girl to the same location. After fighting several Jack O'Lanterns, Spider-Girl finished them off and discovered that Maguire was really a robot.\n\nOn the day before Halloween 13 years after the Chaos! event, Jack O'Lantern launched a scheme to bring about a hell on Earth and take over the world with the proper alignment of cosmos. Raising dead persons and animating dinosaurs, he looked to gather the remaining heroes of the world for the purpose of eliminating them. However, Brother Voodoo (Jericho Drumm) and the Supernaturals were able to overcome his machinations, sending Jack into another dimension. With Jack gone, his minions disappeared and the world was saved. Jack O'Lantern may still be holding the heroes captured from the first Chaos! event in his wand and plotting another takeover of the Earth.\n\nJack O'Lantern is among the enthralled villains defending Krona's stronghold when the heroes assault it. Tasmanian Devil is shown pushing some rocks onto him.\n\nIn the \"Spider-Geddon\" event on Earth-11580, a version of Jack O'Lantern is seen alongside the Green Goblin, Hobgoblin and Demogoblin during the Goblin Night. Under the orders of the Goblin Queen, they try to kill Gwen Stacy, but Spiders-Man arrives and defeats the Goblins.\n\n\n\n"}

As a school boy he was instructed in art by Oswald Brock. He left high school during the depression working as a junior poster artist at Hackett Offset Printing Company before becoming a designer and illustrator for a furniture manufacturer, Corkhill & Lang (later Frazer's Furniture). During this time he continued studying commercial art at night at East Sydney Technical College. He then worked as a furniture artist and salesman at Grace Bros. before joining the armed forces in 1941, where he served in the Australian Army, First Artillery Survey Regiment, and then the RAAF, where he attained the rank of Leading Aircraftman (34 Squadron).\n\nAfter the war he spent three years studying under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme, completing his arts course at East Sydney Technical College, during which time he produced his first comic strip, \"Sword and Sabre\", a story about the French Foreign Legion. Wedd sold it to Syd Nicholls' publishing company, where it appeared as three monthly episodes in the \"Middy Malone\" magazine. Wedd also produced eight more comic strips for Nicholls, including \"Bert and Ned\" and \"Captain Justice\" (a bushranger who righted wrongs). After Nicholls closed his comic line, Wedd began supplying comics to Elmsdale Publications, including \"Tod Trail\" and \"Kirk Raven\". In December 1950 New Century Press contracted Wedd to produce twenty three \"Captain Justice\" stories, with the hero now located in the American Wild West, for £102 per issue.\n\nThroughout the 1950s Wedd also worked extensively as a cover artist on numerous 'pulp fiction' novels published by Malian Press, Action Comics Pty Ltd and Whitman Press.\n\nIn 1954 he returned to Emsadle where he created \"The Scorpion\", for which he was paid £160 per issue. It became a best-seller with sales of up to 100,000 per issue, despite being banned in Queensland, apparently on the grounds that the bad-guy protagonist kept escaping his just deserts to fight another day.\n\nHe then produced a series of \"Captain Justice\" stories for Calvert Publications, but they had to be largely re-drawn to satisfy 1950s censorship rules and regulations, e.g. the hero's face could not be entirely hidden, no flashes could issue from guns, no character could carry an offensive weapon in the hand, and no-one was allowed to be killed. He also wrote and illustrated eight books for Calvert about a war-time American, \"Kent Blake of the Secret Service\". Wedd then created strips for \"Stamp News\" (on the history of the stamp) and for Dr T.S. Hepworth's \"Australian Children's Newspaper\", drawing many full page adventure comics, an association which lasted for sixteen years. From 1958 he was a regular contributor to \"Chuckler's Weekly\" and for Telegraph Newspapers, with \"Captain Justice\" and \"King Comet\".\n\nAfter producing another five \"Captain Justice\" stories for Horwitz Publications in 1963, Wedd turned to animation, working for Artransa and Eric Porter on series such as \"Marco Polo Junior Versus the Red Dragon\", \"Charlie Chan\", \"The Lone Ranger\", \"Rocket Robin Hood\" and \"Super Friends\". \"Captain Justice\" appeared in the \"Woman's Day\" magazine in September 1964, where it ran until April 1965.\n\nFrom 1965 through to 1966 Wedd produced the cartoon mascot 'Dollar Bill', which appeared in a series of educational cartoons for the Decimal Currency Board, as part of the public information campaign about Australia's switch to decimal currency in 1966.\n\nOn leaving the animation field Wedd concentrated on freelance work and production of a new comic strip based on the life of Ned Kelly. Wedd was in great demand during Captain Cook's Bicentenary celebrations, creating historic strips, illustrations and cards for everything from TV series to Minties and washing powder between 1969 and 1970. The original plans for \"Ned Kelly\" were to run it for 25–30 weeks however Wedd approached the \"Sunday Mirror\" with a proposal to produce a detailed examination of Kelly's life on an open-ended basis. The strip ran uninterrupted for two years. Wedd retired from comics in July 1977, after working on the \"Ned Kelly\" comic strip for 146 weeks. Replacing \"Ned Kelly\" was another Wedd strip about bushrangers, \"Bold Ben Hall\", which followed the same approach and format, running for 400 episodes. This was subsequently followed with another equally long running strip, \"The Birth of a Nation\", devised to coincide with Australia's bicentennial celebrations in 1988. The strip was syndicated to several newspapers, and was later issued as a two-volume book, \"The Making of a Nation\", (self-published by Wedd) in 1988.\n\nWedd's work has appeared in a range of Australian newspapers, including Sydney \"Daily Mirror\", \"Sunday Telegraph\", \"The Sunday Territorian\" and \"Sunday Mail\".\n\nWedd is a long time member and former vice-president of the Black and White Artists' Club, and lives at Williamtown, New South Wales. In 1993 he was awarded an Order of Australia for his services as author, illustrator and historian. He won Stanley Awards in 1987 and 1989. In 2004 he received the Jim Russell Award for \"significant contribution\" to the cartooning industry from the Australian Cartoonists Association.\n\nWedd married Dorothy and they had four children, more than 20 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. In 1960 the couple founded a museum dedicated to the Australian military at their home at Narraweena, on Sydney's northern beaches. When they ran out of space it was moved and rebuilt at their property in Williamtown, New South Wales. The Monarch Historical Museum re-opened at its current location in November 1988. Wedd died on 4 May 2012 at a nursing home in Fingal Bay, New South Wales.\n\n\n"}

At 99th Street, IL 1 ends at an interchange with I-57 (exit 357).\n\nThe northern portion of the Vincennes Trace or Vincennes Trail, an Indian trail which ran some to Vincennes, Indiana, was called Hubbard's Trace or Hubbard's Trail since it connected Fort Dearborn in Chicago with Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard's more southerly trading outposts. It took on the name State Road after some state-funded improvements. Vincennes Avenue, one of Chicago's rare diagonal streets, is a vestige of the Vincennes Trace, and further south the trail eventually became IL 1. In its early days, State Road was unpaved and known for having mud so deep it was jokingly said that it could suck down a horse and buggy.\n\nThe Hubbard Trace was a wagon trail laid out by Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard after he opened a trading post in Danville in 1828, located east of a former Kickapoo village. The trail went north through Hoopeston (Chicago Road) to Watseka, named after Hubbard's Potawatomi wife Watch–e–kee. From there the trail led to Hubbard and Noel La Vasseur's fur warehouse and trading post in Momence, named for Potawatomi chief Momenza. It then went north to Beecher and Blue Island, eventually becoming Vincennes Avenue and State Street to Fort Dearborn south of the Chicago River. \nIL 1 was commissioned in 1918 as SBI Route 1. The original route had extended further along the northern end into Chicago along Vincennes Avenue and Michigan Avenue, and on the southern end from Norris City to Metropolis.\n\nWhen US 45 was established from Norris City to Metropolis, IL 1 shifted east to Cave-In-Rock, replacing a part of Illinois Route 140 in the process. Kentucky Route 91 continues across the Ohio River.\n\nIn 1937, IL 1 was shifted southeast away from Albion to directly connect Mount Carmel and Grayville. Eventually, IL 15 and IL 130 replaced IL 1 to Albion.\n\nIn the 1950s, a freeway, then known as the Calumet Expressway, was constructed south from Chicago. This was designated IL 1, while the old highway along Halsted Street was signed Alternate IL 1 (Alt. IL 1). By 1964, IL 1 was restored to its old alignment, and IL 394 was applied to the expressway south of the portion designated as I-94 (the I-94 portion now being known as the Bishop Ford Freeway). At this time, IL 1 was discontinued north of I-57.\n\nMost of IL 1 north of Danville was part of the western division of the Dixie Highway, which goes through downstate Illinois and enters the Chicago area as it passes through Beecher. From here it follows the Vincennes Trail north and splits into the Bishop Ford Freeway (formerly the Calumet Expressway) and Chicago Road (one of the original roads into Chicago from the south). The Dixie Highway follows Chicago Road through Crete (where it is known as Main Street), Steger and South Chicago Heights (where it shares a junction with Sauk Trail).\nAs IL 1 continues north, it has a junction with Lincoln Highway (US 30) in Chicago Heights. This is sometimes known as the \"Crossroads of the Nation\", because it is the intersection of two major auto trails. This intersection helped cities such as Chicago Heights thrive in its early days. Approximately two blocks after this intersection, Dixie Highway splits from Chicago Road and continues north through Flossmoor and Homewood. At the north end of Homewood's downtown, the road turns and goes under the Illinois Central Railroad tracks, which now carries both the Metra Electric Line and Amtrak trains. The road continues north through East Hazel Crest and past the Markham Rail Yards and under the Tri-State Tollway.\n\nPast the tollway, the road enters Hazel Crest, Markham and then Harvey. As the road continues, creating a border between the towns of Dixmoor and Posen, its name changes to Western Avenue.\n\nWhen the road enters Blue Island, it splits into two streets, (Western and Gregory), and realigns itself into one when it reaches Burr Oak Avenue. The road then enters the city of Chicago. Through Chicago, Western Avenue is a major boulevard, which continues north through the city to the town of Evanston (where it is named Asbury Street), which is where the Dixie Highway ends.\n\n"}

In the , Dajarra had a population of 191 people.\n\nDajarra is in North West Queensland near the border with the Northern Territory. It is about south of Mount Isa on the Diamantina Developmental Road (also known as the Boulia Mount Isa Highway). The town is close to the intersection of the Diamantina Developmental Road with the Duchess Dajarra Road.\n\nThe town takes its name from the Dajarra railway station assigned by the Queensland Railways Department on 21 June 1916, and is reportedly an Aboriginal word referring to an isolated mountain nearby. It was formerly known as Carbine Creek. The railway station was on the Dajarra railway line which connected Dajarra to Cloncurry via Duchess and reached Dajarra on 16 April 1917. This line was intended as part of the proposed Great Western Railway which would connect Sydney in New South Wales through to Darwin in the Northern Territory; however, the next section of the line from Dajarra towards Camooweal was started but never completed.\n\nDajarra once had importance as a railhead for the cattle industry, the railway giving connection to the ports and markets of the east coast of Australia. Dajarra Post Office opened on 7 November 1919 (a receiving office had been open from 1917).\n\nThe older people of the area who remember Dajarra's heyday say that the area trucked more cattle than Texas in the United States of America. Cattle drovers on horseback would bring cattle from as far away as Western Australia to put them on the train at Dajarra.\n\nDajarrra State School opened in 1920.\n\nCompeting road transport eventually captured the cattle market and Dajarra railway station closed when the line from Duchess closed on 1 January 1994.\n\nMore recently, some opportunities for local employment have come with the development of the nearby Phosphate Hill phosphate mine and fertilizer production plant. The mining company has assisted the community in developing a better water supply for the town.\n\nThe town has a rich Aboriginal heritage and is home to Aboriginal tribes from around the Diamantina River, the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Northern Territory.\n\nIn the there were 429 people living in Dajarra.\n\nDajarra State School is a government primary (Early Childhood-6) school for boys and girls at Matheson Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 27 students with 4 teachers and 5 non-teaching staff (3 full-time equivalent). An Aboriginal language is taught at the school, along with how to make boomerangs, what wood to use and what timber is best for didgeridoos. The children are also taught where to find bush foods and the 'bush lollies' on the gidyea trees after rain, and other traditional foods.\n\n"}

{"id": "2256200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2256200", "title": "Opel Blitz", "text": "Opel Blitz\n\nOpel Blitz (German for \"lightning\") was the name given to various light and middle-weight truck series built by the German Opel automobile manufacturer between 1930 and 1975. The original logo for this truck, two stripes arranged loosely like a lightning symbol in the form of a horizontally stretched letter \"Z\", still appears in the current Opel logo.\n\nDuring the years preceding World War II Opel was Germany's largest truck producer. The \"Blitz\" name, coined in a prize competition, was first applied to an Opel truck in 1930. As part of the Nazi economy and the German re-armament efforts the authorities ordered the construction of the \"Opelwerk Brandenburg\" facilities in 1935, and through 1944 more than 130,000 \"Blitz\" trucks and chassis were produced. \n\nBy 1934 there were four versions offered of the 1 tonne basic model along with fourteen versions of the larger 2 and 2½ tonne trucks. The medium-weight versions originally were equipped with a flathead 68 HP petrol engine coming from the 1930 GM Buick Marquette, replaced in 1937 with a modern overhead valve 75 HP straight-six engine also used in Opel Admiral passenger cars. This engine was very similar to Chevrolet engines from the same period, to the point that disabled Blitzes abandoned by fleeing Germans could be easily put back into operation by advancing Allies using Chevy/GMC and Bedford parts.\n\nFrom 1939, the \"Blitz 3.6\" three-ton version was used in large numbers by the German \"Wehrmacht\" armed forces throughout World War II. Variants included an elongated version and the four-wheel drive \"Blitz A\". To cope with the bad road conditions and the \"rasputitsa\" mud seasons on the Eastern Front, a half-tracked \"Maultier\" (mule) \"Sd.Kfz. 3\" version was built using tracks and suspension based on the Universal Carrier. Among others, these were used as service vehicles for the \"Messerschmitt Me 323\" military transport aircraft. \n\nThe light basic model was manufactured as \"Blitz 2.5\" in Rüsselsheim until 1942 and again from 1946, equipped with the 55hp Opel Super 6 engine. On 6 August 1944, the \"Opelwerk Brandenburg\" was devastated by an RAF air raid. Furthermore, until the end of the war, about 2,500 \"Blitz 3.6\" trucks were built by order of Minister of Armaments Albert Speer at the Mannheim plant of the rival Daimler Benz AG, while the production of its own Mercedes-Benz L3000 model had to be discontinued. After the war, the facilities in Brandenburg were completely dismantled at the behest of the Soviet Military Administration, while Daimler-Benz in Mannheim resumed building the \"Blitz 3.6\" under the designation \"L 701\" until 1949. The last 467 medium trucks were again assembled by Opel in Rüsselsheim until production finally discontinued in 1954 without a successor.\n\nIt is claimed that Opel, a subsidiary of GM, used forced labor to build the Blitz. The degree to which the US branch of GM controlled Opel at the time is subject to debate, but by production numbers alone, it is evident that Opel was heavily involved in production of trucks and other equipment for the Nazi war machine.\n\nThe Opel Blitz was one of the vehicles (along with Renault, Saurer and Magirus based vehicles) used by Germans in The Holocaust as a modified carbon monoxide gas van.\n\nAfter the end of the war, with the Brandenburg plant dismantled and transported to the Soviet Union, and 47% of the buildings in Rüsselsheim destroyed, former Opel employees began to rebuild the Rüsselsheim plant. The first postwar Blitz was completed on 15 July 1946 in the presence of United States Army General Geoffrey Keyes and other local leaders and press reporters.\nThe first post-war designed Blitz in 1952 was a modern rounded design, reminiscent of the contemporary GMC and Chevrolet pickup trucks. The new 1.75 ton truck was offered with a van and pickup body. The new model retained the pre-war chassis with the straight-six petrol engine. Opel remained the market leader for light trucks despite strong competition especially by the newly designed 1955 Mercedes-Benz L 319 model and the Ford FK series, as well as Hanomag and Borgward vans. A coach version was built by the Karl Kässbohrer Fahrzeugwerke from 1953 to 1956. The 1.75 to model was a very popular fire engine (LF8-TS), typically equipped with an engine driven pump mounted at the front bumper and a second, portable pump in the back of the truck. The portable pump was powered by a 34 hp Volkswagen engine and weighed about 400 lbs. Firetruck conversions were made by companies such as Ziegler, Metz and Rosenbauer. \n\nIn 1960, the 1.9 to with 2.6 L engine replaced the previous 1.75 to model. This model (later dubbed Opel \"Blitz A\") was distinguished by a cab forward design and a revised six cylinder engine, leading to less overall length and more cargo space. Due to the powerful engine, the truck was an excellent performer for its time, and the 1.9 to with 2.6 L engine was like his predecessor a common base for a light fire truck. The configuration was similar to the one described above for the 1.75 to. However, commercial sales of this model declined during the production run, mainly due to the lack of an economic Diesel option. \n\nThe Opel \"Blitz B\" was launched in 1965, and was the last of the Opel Blitz trucks. To improve fuel economy, this model was available in 1.9 liter four cylinder CIH option. Alternatively, a 2.5 liter six-cylinder version of the new CIH engine series could be ordered. These engines were also available in the contemporary Rekord and Commodore models, but the Blitz engines had a stronger ground construction and was de-tuned for more torque and better economy.\n\nUnder pressure from strong competition of the popular Mercedes-Benz T2 model, in 1968, Opel finally offered a 2,100 cm³ Indenor XDP 4.90 diesel engine (the Peugeot 504 engine) - too late to regain lost market shares. Opel GM decided not to develop a successor, and in 1975, the production of Opel commercial vehicles finally ceased.\n\nAccording to the corporate policy of General Motors, from 1973 to 1987 a successor vehicle produced by Bedford Vehicles of Luton, and based on the Bedford CF, was sold in some markets as the \"Bedford Blitz\". Since 1998 Opel again offers a light commercial vehicle with the \"Movano\" model based on the Renault Master.\n\n"}

It is the southernmost river in the Crocodile River (West) basin.\n\nThe Jukskei begins in Ellis Park in Johannesburg. Its original spring was on the former Doornfontein farm, which measured at 18,000 liters per hour, but has since disappeared under subsequent urban development. Now the first surface expression of the Jukskei is in Bertrams at the intersection of Queen Street and Sports Avenue where it emerges from a storm drain. From there the river flows through Bezuidenhout Valley and Bruma. It then meanders in a northerly direction through Bedfordview and Edenvale before flowing through Alexandra Township. It then turns northwest and flows through Modderfontein, Buccleuch, Leeuwkop Prison, Lone Hill, Dainfern and Steyn City before joining the Crocodile River (Limpopo) outside Lanseria.\n\nThe Jukskei River is joined by numerous streams along its course with its major tributaries being the Modderfontein Spruit, Braamfontein Spruit and Klein Jukskei River. The Jukskei River provides the largest amount of water, by discharge, into the Crocodile River (Limpopo) Basin.\n\nThe Jukskei is mostly shallow and not deep enough for transportation. It is also heavily polluted by urban runoff. Lack of infrastructure maintenance has let raw waste flow into the river on a daily basis. Cholera-causing bacteria have occasionally been found in the river. The river receives a large inflow from the Northern Waste Water Treatment Plant in northern Johannesburg. The Jukskei River is one of the largest contributing factors of the eutrophication problems facing Hartbeespoort Dam further down stream. Tons of waste such as plastic, metal and rubber flow down the river annually.\n\nThe banks are prone to bursting, especially in summer when rainfalls are the heaviest for the year regionally. This spells disaster for the impoverished residents of the Alexandra Township who often build makeshift shacks along the river banks owing to overcrowding and the need for access to water for washing, drinking, and cooking.\n\nThe Jukskei traditionally demarcated the boundary between the \"Northern Transvaal\" and \"Transvaal\" for sporting purposes, and teams like the Titans cricket team and Blue Bulls (formerly \"Northern Transvaal\") continue to be headquartered in Pretoria, north of the Jukskei.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2256247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2256247", "title": "Spendthrift trust", "text": "Spendthrift trust\n\nA spendthrift trust is a trust that is created for the benefit of a person (often unable to control his spending) that gives an independent trustee full authority to make decisions as to how the trust funds may be spent for the benefit of the beneficiary. Creditors of the beneficiary generally cannot reach the funds in the trust, and the funds are not actually under the control of the beneficiary.\n\nThe creator of a trust is often called the \"trustor\", \"grantor\", or \"settlor\" of the trust. A trust generally will not be treated as a spendthrift trust unless the trust agreement contains language showing that the creator intended the trust to qualify as spendthrift. This is what is known as a spendthrift clause or spendthrift provision.\n\nA spendthrift provision creates an irrevocable trust preventing creditors from attaching the interest of the beneficiary in the trust before that interest (cash or property) is actually distributed to him or her. Most well-drafted irrevocable trusts contain spendthrift provisions even though the beneficiaries are not known to be spendthrifts. This is because such a provision protects the trust and the beneficiary in the event a beneficiary is sued and a judgment creditor attempts to attach the beneficiary's interest in the trust.\n\nThe protection of the spendthrift trust extends solely to the property that is in the trust. Once the property has been distributed to the beneficiary that property can be reached by a creditor, except to the extent the distributed property is used to support the beneficiary. If a trust calls for a distribution to the beneficiary, but the beneficiary refuses such distribution and elects to retain property in the trust, the spendthrift protection of the trust ceases with respect to that distribution and the beneficiary's creditors can now reach trust assets.\n\nSome creditors may compel payment out of the trust, particularly those who supply the beneficiary with \"necessaries\" (usually food and shelter, but sometimes clothing and transportation, if these are not extravagant). Most jurisdictions also permit the invasion of spendthrift trust assets to satisfy awards of child support and alimony.\n\nA trust created by an individual for his or her own benefit is sometimes called a \"self-settled trust\", and may be a kind of asset-protection trust. If the creator of a self-settled trust is also a beneficiary of the trust, particular problems arise regarding the protection of assets from creditors, and the prevention of fraud, that is, the possibility that the creator of the trust seeks to defraud creditors.\n\nTo prevent individuals from creating trusts to defeat their own creditors, the laws of most states provide that a spendthrift clause in a trust document does not protect the beneficiary to the extent that the beneficiary is also the person who created the trust. The settlor does not need to be either the sole settlor or the only beneficiary of the trust. As long as the settlor is a beneficiary of the trust to any extent, to that extent the trust will be deemed self-settled. For example, Texas law provides:\n\nFurther, laws in some states (like Texas) are worded so broadly that anyone transferring property to the trust might be deemed to be a \"creator\" (i.e., settlor, grantor, or trustor), not merely the person or persons who originally set up the trust.\n\nHowever, several states have changed their laws to provide that a person may create a self-settled spendthrift trust (i.e., a spendthrift trust for his or her own benefit). Such trusts are also called Domestic Asset Protection Trusts (\"DAPT\"), and sometimes informally called \"Alaska trusts\", as Alaska was a pioneer in allowing this kind of spendthrift trust. However, because of the danger of the misuse of Alaska trusts to defraud creditors, the legality of such trusts (to the extent that they purport to protect the trust share of a beneficiary who is also a creator of the trust) is uncertain in the states not allowing self-settled spendthrift trusts.\n\nNevada has enacted a series of statutes, codified at Chapter 166 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, that specifically enable the creation of self-settled spendthrift trusts. This form of trust is commonly referred to as a \"Nevada Asset Protection Trust\". Under Chapter 166, an individual can serve as the settlor, trustee, and beneficiary of the trust. This network of laws is specifically designed to protect trust assets from the claims of any creditor. NRS 166.170 specifically limits the circumstances under which a creditor may bring a claim. If a creditor existed at the time of the property's transfer to the trust, then the creditor must bring its claim against the trust within 2 years after the transfer or within six months after the creditor reasonably should have known of the transfer, whichever is later. NRS 166.170(1). If the creditor's claim surfaces after the transfer is made, the creditor must bring its claim within two years after the transfer, regardless of notice. NRS 166.170(1). Moreover, the creditor can only sustain its claim if it can prove by clear and convincing evidence (a tough evidentiary standard) that the transfer was made as a fraudulent conveyance. NRS 166.170(3).\n\nThe extent to which sister states will recognize the asset protections of these DAPTs, like those created under the laws of Nevada and Alaska, is unclear due to a somewhat sparse body of relevant case law. While states are generally compelled to honor and recognize the laws of sister states, pursuant to the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution, some of these laws may be in direct conflict with the laws of other states. Some of these DAPT laws can be quite expansive. The scope of the Nevada law is drawn quite broadly to govern Nevada's enforcement of all trusts created within or outside the state, so long as they meet certain limited criteria. See NRS 166.015(1). The law goes on to require that the statutes be applied to the enforcement by any other state of any spendthrift trust created within Nevada, so long as the law is not in direct conflict with the other adjudicating state. NRS 166.015(3). In fact, the Nevada law does not even require that the trust assets be located within Nevada, so long as one of the trustees declares his/her domicile as Nevada. NRS 166.015(1)(d).\n\nThe following other states now have a DAPT statute: Delaware, Mississippi (as of July 31, 2014, see Miss. Code 91-9-701 et seq.), South Dakota, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Oklahoma, Colorado, Missouri, Rhode Island and New Hampshire.\n\nBecause estates and trusts are largely governed by state law in the United States, individual states each may have their own statutory or common law treatments of spendthrift clauses and trusts.\n\nFor example, the Nevada Property Code provides:\n\nIn Texas, the Texas Property Code provides:\n\nA clause in the terms of a trust agreement that complies with the above-quoted statute is an example of what the law calls an \"anti-alienation provision.\"\n\nTo continue with the example of the Texas law, the Texas Property Code further provides:\n\nThe above-quoted language essentially means that a trust instrument does not (at least, in Texas) have to contain complex legal jargon to qualify the trust as \"spendthrift\"; simply using the word \"spendthrift\" in the trust document may be sufficient.\n"}

William Stukeley interviewed her in 1727 after Newton's death when she was 'Mrs Vincent' a widow of 82 years. He wrote: \"Sir Isaac & she being thus brought up together, it is said that he entertain'd a passion for her, when they grew up: nor dos she deny it.\n\nAt about dawn on August 14, 1682 looking westward over the Patuxent River near Hunting Creek, Arthur Storer apparently saw what is now known as Storer's Comet. The comet stayed visible in the area until September 18, 1682. \n\nStorer's observations of the comet are considered to be the most accurate of his contemporaries with the exception of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.\n\n"}

Originally part of the main road between central Johannesburg and Pretoria, it runs along through the north-eastern parts of the city from Hillbrow to Sandton, passing through numerous older suburbs, including Houghton and Orange Grove, before it becomes the Pretoria Main Road (later Pretoria Main Road) (R101) which passes Alexandra Township and continues to Midrand and Pretoria.\n\nLouis Botha Ave begins at the top of the Johannesburg CBD in the suburbs of Hillbrow and Berea and then heads north-east passing through Houghton to the north and Yeoville and Bellevue to the south. In Houghton it passes close to the private boys schools of St John's College (1889) and King Edward VII school (1911). After this point the road curves and is ominously nicknamed \"Deathbend\" due to the number of car accidents at the spot. The route then enters the suburb of Orange Grove passing the new Victory Theatre (2007), the older one torn down in 2005 which has its origins a cinema in 1929 and renamed after the end of World War Two as the Victory and became a theatre in the early nineties. Radium Beer Hall is on the right. Midway through Orange Grove, the road bends northwards and passes through Orchards and Sydenham and smaller suburbs of Maryvale, Forbesdale, Cheltondale, Rouxville and Hawkins Estate. The road then crosses the M20 at Atholl Road in the suburbs of Highlands North and Waverly. The road crosses Corlett Drive in Bramley before ending a short distance later at Artwright Avenue in the light industrial suburb of Wynberg with the old township of Alexandra close by. The road still designated the M11, continues on though as the Pretoria Main Road.\n\nThe roadway originates as far back as 1876 as a wagon track connecting the farms south of the ridge with South African Republic's (ZAR) capital, at Pretoria. The road would pass through Halfway House (now known as Midrand) before heading to Pretoria. Halfway House was laid out in 1890 and became the halfway mark between the two towns on the Zeedeberg coach route. The roadway has its beginnings at the apex of triangular piece of unused government land at \"Randjelaagte\" in what is now the suburbs of Hillbrow and Berea. The apex is remembered by the \"Randjelaagte Beacon\" at the top of Clarendon Place. The road then headed north-east along the boundaries of the old Witwatersrand farms \"Klipfontein\" to the north and \"Doornfontein\" to the south before peeling away through the former as it drops down from the ridge crossing the small \"Lemoen Spruit\" (Orange Grove Spruit) and into the northern valley. At the bottom of the ridge the road would pass the \"Lemoen Plaas\" a farm where travelers would rest. Gold was discovered south of the ridge in 1886 and by 1889 a hotel called the Orange Grove Hotel appeared close to the old farm and was an excursion point for the early town residents. During the Second Boer War, after the British Army captured Johannesburg, a British block-house was built alongside the road near the bottom of the ridge overlooking the valley protecting the town from the Boer forces. It was still visible in 1909.\n\nThe land around this area, called Alexandra Estate would be renamed as Orange Grove in 1904 and the suburb was laid out by the African Realty Trust. In 1909 a tram line from Johannesburg would be laid down the road and would terminate in the suburb of Sydenham. The old Pretoria road obtained its existing name in 1917 when it was named after the prime minister and Boer-War general, Louis Botha. On 3 July 1917, the Federation of Ratepayers Association recommended to the City of Johannesburg that two main roads in Johannesburg be named after Louis Botha and Jan Smuts, in honour of their service to the British Empire during World War One. The council voted and Morgan Road and Pretoria Main Road became Louis Botha Avenue.\n\nA largely business street, there are some problems on Louis Botha Avenue, including urban decay caused by illegal land uses, such as shebeens. In 2014, construction began on the expansion of Johannesburg's Rea Vaya bus rapid transit system to Louis Botha Avenue.\n"}
{"id": "2256257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2256257", "title": "Chaparral Cars", "text": "Chaparral Cars\n\nChaparral Cars was a pioneering American automobile racing team and race car developer that engineered, built, and raced cars from 1963 through 1970. Founded in 1962 by American Formula One racers Hap Sharp and Jim Hall, it was named after the roadrunner, a fast-running ground cuckoo also known as a \"chaparral bird\".\nDick Troutman and Tom Barnes were builders of the original Chaparral race cars (later referred to as Chaparral 1). Jim Hall purchased two Chaparral 1s to race. When Hall and Sharp began building their own cars, they asked Troutman and Barnes if they could continue to use the Chaparral name. That is why the Hall/Sharp cars are all named Chaparral 2s (models 2A through 2J for sports cars/CanAm cars, and the 2K which was the 1979–1982 Indycar). Despite winning the Indianapolis 500 in 1980, they left motor racing in 1982. Chaparral cars also featured in the SCCA/CASC Can-Am series and Endurance racing.\n\nJim Hall was a leader in the innovation and design of spoilers, wings, and ground effects. A high point was the 1966 2E Can-Am car. The 2J Can-Am \"sucker car\" was the first \"ground-effect\" car.\n\nThe development of the Chaparral chronicles the key changes in race cars in the 1960s and 1970s in both aerodynamics and tires. Hall's training as an engineer taught him to approach problems in a methodical manner, and his access to the engineering teams at Chevrolet and at Firestone was instrumental in changing race car aerodynamics and handling from an art to an empirical science. The embryonic data acquisition systems created by the GM research and development group aided these efforts. An interview with Hall by Paul Haney illustrates many of these developments.\n\nIn 1957, Hall raced the front-engined Chaparral (retroactively called the \"Chaparral 1\") through 1962, bought from Troutman and Barnes (like the Scarab, the Chaparral 1 cars were built in California by Troutman and Barnes). Hall and Hap Sharp extensively modified their Chaparral and eventually decided to build their own car. They obtained permission from Troutman and Barnes to use the Chaparral name, which is why all of Hall's cars are called Chaparral 2s.\n\nThe first Chaparral 2-series was designed and built to compete in the United States Road Racing Championship and other races of the time, particularly the West Coast Pro Series that were held each fall. Hall had significant \"under the table\" assistance from GM, including engineering and technical support in the development of the car and its automatic transmission (this is evidenced by the similarity between the Chevy Corvette GS-II \"research and development\" model and the Chaparral 2A through 2C models).\n\nFirst raced in late 1963, the Chaparral 2 developed into a highly competitive car in the Can-Am series in 1966 and 1967. Designed for the 200-mile races of the Can-Am series, it was also a winner in longer endurance races. In 1965 it shocked the sports car world by winning the 12 Hours of Sebring in a pouring rain storm, on one of the roughest tracks in North America.\n\nThe Chaparral 2 featured the innovative use of fiberglass as a chassis material. The Chaparral 2C had a conventional aluminum chassis.\n\nIt is very difficult to identify all iterations of the car as new ideas were being tested continually.\n\n\nAlongside the development of aerodynamics was Hall's development of race tires. Jim Hall owned Rattlesnake Raceway, located adjacent to his race shop; its proximity allowed him to participate in much of Firestone's race tire development.\n\nA two-article series in \"Car and Driver\" magazine featured Hall's design theories, turning speculation about vehicle handling into applied physics. Hall's theories were the precursor to the elaborate data collection and management of current racing teams.\n\nThe 2D was the first closed cockpit variant of the 2-series, designed for endurance racing in 1966. It won at 1000 km Nürburgring in 1966 with Phil Hill and Joakim Bonnier driving. It also competed in the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, withdrawing after 111 laps. The Chaparral 2D was equipped with a 327 cubic-inch displacement (5.3 liter) aluminum alloy Chevrolet engine producing 420 horsepower; the car weighed only 924 kg.\n\nThe 2E was based on the Chevrolet-designed aluminum 2C chassis and presented Hall's most advanced aerodynamic theories to the racing world in the 1966. The 2E established the paradigm for virtually all racing cars built since. It was startling in appearance, with its radiators moved from the traditional location in the nose to two ducted pods on either side of the cockpit and a large pivoting variable-incidence wing mounted several feet above the rear of the car on struts. As opposed to an aircraft wing, it generated down force instead of lift and was attached directly to the rear suspension uprights, loading the tires for extra adhesion while cornering. A ducted nose channeled air from the front of the car upwards, creating extra down force as well. By depressing a floor pedal that was in the position of the clutch in other cars, Hall was able to feather, or flatten out, the \"normally\" negative-incidence wing's angle when down force was not needed (as on a straight track section) to reduce drag and increase top speed. An interconnected air dam also closed off the nose ducting for streamlining. When the pedal was released, the front ducting and wing returned to full down force position. Until they were banned many race cars, including some in Formula One, had wings on tall struts. The resulting accidents from their failures led to pivoting wings mounted on the suspension prior to being fully banned.\n\nThe 2E scored only one win, at the 1966 Laguna Seca Raceway Can-Am with Hill driving. Hall stuck to an aluminum 5.3-liter Chevrolet engine in his lightweight racer while the other teams were using 6- to 7-liter iron engines, trading weight for power.\n\nThe 2E was a crowd favorite and remains Hall's favorite car.\n\nIn the 2F Hall applied the aerodynamic advances of the aluminum 2E to the older fiberglass chassis closed-cockpit 2D for the 1967 racing season. A movable wing mounted on struts loaded the rear suspension while an air dam kept the front end planted. The radiators were moved to positions next to the cockpit. An aluminum replaced the 5.3-liter engine of the 2D. While always extremely fast, the extra power of the larger engine was too much for the automatic transmission to handle and it broke with regularity. After solving the transmission problems, the 2F scored its only win on 30 July 1967 in the BOAC 500 at Brands Hatch with Hill and Mike Spence driving. After this race the FIA changed its rules, outlawing not only the 2F but also the Ford GT40 Mk.IV (winner at Le Mans that year) and the Ferrari 330 P3/4 (winner, 24 Hours of Daytona) and 365 P4 (finished second, Le Mans). As with the 2D, the 2F raced wearing Texas license plates.\n\nThe 1967 2G was a development of the 2E. It featured wider tires, and a 427-cc aluminum Chevrolet V-8 engine. While on par with its competitors in terms of power, the lightweight 2C chassis was stretched to the limit and it was only Hall's driving skills that kept the car competitive. For the 1968 Can-Am series, still larger tires were added to increase grip.\n\nHall's racing career was effectively ended in a severe crash at the Stardust Grand Prix Can-Am race when he rear-ended the slow moving McLaren of Lothar Motschenbacher, although he did drive in the 1970 Trans-American Sedan Championship while fielding a team of Chevrolet Camaros.\n\nNever one to be complacent, Hall noted that the increasing down force also created enormous drag. Seeking a competitive edge, the 2H was built in 1969 as the replacement for the 2G to minimize drag. However the anticipated gains in speed were more than offset by the reduced cornering speed. It eventually was fitted with a huge wing.\n\nThe most unusual Chaparral was the 2J. On the chassis' sides bottom edges were articulated plastic skirts that sealed against the ground (a technology that would later appear in Formula One). Two fans adapted from a military tank engine were housed at the rear, driven by a single two-stroke twin cylinder engine. The car had a \"skirt\" made of Lexan extending to the ground on both sides, laterally on the back of the car, and laterally from just aft of the front wheels. It was integrated with the suspension system so the bottom of the skirt would maintain a distance of one inch from the ground regardless of G forces or anomalies in the road surface. The skirting produced a zone within which the fans could create a vacuum producing down force on the order of 1.25 to 1.50 G when the car was fully loaded (fuel, oil, coolant). Tremendous gripping power and greater maneuverability at all speeds was produced. Since it created the same levels of low pressure under the car at all speeds, down force did not decrease at lower speeds. With other aerodynamic devices, down force decreased as the car slowed or reached too much of a slip angle.\n\nThe 2J competed in the Can-Am series and qualified at least two seconds quicker than the next fastest car--but mechanical problems limited its success. It ran for only one season, in 1970, after which it was outlawed by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA). Although originally approved by the SCCA, they succumbed to pressure from other teams who argued that the fans constituted \"movable aerodynamic devices.\" Sanctioning body FIA had banned such devices beginning with the 2E. There were also complaints of debris generated by the fans damaging following cars. McLaren argued that if the 2J were not outlawed, the Can-Am series would be ruined by its dominance—something McLaren had been doing since 1967. A similar fan was used in Formula One eight years later on the Brabham BT46B, which won the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, but the company reverted to the fanless BT46 soon afterwards due to concern for rules violation. The car was later deemed to have been within FIA technical specifications.\n\nThe 2K was a Formula One-inspired ground effect Indy car designed by Briton John Barnard. Debuting in 1979 with driver Al Unser Sr., it went on to win six races in 27 starts over three seasons. Its greatest success came in 1980 when Johnny Rutherford won both the Indy 500 and CART championship.\n\nChaparral started fielding Indy cars in 1978 with Al Unser driving the No. 2 First National City Traveler's Checks Lola T500-Cosworth DFX. Unser then managed to win the 1978 Indianapolis 500. Later in the season Unser added wins at the California 500 at Ontario Motor Speedway and the Schafer's 500 at Pocono International Raceway; as of 2013, this remains the only time a driver has won the Fuzzy's Premium Vodka Triple Crown. Despite these wins, Unser lost the championship to Tom Sneva (who failed to win a race). With the formation of CART, Hall fielded Unser in the No. 2 Pennzoil Lola T500-Cosworth DFX. At the 1979 Indianapolis 500, Hall and fellow CART board men Roger Penske, Pat Patrick, Teddy Mayer, Ted Field, and Robert Fletcher were initially not allowed to compete in the race since it was part of the USAC National Championship. At the same time Hall was going to introduce the Chaparral 2K-Cosworth DFX. In the race Unser lead for 89 of the 200 laps but an engine fire on lap 105 ended his participation. He later won the season-ending Miller High Life 150 at Phoenix International Raceway and finished fifth in CART standings but was ineligible for USAC points.\n\nBy 1980 Unser was replaced by Johnny Rutherford after having disagreements with Hall. The only change to 2K was its number, now four. Rutherford won five races that season, including the 1980 Indianapolis 500, the Datsun Twin 200 at Ontario Motor Speedway, the Red Roof Inn 150 at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course; the Norton 200 at Michigan International Speedway, and the Tony Bettenhausen 200 at the Wisconsin State Fair Park Speedway. He also won the 1980 IndyCar and CRL championships. In 1981 Rutherford returned with the No. 1 Pennzoil Chaparral 2K-Cosworth DFX and won the season-opening Kraco Car Stereos 150 at Phoenix International Raceway. The rest of the season proved to be inconsistent as he dropped to fifth in points. The team also competed in the opening round of the USAC Gold Crown season at the 1981 Indianapolis 500. Rutherford led for three laps early on but fuel pump issues ended the team's day after only 25 laps. By the 1982 IndyCar season the 2K was becoming outdated, with its best result in fourth place at the Miller High Life 150. After four races he ranked 18th in points. By the time of the Norton Michigan 500 at Michigan International Speedway, the team was using a March 82C-Cosworth DFX purchased from Bob Fletcher Racing. Rutherford's results managed to improve as he took his season-best finish of third at the AirCal 500K at Riverside International Raceway. Rutherford ended up in 12th place in points that year. The team also competed at the USAC Gold Crown season finale, the 1982 Indianapolis 500, where Rutherford started 12th and finished 8th.\n\nIn the 1991 CART season Hall returned to Indy cars in conjunction with VDS Racing, with the team being called Hall-VDS Racing with John Andretti driving the No. 4 Pennzoil Z-7 Lola T91/00-Ilmor-Chevrolet Indy V8. The team managed to get a victory in their debut, the Gold Coast IndyCar Grand Prix on the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit. The team also got a second-place finish at the Miller Genuine Draft 200 at the Milwaukee Mile. Also, at the 1991 Indianapolis 500 Andretti got a fifth-place finish. At the end of the season Andretti was ranked a career-best eighth in points. In the 1992 CART season Andretti drove the No. 8 Pennzoil Z-7 Lola T92/00-Ilmor-Chevrolet Indy V8 for the team. However, Andretti's best finish came at the Pioneer Electronics 200 at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course where he came in fourth place. At the end of the year Andretti finished eighth in points again. He then left the team at the end of the season to compete in the NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series for Jack Clark. So in the 1993 CART season the team fielded Teo Fabi in the No. 8 Pennzoil Lola T93/00-Ilmor-Chevrolet Indy V8. Fabi's best finish was fourth, at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach on his way to an 11th-place finish in points. In the 1994 CART season Fabi drove the No. 11 Pennzoil Reynard 94i-Ilmor D. Fabi's best results that season were a pair of fourth-place finishes at the at Michigan International Speedway and the at Road America. Fabi went on to end the season ranked ninth in points. At the end of the season he left to drive for Forsythe Racing. For the 1995 CART season VDS dropped out of the venture and the team became known as Hall Racing and rookie Gil de Ferran was signed on to pilot the No. 8 Pennzoil Reynard 95i-Ilmor-Mercedes-Benz IC108. In four of the first six races de Ferran managed to qualify in the top-10. Although he only scored two points during that time. His season soon turned around starting with a pole position at the Budweiser Grand Prix of Cleveland at Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport where he was leading with five laps to go when he collided with the lapped car of Scott Pruett taking him out of the race. De Ferran avenged this later in the season when he won the season-ending Toyota Monterey Grand Prix at Laguna Seca Raceway. He finished 14th in points and won the Jim Trueman PPG IndyCar World Series Rookie of the Year Award. For the 1996 IndyCar season he drove the No. 8 Pennzoil Reynard 96i-Honda Indy V8 and qualified for the pole at the 1996 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. He also won the Medic Drug Grand Prix of Cleveland and finished sixth in the final points standings. Despite the recent success Hall closed up the Indy car team for good, after which de Ferran drove for Walker Racing in the 1997 CART season. In total Hall won 13 races and two championships.\n\nIn 2005, a wing of the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum in Midland, Texas was dedicated to the permanent display of the remaining Chaparral cars and the history of their development. To aid in keeping these cars in an optimal state of performance, they are driven on a semi-regular basis at the museum grounds.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2256263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2256263", "title": "Dominion Textile", "text": "Dominion Textile\n\nThe Dominion Textile Inc. or Domtex was a major Canadian textile manufacturer that was founded in 1905 and closed in 1998 when its remains were purchased by the American Polymer Group, at the time headed by Jerry Zucker.\n\nThe company was formed in 1905 from a merger of four major Canadian textile companies, and it quickly gained a near monopoly in the tariff protected Canadian market. Many of its products were once household names in Canada, such as the Wabasso bedding line, Caldwell towels, and Penman's underwear. Based in Montreal, it was one of Canada's leading companies and had close links to the government. Most of the company's production was based in small towns in Quebec and elsewhere across Canada, in most of these towns the mill was the primary employer. The company was much praised during the Great Depression for keeping employment levels high despite a collapse in prices. During the Second World War the company profited as a major supplier to the Allied war effort.\n\nIn 1948 the economic situation changed dramatically as tariffs between western nations were greatly reduced, and Dominion Textile was exposed to strong competition from the United States and Britain. Dominion Textiles' market share fell dramatically from nearly 100% of the Canadian market in 1947 to only 47% a decade later. The company almost collapsed, but eventually adapted to the new conditions. It was rebranded as Domtex and moved into new areas such as the production of polyester. In the same period it became seen by Quebec nationalists as a prime example of the anglophone businesses that controlled the province. In 1967 FLQ member Jean Corbo died when a bomb detonated prematurely in an attempted attack on a Dominion Textile plant in Montreal.\n\nIn the 1970s the company began to expand abroad, seeking to compete outside Canada. It purchased smaller companies in other nations and built new factories. At its peak in the 1980s it had 14,000 employees and factories in Canada, the United States, Ireland, France, Italy and Tunisia. A leader in a number of areas, it became the world's largest producer of denim.\n\nIn the 1980s the textile industry was again changing, as General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) provisions came into effect that opened the business to competition from low wage developing economies. Domtex tried to adapt. It entered into a long battle to try to get concessions from its unions and closed half its Canadian factories. In 1987 it made a failed bid for American giant Burlington Industries, that would have made it a global textile leader. Over the course of the 1990s the company slowly collapsed, and by 1997 it was left with only two factories. The remnants were bought for some $600 million by the Polymer Group of South Carolina in 1998.\n\nThe Dominion Textiles' buildings appeared once as a key feature in 1981 Frédéric Bach's short animated movie \"Crac!\", relating the industrialization and urbanization of rural Quebec. The Montmorency's factory, near Quebec City, is shown as being built in front of the famous Montmorency Falls. This factory closed in 1987 and burned down twice in 1993 and 1994 after an unsuccessful condominiums project.\n\n"}

It runs from the M31 to the M1, and is indicated as the R24. The Carlton Centre, the 2nd-tallest building in Africa (the tallest office building in Africa), is located on the street, as is the southern end of Newtown. There is little evidence of Commissioner Street's exact origin, although it is known that this street played a role in the development of Johannesburg.\nCommissioner Street has been an important street in Johannesburg since the 1800s and has seen many significant events throughout its history.\n\n\nTwo Chinatowns are located in the city of Johannesburg, the first Chinatown is located on Commissioner Street and the second is in the suburb of Cyrildene. The last remaining shops and restaurants of Johannesburg's first Chinatown are located between buildings 5 and 17 on the western end of Commissioner Street. It was established in the early 20th century when the first Chinese immigrants settled west of Johannesburg and it is estimated that by 1904 there were 180 Chinese businesses operating in the Newtown area. This Chinatown hosts an annual Chinese New Year celebration on Commissioner Street. Since 1994, it has been affected by urban decay and growing levels of crime, reducing its size. It is also getting smaller due to most of the descendants of the original immigrants now being 2nd and 3rd generation South African Chinese who have started to spread out to do business in other parts of the city and country. Many of the original businesses have moved to other areas in Johannesburg or closed down. The \"New Chinatown\" established in Cyrildene consists mainly of recent Chinese immigrants.\n\nDue to its long history, a number of buildings on Commissioner Street have reached the requirements to be protected as national or provincial heritage sites.\n\nIn February 2012, the Premier of Gauteng, Nomvula Mokonyane announced that a proposal to rename Commissioner Street had been brought before the Gauteng Geographical Names Committee. The proposal was to rename the street after Apartheid struggle leader and founding member of the ANC Women's League, Albertina Sisulu. The family of Sisulu welcomed this proposal. As of 2019, the renaming has not yet happened. (only the parallel one-way street, also part of the R24 Route, going the other direction, previously called Market Street, has been renamed after Albertina Sisulu)\n"}

It is located in South Brisbane and occupies most of the block formed by Grey Street, Melbourne Street, Merivale Street, and Glenelg Street. The centre is owned by South Bank Corporation and managed by ASM Global.\n\nDesigned by COX Architecture, the BCEC was constructed by Leighton Contractors, beginning in March 1993 with the demolition of World Expo Park. The building cost $170 million and was mostly funded by the Queensland Government's sale of a casino license, with the remainder funded directly by the government. The centre was completed in May 1995, and opened on 6 June.\n\nThe design of an expansion to BCEC on Grey Street was approved in 2007. Laing O'Rourke was appointed as the project's builder in June 2009 after a delay caused by budget issues, and construction began in 2010. The project was completed in early 2012, and opened on 25 January. It cost $140 million and was funded by the Queensland Government.

She is considered a pioneer in the field of special education.\n\nIn 1912, Devereux began the first Devereux School for Exceptional Children in her home with less than $100. Today, more than 6,000 Devereux staff provides services to tens of thousands of children, adolescents, adults, and their families in 11 states and millions more across the country through public education and prevention programs each year.\n\nDevereux graduated from the Philadelphia High School for Girls in 1904 and from the Philadelphia Normal School for Girls in 1906 where she trained to become a teacher. Upon graduation she began teaching in one of Philadelphia's most underprivileged communities, at the George Washington School in South Philadelphia.\n\nAt a time when very little was known or understood about people with disabilities, Devereux took an interest in “slow learning” children. She recognized early that the public school system was ill-equipped to teach children with mental handicaps. Her intuitive ideas in developing individualized educational programs for children with special needs were far beyond her time. While the system had typically referred to slow learners as “throw-aways” Devereux believed that every child should be given opportunities to learn and achieve personal accomplishments. She believed that special educators are missionaries at heart. Soon, her class became the de facto special education classroom.\n\nIn 1911, Devereux was offered the job of Director of Special Education by the Philadelphia Board of Education, a new position designed to supervise the creation of a special education department. Despite being offered a handsome salary for the time, she turned it down, believing that she could have a greater impact branching off on her own.\n\nAlso in 1911, Devereux received national attention following a visit to her classroom from a reporter. Shortly thereafter, “The First Class of Special Education in an Elementary School in Philadelphia” was published. Following the publication about her teaching methods, Devereux was contacted by a parent in South Carolina, interested in entrusting her challenged son to Devereux's care. For $200, Devereux agreed to assume responsibility for the boy during the summer. The child, Robert Simpson, would become Devereux's first private school student. During that time, Devereux also received similar offers from other parents of children with special needs. In the summer of 1911, Devereux rented at six-bedroom home in Avalon, New Jersey in order to teach and care for eight children.\n\nIn 1912 several children continued to live with Devereux in her own home in Philadelphia, which became her first private school. This marked the beginning of The Devereux Foundation. During that time, Devereux remained a public school teacher, and employed two assistant teachers to teach and look after students during the day.\n\nDevereux devoted herself to learning how to best serve her students. Between the years of 1910 and 1918, Devereux participated in several post graduate endeavors, including the study of psychiatry, psychoanalysis and speech therapy at colleges and universities in the Philadelphia area. She also took apprenticeship training in the areas of occupational therapy, woodworking and handicrafts. All her efforts focused on improving the education and experience of the students in her charge. In 1914 she began working for the Philadelphia Normal School in order to teach post graduate students in the country's first course on special education.\n\nIn 1918, she resigned from the Normal school to teach her private school students full-time. In January 1918 she used $94 of saved and borrowed funds in order to rent a house in Devon, Pennsylvania.\n\nMay 1, 1918 Helena Devereux and her students took residence in the house that became known as “Devereux Stone.” Soon her students numbered 12, and in 1919 Devereux was able to purchase the rental property, as well as the neighboring estate. Over the course of two years, school enrollment doubled. In 1920 Devereux purchased another property in Berwyn, Pennsylvania in order to provide a home to some of the younger developmentally disabled children in her care. From 1920 onward, the organization saw continued growth, both in enrollment numbers, as well as in properties purchased.\n\nIn 1922, the different schools and facilities became united under one name—Devereux Schools. Despite an operating deficit of $250,000 during the Great Depression, Devereux continued to acquire real estate throughout the Philadelphia area. Creditors were kept at bay through the shared burden of Devereux staff, and loans from the parents of Devereux's students.\n\nIn 1938 The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania granted The Devereux Foundation its non-profit charter.\n\nIn 1940 Devereux transferred all the assets and properties of Devereux Schools to the Foundation. In 1943 The Devereux Foundation expanded tremendously, purchasing another building in Devon as well as a 350-acre estate in Santa Barbara, California. She would continue to serve actively as a consultant.\n\nThe Foundation continued to expand in the 1950s and 1960s, opening branches in Texas, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Arizona. In 1955 Devereux began professional training and research partnerships with several universities including the Teachers College of Columbia University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Pennsylvania, and Bryn Mawr College School of Social Work, among others. 1957 saw the introduction of the Devereux Institute for Research and Training, an initiative to expand professional training and research into the causes and treatment of certain psychological problems in children.\n\nIn 1957, Devereux resigned as director of the Foundation.\n\nIn 1958 Devereux became the first non-medical person, and only the fourth woman to become an honorary member of the American Psychiatric Association. Devereux's only published paper was published in 1909 in The Psychological Clinic entitled, “Report of a Year’s Work on Defectives in a Public School.”\n\nIn 1924, Devereux married James Fentress, a widower of one of her friends. She continued to be called Miss Devereux. Married 21 years, they maintained very private personal lives, despite collaborating in the affairs of the organization. A strong supporter of his wife's independence and presence as the President of Devereux, Fentress served as the organization's Vice President, overseeing finances as the organization grew in size and scope.\n\nFentress died in 1943 and Devereux never remarried. Her family life in Pennsylvania centered on her brother, Robert's, children Mary Helena Devereux Scott and Richard Blyton Devereux, M.D.\n\nDevereux died November 17, 1975, at her home in Devon at age 90.\n\n"}

It is located in Region 8. The suburb shares its name with the largest park in the Central Business District, which is located a few blocks from the main train station for the city (known as Park Station in the early years).\n\nJoubert Park is also the location of the Johannesburg Art Gallery.\n\nSixty years ago children played around a fish pond in the middle of Joubert Park. Nearby was a band stand where a military band played every Sunday. Pensioners were sitting on the benches enjoying the sun. There were also many pigeons that were fed by the visitors.\n\nIn the Sixties, a semi-enclosed open air theater was constructed towards the north east corner. Movies were shown on the weekends, and occasionally ballets and plays were performed there. Nearby, a large outdoor chess board, complete with smaller chess tables encircling it, allowed flat(or apartment) dwellers the opportunity to challenge each other.\n\nEvery Easter, an outdoor art exhibition was held. It was called \"Artists under the Sun\".\n\nAround Christmas, a magnificent Disney-like theme park was erected throughout the park highlighting fairytale themes (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs etc.)The trees were lit up with spot lights which enhanced the magical nights. Christmas carols would be piped through overhead speakers to enhance the setting. Families would bring their children to view the spectacular display of coloured lights and statuettes.\n\nThe Victorian conservatory, located at the north west corner, had large green ferns and exotic flowers. It was known as the \"Hothouse\"It also had large pond inside filled with goldfish and magnificent lily pads. It had four main wings and each section was partitioned off by double doors which would swing shut once you had passed through to maintain the different temperatures in each room.. \nIn the North east side of the park was a house that had been built for the use of the children from surrounding suburbs. A daily programme was run by a teacher named Miss Ray who was affectionately known as \"Miss\". After school every day the house would be filled with children who would play outdoor games with the equipment provided. Indoors there would always be paints, crayons cards and puzzles. Every year when the artists of the sun would have their exhibition a category would be opened for young artists under the sun and children who attended the afternoon sessions would be entered by MIss.During the school holidays Miss Ray would take the children on outings to the zoo lake.\n\nOn the south side, overlooking the railway tracks, stands an art museum that was planned in Britain. Consequently, it was built facing south, away from the sun. They had to break down the one side to let the light in. In the Seventies, one of the curators at the museum was named Charles Berry. He was from Cork, Ireland.\n\nDuring the Sixties and Seventies, the park manager was a Mr. Gunn, who lived in a house within the grounds. He was responsible for the upkeep of the park. He was supported by a number of park-keepers, known affectionately as \"Parkies\"\n\nEvery evening, at 6PM, a bell was rung to mark the closing of the park (except over the holiday, when the park remained open until 10PM)\n\nThis is a collection of memories of the park, and unfortunately not all of the part about the museum is entirely true.\n\nJoubert Park today\nWhen thinking of the word 'park' in the context of Johannesburg CBD, Joubert Park instantly jumps to mind due to its richness in narrative and changes and adaptation over time-an important factor to address considering the political regeneration of Johannesburg. Its history is prevalent in the classic elements still actively functioning today, such as the symmetrical layout with arcades resting on the grid of the central axis's that cross at the centre of the park where the fountain (that was once a less prominent pond) is located. \nThe rectangular footprint is masked with a grid that is a continuation of the figure ground of the city along the West and East edges (this promotes infiltration along the broad arcades bordered by trees). Hard and soft landscaping designates activity such as active and passive space. All of the abovementioned elements are reminiscent of an idyllic landscape of a template superimposed on park-scapes worldwide.\nJoubert Park today is an account of Johannesburg as a city in transition. The park is fed by a network of (in-)formal activities, such as the establishment of the chess club, community facilities (aftercare; clinic), a broad field of trade and services all weaved together by the people. The users of the park have designated areas of activity, which is respected by one and all within the park.\n\nJoubert Park has grown alongside the city, with new amenities such as the greenhouse project (previously known as the Victorian Hothouse) on the North-West edge of the site, the big screen Television to the east wing, and the Reya Vaya bus terminal at the outer east edge. \nFurthermore, as the park has become gated in order to control access (as security is undeniably a concern in South Africa), informal traders have manifested themselves along the east and west edges, creating a secondary network of trade arcades. Whilst the ephemeral nature of the park has ensured its longevity, the foliage has remained intact, and confirms the mature nature of this district.\n"}

The group comprises party members under the age of 30.\n\nIn its 1972 Convention, the Socialist Party changed its name to \"Social Democrats, USA\" by a vote of 73 to 34. The change of name was supported by the two Co-Chairmen, Bayard Rustin and Charles S. Zimmerman (of the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union, ILGWU), and by the First National Vice Chairman, James S. Glaser; these three were re-elected by acclamation.\n\nThe Convention elected a national committee of 33 members, with 22 seats for the majority caucus, 8 seats for Harrington's coalition caucus, 2 for the Debs caucus, and one for the \"independent\" Samuel H. Friedman, who also had opposed the name change.\n\nThe convention voted on and adopted proposals for its program by a two-one vote, with the majority caucus winning every vote. A Vice Chairman of the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL), Carl Gershman introduced the international program that was approved. It called for \"firmness toward Communist aggression\". However, on the Vietnam War, the program opposed \"any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission\" and to work for a peace agreement that would protect Communist political cadres in South Vietnam from further military or police reprisals. Harrington's proposal for an immediate cease fire and an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces was defeated. Harrington complained that, after its previous convention, the Socialist Party had endorsed George McGovern with a statement of \"constructive criticism\" and had not mobilized enough support for McGovern.\n\nAfter their defeat at the Convention, some members of the minority caucuses left: at most 200 members of the Coalition Caucus led by Michael Harrington went on to form the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (later becoming the Democratic Socialists of America), some former members of the Debs Caucus led the formation of the \"Socialist Party of the United States of America\".\n\nThe official YPSL continued its existence as the youth section of Social Democrats, USA. The group held a six-day-long \"National School\" in conjunction with its 1974 Convention, held from December 26 to 31 at Malibu, California. A bevy of prominent speakers addressed the gathering, which was coordinated by National Secretary Paul Landsbergis, with lecturers including Sidney Hook, Tom Kahn, SDUSA Executive Director Carl Gershman, professors Seymour Martin Lipset and Robert Scalapino, and representatives of the A. Philip Randolph Institute and the American Federation of Teachers.\n\nIn 1989, the Socialist Party USA relaunched the YPSL as the official youth arm of the Party. In 2010, the YPSL was dissolved and its members were absorbed into the SPUSA.\n\nAt the 2011 National Convention, the resolution to revive the YPSL was passed. As stated in the National Convention Pre-Convention Discussion Bulletin, \"Having a youth affiliation will help the SPUSA tap into the radicalization of youth around the country. Locals around the country are already involved in several campus issues from rising tuition, loan debt, jobs, and many other issues. The SPUSA and YPSL combination will help revitalize the party, and tap into an abundant source of Socialist energy and spirit.\"\n\nHowever, \"It is understood that the SPUSA cannot, and will not form YPSL on own. It will be up [to] those YPSL members themselves to do so. The SPUSA will only help support the re-founding with funds, organizing, and other skills as are available.\"\n\nYPSL's traditional symbol is the \"Three Arrows,\" which has been interpreted differently over the course of the emblem's existence. The arrows are today meant to symbolize the three ways in which humanity works for a better society. They are:\n\n\nAmerican use of the \"Three Arrows\" logo originated in the fall of 1933 with the organization of a uniformed \"Socialist Vanguard\" in New York City, in which about 40 squads of eight members, each squad headed by a \"captain\" were formed. The Vanguard wore distinctive royal blue shirts and bore a new organizational logo, which was described in the official monthly newspaper of the YPSL:\n\"Three arrows enclosed in a circle is the emblem of the Vanguard, borrowed from the now-destroyed Iron Front in Germany. The arrows stand for the slogan of the Young People's Socialist League: 'Organization, education, solidarity.'\"\n\nIn the German context, the \"Three Arrows\" logo was a socialist symbol designed by Sergei Chakhotin, former assistant to the physiologist Ivan Pavlov in 1931. The circular logo was designed so as to be able to easily cover Nazi swastikas.\n\nThe three arrows originally stood for the German socialist movement's opposition to three enemies of democracy: communism, monarchism, and fascism (in Germany: Nazism).\n\n"}

A clock tower at the university campus with a clock face representing each sorority is dedicated to the four.

Kappa Delta also has more than 200 chartered alumnae chapters. It is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nLenora Ashmore Blackiston, Mary Sommerville Sparks Hendrick, Julia Tyler Gardiner Wilson and Sara Turner White founded Kappa Delta at the State Female Normal School (now Longwood University), in Farmville, Virginia.\n\nBlackiston first suggested forming a sorority. She went on to attend Randolph-Macon Woman's College. At 23 years of age in 1897, Hendrick was the oldest founder and stayed at State Normal until 1902, longer than any of the other founders. Wilson was the chief illustrator of the school's yearbook and designed the Kappa Delta badge. White would frequently host Founders Day festivities at her home later in life.\n\nKappa Delta Sorority's official philanthropies are the Girls Scouts of the USA and Prevent Child Abuse America.\n\nKappa Delta's historical philanthropies are the Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU and Orthopaedic Research Awards.\n\nCollegiate and alumnae chapters host confidence-building programs, educational events, campus tours and other activities with Girl Scouts in their communities.

To date, Kappa Delta has donated more than $23 million to prevent child abuse in the USA.\n\nThe official symbols of ΚΔ are the nautilus shell and the dagger, while the mascots are the teddy bear and the katydid. The official colors are olive green and pearl white. The official flower is the white rose. ΚΔ has three official jewels: the diamond, the emerald, and the pearl.\n\nKappa Delta's coat of arms (often called the crest) is a white Norman shield, surmounted by a lamp of ancient design, against a background of ornamental scroll. A ribbon underneath the shield bears the date of the sorority's founding and the Greek Open Motto, \"ta kala diokomen\" which means \"let us strive for that which is honorable, beautiful and highest.\" Kappa Delta's tagline is \"Building Confidence. Inspiring Action.\" \n\n\nKappa Delta has 166 collegiate chapters across North America.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, sorority women from multiple chapters at the University of Alabama – including Kappa Delta, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi, Phi Mu, Pi Beta Phi, Delta Delta Delta, and Chi Omega – alleged that either active members or some alumnae had prevented them from offering membership to black candidates because of their race. Students, including a Kappa Delta member, held a campus march to integrate Greek life on campus, and following media and national outcry, the university held a second round of recruitment in hopes of offering membership to more women. However, Kappa Delta was one of the few chapters on campus who had not recruited a single black woman by the next year.\n\n\n"}

Upon her marriage to fascist propagandist and foreign minister Galeazzo Ciano, she became Edda Ciano, Countess of Cortellazzo and Buccari. Her husband was executed in January 1944 for his role in Mussolini's ouster. She strongly denied her involvement in the National Fascist Party regime and had an affair with a Communist after her father's execution by the Italian partisans in April 1945.\n\nShe was born out of wedlock to Benito Mussolini and Rachele Guidi in Forlì, Romagna. Her parents did not marry until December 1915. In her early years, while her father was editor of \"Il Popolo d'Italia\" in Milan, Edda lived with Rachele in Forlì. Her father became Prime Minister of Italy in October 1922 and Dictator after January 1925.\n\nIn March 1925, Rachele and Edda with her brothers and sisters, moved from Milan to Carpegna and then to Rome in November 1929 to live with their father. Edda was a rebellious woman in her youth. Her powerful father made dating difficult, as most young men feared him. She has been described as being opinionated and outspoken. It was while in Rome that she met Galeazzo Ciano, son of Admiral Count Costanzo Ciano, a loyal Fascist and supporter of Benito Mussolini before his March on Rome. They were married on 24 April 1930 in a lavish ceremony attended by 4,000 guests.\n\nHer husband was appointed Italian Consul in Shanghai, and it was there their first son, Fabrizio Ciano, was born on 1 October 1931. The couple moved back to Italy in 1932, where Galeazzo took the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. By many accounts, theirs was an open marriage, and both had lovers. One of hers was the Chinese general Zhang Xueliang. However, her father liked Galeazzo and so his career prospered.\n\nAfter the Italian invasion of Albania in June 1939, the city of Santi Quaranta (Sarandë in Albanian) was renamed \"Porto Edda\" in her honour during the annexation.\n\nIn July 1939, she was depicted on the front cover of \"Time\" in a feature entitled \"Lady of the Axis\".\n\nDuring the Greco-Italian War, Edda Ciano volunteered for service with the Italian Red Cross. On 14 March 1941, she was embarked near the Albanian port of Valona (now Vlorë) on the Lloyd Triestino liner \"Po\", which had been converted into a hospital ship. British planes attacked and sank the ship, with some loss of life. The ship was moored among other vessels with her lights switched off on the orders of the port authorities and was, therefore, a legitimate target and would not have been easily identifiable as a hospital ship. Edda managed to survive, being picked up from the water by another ship. She continued to work for the Red Cross until 1943.\n\nIt is rumoured that Heinrich Himmler bestowed Edda the rank of an honorary SS leader (\"SS Ehrenführerin\") in 1943, although this is still not known for certain.\n\nAfter Edda's close call in the Adriatic Sea, Rachele and Benito Mussolini were doubly distressed when her brother, Bruno, died in August of the same year.\n\nIn July 1943, when internal opposition against Mussolini finally emerged in the Fascist Grand Council, Galeazzo Ciano voted against his father-in-law. For this act, he was arrested for treason, tried and executed on 11 January 1944.\n\nEdda Ciano escaped to Switzerland on 9 January 1944, disguised as a peasant woman. She managed to smuggle out the Count's wartime diaries, which had been hidden in her clothing by her confidant Emilio Pucci. At that time he was a lieutenant in the Italian Air Force but later found fame as a fashion designer. War correspondent Paul Ghali of the \"Chicago Daily News\" learned of her secret internment in a Swiss convent in Neggio and arranged the publication of the diaries. They reveal much of the secret history of the Fascist regime between 1939 and 1943 and are considered a prime historical source. The diaries are strictly political and contain little of the Cianos' personal lives.\n\nAfter returning to Italy from Switzerland, Edda was arrested and held in detention on the island of Lipari. On 20 December 1945, she was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for aiding Fascism.\nAn Italian film is dedicated to the residence of Edda in Lipari and her relationship with a young communist of the place.\n\nHer autobiography, \"La mia vita\", was published in translation as \"My Truth\" by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in 1975.\n\nShe died in Rome in 1995.\n\nIt was widely reported at the time that the daughter of Hermann Göring and Emmy Göring (born 2 June 1938) was named Edda Göring after her.\n\nA number of films have been made about Edda's life, including \"Mussolini and I\" (1985) in which she was played by Susan Sarandon.\n\nHer son Fabrizio Ciano wrote a personal memoir entitled \"Quando il nonno fece fucilare papà\" (\"When Grandpa had Daddy Shot\").\n\n\n\n"}

The route parallels its predecessor, local Trunk 3. The highway varies from 2-lane controlled access to 2-lane local secondary roads on the section between Yarmouth and Hebbville. East of Hebbville to Upper Tantallon, the highway is 2-lane controlled access, with the exception of a 4-lane divided freeway near Chester. From Upper Tantallon (Exit 5), to the interchange with Highway 102 (near Bayers Lake) in Halifax, the highway is 4-lane divided freeway. Similar to Highway 101, kilometer markers increase run west-to-east, increasing from Yarmouth to Halifax; however, exit numbers run east-to-west, increasing from Halifax to Yarmouth.\n\nIn 2013, Highway 103 was redesignated as the Fishermen's Memorial Highway.\n\nThe highway has developed sporadically since the 1970s, with the 2-lane controlled access portion to Bridgewater being largely responsible for the abandonment of CN Rail's South Shore line, the former Halifax and Southwestern Railway. In November 2006, construction was completed that twinned 15 kilometers of highway between Exit 3 and Exit 5. In December 2006, an 8.3 kilometre bypass around Barrington was completed.\n\nIn late September 2015 a new section of highway was opened to bypass the Port Joli area.

Construction is expected to be completed by Fall 2020. Twinning from Exit 5A (Ingramport) to Exit 6 (Hubbards) will start in 2020 with an expected completion date of 2023.\n\n\nBetween 2006 and 2009, there were 29 deaths on the highway. In 2009, it was considered Nova Scotia's deadliest highway and was ranked the second most dangerous highway in Canada by the Canadian Automobile Association. In 2009 alone, ten people died in automobile accidents on the highway, according to the Nova Scotia Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. Between 2008 and 2012, there were 22 fatalities on the highway.\n\nIn September 2018, local residents raised concern over the presence of a road sign on the highway, near the turnoff to Port Mouton, that had a very confusing appearance, looking like a patchwork of several other road signs. It was supposedly revealed when a hotel removed its billboard advertisement, revealing the sign below.\n\n"}

This type of exchange is the foundation of a bartering economy. Double coincidence of wants means that both of the parties have to agree to sell and buy each commodity. Under this system, problems arise through the improbability of the wants, needs, or events that cause or motivate a transaction occurring at the same time and the same place. One example is the bar musician who is \"paid\" with liquor or food, items which his landlord will not accept as rent payment, when the musician would rather have a month's shelter. If, instead, the musician's landlord were to throw a party and desire music for it, hiring the musician to play it by offering the month's rent in exchange, a coincidence of wants would exist.\n\nIn-kind transactions have several limitations, most notably timing constraints. If you wish to trade fruit for wheat, you can only do this when the fruit and wheat are both available at the same time and place (and, additionally, only if someone wishes to trade wheat for fruit). That may be a very brief time, or it may be never. With a medium of exchange you can sell your fruit when it is ripe and take the medium of exchange; then use that to buy wheat when it is harvested, without the need for a coincidence of wants. \n\nBesides barter, other kinds of in-kind transactions also suffer from the coincidence of wants problem in the absence of a medium of exchange. Romance, for example often relies on a double coincidence of wants. If Max likes Mallory but Mallory does not like Max, then the two cannot meaningfully exchange the benefits of romance. If this coincidence of wants occurs, though, a mutually beneficial relationship is established. \n\nAs another example, when wealth is transferred during marriage, divorce, inheritance, and other crucial life events, or during the collection of taxes or tribute, it is improbable that this event will coincide with the recipient's desire for the commodities the payer can readily obtain. All of these transactions require an improbable coincidence of wants and events.\n\nWilliam Stanley Jevons and Ross M. Starr use the term 'double coincidence of wants' for the same concept.\n\n\n"}

Hon. Richard Hare, 4th Earl of Listowel, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, and The Hon. Freda Vanden-Bampde-Johnstone. His elder brother, The 5th Earl of Listowel, was a prominent Labour politician. He was educated at Eton.\n\nBlakenham was an Alderman of London County Council between 1937 and 1952 and fought in the Second World War with the Suffolk Yeomanry in Italy and was awarded the Legion of Honour and appointed an OBE. He sat as Member of Parliament for Woodbridge between 1945 and 1950 and for Sudbury and Woodbridge between 1950 and 1963 and was vice-chairman of the Conservative Party between 1952 and 1955. He served under Sir Anthony Eden as Minister of State for the Colonies between 1955 and 1956 and under Eden and his successor, Harold Macmillan, as Secretary of State for War from 1956 to 1958.\n\nHe later held office under Macmillan as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 1958 to 1960 and Minister of Labour between 1960 and 1963. He was admitted to the Privy Council in 1955 and in 1963 he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Blakenham, of Little Blakenham in the County of Suffolk.

He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder between and , most notably as a member of the New York Yankees dynasty that won five consecutive World Series championships between 1949 to 1953.\n\nWoodling was a left-handed batter known as a line drive hitter who hit over .300 five times during his seventeen-year career and, had a .318 batting average during his five World Series appearances. He excelled defensively, leading American League outfielders in fielding or tied for the lead four times, and never made more than three errors in a season during his tenure with the Yankees. \n\nWoodling also played for the Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates, Baltimore Orioles, Washington Senators, and the New York Mets in their expansion year of 1962. His baseball career was interrupted by his military service in the United States Navy during the Second World War. After his playing career, he served several major league teams as a coach and a scout.\n\nWoodling was born in Akron, Ohio where his father worked in a rubber factory. His professional baseball career began in 1940 in the Indians' organization. He missed the 1944 and 1945 seasons while serving in the United States Navy in the Pacific. Before coming to the majors for good in 1949, Woodling was a four-time minor league batting average champion. He mostly played left field (1,208 games) when he entered the majors, but appeared in 325 contests in right field and played 93 games in center.\n\nWoodling played with many teams during his career, the longest term of service being with the Yankees for six years and 698 of the 1,763 games played of his MLB career. With them, Woodling had what was probably his best year, 1953. Although he only had 395 at bats, he led the American League with a .429 on-base percentage.\n\nWhile Woodling was with the Yankees, the team won five consecutive World Series (1949–53). During that time, Yankee manager Casey Stengel praised the outfielder's ability to run and throw. Stengel generally platooned him with right-hander Hank Bauer, but each averaged 400 at bats per season. Woodling hit a solo home run in each World Series from 1951 through 1953, and, in 1951, helped Allie Reynolds secure his first of two no-hitters on the season, when he homered in a 1–0 win over Bob Feller and the Indians. In 1952, Woodling became the first player to pinch-hit a triple in the World Series.\n\nOn November 17, 1954, a record seventeen-player deal took place between the Orioles and Yankees, involving Woodling, future twenty-game winner Bob Turley and Don Larsen, who would go on to pitch a perfect game in the 1956 World Series for New York. Woodling had been sidelined for the last part of the 1954 season with a broken arm.\n\nSoon, Woodling moved to the Indians where he set career-highs in home runs (19), runs batted in (78), and batting (.321) in 1957. A few months before he turned forty, he was sent to the New York Mets, where old Yankees manager Casey Stengel was working on his latest project, the newborn Mets. Woodling would be managed by Stengel for the remainder of the 1962 season. He was released before the 1963 season, after publicly criticizing the front office's contract negotiations with Marv Throneberry.\n\nIn a seventeen-season career, Woodling batted .284 with 147 home runs and 830 RBI in 1,796 games. Woodling ended with a .386 on-base percentage and 1,585 career hits in 5,587 at bats. He hit .300 or better five times. In five World Series, Woodling hit .318 (27-85). As an outfielder, he recorded a .989 fielding percentage.\n\nWoodling was appointed on November 20, 1963 as the Orioles' first-base coach by former Yankees teammate Hank Bauer, who had become the team's manager one day earlier. He remained in that capacity through the 1966 World Series Championship season and up until the announcement on September 28, 1967 that he would not be retained for the 1968 season. He was also a scout for the Yankees and the Indians.\n\nWoodling died at the age of 78 in a nursing home in Wadsworth, Ohio on June 2, 2001.\n\n"}

They are native to Europe, the Mediterranean, northwestern Africa, and western Asia.\n\nThe European spadefoot toads are small- to large-sized frogs, up to in length, which are often inconspicuously coloured. They are predominantly fossorial (burrowing) frogs, which burrow in sandy soils. They have hardened protrusions on their feet to aid in digging, which is the source of the common name. They emerge from the ground during periods of rain and breed in pools, which are usually temporary.\n\nAll of the species from this family have free-living, aquatic tadpoles. The eggs are laid in temporary ponds that may quickly evaporate, so the tadpole stage is unusually brief, with rapid development to the adult form in as little as two weeks. To further speed their growth, some of the tadpoles are cannibalistic, eating their brood-mates to increase their supply of protein.\n\nThe seven species of American spadefoot toads (genera \"Scaphiopus\" and \"Spea\") were previously also included in the family Pelobatidae, but are now generally regarded as the separate family Scaphiopodidae.\n\nFamily Pelobatidae\n\nThe earliest fossil genus of pelobatids, \"Elkobatrachus\", was described in 2006.\n\nIn the Jurassic Morrison Formation, pelobatids are represented by the illium of an unnamed but indeterminate species. This illium is larger than that of \"Enneabatrachus\", a contemporary discoglossid species. A specimen has been recovered from Quarry 9 of Como Bluff in Wyoming. Pelobatids are present in stratigraphic zones 5 and 6 of the formation.\n\n"}
{"id": "2256308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2256308", "title": "Songpyeon", "text": "Songpyeon\n\nSongpyeon (, 松餠) is a traditional Korean food made of rice powder. It is a type of \"tteok\", small rice cakes, traditionally eaten during the Korean autumn harvest festival, Chuseok. It is a popular symbol of traditional Korean culture. The earliest records of songpyeon date from the Goryeo period.\n\nSongpyeons are half-moon shaped rice cakes that typically contain sweet or semi-sweet fillings, such as soybeans, cowpeas, chestnuts, jujubes, dates, red beans, sesame seeds, or honey. They are steamed over a layer of pine needles, which gives them a distinctive taste and the fragrant smell of fresh pine trees. The name Songpyeon comes from the use of pine needles—\"song\" means pine tree, thus, songpyeon translates to “pine cakes.”\n\nSongpyeon is quintessential to Korean families' Chuseok celebrations. Traditionally, songpyeon was made by Korean families using freshly harvested rice and then offered to their ancestors on the morning of Chuseok as thanks for the bountiful harvest during charye (차례, 茶禮), an ancestral memorial ritual. Songpyeon is also given to other family members and close neighbors. Such offerings are viewed as signs of respect and efforts to avoid bad luck within the family.\n\nSongpyeon is used to show gratitude for the year's harvest by placing it on a table with other foods, included newly harvested fruit, and taro. These three foods symbolize, respectively, the fruit of the heavens, the fruit of the earth, and the fruit of the underground.\n\nSongpyeon is also said to represent the moon and wishes, which is why people will say their wishes while making and eating it. Many stories describe why songpyeon is in the shape of a half moon rather than a full moon. The most common belief is that Korean ancestors thought that a round-shaped full moon could only wane while a half-moon would fill up. This is considered a sign of abundance and prosperity.\n\nAn old Korean anecdote says that the person who makes beautifully-shaped songpyeon will meet a good spouse or give birth to a beautiful baby.\n\nSongpyeon is made by kneading rice flour with salt and hot water until it is smooth in order to create a dough. Small pieces of the dough are torn off, rolled into balls and then indented in the center using a thumb. The filling of choice is placed inside the now hollowed center and then the ball is sealed closed and shaped. The rice cakes are steamed on top of pine needles for about 20-30 minutes and then rinsed with cold water in order to maintain their chewy texture. The rice cakes are then blotted dry and typically finished by being brushed with sesame oil.\n\nSteaming the rice cakes on top of pine needles doesn’t only give them a unique taste and scent, but helps to prevent the rice cakes from sticking together while steaming and from spoiling due to the presence of terpene. Pine trees also produce large amounts of phytoncide, which effectively kills germs.\n\nAccording to the Dongui Bogam (동의 보감, 東醫寶鑑), the most well-known Joseon medical book, the pine needles are also said to have medicinal effects on the food.\n\nAlthough the cultural significance of songpyeon remains the same, differences in color, shape, ingredients, and even thickness can be found across Korea.\n\nAs pumpkin is widely grown in this region, Chungcheong Province is known for its pumpkin songpyeon. The pumpkins are dried and ground into a powder which is then mixed with the rice flour to make the dough. The rice cakes are often shaped to look like small pumpkins. The result is a sweet rice cake that is bright in color.\n\nWith an abundance of potato crops and oak trees, Gangwon Province is known for its potato songpyeon and acorn songpyeon. These rice cakes are made with potato starch and acorn powder, respectively. The songpyeon in this region are typically flat with ridges from pressing down using fingers and in Gangneung, people leave their handprints on the rice cakes.\n\nSongpyeon made in Gyeongsang Province are typically larger than the songpyeon found in other regions. A popular type of songpyeon found here is ramie songpyeon, which consists of boiled ramie leaves which are added to the rice cakes to make them healthier.\n\nA traditional filling for songpyeon made on Jeju Island is sweetened peas. The songpyeon are sometimes shaped with a concave center to resemble a volcanic crater and are often pan-fried after being steamed.\n\nSongpyeon made in Jeolla Province sometimes contains arrowroot starch which is combined with rice flour to make the rice cake dough. Jeolla Province is also known for its flower songpyeon which are made with natural dyes and made to resemble flowers either by hand or by using a mold.\n\nSeoul is known for its small, five-colored or \"osaek\" songpyeon (오색송편). The five colors—white, brown, pink, green, and yellow—represent the harmony of nature. White songpyeon lacks any color additives, but the other colors are obtained using natural ingredients. Brown is created using cinnamon; pink, by using strawberry or \"omija\" syrup; green, by using mugwort; and yellow, by using gardenia seeds.\n\nThe traditional songpyeon made in Pyeongan Province in North Korea is seashell songpyeon. The name of this songpyeon is attributed to its seashell shape. Its filling consists of sesame seeds, sugar, and soy sauce.\n\n\n"}
