{"id": "2077275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077275", "title": "Toliara", "text": "Toliara\n\nToliara (also known as \"Toliary\", ; formerly \"Tuléar\") is a city in Madagascar.\n\nIt is the capital of the Atsimo-Andrefana region, located 936 km southwest of national capital Antananarivo.\n\nThe current spelling of the name was adopted in the 1970s, reflecting the orthography of the Malagasy language. Many geographic place names, assigned French spellings during the colonial period, were altered following Malagasy independence in 1960.\n\nThe city has a population of 156,710 in 2013. As a port town it acts as a major import/export hub for commodities such as sisal, soap, hemp, cotton, rice and peanuts.\n\nIn the 17th century, French buccaneers landed in the bay of St. Augustine near the Tropic of Capricorn, and founded the city to maintain commercial relations. \nIt was not until the colonial period, after 1897, when the city really grew: with the efforts of Joseph Gallieni to install French administrative services, previously isolated on the island of Nosy Ve, to form the regional capital. Tulear grew along a grid pattern of cross streets, with wide avenues and public monuments.\n\nToliara has seen a population boom over the last two decades, due to a rural exodus that has brought over 200,000 citizens into urban centers in the region.\n\nThe Vezo, nomadic fishermen, are the indigenous ethnic group. Today they are being dominated by migrants from the South (Mahafale, Masikoro, Antandroy) which make up more than half of the urban population. To these are added migrants from other urban regions, occupying positions in government and the private sector.\n\nToliara's cathedral is the archiepiscopal seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toliara, one of five in the country, originally the Diocese of Tuléar since 1957, renamed with the city in 1989, promoted in 2003 to Metropolitan archbishopric.\n\nRegional cultural highlights include:\n\nThe University of Toliara is historically the oldest center for higher education, founded in 1971 after the decentralization of the University of Madagascar center. The university campus is located in Maninday 5 km east of the city, and teaches Humanities and Social Science, Science, Philosophy, and Management (the latter located next to the Cedratom). The University of Toliara's Faculty for Teacher Training (ENS) and Institute of Agriculture and Hydrology (IST) is currently working with the NGO Big Red Earth to explore educational innovations in the areas of agriculture, civic engagement, and sustainable development.\n\nThe Fisheries and Marine Sciences Institute (IHSM) welcomes students from diverse backgrounds, and offers advanced training in fisheries, aquaculture, and the marine and coastal environment. In 2000 it set up the National Oceanographic Data Centre. A regional centre for distance education (CRTE) of the Centre National de Télé-Enseignement de Madagascar (CNETMAD) is located in Toliara. \n\nToliara has a Technical School and two grammar schools (Lycée Laurent Botokeky and Antaninarenina High School), private and religious schools such as Sacred Heart College, Tsianaloke Mahavatse, and the School of Notre Dame, and a French international school, Collège Etienne de Flacourt, which serves \"école primaire\" (primary school) and \"collège\" (lower secondary school or junior high school).\n\n\nThe port played a key role during the \"boom corn\" years in the 1980s and 90s. Today, the arrival of migrants contributing to agricultural production (maize, cassava and rice) and livestock (cattle and goats) supplying the city markets with food, has contributed to the development of small informal businesses: particularly among the Mahafale and Masikoro communities. The city specializes in the import and export of various products including sisal, cotton, rice, peanuts and soap. Production of sea salt thrives, from salt marshes and landscaped places in coastal areas.\n\nThe Bay of Toliara houses one of Madagascar's oil exploration sites.\nThe sea floor is rich in minerals gemstones (about 200 km to the north lies the Ilakaka sapphire deposit has operated since 1999) and ground salt. \nMore recently, Canadian companies begin operation of the ilmenite in the region of Tolanaro.\nBeyond this mining and production, the industrial sector has declined in recent decades,\n\nTourism is a promising sector, thanks to the climate and natural assets of the hinterland (Ifaty Anakao, St Augustine). Calm shallow seas and shallow support scuba diving, and Toliara remains a main destination for tours to southern Madagascar.\n\nToliara is located on a broad coastal plain, surrounded by dunes and mangroves, near the Tropic of Capricorn in the Mozambique Channel. A nearby barrier reef (the Great Reef) is 18 km long and 3 km wide. The beach area is extended by an underwater beach along the continental shelf that slopes gently seaward. To the north lies the Delta Fiherenana.\n\nToliara is nicknamed the \"City of the Sun\" because it has a hot climate (24.3 °C average) and is semi-arid (Köppen \"BSh\"), with less than 400 mm annual rainfall. The city is constantly swept by a strong prevailing wind, the Tsio Katimo (\"South Wind\"). \n\nThe colonial legacy is still visible in the architecture and the urban landscape. Major road works and development were undertaken in 2003 to promote the development of the city.\n\nThe University Hospital Centre is located near the city center in the district of Tanambao. Another private health facility, St. Luke's Clinic, is located in the district of Sanfily on the road to the airport.\n\nThere is an airport.\nAir Madagascar operates scheduled flights to here.\n\nThere is a French international school, Collège Étienne-de-Flacourt.\n\n\n"}

Purism was led by Amédée Ozenfant and Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier). Ozenfant and Le Corbusier formulated an aesthetic doctrine born from a criticism of Cubism and called it Purism: where objects are represented as elementary forms devoid of detail. The main concepts were presented in their short essay \"Après le Cubisme\" (After Cubism) published in 1918.\n\nLe Corbusier and Ozenfant were the creators of Purism. Fernand Léger was a principle associate. Purism was an attempt to restore regularity in a war-torn France post World War I. Unlike what they saw as 'decorative' fragmentation of objects in Cubism, Purism proposed a style of painting where elements were represented as robust simplified forms with minimal detail, while embracing technology and the machine.\n\nPurism culminated in Le Corbusier’s \"Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau\" (Pavilion of the New Spirit), constructed for the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in 1925. This included the work of Cubists Juan Gris and Jacques Lipchitz. Following this exhibition the relationship between Le Corbusier and Ozenfant declined.\n\nOzenfant and Le Corbusier contributed extensively to an art magazine called \"L'Esprit Nouveau\" from 1920 to 1925 serving as a platform for propaganda towards their Purist movement.\n\nThe Purist Manifesto lays out the rules Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created to govern the Purist movement.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1989, after the collapse of the communist regime, the State Central Library was once again renamed to Biblioteca Națională a României.\n\nIn 1986, a new, larger location began to be built for the library, between Piața Unirii and Nerva Traian. The initial lead architect was Cezar Lăzărescu, who died in 1986 before the building was finished. Shortly after 1989, although some parts of the building were finished or in an advanced state, due to lack of funding, the construction had stalled for several years. In 2009 the project was reassigned to the Ministry of Culture, which completed the construction in 2011 and set the official opening date to take place in 2012.\n\nThe National Library is a cultural institution under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture.

Although U-boats were few in number and not yet capable of posing a major threat in open ocean where ships were difficult to locate, they could be a threat near ports, bays or channels where ships would be certain to be grouped together. Aircraft had proven themselves in similar defensive situations such as convoys, where aircraft forced submarines to remain submerged. The United States already had aircraft and bases to defend its own shores, but it was concluded that additional stations in Canada would be needed.\n\nThe United States supplied aircraft and personnel while Canada recruited and trained its own aircrew and support personnel who were intended to replace the Americans. RCNAS aircrew were trained in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe United States Naval Flying Corps flew convoy escort missions and reconnaissance patrols from two air stations which were established in Nova Scotia near convoy assembly ports:\n\n\nEscorts were provided to ships leaving and entering port. No U-boats were ever located, however, although 110,000 tons of shipping were sunk in North American waters in the last two months of the war.\n\nThe war ended before the RCNAS aircrew had completed training and the RCNAS was disbanded. The Air Board took control of both stations. The Halifax station would remain in operation, while the North Sydney station was left inactive until the Second World War.\n\nAfter the disbanding of the RCNAS, the RCN would not operate naval aircraft until World War II when they manned escort carriers and . Several Canadian Naval Air Service Pilots were loaned to the Royal Navy and few from British aircraft carriers. Lieutenant Robert Hampton Gray was awarded the Victoria Cross for his action when he died just five days before the war ended. In 1975 the RCN ended their naval aviation role when the RCAF took over.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2077306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077306", "title": "Total Devo", "text": "Total Devo\n\nTotal Devo is the seventh studio album by the American new wave band Devo. Their first album for Enigma Records, it was originally released in May 1988, four years after their previous album, \"Shout\". The album was recorded between 1986 and 1988, with the basic tracks recorded at Devo studios, in Marina del Rey, and the additional tracks at Master Control, in Burbank, California.\n\n\"Total Devo\" was the first Devo studio album released after the departure of drummer Alan Myers, who was replaced by former Sparks and Gleaming Spires drummer David Kendrick. This was the last Devo album to include use of the Fairlight CMI digital sampling synthesizer, which was mostly used for pre-sequencing the album and sampling in the choruses of \"Some Things Never Change\" and \"Agitated.\"\n\n\"Total Devo\" was the only Devo album to be released on DAT in addition to the standard releases on vinyl, cassette and CD. At 41 minutes and 30 seconds long, it is also Devo's longest studio album.\n\nDespite initial negative reception of the album, \"Disco Dancer\" hit #45 on \"Billboard\"'s Hot Dance/Club Play chart for the week of September 3, 1988.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Devo's official Facebook page announced that Futurismo Inc. would be issuing a 30th anniversary two-disc deluxe edition of \"Total Devo\", on both CD and vinyl formats. The double CD set comes housed in a digipak while the double LP comes in three vinyl color variations. Both formats include gatefold sleeves with spot gloss logos and shapes, a fold-out poster and liner notes from band member Gerald Casale.\n\n\"Baby Doll\" was used that same year in the comedy film \"Tapeheads\", with newly recorded Swedish lyrics, and was credited to (and shown in a music video by) a fictitious Swedish band called Cube-Squared.\n\n\"Some Things Never Change\" contains a portion of lyrics from an earlier composition entitled \"Some Things Don't Change,\" which was a reject from their previous album, \"Shout\", and later appeared on the compilation album \"Recombo DNA\" in 2000. The song also paraphrases a lyric from the Beatles' \"A Day in the Life\" and appeared in Interplay's computer adventure game, \"Neuromancer\", itself an adaptation of the 1984 novel of the same name by William Gibson.\n\n\"The Shadow\" has lyrics that contain numerous references to literary works. The chorus is partially lifted from T. S. Eliot's poem \"The Hollow Men\" and it incorporates and paraphrases the catchphrase from the serials following the character The Shadow (\"Who knows what lurks in the hearts of men?/The shadow knows!\").\n\nThe cover photograph is based on an early promotional photo by Devo from 1977. However, in taking the cover shot, David Kendrick's chin fell behind Bob Casale's uniform. Rather than retake the photo, a second photo of Kendrick's chin was very obviously pasted on. For the silhouette photo on the back cover, the band members posed naked, in a spoof of Prince's \"Lovesexy\" album art.\n\nThe caption on the front cover has changed depending on the number of tracks contained on each release. The cover of the original vinyl release included the caption \"11 digital cartoons from the de-evolution band,\" while the original CD release, which included two additional tracks, was captioned \"13 digital cartoons from the de-evolution band.\" A cassette release was captioned \"12 digital cartoons...\" and the Restless Records re-release is captioned with \"16 digital cartoons...\". The 2018 Futurismo release simply says \"Digital cartoons...\".\n\nA music video was made for the album's second single, \"Disco Dancer,\" using a slightly remixed version of the track by producer Ivan Ivan. According to Devo co-songwriter and bass guitarist Gerald Casale, the video failed to receive airplay after first being aired on MTV's \"Smash or Trash?,\" in which a video was aired and viewers would call in and vote on it. The video was \"trashed\" and MTV refused to air it after that.\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus, the \"Total Devo\" tour saw the band scaling things back considerably. The sets were very basic with no complex visuals and the band wore plain red shirts and pants, with the computer generated image of a smiling and frowning face (as featured on the artwork of the album) on the back of the shirts. These outfits were augmented by Energy domes as well as the \"World Service\" uniforms introduced at the time of release during certain parts of the show. The tour was commemorated on the 1989 album \"\".\n\nOn later dates in the tour, two songs from their next album \"Smooth Noodle Maps\" were added to the setlist: \"Post Post-Modern Man\" and \"A Change Is Gonna Cum\".\nFirst Leg (1988–1989)\n\n1. \"Jocko Homo\"<br>2. \"It Doesn't Matter to Me\"<br>3. \"Going Under\"<br>4. \"Working in the Coal Mine\"<br>5. \"Happy Guy\"<br>6. \"That's Good\"<br>7. \"Jerkin' Back 'N' Forth\"<br>8. \"Pity You\"<br>9. \"Girl U Want\"<br>10. \"Whip It\"<br>11. \"Baby Doll\"<br>12. \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"<br>13. \"Uncontrollable Urge\"<br>14. \"Gut Feeling\"<br>15. \"Gates of Steel\" / \"Slap Your Mammy\" \n\nEncore<br>16. \"Beautiful World\"\n\nSecond Encore<br>17. \"Shout\"\n\n18. \"Somewhere\"\n\n19. \"Disco Dancer\"\n\nPost Show Party\n\n20. \"Fraulein\"\n\n21. \"I've Been Refused\"\n\n22. \"I Need A Chick\"\n\nSecond Leg (1989–1990)\n\n\nLike its predecessor, \"Shout\", \"Total Devo\" received largely negative reviews, with some critics (including band members) pointing out the band's own \"de-evolution\" in quality compared to their earlier material. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau awarded the album a C+ grade, noting its \"retro-electro sheen\". Michael Azerrad of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine awarded the album one star out of five, dismissing it as \"a desperate SOS from main writer Mark Mothersbaugh,\" adding that, \"If you listen closely, the bass drum on this record sounds suspiciously like a digital sampling of the sound of a dead horse being beaten.\"\n\nIn retrospective reviews, Steve Huey of AllMusic said \"Total Devo\" found the band to be \"no longer innovative and not incredibly compelling.\" Similarly, Mark Prindle of Prindle Record Reviews said that, while \"Total Devo\" was a stronger effort than its predecessor, the album was \"just midtempo, middle-of-the-road pop music, fit only for orthodontist's offices and homecoming dances.\"\n\nAll lead vocals performed by Mark Mothersbaugh, except where noted.\n\n<br>\n1994 Restless Records CD reissue bonus tracks\n\n<br>\n2018 Futurismo Inc. \"Deluxe Edition\" CD bonus disc\n\nTracks 9–14 previously unreleased.\n\n"}
{"id": "2077307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077307", "title": "Astyages", "text": "Astyages\n\nAstyages (spelled by Herodotus as \"Astyages\"; by Ctesias as \"Astyigas\"; by Diodorus as \"Aspadas\"; Babylonian: \"Ištumegu\") was the last king of the Median Empire, r. 585–550 BCE, the son of Cyaxares; he was dethroned in 550 BCE by Cyrus the Great. His name derives from the Old Iranian \"Rishti Vaiga\", which means \"swinging the spear, lance-hurler.\" In the inscriptions of Nabonidus, the name is written \"Ishtuvegu\".\n\nAstyages succeeded his father in 585 BCE, following the Battle of Halys, which ended a five-year war between the Lydians and the Medes. He inherited a large empire, ruled in alliance with his two brothers-in-law, Croesus of Lydia and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whose wife, Amytis, Astyages' sister, was the queen for whom Nebuchadnezzar was said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. However, due to recent evidence, the garden was likely built by the Assyrian King Sennacherib. Married to Aryenis, the sister of King Croesus of Lydia, to seal the treaty between the two empires, Astyages ascended to the Median throne upon his father's death later that year.\n\nThe ancient sources report almost nothing about Astyages’ reign, and a final judgment on his character is not possible, since Herodotus’ negative account (Astyages is represented as a cruel and despotic ruler) and Ctesias’ favorable one, are both biased. According to \"Cyropaedia\" of Xenophon, after thirty-two years of relative stability, Astyages lost the support of his nobles during the war against Cyrus, whom Xenophon understands as being Astyages' grandson. This resulted in the founding of the Persian empire by Cyrus.\n\nThe account given by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus relates that Astyages had a dream in which his daughter, Mandane, gave birth to a son who would destroy his empire. Fearful of the dream's prophecy, Astyages married her off to Cambyses I of Anšan, who had a reputation for being a \"quiet and thoughtful prince\" and whom Astyages believed to be no threat.\n\nWhen a second dream warned Astyages of the dangers of Mandane's offspring, Astyages sent his general Harpagus to kill the child Cyrus. Herodotus correctly names Cyrus' parents, though he fails to mention that Cambyses was a king. Modern scholarship generally rejects his claim that Cyrus was the grandson of Astyages. Harpagus, unwilling to spill royal blood, gave the infant to a shepherd, Mitridates, whose wife had just given birth to a stillborn child.\n\nCyrus was raised as Mitridates' own son, and Harpagus presented the stillborn child to Astyages as the dead Cyrus. When Cyrus was found alive at age ten, Astyages spared the boy on the advice of his Magi, returning him to his parents in Anshan. Harpagus, however, did not escape punishment, as Astyages is said to have fed him his own son at a banquet. Cyrus succeeded his father in 559, and in 553, on the advice of Harpagus, who was eager for revenge for being given the \"abominable supper,\" Cyrus rebelled against Astyages. After three years of fighting, Astyages' troops mutinied during the battle of Pasargadae, and Cyrus conquered the Median's empire. Astyages was spared by Cyrus, and despite being taunted by Harpagus, Herodotus says he was treated well and remained in Cyrus' court until his death. Rather than giving the popular mythology that Cyrus was suckled by a dog, the dog was sacred to Persians. cf. also the legend of Sargon, or the similar legend of Romulus and Remus, suckled by a she-wolf. () Herodotus explains that the herdsman Mitridates lived with another of Astyages' slaves, a woman named 'Spaco,' which he explains is Median for \"dog.\" gives both the legend and Herodotus' rationalized version.\n\nThe contemporary \"Chronicle of Nabonidus\" refers to the mutiny on the battlefield as the cause for Astyages' overthrow, but does not mention Harpagus by name. However, since Harpagus was Astyages' general at the battle of Pasargadae and his family were granted high positions in Cyrus' empire after the war, and since Harpagus went on to become Cyrus' most successful general, it is possible he had something to do with the mutiny against Astyages. Cyrus then went on to capture Astyages' capital of Ecbatana. Ancient sources agree that after Astyages was taken by Cyrus he was treated with clemency, though the accounts differ. Herodotus says that Cyrus kept Astyages at his court during the remainder of his life, while according to Ctesias, he was made a governor of a region of Parthia and was later murdered by a political opponent, Oebares. The circumstances of Astyages' death are not known. After Astyages' overthrow, Croesus marched on Cyrus to avenge Astyages. Cyrus, with Harpagus at his side, defeated Croesus and conquered Lydia in or after 547 BCE.\n\n"}

She also starred in the 1932 film \"Santa,\" one of the first Mexican sound films, and one of the first commercial Spanish-language sound films.\n\nTovar was born in Matías Romero, Oaxaca, Mexico, the daughter of Egidio Tovar, who was from Tehuacán, Puebla, Mexico, and Mary Tovar (née Sullivan), who was Irish-Mexican, from Matías Romero, Oaxaca, Mexico. Tovar was the oldest of nine children, though many of her siblings did not survive early childhood. Tovar grew up during the time of the Mexican Revolution and her family was very poor. She was raised in a very religious Catholic environment, and went to a school where she was taught by nuns.\n\nIn 1918, Tovar's family moved north to Mexico City where her father worked for the National Railroad of Mexico in an administrative position.\n\nTovar was discovered by documentary filmmaker Robert Flaherty in Mexico City. Tovar had performed in a dance class and was invited, along with other girls, to do a screen test as part of a competition. Tovar won first place. The prize was a 6-month probation period, followed by a 7-year contract at $150/week, to Fox Studios. The studio had realized they could make money by simultaneously shooting Spanish-language movies of English language studio productions, so had been casting for Spanish stars. She moved to Hollywood in November 1928 with her maternal grandmother, Lucy Sullivan.\n\nTovar, under contract, was required to study intensively to enhance her skills for films. Her weekly schedule included guitar, two hours four days; Spanish dances, one hour three days; dramatics, one-half hour two days; and English, one hour every day. Her accent was considered an asset in talking motion pictures. Her English improved significantly in just seven months from the time she arrived in Hollywood in January 1929, when she could not say \"good morning\" in English. To improve her English, she attended talkies; she also learned new words and how to say them by reading voraciously. In 1929, Tovar appeared in the films \"The Veiled Woman\" with Bela Lugosi (now thought to be a lost film) and \"The Cock-Eyed World\".\n\nIn 1930, she was mentioned for leads in two talkies starring Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Richard Barthelmess. Fairbanks put off the filming of what became \"The Exile\". After his death, the film was made in 1947 by his son, Douglas, Jr., directed by Max Ophüls.\n\nLupita's future husband, producer Paul Kohner, convinced Carl Laemmle to make Spanish language movies that could be shot simultaneously at night with their English originals. When sound films began to dominate the industry, casting director Jimmy Ryan warned her that her poor English would not work and her option would not be picked up. However, he recommended pursuing work in the foreign film department. She went to the office and sat around all day without being seen; she left early because a man kept staring at her and made her feel uncomfortable. When she returned to the office another day she met the head of the department, Kohner, who was the man who kept staring at her before. He offered her a job making $15 a day to dubbing films in Spanish, her first being \"The King of Jazz\".\n\nIn 1930, Tovar starred opposite Antonio Moreno in \"La Voluntad del Muerto\", the Spanish-language version of \"The Cat Creeps\" and was based on the John Willard mystery play, \"The Cat and the Canary.\" Both \"The Cat Creeps\" and \"La Voluntad del muerto\" were remakes of \"The Cat and the Canary\" (1927). Casting was done in July 1930 with the film being released later the same year. The Spanish version was directed by George Melford and, like the Spanish-language version of \"Drácula\", was filmed at night using the same sets as those used for filming the English-language version during the day.\n\nTovar shot \"Drácula,\" in 1930, when she was 20 years old. The film was produced by her soon-to-be husband, Paul Kohner.\n\nIn 1931, Tovar starred in the film \"Santa\", the first to have synchronized sound and image on the same celluloid strip.\n\nThe film was based on a famous book featuring an innocent girl from the country who has an affair with a soldier and then tragically becomes a prostitute. \"Santa\" was such a hit that the Mexican government issued a postage stamp featuring Tovar as Santa. \"I tell you I could not walk on the streets when \"Santa\" came out,\" Tovar said. \"People tore my dress for souvenirs. It was something.\" \n\nIn 2006, \"Santa\" was shown in a celebratory screening by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences called \"A Salute to Lupita Tovar\" that featured a conversation between Tovar and film historian Bob Dickson. The event was in honor of Tovar.\n\nIn 1931, Melford directed Tovar in another Universal picture, \"East of Borneo\", which starred Rose Hobart. Tovar also worked on films at Columbia Pictures. Although she herself did not make any silent films, with her earliest films released by Fox Film Corporation in the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system, some may have been released in silent versions for theaters not yet equipped for sound.\n\nTovar went by the nickname \"Lupita\" since she was a girl.\n\nDuring filming of \"Santa,\" which was done in Mexico, producer Paul Kohner had to return to Europe because his father was sick. It was this separation, and another the next year when Kohner was producing a film for Universal Pictures in Europe, that made Tovar realize she loved Kohner. Kohner proposed on the phone—he had previously tried to give her a ring—and Tovar went to Czechoslovakia to meet him. They were married, by a rabbi, in Czechoslovakia on October 30, 1932, at Kohner's parents' home.\n\nIn 1936, the couple had a daughter, Susan Kohner, a film and television actress, and, in 1939, a son, Paul Julius \"Pancho\" Kohner Jr., a director and producer. Their grandsons, Chris and Paul Weitz, are successful film directors.\n\nTovar owned a bassinet that would be used by several well known New Yorkers, including Julie Baumgold, a writer and her husband Edward Kosner, publisher of \"New York;\" Elizabeth Sobieski, a novelist and mother of actress Leelee Sobieski, Judy Licht, a TV newswoman, and her husband Jerry Della Femina, an advertising executive.\n\nThe release of the Spanish-language \"Dracula\" on home video in the early 1990s caused a revival of Tovar's films. \"It's like a dream being invited to all of these festivals and showings of my films.

{"id": "2077340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077340", "title": "KAZT-TV", "text": "KAZT-TV\n\nKAZT-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 7, is an independent television station licensed to Prescott, Arizona, United States and serving the Phoenix television market. The station is owned by the Londen family of Phoenix, and as such, is the only locally owned commercial English-language television station in the Phoenix market. KAZT's studios are located on Tower Road in Prescott, with a secondary studio and sales office in the Londen Center on Camelback Road in Phoenix. Its main transmitter is located atop Mingus Mountain (northeast of Prescott). Its signal is relayed through a network of seven low-power translators across central and northern Arizona, including KAZT-CD (UHF digital channel 36, also remapped to virtual channel 7 via PSIP) in Phoenix. The station is also carried on cable providers throughout the Phoenix market, as well as on the Phoenix DirecTV and Dish Network local feeds.\n\nWilliam H. Sauro obtained a construction permit on January 7, 1980, for a new channel 7 TV station to serve Prescott. The permit briefly carried the KNAZ call letters; during this time, Sauro sought a network affiliation for the new outlet and was ultimately denied by ABC. On September 29, 1980, the call letters were changed to KUSK. Ground was broken on the station's Prescott studios in November 1981, by which time Sauro's plans had dramatically changed, proposing the \"Neighborhood Television\" network of more than 140 low-power translators in major markets across the country to air KUSK's programming.\nKUSK first signed on the air on September 5, 1982. It initially produced local news and sports programming for northern Arizona, but those programs were cut back in a 1985 wave of layoffs. By the 1990s, channel 7 was running low-budget programming that mainly targeted northern Arizona, through its main transmitter transmitting from Mingus Mountain and a network of translators from Yuma to Payson, and from Casa Grande to Bullhead City. The station broadcast television series from the 1950s and old public domain movies (some of which were provided by America One and the American Independent Network), syndicated programs that were declined by other Phoenix stations, local talk shows, and home shopping programs from America's Store. Before the Arizona Diamondbacks began play in 1998, KUSK thrived on Major League Baseball telecasts, and aired San Diego Padres, Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants games.\nOn December 5, 1997, KUSK, Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, while the company reorganized. KUSK emerged from bankruptcy in May 2000. On November 30, 2001, KUSK reached an agreement to sell the station to the Londen family, who own Lincoln Heritage Life Insurance Company. The new owners officially took control of KUSK and its translator network on April 1, 2002.\nThe day after the Londen Group closed on its purchase, it relaunched the station with new call letters: KAZT-TV. It also adopted a new brand, AZ-TV, and a new slogan, \"Arizona's Own.\" They also gave the station a significant technical facelift, including a studio in Phoenix, and purchased stronger programming. The station transformed from a low-budget operation focused on Northern Arizona into a high-quality independent station more focused on Phoenix and a serious competitor to the Valley's long-successful independent, KTVK (channel 3). To help ensure that KAZT would \"do some good for Arizona\", the Londen family put together an advisory board of notable Arizonans, including Governor Jane Dee Hull, U.S. Representative Bob Stump, prominent local auto dealer Lou Grubb, Jerry Colangelo of the Phoenix Suns and Arizona Diamondbacks, and Michael Bidwill of the Arizona Cardinals. Company patriarch Jack Londen later said that he had bought the station as a 50th anniversary gift for his wife, Dodie.\n\nKUSK's Phoenix repeater was founded on January 22, 1985; the construction permit for the station, which was originally assigned the callsign K27AN, was granted to the Meredith Corporation, owners of KPHO-TV (channel 5). In August 1985, before the station was ever built, Meredith sold the permit to Arizona Metro Television Ltd., who constructed the station, then sold it to KUSK, Inc. in April 1986. On the 22nd of the month, the station signed on the air under Program Test Authority, but was not licensed until June 30, 1987. By 1993, it was an affiliate of Home Shopping Network (HSN). William H. Sauro, KUSK's president, became the licensee of the station in May 1994, and in December 1994, the station changed its callsign to KHSK-LP. Around that time, KUSK became accessible to Phoenix viewers on a second translator, K55EH, also owned by the Prescott flagship station.\n\nAs part of KUSK's network of stations, KHSK-LP and K55EH were included in the proposed sale to Harry Pappas for his Azteca Phoenix enterprise, but they were eventually sold to the Londen Group as part of the KUSK sale after the Pappas purchase failed to materialize. KHSK-LP initially kept its HSN affiliation, but on July 5, 2002, the Londen Group changed the station's callsign to KAZT-CA and relaunched the station as a translator of KAZT-TV. K55EH eventually became defunct.\n\nAfter KUTP (channel 45) signed on its digital signal on channel 26, their permanent allocation, KAZT-CA began to experience adjacent channel signal interference. The station requested Special Temporary Authority (STA) to shut off its analog signal and begin operating its digital signal on the same channel (called a \"flash cut\"). The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the STA on August 16, 2007, and KAZT-CA began broadcasting in digital on January 15, 2008. On August 4, 2008, KAZT-CA applied to move its signal to channel 36, citing displacement due to continuing interference from KUTP. The FCC granted the displacement application on September 10, 2009, and on December 7, KAZT-CA ended broadcasts on channel 27, commencing operations on channel 36 five days later.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn October 13, 2008, KAZT-DT and KAZT-CA launched a subchannel featuring programming from the Retro Television Network (RTV). On June 20, 2011, KAZT added MeTV to digital subchannel 7.3. On August 1, 2011, MeTV was moved to subchannel 7.2 with RTV moving to 7.3. MeTV also airs locally in Phoenix on Cox Communications digital channel 93. On September 17, 2012, RTV programming on 7.3 was replaced by the Home Shopping Network. On August 17, 2017, a fourth subchannel was added featuring programming from Charge!\n\nOn February 22, 2001, the station was granted a construction permit to build its digital companion channel on UHF channel 25, and in October 2002, after receiving a grant of Special Temporary Authority (STA) to operate at roughly the same service level as its analog station, KAZT-DT came on the air. The station made its temporary operations permanent in August 2006, and on October 17, 2006, it was licensed. KAZT-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on May 15, 2009. The station's digital signal moved from UHF channel 25 to VHF channel 7. On that date, the station surrendered the license for its channel 25 digital signal to the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nOn weekdays, KAZT-TV airs locally produced live talk shows, including \"Arizona Daily Mix\", co-hosted by former KPHO-TV anchor Catherine Anaya and Danielle Williams, produced in Phoenix, and \"Sandy and Friends\", hosted by Sandy Moss in Prescott.\n\nSome syndicated programs featured on KAZT include \"Rachael Ray\", \"Family Feud\" and \"Maury\". Saturday programming features repeats of select weekday programs, as well as a current-events show hosted by KFYI radio personality Mike Broomhead. Sundays are devoted to locally produced shows (including an early morning replay of Broomhead's show after an airing of the syndicated \"Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson\"), infomercials and religious programs including a live broadcast of the Catholic Mass from Cathedral of Saints Simon and Jude in Phoenix.\n\nAfter the Londens relaunched channel 7 as KAZT-TV, the station acquired a heavy amount of sports programming. It served as the television home of Arizona State University men's and women's basketball, baseball, and softball; Phoenix Mercury WNBA basketball, and Mountain West Conference college football telecasts. In 2003 and 2004, the station also televised preseason football games from the NFL's Arizona Cardinals. From 2006 to 2008, KAZT was the broadcast television home of the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes. On February 17, 2010, the station acquired the rights to broadcast eight games from the Arizona Rattlers of the revived Arena Football League. On January 10, 2015, AZ-TV entered into a partnership with Cox Communications to simulcast five Grand Canyon University Antelopes basketball games that are produced by Cox7 Arizona.\n\nKAZT previously maintained a network of low-power repeaters throughout Arizona, all of which are located within the Phoenix market. Only five of them remain.\n\nK19CX in Yuma formerly served the Yuma–El Centro market, but was required to drop KAZT programming on December 4, 2006, due to syndication exclusivity issues with other stations within that market. It became a repeater of KAET (channel 8) and was sold directly to Arizona State University in 2013.\n\n"}

Established as a gold mining town, it is now a quiet town with historic buildings a few kilometres east of West Wyalong, the major district service centre. At the , Wyalong had a population of 851.\n\nThe town of Wyalong was established in 1884.\n\nGold was discovered at Wyalong in September 1893 by Joseph Neeld. The \"Main Camp\" was erected on the eastern side of the main diggings with impressive government buildings being erected, now classified by the Heritage Trust as being worthy of preservation. The goldfield was named Wyalong by mining warden William Henry John Slee. At its peak in May 1894 there were more than 12,000 miners on the goldfields, digging deep vertical shafts and tunnels to access the quartz reefs which contained the gold. By the end of 1894 the number of miners had reduced to about 4,200. The Amalgamated Miners' Association of Australasia, a precursor of the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union, was active in the area, including organising eight-hour day processions (see ).\n\nThe Catholic Sisters of Mercy started their first school at St. Patrick's, Wyalong, in 1896 with 196 students and 6 Sisters. In 1899 Wyalong became a municipality with council chambers being erected, a courthouse, police station, post office and school of arts.\n\nHomes and businesses were initially built around the main mining area. In 1895 West Wyalong was developed around the bullock track further west. As mining declined West Wyalong became the main service centre for agriculture in the surrounding district, although for many years there was rivalry between the towns. Both towns wanted the Temora railway line, constructed in 1903, but settled on a compromise of a station midway between the two towns, called Wyalong Central.\n\nGold mining in the immediate area declined from 1910 and ceased by 1921. Old tailings were reworked by cyanide processing during the 1930s. In 2004 Barrick Gold is undertaking gold mining 43 km west at Lake Cowal through the process of in situ cyanide leaching, a variant of the controversial process of Gold cyanidation.\n\nDevelopment since the 1970s has expanded Wyalong in the direction of West Wyalong with several motels built at Central Wyalong. A shared bicycle and pedestrian track was constructed in 1994 to link Wyalong with West Wyalong.\n"}

The highway travels from its southern terminus at the Florida state line, where SR 3 and SR 300 both reach their southern terminus, concurrent with US 19. Here, US 19 travels concurrent with State Road 57, south-southeast of Thomasville. SR 3 travels through portions of Thomas, Mitchell, Dougherty, Lee, Sumter, Schley, Taylor, Upson, Pike, Spalding, Henry, Clayton, Fulton, Cobb, Bartow, Gordon, Whitfield, and Catoosa counties to its northern terminus at the Tennessee state line, in East Ridge, where US 41/US 76 continue, concurrent with State Route 8. It travels through Thomasville, Albany, Griffin, Atlanta, Calhoun, and Dalton.\n\nSR 3 starts at the Florida state line in Thomas County, and is concurrent with US 19 and SR 300 from its inception. SR 3 heads slightly northwest and skirts east past Thomasville, before heading through Pelham to Camilla in Mitchell County. SR 3 turns slightly northeast in Camilla and heads through Baconton, Georgia to Albany in Dougherty County, where its concurrency with SR 300 ends, before turning north and heading to Leesburg in Lee County. In Leesburg, the highway turns slightly northwest once more, travels through Smithville, and enters Sumter County.\n\nTurning north again, SR 3 continues through Americus and enters Schley County, curving slightly northwest to Ellaville. Leaving Ellaville in a northerly direction again, SR 3 bisects Schley County and heads into Taylor County and through Butler into Upson County. Just after entering Upson County, the highway turns northwest yet again and travels to Thomaston. Turning back to the north, SR 3 enters Pike County, and travels through Zebulon on its way slightly northeast to Griffin in Spalding County. South of Griffin, SR 3 intersects and begins a concurrency with US 41, in addition to its continued concurrence with US 19. SR 3 also features a brief freeway section as it travels through the western portion of Griffin.\n\nHeading north, the route enters the western portion of Henry County, and heads through Hampton, where the Atlanta Motor Speedway has direct access from the highway, which regularly sees massive backups on weekends when NASCAR races take place there. Continuing north into Clayton County, SR 3 heads through Jonesboro, and crosses I-75 in Morrow.\n\nHeading north through Forest Park, the highway first enters Fulton County, then crosses I-285, and I-75 again, as well as I-85, in quick succession, as it makes its way through the southern Atlanta suburban communities of Hapeville and East Point, forming one side of the perimeter of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport near Hapeville. Turning north, the highway parallels the Downtown Connector very closely, crosses I-20 in downtown Atlanta, and continues north, beginning and ending concurrencies with US 19, US 78, and US 278, as well as forming part of the western boundary of the campus of Georgia Tech. SR 3 subsequently crosses I-75 for a third and fourth time just northwest of where I-75 and I-85 split, and crosses I-285 once more east of Smyrna, just after having entered Cobb County.\n\nHeading northwest through Marietta and Kennesaw, the highway leaves the Atlanta area and enters Bartow County, through Emerson, Cartersville and Adairsville, and on into Gordon County. SR 3 heads through Calhoun, crosses I-75 for a fifth time just south of Resaca, and continues to head north into Whitfield County. Heading through Dalton, the route crosses I-75 yet again, before heading northwest into Catoosa County, where it crosses I-75 for the seventh and final time, before reaching its northern terminus at the Tennessee state line, south of Chattanooga. Here, US 41, joined by US 76, enters Tennessee, concurrent with unsigned state highway SR 8.\n\nThe following portions of SR 3 are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense:\n\nSR 3 was established at least as early as 1919 starting at the Florida state line southwest of Thomasville; no numbered highway extended south-southeast from that city at the time. SR 3 traveled on essentially the same path as it currently does. The main differences were the southern terminus and the northern terminus. It traveled north from Ringgold to the Tennessee state line. By the end of 1926, US 41 had been designated on the entire length of SR 3 from Griffin to the Tennessee state line. Seven segments of the highway had a \"completed hard surface\": a segment in the northern part of Thomasville, from approximately Ochlocknee to north-northeast of Camilla, from the Mitchell–Dougherty county line to Albany, from south of Americus to Ellaville, from north-northeast of Zebulon to just south of the Spalding–Henry county line, from just north of this county line to just south-southeast of the Henry–Clayton county line, and from just north-northwest of this county line to Marietta. Five segments of the highway had a \"completed semi hard surface\": a segment south of the Mitchell–Dougherty county line, from Leesburg to the Lee–Sumter county line, from Cartersville to the southeastern part of Calhoun, a segment in the northwestern part of Dalton, and from Ringgold to the Tennessee state line. Ten segments of the highway had a \"sand clay or top soil\" surface: a segment on both sides of the Grady–Thomas county line, a segment north-northwest of Thomasville, from Ellaville to north-northeast of Rupert, a segment just north-northeast of Butler, from the south end of the SR 22 concurrency to south-southeast of Thomaston, from south of the Upson–Pike county line to Zebulon, a segment in the northwestern part of Marietta, from just south of the Cobb–Bartow county line to Cartersville, from just south of the Gordon–Murray county line to Dalton, and from northwest of Dalton to Ringgold. Six segments of the highway were indicated to be under construction: a segment north of the Lee–Sumter county line, from south-southeast of Thomaston to north-northwest of that city, a segment north-northeast of Zebulon, from just south of the Spalding–Henry county line to just north of that line, from northwest of Marietta to just south of the Cobb–Bartow county line, and from the southeastern part of Calhoun to just south of the Gordon–Murray county line. By the end of 1929, US 19 was designated on the then-current highway from the Florida state line to Atlanta. Also, an unnumbered road was built on the current path of SR 3 south-southeast of Thomasville.\n\nBy the middle of 1930, SR 35 was designated on the unnumbered road south-southeast of Thomasville. Four segments of SR 3 had a completed hard surface: from Thomasville to Albany, from Leesburg to Ellaville, from south-southeast of Thomaston to north-northwest of that city, and from north-northeast of Zebulon to Ringgold. Two segments had a sand clay or top soil surface: from Butler to south-southeast of Thomaston and from north-northwest of that city to north-northeast of Zebulon. Two segments were under construction: from Albany to Leesburg and from Ringgold to the Tennessee state line. By the end of the year, the Albany–Ellaville segment and the Rinngold–Tennessee segment had a completed hard surface. A segment south of Zebulon had a sand clay or top soil surface. From the Florida state line to Thomasville and a segment north-northeast of Zebulon were indicated to be under construction. By the end of 1931, three segments had a completed hard surface: from the Florida state line to Thomasville, a segment north of Ellaville, and a segment north-northeast of Zebulon. Two segments were under construction: from north of Ellaville to Butler and a segment south of Zebulon. In January 1932, the entire highway from Florida to north of Ellaville had a completed hard surface. In April that year, the entire highway from south-southeast of Thomaston to the Tennessee state line had a completed hard surface. A segment south-southeast of Thomaston was under construction. Later that year, the segment from north of Ellaville to Butler had a sand clay or top soil surface. From Butler to the south end of the SR 22 concurrency was under construction. Before the year ended, this segment had a completed hard surface. The segment of SR 3 from the south end of SR 22 concurrency to south-southeast of Thomaston, as well as the segment of SR 35 in the southern part of Thomasville, was under construction. By the middle of 1933, the segment from north of Ellaville to Butler had a completed hard surface. The segment from the south end of the SR 22 concurrency to south-southeast of Thomaston had completed grading, but had no surface course. By the end of the year, all of the then-current path of SR 3 had a completed hard surface. In 1934, the segment north of Ringgold was shifted west to travel northwest from that city. A segment north-northwest of Thomasville, as well as the Pelham–Camilla segment, was under construction. By the end of the year, a segment of SR 35 south-southeast of Thomasville had a completed hard surface. From the Florida state line to south-southeast of the city, this segment was under construction. By April 1935, the central portion of the segment of SR 35 had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the end of the year, nearly the segment of SR 35 had a completed hard surface. By the middle of 1936, the entire segment of SR 35 had a completed hard surface. Late in 1937, US 19 south of Thomasville was shifted eastward to travel concurrently with this segment of SR 35, with US 319 designated on its former path southwest of Thomasville. SR 3 was split into two parts between Atlanta and the northwest part of Marietta. US 41/SR 3 traveled northwest on the original path, while SR 3E traveled north-northwest on a more eastern path between the two cities. SR 3E's path from SR 120 in the east part of Marietta to US 41/SR 3 in the northwestern part of the city. The rest of SR 3E was under construction. By the end of the year, SR 3W was established, traveling northwest with US 41 on Marietta Street and Old Marietta Road, while SR 3E traveled north-northwest on Hemphill Street and Northside Drive. All of SR 3E in the northern part of Atlanta was hard surfaced. From the north part of the city to the northwest part, the highway had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Later that year, all of SR 3E from Atlanta to northwest of the Fulton–Cobb county line had a completed hard surface.\n\nIn 1940, nearly the entire segment of SR 3E in Marietta had a completed hard surface. It was under construction from northwest of the Fulton–Cobb county line to the eastern part of Marietta. By the end of the next year, the entire length of SR 3E had a completed hard surface. By the end of 1946, SR 3W was projected to be designated from the western part of Albany to US 19/SR 3 north of the city. The SR 3W in Atlanta and Marietta was redesignated as part of the SR 3 mainline. By February 1948, SR 3E in Atlanta was moved off of Hemphill Avenue. It, along with US 41 Temp., followed US 19 on Spring Street, then traveled west on 14th Street and resumed the Northside Drive path. The segment of US 41 on SR 3W in this area was redesignated as US 41 Alt. By April 1949, US 41 Alt. was redesignated as US 41 Byp. US 41 Temp./SR 3E's southbound lanes traveled on Hemphill Avenue. The southern part of SR 3W in Albany was hard surfaced, while its northern part had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of 1950, US 41 Byp. was redesignated as part of the US 41 mainline. US 41 Temp./SR 3E was shifted off of US 19 on Spring Street and 14th Street, and traveled on Hemphill Avenue again. The entire length of SR 3W in Albany was hard surfaced. By the end of 1951, an \"Expressway\" (currently part of the I-75 path in the southern part of Atlanta) was built east of US 19/US 41/SR 3. In 1952, US 41 Temp. was redesignated as part of the US 41 mainline, which was shifted off of SR 3W and onto SR 3E. The next year, US 19/US 41/SR 3 was shifted eastward onto the \"Expressway\" in the southern part of Atlanta, traveled west on Lakewood Avenue, and then resumed the northern path. The former path became US 19 Bus./US 41 Bus. By June 1954, SR 3W was designated between Atlanta and Marietta. By June 1955, it was redesignated as SR 3. By July 1957, SR 3 in the northern part of Albany was redesignated as SR 3 Conn. due to the SR 3W in the city being redesignated as part of SR 3. Between Griffin and Lovejoy, SR 3 was shifted off of US 19/US 41 to the east.\n\nBy June 1960, I-75/SR 401 were designated on US 19/US 41/SR 3 in the southern part of Atlanta, ending at Lakewood Avenue. I-75/SR 401 was also designated on the concurrency from Northside Drive to Northside Parkway. SR 3 Conn. in Albany was redesignated as the SR 3 mainline, and its old path was redesignated as SR 3W. By June 1963, SR 333 was designated on US 19 from the Florida state line to Camilla, which truncated SR 35 Thomasville. SR 3's Thomasville–Meigs segment was shifted westward onto US 19 Bus. Its former path, on US 19, was redesignated as part of SR 333. SR 333 was also designated on a sole path from Camilla to Albany. The path of SR 3 in Thomaston was split into SR 3W and SR 3E. It was unclear as to which highway US 19 traveled on. SR 333 was designated on US 19/US 41 from SR 16 in Griffin to an indeterminate location between Jonesboro and Hapeville. SR 333 was designated on US 19/US 41 from Griffin to Lovejoy, and on US 19/US 41/SR 3 from there to south-southwest of Forest Park. By the end of 1965, US 19 between Camilla and Albany was shifted eastward to travel concurrently with SR 333. It was unclear if the northern terminus of SR 333 was truncated to Lovejoy or not. SR 3S was designated in Marietta from SR 3 to SR 5. SR 3 Conn. in Marietta was designated from SR 5 to SR 3. US 19/US 41/SR 3 was shifted onto the former path of US 19 Bus./US 41 Bus. in the Atlanta area. The northern terminus of US 19 Bus. in the southern part of the state was truncated to just east of Ochlocknee. In 1968, a northern extension of SR 333 was projected to be designated from its US 19/US 82/SR 50S interchange in the eastern part of Albany north and northwest to US 19/SR 3W in the northwestern part of the city.\n\nIn 1970, all of SR 333 north of Griffin was also decommissioned. In 1973, SR 3W in Albany was redesignated as SR 3, while its former path was redesignated as part of SR 133. In 1974, a freeway was built on the northern extension of SR 333 in Albany, but there was no indication as to what highways were designated on it. Three years later, US 19 through the main part of Albany was shifted northeast to travel concurrently with the SR 333 freeway. By March 1980, US 82 in Albany was also shifted onto the freeway. Between 1974 and March 1980, SR 3S in Marietta was redesignated as SR 3 Spur. Later that year, the northern terminus of SR 333 was truncated to the US 19/US 19 Bus./US 82/US 82 Bus./SR 50/SR 50 Bus./SR 62/SR 333 interchange in Albany, with SR 50 shifted onto the freeway. In 1982, all of SR 333 that remained was redesignated as SR 300. In 1983, the segment of SR 3 from the Florida state line to Thomasville was shifted eastward onto US 19/SR 300. All of SR 3 from the Meigs area to Albany was shifted eastward onto US 19/SR 300. Between 1978 and 1985, SR 3 Conn. in Marietta was decommissioned. Between March 1980 and 1985, SR 3 Spur in Marietta was decommissioned. In 1985, US 19/US 82/SR 3/SR 300 were designated on the freeway in Albany. It was named Liberty Expressway. Also, SR 3E in the Atlanta area was decommissioned. In 1986, US 19 Bus. in the southern part of the state was decommissioned. The next year, SR 3W in Thomaston was redesignated as SR 3S, and SR 3E there was redesignated as SR 3N. In 1988, SR 50 was truncated to its current eastern terminus, with its entire former path redesignated as part of SR 520. SR 3N in Thomaston was redesignated as the northbound lanes of SR 3, while SR 3W there was redesignated as the southbound lanes. In 2000, SR 3 between Thomasville and Meigs was shifted eastward onto US 19/SR 300. Its former path became SR 3 Alt.\n\nOn April 2, 1980, SR 3 was designated as the 'Andersonville Trail' at the concurrence of SR 3 with US 280 in Americus.\n\nOn May 4, 1992, SR 3 was designated as the 'Admiral Mack Gaston Parkway' where SR 3 connects SR 52 and SR 71 in Dalton.\n\nState Route 3 Alternate (SR 3 Alt.) is an alternate route of SR 3. It uses an older routing of US 19/SR 3 for between Thomasville and Meigs. At least as early as 1919, SR 3 traveled between Thomasville and Meigs, like it does today. By the end of 1926, a segment north-northwest of Thomasville had a \"sand clay or top soil\" surface. By the end of 1929, US 19 was designated on SR 3 in the state. By the middle of 1930, the segment of US 19/SR 3 between Thomasville and Meigs had a \"completed hard surface\". By June 1963, SR 333 had been designated on this stretch of US 19, with SR 3 being shifted westward onto US 19 Bus. By the end of 1965, the northern terminus of US 19 Bus. was truncated to just east of Ochlocknee. In 1986, US 19 Bus. was decommissioned. In 2000, the segment of SR 3 between Thomasville and Meigs was shifted eastward, onto US 19/SR 300. Its former path became SR 3 Alt.\n\nState Route 3 Connector (SR 3 Conn.) was a connecting route of SR 3 that existed completely in the city limits of Albany. It traversed portions of Dougherty and Lee counties. At least as early as 1919, SR 3 traveled on essentially the same path as it currently does through the Albany metropolitan area. By the end of 1926, the segment from the Mitchell–Dougherty county line to Albany had a \"completed hard surface\". By the end of 1929, US 19 was designated on the highway through Albany.\n\nBy the end of 1946, SR 3W was projected to be designated from the western part of Albany to US 19/SR 3 north of the city. By April 1949, the southern part of SR 3W was hard surfaced, while its northern part had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of 1950, the entire length of SR 3W was hard surfaced. By July 1957, SR 3 in the northern part of Albany was redesignated as SR 3 Conn. due to SR 3W being redesignated as part of SR 3. By June 1960, SR 3 Conn. was redesignated as the SR 3 mainline, and its old path was redesignated as SR 3W.\n\nState Route 3 Bypass (SR 3 Byp.) is a western bypass of the town of Leesburg in Lee County, which was completed in 2009. It is concurrent with US 19 Byp. for its entire length. The entire length of SR 3 Byp. is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense.\nThe portion of Tara Boulevard in Clayton County that is not covered by US 19/US 41/SR 3 near Interstate 75 (I-75) is designated as State Route 3 Connector (SR 3 Conn.). The route is little more than a high-capacity set of ramps to and from I-75 and is unsigned. Its entire length is just west of Morrow.\n\nState Route 3 Connector (SR 3 Conn.) is a connector route in the city limits of Atlanta. The entire length travels along the southeastern edge of Spelman College. It starts at an intersection with US 29/SR 14/SR 154, just northeast of an overpass for Interstate 20 (I-20). US 29/SR 3 Conn. travel north-northwest. Just before an intersection with Westview Drive, they curve to the northeast and meet the northern terminus of SR 3 Conn., an intersection with US 19/US 41/SR 3.\n\nState Route 3 Spur (SR 3 Spur) was a short-lived spur route of SR 3 that existed in the central part of the city limits of Atlanta. Between June 1963 and the beginning of 1966, it was established on the path of U.S. Route 41 (US 41; Northside Drive) from Marietta Street, where SR 3 split off of US 41, to an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75), where SR 3E began a concurrency with US 41. In 1969, it was redesignated as a southern extension of SR 3E.\n\nState Route 3 Spur (SR 3 Spur) was a spur route of SR 3 that existed in Marietta. At least as early as 1919, SR 3 traveled on essentially the same path as it currently does through the city. By the end of 1926, US 41 had been designated on the entire length of SR 3 in this area. This segment of US 41/SR 3 had a \"completed hard surface\".\n\nBy the end of 1965, SR 3S was designated in Marietta from SR 3 to SR 5. Between 1974 and March 1980, SR 3S was redesignated as SR 3 Spur. Between March 1980 and 1985, SR 3 Spur was decommissioned.\nState Route 3 Connector (SR 3 Conn.) was a connecting route of SR 3 in Marietta. it was designated from SR 5 to SR 3. In 1984, it was redesignated as part of SR 5.\nState Route 3 Connector (SR 3 Conn.) is a connector for SR 3 that exists entirely within the city limits of Marietta. It is known as Roswell Road for its entire length. It begins at an intersection with US 41/SR 3 (Cobb Parkway) in the east-central part of the city. Here, the roadway continues as Roswell Street. At this intersection is the Big Chicken restaurant of KFC. SR 3 Conn. proceeds to the east and has an incomplete interchange with the northbound lanes of Northwest Corridor Express Lanes of Interstate 75 (I-75). The highway then curves to the northeast and reaches its eastern terminus, an interchange with SR 120 (Marietta Parkway/Roswell Road) and the eastern terminus of SR 120 Alt. (Marietta Parkway).\n\nThe highway was formed in 2007 when SR 120 was rerouted out of downtown Marietta.\n\nState Route 3 Connector (SR 3 Conn.) is in Whitfield County south of Dalton; it connects Interstate 75 (I-75) to US 41/SR 3 and the Dalton Bypass.\n\nAll of SR 3 Conn., from I-75 to its eastern terminus, is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense.\n\n"}
{"id": "2077360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077360", "title": "Crash (1996 film)", "text": "Crash (1996 film)\n\nCrash is a 1996 Canadian-British psychological thriller film written and directed by David Cronenberg, based on J. G. Ballard's controversial 1973 novel of the same name. It follows a film producer (James Spader) as he becomes involved with a group of symphorophiliacs who are sexually aroused by car crashes. The film also stars Deborah Kara Unger, Elias Koteas, Holly Hunter, and Rosanna Arquette.\n\nThe film generated considerable controversy upon its release and opened to mixed and highly divergent reactions from critics. While some praised the film for its daring premise and originality, others criticized its combination of graphic sexuality and violence. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where it received the Special Jury Prize, a unique award that is distinct from the Jury Prize as it is not given annually, but only at the request of the official jury (for example, the previous year, both a Jury Prize and a Special Jury Prize were awarded). When then jury president Francis Ford Coppola announced the award \"for originality, for daring and for audacity,\" he stated that it had been a controversial choice and that certain jury members, \"did abstain very passionately.\" The award has not been given since. It received six Genie Awards from the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, including awards for Cronenberg as director and screenwriter; the film was also nominated in two further categories, including Best Picture.\n\nFilm producer James Ballard (James Spader) and his wife, Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger), are in an open marriage. The couple engage in various trysts but, between them, have unenthusiastic sex.\n\nTheir arousal is heightened by discussing the intimate details of their extramarital sex. She recounts sex that day with a stranger in a prop plane hangar, where she caresses the plane hull with her bare breast as the film's opening scene. She was, however, left unsatisfied. When Ballard replies he did not achieve satisfaction with his office sexual encounter that day, as he was interrupted, his wife replies \"maybe the next one\".\n\nWhile driving home from work late one night, Ballard's car collides head-on with another, killing its male passenger. While trapped in the fused wreckage, the driver, Dr. Helen Remington (Holly Hunter), wife of the dead passenger, exposes a breast to Ballard when she pulls off the shoulder harness of her seat belt.\n\nWhile recovering, Ballard meets Remington again, as well as a man named Bob Vaughan (Elias Koteas), who takes a keen interest in the brace holding Ballard's shattered leg together and photographs it. While leaving the hospital, Remington and Ballard begin an affair, one primarily fueled by their shared experience of the car crash (not only do all of their sexual assignations take place in cars, all of Remington's off-screen sexual encounters take place in cars as well). In an attempt to make some sense of why they are so aroused by their car wreck, they go to see one of Vaughan's cult meetings/performance pieces, a re-creation of the car crash that killed James Dean with authentic cars and stunt drivers. When Department of Transport officials break up the event, Ballard flees with Remington and Vaughan.\n\nBallard becomes one of Vaughan's followers who fetishize car crashes, obsessively watching car safety test videos and photographing traffic collisions. Ballard drives Vaughan's Lincoln convertible around the city while Vaughan picks up and has sex with street prostitutes and, later, Ballard's wife. In turn, Ballard has a dalliance with one of the other group members, Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette), a beautiful woman whose legs are clad in restrictive steel braces and who has a vulva-like scar on the back of one of her thighs, which is used as a substitute for a vagina by Ballard. The film's sexual couplings in (or involving) cars are not restricted to heterosexual experiences. While watching videos of car crashes, Remington becomes extremely aroused and gropes the crotches of both Ballard and Gabrielle, suggesting an imminent ménage à trois. Later, Vaughan and Ballard eventually turn towards each other and have sex while, also later, Gabrielle and Remington have sex with each other.\n\nAlthough Vaughan claims at first that he is interested in the \"reshaping of the human body by modern technology,\" in fact his project is to live out the philosophy that the car crash is a \"benevolent psychopathology that beckons towards us.\"\n\nThe film's climax begins with Vaughan's death in an intentional crash. It ends with another deliberate crash where Ballard rams his wife's car, as she unbuckles her seat belt intentionally. As he caresses her bruised body on the grass median near the crash, she replies that she is unhurt. As they lovingly copulate under the overturned car, the film ends with Ballard whispering in her ear, \"Maybe the next one\", implying their fetish involves death.\n\nThe film was an international co-production between the British company Recorded Picture Company, and Canadian companies Alliance Communications Corporation, The Movie Network, and Telefilm Canada.\n\nThe film was controversial, as was the book, because of its vivid depictions of graphic sexual acts instigated by violence.\n\nThe controversial subject matter prompted \"The Daily Mail\" and \"The Evening Standard\" to orchestrate an aggressive campaign to ban \"Crash\" in the United Kingdom. In response to this outcry, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) inquired with a Queen's Counsel and a psychologist, none of whom found any justification to ban it, and 11 disabled people, who saw no offense with its portrayal of the physically challenged. Seeing no evidence for a ban, \"Crash\" was passed by the BBFC uncut with an 18 rating in March 1997.\n\nThe film was still banned by Westminster Council, meaning it could not be shown in any cinema in the West End, even though they had earlier given special permission for the film's premiere, and it was easily seen in nearby Camden. In the United States, the film was released in both NC-17 and R versions. In Australia, a cut version rated R18+ was given a limited release; it was later released uncut on VHS in early 1997, and then on DVD in 2003. The American NC-17 version was advertised with the tagline \"The most controversial film in years\".\n\nAn academic study of the controversy and audience responses to it, written by Martin Barker, Jane Arthurs and Ramaswami Harindranath, was published by Wallflower Press in 2001, entitled \"The Crash Controversy: Censorship Campaigns and Film Reception\".\n\nIt has a 59% \"rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 51 reviews, with an average score of 6.59/10. The consensus reads: \"Despite the surprisingly distant, clinical direction, Crash's explicit premise and sex is classic Cronenberg territory.\" On Metacritic, the film's score is listed as 47 out of 100, as determined by 22 critics, signifying \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nIn his contemporary review, Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing:\n\n\"Crash\" is about characters entranced by a sexual fetish that, in fact, no one has. Cronenberg has made a movie that is pornographic in form, but not in result... [\"Crash\" is] like a porno movie made by a computer: It downloads gigabytes of information about sex, it discovers our love affair with cars, and it combines them in a mistaken algorithm. The result is challenging, courageous and original—a dissection of the mechanics of pornography. I admired it, although I cannot say I \"liked\" it.\n\nIn 2000, a poll done by \"The Village Voice\" of film critics listed \"Crash\" as the 35th Best Film of the 1990s. A similar poll done by \"Cahiers du cinéma\" placed it 8th. In 2005 the staff of \"Total Film\" listed it at #21 on their list of the all-time greatest films. Slant Magazine selected it as one of their \"100 Essential Films\".\n\nOn \"At the Movies with Roger Ebert\", director Martin Scorsese ranked \"Crash\" as the eighth best film of the decade.\n\nBBC film critic Mark Kermode has described \"Crash\" as \"pretty much perfect\" and praised Howard Shore's score, while admitting that it's a \"hard film to like\" and describing the cast's performances as \"glacial\".\n\nIn 2002 Parveen Adams, an academic who specializes in art/film/performance and psychoanalysis, argues that the flat texture of the movie, achieved through various cinematic devices, prevent the viewer from identifying with the characters in the way one might with a more mainstream movie. Instead of vicariously enjoying the sex and injury, the viewer finds himself a disimpassioned voyeur. Adams additionally notes that the scars borne by the characters are old and bloodless—in other words, the wounds lack vitality. The wound is \"not traumatizing\" but, rather, \"a condition of our psychical and social life\".\n\nThe film was nominated for the Golden Palm at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. In the end, it won the Special Jury Prize. It was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.\n\nIn 1996, the film won six Genie Awards from the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, including awards for Cronenberg as director and screenwriter and John Douglas Smith for \"Best Achievement in Sound Editing\". The film was also nominated in two further categories, including producer. \"Crash\" was also nominated in 1998 for the USA Motion Picture Sound Editors Award.\n\nThe film won in the category of Best Alternative Adult Feature Film Award at the 1998 Adult Video News Awards.\n\nAt the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was filed under the Founders Award, which lamented the year's biggest studio disgraces, and stated, \"How Oscar winner Holly Hunter and the usually reliable James Spader and Rosanna Arquette got suckered into this mess is a mystery.\"\n\n\n"}

It peaked at #10 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart. \n\nThe album represented a further shift from the strictly traditional folk music with which Baez had begun her career in that, for the first time, she included electric backup in the form of Bruce Langhorne's electric guitar. Additional musicians included Russ Savakus (bass) and Ralph Rinzler (mandolin). \n\nThe album takes its name from a Bob Dylan song, and includes a total of four Dylan songs, two of which were not officially released by Dylan until 1991. The album also features songs written by other folk singers such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, as well a German reading of \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone\".\n\nThe cover photo was taken by Richard Avedon. In the UK the title song was issued as a single on Fontana Records.\n\nThe 2002 reissue of the album by Vanguard features three previously unreleased additional tracks from the \"Farewell, Angelina\" sessions: \"One Too Many Mornings\", \"Rock, Salt, And Nails\", and \"The Water Is Wide\".\n\nIn a retrospective summary for Allmusic, Bruce Eder commented on how Baez was expanding along with the folk-rock of the 60s.

{"id": "2077393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077393", "title": "Summer vacation", "text": "Summer vacation\n\nSummer vacation (also called summer holiday or summer break) is a school break in summer between school years and the break in the school academic year. Students are typically off between eight and nine weeks but not staff, depending on the country and district. In the United States, summer break is approximately 2 to 3 months, with students typically finishing the school year between late-May and mid-June and starting the new year between late-August and early-September. In Azerbaijan, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Greece, Georgia, Lithuania, Latvia, Lebanon, Romania and Russia, the summer break is normally three months, compared to three to six weeks in Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany.\n\nThe research around the impact of summer vacation is mixed. The phrase \"summer slide\" was coined to describe the perceived loss of learning students experience due to interrupted education but the exact consequences of extended breaks is unclear. Advocates of breaks tend to focus on the need to give children time away the childhood stresses sometimes associated with school including peer pressure, cliques, bullying, and the pressure of heavy loads of homework.\n\nIn Argentina, the school year ends in early- or mid-December and starts late February or early March. Also the majority of students get two weeks of holidays during winter, which varies depending on the region of the country from late July or mid-July to early August.\n\nIn Australia, summer officially lasts from December to February, and therefore includes Christmas and New Year holidays. The dates of Australian school holidays (the term used, rather than \"vacation\") are determined by each state's Department of Education, the Christmas summer holiday being the longest in duration. Typically Christmas summer holiday in Australia last approximately six weeks, usually from late December (depending on school level) to late January. This is significantly shorter than North American summer holiday, but Australian schools also break for 2 weeks at Easter, and in June and September, giving students and teachers a total of twelve weeks of annual holidays. In many public schools, years 10 through 12 will finish before December 15, allowing time to complete exam marking and results. Year 10 commonly finishes at the end of November, Year 11 at the end of October, and year 12 (Senior Year) also at mid or the end of October after 3 weeks of end-of-year exams. This can bring the normal 12 weeks of vacation to 20 weeks of vacation. The intervening periods of school operation without holidays are called \"School Terms\", each term lasting approximately ten weeks. All Australian states have relatively similar holiday periods between each term, but there is the ability for this to change, as it did in the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games, when the first term in Victorian schools was shortened to 6 weeks and the other subsequently extended to 12 weeks due to severe disruptions to the public and private bus networks used by school students. Most private schools in Australia have up to four weeks of additional holidays, due to their longer teaching hours during term.\n\nIn Austria, summer vacation dates vary by region, however the break lasts nine weeks throughout the whole country. School usually ends in early July and starts in early September. \n\nIn Bangladesh, summer vacation begins in mid-May and ends in mid June (4 weeks). Also, in many schools, the holiday during the month of Ramadan (Around mid-May to around mid-April) is passed off as a summer vacation. The summer there is associated with the availability of fruits such as mangoes (আম / \"aam\") and jackfruits (কাঠাল / \"kaathaal\"). So, the summer vacation is sometimes known in Bangladesh as \"আম-কাঠালের ছুটি\", (pronounced as \"aam-kaathaaler chhuti\"), which roughly translates to \"mango-jackfruit's holiday\". Also, the summer vacation is sometimes not in line with the actual weather patterns during summer, resulting in students having to reach school in the heat.\nIt is to be noted that the summer vacations are not given much importance in places except schools.\n\nIn Barbados, summer holiday dates have varied throughout the years due to the beginning of the hurricane season on June 1. Because of this, major storms affecting the island can cause schools to remain closed for days resulting in a pushback of vacation dates, for example with Hurricane Tomas in 2010. Currently, summer holiday begins in late June or early July and ends in the second week of September.\n\nIn Belgium, summer vacation lasts in general from July 1 until September 1 (2 months). \n\nIn Bolivia, summer vacation runs from early December to early February (2 months).\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the start of summer break varies by school, but usually starts at the beginning or mid-June. School starts on the first Monday of September. \n\nIn Brazil, summer holidays vary by region, state and school administration.\n\nThe education system in Brazil is federalised, with Federal, State and Municipal schools, all of which can establish their own calendars, alongside that, every federal entity may maintain schools on any of the educational levels, meaning that even in the same town a Municipal-maintained High School, a State-maintained High School, and a privately-owned High School have differing calendars, resulting in summer holidays not being simultaneous throughout the country or even town.\n\nThe Federal Education Law (Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação Nacional) determines that both Primary and Secondary Education shall consist of a minimum of 800 hours a year, distributed between a minimum of 200 school days, allowing schools to plan for school years that extend beyond the mandatory minimum.\n\nIn terms of dates, summer holidays might last between 45 and 60 days; from late November — early December, to late January — early February.\n\nIn addition, for the majority of Brazilian students there are two to three weeks off for winter in July; the winter holidays were held in August for 2016 only due to the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn Bulgaria, the time of the break differs according to the grade of the students. The following periods are applied:\n\n1st-3rd grade: May 31 – September 15\n\n4th-6th grade: June 15 – September 15\n\n7th-11th grade: June 30 – September 15\n\n12th grade: School year ends in mid-May.\n\nNote that 8th grade classes that focus on intensive language learning's summer vacation also starts on the 30th of June, rather than the 15th.\n\nIn Canada, the first day of summer vacation for public schools is the last Saturday in June. However, in some provinces students get a Professional Activity day on the final Friday of that school week, and their last day would be on the Thursday. Depending on the province, students can get 2–3 months of summer vacation. This may vary in Quebec (earlier due to provincial June 24 holiday). The last day of summer vacation is Labour Day. This can vary in Private schools. School generally resumes the day after Labour Day (in September). \n\nIn Chile, summer vacation lasts from early or mid-December until late February or early March (10, 11 or 12 weeks).\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, summer holidays start in early July and often end in early September (2 months).\n\nIn Colombia, summer vacation varies. Because of Colombia's equatorial climate (see Climate of Colombia for more information), schools run two different calendars. Public schools and some private schools run \"Calendar A\" which has a break between June and July. Only some private schools run \"Calendar B\" in which there is a long vacation in July and August. \n\nIn Costa Rica, summer vacation lasts 2 months. Usually begin in late December and end in early February. There are a few schools using the \"american\" style, those school usually take vacations in late May and then resume again in early August.\n\nIn Croatia, the school year finishes around 15 June and it usually starts on the first Monday of September, but if the first Monday is on 1st or 2 September, the school year will start on the second Monday. \n\nIn the Czech Republic, summer holiday begins on July 1 and ends on August 31 (2 months).\n\nIn Denmark, summer break lasts from the end of June to early or mid-August (6 weeks) . High schools (colleges) usually return to school in early August, but for younger students it can be in the middle.\n\nIn Ecuador, summer vacation varies. Because of Ecuador's equatorial climate (see Climate of Ecuador for more information), schools run two different calendars. The Coastal region runs vacation January or February, but in the Sierra region, summer vacation follows the pattern in July and August.\n\nIn Egypt, summer break lasts from the beginning or the middle of June until the middle of September (3 Months – 14 Weeks) in public schools, though length slightly differs according to age. In most private schools, summer break lasts from the middle or end of June to the beginning of September (2.5 Months – 10 Weeks)\n\nIn Estonia, summer holidays start in the beginning of June, the date ranging for different grades. School begins every year on September 1.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the school year usually ends in late May to mid-June and begins in mid-September (8 to 12 weeks).\n\nIn Finland, summer vacation starts on Saturday (in week 22) in late May, or in the beginning of June. The vacation lasts for 2 to 2 months. Usually, school starts again on August 7 to 18. \n\nIn France, summer vacation usually consists of July and August (2 months), though secondary school students finish in mid-June due to the senior's exams. This may vary for private schools.\n\nIn Germany, summer vacation lasts six to six and a half weeks. The exact dates vary by state as well as from one to the next year, from the earliest (mid-June to late July) to the latest (late July to early September). In Germany the annual holidays are split into winter holidays (about one week), Easter holidays (mostly about two weeks), summer holiday (about six and a half weeks), autumn holidays (about one to two weeks) and Christmas holidays (about one to two weeks). Some states like Bavaria also have holidays for Pentecost. \n\nIn Greece, the summer vacation lasts for 3 months. Schools close on June 14 and reopen on September 11. Universities generally close in mid-July, but with great differences between faculties.\n\nIn Guatemala, the summer holidays start in middle October and end in early January (approx 12 weeks).\n\nIn Guyana, the summer holidays start in early July and end in early September (2 months).\n\nIn Hungary, summer vacation usually lasts from mid-June (15th) to early September (the first workday). This is about 11 or 12 weeks.\n\nIn Hong Kong, summer vacation normally begins in mid-July and ends on late August (6–7 weeks) for most public schools. However, the starting and ending times of international schools are variable. For example, most ESF-based schools start in late June and finish mid-August (7 weeks).\n\nIn Iceland, the duration of the summer vacation can vary from one school to another. Typically students start their summer vacation during the first week of June and return to school in the fourth week of August.\n\nIndia covers a wide spectrum of climates, resulting in a large variation in the start times and duration of summer vacation in different regions of the country.\n\nIn northern India, summer vacation typically begins in mid-May and ends by early July. The exceptions are the Himalayan states of Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh, where the summer break is short, and the winter break is much longer. For example, in the far northern state of Jammu & Kashmir, summer vacation is only for ten days, with a long winter break from mid-December to the end of February instead.\n\nIn central India, summer vacation begins in mid-April and schools re-open in mid-June.\n\nIn the south, schools finish in the last week of March and resume in early June.\n\nIn the north-eastern states, a new school year commences before the holidays, in April. A few weeks later, schools finish for summer vacation between May and June, during the hottest months of the year.\n\nMoreover, summer vacation lasts for no more than six weeks in most schools. The duration may decrease to as little as three weeks for older students, with the exception of two month breaks being scheduled to allow some high school and university students to participate in internship and summer school programs.\n\nIn Iran, summer vacation lasts three months. Schools close in mid June and reopen in late September. However most private high schools make it mandatory for students to attend school for around 2 months during summer. Meaning students will have a 2 week break after finals and another 2 week break before school starts again in late September.\n\nIn Iraq, summer vacation begins in late May and ends in late September, but the 12th grade vacation begins in late June and ends in mid-October, and 9th grade starts from mid-June to September.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, most secondary schools start summer holidays at the end of May or the start of June. However, Junior and Leaving Certificate exams will take place during June. Schools will usually open again at the end of August to the start of September. Primary schools in the Republic of Ireland are sixteen days longer, so they start their summer holiday at the end of June but do not return until the first week of September. Private schools in the Republic of Ireland follow the same pattern.\n\nThe summer vacation for middle school and high school students starts on June 21 and ends on August 31 (two months and 10 days) and the summer vacation for primary school students starts on July 1 and ends on August 31 (two months).\n\nIn Italy, summer vacation for elementary, middle and high schools normally starts on the second week of June and lasts until the second week of September included, for a total of three months.

School students officially get the same time off but there often is a one-week period before the vacation during which the student will only have to go to school for 2 days to receive their grade lists and bring back their books making the holiday 7 weeks unofficially for high school students. However, this does not apply to every school.\n\nIn New Zealand, the school holidays (the term used, rather than \"vacation\") typically start in mid-December, and end in late January or early February, which is usually 6-7 weeks. Senior secondary school students in Year 11, 12 and 13 finish in late-October for study leave, and their summer holidays begin after their last exam, which is different depending on the subjects they take.

University or polytech students do not start until mid-February or early March and finish in late-October or mid-November. \n\nIn Nigeria, primary and secondary Schools usually start Summer vacation in mid-July and resume in the early weeks of September. The vacation is also known as the \"3rd-term holiday\" and it is the longest break in a school year (typically up to two months). The \"first-term break\" starts between one and two weeks prior to Christmas and ends the first or second week in January, lasting for about three weeks. The \"first-term break\" is usually the shortest break in a school year. The \"second-term break\" usually starts a week before Easter and lasts for another three weeks. This gives a total of about 14 weeks of holiday in a year. The geographical location of the school is also a factor.\n\nTertiary institutions follow a different pattern, as the holiday in each school depends on various factors which include, the Course of study and the academic calendar of the school. Some tertiary institutions observe their Summer breaks in the normal summer period when elementary and high schools observe theirs, while others do not. Some courses of study also do not observe any significant holidays, such programmes include Engineering, Nursing, Medicine and a few others. This is usually as a result of students doing their laboratory work, workshop practice, Practicals, Internship etc. (as the case may be), while the other students in other programmes are on holiday. Tertiary schools observe two semesters; while some schools observe a break after the first semester, many others have their breaks combined to just the summer holidays. This long break helps the students get good jobs during the holiday. The total length of break observed in tertiary institutions in a year is 12 to 14 weeks.\n\nIn Norway, summer vacation typically lasts from mid June to mid August, for a minimum of 8 weeks.\n\nIn Oman, summer vacation starts in late May and ends in early September (3 months).\n\nIn Pakistan, Summer vacation lasts for two to three months depending on the type of school (public or private).

However, it is not uncommon for some schools in recent years to finish on the first week of July. \n\nIn Northern Ireland, most school summer holidays start in late-June and runs through to the beginning of September. Students doing exams (GCSEs and A-Levels) often get \"study leave\" from May and do the exams sometime in that month, or early-June. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, holiday dates for independent schools mostly differ from those of state schools; these differences typically take the form of an extra week's holiday at the beginning and end of each of the long holidays, meaning four weeks for the Christmas and Easter breaks and eight to ten weeks for the summer break, though variations in summer holidays length exist between independent schools themselves. The summer half-term break is determined by the break in public exams at the end of May. Some universities grant an extended \"exam leave\" to students which typically commences in early-April, so as to give students a good number of weeks to prepare for the summer exam season which usually starts in mid-to-late May and finishes in early or mid-June. Final year students at independent schools typically finish their time at school when their last exam in the summer exam season finishes, and as an encore; a special event is usually arranged for late-June by the school for leavers and staff as a way of providing an opportunity for final farewells to be bid. The universities they go on to typically schedule their first term to commence in early-October, giving school leavers an extended summer break between their time of leaving school and starting university.\n\nIn the United States, summer vacation lasts two to three months. The dates vary depending on the location of the school district but generally follow the same schedules; most schools in the Northeastern United States end in June and start the Wednesday after Labor Day (the first Monday in September, with teachers reporting back on Tuesday), while the majority of schools in the Southern United States have schools end in May and start again in August.\n\nWhile the origins of the summer holiday break are often believed to be rooted in agriculture and the idea children were needed to assist with planting and harvesting crops, this is inaccurate. Most crops were planted in the spring and harvested in the fall. The modern school calendar has its roots in 19th century school reform movements seeking standardization between urban and rural areas. Up until the mid-1800s, most schools were open for a winter and summer term. As individual schools merged into school districts and bureaucracies emerged to manage the newly formed school districts, school leaders and politicians identified a need to standardize calendars across regions. This standardization was related to the emerging tax structures, laws around compulsory education, as well as a general sentiment that school should be an essential component of American childhood.\n\nAs the calendar was standardized across regions, school leaders took cues from a variety of factors, including attendance rates and the difficulty cooling school buildings. Many upper class families left the city for cooler climates in the hot Northeast summer months, and as such schools cancelled their summer sessions due to low daily attendance. As train travel became more affordable, middle class families followed similar patterns, keeping their children home during the hottest months of the year or going away for a summer vacation. In addition to the heat and low attendance, many school leaders advocated for breaks so that students and teachers could rest their brains. Many 19th and early 20th century Americans educators believed that too much learning was bad for one's health and could result in injury. This was particularly true of younger children whose minds were still developing. The extended summer break was seen as a way for children and their teachers to rest and recover. In many places, teachers would use the summer months for their own learning and professional development, including participating in seminars and course like those held at Chautauqua. \n\nIn Uruguay, summer holidays usually begin in early December, and finish in early March (3 months). \n\nIn Venezuela, summer holidays begin in late June or early July and end in late September or early October.\n\nIn Vietnam, summer holidays usually begin in late May or early June and last for two months. \n\n"}

Among his best known models from this period are Kaoru from Japan and many of his subjects from Sweden. These photographs are generally regarded as tasteful and high in quality.

It takes the form of an arc of light, usually seen before a storm. Its cause is unknown, but speculation includes rotting vegetation, undersea releases of natural gas, and St. Elmo's fire.\n\nThe phenomenon has been the source of many a tall tale, and has been said to appear as a flaming three-mast galley much like the style of ship featured on New Brunswick's provincial flag.\n\nIn this version of the fireship tale, a Portuguese captain arrived on the shores of Heron Island in Baie des Chaleurs in 1501. Upon his second trip to the region to capture more Mi'kmaq natives for the slave trade, he was tortured and killed by the locals who had bitter memories of his first visit. A year later his brother came looking for him and was also attacked by the locals; their ship caught fire and they jumped into the waters and swore to haunt the bay for 1,000 years.\nIn several eye witness reports from early settlers on Heron Island, most notably the Pettigrew family, the ship is most often seen on the north side of the island, during the full moon. In a horrifying incident, Mrs. Pettigrew reported to be on her veranda at dusk one summers evening in 1878, when a ghostly figure of a sailor appeared at the corner of the farm house, and reportedly asked her to help him, see to his burns. When she turned away from the figure to run inside, it apparently brushed by her and to her horror she realized\nhe was legless. Victims, both Mi'kmaq and Portuguese of the sinking, reportedly washed up on the shores of the island, and were buried in shallow graves at French Woods, a low-lying area at the west tip of the island.\n\nThis Restigouche lady's version tells of a group of pirates who killed a woman. With her dying words she cast a curse upon them that \"For as long as the world is, may you burn on the bay.\"\n\nSailors aboard a ship heading to sea in bad weather feared they would die and blamed their bad luck on one of their own whom they murdered. When the ship caught fire, it was told that it was Catholic blood reaping its vengeance.\n\nDr. J. Orne Green a professor from Harvard Medical School investigated and concluded it was a natural phenomenon, electrical in nature.\n\nProf William Francis Ganong who visited the area, believed the Fireship of Baie des Chaleurs to be a case of St. Elmo's fire. He wrote a paper on the subject in 1906.\n\nG. L. Ellis a geologist from Newnham College, Cambridge speculated that the fireship might be marsh gas that had drifted over water.\n\n"}

Around 300 BC, Gongsun Long wrote this dialectic analysis of the question \"Can one legitimately assert '\"white horse\" is not \"horse\"'?\", in a work now named for him, \"Gongsun Longzi\", in a segment called the \"White Horse Dialogue\" ().\n\nThe White Horse Dialogue (\"Baima Lun\") constitutes chapter 2 of the eponymous \"Gongsun Longzi\". The purported author, also known as Master Gongsun Long, was counted among the School of Names ( the Logicians or the Dialecticians) in the Hundred Schools of Thought. Most of Gongsun's writings have been lost and the received \"Gongsun Longzi\" text only contains six of the supposedly 14 original chapters. Parts of the text are dislocated and some commentators and translators rearrange them for clarity. The dialogue is between two unnamed speakers:\n\nThis dialogue continues with deliberations over colored and colorless horses and whether \"white\" and \"horse\" can be separated from \"white horse\".\n\nOther \"Gongsun Longzi\" chapters discuss \"Baima\"-related concepts of: \"jian\" 'hard; hardness', and \"bai\" 'white; whiteness', \"ming\" 'name; term', \"shi\" 'solid; true, actual; fact, reality', the abstract \"zhi\" 'finger; pointing; designation; universal' (like \"whiteness\"), and the concrete \"wu\" 'thing; object; particular' (like \"a white horse\").\n\nThe 'paradox' can be resolved by recognizing that the lack of articles in the Chinese language contributes to semantic ambiguity. Without grammatical articles, it is unclear whether each 'horse' () in the statement \"A white horse is not a horse\" () refers to 'a horse', 'the (desired) horse', 'all horses', or 'horsekind'. This can be seen clearly by expressing the paradox in English using articles: suppose that one desires yellow or black horses, then a white horse would not be the (desired) horse. The Advocate's sophistry in the White Horse Dialogue is due to his confounding 'a horse' with 'the (desired) horse'.\n\nAccording to A. C. Graham, this \"A white horse is not a horse\" paradox plays upon the ambiguity of whether the 'is' in the statement means:\n\nIn other words, the expression \"white horse is not horse\" is ambiguous between \"\"white horse\" is not synonymous with \"horse\"\" (true, because \"white horse\" is more specific than \"horse\"), versus \"a white horse is not a member of the set of horses\" (obviously false). The Advocate in the dialogue is asserting a lack of identity between horses and white horses, while the Objector is interpreting the Advocate's statement as a claim that the category of horses does not include white ones.\n\nBeyond the inherent semantic ambiguities of \"baima fei ma\", the first line of the White Horse Dialogue obscurely asks \"ke hu\" , 'Can it be that ...?'. This dialogue could be an attempted proof that a white horse is not a horse, or a question if such a statement is possible, or both. Bryan W. Van Norden suggests that \"the Advocate is only arguing that 'a white horse is not a horse' be true, given a certain interpretation. He might acknowledge that, in another interpretation, 'a white horse a horse.\n\nAn alternative interpretation is offered in Feng Youlan's \"History of Chinese Philosophy\":\n\nHowever, there are recent histories of Chinese philosophy do not subscribe to Feng Youlan's interpretation. Other contemporary philosophers and sinologists who have analyzed the dialogue include Graham, Hansen, Harbsmeier, Thompson, and Van Norden.\n\nIn the Chinese philosophical tradition, the White Horse Dialogue's significance is evident from how many Chinese classic texts directly or indirectly discuss it. The \"Liezi\", which lists and criticizes the paradoxes of Gongsun Long as \"perversions of reason and sense\", explains \"'A white horse is not a horse', because the name diverges from the shape.\"\n\nTwo \"Zhuangzi\" chapters (17 and 33) mock Gongsun Long, and another (2) combines his \"zhi\" 'attribute' and \"ma\" 'horse' notions in the same context:\n\nThe \"Mengzi\" (6A4) notes that \"bai\" 'white' has different connotations whether one is using it to refer to a graying person (who is worthy of respect because of his or her age) or a white horse (which should be treated like any other animal):\n\nOther early \"a white horse is not a horse\" references are found in the \"Hanfeizi\" (32), \"Mozi\" (11B), and \"Zhanguoce\" (4).\n\n\n\n"}

A fraction of a second later, a powerful electric current is sent down this plasma channel and delivered to the target, thus functioning overall as a large-scale, high energy, long-distance version of the Taser electroshock gun.\n\nAlternating current is sent through a series of step-up transformers, increasing the voltage and decreasing the current. The final voltage may be between 10 and 10 volts. This current is fed into the plasma channel created by the laser beam.\n\nA \"laser-induced plasma channel\" (LIPC) is formed by the following process:\n\nBecause a laser-induced plasma channel relies on ionization, gas must exist between the electrolaser weapon and its target. If a laser-beam is intense enough, its electromagnetic field is strong enough to rip electrons off of air molecules, or whatever gas happens to be in between, creating plasma. Similar to lightning, the rapid heating also creates a sonic boom.\n\nMethods of use:\nBecause of the plasma channel, an electrolaser may cause an accident if there is a thunderstorm (or other electricity sources such as overhead powerlines) about. (\"See\" Taser \"for more information – principles of operation, controversies, etc\".)\n\nAn electrolaser is not presently practical for wireless energy transfer due to danger and low efficiency.\n\nPublicly traded company Applied Energetics (formerly Ionatron) develops directed-energy weapons for the United States military. The company has produced a device called the Joint IED Neutralizer (JIN) which was deemed unfit for field use in 2006. The JIN is intended for safely detonating improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Future designs include weapons mounted on land, air and sea vehicles and as a hand-held infantry version.\n\nApplied Energetics said that the weapons will be able to be used as a non-lethal alternative to current weaponry, but will be able to deliver a high enough voltage jolt to kill.\n\nApplied Energetics say that they are working on an electrolaser system, called LGE (Laser Guided Energy). They are also studying a laser-induced plasma channel (LIPC) as a way to stop people from going through a corridor or passageway.\n\nThere was an unconfirmed report that in 1985 the U.S. Navy tested an electrolaser. Its targets were missiles and aircraft. This device was known as the Phoenix project within the Strategic Defense Initiative research program. It was first proved by experiment at long range in 1985, but this report may have referred to an early test of MIRACL, which is or was a high-powered chemical laser.\n\nHSV Technologies, Inc. (Stood for the last names of the original founders, Herr, Schlesinger and Vernon; this is NOT the same company as Holden Special Vehicles), formerly of San Diego, California, USA, then Port Orchard, WA, designed a non-lethal device which was profiled in the 2002 \"TIME\" magazine article \"Beyond the Rubber Bullet\". It is an electrolaser using ultraviolet laser beams of 193 nm, and promises to immobilize living targets at a distance without contact. There is plan for an engine-disabling variation for use against the electronic ignitions of cars using a 248 nm laser. The lead inventor, Eric Herr, died in 2008 and the company appears to have been dissolved, as their website now hosts an unrelated business (as of 9/2015) \n\nScientists and engineers from Picatinny Arsenal have demonstrated that an electric discharge can go through a laser beam. The laser beam is self-focusing due to the high laser intensity of 50 gigawatts, which changes the speed of light in air. The laser was reportedly successfully tested in January 2012.\n\nThere have been experiments in using a laser beam as path to discharge natural electric charges in the air, causing \"laser-triggered lightning\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2077506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077506", "title": "Partners In Health", "text": "Partners In Health\n\nPartners In Health (PIH) is a Boston-based nonprofit health care organization founded in 1987 by Paul Farmer, Ophelia Dahl, Thomas J. White, Todd McCormack, and Jim Yong Kim.\n\nThe organization's goals are \"to bring the benefits of modern medical science to those most in need of them and to serve as an antidote to despair.\" It provides healthcare in the poorest areas of developing countries. It builds hospitals and other medical facilities, hires and trains local staff, and delivers a range of healthcare, from in-home consultations to cancer treatments. It also removes barriers to maintaining good health, such as dirty water or a lack of food, and strengthens the rights of the poor. The approach trades charity for “accompaniment,” which is described as a “dogged commitment to doing whatever it takes to give the poor a fair shake.” While many of its principles are rooted in Liberation theology, the organization is secular. It forms long-term partnerships with, and works on behalf of, local ministries of health. PIH currently holds a 4 out of 4 stars rating from Charity Navigator, a nonprofits evaluator.\n\nPartners In Health began in 1987, after Paul Farmer and Ophelia Dahl helped set up a community-based health project called Zanmi Lasante (\"Partners in Health\") in Cange, Haiti. The organization initially focused on treating people with HIV/AIDS in rural Haiti. PIH now embraces a holistic approach to tackling disease, poverty, and human rights in a variety of countries.\n\nIn 1993, Farmer used the proceeds from his John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Award to create a new arm of Partners In Health, the Institute for Health and Social Justice. Its mission is to analyze the impact of poverty and inequality on health, and to use findings to educate academics, donors, policy makers, and the general public. PIH's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Joia Mukherjee, directs the Institute.\n\nPartners In Health collaborates closely with Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\nAt the invitation of local governments, it strengthens and sustains public health systems in remote, rural areas. It trains and hires local healthcare workers, many of whom actively find patients in their communities and help them get care. It helps local experts conduct academic research that leads to clinical innovation.\n\nFamous supporters include Hank and John Green,Madonna, Meryl Streep, Ryan Lewis, Win Butler, Régine Chassagne of Arcade Fire, and Matt Damon.\n\nZanmi Lasante (“Partners In Health” in Haitian Creole) is PIH's flagship project. The small clinic that started treating patients in the village of Cange in 1985 has grown into the Zanmi Lasante (ZL) Sociomedical Complex, a 104-bed hospital with two operating rooms, adult and pediatric inpatient wards, an infectious disease center (the Thomas J. White Center), an outpatient clinic, a women's health clinic (Proje Sante Fanm), ophthalmology and general medicine clinics, a laboratory, a pharmaceutical warehouse, a Red Cross blood bank, radiographic services, and a dozen schools.\n\nThe organization also works in 11 other sites across Haiti's Central Plateau and beyond. Zanmi Lasante is Haiti's largest nongovernmental healthcare provider, serving 4.5 million. It employs 5,700 Haitians, including doctors, nurses, and community health workers.\n\nPIH's community-based model has proved successful in delivering effective care both for common conditions like diarrhea, pneumonia, and childbirth that are often fatal for Haiti's poor and malnourished, and for complex diseases like HIV and tuberculosis. A key to this success and to the PIH model of care pioneered in Haiti has been training and hiring thousands of \"accompagnateurs\" (community health workers). The PIH model of accompagnateur care is outlined in the 5-SPICE framework, a scholarly article detailing the tenets of a successful community health worker program.\n\nThe use of accompagnateurs is one of the most effective ways of removing structural barriers to adequate treatment of HIV and other chronic diseases while increasing job growth in communities that desperately require employment to further benefit the community's social structure. Focusing on minimizing the implications of structural violence is the key to the PIH model's success and to the improvement of treatment of chronic disease in rural Haiti.\n\nAs ZL has expanded, it has partnered with other nongovernmental organizations and the Haitian Ministry of Health to rebuild or refurbish existing clinics and hospitals, introduce essential drugs to the formulary, establish laboratories, train and pay community health workers, and complement Ministry of Health personnel with PIH-trained staff. Clinics that previously stood empty now register hundreds of patients each day at twelve sites—Cange, Boucan Carré, Hinche, Thomonde, Belladère, Lascahobas, Mirebalais, and Cerca La Source in the Central Plateau plus additions in the Artibonite region: Petite Rivière, Saint-Marc and Verrettes. In 2008, ZL recorded more than 2.6 million patient visits at clinical sites.\n\nWhen an earthquake struck Haiti on January 12, 2010, PIH/ZL resources were in place to deliver aid. In addition to providing care to the hundreds of thousands who fled to Haiti's Central Plateau and Artibonite regions, ZL established health outposts at four camps for internally displaced people in Port-au-Prince. ZL also supported the city's General Hospital (HUEH) by facilitating the placement of volunteer surgeons, physicians and nurses, and by aiding the hospital's Haitian leadership.\n\nThe earthquake leveled most of the health facilities in and around Port-au-Prince, including Haiti's only public teaching hospital and nursing school, so in March 2010, PIH/ZL responded to an urgent appeal from the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) by announcing the Stand With Haiti campaign, a 3-year, $125 million plan to help Haiti rebuild. The plan included a scaled-up version of an already planned hospital, the Mirebalais Hospital.\n\nBefore January 12, 2010, PIH had been planning to build a new community hospital in Mirebalais. After the earthquake, the organization quickly scaled up plans. Less than six months after the earthquake, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) and PIH/ZL broke ground on the world-class national referral hospital and teaching center.\n\nIn October 2012, Partners in Health finished construction on the Hôpital Universitaire de Mirebalais in Haiti. The hospital provides primary-care services to about 185,000 people in Mirebalais and two nearby communities. It is also intended to serve most of the country for secondary and tertiary care. The hospital opened its doors in March 2013.\n\nThe hospital provides high-quality education for Haitian nurses, medical students, and resident physicians. It has telecommunication technologies installed in meeting and operating rooms than link US-based medical professionals to help educate and train students and residents working there. Also, Partners in Health helped to establish an emergency department in the hospital. The organization has incorporated community health workers into their treatment regimen for their patients. Community health workers make necessary house visits to patients, deliver stipends and other essentials for patients' care, and keep record of their patients' progress at the hospital.\n\nSince 1996, PIH's sister organization in Peru, Socios En Salud (SES), has been providing medical services in Lima. Based in the northern Lima district of Carabayllo, SES is now Peru's largest non-governmental health care organization, serving an estimated population of 700,000 inhabitants, many of whom have fled from poverty and political violence in Peru's countryside. As a valued partner to Peru's Ministry of Health, SES has also influenced national policies for prevention and treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV and provides important training and support to help implement those policies nationwide.\n\nSES also provides a variety of services. SES provides food baskets, transportation, lodging and other forms of support for impoverished patients. The project also provides opportunities for income generation projects, job skills training, and small business loans. One example is Mujeres Unidas (\"Women United\"), a cooperative workshop that participates in crafts fairs in Peru and has sold handicrafts as far away as the United States, Japan and Switzerland.\n\nSES has treated more than 10,500 people for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Lima. SES is conducting the world's largest TB research study, the EPI Project. Funded by a National Institutes of Health grant of US$6 million in 2007, the project seeks to understand how MDR-TB and XDR-TB spreads among people living in close quarters.\n\nThe residents of the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, including millions of indigenous Maya, have long struggled with poverty, political violence, and dismal health conditions. Chiapas has extremely high rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, and tuberculosis compared to other states in Mexico. Partners In Health, known locally as Compañeros En Salud, began working in Mexico in 2011. CES aims to provide a more reliable, community-based alternative by training and employing local community health promoters, called \"promotores\".\n\nEl Equipo de Apoyo en Salud y Educación Comunitaria (EAPSEC, The Team for the Support of Community Health and Education) was established in 1985 by a small group of Mexican health promoters. They initially worked with Guatemalan refugee communities in the Chiapas border region, and later expanded their work to other marginalized people in Chiapas. EAPSEC believes that \"a life of dignity\" is a human right. This includes a strong public health system that responds to the most pressing health needs of the population, and access to high quality health care.\n\nSince 1989, PIH has collaborated with EAPSEC to improve medical infrastructure in the region and to recruit and train hundreds of \"promotores.\" Over the past two decades, EAPSEC has partnered with dozens of indigenous and rural communities throughout Chiapas to develop local health capacity. Recent work has focused on a network of communities in the area of Huitiupan in the highlands and around Amatan. EAPSEC is dedicated to helping communities build self-sufficiency and counts many successful community health groups throughout Chiapas among its \"alumni.”\n\nPartners In Health's work in Russia has a narrower medical focus over a vastly wider geographical area than any of its other projects. From a base in the region of Tomsk Oblast, Siberia, PIH has been working since 1998, in collaboration with the Russian Ministry of Health, to combat one of the world's worst epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). As of 2014, 39,000 Russians had the disease. In partnership with the Division of Social Medicine and Health Inequalities (DSMHI) at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, PIH has focused on improving clinical services for MDR-TB patients in Tomsk while undertaking training and research to catalyze change in treatment of MDR-TB across the entire Russian Federation.\n\nPartners In Health began working with local clinicians to improve treatment of MDR-TB in Tomsk in 1998. The joint effort got a major boost in 2004, when a five-year, $10.8 million grant was secured from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria for efforts to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of TB and MDR-TB. Key components of the clinical effort include improving diagnostics in order to detect cases earlier, developing a comprehensive strategy to promote adherence among patients, improving infection control in hospitals and clinics and decreasing transmission of TB to HIV-positive patients. Work in Tomsk also encompasses health education for the public and clinical and program management training for medical personnel in Tomsk.\n\nPartners In Health operates in two other states in Russia, Voronezh and Karelia, where technical assistance is provided to regional tuberculosis services.\n\nBo-Mphato Litšebeletsong tsa Bophelo/Partners In Health in Lesotho was PIH's second project in Africa and the first in a country with extremely high prevalence of HIV. Approximately one quarter of Lesotho's adult population is HIV-positive and life expectancy in the country is 55 years for women and 52 for men. In addition, the Basotho people are being ravaged by a tuberculosis epidemic. Lesotho's TB rate is among the highest in the world, and TB spreads rapidly and is particularly deadly where many people's immune systems are weakened by HIV. The PIH project in Lesotho was launched in 2006 following an invitation from the Lesotho's Ministry of Health and consultation with the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI, now known as the Clinton Health Access Initiative) about where to replicate that model elsewhere in Africa.\n\nPartners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima (IMB) has been working in Rwanda since 2005. In partnership with the Government of Rwanda and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), IMB's work supports the Ministry of Health to comprehensively strengthen the public health system in rural, underserved areas of the country. Initially, PIH and CHAI began by implementing a pilot project in two rural districts, Kayonza and Kirehe, in Rwanda's Eastern Province. Building off of PIH's approach in Haiti, the project was designed as a comprehensive primary health care model within the public sector. The approach used HIV/AIDS prevention and care as the entry point to build capacity to address the major health problems faced by the local population. Haitian physicians, nurses, and managers traveled to Rwanda extensively in the early years of the program to provide training and program design assistance.\n\nIn January 2011, PIH supported the Ministry of Health of Rwanda in the opening of Butaro District Hospital. The hospital, located in Burera district, has 156 beds.\n\nIn September 2015, Partners In Health inaugurated University of Global Health Equity, a non-for-profit organization offering a two-year part-time master's degree in Global Health Delivery. Construction began in September 2016 on the first phase of a campus located in Butaro. The new campus officially opened in January 2019.\n\nIn early 2007, Abwenzi Pa Za Umoyo (APZU; Partners In Health in Chichewa), started treating patients and training community health workers in the southwestern corner of Malawi, one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in Africa.\n\nThe Clinton-Hunter Development Initiative (CHDI) targeted Malawi as a country desperately needing a rural health project to address the devastating HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region. About 14 percent of Malawi's adult population is infected with HIV and hundreds of thousands of children have been orphaned by the disease. CHDI asked Partners In Health to replicate the rural initiative programs that have proven so successful in delivering HIV treatment and comprehensive primary health care in Rwanda and Lesotho.N The Malawi Ministry of Health directed PIH and CHDI to the impoverished rural area of Neno.\n\nIn 2010, APZU tested 17,606 patients for HIV. The organization clinics logged 332,619 patient visits. APZU supported 889 children, allowing them to attend school and receive food.\n\nIn late 2014, PIH heeded calls from the governments of Liberia and Sierra Leone, and other international partners, to join the fight against Ebola in West Africa. Although PIH is not an emergency response organization, they felt the moral obligation to join the response, given the unprecedented nature of the outbreak in West Africa.\n\nPIH arrived in Sierra Leone at a time when the situation was worsening every day. Within a matter of weeks, PIH transitioned from planning to implementation, and scaled operations in Sierra Leone to address the growing needs of the population and help tackle an exponentially worsening Ebola epidemic. They began in Port Loko District at the Maforki Ebola Treatment Unit and scaled up from there to ultimately provide clinical care at 16 facilities across 4 districts, and manage a network of more than 1,000 Ebola response community health workers, providing surveillance, support and referrals in rural communities.\n\nFrom the outset of the emergency response, PIH took a health systems strengthening approach, focused on working together with government to support the public sector response. As Ebola was brought under control, PIH shifted quickly to supporting the Ministry of Health in rebuilding its ravaged health system. Today PIH's Sierra Leone program is focused on raising the standard of care for the poorest and most marginalized through programs in Kono and Port Loko Districts, with a focus on maternal health, HIV/TB and Ebola survivor care.\n\nPIH began work in Liberia in November 2014, focused on responding to Ebola in Maryland County, a 20-hour drive south from the capital of Monrovia. They supported two Ebola treatment units and three community care centers, and taught teachers and community members new techniques to slow the spread of infections. Since Ebola came under control in Liberia in March 2015, PIH has focused on helping rebuild the health system, primarily for a population of roughly 100,000 in Maryland County.\n\nPIH also supports partner projects in the following countries:\nPIH also previously worked in Kazakhstan and the Dominican Republic\n\n\n"}

Andrews was born in Seattle, Washington, and attended film school in Los Angeles before his band Failure received a record deal from Slash Records.\n\nHe is best known as co-founder, lead vocalist, guitarist, bassist and co-songwriter of the alternative rock band Failure. He has also played in Replicants, a cover band side project that also included members of Tool. After the breakup of Failure in 1997, he also recorded music under the moniker ON, and later assembled and fronted the band Year of the Rabbit. He has performed as a solo artist, as well as collaborating in a self-described \"digital band\" called Digital Noise Academy with Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Sharky Laguana (Creeper Lagoon), Jordon Zadorozny, and Charlotte Martin (whom Andrews married in 2005), among others. In 2014, Andrews reunited with Failure members Greg Edwards and Kellii Scott. They embarked on a North American tour, which included two dates performing alongside A Perfect Circle and Puscifer for the celebration of Maynard James Keenan's 50th birthday.\n\nApart from his work as a musician, Andrews has also produced and/or mixed material for many artists, such as Nine Inch Nails, Beck, Lostprophets, Pete Yorn, A Perfect Circle, Tenacious D, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Candlebox, Mae, and others. Also notable is his participation in the production of \"You Know My Name\", the theme for the 2006 James Bond movie \"Casino Royale\", performed by Soundgarden/ex-Audioslave frontman Chris Cornell.\n\nIn March 2007, Andrews released \"Secrets of the Lost Satellite\", his first solo album under his own name, and helped oversee its release via his own label, Dinosaur Fight Records. The initial inspiration for the album came when he was invited by Beck to contribute to songs that he and his backing band were working on for the \"Nacho Libre\" soundtrack, recording sessions which Andrews described as \"one of the most exciting of my life\". Beck's live musical director, session musician Justin Meldal-Johnsen, was already a friend of Andrews', and shortly afterward, they and other members of Beck's band (including Matt Mahaffey of Self) began working on material that eventually became the album. Andrews also brought in another old friend, Jordon Zadorozny of Blinker the Star, to assist with songwriting and arrangements, and Zadorozny also ended up playing various instruments on some songs, as well. Both Meldal-Johnsen and Zadorozny are listed as co-producers of \"Secrets of the Lost Satellite\". Andrews went on tour that spring for the first time since 2003, with the opening band, San Diego's First Wave Hello, also serving as his backing band.\n\nThe members of Failure and Tool have been friends since the early 1990s; the two bands toured together repeatedly, and some members collaborated occasionally. Andrews is often credited for directing the music video for Tool's \"Hush\", but this is incorrect. He did, however, edit the video for their later single \"Prison Sex\". Andrews is also mistakenly credited with involvement in the post-grunge arena-rock band Neon Steam Dreams; that Andrews is a different musician by the same name. In May 2014, the Cinquanta concert with Tool, A Perfect Circle and Failure was held as a 50th Birthday Celebration for Maynard James Keenan, who asked for the band to reunite for that concert. Keenan stated, \"This was the perfect opportunity to tick off one of my bucket list items in the form of a Failure reunion. What better birthday present could one ever hope for?\" Failure, however, performed their first reunion show at the El Rey Theater on February 13, 2014, before the event.\n\nHe was featured on an episode of WIRED Science discussing the pros and cons of digital vs. analog recording. Andrews argued that more can be done (with greater ease) with digital while Steve Albini argued that he can accomplish just as much with analog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was released by Troma and features early roles by Billy Bob Thornton and Hal Sparks before they became famous. Former MTV veejay Martha Quinn also appears.\n\nThe film is about an all-female motorcycle gang named the \"Cycle Sluts\", who cruise into the isolated town of Zariah looking for a good time. Here, an evil scientist-turned-mortician has been killing local townspeople with the aid of his long-suffering dwarf assistant and turning them into zombies to use as labor at an abandoned mine. The mine is too radioactive after underground nuclear testing to be mined by living people. Although the scientist later admits that the real reason he has been doing it is not the money, but because he is just plain mean.\n\nThe zombies escape after a curious little boy removes the lock to explore the mine, becoming the zombies' first victim. Around this point, a bus-load of blind orphans become stranded just on the outskirts of town as their ride breaks down. Luckily their bus-driver always keeps an Uzi on the bus \"for sentimental reasons\".\n\nWith vague memories of life to guide them, the zombies eventually find their way back to town and begin devouring live flesh. Going against the wishes of their leader and despite some rough treatment from the locals earlier in the film, the Cycle Sluts ride to the rescue and begin killing the zombies using chainsaws, baseball bats, welding torches, a garrote and a staple gun.\n\nIn the final scene, the Cycle Sluts use fresh meat to lure the remaining zombies to the town church, which they have packed with dynamite. They are now aided by the doctor's dwarf who has decided that there are better lines of work than being a henchman. With all the undead inside and the church sealed up, the timer goes off and the church goes up in flames, zombies and all. The Cycle Sluts are rewarded with a sack full of cash and induct the dwarf and several of the blind orphans as honorary Cycle Sluts. They then ride out of town with some of the men folk in tow (their new \"bitches\") and throw the sack of money to the wind.\n\n\n\"Variety\" called it \"a surprisingly funny B-movie spoof with a feminist edge.\" Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Although Mr. Hoskins's screenplay has a few amusing jokes, the movie is seriously deficient in visual and verbal energy.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"It's a deliciously trashy title, and thankfully it's not been wasted: This is a diverting piece of deliberate schlock with a healthy share of laughs that's just right for midnight-movie fare.\" Writing in \"The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia\", academic Peter Dendle said that though the film has funny moments, it is overall \"forced and overdone\".\n\n"}

Heikki Ritavuori is a unique figure in Finland's political history because he is not remembered for his life's work, but instead for its end. Minister Ritavuori was shot dead at the door to his home in Helsinki in February 1922.\n\nThe murder of a government minister is such a rare occurrence in Finland that it has almost completely overshadowed Ritavuori's achievements as a builder of Finnish society. The Turku-born lawyer, member of parliament and government minister was one of the most notable politicians in the early years of Finland's independence. He was dedicated to justice, equality among citizens, and a unified nation.\n\nDefending these values took a great deal of courage in the unstable times following the Finnish Civil War, when radical groups sought their own ends by any means necessary. Ritavuori was frightened of neither the extreme left-wing nor the extreme right, but instead implemented the reforms he felt were necessary as K.J. Ståhlberg's most trusted man. He took particular care in defending the civil rights of red prisoners of war kept in prison camps, and advocated laws to pardon them.\n\nRitavuori was already familiar with social questions when he became Secretary of the Foundation Board of the Parliament of Finland in 1907; he was especially interested in land-owning rights and the position of peasants. As a lawyer, he liked to handle communal cases in defense of the poor. He was elected as a member of the parliament from the Turku Province southern election circle first in 1913, and then again in 1919.\n\nThe acceptance of Finland's republican form of government in June 1919 is largely because of Ritavuori's work as chairman of the Foundation Board. The dispute about the form of government between the royalists and the republicans had been holding back governmental activity for months. To stop the unhelpful \"temporary situation\", the republican government of Kaarlo Castrén proposed a law establishing the new form to the Parliament of Finland in June; it was written by the President of the High Court, K.J. Ståhlberg.\n\nFor the parliament to be able to accept the proposed law, it had to be classified as urgent by the meeting order. One vote more was needed for the required five-sixths majority, and so the reform of the government was about to be delayed again. It was then that Heikki Ritavuori involved himself in the matter, and only a couple of days later he gave his own proposal for a new governmental form (which he had already submitted for consideration earlier) to the parliament. The members of the parliament were amazed, but now the proposal was classified as urgent, and based on it, the parliament accepted the new form of government on 21 June 1919. Thus, Finland became a republic.\n\nRitavuori, having served as Minister of Internal Affairs twice, was frequently confronted by activists representing the extreme right-wing. Because of the laws to pardon red prisoners of war, he was branded the \"red minister\", one who threatened the legacy of white Finland. Supporting Ståhlberg as the opponent of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim in the presidential elections in summer 1919 and opposing the independence of the protection guards in the crisis of 1921 made Ritavuori even less liked in right-wing circles.\n\nRitavuori's fate was sealed by the Eastern Karelia crisis in the winter of 1921–22, when he served as minister responsible for the border guard and handled his job in a direct manner as instructed by President of Finland K.J. Ståhlberg. Based on falsified news sent from Eastern Karelia, right-wing newspapers started a smear campaign that destroyed Ritavuori's reputation and eventually caused his death. Heikki Ritavuori was shot dead at his home in Etu-Töölö, at Nervanderinkatu 11, on 14 February 1922.\n\nErnst Tandefelt, who had fired the murder weapon, was a mentally underdeveloped black sheep of a noble family. He stated that based on newspaper reports, and particularly \"Hufvudstadsbladet\" information supporting Swedish-speaking activists, he had concluded that Ritavuori was indeed a danger to the country, and thought he had to be eliminated. In court, Tandefelt said he had acted alone, and he was sentenced to 12 years of hard labor as partially legally insane. Afterwards, Tandefelt implicated several people, including the pharmacist Oskar Jansson and the general-major Paul von Gerich, who he said were involved in planning the murder. Research done by the chancellor of justice in 1927-30 did not result in any evidence that would have caused further actions in the matter. The decision was an understandable solution in the increasingly right-wing atmosphere of the time. However, many facts pointed to the theory that the initiative-less Tandefelt was supported by, if not a full conspiracy, then at least radical political actors, mostly Finland-Swedish Civil Guard activists, who encouraged Tandefelt to kill Ritavuori by giving him the murder weapon and some money.\n\nHeikki Ritavuori, only 41 years old at the time of his death, was a heavy-duty government figure whom several parties saw as a potential new president.\n\nHeikki Ritavuori fennicised his name in 1906. His younger brother Eero Rydman was a member of parliament from the Progressive Party, the mayor of Helsinki for 12 years, and a presidential candidate of the People's Party of Finland in 1956. Ritavuori's grandson, professor Pekka Tarjanne, was the chairman of the Liberal People's Party, a member of the parliament, a government minister, chairman of the board of the Post and Telephone Bureau, and chairman of the board of the ITU.\n\n"}

Close associate and friend of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, he opposed both the pacts with Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (Treaty of Hadziacz of 1658) and with Tsardom of Russia (Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654).\n\nBohun was born in Ukrainian-Ruthenian nobility family. He took part in the Khmelnytsky Uprising against Polish rule in Ukraine. In June 1651 he was elected colonel of troops of Bracław and took part in the Battle of Berestechko against Polish troops led by King John II Casimir, which the Cossacks lost. Surviving the defeat he regathered his forces and in June 1652 took part in the battle of Batih. In this instance the Cossacks were successful; the Polish commander Marcin Kalinowski was killed and the future hetman Stefan Czarniecki barely escaped with his life. The Polish defeat was complete and allowed the Cossack forces to start a successful offensive and effectively gain control over large parts of Ukraine. Until 1657 Ivan Bohun also led his forces in minor skirmishes against Polish forces, notably at Bratslav and Uman. He also fought against the Crimean Tatars who had switched sides in the effect of the Treaty of Zboriv of 1649 (they were initially allied with the Cossacks but supported the Commonwealth in later year). \nInitially Bohun opposed the Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654. After the Battle of Konotop, Ivan Bohun led an armed pro-Russian uprising against his former ally Ivan Vyhovsky near Konotop and defeated his army in the autumn of 1659. \n\nAfter being captured by the Poles in 1663, Bohun was offered freedom in exchange for taking part in a new military campaign against the Tsardom of Russia. During the retreat after the disastrous Siege of Hlukhiv Bohun was executed by a firing squad for handing over important military information to the besieged Russian garrison.\n\nIvan Bohun became a popular Ukrainian folk hero, immortalized by Henryk Sienkiewicz in a novel \"With Fire and Sword\" where character Jurko Bohun was loosely based on him. In the film based on the novel, directed by Jerzy Hoffman, Bohun was played by Aleksandr Domogarov.\n\nIvan Bohun is also well described in \"Bohun\", a modern, historical novel about Polish-Cossack wars, written by Jacek Komuda.\n\nHis death is still commemorated annually in Lviv.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2077595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077595", "title": "Brainpool (band)", "text": "Brainpool (band)\n\nBrainpool is a pop music group from Lund, Sweden. The band was most popular in the mid-1990s, mostly in the Swedish indie-pop scene together with other bands like Eggstone or Beagle.\n\nThis Swedish band was formed in Lund, Scania, and the original members were vocalist Jan \"Janne\" Kask, guitarist David Birde, bassist Christoffer Lundquist, and drummer Jens Jansson. The band signed to Per Gessle's music publishing company Jimmy Fun Music and released three albums: \"Soda\" (1994; Swedish Grammy as New Band), \"Painkiller\" (1995) and \"Stay Free\" (1996). They took part as support act during the \"European Crash! Boom! Bang!\" Tour by Roxette in 1994. \n\nJanne Kask left the band in 1997 to pursue a solo career. For a while the other band members were looking for a new lead singer, but soon gave up. \"It didn't take long for us to realize that it would be impossible to let another person join\", David Birde explained in an interview to The Daily Roxette. \"It would have to be the three of us, or split up. At first we thought about changing our name, but that turned out to be difficult - Sony Music had already paid for the recording of \"You Are Here\" and they wanted us to keep the name. We had to choose between ditching the recordings and lose our record deal or go on calling ourselves Brainpool. We cowardly chose the latter.\"\n\nThe band not only decided to stay together after Kask left, but they decided to change their style and their music. \"We realized our audience was getting younger. We were 26, we were smelly and unshaven and drunk. There were 11- and 12-year-old fans who wanted a hug, we just thought it was so wrong, that's when we realized we had to do something else,\" says David. It was time for their music to reach the level of maturity that they were at.\n\n\"You Are Here\" was released in 1999. After this release, the band worked for 4 years on a rock opera which was finally released in 2004 with the name \"Junk\" and with the topic of anti-consumerism. The premiere was in Malmö on August 19, 2004 where the band was backed up by Malmö Symphony Orchestra. The album was published by the band's own publishing company Junk Musik which releases singles only on the Internet.\n\nIn 2005, Brainpool released the compilation \"We Aimed To Please\". The album only contains songs from 1992 to 1997 when Janne Kask was still in the band. There are no songs from \"You Are Here\" or \"Junk\".\n\nIn May 2007 Brainpool's \"Junk: A Rock Opera\" premiered at a small venue in Los Angeles to mixed fan reviews. It sold out 36 shows, and, in the beginning of 2009, was performed as a staged reading off-Broadway in New York City. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2077621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077621", "title": "WSAN", "text": "WSAN\n\nWSAN (1470 kHz, \"iHeartPodcast AM 1470\") is a commercial AM radio station licensed Allentown, Pennsylvania. It is owned by iHeartMedia and serves the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton radio market.\n\nWSAN broadcasts a talk radio format drawing exclusively from iHeartRadio podcasts. Its studios and offices are in the iHeart Broadcasting Center in Whitehall Township and the transmitter is near the Whitehall Mall. It operates with 5,000 watts, non-directional by day but using a directional antenna at night.\n\nWSAN serves as the Lehigh Valley affiliate for Philadelphia Phillies radio broadcasts. Most hours begin with world and national news from NBC Radio News and local news from the WAEB news staff.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on May 24, 1923. Two separately owned stations shared time originally on AM 1440 in Allentown, WCBA and WSAN. Eventually, Lehigh Valley Broadcasting, owner of WSAN, bought out WCBA, giving WSAN the ability to broadcast around the clock. (For a time it used both call signs, \"WSAN-WCBA\" but eventually dropped WCBA from its station identification.) WSAN was owned by the Musselmann Family for decades, from its founding until 1992.\n\nIn the 1941, with the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) going into effect, WSAN switched to its current spot on the dial at 1470 kHz. But it was only powered at 500 watts. It was granted an increase to its current 5,000 watts in the late 1940s. In 1947, it added an FM station at 99.9 MHz, WSAN-FM. But in the late 1950s, it sold the station to \"The Easton Express\" newspaper, which moved its 98.3 WEEX-FM, powered at only 1,000 watts, over to 99.9, where it could increase its power to 16,000 watts. (Today, the 99.9 frequency is occupied by WODE-FM in Easton.)\n\n\"Assabe and Sabina\", a popular Pennsylvania German dialect radio program, was broadcast on WSAN from 1944 to 1955. Through the 1930s, 40s and 50s, WSAN was an NBC Red Network affiliate, airing its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \"Golden Age of Radio.\" As network programming moved from radio to television, WSAN began airing a full service middle of the road (MOR) format of music, talk and information, in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nThe station made a bold move in the 1970s. Through most of the decade, WSAN was a rare progressive rock outlet on the AM dial, even though the format was found mostly on FM stations, which could play the music in stereophonic sound. (The only other AM progressive station was KSAN in San Francisco. It was a coincidence the two stations had similar call letters.)\n\nAt the time, four of the five FM stations in Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton were running automated easy listening or beautiful music formats, and the fifth was automated adult contemporary. So with no rock stations serving the Lehigh Valley radio market, WSAN filled the void. In 1978, 95.1 WEZV (now WZZO) switched from easy listening to album rock, and WSAN's days as an AM rock station were numbered. \n\nBy the end of the 70s, WSAN switched to a pop and disco format. Then, as disco faded, WSAN flipped to country music, until about 1980. At that time, it changed to a big band/adult standards format called \"Unforgettable.\" WSAN played the hits of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, with a small amount of soft rock cuts from the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn 1983, still operating with the call letters WSAN, the station evolved into more of a popular MOR music format under the catchphrase \"Unforgettable II.\" It expanded to playing the soft hits of the 1950s through the 1980s. \n\nIn spring 1985, rival station WXKW 104.1 dropped country music for a soft adult contemporary sound as WAEB-FM. With no FM country station in the Lehigh Valley, WSAN returned to country music and took the call letters give up by FM 104.1. It became 1470 WXKW.\n\nIn 1992, Holt Broadcasting, which owned the local stations 95.1 WZZO and 1320 WKAP, purchased AM 1470. It maintained the country music format until 1993. 1470 WXKW then switched to a satellite oldies format when WKAP 1320 dropped it to return to easy listening. In 1996, Holt Broadcasting sold WZZO and 1470 WXKW to Capstar, which already owned WAEB and WAEB-FM. Holt kept 1320 AM, switched the station to a sports format and changed the call letters to WTKZ.\n\nWKAP began operation on 1320 AM in 1948. The station employed a popular music format for many years. It was owned by Rahall Communications. In the 1950s, it opted to play mostly non rock music and some softer songs by rock and roll artists. This format was known as MOR, or Middle of the Road. Throughout the 1960s, it had a top-40 format, combined with relatively apolitical call-in shows. By 1970, the station evolved to more of an adult contemporary format. In 1972, WKAP decided to compete with the two Top 40 stations in the Lehigh Valley, WAEB 790 AM, which played current music, and WEEX 1230 AM, which played oldies music. WKAP's adult top 40 format emulated West Coast giant KCBQ in San Diego. Some of the original WKAP DJs were Kevin Fennessy, Walt Brown, Shotgun Steve Kelly, Mark Stewart, Kris Bailey, Billy Sheridan, and J. Robert Taylor. The station was known as WKAP Radio 13. The station was sold to Gulf Broadcasting in the late 1970s.\n\nIn September 1978, a local club DJ by the name of Mike Jacobs came up with an idea of broadcasting an entire evening of live music, commercial-free, from a local night club. The facility to be used was \"The Castle Garden Ballroom\" located in Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown. The park's owners were Robert Plarr and Robert Ott. After extensive renovations, Castle Garden was opened in the fall of 1978. Crowds averaged about 300-450 per night, but the ballroom capacity was 2,000, so the owners and management were looking for a spark to drive the venue to bigger and better crowds. At the time, the radio station was an independent local AM station. The PD, Chris Bailey, the station manager Jerry Duckett, and the staff were very interested in the project, as it could help them in competition with their cross-town nemesis WAEB 790AM and add a possible ratings boost.\n\nThe idea was refined, and in January 1979, \"Studio 13\" debuted. It was broadcast Saturdays from 9:00 PM – 2:00 AM with DJ Mike Jacobs as the DJ/Host/MC. Bill Sheridan (now employed by Nassau Broadcasting) was the board technician. Pepsi-Cola came on board as the primary sponsor for the show. The station would insert voice-only commercials over the instrumental breaks in the music. The show opened with the Parliament's \"Shit, Goddamn, Get Off Your Ass & Jam,\" followed by Bell & James' \"Livin It Up\". This resulted in an FCC Warning to the station that made the local news. The crowd was 600 people the first night. With the news coverage and word of mouth, Studio 13 averaged 2,000 people per night and could have done more had there not been a Fire Marshall's limit on the number of people.\n\nWKAP realized a ratings jump from 3.8 to 23.4 Saturday evenings from 9:00PM to midnight in a one- month period and maintained this throughout the summer, until the show's conclusion on Labor Day of 1979.\n\nThe management of Castle Garden invested in and shot a one-hour video pilot entitled \"Castle Garden\" that it attempted unsuccessfully to syndicate.\n\nIn the fall of 1979, at the Annual Billboard Disco Forum and Convention in New York City, Mike Jacobs received an honorable mention as \"DJ of the Year\" for the Philadelphia region and was invited to spin at the Roseland Ballroom during the convention. WKAP also fared well, being nominated for \"Most Innovative Breakout Radio Show\" for the year 1979, but lost out to WCAU-FM in Philadelphia.\n\nMike Jacobs continued in radio and clubs in the area, working at Sunny 1100 WGPA and 96.1 WLEV-FM until his retirement in 1997. Some of the other WKAP on-air personalities moved on to other outlets, such as Bill Sheridan to WKRZ in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania and 99 \"The Hawk\" WODE-FM in Easton, Pennsylvania, and Kris Bailey to AM 790 WAEB.\n\nBy 1980, WKAP evolved into more of an adult contemporary music format. At the end of the Summer 1982, WKAP changed to an adult standards format, which was known as \"Music of Your Life\". The station featured easy listening vocalists from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, as well as big band music from the 1930s and 1940s. The station played a limited amount of non-rock songs from the 1970s.\n\nThe station stayed with this format through the 1980s. In 1984, Gulf Broadcasting sold WKAP to Holt Broadcasting, which at the time also owned WZZO. WKAP stayed with its standards music format, but added a bit more baby-boomer pop (songs by artists like Elvis Presley and The Beatles). In 1990, WKAP switched to a satellite-delivered oldies music format, playing mostly songs from 1964-1969 with some 1955-64 songs and a few 1970-73 songs mixed in. They continued with this format until 1992, at which time they returned to adult standards. This featured non-rock music as well as some soft rock music of the 1950s and 1960s, along with a small amount of 1940s hits and some soft hits form the 1970s. It was more of an easy listening based format than \"Music Of Your Life\". Their decision to abandon oldies music in 1992 was due to 99.9 FM WODE's adopting the format in late 1991.\n\nIn 1992, Holt Broadcasting also bought 1470 WXKW, which remained a country music station for another year. In 1993, the station switched to a satellite oldies format when 1320 flipped back to standards. Then, in 1996, Holt Broadcasting sold all of their stations except for AM 1320, which they made a sports station. Eventually AM 1320 was sold to Nassau Broadcasting Partners and today simulcasts WEEX. Capstar, which already owned WAEB-AM and WAEB-FM, then purchased 1470 AM and WZZO. The WKAP intellectual unit then moved from AM 1320 to AM 1470.\n\n1470 WKAP used a Westwood One easy listening format, playing a blend of standards and soft oldies/adult contemporary songs. Capstar merged with Chancellor Media in 1999, making WKAP 1470 an AM/FM station. At the beginning of 2001, Clear Channel Communications merged with AM/FM. Federal regulations limited the number of Lehigh Valley stations Clear Channel could own. They opted to sell WEEX and WODE to Nassau Broadcasting Partners, and kept WAEB, WAEB-FM, WZZO, and WKAP.\n\nIn November 2001, a few days after Oldies 99.9 FM WODE switched to classic rock hits, WKAP switched back to playing oldies songs from 1955 to 1973. Many of the air staff on WKAP came from WODE when the formats of the two stations changed.\n\nThe station was popular, as it was the only oldies music station in the Lehigh Valley, with music from the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s. This format aired successfully for almost five years.\n\nThe WKAP call sign was used from 2006-2007 at an AM station in Reading, Pennsylvania, but was dropped for the previous call sign and format (WRAW).\n\nOn September 11, 2006, WKAP ended its oldies format and adopted a Christian talk and teaching format. With this change, the station took the call sign WYHM, a disambiguation of \"Hymm.\"\n\nThe station was still a commercial radio station rather than non-commercial like many Christian outlets. Though owned by Clear Channel Communications, the station was run similarly to how Salem Media runs its many Christian stations, including 560 WFIL in Philadelphia. Commercial blocks of time are sold to Christian religious leaders, to host shows and seek donations to their ministries.\n\nSome of the Christian programming included \"Focus On The Family\", \"Insight for Living\", \"Janet Parshall's America\", \"Adventures In Odyssey\", \"Turning Point\" and \"Back To The Bible\". Mornings were hosted by \"Doug & Kim\".\n\nIn March 2007, the short-lived experiment with the Christian Talk format ended. The call sign returned to WSAN and the station adopted a sports-talk format, affiliated with Fox Sports Radio. WSAN carries Phillies baseball nearly every evening from the beginning of April through the end of September. Syndicated personalities Mancow, Jim Rome and Phil Hendrie were carried on the station.\n\nIn a bow to its former existence as an oldies station, in the winter of 2007 WSAN dropped one of Fox Sports Radio's weekday morning programs in favor of a three-hour oldies music show.\n\nOn May 26, 2016, WSAN flipped from English-language sports to Spanish-language sports as \"ESPN Deportes Lehigh Valley\". The station continued to air English-language broadcasts of Philadelphia Phillies and Lehigh Valley Phantoms games.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the station dropped ESPN Deportes Radio and rebranded as \"iHeartPodcast AM 1470\". Its programming is now sourced primarily from podcast programs distributed by iHeartRadio (including HowStuffWorks podcasts such as \"Stuff You Should Know\"). WSAN continues to retain the local sports play-by-play rights it held before, including Philadelphia Phillies baseball.\n\n"}

A January 1966 article stated that the station had already secured an affiliation with the Spanish International Network and planned to begin broadcasts by Labor Day of that year. In May, after the FCC overhauled the UHF table of allocations, SLTA amended its application to specify channel 21, as well as a studio location at 16th Street and Buckeye Road in Phoenix. Plans also included the commissioning of a repeater to expand the station's coverage to include Tucson within a year of signing on.\nBy early 1967, the station had set a June sign-on date, and several other details had changed. KPAZ would instead build its studios as part of the expansion of the Tower Plaza shopping center, and it also announced plans to air a ticker-tape of Associated Press newswire during the daytime hours. The station would sign on the air September 16, 1967—Mexican Independence Day—as Arizona's first full-power UHF station. Channel 21's formal opening included dignitaries such as Governor Jack Williams, Senator Barry Goldwater and Phoenix mayor Milton H. Graham.\n\nKPAZ began its life as a bilingual independent station, with a mix of SIN-supplied entertainment programs (primarily from Mexico) in Spanish and news and sports programs in English; Thomson hoped to start four other stations like KPAZ nationwide. The station's Spanish-language programs also included \"Hoy en Phoenix\", the Valley's first Spanish-language television newscast, anchored by Ivo Luis Alonso, former senior Latin American editor for Voice of America.\n\nIn sports, KPAZ's primary draw was weekly bullfighting telecasts from Mexico, which were important enough to the station that a bull was incorporated into its logo but also made the new station a lightning rod for controversy. A handful of irate local residents accused the station of being run by Communists. KPAZ also aired English-language entertainment shows, including Arizona State Sun Devils football highlights, and the syndicated music program \"Upbeat\". The station also produced local and alternative programming. KRIZ DJ Tony Evans hosted a dance and music show on Fridays; a Saturday night talk show known as \"Basharoonie\", hosted by Jim Spero, appeared in early 1969.\n\nDespite its ambitious plans and counterprogramming, KPAZ made no headway against established independent KPHO-TV (channel 5). By early 1969, pressure from advertisers had resulted in the bullfighting being phased out of KPAZ's schedule. In August, less than two years after signing on, SLTA filed for bankruptcy, a lengthy process that lasted nearly two years for channel 21. One of the largest creditors was RCA Victor, from which KPAZ had bought broadcast equipment but never made more than the down payment. In October, a judge rejected channel 21's proposal for a trustee, instead naming Julius Altschul to the post. An interim investor in channel 21, the Scottsdale-based Music and Entertainment Co., made a $225,000 offer to buy the station, which RCA contested.\n\nOn June 3, 1970, federal bankruptcy referee Hugh Caldwell approved channel 21's sale to the Glad Tidings Church for $400,000, contingent on FCC approval. Compared to the purchase price, RCA was owed $160,000; Ampex, another equipment manufacturer, $85,000; and Valley National Bank was owed $30,000. Caldwell also ruled that the stockholders in SLTA were not eligible to receive a cent, saying KPAZ's bankruptcy had actually begun on May 31, 1969, before the bankruptcy filing in August. Glad Tidings had bought the station after the existing stations in town refused to give the church time on their air, raising funds through the sale of bonds.\n\nGlad Tidings, even though it did not yet have the license, immediately took an active hand in operating KPAZ, raising potential concerns about undue influence. Less than a month after the approval in bankruptcy court, general manager Lou Silverstein resigned after a year at channel 21, citing indications he had received from bankruptcy trustee Altschul that Glad Tidings \"wanted a manager who would work more closely with the church\". He was replaced by ex-KPHO general manager Gene Spry. The changes did not take long to follow, as channel 21 began adding religious programming on the weekends. By April 1971, even though the license had still not transferred to Glad Tidings, the station was signing off nightly with an image of Jesus Christ. It would not be until June that the FCC approved the transfer of the KPAZ-TV license, at which time Glad Tidings announced it had bought new color videotape equipment.\n\nTo continue to fund channel 21's operation, Glad Tidings broadcast periodic pledge drives. In October, the station staged an 11-day telethon titled \"Outreach '72\". That same month, Gene Spry resigned as general manager and was replaced by the Rev. V. O. Brassfield, the church's assistant pastor.\n\nKPAZ also continued to originate new local programming through the bankruptcy process. Children's show \"Mr. Adam's Animals\" featured trained chimpanzees. In 1971, station manager Keith Houser created \"Action Auction\". The live Saturday night program, allowed viewers to bid for products such as furniture, Native American jewelry and automobile supplies. However, the show was canceled after Spry resigned.\n\nDespite FCC approval, the sale to Glad Tidings met with continued opposition from KPAZ's largest creditor: RCA. The company filed at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to appeal the KPAZ reorganization plan, warning that the original applications filed by Glad Tidings were so inadequate that they forced the church to retain a communications lawyer. On the line was all of RCA's equipment in use at channel 21. The appeals court found in favor of RCA in March 1972, ruling that, under state law, the equipment it had sold still belonged to RCA and could be repossessed at any time. However, bankruptcy referee Caldwell allowed KPAZ to reach a separate deal with RCA as to its equipment, allowing it to continue to operate. The decision reduced the effective purchase price to $155,000. Filings in the case revealed that bankruptcy trustee Altschul had not been allowed to see KPAZ's financial records. At the same time, Maricopa County won a ruling ordering KPAZ to pay it $16,000 in back property taxes for 1970 and 1971.\nGlad Tidings continued to invest in KPAZ. On May 5, 1974, ground was broken for a new, two-story studio facility at the corner of 36th Street and McDowell Road in Phoenix. The facility, designed by architect James R. Abney, cost $1 million and opened in June 1975. The February 1975 Nielsen ratings showed KPAZ pulled more female viewers aged 25–40 for its broadcasts of \"The Real McCoys\" than those watching the \"CBS Evening News\". Additionally, channel 21 aired a package of Phoenix Giants minor league baseball games in the 1975 season.\n\nKPAZ-TV continued to lose money, with debts approaching $2 million, and as early as December 1975, potential suitors appeared. Trinity Broadcasting of Arizona, a subsidiary of a fledgling broadcast ministry known as the Trinity Broadcasting Network, filed to buy KPAZ from debt-ridden Glad Tidings, with plans to convert the station to entirely religious programming. Immediately, Trinity began buying air time on KPAZ at a rate of $10,000 a month, giving the station a vital lifeline. However, the deal collapsed on July 26 when Glad Tidings Church informed the FCC by telegram that it was terminating the deal, just one day before the commission was to take up the proposed sale. TBN founder Paul Crouch said that the church had apparently pulled out because TBN's purchase of airtime on KPAZ had ameliorated its financial situation to the point where the church sought to renegotiate the sale.\n\nOn January 19, 1977, RCA seized KPAZ's equipment for outstanding debts, forcing channel 21 to go dark. General manager Dale Allen Richman noted that the company \"simply came in and took what was rightfully theirs\". The next week, Euel and Cinderalla Ballentine, a couple who had bought $25,000 in Glad Tidings savings certificates promoted on the station, sued the church and 11 of its officers and directors, saying that they failed to disclose that Glad Tidings could not pay the interest on the certificates. General manager Richman defended channel 21, claiming that \"the devil is trying to strike down the Christian ministry of this television station\".\n\nWith KPAZ off the air, Trinity, still pursuing options to buy the station, was joined by the PTL Television Network, which began negotiating to buy KPAZ from Glad Tidings. At the time, PTL owned no television stations of its own. However, in March, TBN made another push to buy the station, asking KPAZ's bondholders to swap their Glad Tidings bonds for those of Trinity Broadcasting of Arizona. The Trinity acquisition was approved by the FCC on July 21, with the station returning to the air on Labor Day as its second station, after flagship KTBN-TV in Santa Ana, California. TBN also settled the lawsuit brought by the Ballentines for $27,500.\n\nIn 1979, TBN proposed adding a horizontal cross piece to KPAZ's South Mountain tower, which would have been lit to create a lighted cross; this was denied by the City of Phoenix parks department, which said that the towers on the mountain were already a \"necessary evil\" and that religious symbols did not belong on public property.\n\nKPAZ-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 21, on that date. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 20. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 21.\n\nThe station received UHF channel 20 as its digital television allocation in April 1997 and was granted a permit to begin constructing digital facilities in August 2001. Special Temporary Authority granted in October 2002 allowed the digital signal to sign on the air at a lower power level. KPAZ elected channel 20 for its post-transition facilities, allowing the station to build its final facilities right away, but construction was delayed due to a steep rise in local construction that left the Phoenix area with a shortage of workers to install the DTV antenna . In March 2007, the station began program testing and in February 2008, certified that it was operating its full-power post-transition facilities.\n\n\n"}

The station's service contour covers the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe station is owned by Cumulus Media, through licensee Radio License Holding CBC, LLC, and broadcasts a classic rock radio format, playing rock hits from the 1960s into the early 1990s. WODE-FM's transmitter, studios and offices are on Paxinosa Road West in Easton. The station is frequently at or near the top of the ratings in the Allentown-Easton-Bethlehem radio market.\n\nWODE-FM broadcasts using HD Radio, and simulcasts the sports programming of sister station 1230 AM WEEX on its HD2 subchannel.\n\nThe station began operations on 98.3 FM as a stand-alone FM station. It got its construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission in 1948, and signed on the air in June 1950. Its call letters stood for the \"Easton Express\", Easton's daily newspaper as well as the station's owner. WEEX-FM was originally powered at only 1,000 watts.\n\nIn the late 1950s, WSAN AM 1470 in nearby Allentown decided to give up its FM station on 99.9 MHz. The Easton Express took over the 99.9 frequency, boosting WEEX-FM's power to 16,000 watts. Also in the late 1950s, the newspaper put an AM station on the air at 1230 kHz under the WEEX call sign. In the early 1960s, WEEX 1230 switched to a Top 40 radio format during that time and used the FM station to simulcast much of the programming to cover areas where the AM station's 1,000 watt signal could not be heard.\n\nIn the late 1960s, WEEX-FM's simulcast with the AM was broken off under new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules which forbid full-time AM/FM simulcasts. The FM station switched to beautiful music under the WQQQ call sign. \n\nThe call letters were chosen because the lower-case Q closely resembled the number 9, hence the station's frequency 99.9. The station offered an instrumental-based easy listening format, playing cover versions of pop songs, as well as Broadway and Hollywood showtunes. A few times per hour a soft vocal was mixed in.\n\nIn late 1982, The Easton Express acquired \"The Globe-Times\", a newspaper in nearby Bethlehem. To satisfy the FCC's media ownership rules, both WQQQ and WEEX were sold off to Wilkes-Schwartz Broadcasting, so that the Easton Express would not own too many media outlets in the same market.\n\nOn April 4, 1983, WQQQ swapped formats with its AM sister station, WEEX 1230. WEEX had evolved by 1981 from Top 40 into an adult contemporary format. WEEX's disc jockeys moved to 99.9 FM. WQQQ's easy listening format was moved to 1230 WEEX but it played more vocals than it did on FM.\n\nThe former WEEX format was modified on FM into Mainstream CHR/Top 40. The station kept the WQQQ call sign but became known as \"Q 100.\" Initially, the station focused on current pop music, but also played a moderate amount of 60s and 70s oldies until about 1985. Throughout the 80s, WQQQ aired a Saturday evening oldies show. But by 1986, the regular rotation was mostly current and recent titles.\n\nAt the time, Q100 was the only Top 40/CHR station in the Allentown/Easton/Bethlehem radio market, competing with then-dominate Album Rock station 95.1 WZZO for first place in the ratings. However, on January 26, 1987, former country music outlet WXKW switched to CHR as \"Laser 104.1 WAEB-FM.\" While the change didn't have an immediate impact on Q100's ratings, a burnt-out transmission line in the summer of 1988 forced the station to broadcast on low-power for a period of 2 weeks. This caused Q100's ratings to slip, allowing WAEB-FM to beat Q100 in the ratings.\n\nIn 1989, Roth Broadcasting acquired WQQQ, and sister station WEEX from Wilkes-Schwartz. That September, Q100 switched to a dance-leaning CHR format as \"Hot 99.9\" under the WHXT call sign. The format lasted about a year before returning to Mainstream CHR.\n\nAfter an uphill ratings battle with its rival WAEB-FM for almost 2 years, Hot 99.9 was unable to make any significant gains due to budget and signal issues. However, in its final ratings trend as a CHR, WHXT had beaten WAEB-FM by two-tenths of a point.\n\nOn August 23, 1991, WHXT dropped its CHR format for oldies. The format played the hits of the 1950s, 1960s, and a few songs from the early 1970s. The call sign became WODE-FM (standing for OlDiEs) and the station became known as \"Oldies 99\" under programming consultant Pete Salant.\n\nThe station was sold to Patterson Broadcasting and became \"Oldies 99.9\" in the mid 1990s (adding the \"point nine\" in its handle as more radios employed digital tuners). In 1997, Capstar bought WODE-FM and WEEX as part of a multi-station deal, but spun the Easton stations off to Clear Channel Communications. Capstar had to do this because the Lehigh Valley has only five FM stations, and under FCC rules, no one company could own more than half. Capstar was already buying 95.1 WZZO and 104.1 WAEB-FM. Under Clear Channel ownership, WODE-FM continued its oldies format.\n\nIn 2000, Clear Channel announced a merger with AM/FM Broadcasters (a company which was created as a result of a merger with Capstar and Chancellor). AM/FM already owned WZZO and WAEB-FM. Clear Channel would not be allowed to keep all three stations upon the merger, so it decided to swap WODE-FM and WEEX with Nassau Broadcasting Partners. Nassau was given cash plus WODE-FM and WEEX, while Clear Channel obtained stations in New Jersey, including WNNJ, WNNJ-FM, WSUS, WHCY, and management agreements for WDLC and WTSX. Clear Channel also kept the former Capstar/AM-FM stations.\n\nIn September 2001, WODE-FM hit #1 in the Fall 2001 Arbitron ratings in the Allentown market. The station was originally called \"99-9 The River\" but was forced to change its name because Clear Channel owned the rights to the name \"The River.\" WODE-FM became known as \"99-9 The Hawk.\" Its slogan was \"The Valley's Classic Hits Station.\" The station's ratings generally led the market with the key 25-54 audience.\n\nWODE-FM, along with nine other Nassau stations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, was purchased at bankruptcy auction by NB Broadcasting in May 2012. NB Broadcasting was controlled by Nassau's creditors — Goldman Sachs, Pluss Enterprises, and P.E. Capital. WODE-FM was included in the deal after Goldman Sachs rejected a bid from Cumulus Media for the station. In November, NB Broadcasting filed a motion to assign its rights to the stations to Connoisseur Media. The sale to Connoisseur Media, at a price of $38.7 million, was consummated on May 29, 2013.\n\nWith the sale completed in July 2013, Connoisseur Media tweaked the format, giving it more of a rock focus and changing the slogan to \"Classic Rock of the 70s, 80s and More.\"\n\nIn late 2013, WODE-FM acquired translator W234AX 94.7 FM, licensed to serve Allentown, from Family Life Ministries. The translator broadcast WODE-FM analog/HD1 programming until April 15, 2016, when it began simulcasting the programming of alternative rock sister station 107.1 WWYY via WODE-FM-HD2.\n\nWODE-FM-HD2 programming (WEEX simulcast) is broadcast on the following translator:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2077667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077667", "title": "Knuckle-walking", "text": "Knuckle-walking\n\nKnuckle-walking is a form of quadrupedal walking in which the forelimbs hold the fingers in a partially flexed posture that allows body weight to press down on the ground through the knuckles. Gorillas and chimpanzees use this style of locomotion as do anteaters and platypuses.\n\nKnuckle-walking helps with actions other than locomotion on the ground. For the gorilla the fingers are used for the manipulation of food, and in chimpanzees for the manipulation of food and for climbing. In anteaters and pangolins, the fingers have large claws for opening the mounds of social insects. Platypus fingers have webbing that extend past the fingers to aid in swimming, thus knuckle-walking is used to prevent stumbling. Gorillas move around by knuckle-walking, although they sometimes walk bipedally for short distances while carrying food or in defensive situations. Mountain gorillas use knuckle-walking plus other parts of their hand—fist-walking does not use the knuckles, using the backs of their hand, and using their palms.\n\nAnthropologists once thought that the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans engaged in knuckle-walking, and humans evolved upright walking from knuckle-walking: a view thought to be supported by reanalysis of overlooked features on hominid fossils. Since then, scientists discovered \"Ardipithecus ramidus\", a human-like hominid descended from the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans. \"Ar. ramidus\" engaged in upright walking, but not knuckle-walking. This leads to the conclusion that chimpanzees evolved knuckle-walking after they split from humans six million years ago, and humans evolved upright walking without knuckle-walking. This would imply that knuckle-walking evolved independently in the African great apes, which would mean a homoplasic evolution of this locomotor behaviour in gorillas and chimpanzees. However, other studies have argued the opposite by pointing out that the differences in knuckle-walking between gorillas and chimpanzees can be explained by differences in positional behaviour, kinematics, and the biomechanics of weight-bearing.\n\nChimpanzees and gorillas engage in knuckle-walking. This form of hand-walking posture allows these tree climbers to use their hands for terrestrial locomotion while retaining long fingers for gripping and climbing. It may also allow small objects to be carried in the fingers while walking on all fours. This is the most common type of movement for gorillas, although they also practice bipedalism.\n\nTheir knuckle-walking involves flexing the tips of their fingers and carrying their body weight down on the dorsal surface of their middle phalanges. The outer fingers are held clear off the ground. The wrist is held in a stable, locked position during the support phase of knuckle-walking by means of strongly flexed interphalangeal joints, and extended metacarpophalangeal joints. The palm as a result is positioned perpendicular to the ground and in-line with the forearm. The wrist and elbow are extended throughout the last period in which the knuckle-walker's hand carried body weight.\n\nThere are differences between knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and gorillas: juvenile chimpanzees engage in less knuckle-walking than juvenile gorillas. Another difference is that the hand bones of gorillas lack key features that were once thought to limit the extension of the wrist during knuckle-walking in chimpanzees. For example, the ridges and concavities features of the capitate and hamate bones have been interpreted to enhance stability of weight-bearing; on this basis, they have been used to identify knuckle-walking in fossils. These are found in all chimpanzees but in only two out of five gorillas. They are also less prominent when found in gorillas. They are however found in primates that do not knuckle-walk.\n\nIt has been suggested that chimpanzee knuckle-walking and gorilla knuckle-walking are biomechanically and posturally distinct. Gorillas use a form of knuckle-walking which is \"columnar\". In this forelimb posture, the hand and wrist joints are aligned in a relatively straight, neutral posture. In contrast, chimpanzees use an extended wrist posture. These differences underlie the different characteristics of their hand bones.\n\nThe difference has been attributed to the greater locomotion of chimpanzees in trees, compared to gorillas. The former frequently engage in both knuckle-walking and palm-walking branches. As a result, to preserve their balance in trees, chimpanzees, like other primates in trees, often extended their wrists. This need has produced different wrist bone anatomy and, through this, a different form of knuckle-walking.\n\nKnuckle-walking has been reported in some baboons. It has also been suggested that fossils attributed to \"Australopithecus anamensis\" and \"Au. afarensis\" had specialized wrist morphology that was retained from an earlier knuckle-walking ancestor.\n\nGorillas use the form of walking on all fours with the fingers on the hands of the front two limbs folded inward. A gorilla's forearm and wrist bones lock together to be able to sustain the weight of the animal and create a strong supporting structure. Gorillas use this form of walking because their hips are attached differently than humans so standing on two legs for a long period of time would eventually become painful. Humans would have to walk on all fours as well if they had the same type of hip placement. Gorillas sometimes do walk upright in instances where dangers are present.\n\nGiant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Pangolins also sometimes walk on their knuckles. Another possible knuckle-walking taxon was the extinct chalicotheres, which looked something like a cross between a horse and a gorilla. The ground sloths may have also walked on their knuckles.\n\nKnuckle-walking tends to evolve when the fingers of the forelimb are specialized for tasks other than locomotion on the ground. In the gorilla the fingers are used for the manipulation of food, and in chimpanzees for the manipulation of food and for climbing. In anteaters and pangolins the fingers have large claws for opening the mounds of social insects. Platypus fingers have webbing that extend past the fingers to aid in swimming, thus knuckle-walking is used to prevent stumbling.\n\nIt has been argued that knuckle-walking of chimpanzees and gorillas originally started from fist-walking as found in orangutans. African apes most likely diverged from ancestral arboreal apes (similar to orangutans) who were adapted to distribute their weight among tree branches and forest canopies. Adjustments made for terrestrial locomotion early on may have involved fist-walking, later evolving into knuckle-walking.\n\nThere are competing hypotheses as to how knuckle-walking evolved as a form of locomotion, stemming from comparisons between African apes. High magnitudes of integration would indicate homoplasy of knuckle-walking in gorillas and chimpanzees, in which a trait is shared or similar between two species but is not derived from a common ancestor. However, results show that they are not characterized by such high magnitudes, which does not support independent evolution of knuckle-walking. Similarities between gorillas and chimpanzees have been suggested to support a common origin for knuckle-walking, such as manual pressure distribution when practicing this form of locomotion. On the other hand, their behavioral differences have been hypothesized to suggest convergent evolution, or homoplasy.\n\nAnother hypothesis proposes that African apes came from a bipedal ancestor, as there are no differences in hemoglobin between \"Pan\" and \"Homo\", suggesting that their divergence occurred relatively recently. Examining protein sequence changes suggests that \"Gorilla\" diverged before the clade \"Homo-Pan\", meaning that ancestral bipedalism would require parallel evolution of knuckle-walking in separate chimpanzee and gorilla radiations. The fact that chimpanzees practice both arboreal and knuckle-walking locomotion implies that knuckle-walking evolved from an arboreal ancestor as a solution for terrestrial travel, while still maintaining competent climbing skills.\n\nIt is important to note that not all features associated with knuckle-walking are identical to the beings who practice it, as it suggests possible developmental differences. For example, brachiation and suspension are almost certainly homologous between siamangs and gibbons, yet they differ substantially in the relative growth of their locomotor skeletons. Differences in carpal growth are not necessarily a consequence of their function, as it could be related to differences in body mass, growth, etc. It is important to keep this in mind when examining similarities and differences between African apes themselves, as well as knuckle-walkers and humans, when developing hypotheses on locomotive evolution.\n\nOne theory of the origins of human bipedality is that it evolved from a terrestrial knuckle-walking ancestor. This theory is opposed to the theory that such bipedalism arose from a more generalized arboreal ape ancestor. The terrestrial knuckle-walking theory argues that early hominin wrist and hand bones retain morphological evidence of early knuckle-walking. The argument is not that they were knuckle-walkers themselves but that it is an example of \"phylogenetic 'lag'\". \"The retention of knuckle-walking morphology in the earliest hominids indicates that bipedalism evolved from an ancestor already adapted for terrestrial locomotion. ... Pre-bipedal locomotion is probably best characterized as a repertoire consisting of terrestrial knuckle-walking, arboreal climbing and occasional suspensory activities, not unlike that observed in chimpanzees today\". See Vestigiality. Crucial to the knuckle-walking ancestor hypothesis is the role of the os centrale in the hominoid wrist, since the fusion of this bone with the scaphoid is among the clearest morphological synapomorphies of hominins and African apes. It has been shown that fused scaphoid-centrales display lower stress values during simulated knuckle-walking as compared to non-fused morphologies, hence supporting a biomechanical explanation for the fusion as a functional adaptation to this locomotor behavior. This suggests that this wrist morphology was probably retained from an last common ancestor that showed knuckle-walking as part of its locomotor repertoire and that was probably later exapted for other functions (e.g. to withstand the shear stress during power-grip positions). Nevertheless, it is relevant to keep in mind that extant knuckle-walkers display diverse positional behaviors, and that knuckle-walking does not preclude climbing or exclude the possible importance of arboreality in the evolution of bipedalism in the hominin lineage.\n\nIt has however been suggested that knuckle-walking evolved independently and separately in Pan and gorillas and so was not present in the human ancestors. This is supported by the evidence that gorillas and chimpanzees differ in their knuckle-walking related wrist anatomy and in the biomechanics of their knuckle-walking. Kivell and Schmitt note \"Features found in the hominin fossil record that have traditionally been associated with a broad definition of knuckle-walking are more likely reflecting the habitual Pan-like use of extended wrist postures that are particularly advantageous in an arboreal environment. This, in turn, suggests that human bipedality evolved from a more arboreal ancestor occupying a generalized locomotor and ecological niche common to all living apes\". Arguments for the independent evolution of knuckle-walking have not gone without criticism, however. A more recent study of morphological integration in human and great ape wrists suggests that knuckle-walking did not evolve independently in gorillas and chimpanzees, which \"places the emergence of hominins and the evolution of bipedalism in the context of a knuckle-walking background.\"\n\nPrimates can walk on their hands in other ways than on their knuckles. They can walk on fists such as orangutans. In this body weight is borne on the back of the proximal phalanges.\n\nQuadrupedal primate walking can be done on the palms. This occurs in many primates when walking on all fours on tree branches. It is also the method used by human infants when crawling on their knees or engaged in a \"bear-crawl\" (in which the legs are fully extended and weight is taken by the ankles). A few older children and some adults retain the ability to walk quadrupedally, even after acquiring bipedalism. A BBC2 and \"NOVA\" in \"The Family That Walks on All Fours\" reported on the Ulas family in which five individuals grew up walking normally upon the palms of their hands and fully extended legs due to a recessive genetic mutation that causes a non-progressive congenital cerebellar ataxia that impairs the balance needed for bipedality. Not only did they walk on their palms of their hands but could do so holding objects in their fingers.\n\nPrimates can also walk on their fingers. In olive baboons, rhesus macaques, and patas monkeys such finger walking turns to palm walking when animals start to run. This has been suggested to spread the forces better across the wrist bones to protect them.\n"}

A particle-beam weapon is a type of directed-energy weapon, which directs energy in a particular and focused direction using particles with minuscule mass. Some particle-beam weapons have potential practical applications, e.g. as an antiballistic missile defense system for the United States and its cancelled Strategic Defense Initiative. They have been known by myriad names: phasers, disruptors, particle accelerator guns, ion cannons, proton beams, lightning rays, rayguns, etc.\n\nThe concept of particle-beam weapons comes from sound scientific principles and experiments currently underway around the world. One effective process to cause damage to or destroy a target is to simply overheat it until it is no longer operational. However, after decades of R&D, particle-beam weapons are still very much at the research stage and it remains to be seen if or when they will be deployed as practical, high-performance military weapons.\n\nParticle accelerators are a well-developed technology used in scientific research for decades. They use electromagnetic fields to accelerate and direct charged particles along a predetermined path, and electrostatic \"lenses\" to focus these streams for collisions. The cathode ray tube in many twentieth-century televisions and computer monitors is a very simple type of particle accelerator. More powerful versions include synchrotrons and cyclotrons used in nuclear research. A particle-beam weapon is a weaponized version of this technology. It accelerates charged particles (in most cases electrons, positrons, protons, or ionized atoms, but very advanced versions can accelerate other particles such as mercury nuclei to near-light speed and then shoots them at a target. These particles have tremendous kinetic energy which they impart to matter in the target, inducing near-instantaneous and catastrophic superheating at the surface, and when penetrating deeper, ionization effects which can be especially detrimental to electronics in the target. However, high-power accelerators are extremely massive (sometimes in the order of kilometers, like the LHC), with highly constricted construction, operation and maintenance requirements, and thus unable to be weaponized using present or near-future technologies.\n\nCharged particle beams diverge rapidly due to mutual repulsion, so neutral particle beams are more commonly proposed. A neutral-particle-beam weapon ionizes atoms by either stripping an electron off of each atom, or by allowing each atom to capture an extra electron. The charged particles are then accelerated, and neutralized again by adding or removing electrons afterwards.\n\n\"Cyclotron particle accelerators\", \"linear particle accelerators\", and \"Synchrotron particle accelerators\" can accelerate positively charged hydrogen ions until their velocity approaches the speed of light, and each individual ion has a kinetic energy range of 100 MeV to 1000 MeV or more. Then the resulting high energy protons can capture electrons from electron emitter electrodes, and be thus electrically neutralized. This creates an electrically neutral beam of high energy hydrogen atoms, that can proceed in a straight line at near the speed of light to smash into its target and damage it.\n\nThe pulsed particle beam emitted by such a weapon may contain 1 gigajoule of kinetic energy or more. The speed of a beam approaching that of light (299,792,458 m/s in a vacuum) in combination with the energy created by the weapon was thought to negate any realistic means of defending a target against the beam. Target hardening through shielding or materials selection was thought to be impractical or ineffective in 1984, especially if the beam could be maintained at full power and precisely focused on the target.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Strategic Defense Initiative put into development the technology of a neutral particle beam to be used as a weapon in outer space. Neutral beam accelerator technology was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. A prototype neutral hydrogen beam weapon was launched aboard a suborbital sounding rocket from White Sands Missile Range in July 1989 as part of the Beam Experiments Aboard Rocket (BEAR) project. It reached a maximum altitude of 124 miles, and successfully operated in space for 4 minutes before returning to earth intact. In 2006, the recovered experimental device was transferred from Los Alamos to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.\n\n\n"}

The station is currently owned by Beasley Media Group. WRIF is a grandfathered FM station, Under current U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) limits for Class B stations, WRIF would be allowed to broadcast an effective radiated power (ERP) of at most 16,000 watts using an antenna 268 meters high. The station transmitter is in the Detroit suburb of Southfield near the intersection of 10 Mile Road and Northwestern Highway, and transmits its signal from the same tower as WXYZ-TV. WRIF's studios are in Ferndale.\n\n101.1 FM signed on in 1948 as WXYZ-FM. For most of the station's early years, the station was simply a simulcast of WXYZ AM 1270 (now WXYT AM). That changed in 1966, when the FCC decreed separate programming for at least half of the broadcast day on FM stations that had been simulcasts of their AM sisters. WXYZ-FM separated programming and aired first a MOR/adult standards format, then later went to a rock-based Top 40 approach called \"Boss 101,\" which featured mostly harder rock hits with little to no pop or soul product. Then in 1970, the station's then-owner, ABC made WXYZ-FM an affiliate of the \"Love\" network, a nationally syndicated underground rock format from ABC that predated today's satellite-fed radio formats (another \"Love\" affiliate was sister WLS-FM in Chicago). WXYZ-FM hired at least one local jock for this format - Arthur Penhallow.\n\nOn February 14, 1971, the station changed its call letters to WRIF. ABC had applied for WDAI (for Detroit Auto Industry) for WXYZ-FM, but the FCC assigned those to WLS-FM instead. The WRIF calls had been requested for WABC-FM in New York.\n\nUnder the aegis of consultant Lee Abrams, WRIF was a pioneer in the album-oriented rock format, utilizing many elements of progressive rock radio while maintaining a tight, Top-40 style play list. Other ABC stations with a similar sound included WPLJ in New York and WDVE in Pittsburgh. WRIF was not a pure rocker in its early years - you could hear such artists as KC & The Sunshine Band and the Bee Gees alongside Alice Cooper, Traffic, and the Allman Brothers. After 1975, WRIF dropped most of the pop artists to concentrate on rock, but they would play a pop or disco song if it were extremely popular. \"Stayin' Alive,\" for example, got many spins on WRIF in 1977-78.\n\nThe 1980s was probably the decade in which there was the most change in the Detroit radio dial. Among other changes, a new rocker was installed on 98.7 FM, WLLZ \"Detroits Wheels\", and it proved so popular that it took out two other Detroit rock stations. WWWW went country in 1980, and WABX changed to a Contemporary Hit Radio (CHR) format called \"Hot Rock\" in 1983, and then went adult contemporary as WCLS. But WRIF soldiered on, even though it was sold twice in the 1980s and its rock format was on the chopping block more than once (rumors persisted in the late 1980s that the station was to switch to an urban contemporary format, especially after the debut of classic rock WCSX in 1987). In May 2006, WRIF outlasted yet another rock station but with a twist. 106.7 \"The Drive\" switched to country (this time as \"106.7 The Fox\") just as it did back in 1980 when it was known as \"W4\". WRIF was 1 out of the 4 radio stations (along with WMXD, WMUZ and WJZZ) in the Barden, MI area that was used on Barden Cablevision's character generated line-up throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe station served as a backdrop for the Kevin Costner film \"The Upside of Anger\".\n\nABC continued to own WRIF until its merger with Capital Cities Communications in 1986. At that time, the station was spun off to Silver Star Communications. The next year, WRIF was sold to Great American Broadcasting (the former Taft Television and Radio, Inc.). Great American Broadcasting declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1993, and subsequently reorganized as Citicasters Communications.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the FCC began to permit one entity to own two stations on the same band in the same market for the first time. As a result, in 1994, Greater Media, who already owned Detroit's classic rocker WCSX, purchased WRIF from Citicasters.\n\nOn July 19, 2016, Beasley Media Group announced it would acquire Greater Media and its 21 stations (including WRIF) for $240 million. The FCC approved the sale on October 6, and the sale closed on November 1.\n\nIn 2007, the station was named \"Active Rock station of the year in a top 25 market award\" by Radio & Records magazine. Other nominees included WIYY in Baltimore, WAAF in Boston, KBPI in Denver, WMMR in Philadelphia, and KISW in Seattle.\n\nWRIF won the RadioContraband Rock Radio Award for \"Major Market Radio Station\" of the year in 2013 and 2014.\n\nWRIF was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nWRIF's HD Radio multicast signals are called: \n\nFrom the mid-1970s to 1979, the morning show had been hosted by Michael Collins. In 1979, WRIF began broadcasting \"J.J. and the Morning Crew\" which consisted of Jimmy \"J.J.\" Johnson, Lynne Woodison, and George Baier (better known as Richard T. Bruiser or Dick the Bruiser). In their prime, they were well known with doing news, weather, playing rock, and creating parody songs with their own versions of timeless rock hits such as Question Mark and the Mysterians' \"96 Tears\" with \"96 Beers\", The J. Geils Band's \"Freeze Frame\" with \"Beer Frame\", Sammy Hagar's \"I Can't Drive 55\" with \"I Can't Drive 25\", and their own version of Gary Numan's \"Cars\" with \"Bars\". The show is also known for lampooning NBC's longest running show, \"Meet the Press\" with \"Meet the Bruiser\". But despite WRIF's playing rock and disco songs, J.J. and the Morning Crew created \"D.R.E.A.D.\" which is short for \"Detroit Rockers Engaged In The Abolition of Disco\". J.J. and the Morning Crew left WRIF in the mid-1980s and moved their morning show to the now defunct WLLZ. (In the mid 1990s, J.J. and the Morning Crew moved to WRIF's soon to be sister station WCSX). J.J. now hosts middays at WOMC.\n\nIn November 1985, Joe Nipote (an actor, children's author and Detroit native) became WRIF's new morning show host. Never having worked with a partner before, Nipote was teamed up with then-midday host Ken Calvert. Within a year, Nipote and Calvert did very well ratings wise. However, after a year, Nipote left to return to Los Angeles, and returned to stand up and acting.\n\nIn 1991, WRIF hired a new morning team from Phoenix, Arizona - Drew & Zip. Zip left by 1994, and was replaced by local personality Mike Clark. Drew and Mike went on to become the #1 rated morning show in Detroit. In September 2007, Drew Lane left WRIF for an indefinite length of time to take care of his girlfriend who had been diagnosed with breast cancer. In April 2008, it was announced that Lane would not be returning to WRIF. The show was then renamed \"Mike In The Morning\" and was hosted by Clark and Marc Fellhauer, and features Trudi Daniels with the \"WRIF Rock & Roll Radio News,\" and Jamie Samuelsen on sports reports. On July 13, 2009, Lane returned to WRIF to once again team up with Mike Clark.\n\nThe show's name reverted to \"Drew and Mike in the Morning\", sometimes referred to as \"The Drew and Mike Show\", but is mostly just shortened to \"Drew and Mike\". Lane now does sports news for the show as well. Fellhauer, Daniels, and Mike Wolters still remain with the show. In May 2013, it was announced that Greater Media had not renewed the contract for Drew and Mike in the Morning, with the final Drew and Mike show airing on May 17. On May 28, Dave and Chuck \"The Freak\" of 89X took over morning drive. Since then, Trudi Daniels teamed up with WRIF alum Kenny \"K.C.\" Calvert to form \"The K.C. and Trudi Morning Show\" which made its debut on WCSX that summer, while Drew Lane moved to afternoons on sister station WMGC-FM in August 2013. Since his departure from terrestrial radio, Drew Lane has cobbled himself a nice living with podcasting.\n\nWRIF stickers are given out at many of the station's sponsored events. Many are unique to that event. Stickers have been made for bands including: Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne and OZZFEST, Mötley Crüe, ZZ Top, Alice Cooper, Kid Rock, Disturbed, YES, Journey, KISS, Santana, REO Speedwagon, Triumph, U2, Huey Lewis and the News, Loverboy, Aerosmith, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, Iggy Pop, Guns N' Roses, AC/DC, Korn, Linkin Park, Velvet Revolver, The Romantics and David Bowie. WRIF has also made stickers for appearances by comedians George Carlin & Rodney Dangerfield and the rock festival Lollapalooza. Stickers have also been made for non-concert events such as the Drew and Mike radio show, Harleyfest, legendary WRIF alum Arthur Penhallow and his famous saying \"Baby!\", as well as the major Detroit sports teams - the Detroit Pistons, Tigers, Red Wings, and Lions. Since nearly all of them are the same basic size and design (an oval with flat top and bottom with the same size border ring), they are highly collectable.\nSince 1971, over 700 different stickers have been made.\n\nDue to complaints of vandalism, WRIF has switched from stickers to window clings.\n\n"}

It is syndicated across the country by United Stations Radio Networks and internationally via Radio Express.\n\nTwenty featured songs from a particular month — alternating between 1970s and 1980s from week to week — are featured and played countdown-style, from No. 20 to No. 1. The \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart is the standard for this ranking.\n\n\"Dick Bartley's Classic Hits\" is based upon two previous oldies programs Bartley hosted, the countdown series \"Classic Countdown\" (previously known as \"American Gold\") and the live request series \"Rock and Roll's Greatest Hits\". In July 2017, the programs were combined, taking on its current name. The program is pre-recorded (\"Rock & Roll's Greatest Hits\", while live for most of its run, had transitioned to being pre-recorded shortly after joining United Stations).\n\nThough Bartley had hosted \"Rock & Roll's Greatest Hits\" since 1980 (a show that would be carried under various titles nationwide beginning in 1982, first with an earlier version of United Stations, then through the original Westwood One beginning in 1985), it was not until June 8, 1991, when he joined ABC Radio Networks, that he launched a countdown show. It was originally named American Gold. The concept of \"American Gold\" was loosely based upon the formats of other ABC shows, \"American Top 40\" and \"American Country Countdown\", except charts from a particular month or week from years' past were used. Differences between \"American Gold\" and the \"Classic Countdown\" were as follows:\n\n\nIn 2017, the new \"Classic Hits\" program used the \"American Gold\" format, only this time focusing on music of the 1970s and 1980s (with increasing early 1990s music included by the late 2010s).\n\nBartley announced his departure from ABC effective March 31, 2009. His last \"American Gold\" show, a 1975 Yearbook, was released to stations March 28, and relaunched the weekend of April 1 by the United Stations Radio Networks under its current name.

The year range during the mid-2010s was 1970-1987. As with \"American Gold\"'s countdowns of past years, Bartley would announce headlines, pop culture trends (such as styles, popular movies and TV shows, etc.) from that particular month.

These include \"Summer Classics\" (songs with the word \"summer\" or having summertime themes, aired Memorial Day weekend); \"Halloween Classics\" (the weekend nearest Oct. 31); \"Christmas and Holiday Favorites\" (the weekend nearest Dec. 25); and \"All-Time Greatest Hits\" (focusing on the biggest charting/\"A-list\" hits of the oldies/classic hits format's focus of the time, aired the weekend nearest Jan. 1).\n\nThe final episode, a countdown of the top hits of June 1984, was aired June 24, 2017; the new \"Dick Bartley's Classic Hits\" began airing a week later, with a dual spotlight on the hits of July 1976 and the Class of 1981. When the program ended, it was featuring songs that had not yet been recorded when the show began.\n\nIn addition to this national show, a local \"Sunday Night Countdown\" aired for several years on WCBS-FM. The WCBS version of the show featured two top-20 (or so) lists, one of which often matched the syndicated top-20 list and spotlighted a year from the 1970s, matching it with a corresponding 10 years later, although 1978 and 1979 were matched with 1968 and 1969, respectively. For example, if the first two hours are from January 1976, then the second two hours was from January 1986.\n\nThe WCBS version of the show ended on 28 September 2014.\n\n"}

It became an independent national university in 1970. Today, Makerere University is composed of nine colleges and one school offering programmes for about 36,000 undergraduates and 4,000 postgraduates.\n\n\"U.S. News & World Report\" has ranked Makerere University as the eighth best university in Africa and the 569th best university worldwide. The \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\" for 2016 ranked it as the fourth best university in Africa.\n\nMakerere University was alma mater to many post-independence African leaders, including Ugandan president Milton Obote and Tanzanian presidents Julius Nyerere and Benjamin Mkapa. The former president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Joseph Kabila, and Kenyan president Mwai Kibaki are also Makerere alumni.\n\nIn the years immediately after Uganda's independence, Makerere University was a focal point for the literary activity that was central to African nationalist culture. Many prominent writers, including Nuruddin Farah, Ali Mazrui, David Rubadiri, Okello Oculi, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, John Ruganda, Paul Theroux, V. S. Naipaul and Peter Nazareth, were at Makerere University at one point in their writing and academic careers.\n\nBecause of student unrest and faculty disenchantment, the university was closed three times between 2006 and 2016. The final time was on 1 November 2016 when President Yoweri Museveni declared it closed indefinitely. The university was reopened in January 2017.\n\nThe trade school that became Makerere University began operating in 1921 with the first classes in carpentry, building construction and mechanics. In 1922 it was founded as the \"Uganda Technical College\" with additional courses in the arts, education, agriculture and medicine. That same year it was again renamed as Makerere College. In 1928, the vocational classes were separated from the college and renamed Kampala Technical School. In 1937 the college began offering post-secondary education certificate courses.\n\nIn 1943, the British Protectorate government proposed the university, which led to a controversial struggle. It was described as \"a plot to steal African soil for European settlement,\" by the Bataka Party. In response to this campaign, there was rioting in the capital of Kampala.\n\nIn 1949 Makerere College was granted university status and its name became Makerere College, University of East Africa. In the same year, the Bataka Party had been banned by the British Protectorate government, because of acts of riot and arson committed after a Bataka protest gathering.\nThe university was closed three times between 2006 and 2016.\n\nBeginning on 1 August 2016, the non-teaching staff went on strike demanding their back pay. The strike lasted three weeks and the government agreed to pay them by the end of October; however, the government failed to do so. This was but one more broken promise in the cycle of failed promises, strikes and more promises. That strike was followed by a strike of the lecturers over unpaid incentive pay, and that strike was joined by students in solidarity. This led to President Yoweri Museveni closing the university \"indefinitely\". Additional protests, including from parents whose children were left hanging in mid-semester, led to Museveni appointing a special commission to try to rectify the situation but with no promises of reopening. The commission's report is due in late February 2017.\n\nThe University Council is the supreme governing body of the university while Senate is the chief academic organ of the University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of September 2015, the halls of residence at Makerere University included the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2010, the university announced the opening of two new campuses, one in the city of Fort Portal, approximately , by road, west of Kampala, and another one in the city of Jinja, approximately , by road, east of Kampala.

He also wrote theatre and radio screenplays and composed music. He was born in Kraków (then Krakau) under the Austrian rule during the foreign Partitions of Poland, to a family of Austrian origin that had been ennobled by Empress Maria Theresa.\n\nSchiller became famous for his 1934 staging of Adam Mickiewicz's \"Dziady\" at Warsaw's \"Teatr Polski\" (Polish Theatre). This was also presented in Lwów (now Lviv; 1932), Wilno (now Vilnius; 1933) as well as in Sofia in Bulgaria (1937).\n\nSchiller graduated from Kraków's Jagiellonian University in philosophy and Polish literature. He also studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. He debuted as a singer in Kraków's \"Zielony Balonik\" (Green Balloon) cabaret (1906) and as theater director in Warsaw's Polish Theatre (\"Teatr Polski\", 1917). He served as artistic director of the Ateneum Theatre (1932–34), raising its reputation as one of the leading voices for Poland's new intelligentsia in the interwar period. Schiller collaborated with the following Warsaw theatres:\n\nHe also collaborated with theaters in Łódź and Lwów (now Lviv). From 1930 to 1932, he was artistic and drama director of Warsaw's \"Wielki\" (Great), \"Rozmaitości\" (Variety), and \"Mały\" (Little) Theaters. In Lwów he developed his own concept of \"monumental theatre,\" pertaining to the production of great Romantic works: \"Kordian\" (1930), \"Dziady\" (Forefathers' Eve, 1932) and \"Sen Srebrny Salomei\" (Salomea's Silver Dream, 1932). Schiller's connection with Lwów lasted sporadically until 1939.\n\nHis directorial work included 29 dramas and some dozen vaudeville and operetta productions. In 1933 he headed the directorial department at the National Theater Arts Institute.\n\nOn 29 June 1908 Schiller initiated a correspondence with the English actor, theater director, scenic designer, and theoretician of drama, Edward Gordon Craig. Together with his letter Schiller sent Craig, in Florence, his essay, \"\"Dwa teatry\"\" (\"Two Theaters\"), translated into English by Madeline Meager. Craig responded immediately, accepting the essay for his international theater magazine, \"The Mask\". This was the beginning of a productive collaboration between the two prominent theater directors, who introduced each other's theoretical writings to foreign readers.\n\nDuring World War II, as part of German repressive measures after the \"Volksdeutsch\" German-collaborator actor Igo Sym had been shot dead by the Polish underground (7 March 1941), Schiller was imprisoned at the Pawiak prison and at Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May 1941 he was ransomed by his sister, Anna Jackowska, with 12,000 złotys that she received for her jewelry.\n\nAfter World War II, in 1946-49, Schiller was president of the National Drama School in Łódź (\"Państwowa Wyższa Szkoła Teatralna w Łodzi\"). In 1952 he founded the publication, \"Pamiętnik Teatralny\" (The Theater Memoir).\n\nHe died in 1954, aged 66, in Warsaw.\n\nEssays:\n\nPerformance scripts:\n\n\"Monumental\" productions:\n\n\"Zeittheater\" - productions on current social issues:\n\nMusicals:\n\n\n"}

Their meeting led to the establishment of a kindergarten for their infants. The school opened on 6 February 1952 with twelve pupils at Ffulu's home. Within two years, the student population had grown to over 150.\n\nThe kindergarten grew into a primary (elementary) school. Over the years, the school grew into a junior secondary (middle) school and a senior secondary (high) school. In 1969, the school became a vocational school. In 1974, the name of the school was changed to the Nkumba College of Commerce and Advanced Studies. Finally in 1994, the board of trustees were approved by the Ministry of Education to transform the college into a university. This marked the beginning of Nkumba University.

The first novel in the series was also made into a film for television in 1981. It starred Bernard Cribbins and was scripted by Leslie Thomas. \n\nDavies is a low-ranked CID (mentioned as a detective constable at least once) officer in the London borough of Willesden. He is nicknamed \"Dangerous\" ironically because he is said to be harmless. His real first name is never revealed. In the novels and TV series he is called \"The Last Detective\" from his superior's assessment of him as \"the last detective, since he was never dispatched on any assignment unless it was very risky or there was no one else to send\". Despite this, Davies is by no means a poor detective, and although he can take longer than his colleagues, and is dogged by bad luck, he does usually \"get his man\" in the end. \n\nThe first story had him drifting into the years-old unsolved case of the disappearance of Celia Norris, a local girl with a dark side. With his friend, the perpetually unemployed and well-read Mod Lewis (he spends all his time at the library to save on heating) he tracks down the culprit, collecting plenty of cuts, bumps and bruises along the way at the hands of the local thugs. At one point he is \"binned\" — an empty dustbin is placed over his head, pinning his arms, and the outside is then hit with pickaxe handles.\n\nBernard Cribbins played Davies in the first television version of this story, made in 1981.

The building was designed by John Horton and consists of a centre bay, emphasised by a segmental parapet, which contains trophies by William Hollins. A Jacobean-style gateway was added in 1883. It is a grade II* listed building.\n\nThe Proof House was established in 1813 by an act of Parliament at the request—and expense—of the then prosperous Birmingham Gun Trade. Its remit was to provide a testing and certification service for firearms in order to prove their quality of construction, particularly in terms of the resistance of barrels to explosion under firing conditions. Such testing prior to sale or transfer of firearms is made mandatory by the Gun Barrel Proof Act of 1868, which made it an offence to sell, offer for sale, transfer, export or pawn an unproofed firearm, with certain exceptions for military organisations. \n\nThe Proof process is that of testing a firearm for integrity using a severely overcharged cartridge, or \"Proof load\" which is fired through the gun in an armoured testing chamber. This exposes it to pressures far beyond what it would experience in normal service. It is awarded a stamped Proof Mark if it survives without either being destroyed or suffering damage from the proof load. Larger guns were tested at a shooting range in Bordesley along a railway viaduct; however, the expansion of the city centre resulted in the closure of the shooting range.\n\nProof may be rendered invalid if the firearm is damaged or modified significantly; at this point it is described as \"out of proof\" and must be re-proofed before it can be sold or transferred. Note that the correct term for a satisfactorily tested firearm is \"Proofed\", and not \"Proven\".\n\nThere are penalties for non-compliance with proof laws; a fine of £5,000 may be levied for selling an unproofed or out-of proof firearm, more if a number of firearms are involved in a transaction. Tampering with, or forging, a proof mark is regarded as even more serious.\n\nThe Proof House still exists today, largely unchanged in both purpose and construction, although it offers a wider range of services including ammunition testing and firearm accident investigation. The building contains a museum of arms and ammunition, and can be visited by prior arrangement. \n\n\n"}

Management contracts involve not just selling a method of doing things (as with franchising or licensing) but involve actually doing them. A management contract can involve a wide range of functions, such as technical operation and of a production facility, management of personnel, accounting, marketing services and training.\n\nIn Asia, many hotels operate under management contract arrangements, as they can more easily obtain economies of scale, a global reservation systems, brand recognition etc. It is not unusual for contracts to be signed for 30 years, and having a fee as high as 3.5% of total revenues and 6-10% of gross operating profit. \nManagement contracts have been used to a wide extent in the airline industry, and when foreign government action restricts other entry methods. Management contracts are often formed where there is a lack of local skills to run a project. It is an alternative to foreign direct investment as it does not involve as high risk and can yield higher returns for the company.\nThe first recorded management contract was initiated by Qantas and Duncan Upton in 1978.\n\nIn business management, franchising is a contractual relationship between franchiser (owner of the company) and franchisee (buyer of a brand name). The franchiser allows the franchisee to use its trademark along with certain business systems and processes in exchange for a fee.\n\nBusiness students usually get confused between the concepts of management contracts and franchising. Although they have much in common, such as they both earn by selling intangibles and are both affiliated with another company, but where a management contract acts as a framework and provides formation and structure to the company and its members, franchisee remains an independent businessman.\n\nA businessman who owns several companies, cannot distribute his attention amongst every minute detail of his companies. He needs some expert assistance with his work so he can concentrate on more broader aspects. This assistance can be provided by the contract management companies. On hiring such companies, the owner will have more time to concentrate on the expansion of the business rather than day-to-day working of the companies. The businessman can distribute some of his basic responsibilities to these management companies such as recruitment, deployment and retention.\n\nThere are several companies who cannot reach the peak of success due to lack of expertise in one field or another. Such companies should hire contract management teams. This way they would not just be hiring an experienced employee but an entire team of efficient and experienced employees in technical fields of management, accountancy, marketing etc.\n\nManagement contracts gives businessman an assurance of the continuity of his business. This can be illustrated through an example. A manager or any employee may terminate his job, leaving the business a hole in its team for the smooth functioning of the operations. A contract management company can easily change few employees without stirring the constancy of the business model.\n\nThrough management contracts, a businessman can venture international business opportunities without taking a huge risk of putting his own physical assets at stake. For example, the Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited of Britain retains general airport management skills. In the EEUU Heathrow serves the Indianapolis Airport under a 10 years management contract. It also provides retail management at the air mall in the Pittsburgh Airport.\n\nGovernment uses management contracts for the progress and development of the skill of the local managers and workers. They also accolade management contract companies to upgrade and operate public utilities.\n\nEntering into a management contracts might lead to difficulties and problems for the business owners. By entering into such agreements businesses are risking their privacy. When a businessman handover his company’s management to a third party, he may enter into confidential disputes. These contracts makes the business expose to ethical breaches, fraud and public exposer. The information of the other contracts made by the business is also available to the management contract companies. Since there responsibilities ranges from price negotiation to stock control they have full information about the vendors. Management responsibilities includes record of all employees, their personal information and payments procedures. Management contract companies have the information of the business finance also. This puts the business in a vulnerable position.\n\nHiring an outside contractor makes it difficult for the business to foresee the number of conflicts that can occur. For example, businessman hires a contract management company for the operations of the company. The management company may in turn take on the management of the supplier’s company too.

The base of this relationship is that the operator handles the day-to-day working of the hotel and takes up all the additional responsibilities such as maintenance, front office, housekeeping, handling food and beverages and sale. The management contract company has the power to recruit and fire the employees. The owner will authorize and pay for the capital project of the hotel but the responsibility of it is assigned to the operator.\nThe hotel management contracts can be lengthy and complicated. The negotiation of this agreement focusing the power of the owner and the rights of the operator. The initial draft is offered by the prospective operator. It usually is in favor of the operator so that operator can seek a long term contract.

The same legend also tells the origin of Tapulon, the local traditional dish, created with the poor ingredients that the group had at its disposal: the meat of the only donkey who carried their luggage, wine and little else.\n\nThe first historical name of Borgomanero is Burgus sancti Leonardi (i.e. Hamlet of Saint Leonard). This name derives from Saint Leonard's church, the most ancient monument in town, which presumably dates back to 1125-1150. From the \"paper of Romagnano\" of 1198, we learn that Burgus sancti Leonardi already enjoyed the status of a free village at the time.\n\nThe toponym Borgomanero is attributed to Jacob Mainerio (Jacobus de Mayneriis), who was mayor of Novara between 1193 and 1194. Mainerio decided to transform Burgus sancti Leonardi into a military stronghold between the Sesia river and Ticino river, and gave his name to the new military camp (Burgus Maynerium), replacing that of Burgus sancti Leonardi. The construction of the new walled village almost certainly implied dismantling the previous hamlet dedicated to Saint Leonard, and the old church remained outside the walls, perhaps as a cemetery church. The new village was redesigned on the model of the Roman civitas, with two main streets crossing each other at the centre, and side streets creating a regular network of intersections: a pattern that still characterises the historic city centre.\n\nThe village continued to grow in importance and resisted several sieges in the war between Visconti and Paleologi in the 1300s. Borgomanero lost autonomy when the Dukes of Milan granted it in fief first to the Tornielli family (1412 - 1447) and later to the Trivulzio family (1466 - 1548).\n\nIn 1449, Borgomanero and its surroundings were the locations of the clash between Louis, Duke of Savoy and Francesco I Sforza, which culminated in the Battle of Borgomanero, won by the Lombard troops led by Bartolomeo Colleoni.\n\nLater Borgomanero became a fief of the House of Este for over two hundred years (1552 - 1757). Curiously, Borgomanero was not touched by the plague of the mid-seventeenth century that raged in Europe, because the only four plague victims were expelled from the city and the order was given to close the gates and to isolate the city until the epidemic had died out. This decision (remarkable for the ignorance at the time on infections) saved the town from the plague.\n\nDuring the early nineteenth century, Borgomanero lost its last walls and it became a commercially and economically more modern centre.\n\nBorgomanero took an active part in the Italian Risorgimento: the brothers Ercole and Antonio Maioni paid with exile raising the Italian flag in Turin in 1821; Maddalena Zoppis lost an eye during the Five Days of Milan in 1848; Costantino Pagani was one of the volunteers participating in the Expedition of the Thousand led by Giuseppe Garibaldi. Moreover, the city was occupied by the Austrian army in the aftermath of the Battle of Novara (1849).\n\nTwentieth-century figures of note include Mora and Gibin, gold medals of the Italian resistance movement, and Achille Marazza, member of the National High Liberation Committee of Italy, who in 1967 donated the villa and library to the town, now home to the foundation that bears his name.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2077922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077922", "title": "Leptoconops torrens", "text": "Leptoconops torrens\n\nLeptoconops torrens (commonly known as the biting midge fly) is a species of small biting flies in the no-see-um family Ceratopogonidae. They were first mentioned in writing by Charles Henry Tyler Townsend in 1893. The name \"Leptoconops carteri\" is a junior synonym of \"L. torrens.\" They are prevalent in the southwestern and southeastern areas of the United States. In early stages of life, \"L. torrens\" flies dwell in soil, then emerge to feed and breed as fully developed adults.\n\n\"L. torrens\" females rely on blood meals from vertebrates for nutrition, while males feed on various plant products such as nectar. \"L. torrens\" infestations in California have caused people to take measures to control their populations. The flies are relatively small at around long and are difficult to spot, making preventing \"L. torrens\" bites difficult. Construction projects and farming efforts have been temporarily suspended because of \"L. torrens\" biting activity.\n\n\"L. torrens\" larvae have 21 body segments and are long on average. The larva has a transparent body, and mouthparts are visible through the head. These mandibles are heavily chitinized, which differs from those of other species. The antenna retracts into the head with additional chitinized parts, and no eye organs are visible. Male and female larvae are indistinguishable by size.\n\nAdults are close in appearance to the Bodega black gnat. Adult flies are about long and are black in color. Female flies have 14 antennae segments. The females have relatively stout abdomens, and have no hairs around their eye area. Males also lack hair on the face.\n\nThe species can be found from California to Utah, New Mexico, Texas, Mexico, and southeast Florida as well as the Caribbean. They have also been observed in Colorado and Nevada. Their emergences have typically been observed and recorded in California.\n\n\"L. torrens\" dwells in places with alkaline clay soil; larvae dwell in the damp soil. Soil with clay composition of more than 40% is the most suitable. Requiring this clay soil limits where \"L. torrens\" can populate. When the clay soil dries, cracks are formed to allow for adults to emerge. \"L. torrens\" tends to be in areas with cracks less than in width. They are also common in partially aquatic regions around the world, such as tropical and sub-tropical regions.\n\nThe life cycle of \"L. torrens\" is typically around two years. \n\nA female will enter cracks in the soil and lay eggs for a few days. These eggs may be spread around due to rain that seeps into the cracks. Eggs split longitudinally for the larvae to emerge. Eggs and larvae end up at around deep within the soil. When rains fall, larvae can more easily burrow through the mud.\n\nLarvae occasionally enter diapause for more than 3 years under certain conditions, such as when the soil is not sufficiently moist for their development. The size of the fly can indicate how many years it spent as a larvae. In the summer, larvae enter complete aestivation. When dormant, they are able to tolerate being submerged in accumulated rain water. Larvae typically become active once rain falls in the second winter of their larval stage.\n\nIn early May, mature larvae burrow through cracks in the soil and pupate; this process is relatively short and estimated to be about five days. If the soil is too wet and cracks do not open, the larva will enter diapause. The pupation of \"L. torrens\" has not been widely observed.\n\nAdults emerge from mid-May to June when soil is dry and cracks re-form. This period of emergence lasts around 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the season and year. The ratio of females to males emerging is generally 1.64. In the morning, flies crawl out to sun themselves and fly once the temperature is high enough. Emergence is especially abundant following heavy rain. Once fed on blood, females can mature and lay eggs. However, females may die from ruptured oviducts from egg pressure. Ovaries may contain 60 to 70 eggs.\n\nFemale \"L. torrens\" feed only once, taking blood meals from vertebrates by burrowing into the feathers or fur of warm-blooded animals. There is evidence that females may also prey males if there are no warm-blooded hosts available. Before biting, flies explore the host before feeding for around 1.5 minutes. They are difficult to frighten away before biting, but are more easily shooed afterwards. Once the fly has fed, it defecates, sometimes with a drop of ingested blood. Feeding can take any time from 2 to 4 minutes. Because only the females feed on blood, \"L. torrens\" is considered a facultative hematophage.\n\nMales feed on nectar from plants or honeydew from other insects. If near sources of algae growth, they may also feed on algae or microbes on the algae to develop fat. \"L. torrens\" adults live for less than 12 hours without food and up to 5 days otherwise.\n\nMale \"L. torrens\" have been observed in dancing swarms, where mating occurs. The males typically emerge in the season earlier then the females do and are ready to mate as soon as the females emerge from their pupal state. The females are attracted to the swarming males and fly into the dancing swarms of the males and mate with the two insects oriented end to end.\n\nFemales may bite humans, injecting saliva under the skin where blood then pools. Females tend to bite around the head and arms. Although small, these flies can leave swellings in diameter. The bitten area initially becomes inflamed and red before shrinking. Allergic reactions and secondary infection are also concerns involving bites. Unlike some close relatives, \"L. torrens\" are not known to transmit any diseases.\n\n\"L. torrens\" is a pest, especially in California, and has been the source of several infestations. The tendency for larvae to enter diapause causes large swarms to emerge in certain years. Construction projects and farming efforts sometimes had to be temporarily suspended in the past because of \"L. torrens\" bites. Various forms of DDT were used to control populations in the past. Since adult flies rest on grass before taking flight, using pesticides just before emergence can help control populations. Malathion, diazinon, and fenthion are insecticides that has been effective in decreasing adult emergence. No tested insecticides have been able to control \"L. torrens\" from their larval stage in the soil. Planting sugar beets, alfalfa, and tomatoes may deter \"L. torrens\" from breeding. There are also specialized traps to control the flies' emergence, using methods such as carbon dioxide attractants for large-scale population control.\n"}

The group existed from 1989 to 2005, released six full-length albums, and toured heavily both throughout Australia and internationally.\n\nThe band was formed in the New South Wales outback mining town of Broken Hill in 1989 by guitarist Tim Grose featuring himself, bassist Eddie Tresize and drummer Ian DeBono. According to an extensive bio at the band's official website, Grose took on the singing role due to an inability to find a suitable vocalist. The band played popular rock and metal covers and shortly expanded to a five piece with the addition of Tim's niece Carolyn Boon on keyboards and Jason Hansen on guitar. Randall Hocking replaced Tresize and by the end of 1990 the group's line up featured Grose, Boon, Jamie Baldwin (bass), Dale Fletcher (guitar) and Darryl Riess (drums). By February 1991 however, only Tim Grose remained but a short time later guitarist Dale Corney joined him and the pair wrote and played as a duo for about a year before relocating to Sydney in 1992. A demo was recorded and Grose and Corney decided to rebuild a complete band line-up.\n\nBy 1995, Dungeon's live line-up featured Grose and Corney plus Stephen Mikulic on rhythm guitar (giving the band three guitarists), George Smith on bass and Andrew Brody on drums. Several tracks were also being recorded for a demo entitled \"Changing Moods\", with Grose providing bass and keyboards along with guitars and lead vocals. Brody played drums on the opening track \"One Shot at Life\" with Jim Yannieh, who had answered an ad in the street press, laying down the drums for the songs \"Paradise\", \"The Promise\" and \"Slave of Love\". Neither proved technically proficient enough to play on the title track, an eight-minute instrumental, so Grose contacted BMG, with whom he had a publishing deal, for recommendations. They recommended Virgil Donati, who completed the track during a four-hour session.\n\nBrody and Smith left Dungeon in 1996 shortly after the demo appeared and were replaced by ex-Maximum Carnage members Wayne Harris and Justin Sayers. Mikulic also departed shortly afterward. In the meantime, Japanese label TDK-Core had taken an interest in Dungeon and expressed a desire to release \"Changing Moods\" as an album. Instead, Dungeon chose to re-work it, remixing some of the tracks with bass lines provided by Sayers, dropping a song called \"The Promise\" and adding nine new recordings including a cover of Blondie's \"Call Me\". Released under the name \"Demolition\", the album sold well after it was released in Japan but Harris refused to take part in any promotional activity for the CD and was fired from the band. A friend of the group, Tyrone McMaster, adopted the name Ty Blakely and appeared in promotional packages accompanying the release, however this was merely to give Dungeon the appearance of a complete line-up as McMaster was not actually in the band. It was not to be the last time Dungeon was to resort to this tactic.\n\nIn spite of \"Demolition's\" moderate success, Dungeon was dealt a blow when TDK-Core decided to stop releasing rock music. The album, which was only released in Japan, is now deleted.\n\nWith Wayne Harris gone, Dungeon had no drummer but enough material for another album release. Around the same time, Sydney thrash band Addictive had disbanded. Drummer Steve Moore was put in touch with Dungeon through a mutual friend and by early 1997 the new line-up was rehearsed and beginning to appear regularly on the Sydney live metal circuit. \"Resurrection\" was then recorded in 1998, featuring a third version of \"Paradise\", keyboards from Gustav Hoffman and Sayers providing lead vocals on the tracks \"Let it Go\" and \"Wake Up\". The period of the recording process was a bleak time for the band and Grose quit at one point only to return after less than a week. Sayers was also keen to move on to other projects but he remained with Dungeon for almost another year.\n\nSeveral record labels including Century Media courted the band but Dungeon signed eventually to Sydney's Warhead Records in July 1999. Warhead specialised in releasing Australian heavy metal bands and Moore had been friends with the owner Brad Sims for many years. This possibly swayed the group's decision at the time. Justin Sayers decided to leave Dungeon at this point on friendly terms and played a small number of live shows with them until he was replaced by Brendan \"Dakk\" McDonald. McDonald had previously played guitar in a band called Dr Zeus, the same band that had supplied Dungeon with early drummer Andrew Brody. \"Resurrection\" was released in September 1999. While it sold well among the band's growing fanbase, Warhead Records folded early the next year and the album was never re-pressed. Despite this, it won them considerable notice and Dungeon supported Yngwie Malmsteen and Nevermore late in the year before making their first appearance at the Metal for the Brain festival. They would go on to play at the event every year until 2005.\n\nDungeon toured solidly for another eighteen months until Dale Corney left in September 2001. Stu Marshall then joined, playing his first show with them as they headlined at Metal for the Brain. Most of the \"A Rise to Power\" album had been written and recorded by this time, although Marshall was able to contribute some lead guitar and vocal parts before it was released. In mid-2002, the group supported German power metal band Edguy on a small scale Australian tour that concluded with them signing to Melbourne metal label Metal Warriors on stage after their performance in Sydney. \"A Rise to Power\" was released shortly afterward, with Metal Warriors owner Steve Ravic helping them secure a worldwide deal with Germany's LMP. A busy live schedule rounded out the year and included support slots with Mayhem and Destruction.\n\nIn May 2003, Dungeon went to Japan for festival appearances in Tokyo and Osaka. The tour was supported by a limited-release album of remixes and covers called \"Rising Power\". The Tokyo show was filmed and released in mid-2004 as the \"Under the Rising Sun\" DVD. Shortly afterward, LMP released \"A Rise to Power\" on the international market, featuring a completely different and cartoonish cover illustration that the band would later renounce.\n\nDungeon supported Opeth in early 2004 before entering the studio to work on both a follow-up to \"A Rise to Power\" and a new version of \"Resurrection\". Tim had always expressed dissatisfaction with the original version and demands from fans for the now-deleted album convinced Dungeon to redo it. Sessions had barely begun however when McDonald left rather acrimoniously and while Grose was able to play the bass parts on the albums, the band was due to undertake another tour with Edguy. A long-time friend of the band, Glenn Williams—who was at the time playing bass with a Brisbane hard rock band called Mobstar—took over McDonald's role for the tour. Moore was also replaced by Grahame Goode from Infernal Method. While this was mooted as a temporary move, Moore confirmed his resignation from Dungeon after the tour in August 2004. Grose and Marshall then headed overseas ahead of the release of \"One Step Beyond\", performing as a duo in Japan and Croatia with local backing musicians, and doing some other promotional work in the U.S.\n\n\"One Step Beyond\" was released in November 2004. Echoing the band's situation at the time of \"Demolition\", Justin Sayers appeared in the accompanying booklet photos despite not having been a member of Dungeon since 1999. Goode was retained as drummer and since Infernal Method had disintegrated, founding member Petar Peric came into the group on bass. Following a handful of shows both Goode and Peric quit after their appearance at the Canberra leg of Metal for the Brain in February 2005. Goode's departure was particularly unfriendly and an air of animosity has surrounded his relationship with Dungeon ever since. Williams returned to the line-up and long time fan and experienced drummer Tim Yatras took over Goode's role in time for the band to play at Metal for the Brain in Brisbane the following weekend. Yatras was considerably younger than the rest of the group but already had an impressive resume having featured in a string of black and death metal bands from the NSW South Coast area including Malice and Battalion, with whom he had recorded a CD. He had also been the touring drummer with Sydney black metal band Nazxul the previous year. In April, Dungeon supported Nightwish and then Angra before a national tour with Megadeth. Dave Mustaine's approval of Dungeon was so high he personally selected them to support Megadeth on a European tour in June. Dungeon then played shows in Japan before returning to Australia in August after promotional work in Canada and the U.S.\n\nIn September 2005, after a run of shows with wrestler Chris Jericho's band Fozzy, Dungeon issued a press release on their official website announcing that due to the departure of Marshall and Williams, Tim Grose decided to put an end to the band. They performed a final show at the Gaelic Club in Surry Hills, Sydney on 11 December 2005. Justin Sayers, Dakk McDonald and Stephen Mikulic made guest appearances during the band's almost two-hour set. A final album entitled \"The Final Chapter\" was announced. Recorded by Grose and Yatras, with guests Andy Dowling (bass) and Mav Stevens (guitar), this album was released in mid-2006.\n\nThe band's various members have moved on to other projects. Grose and Yatras continued to work together under the name Lord with Dowling. This name was previously used by Grose in 2003 for a solo release. Lord continues to play the Dungeon back-catalogue live and follows a similar musical path. Both men also featured in the Newcastle studio-based power metal band Ilium until Grose announced his departure in early 2008. Stu Marshall formed a band called 20 Grams with Yatras briefly on drums and later with Jordan Howe, a one-time member of The Harlots, on vocals. This band is now known as Paindivision and has gone on to issue two albums as of mid-2010. Former bass player Sayers plays in a heavy rock / punk act called Platinum Brunette that released an EP in early 2007 and now features Lord Tim guitar. This band released an album in early 2009. Stephen Mikulic is a member of Lycanthia. Grahame Goode and Pete Peric reformed Infernal Method shortly after their brief time with Dungeon, however that group split up for good in April 2007; Goode later joined the thrash band Killrazer and Peric is now with Nazxul. Glenn Williams joined Brisbane melodic metallers Sedition (former bassist Andy Dowling had left to join Lord.) One-time drummer Steve Moore played in thrash band Vaticide and now plays in a Brisbane rock and metal band. Dakk McDonald runs a CD/DVD duplication business. Of the band's early guitarists, Dale Fletcher died from a brain haemmorhage in January 2005, Jason Hansen builds handmade guitars and Dale Corney sings for a Broken Hill metal band called Soulforge.\n\n\n"}

Gordon was a member of Team Full Tilt.\n\nGordon is well known for his commentary on poker broadcasts. Most notably, he was a commentator on Bravo's \"Celebrity Poker Showdown\" for seven seasons, before stepping down in 2006. In 2003, he provided commentary for the WSOP Championship Event for Binion's live Internet broadcast, as well as daily reports for a national radio audience, and he provided commentary for ESPN's live pay per view broadcast of the final table of the World Series of Poker main event championship in both 2006 and 2007. He was also the lead broadcaster for the ESPN series, The \"Pro-Am Poker Equalizer\" that began airing January 6, 2007.\n\nGordon has written five books on poker, including the bestsellers \"Poker: The Real Deal\" and \"Phil Gordon's Little Green Book: Lessons and Teachings in No Limit Hold 'em\". Gordon has written for poker magazines, and writes a regular column and hosts a podcast, \"The Poker Edge\", for ESPN.com. The podcast has been airing since April 10, 2006. Gordon has also released an award-winning instructional DVD, \"Expert Insight: Final Table Poker\".\n\nGordon is well known for his philanthropic causes, especially cancer research. Gordon is an active fundraiser and sat on the Board of Directors for the Prevent Cancer Foundation until resigning in 2011 in the wake of the Full Tilt Poker scandal.\n\nIn 2003, Gordon and fellow poker pro Rafe Furst embarked on their Ultimate Sports Adventure Tour. During the trip, the pair attended more than 140 sporting events. At each stop, they collected donations, held auctions, and raffled off prizes to benefit the Prevent Cancer Foundation, raising $100,000. During the trip, Gordon and Furst came up with the idea for their \"Bad Beat on Cancer\", an initiative that asks World Series of Poker participants to pledge 1% of any winnings to cancer research. \"Bad Beat on Cancer\" has been involved in a number of other endeavors, including an annual charity poker event hosted by the Twitter Poker Tour and held online at Gordon’s Full Tilt Poker, as well as a breast cancer charity event, the \"Bad Beat on Cancer Challenge\", which was held in November 2009 on PokerStars. Bad Beat on Cancer has raised over $3 million for cancer prevention research.\n\nAs a USA Rock Paper Scissor (USARPS) Head Referee Gordon has hosted an annual $500 World Series of Rock Paper Scissors event in conjunction with the World Series of Poker since 2005. The winner of the WSORPS receives an entry into the WSOP Main Event. The event is an annual fundraiser for the Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation via Gordon's charity \"Bad Beat on Cancer\". Poker player Annie Duke won the Second Annual World Series of Rock Paper Scissors. The tournament is taped by ESPN and highlights are covered during \"The Nuts\" section of ESPN's annual WSOP broadcast. 2009 was the fifth year of the tournament.\n\nWhen Gordon is not playing poker, he often plays tournament contract bridge with some success. He has won two North American Bridge Championships (NABC) events. In 1990, he won the Red Ribbon Pairs, an event restricted to players with 2000 masterpoints or less. At the 2008 Summer NABC in Las Vegas, Gordon was on the team that won the NABC Open Swiss Teams, beating numerous world and national champion players in this event with no masterpoint limit.\n\nGordon appeared in the 2007 film \"The Grand\".

{"id": "2077945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077945", "title": "Riverine rabbit", "text": "Riverine rabbit\n\nThe riverine rabbit (\"Bunolagus monticularis\"), also known as the bushman rabbit or bushman hare, is one of the most endangered mammals in the world, with only around 500 living adults, and 1500 overall. This rabbit has an extremely limited distribution area, found only in the central and southern regions of the Karoo Desert of South Africa's Northern Cape Province. It is the only member of the genus Bunolagus because of unique traits that separate it from the other lagomorphs in the genus \"Lepus\". There is still controversy and debate between taxonomists over its classification. Many tests and karyotypic analysis has been performed on hares from the genus \"Lepus\" to compare the riverine rabbit to others that are classified as true hares.\n\nThey have a diet which consists of mostly plants and vegetation, but their usual food sources are being diminished, causing a scarcity for their population. This food loss is also connected to other problems such as with forming burrows. A unique aspect of its biology is that females can only produce one offspring per year. This contributes to how it is classified as critically endangered, which is the most severe classification available. Other unique traits include being nocturnal, and producing two different types of droppings. Currently, there are conservation plans being enacted to help with its decreasing population and habitat.\n\nThe riverine rabbit is native to the Karoo desert in South Africa. It has a general appearance that is similar to most rabbits, but the ears and body are longer. It typically has a black stripe running from the corner of the mouth over the cheek, and a white ring around each eye. It also has a brown woolly tail, cream or greyish-coloured fur on its belly and throat, and a broad, club-like hind foot. It has a dental formula of 2/1, 0/0, 3/2, 3/3, like other rabbits, with a total of 28 teeth. Its tail is pale brown with a tinge of black toward the tip. Its coat is soft and silky and its limb are short and heavily furred. Male riverine rabbit weigh approximately 1.5 kilogram while females weigh about 1.8 kilograms.\n\nThe taxonomic status of the riverine rabbit is controversial among scientists. This rabbit has specific qualities that are different from other \"Lepus\" species, resulting in the taxon generic separation. However, this rabbit still has some external characteristics and cranial conformation has caused the controversy between taxonomists. Eleven different \"Lepus\" species had a karyotypic analysis performed on them and from this tests it was learned that all hares have basically a similar G-banded karyotype. This study was done to establish whether the “karyotypic affinities of \"B. monticularis\" lay with representatives of the genus \"Lepus\" “or if the evidence found gives reason for this species to be in a genus distinct from that of true hares.\n\nThe riverine rabbit's scientific name is \"Bunolagus monticularis\". It is in the phylum Chordata, the class Mammalia, the order Lagomorpha, and the family Leporidae. Some common names referring to it are the bushman hare and the bushman rabbit. This rabbit also has less common names such as boshaas and vleihaas. These names arose from the habitats they lived in and are based on how these were moist and dense. Their broad hind paws which are furred underfoot were referred to as doekvoetjie .\n\nIt is found in only a few places in the Karoo Desert of South Africa's Northern Cape province. None of them are protected area as of 2017. As its name suggests, the Riverine rabbit prefers to occupy river basins and very particular shrubland. It feeds on the dense shrubland and the soft soil allows for it to create vast burrows and dens for protection, brooding young, and thermoregulation. The riverine rabbit lives in very dense growth along the seasonal rivers in the central semi-arid Karoo region of South Africa. Its habitat regions are tropical and terrestrial while its terrestrial biomes are desert or dune and scrub forest. Two of the most common plants in its habitat are \"Salsola glabrescens\" (11·8%) and \"Lycium\" spp. (8·5%).\n\nThey appear and live specifically in riverine vegetation on alluvial soils adjacent to seasonal rivers, though studies have found this habitat to be sixty-seven percent fragmented in certain areas. Currently the habitat is decreasing in size, contributing to this species being classified as endangered. The primary reason for the decline in habitats is due to cultivation and livestock farming. Major threats to this species comes from loss and degradation of habitat. Over the last hundred years, over two-thirds of their habitat has been lost. Today only five hundred mature riverine rabbits are estimated to be living in the wild. Removal of the natural vegetation along the rivers and streams prevent the rabbits from being able to construct stable breeding burrows. This is because of the loss of the soft alluvial top soils, which are necessary for the construction of these. Another cause of damage and loss to their habitats comes from overgrazing of domestic herbivores, which also causes degradation and fragmentation of the land. Without suitable habitat they have a lower rate of survival.\n\nThe remaining habitat is thought to only be able to support 1,435 rabbits. This displays a main cause for its endangerment, which is that there is very little habitat left that can support it.\n\nThe riverine rabbit is hunted by falconiformes and black eagles. However, it is capable of jumping over one meter high bushes when being pursued by a predator. To escape predation, it remains nocturnal, spending the day resting in a form, which is a shallow scrape made in the soil under a Karoo bush.\n\nThe riverine rabbit is predominantly known for being a “browser”. They eat riparian vegetation found along seasonal rivers in the Karoo Desert. This includes salt-loving plants such as the salsola and lycium. They sometimes eat grass depending on if it is the wet season. Aside from their conventional food intake, they also consume their day-time droppings which are soft and come directly from the anus. This is advantageous because their feces contains vitamin produced by the bacteria in the hindgut and also contains minerals such as calcium and phosphorus.\n\nRiverine rabbits are solitary and nocturnal. They feed on their preferred foods, flowers, grasses, leaves at night. During the day they rest in forms. It produces two types of droppings. While active during the night the rabbit will produce hard droppings, and during the day droppings are soft, taken directly from the anus, and swallowed. In this way the riverine rabbit obtains vitamin B, produced by bacteria in the hind gut, and minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are recycled.\n\nThey are polygamous, but they live and browse for food alone. They have intra-sexually exclusive home ranges; the males’ home ranges overlap slightly with those of the various females. Between August and May, females will make a nest in a burrow lined with grass and fur, and blocked with soil and twigs. This nest is 10–15 cm in diameter, 25 cm long.\n\nThe riverine rabbit is one of the rarest mammals in the world and very little is known about its reproductive behavior other than that it has a polygamous mating system, where males mate with more than one female. It bears its young underground for protection. The single offspring that the rabbit produces is born altricial, or bald, blind, and helpless, and weighs from 40 to 50 grams. It is the only African rabbit that bears its young underground. The helpless offspring stays with the mother until it is capable of living on its own and fending for itself. The low breeding rate of only one offspring per year is unlike most other rabbits and has led to attempts to increase numbers of this endangered species. A breeding colony has been established at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre near Pretoria. These rabbits will mate with a number of individuals, and are the only known rabbit species to make nests for the baby. Very rarely, two kits may be born at once.\n\nThe first time that the species was described by humans was in 1901, by a soldier in the British Army. Oldfield Thomas, a senior employee at the British Museum of Natural History identified a rabbit carcass as being of a new species. In 1978, during an observational study of the area, rabbits were identified near the region called “Victoria West” in South Africa. Genetically, its closest relations are to the Japanese Amami Rabbit, the Indian Hispid Hare, and Oryctolagus Cuniculus, which is a common rabbit in Europe.\n\nThe riverine rabbit provides many benefits for farmers. It causes the riverine vegetation that it eats to bind to the soil and prevent it from being washed away in floods. Also, this vegetation promotes filtration of rainwater to groundwater, which is a benefit to farmers, who often use windmills to draw up water for their livestock. Indirectly, the habitat of riverine rabbit helps humans in farming. This benefit can only be sustained if the rabbit continues to feed on this vegetation.\n\nThe riverine rabbit is a species that is in extreme danger of extinction. In 1981 it was first labeled as an endangered species. According to the IUCN Redlist It is now classified under the most severe category of endangerment (aside from extinction), which is critically endangered. It has a population of only about 500 mature rabbits and 1500 overall which both continue to decline. In addition, the IUCN Redlist predicts increased population reduction, in the immediate future. Their exact prediction is for one tenth of the population to be lost between 2002 and 2022. Another problem that this species faces in terms of population is how their already immensely small population is divided into several isolated groups, about 10 in total, all with less than 50 rabbits in each.\n\nThe decline in the population is largely due to the alteration of its habitat as over half of it has been rendered unable to support the rabbit since 1970. The reason for this is largely due to the use of land for agriculture, causing the unique needed environment of the riverine rabbit to be destroyed. The range of habitable area continues to decline, and it is predicted that over the next 100 years that another fifth of habitable area will be lost. The reason for this ongoing destruction of the rabbit’s habitat is the practice of raising animals for commercial reasons in the area, causing the environment to be transformed to serve this end. Another ongoing threat to the rabbit is how the isolated groups are divided up because fields in the area often have fencing which is impermeable to this species, designed to keep out jackals. An additional threat to the species is found in how the remaining land left that supports it is being damaged by climate change. Other sources for population reduction are found in how the rabbit is hunted for entertainment, food, and collection, and also in how the rabbit has often fallen into traps set on farms, for the purpose of capturing other bothersome animals. Soil erosion in the area of habitation is another factor in destroying the animal. Animals feeding on local vegetation decimates the already narrow scope of food for the rabbit. The practice of extracting materials from trees and destroying local vegetation destroys areas that the rabbits conventionally use to escape the heat, and also hide from animals which seek to eat or harm them. Finally, structures on rivers like dams isolate subpopulations from each other, discouraging faster population regeneration.\n\nRelatively speaking to other similar species, there is little information known about key aspects of the riverine rabbit, such as behavior and diet, so one of the most meaningful conservation efforts underway is researching this species, seeking to find critical information about the species that will lead to more effective conservation measures. The current plan to protect the remaining members of the population has been criticized, with experts claiming that a large part of the remaining land that can support the rabbit is outside the current area being preserved for it. Other efforts include engaging and educating local farmers so that they act in a way which reduces harm to the species. Also, efforts have been carried out to get landowners of the area of the habitat to agree to certain measures that help the rabbit population. One of the most important and meaningful conservation efforts has been to engage in highly thorough monitoring of rabbit populations, a task made more difficult by the emergence of a new population in 2014. This endeavor has been carried out largely by the Endangered Wildlife Trust.\n\nThe IUCN recommends several further conservation measures, demonstrating that current actions are not adequate.They recommend capturing the animal as to safely allow it to reproduce without danger of predators or of not being able to find food. They also recommend different methods of managing the habitat and the population in the wild. Finally they recommend further efforts of informing the local populace as to how to protect the rabbit. The red list also notes that further research is needed into its ecology and into the conservation actions that would be most effective.\n\nA riverine rabbit appears in the 2013 animated movie \"Khumba\".\n\n\n"}

M. Azahari, who had forged links with Sukarno's nationalist movement, together with Ahmad Zaidi, in Java in the 1940s. The idea supported and propagated the unification of all Borneo territories under British rule to form an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. Azahari personally favoured Brunei's independence and merging with British North Borneo and Sarawak to form the federation with the Sultan of Brunei as the constitutional monarch.\n\nHowever, the Brunei People’s Party was in favour of joining Malaysia on the condition it was as the unified three territories of northern Borneo with their own Sultan, and hence was strong enough to resist domination by Malaya, Singapore, Malay administrators or Chinese merchants.\n\nThe North Borneo (or Kalimantan Utara) proposal was seen as a post-decolonisation alternative by local opposition against the Malaysia plan. Local opposition throughout the Borneo territories was primarily based on economic, political, historical and cultural differences between the Borneo states and Malaya, as well as the refusal to be subjected under peninsular political domination. Joining to form Malaysia was seen as a new form of colonialism under Malaya.\n\nThe basic concept behind the formation of a union of British Borneo was partly based upon the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in Southern Africa. After the defeat of the revolutionaries in the Brunei Revolt, the idea was put to rest. Had the federation been formed, the capital city would probably have been chosen from Kuching (capital of Sarawak), Jesselton (present-day Kota Kinabalu, capital of Sabah) or Bandar Brunei (present-day Bandar Seri Begawan, capital of Brunei and the historical capital of the region).\n\nThe Sultanate of Brunei has traditionally opposed such a federation. When it was first proposed during the 1960s the Sultan of Brunei favoured joining Malaysia, though, in the end, disagreements concerning the nature of such a federation, and also disputes over oil royalties stopped this from happening.\n\nThere remain groups of people who favour the creation of such an independent state and desire separation from the rest of Malaysia. These groups see union of Malaysia as unfair to the people of Borneo, particularly Sabah, as the majority of the region's wealth goes to the Malaysian federal government. Only about 5% of the region's oil revenues go to the state government of Sabah and Sarawak. The federal government has taken 15% and other 80% goes to Petronas.\n\nMalaysian politics have usually been centred in Peninsular Malaysia, and critics see the federation neglecting the needs of East Malaysians. Some opposition parties in the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly have tried to promote a North Borneo federation. The matter was refused to be debated in the Assembly due to its sensitivity, by the coalition of governing parties in Sarawak, namely the Barisan Nasional led by Abdul Taib Mahmud.\n\nThe Malaysian general elections in 2008 and 2013 saw the populations of both the East Malaysian states voted to keep the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition in power, which lost support in its traditional Peninsular Malaysian strongholds. This has seen an increase in development in the two states.\n"}

{"id": "2077960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077960", "title": "Manischewitz", "text": "Manischewitz\n\nManischewitz (; ) is a leading brand of kosher products based in the United States, best known for its matzo and kosher wine. Founded in 1888, it became a public corporation in 1923 and remained under family control until 1990, when it was bought out by a private equity firm. On April 7, 2014, Sankaty Advisors, an arm of the private equity firm Bain Capital, bought the company from a group that included the investment firm Harbinger. It is the world's largest matzo manufacturer, one of America's largest kosher brands, and the first American exporter of matzo.\n\nThe B. Manischewitz Company, LLC was founded by Rabbi Dov Behr Manischewitz, in 1888 in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Company went public in 1923 and remained a public corporation until it was taken private in a management buyout led by Kohlberg & Company in 1990 for $42.5 million. By 1926, the Cuvier Press Club described it as the largest firm of matzo bakers in the world, and the first American exporter of the flatbread.\n\nIn the 1930s, in order to produce their products all year round, the company created Tam-Tam crackers, which are little hexagonal matzos, according to a recent book \"Manischewitz: The Matzo Family\", written by the founder's great-granddaughter, Laura Manischewitz Alpern (though the modern Tam Tam is quite different from matzo). Their original product, the square matzo, revolutionized matzo-making, which until the family's production process, used to consist of rolling the matzo and trimming the edges by hand. It was also considered quite revolutionary to make matzos by machine. The company built a second production site on Bay Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1932, to better serve the large Jewish community of the New York metropolitan area, and the Cincinnati facility was eventually closed in 1958.\n\nIn 1990, a $1 million fine was levied against the company for price fixing with its two main competitors at the time, Streit's and Horowitz. In 1998, Richard A. Bernstein purchased the company from Kohlberg. In 2004 its name was changed to the R.A.B. Food Group, LLC and today it is known as The Manischewitz Company.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2014, Manischewitz was owned by the hedge fund Harbinger Capital. Manischewitz remains the world's top matzo manufacturer and one of America's top kosher brands. On June 14, 2011, a new facility opened at 80 Avenue K in the East Ward of Newark, New Jersey, serving as plant and corporate headquarters for The Manischewitz Company. In July 2017 the company closed the facility in favor of another New Jersey location, cutting 169 jobs.\n\nManischewitz has revolutionized the way in which matzo is produced. By mass-producing matzos they turned the output of matzo-making from a strictly local product into a national, and eventually international product. Manischewitz matzos were also the first to feature uniform texture, taste, and feel. When the company first began shipping matzos they also decided to make them square, whereas before matzos had been consistently round. Manischewitz's main innovation - making matzos with machines instead of by hand - aroused some initial controversy. Some rabbis of the era claimed that in order to be acceptable for religious use, the matzo had to have been made by a man and not a machine. Manischewitz was ultimately able to overcome these concerns, in part by demonstrating the meticulous adherence to the halakha (religious rules).\n\nManischewitz acquired Horowitz-Margareten Matzo and manufactures Goodman matzo.\nIn addition to matzo, Manischewitz-labeled foods include cookies, pasta, and soups. Other well-known kosher brands associated with R.A.B. include Carmel, Elite, Mother's, Rokeach, Mrs. Adler's, and Tradition; many of these were acquired by R.A.B. after successful runs as independent kosher labels. Kosher foods such as these are staples of many supermarkets in the United States.\n\nR.A.B. is not involved with Manischewitz wine, however, except in name. It has, since 1986, licensed the Manischewitz brand name to the Manischewitz Wine Company, a subsidiary of Canandaigua Wine Company (now Constellation Brands).\n\nThe Manischewitz winery is located in Canandaigua, New York, and since 1987 it has been the property of Constellation Brands, which continues to license the Manischewitz name from R.A.B. Foods. The Winery was founded by Leo Star and run by the Star family since 1927.\n\nThe Manischewitz winery is best known for its budget concord wine, which is widely available in much of North America. Made from labrusca grapes, its aroma is unusual, and is combined with a large amount of residual sugar. Because concord was popularized by the U.S. media over the years as being \"the\" kosher wine, it is often the wine that is used to celebrate Passover by non-Orthodox Jews. However, Manischewitz's sweet Concord contains corn syrup, a sweetener derived from corn, which is forbidden during Passover among Ashkenazi Jews. Manischewitz produces special Kosher for Passover bottling of its wines, which are sweetened with cane sugar as opposed to the corn syrup that is used throughout the year.\n\nThe sweetness of Manischewitz wine and other kosher wines is often the fodder of jokes. However, Kosher wine does not have to be sweet. One of the reasons for the prevalence of sweet kosher wine in the U.S., and in the Americas generally, dates back to the early days of Jews in America, when they needed to locally produce kosher wine for the Kiddush ritual that is performed on the Shabbat and holidays. The combination of a limited choice of grape varieties that could grow in the areas where Jews had settled, along with the limited amount of time that was available to produce the wine and a market that was dominated by hard cider, yielded a bitter wine that had to be sweetened in order to make it palatable.\n\nBecause the sweet Manischewitz variety of wine is so well known in the U.S., the existence of a thriving kosher wine industry that is anchored by vineyards in France and Israel, along with a growing U.S. industry, is often a surprise to Americans who are unaccustomed to taking kosher wine seriously.\n\nThe company has used the slogan \"Man-O-Manischewitz What a Wine!\" for advertising. The company and this advertising campaign are fictionally represented in season five of \"Mad Men\" as a new account.\n\n\n"}

She attempted to kill Grigori Rasputin in 1914.\n\nAccording to the records of the Extraordinary Investigative Commission of the Provisional Government, Khioniya Guseva was a peasant of Syzran district uyezd of Simbirsk guberniya. \nThe dates of Guseva's birth and death are unknown, but the police report indicates that she was 33 when she tried to assassinate Rasputin.\nShe was lacking a nose.\n\nAccording to her own testimony, she never suffered from syphilis but was \"damaged by medicines\" since she was 13.\n\nShe attempted to assassinate Grigori Rasputin in his home village of Pokrovskoye, Tobolsk Governorate, where she arrived on 16 June 1914.

It was released on February 23, 2005, by Epic Records. Following the release of her third studio album \"This Is Me... Then\" (2002), which was dedicated to her fiancé at the time Ben Affleck, Lopez decided to focus on her film career. After her engagement to Affleck ended, Lopez put her career on hiatus, as she felt that it had been on a \"roller-coaster\" ride for years. She soon married fellow Hispanic recording artist Marc Anthony, and professed that she had entered \"phase two\" of her life, signifying a new beginning.\n\nIn late 2004, Lopez began working on \"Rebirth\" with producers such as Cory Rooney, Tim & Bob, Timbaland, Rodney Jerkins and Anthony. She explained the album's concept as her being reborn following the media circus that followed her romance with Affleck. Having taken a vacation, Lopez returned feeling innovated. Additionally, she aimed to be rid of the \"J.Lo\" persona, which she described as not being a \"real person\", confusing the public. However, she later stated that this was blown out of proportion. \"Rebirth\" was milder than her previous material, consisting of mainly mid-tempo R&B songs. It also included dance, funk, and hip hop genres.\n\nUpon its release \"Rebirth\" received generally mixed reviews. While some praised its uptempo material, other critics were unfavorable of its mild content and Lopez's vocals. The album experienced moderate success. In the United States, it peaked at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of one million copies. Globally, it reached the top ten in most major music markets. The album spawned two singles. The first, \"Get Right\", peaked atop the UK Singles Chart and reached number 12 in the United States, while \"Rebirth\"s second single \"Hold You Down\" failed to make an impact, charting moderately.\n\nIn November 2002, Lopez became engaged to actor and director Ben Affleck. Their high-profiled relationship garnered a substantial amount of media attention. The public and media began to refer to them as \"Bennifer\" and they became a prominent supercouple in the media and popular culture. That November, she released her third studio album entitled \"This Is Me... Then\". The album was dedicated to Affleck, who was her \"muse\" for the record's lyrics. The album performed strongly, opening to her highest first-week sales and becoming one of the best-selling albums of her career. However, overexposure from the media and public interest in their relationship resulted in less admiration for their work and negatively affected their careers. The couple broke off their engagement and split up by January 2004. Following this, she decided to take a break from her career, and married Marc Anthony months later. Following this, Lopez became more private, stating: \"I don't want to talk about anything that is personal or private at all, because what's the use? You're open with people, and then they try and make a soap opera out of your life.\"\n\nIn October 2004, it was reported that Lopez was in the studio working with Sean Garrett on material for her first album in two years. That December, it was announced that the album would be titled \"Rebirth\". MTV News confirmed that artists such as Fat Joe, Fabolous and Anthony would appear on the album, and revealed multiple song titles including \"Step Into My World\", \"Cherry Pie\" and \"Still Around\".\n\n\"Rebirth\" is dedicated to Paige Peterson, an eleven-year-old cancer patient whom Lopez befriended during visits to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. Peterson died in November 2004. The album's title is personal to Lopez, as she felt reborn and wanted to be rid of the \"J-Lo\" diva persona the public believed her to be. According to Digital Spy, Lopez stated, \"I'm not J.Lo, she's not a real person. She was just a bit of fun that got really crazy. I've never been anyone but Jennifer.\" She considered naming the album \"Call Me Jennifer\", as that would be her \"way of saying goodbye to the whole J.Lo thing\". This led to confusion with the public as to whether Lopez had dropped her moniker, with Lopez admitting that her comments were blown out of proportion. She later stated, \"You can call me J-Lo or you could call me Jennifer or you could call me Jenny - I don't care!\" Having recorded the album after a six-month hiatus, Lopez felt that she was \"back where she started\". Explaining that she was \"on such a roller-coaster ride\" from her first album to \"This Is Me... Then\", she stated, \"[when] I came back, this was the first project I did. I felt like it was a new beginning for me, like I was, in a way, reborn. I was where I was when I made my first album.\"\n\n\"Rebirth\" predominantly consists of dance and hip hop music, while also incorporating '80s pop-rock. Lopez was influenced by James Brown's music when creating \"Rebirth\". The album opens with the song \"Get Right\", an R&B, dance-pop and funk-influenced song written by Rich Harrison, which contains heavy horn instrumentation. The song was originally recorded by Usher with the title \"Ride\" for his album \"Confessions\", but was scrapped. \"Step Into My World\" contains African music influences, and is sung by Lopez through a breathy vocal.\n\n\"Hold You Down\" is a \"mellow\" R&B song which features Fat Joe. It samples Shirley Murdock's \"As We Lay\". The track was a \"last minute\" add to \"Rebirth\". Lopez recruited Fat Joe for the song because it was a \"friendship record\", and she didn't want to do it with anybody else. He said, \"We don't talk every day, but we got mad love for each other whenever we see each other. It's always crazy love.\" \"Whatever You Wanna Do\", also written and produced by Harrison, makes use of drums and horn instrumentals. \"Cherry Pie\" is an uptempo pop-rock song which features drums and an electric guitar; Lopez describes the song as having a \"Prince vibe\". \"I Got U\", written and produced by Jerkins, lyrically speaks about her secretive relationship with Anthony, with lyrics such as \"Sometimes real love can be not seen 'cause you're thinking what's right in front of you can't be the one for you.\"\n\n\"Still Around\" is a summer-influenced R&B song which lyrically speaks about undying love. Anthony makes a spoken appearance in the track. \"Ryde or Die\" is an intense R&B and hip hop track which was co-written by singer Brandy for 2004 album \"Afrodisiac\". The song was later given to Lopez who recorded it, with Norwood singing background vocals. \"I, Love\" is a mid-tempo song which contains staccato percussion and airy synths. The song's lyrics have Lopez convincing her lover that she cares about him, and that their chemistry isn't \"pretend\" or \"make-believe\", with her even stating that she'd die before hurting him. \"He'll Be Back\" and \"(Can't Believe) This Is Me\", the album's final tracks, have been said to address lingering issues in Lopez's own love life. \"He'll Be Back\", produced by Timbaland, has been viewed as a \"dis song\" to Ben Affleck, in which Lopez sings, \"I know better than anybody how it feels to want somebody so bad after you breakup.\" \"(Can't Believe) This Is Me\" is a power ballad produced by Anthony, which references \"every link in J.Lo's long relationship chain\".\n\nDuring the album's December 2004 release party in Stockholm, Sweden, Lopez and Anthony abruptly left the event because of reportedly disruptive loud men who were under the influence of alcohol. That month, Lopez also traveled to the United Kingdom to promote \"Rebirth\", being interviewed by radio stations such as Capital FM. \"Rebirth\" was first released in Germany and the United Kingdom on February 28, 2005. In the United States, it was released by Epic Records on March 1, 2005. It was also released by Sony Entertainment in most other regions, including Australia. On January 4, 2005, Lopez engaged in a live chat on MSN.com with her fans, in which she answered questions about \"Rebirth\" and its conception. On the day of the album's release, Lopez appeared at the Virgin Megastore in Times Square, New York City, where she signed copies of the CD. On March 3, she appeared at Hot 97's Full Frontal Hip Hop concert.\n\nLopez was slated to embark on a short promotional tour of European cities as well as Dubai, but cancelled it. She later put out a statement saying that she was ill: \"I very much wanted to be in London today but unfortunately I'm not well. At the advice of my doctors I'm unable to travel. Being sick has also caused me to cancel my European album tour.\" Lopez had expressed her hopes to embark on a world tour to support \"Rebirth\". She told MTV News: \"I've tried to plan a tour so many times. And we're planning it again. It's exciting.\" Lopez explained that her film career made it hard for her to tour, \"It's been hard to map out that amount of time to really do it right.\" However, details for a tour were never unveiled and it subsequently did not occur.\n\n\"Rebirth\" produced just two singles. \"Get Right\" was released on January 3, 2005. America Online broadcast the music video the previous day, while MTV screened the video's creation on \"Making the Video\" on January 5. The following day, the full music video aired on \"Total Request Live\", BET and FUSE. In the music video directed by Francis Lawrence, Lopez plays a number of different characters in a nightclub, \"examining all the little moments that happen almost simultaneously in a nightclub during the duration of a single song\". \"Get Right\" charted at number 12 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart. \"Hold You Down\" featuring Fat Joe was released as the album's second and final single. It peaked at number 64 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song being released as a single was criticized, with PopMatters describing it as an \"ill-fated, milquetoast duet\".\n\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, the album received an average score of 52, which indicates \"mixed or average reviews\", based on nine reviews. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised \"Rebirth\" as a \"straight-ahead dance album, alternating between sweet, breezy pop tunes\" and stated that whilst Lopez was not a \"flashy singer\", she was appealing on the record due to the fact that she was able to present her limitations in \"tuneful packages with big, exciting beats\". Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" was unfavorable of the album, calling Lopez a \"rinky-dink pop singer\". Yahoo! Music's Dan Gennoe spoke positively of the album in comparison to the singer's previous works, stating that Lopez has \"finally turned the autopilot off and decided to take her pop career seriously. The album’s called \"Rebirth\" for a reason.\" Nathan Rabin of \"The A.V. Club\" described Lopez's vocals as \"heavily processed\", giving the album a mixed review whilst opining that the album's first half \"packs a certain fizzy effervescence, but the album sags as it approaches the finishing line.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s David Browne described \"Rebirth\" as \"mild\" and was unfavorable, stating that Lopez \"wants her music to be inoffensive and as easy to swallow as baby food\" so that it could appeal to a wide consumer base.\n\nAlexis Petridis of \"The Guardian\" gave the album a mixed review, concluding, \"Despite the highlights, you're still left pondering the question: what happened to Jennifer Lopez?\" \"Today Music\"s Tracy Hopkins observed, \"\"Rebirth\" is a satisfying listen, but fans who like their Jenny from the block hot and spicy will be slightly disappointed by the disc’s milder dance-pop flavor.\" Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote in summation that the album \"kind of is like a rebirth, but it's mostly just another Jennifer Lopez record: a few good songs, some badly sung filler, great production, and a whole team of collaborators to make it all work\". Mike Schiller of PopMatters argued that \"Rebirth\" is \"anything but the renaissance that its title promises\", calling it a \"slight shift in style\" for Lopez which features \"the occasional surprise\" and is \"totally harmless\".\n\nIn the United States, \"Rebirth\" performed moderately. It debuted at number two on the US \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 261,000 copies. This was below \"This Is Me... Then\", which sold 314,000 copies in its opening week. The following week, the album dropped to number four, with sales of 87,000 copies. During its third week on the chart, \"Rebirth\" fell to number seven, selling 60,000 copies, bringing its total after three weeks to 408,000. It slipped to number twenty the following week with sales of 27,000 copies. On April 14, 2005, \"Rebirth\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over one million copies. By June 2005, the album had fallen out of the chart's top 100. As of April 14, 2005, it has sold 1,000,000 copies in the US.\n\n\"Rebirth\" entered the Canadian Albums Chart at number two, selling 19,700 copies. It was eventually certified platinum by Music Canada, marking shipments of 100,000 copies. It reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart, selling 41,000 copies during its first week.

Bloch said he has made up to $100,000 in one session while playing blackjack. He was one of the members of the team to play in Monte Carlo as detailed in Ben Mezrich's \"Busting Vegas\".\n\nBloch was featured in the blackjack documentary \"The Hot Shoe\", as well as starring in his own instructional blackjack DVD, \"Beating Blackjack\", which explains card counting.\n\nBloch started playing poker seriously in 1992, entering some small $35 weekly tournaments once a month.

His records turned into a two-part CardPlayer Magazine article.

Following the live band setting of the band's previous album, 1994's \"Beat about the Bush\", the duo sought a simpler sound that featured just themselves, with the duo trying to capture their live sound, which included experimenting with DI units and making the maximum use of pick-ups and pre-amplifiers. The album was produced by Gerard O'Farrell, who by this point had become the band's manager, and recorded in July 1995 in Bredon, Gloucestershire.\n\nIt was released in 1995 by Isis Records, before being re-rereleased by the duo's own label Hands on Music re-released the album in 1996 after the original version went out of print. The album was a turning point for the band, featuring major press attention from magazines such as \"Mojo\" and \"Q\", the latter naming it \"folk album of the year\". Oldies.com note that the album was \"considered one of that year’s finest folk releases.\"\n\nAfter folk musician Phil Beer left The Albion Band in late 1990, it allowed he and Steve Knightley to treat their project Show of Hands as a full-time musical collaboration. Show of Hands' work prior to Beer's departure from The Albion Band consisted of two albums, \"Show of Hands\" (1987) and \"Tall Ships\" (1990). The newly prioritised Show of Hands recorded \"Out for the Count\" at The Old Court in 1991, and released it on cassette that year, sold at the band's live performances. The duo briefly entered a hiatus as Show of Hands to allow to form the Anglo-Chilean band Alianza with Dave Townsend with three Chilean musicians, exploring world music. They released a self-titled album in 1992, becoming Knightley and Beer's first CD release. During the Alianza project, the duo recorded a performance from 8 June 1992 at Bridport's Bull Hotel, working with engineer Mike Trim and released it on The Road Goes on Forever in 1992 as \"Show of Hands Live\", the duo's first CD, but by the time of its release, the band's previous three albums were out of print.\n\nThe duo recorded their first, and only, studio album for TWAH! Records, \"Beat about the Bush\", in January 1994, and it was released the following month. Produced by Trim, due to his successful work on \"Show of Hands Live\", he and the duo aimed for an \"elusive \"radio friendly\" folk/roots album that retained the band's live sound whilst adding a rhythm section. Whilst the album did not attract much radio attention as the duo had wanted, it helped make the duo more popular and built upon their fan base. The duo left TWAH! Records and signed to Isis Records, the label which saw the original release of \"Lie of the Land\".\n\n\"Lie of the Land\" was recorded in July 1995 at Free for Good Studios, Bredon, near Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, a studio which belongs to Dave Pick and whose name is often initialised to FFG. This is the first time the duo recorded a studio album outside of Devon or Dorset. The album was then mixed at Sonica Studios, London, in August 1995. There are two traditional tracks on the album and ten Knightley compositions, including a re-recording of \"Exile\", one of the duo's earlier songs which had featured on their first album.\n\nThe album was produced by Gerard O'Farrell, and displays a simpler, stripped-down folk sound, as opposed to the full-band set up that the duo had used on their previous album, \"Beat about the Bush\", which the duo did not see as successful as wanted. On this album, the duo tried to capture their live sound by recording all the instruments using a DI unit. The band had originally hired O'Farrell, an engineer/producer, for their live shows, following the release of \"Beat About the Bush\". By the time he produced \"Lie of the Land\", nonetheless, he was now the duo's manager.\n\nKnightley said in an interview two years later that \"normally when people take acoustic instruments into a studio they get the mikes out. Like, 'sorry everyone - that may be what you heard live but now it's going to sound like a PROPER acoustic guitar.' Gerard [O'Farrell] was saying from his point of view the D.I. is what makes us sound different and it can kick in effects at a massive rate. The thump you get from the pickup is what turns the music into acoustic rock.\" He also later summed up the recording by noting \"overdubs were minimal\" and that the duo \"made maximum use of [their] instrument pickups and pre-amps.\"\n\nThe album was released in October 1995 on the independent record label Isis Records. Later, after releasing the duo's compilation album \"Backlog 1987–1991\", it became was their first studio album to be released on the duo's own label Hands on Music, having re-issued the album. Their debut album, \"Beat about the Bush\", was originally released on TWAH! Records before it was re-released on Hands on Music in 1999. The album cover was designed by Rob O'Connor, who also designed the cover for their previous album, \"Beat about the Bush\". It features John Carpenter, who worked post-retirement teaching Latin at the nearby Beaminster school, with a bird sat on his arm. The album cover was later included in the window display collage featured as the album cover of the duo's compilation album \"\" (2007), which features four songs from the album, namely \"The Preacher\", \"Captains\", \"The Keeper\" and a re-recording of \"Exile\".\n\nThe album was seen as a turning point, as it was given attention by major publications who gave it praiseful reviews. Bradley Torreano of Allmusic later noted that the album \"finally got them noticed by the British press\". \"Mojo\" said the album created \"a powerful, fresh sounding music with both integrity and widespread appeal\", while \"Q magazine\" called it a \"startlingly good\" album and went one step further in voting it their \"folk album of the year\" in 1996. Oldies.com note that the album was \"considered one of that year’s finest folk releases.\" Knightley himself, whilst writing about the album in 2007, acknowledged the album earned them \"some excellent critical feedback\".\n\nHaving by now built up a considerable fanbase through their mailing list, largely due to the success of \"Lie of the Land\", the duo and O’Farrell took the gamble of hiring London’s Royal Albert Hall for a performance on the evening of 24 March 1996. The duo's website biography says that \"hiring the hall to the amusement of the media and the cynicism of sceptics they had the last laugh, with a sold out show. It was a huge gamble but the night of March 24 1996 proved that for this enigmatic, indy duo anything was possible.\" The performance was released as the band's second live album, \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\", later on in 1996, and became the duo's best selling album. The duo also released the documentary film \"Acoustic Workshop\" on VHS in 1996, described as a \"unique insight into the arrangements, instruments and techniques\" of the duo's music. \"The Man in Green\" was included on the various artist compilation album \"The Best of British Folk\" (2000).\n\nAll songs written by Steve Knightley, except where noted.\n\n\n"}

In 1922 she married Ismael Nery (1900–1934), a painter and poet who introduced Adalgisa to a circle of Brazilian artists and intellectuals that included Manuel Bandeira, Jorge de Lima and Murilo Mendes. The Nerys lived in Europe from 1927 to 1929, where they met the artist Marc Chagall and the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos. Ismael died of tuberculosis in 1934, leaving Adalgisa with two sons.\n\nNery began to publish poetry and fiction after her first husband's death. Her first book, \"Poemas\", published in 1937, received critical acclaim, and she wrote short stories and magazine articles. Although the poet Murilo Mendes had proposed marriage to Nery in the late 1930s, she married in 1940 Lourival Fontes (1899–1967), director general of the Department of Press and Propaganda (DIP). In the dictatorship (\"Estado Novo\") of Getúlio Vargas, the DIP was in charge of censorship. Nery assisted the DIP as a social director and public relations officer. When Fontes was named Brazilian ambassador to Mexico in 1944, Nery accompanied him and met Diego Rivera (who painted Nery's portrait), Frida Kahlo, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros.\n\nAfter Nery and Fontes separated in 1953, Nery began the political phase of her career. As a columnist for the Rio de Janeiro newspaper \"Última Hora\" from 1954 to 1966, she advocated socialism and Brazilian nationalism. The success of her newspaper column helped Nery to be elected as a member of the constituent assembly for Guanabara State (now the city of Rio de Janeiro) in 1960 for the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB). Nery distinguished herself in the state legislature for her opposition to Guanabara Governor Carlos Lacerda and her high ethical standards. She was reelected to the state legislature in 1962 and 1966. After the military regime banned political parties in 1965, Nery joined the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), which was the official opposition to the military regime. In 1969, the military junta then governing Brazil ended Nery's mandate and stripped her of the right to run for office or vote for 10 years.\n\nNery spent the last years of her life in increasing depression and seclusion. She died in a retirement home in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nVarious short stories and poems by Nery have been translated into English, French, German and Italian.\n\n\nCallado, Ana Arruda. \"Adalgisa Nery: muito amada e muito só\".

He is often said to be the \"Shakespeare of ballads\" – he wrote more than 102 ballads that have been translated into over 50 languages, as well as the \"Toldi trilogy\", to mention his most famous works.\n\nHe was born in Nagyszalonta, Bihar county, Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire. He was the youngest of ten children, but because of tuberculosis running in the family, only two of them lived beyond childhood. At the time of his birth, his older sister Sára was already married and his parents, György Arany and Sára Megyeri, were 60 and 44 years old, respectively. János Arany learned to read and write early on, and was reported to read anything he could find in Hungarian and Latin. Since his parents needed support early in Arany's life, he began working at the age of 14 as an associate teacher.\n\nFrom 1833 he attended the Reformed College of Debrecen where he studied German and French, though he quickly became tired of scholarly life, and temporarily joined an acting troupe. Later on, he worked in Nagyszalonta, Debrecen, and Budapest as teacher, newspaper editor, and in various clerk positions.\n\nIn 1840 he married (1816–1885). They had two children, Julianna, whose early death by pneumonia devastated the poet, and , who also became a poet and a collector of Hungarian folktales.\n\nIn 1847, he won the competition of the Kisfaludy Society with his writing, \"\"Az elveszett alkotmány\"\" (\"\"The lost constitution\"\" in English).\n\nAfter \"Toldi\", one of his most famous works, was published, he and Sándor Petőfi became close friends (see their letters: To János Arany by Petőfi and Reply to Petőfi by Arany). Petőfi's death in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 had a great impact on him.\n\nHe was employed as a teacher in Nagykőrös where the local museum is named after him.\n\nArany was elected a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1858. He was the secretary-general of the Academy from 1865. Also, he was elected director of the Kisfaludy Society, the greatest literary association of Hungary.\n\nThe early death of his daughter, Julianna in 1865 marked the beginning of Arany's hiatus as a poet. He did not write any original pieces until the summer of 1877, when he began working on his poetic cycle entitled \"Őszikék\" which is substantially different from his previous works, concerning themes like elderliness, or the imminence of death.\n\nArany died in Budapest on 22 October 1882.\n\nHe translated three dramas of Shakespeare into Hungarian, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", \"Hamlet\" and \"King John\", and they are considered to be some of the greatest translations into Hungarian in history; he also helped other Hungarian translators with his comments, and translated works by Aristophanes, Mikhail Lermontov, Aleksandr Pushkin, and Molière.\n\nThe epic poetry of János Arany presents the legendary and historical past of his nation. \"The Death of King Buda\" (1864), the first part of a projected Hun trilogy is one of the best narrative poems in Hungarian literature. The other parts of the trilogy (\"Ildikó\", and \"Prince Csaba\") are unfinished. The proposed trilogy used Arnold Ipolyi's \"Magyar Mythologia\" as a source. Arany's works have shaped the popular impression of Hungarian history (at the expense of the actual historical record).\n\nOne of his most famous poems is \"A Walesi Bárdok\" (The Bards of Wales). Arany wrote this poem when Franz Joseph I of Austria visited Hungary for the first time after defeating the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Originally Arany was asked to write a poem to praise the Emperor but he wrote a piece concerning the campaigns of Edward I of England to subjugate the Welsh and trample over their culture. Arany was drawing a parallel here with Austria's treatment of Hungary and the Hungarians.\n\nHis poem \"Dante\" is one of those few verses in Western literature that can seize concisely the whole meaning and transcendency of human life (Peter Ustinov – British actor).\n\nSome remarkable pieces of Arany's works have been translated to English by Watson Kirkconnell.\n\nArany is today considered as one of the greatest Hungarian poets beside Sándor Petőfi, Endre Ady, Miklós Radnóti and Attila József.\n\nThe first scientific monograph on Arany was written by Frigyes Riedl.\n\nThe \"Arany-album\", a Folk metal album by Hungarian band Dalriada is based on popular works by Arany. It won the 2009 HangSúly Hungarian Metal Awards out of 70 contestants.\n\n\n"}

The Act consolidated previous electoral law, but also made some changes to administration. Representation of the People amendments followed in 1969, 1977, 1978, and 1980, all being repealed through consolidation into the Representation of the People Act 1983.\n\nThe principal change was to provide for the conduct of future reviews of Parliamentary boundaries by the permanent Parliamentary Boundary Commissions. The Act also abolished the terms 'Parliamentary Borough' and 'Parliamentary County', renaming them 'Borough constituency' and 'County constituency', abolished the university constituencies, and removed a requirement that the City of London form its own constituency. The Boundary Commissions were instructed to review all boundaries within 3-7 years from the Act coming into force, and thereafter to review the boundaries periodically.\n\nIn addition the Act made some changes to the franchise, removing the remaining provisions allowing plural voting in parliamentary elections by people who owned business premises. (However, plural voting for local government elections continued until it was abolished, outside the City of London, by the Representation of the People Act 1969. It still exists in the City of London - see City of London Corporation elections). From this point forward, there was a single electoral register for both local government and Parliamentary elections and each voter was only allowed to vote once in any general election even if they happened to be registered in more than one address for local elections.\n\n"}

As a country boy from Long Island, he had to learn how to stand up to the workers in the rolling mills. By the age of 20, he had been recognized as the toughest fighter in the mill. Kilrain was also a champion rower having won the National Amateur Junior Sculling Championship in 1883. He was later stripped of that honor when it was discovered that he was a prizefighter and thus could not be considered an amateur.\n\nIn 1883, Kilrain took up prizefighting as a profession and quickly established a reputation as a very tough fighter.\n\nBy 1887 Kilrain already has been recognized as the U.S. National Champion, that gave him an opportunity to fight for the Championship of the World and silver belt versus the British Champion Jem Smith, scheduled to take place in December 1887, in France, at a little island on the River Seine, called St. Pierre d'Autils. The bout was attended by about a hundred of the upper class spectators and journalists, mainly from England, being covered by the major international media of the day, such as \"Reuters\", \"Gaulois\", etc. They fought 1-minute rounds with 30 seconds break between the rounds. At the outset the men fought evenly. After the 3rd round Kilrain scored several knockdowns, and wrestling formed the principal mode of operations for the rest of the fight. Before the 106th round had started, after two hours and a half of fighting (roughly three times the full duration of modern-day 12-round championship fights,) when darkness set in, the bout was stopped due to technical reasons, as no artificial lighting of the scene has been arranged the outcome was called a draw due to darkness.\n\nClearly dominant throughout the fight (even the English newspapers wrote that \"the Englishman was no match for the American crack\",) upon his return to the United States, Kilrain was pronounced by Richard K. Fox of the National Police Gazette as Heavyweight Champion of the World for his bout with Jem Smith. The awarding of the belt to Kilrain was part of a strategy by Fox to draw Sullivan into a fight. Any remote claim he had to the title of world champion was lost in 1889 after his loss to John L. Sullivan.\n\nKilrain is perhaps best known for challenging champion John L. Sullivan in 1889 in the last world heavyweight championship prizefight decided with bare knuckles under London Prize Ring rules in history. They fought 1-minute rounds with 50 seconds break between the rounds. In a hard-fought contest, Kilrain lost at the start of the 76th round (after 2 hours 16 minutes) when Mike Donovan, his second, threw in the sponge. Kilrain had not wanted to give up thinking that he could outlast Sullivan, but Donovan defended his actions insisting that Kilrain would have died had the fight gone on. In any case, the Kilrain-Sullivan fight can rightly be listed among the greatest fights of the pre-modern era.\n\nKilrain continued on for 10 more years after the Sullivan fight with gloves under Marquis of Queensberry rules with some success. His most significant win was a 44-round knockout of Boston's George Godfrey in 1891. He retired with a record of 18 wins (3 by KO), 6 losses and 12 draws along with 1 non-decision. He lived in his later years as a devoted family man with his wife and children as proprietor of a saloon in Baltimore, Maryland. After his saloon burned down, he moved back to Somerville and was given a job with the parks department. After government cutbacks during the Great Depression he became a night watchman at a Quincy, Massachusetts shipyard.\n\nIn his later life, Kilrain became good friends with John L. Sullivan. When Sullivan died in 1918, Kilrain served as a pallbearer at the funeral. He was also godfather to the English boxer Charley Mitchell's son Charles Mitchell.\n\nKilrain died on December 22, 1937 in a local hospital from complications of old age and diabetes, aged 78. \n\nKilrain was elected to the Bare Knuckle Boxing Hall of Fame in 2009 and to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nScottish boxer and welterweight champion Henry Owens would later fight under the name \"Jake Kilrain\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2078119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078119", "title": "Claude Frollo", "text": "Claude Frollo\n\n\"Monseigneur\" Claude Frollo () is a fictional character and the main antagonist of Victor Hugo's 1831 novel \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\" (known in French as \"Notre-Dame de Paris\"). He is the Archdeacon of Notre Dame.\n\nDom Claude Frollo is a pious and highly knowledgeable man who was orphaned along with his younger brother Jehan when their parents died of the plague. His studies led him to become the Archdeacon of Josas, which is his position during the events of the novel. He also has a small fief which brings him a little money, most of which goes to fund his brother's alcoholism.\n\nDuring a holiday at Notre Dame called Quasimodo Sunday, he rescues a deformed hunchback child whom he finds abandoned on the cathedral's foundlings bed. He adopts the boy, names him \"Quasimodo\" after the holiday, raises him like a son, and teaches him a sort of sign language when Quasimodo is deafened by the cathedral’s bells. Frollo is a respected scholar and studies several languages, law, medicine, science and theology. However, he becomes infatuated with alchemy, which leads townspeople to spread the rumor that he is a sorcerer. He also believes strongly in fate. All this, along with his extreme and irrational fear of women, contribute further to his isolation from society.\n\nFrollo also has strong passions, even though he is a celibate due to his station within the church. These passions erupt in him through his contact with the beautiful gypsy girl Esméralda, and eventually, they prove his undoing. He considers her to be a temptation sent by the Devil to test his faith, and curses her as a demon. He finds that he cannot resist her, however, and determines to give in to temptation. Esmeralda, however, is repulsed by his advances. Frollo orders Quasimodo to abduct her, and then abandons him when the hunchback is suddenly captured by Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers and his guards. Frollo even ignores Quasimodo when he sees him being publicly humiliated for the crime. When Frollo discovers that Esmeralda is in love with Phoebus, he spies on the meeting between them which Esmeralda has arranged – with Phoebus' consent, as Phoebus only wants one night of passion. As Phoebus and Esmeralda are about to make love, Frollo, in a jealous rage, stabs Phoebus, and kisses Esmeralda when she faints before fleeing.\n\nFrollo does not attempt to intercede when Esmeralda is turned over to the magistrate on charges of witchcraft and attempted murder, but he stabs himself during her torture and shows her the wound as a proof of his lust for her. She is unmoved, however, as she is still in love with Phoebus. Shortly before the day she is to be executed, Frollo leaves Paris in a feverish madness, not realizing that Quasimodo – who is in love with her – has rescued her from the gallows. When he returns to the news that Esmeralda is still alive, he becomes as jealous of Quasimodo as he was of Phoebus. Frollo later attempts to rape her at her sanctuary in the cathedral, but Quasimodo – who doesn't realize who Esmeralda's attacker is at first – comes to the girl's defense and beats him up. Angered and humiliated, Frollo decides to rid himself of Esmeralda by handing her over to the authorities.\n\nFrollo's time comes when a group of scoundrels, enraged by news that the French monarchy has ordered Esmeralda to be taken from the cathedral and hanged within three days, arm themselves to assault Notre Dame Cathedral. While Quasimodo is busy fighting off the scoundrels, Pierre Gringoire, Esmeralda's husband – whom she only married to save his life – and a hooded figure sneak into the Cathedral and convince Esmeralda to sneak out with them. The man's face is hidden behind a hood, leaving Esmeralda to guess his identity. They flee to a boat on the River Seine, then separate when they head to shore, with Gringoire taking her goat, Djali, and leaving Esmeralda with the unknown man. The hooded figure drags Esmeralda to a nearby gallows and identifies himself as Frollo by removing his hood.\n\nFrollo issues Esmeralda his final ultimatum: either she must submit to him, or he will hand her over to the authorities. She rejects him, so he leaves her to an anchoress to hold her for the royal soldiers coming to hang her and goes back to Notre Dame Cathedral. He then walks up to one of the cathedral's towers to watch the girl being hanged, unaware that Quasimodo has spotted him and followed him upstairs. He watches calmly while Esmeralda is taken to the gallows.\n\nWhen Quasimodo sees him laughing at Esmeralda's hanging, he becomes enraged and pushes Frollo off the balustrade. A gargoyle stops his fall, and he cries out to Quasimodo for help, but Quasimodo remains silent. Then Frollo falls down off the cathedral, colliding with the roof of a house. He slides down the roof, hits the pavement of the town square and dies.\n\nVictor Hugo's novel has been adapted to film on numerous occasions. Due to policy of the NAMPI Thirteen Points, the filmmakers of the 1923 film adaptation would not portray a member of the Roman Catholic Church in a negative and controversial light. As a result, Claude Frollo is not the villain, but instead a good-hearted archdeacon of Notre Dame, and the villain of the film is actually his younger brother Jehan (played by Brandon Hurst). The 1939 film had a similar change for the same reason due to policy of the Hays Production Code; the only difference is that Claude is portrayed as the Archbishop of Paris and Jehan (played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke) is portrayed as King Louis XI's chief justice of Paris. In Disney's 1996 animated film, Claude is Paris' judge/Minister of Justice and the villain as in the novel, the Archdeacon of Notre Dame is a separate character entirely (and voiced by David Ogden Stiers), and the character of Jehan is omitted.\n\nHowever, Jehan appeared as he was originally portrayed in the novel in the following adaptations:\n\nAmong the actors who played Claude Frollo over the years in each adaptation of the novel are:\nIn Disney's 1996 animated film version of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", Judge Claude Frollo was voiced by Tony Jay, whom directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale chose for the role based on his brief appearance as Monsieur D'Arque in their previous film, \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991) and animated by Kathy Zielinski. The character's features were inspired by those of the actor Stewart Granger and, only specifically his appearance in the 1953 film \"The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T\", of Hans Conreid. The film's producer, Don Hahn, stated that the character of Frollo was inspired by Ralph Fiennes' performance as Amon Göth from \"Schindler's List\", who murders Jews yet desires his Jewish maid. Screenwriter Tab Murphy made Frollo Paris' justice minister rather than an archdeacon, thus avoiding religious sensibilities in the finished film.\n\nFrollo is portrayed in the film as the cruel, infamous, ruthless, self-righteous, and fanatically religious Minister of Justice of Paris. He despises Paris’ Gypsy population and desires to wipe out their entire race. Like his original character in Victor Hugo's novel, Frollo lusts after Esmeralda to the point of obsession, and demands her to choose to be his or die. Frollo believes everything he does is in accordance with God's will, despite frequent disagreements with the Archdeacon of Notre Dame. While in the novel Frollo genuinely cares for Quasimodo, in this film he is Quasimodo's reluctant guardian and took him in only out of fear of God’s punishment and the hope that the hunchback will someday be useful to him. Trousdale described the film's Frollo as \"a horrible, horrible person\", while Jay compared him to Hannibal Lecter in \"The Silence of the Lambs\".\n\nIn the beginning of the film, Frollo and his soldiers capture a group of Gypsy peasants attempting to sneak illegally into Paris on a boat. A Gypsy woman in the group attempts to flee with her deformed baby, but Frollo kills her outside Notre Dame Cathedral. He tries to kill the baby as well, but the cathedral's archdeacon intervenes and accuses Frollo of murdering an innocent woman. Fearing divine retribution, Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise the deformed child in Notre Dame as his son, naming him \"Quasimodo\", and teaching him that the world outside the cathedral is a sinful place full of people who would hate him for his deformity.\n\nTwenty years later, in the Palace of Justice, Frollo appoints a new Captain of the Guard, Phoebus, stating his intent to eradicate the city's Gypsy population by discovering their sanctuary, the \"Court of Miracles\". While attending the annual Festival of Fools, Frollo discovers a Gypsy dancer, Esmeralda, who attracts him with her beauty. He finds that Quasimodo has left the bell tower and joined the Festival. Quasimodo is humiliated by the crowd after two of Frollo's guards start a riot. Frollo refuses to help Quasimodo, going so far as to refuse Phoebus' request to stop it, and he is angered when Esmeralda defiantly decides to help Quasimodo. Esmeralda rebukes Frollo before claiming sanctuary inside the cathedral.\n\nFrollo soon develops lustful feelings for Esmeralda and begs the Virgin Mary to save him from her \"spell\"; he then resolves that “she will be mine, or she will burn”. When Frollo learns that she has escaped Notre Dame, he instigates a citywide manhunt for her, even going as far as capturing and bribing Gypsies and burning countless houses in his way. Phoebus is appalled by Frollo's actions and openly defies him, and Frollo sentences him to death. While fleeing on Frollo's horse, Phoebus is struck by an arrow and falls into the River Seine, but Esmeralda rescues him just in time and takes him to Notre Dame for refuge.\n\nFrollo returns to Notre Dame later that night and discovers that Quasimodo had helped Esmeralda escape. He lies to Quasimodo, saying that he knows about the Court of Miracles and that he intends to attack at dawn with 1,000 men. Following Quasimodo and Phoebus to the Court of Miracles, Frollo and his men capture all the Gypsies present. Frollo prepares to burn Esmeralda at the stake, but offers to spare her life if she submits to his desires. A disgusted Esmeralda refuses and spits on his face, and Frollo prepares to execute her. Quasimodo rescues her, however, and brings her to the cathedral. Frollo orders his soldiers to attack and seize the cathedral. Phoebus releases the Gypsies and rallies the citizens of Paris against Frollo and his men. Quasimodo pours molten lead onto the streets to ensure that no one enters, but Frollo manages to get inside. Frollo attempts to kill Quasimodo, but Quasimodo overpowers him, and openly rejects everything that Frollo raised him to believe. Frollo pursues Quasimodo and Esmeralda to the balcony, where he taunts Quasimodo with the truth about his mother. Frollo knocks Quasimodo over the edge, but Quasimodo manages to hold on and ends up pulling Frollo along with him. Frollo climbs onto a gargoyle and raises his sword to strike at Esmeralda, but the gargoyle crumbles underneath him, causing him to lose his balance. In a vision, Frollo sees the gargoyle's face transform into that of Satan. Terrified, Frollo screams as the gargoyle breaks off entirely, sending him falling to his death into the molten lead below.\n\n\n\n"}

The character was created by writer and artist Frank Borth, and debuted in \"Feature Comics\" #57, which bore a cover date of June, 1942. Borth continued to write and draw the Spider Widow feature until the end of its run in \"Feature Comics\" #72 (June, 1943).\n\nSpider Widow is the secret identity of Dianne Grayton, a bored and wealthy athlete who decides to fight crime and foreign saboteurs after discovering she has the ability to control deadly black widow spiders. She disguises herself in a stereotypical Hallowe'en witch costume, wearing a green-faced old crone mask, a floppy black hat, and a long black dress. In her new guise, she calls herself \"the Spider Widow, Grandmother of Terror\". \n\nIn a genre dominated by beautiful young superheroines with shapely bodies, Spider Widow was one of the few to subvert that stereotype; she's \"a lovely young woman who actually made herself look like a hideous old hag to fight crime.\" Valerie Estelle Frankel compares her to the heroine of the 1940-1944 Fiction House comic \"Fantomah, Mystery Woman of the Jungle\", writing, \"They transformed from nice young ladies into crone faces of rage and power.\"\n\nSpider Widow had a complicated relationship with two other Quality heroes, forming a tentative romantic relationship with a male superhero, the Raven, and a corresponding rivalry with Phantom Lady for his affections. Trina Robbins notes that Spider Widow \"turned the tables\" on the usual hero/sidekick relationship, being a female hero with a lovestruck male assistant.\n\n\"The Quality Companion\" says that \"this feature seemed to end before its time, probably a victim of Borth's entry into military service.\" When Borth returned from military service in 1946, he was hoping that he could return and write more \"Spider Widow\" stories, but was told that there were too many GIs returning, and Quality couldn't give everyone their jobs back. He moved on to create a daily adventure newspaper strip, \"Ken Stuart\", for the Frank J. Markey Syndicate.\n\nIn \"Feature Comics\" #60 (Sept 1942), Nazi agents set a trap for Spider Widow by posting an advertisement in the newspaper that requests her assistance, and then knock her out when she shows up. She is rescued from a boat bound for Germany by the bird-costumed Raven on his first heroic outing, and the two reveal a hidden U-boat to the U.S. Navy. She becomes romantically involved with the Raven (who is later revealed to be Tony Grey); however, neither initially knows what the other looks like without their mask on because they shared their first kiss in the dark. Starting with #60, the stories are billed as \"Spider-Widow and the Raven\".\n\nThe two later team up with Phantom Lady in a multi-part crossover that spanned between \"Feature Comics\" #69-71 and \"Police Comics\" #20-22. This was the only time that Quality Comics' superhero characters ever appeared in each other's strips. Though Spider Widow initially worries that Phantom Lady is a potential rival for the Raven's affections, they nevertheless became allies.\n\nThe Spider Widow, the Raven and Phantom Lady appear in each other's stories for several months in 1943, but her final adventure in issue #72 (Oct 1943) was a solo act. The character also appeared in two issues of \"Police Comics\" in 1943.\n\nSpider Widow has the ability to psychically control black widow spiders. The reason for her gaining this power is never explained. She is also a trained athlete.\n\nSpider Widow inspired a character called the Widow in the 2002 Elseworlds miniseries \"\", by John Arcudi.\n\n"}

They are, however, designated as a Scheduled Tribe in Sonbhadra district.\n\nThe Baiga do not plow the land, because they say it would be a sin to scratch the breast of their Mother, and they could never ask their Mother to produce food from the same patch of earth time and time again: she would have become weakened. The Baiga tribes practice shifting cultivation, called 'bewar' or 'dahiya'.\n\nIt is believed that the ancestors of the Baigas spoke an Austroasiatic language, however no trace of it is left now. Some Baigas (specifically those from the Mandla district) have mentioned \"Baigani\" as their mother tongue in the past: Baigani is now recognised as a variety of Chhattisgarhi influenced by Gondi. Most Baigas communicate with outsiders in Hindi, and some of them also know a few local languages such as Gondi and Marathi depending on the region where they live.\n\nTattooing is an integral part of their lifestyle. This tribe inhabits the dense hilly forests in the eastern part of the Satpuras, in Shahdol, Bilaspur, Rajnandgaon, Mandla and Balaghat districts.\n\nIt is believed that this tribe is an offshoot of the Bhuiya tribe of Chhota Nagpur. A distinguishing feature of the Baiga tribe is that their women are famous for sporting tattoos of various kinds on almost all parts of their body. The women who work as tattooing artists belong to the Ojha, Badni and Dewar tribes of Madhya Pradesh are called Godharins. They are extremely knowledgeable about the different types of tattoos preferred by various tribes. Their mothers traditionally pass on this knowledge to them. Tattooing amongst the tribals commences with the approach of winter and continues until summer.\n\nBaiga cuisine primarily consists of coarse grains, such as kodo millet and kutki, and involves very little flour. Another staple food of the baiga is \"pej\", a drink that can be made from ground macca or from the water left from boiling rice. They supplement this diet with food from the forest, including many fruits and vegetables. They hunt, primarily fish and small mammals.\n\nSince the 1960s, the Baiga have been the victims of forced evictions at the hands of the Indian authorities. These are often carried out in the name of conservation, in an attempt to protect the tiger populations, but have disastrous consequences for the displaced communities.\n\n"}

His best season was 1961, when he scored 1,860 runs in first-class cricket.\n\nHis one taste of Test cricket came on the 1951/52 tour to India. Poole, who had replaced Jack Ikin because of injury, played three times for what was, in effect, an England second eleven, scoring two fifties. He was never picked for England again, his batting defensive frailties counting against him, though he continued in county cricket until 1962, and had his best season at the age of 40.

It was created on 19 March 1929 for the surgeon Sir Berkeley Moynihan, 1st Baronet, the son of the Victoria Cross recipient Andrew Moynihan. Sir Berkeley had already been created a Baronet, of Carr Manor, in 1922.\n\nThe titles fell into a six-year period of dormancy while they were the subject of a dispute on the death of his grandson, the third Baron, in 1991. This involved a complex series of legal proceedings between the third Baron's two sons, born separately by his fourth and fifth wives; the third Baron had believed that the eldest boy, Andrew, was not his son, and favoured the younger, Daniel. They were joined in the dispute by Colin Moynihan, younger half-brother of the third Baron; in March 1994 Colin Moynihan applied for a writ of summons thereby challenging the legitimacy of both sons and claiming the title for himself. In 1996 the Family Division of the High Court ruled that the third Baron's divorce from his fourth wife Editha Eduarda had been obtained by fraud, meaning that his fifth marriage to Jinna Sabiaga had been bigamous and his son by that marriage illegitimate.\n\nAfter this action had been decided, the Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords ordered DNA testing of Andrew Moynihan, which found that the third Baron was not his father. The Committee therefore resolved the disputed succession in favour of the petition from Colin Moynihan, summing up their decision by saying:\n...that neither of the two sons purporting to be the sons of the third Baron can, in fact, be an heir to the peerage. In the case of the elder, Andrew, the committee was shown overwhelming genetic evidence that he cannot be the son of the late Lord Moynihan; and so far as the younger, Daniel, is concerned, the evidence clearly shows that he is the child of a bigamous marriage and is therefore illegitimate. In those circumstances, it is clear beyond doubt that the petitioner, Colin Moynihan, must be the rightful heir and that his Petitions must succeed.\n\nThe heir apparent is the 4th Baron's elder son, The Hon. Nicholas Ewen Berkeley Moynihan (born 31 March 1994).\n\n"}

For example, along the Rupununi River, where the population is largely Amerindian, a distinct form of Guyanese Creole exists. The Georgetown (capital city) urban area has a distinct accent, while within a forty-five-minute drive away from this area the dialect/accent changes again, especially if following the coast where rural villages are located.\n\nAs with other Caribbean languages, words and phrases are very elastic, and new ones can be made up, changed or evolve within a short period. They can also be used within a very small group, until picked up by a larger community. Ethnic groups are also known to alter or include words from their own backgrounds.\n\nA socially stratified creole speech continuum also exists between Guyanese English and Standard / British English. Speech by members of the upper classes is phonetically closest to British and American English, whereas speech by members of the lower classes most closely resembles other Caribbean English dialects. A phrase such as \"I told him\" may be pronounced in various parts of the continuum:\n\nIt is common in Guyanese Creole to repeat adjectives and adverbs for emphasis (the equivalent of adding \"very\" or \"extremely\" in standard British and American English). For example, \"Dis wata de col col\" translates into \"This water is very cold\". \"Come now now\" translates into \"Come right now.\" There is also a tendency among older speakers toward replacing \"-er\" and its corresponding sound with \"-a\"; for example, \"computer\" becomes \"computa\" and \"river\" becomes \"riva\". Various items and actions have also been given their own names that either vaguely resemble or reflect corruptions of their names in standard English.\n\nThere are several phonological markers that are present in Guyanese Creole:\n\n\nThe following phrases are written as they are pronounced:\n\n\n"}

The red nucleus is pale pink, which is believed to be due to the presence of iron in at least two different forms: hemoglobin and ferritin. The structure is located in the tegmentum of the midbrain next to the substantia nigra and comprises caudal magnocellular and rostral parvocellular components. The red nucleus and substantia nigra are subcortical centers of the extrapyramidal motor system.\n\nIn a vertebrate without a significant corticospinal tract, gait is mainly controlled by the red nucleus.\n\nHowever, in primates, where the corticospinal tract is dominant, the rubrospinal tract may be regarded as vestigial in motor function. Therefore, the red nucleus is less important in primates than in many other mammals. Nevertheless, the crawling of babies is controlled by the red nucleus, as is arm swinging in typical walking. The red nucleus may play an additional role in controlling muscles of the shoulder and upper arm via projections of its magnocellular part. In humans, the red nucleus also has limited control over hands, as the rubrospinal tract is more involved in large muscle movement such as that for the arms (but not for the legs, as the tract terminates in the superior thoracic region of the spinal cord). Fine control of the fingers is not modified by the functioning of the red nucleus but relies on the corticospinal tract. The majority of red nucleus axons do not project to the spinal cord but, via its parvocellular part, relay information from the motor cortex to the cerebellum through the inferior olivary complex, an important relay center in the medulla.\n\nThe red nucleus receives many inputs from the cerebellum (interposed nucleus and the lateral cerebellar nucleus) of the \"opposite\" side and an input from the motor cortex of the \"same\" side.\n\nThe red nucleus has two sets of efferents:\n\n\n\n"}

Though not as successful as her previous album, \"Gourmandises\", this album still sold more than 400,000 copies in the first three months of its release. Unlike her previous album, which was entirely in French, this album has English versions of four of its songs. As with Alizée's first album, the entire production was the work of Mylène Farmer (Lyrics) and Laurent Boutonnat (Music), but this would be the pair's last work with Alizée.\n\nUnlike Alizée's earlier album, this album was customised for different markets, with slightly different contents. The French version did not contain any English versions of any of the tracks, whereas the international version included four English language renditions. The Japan version refers to \"J'en ai marre!\" as \"Mon bain de mousse\". In Taiwan and Hong Kong, and other traditional Chinese spoken parts of Asia, this album was launched as a two-CD set, along with an Enhanced CD not playable on DVD/VCD players, featuring videos of \"Moi...

Released on the Universal Distribution label this was the last album recorded on this label, and was seen as the album to reinforce Alizée's international career, being a guest star on many TV shows around the world, but it wasy focussed on the Asian market, as she visited Japan in 2003 and was the spokesperson for many Japanese products. In this album Alizee was showing she is growing. \"Mes Courants Électriques\" tones down some of the overt sexual themes of her debut album, but retains the energy. \"Mes Courants Électriques\" was digitally mastered using 24-bits technology and follows the libertine philosophy of her mentor, Mylène Farmer.\n\nFor the promotion of the album, Alizée traveled around the world performing in different places.\nAfter the Gourmandises success, the singer returned to France to promote her second studio album.

To promote the single, Alizée appeared on the French radio station, \"NRJ\", the video for the single was released for broadcast on March, though it was made available on MTV and many other TV channels. It was released on physical media, both CD and vinyl, on the same month.

Though the song was not mentioned by name, the leak was confirmed in a press release which revealed the title and release schedule of the album. For that moment, Alizée was preparing her trip to Japan where the album was more focused in the Asian market. In Japan, she performed in many TV shows for the promotion of album, gave many interviews to the press of the country, and was the spokeswoman of many Japanese brands. After her return to France, she arranged the release of the second single of album J'ai pas vingt ans and I'm Not Twenty (English version of the single). The music video was released for the single, and for the promotion of the single and the album she performed at the Tour de France 2003 in the official event show in Paris.\n\nFollowing the success of the album, Alizée continued performing around Europe, kept promoting her album, and released her seventh single and the third and last of the album called À contre-courant. She then announced her first tour called the En Concert Tour. Alizée keep promoting her tour and her last two album, which stayed on top of the charts.\n\n\"J'en ai marre!\" is the first single of the album. Released in February 2003, it had the single version of the song followed by an instrumental version. Later on three remixes were made available in special editions of the single. Internationally, it was released as \"I'm Fed Up!\". In Japan, it was released as \"Mon bain de mousse\" (\"my foam bath\") along with a music video and a remix version of the song. \"J'ai pas vingt ans\" is the second extract of the album, released in June 2003.

Living in a rent-controlled hotel room in Hell's Kitchen, he earns his living as an unlicensed private investigator—or, as he puts it, \"doing favors for friends.\" The series' overarching theme is mortality: the early entries are filled with scenes of Scudder alone in churches, compulsively tithing his small income, lighting candles for whatever deceased figures happen to be on his mind—and always for the girl whose life he had inadvertently taken.\n\nThe fifth entry, 1982's \"Eight Million Ways to Die\" not only featured a more intricate plot than the earlier novels, but is the first to notably move the character forward: the novel concludes with Scudder introducing himself at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Block planned to end the series there, but a promise he'd made to supply an editor friend with an original short story resulted in \"By the Dawn's Early Light,\" a story set during Scudder's drinking days in the 1970s (Abe Beame is mentioned as New York mayor) but told from the perspective of a recovering addict. The story was well-received, winning a Shamus Award for best short story of 1985. Block would go on to expand on that success with 1986's \"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes,\" which not only resurrected the series, but proved a favorite of both the author and his fans.\n\nFrom then on, Scudder's circumstances rarely remain the same for long: 1990's \"A Ticket to the Boneyard\" reunites him with Elaine Mardell, a hooker from his days on the force, and concludes with him staging the suicide of a man who had threatened their lives—a decision he recalls in a number of subsequent volumes. 1991's \"A Dance at the Slaughterhouse\" introduces TJ, a young Times Square hustler who becomes Scudder's protégé and closest ally. 1992's \"A Walk Among the Tombstones\" sees him struggling with Elaine's role as a prostitute (as well as a pair of violent kidnappers), while 1994's \"A Long Line of Dead Men\" ends with the two marrying.\n\nWhile Scudder never takes another drink (coming closest in \"Boneyard\"), alcohol continues to play a large role in his life: he continues to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings (which constitute a central setting of the later novels), and his best friend, Mick Ballou, is a career criminal and saloonkeeper with whom he often spends long nights. He also has a standing Sunday night dinner with his sponsor, Jim Faber, who eventually becomes a surrogate father figure.\n\nScudder has relaxed somewhat in recent entries, and is now far more apt to enjoy an evening at Lincoln Center with Elaine than he is to take on a job. 2005's \"All the Flowers Are Dying,\" the sixteenth title in the series, seemed to have been written as a possible final chapter. However, a new Scudder book, titled \"A Drop of the Hard Stuff,\"—a second \"flashback\" novel—was published in 2011 and again set in the 1970s but during Scudder's first year of sobriety. The novella \"A Time to Scatter Stones\" is scheduled for a 2018 publication, featuring an aging Scudder helping friends of his wife Elaine who want to escape sex work.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2078206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078206", "title": "Wanlockhead", "text": "Wanlockhead\n\nWanlockhead is a village in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, nestling in the Lowther Hills and south of Leadhills at the head of the Mennock Pass, which forms part of the Southern Uplands. It is Scotland's highest village, at an elevation of around , and can be accessed via the B797, which connects it to the A76 near Sanquhar and the A74(M) motorway at Abington.\n\nThe village was called \"Winlocke\" until 1566, derived from the Gaelic \"Cuingealach\" (the narrow pass).\n\nWanlockhead owes its existence to the lead and other mineral deposits in the surrounding hills. These deposits were first exploited by the Romans, and from the 13th century they began to be worked again in the summer. The village was founded permanently in 1680 when the Duke of Buccleuch built a lead smelting plant and workers' cottages.\n\nLead, zinc, copper and silver were mined nearby, as well as some of the world's purest gold at 22.8 carats, which was used to make the Scottish Crown. Early gold miners included Cornelius de Vos, George Bowes, and Bevis Bulmer. Wanlockhead became known as \"God's treasure house\" from the richness of its mineral resources.\n\nDespite a branch railway (see Leadhills & Wanlockhead Railway), also the highest in Scotland, which served the village from 1901 to 1939, lead mining declined in the 20th century and finished in the 1950s. From 1850 the Glasgow and South Western Railway had provided sidings at Mennock Lye Goods Depot for the use of the Wanlockhead and Leadhills mines.\n\nThe village had a curling club which was formed in 1777 and there were also quoits, bowling clubs, a drama group and a silver band which had instruments purchased for them by the Duke of Buccleuch.\n\nWilliam Symington was from Leadhills, but lived and worked in Wanlockhead. His fame lies in the fact that he designed the engine used to power the world's first steamboat. This boat was successfully tested on Dalswinton Loch near Ellisland on 14 October 1788. Dalswinton was the home of Robert Burns's landlord, Patrick Miller.\n\nRobert Burns and an associate, Thomas Sloan, visited Wanlockhead in the winter of 1789-90. The weather was very icy and they decided to have their horses' shoes 'frosted', that is sharpened to increase the grip. They had to wait their turn and took shelter at Ramage's Inn, where Burns wrote a poem entitled \"Pegasus at Wanlockhead\". Pegasus was the name of Burns' horse. Burns also visited Wanlockhead in January 1792 to explore the lead mines. He was accompanied by Maria Riddell, the sister of Robert Riddell of Friar's Carse. They breakfasted at Sanquhar and then took a poste-chaise to the mines. They went a considerable distance into the mines, braving the dark, wet and cramped conditions at first; however they had to turn back as Burns found the poor air very distressing. Burns did not record this visit, but Maria included the details in a letter.\n\nWanlockhead has a moist oceanic climate (\"Cfb\", according to the Köppen climate classification), with cool to chilly weather throughout the year, bordering on a subpolar oceanic climate (\"Cfc\", according Köppen). This town has cool summers and chilly winters, with snowfalls. It is one of the coldest inhabited places in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe village now features a lead mining museum and industrial equipment from the 18th century and is a popular tourist destination.\n\nWanlockhead is on the Southern Upland Way, a walking trail that traditionally starts at Portpatrick on the west coast, in Dumfries & Galloway, and finishes some 212 miles (341 km) away at Cockburnspath on the east coast, in the Scottish Borders.\n\nThe village is also the home of the highest pub in Scotland, the Wanlockhead Inn which opened in 2003; an earlier pub situated on a track rising from the other side of the main road through the village was considerably higher, but closed in the late 1990s.\n\nThe village is the setting for the BBC television drama series, \"Hope Springs\".\n\nWanlockhead Miners' Library is the second oldest subscription library in Great Britain and was established on 1 November 1756 with 32 male members who mainly funded the purchase of the books, etc.; a contribution was also made by mining companies who were keen to encourage such acts of 'self-improvement' amongst the miners. The Duke of Buccleuch, as the land owner, was a major patron of the library. The library was essential in facilitating a level of educational achievement that allowed some miners and their children to escape the toil of mine work.\n\nThe school housed the library at first, but as the number of books increased, it became necessary in 1787 to move the library to a cottage given for this express purpose by the mine overseers. However the cottage was a small one and it was found to be necessary to build a larger building. The number of books purchased through subscription eventually rose to over 2,000 and in 1851 a new library was built and survives to this day. In 1974 the Wanlockhead Museum Trust took over the running of the library.\n\nThe Miners' Library became a Recognised Collection of National Significance in October 2007.\n\nThis lies approximately from the village and dates from 1751. Before Wanlockhead had its own graveyard, coffins had to be transported along a typical corpse road the 8 miles (13 km) to the nearest graveyard, which was at Sanquhar. William Philip Minder who died on 2 April 1751 aged just 10 months was the first burial at the newly opened burial site.\n\nThe beam engine and water bucket pumps were introduced into Wanlockhead in 1745. The history on the beam engine is not certain, but accounts of similar engines have been recorded on a coal mine at Canonbie, Dumfriesshire, in the 1790s. The Wanlockhead Beam Engine was built, supposedly, in the middle of the 19th century and is the only lasting example of a water bucket pumping engine to be seen on a mine in the UK today.\n\nThe beam engine allowed miners to continue working in the Straitsteps mine, and assuming that there were two strokes of the beam per minute, this engine would have been able to lift around and requiring little attention it would have been left to do this twenty-four hours a day. The wooden bucket was fed from a cistern above and once the weight of water was greater than the water above the pump piston the beam was lifted, carrying water from up to below ground into a wood lined culvert which carried it off to the nearby burn. Periodically the weight of the piston was adjusted so that it remained heavier than the empty bucket, ensuring that the beam fell to start the cycle again.\n\nThe Secretary of State for Scotland in 1972 took on the guardianship of the beam engine, making it Scotland's third Industrial Monument. Historic Scotland owns and maintains the engine. A working model of the engine is located in the Museum of Scottish Lead Mining.\n\nWanlockhead is one of the birthplaces of Scottish winter sports. Curling in Wanlockhead can be traced back to 1777, when the Wanlockhead Curling Society –one of Scotland's first Curling societies- was created. Scotland's first boys' Curling club was established in Wanlockhead in 1883. The sport remained popular in the area until the 1930s, when the mines closed.\n\nSince the 1920s skiing in the Wanlockhead area has been organised intermittently by a succession of local residents as well as several non-for-profit sports clubs. Lowther Hill, above the village, is home to the only ski area in the south of Scotland, and Scotland's only community-owned ski centre. Operated by Lowther Hills Ski Club, the ski centre runs three ski lifts above the villages of Leadhills and Wanlockhead for beginners and intermediate skiers.\n\n\n\n"}

It was certified double platinum by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) in December 2001, denoting sales of over a million copies in Europe.\n\nFour singles were released from the album, including global top-five hits \"Moi... Lolita\", \"L'Alizé\" and \"Gourmandises\". In order to promote Gourmandises and her following album, Alizée embarked on the En Concert Tour in 2003 with her next successful studio album Mes courants electriques. Critics and scholars have noted the album's influence on popular music, particularly the way it helped reintroduce electronic music to the pop scene. The production style, blending acoustic and electronic instruments, is similar to English producer William Orbit's work on Madonna's 1998 album, Ray of Light.\n\nLauded by critics as a masterpiece in the contemporary French Pop repertoire, the album was acclaimed on its release with reviewers commending the singer's vocals and choice of musical direction.\n\nThe singer and the album were honored by the highest accolade given by SACEM, the \"Prix Vincent Scotto\" in 2002. The NRJ Music Awards, M6 and many others media and music institutions nominated the singer, including her nomination to the Victoires de la Musique in the \"Revelation Album of the Year\" category. Alizée was awarded the 2002 World Music Award for Best French Music Exporter with more than 4 million albums sold worldwide.\n\nRecording for the debut album started in mid-2000. The album included elements of world music, pop, chanson and dance. However, the album also incorporated strong elements of electronic music. Additionally, several genres and subgenres including techno, trip hop, drum and bass, ambient, rock and classical music influenced the album.\n\nAfter Alizée's participation in the \"Graines de star\" show where she met Laurent Boutonnat and veteran French pop diva Mylène Farmer, she was invited to record a single with their support as a songwriting team. Her collaboration with Boutonnat and Farmer on her first two albums produced a sweet but strong voice incorporating strong elements of electronic and pop music.\n\nIn July 2000 Alizée released single \"Moi... Lolita\", and after achieving high sales in France, released her second single \"L'Alizé\" in December 2000. The single reached number one in France and topped charts in several other countries across the world, however did not chart in the United States. Following the release of Gourmandises, Alizée was named Europop Queen by NRJ Radio. Three months later, third single \"Parler tout bas\" also gained number one on French radio stations. The actual album Gourmandises was released in May 2001, charting strongly worldwide.\n\nAlizée received public praise on television channel M6 and NRJ Radio. Among other nominations and awards, she was nominated for the Victoires de la Musique. The following year Alizée received the World Music Award from the IFPI for top sales. In 2003 Alizée received an award from SACEM the most prestigious recognition given for the institution the \"Prix Vincent Sotto\".\n\n\"Moi... Lolita\" was the first track from the album and was released as her debut single on 4 July 2000. It was popular in various countries such as, France, Spain, Belgium, Georgia, Austria, the Netherlands, Lebanon, Ukraine, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Russia, Greece, Italy, Germany, Poland, Denmark, United Kingdom. \"L'Alizé\" was the second single from the album and was released in December 2000. It featured the song \"L'alizé\" as well as an instrumental version of the same track. Two limited editions were also released, which featured four remixes. The song became a hit particularly in France where it reached number one for two weeks. \"Parler tout bas\" was the third single by Alizée released in April 2001. It featured an instrumental rendition of the song in addition to Alizée's solo rendering.\n\n\"Gourmandises\" received positive reviews from contemporary critics upon its release. In 2013, following speculation about Alizée's fifth album, \"5\", critics referred to \"Gourmandises\" as a \"pop masterpiece of the contemporary music\", calling it a \"classic\" of the 2000s decade and of the new millennium. \n\n\"Gourmandises\" gained Alizée worldwide fame. In three months the album sold 700,000 copies in France and over 1,000,000 in Europe. In early 2001, she won the NRJ Music Awards for Francophone Revelation after she won an M6 Award in late 2000. The album is also named in a similar category to the Victoires de la Musique. In early 2002 Alizée won the World Music Award for Best French exporter (more than 4 million records worldwide in an album).\n\nThe album's debut single \"Moi... Lolita\" generated a lot of international attention and the album launched to critical acclaim. This single is listed as the 31st best selling single in the history of France. Also released was \"L'Alizé\", which gained top of French charts for many weeks.\n\nBoth singles are listed in the French Top 100 singles of the 2000s and List of best-selling singles in France history.\nIn the same year, newspaper \"Le Figaro\" announced Alizée's music was the top earning rentable French music of the year thanks in part to Farmer and Boutonnat's collaboration, which earned 10.4 million €.\n\n\"Gourmandises\" was certified platinum in Europe, double gold in Belgium and platinum in Switzerland.\n\nCredits adapted from \"Gourmandises\" liner notes.\n\n\nThe album was considered a great commercial success.\nIn its first week of release, the album debuted at tenth place on the French Top 100 Albums Chart. Reaching number 1 in the ninth week and remaining there for the entire first month of its release, the album was certified platinum. In Europe, the album single Moi... Lolita gained popularity with the album reaching the top 25 of many European charts.\nAfter being on the French charts throughout the year, the album hit double gold in Belgium and platinum in Europe. In 2002 the album was still listed on the top charts and was then certified double platinum in France.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2078218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078218", "title": "Interchange (road)", "text": "Interchange (road)\n\nIn the field of road transport, an interchange is a road junction that uses grade separation, and typically one or more ramps, to permit traffic on at least one highway to pass through the junction without interruption from other crossing traffic streams. It differs from a standard intersection, where roads cross at grade. Interchanges are almost always used when at least one road is a controlled-access highway (freeway or motorway) or a limited-access divided highway (expressway), though they are sometimes used at junctions between surface streets.\n\n\"Note:\" The descriptions of interchanges apply to countries where vehicles drive on the right side of the road. For left-side driving, layout of the junctions is the same, only left/right is reversed.\n\n\n\"Weaving\" is an undesirable situation where traffic veering right and left must cross paths within a limited distance, to merge with traffic on the through lane.\n\nThe German Autobahn system has Autobahn-to-Autobahn interchanges of two types: a four-way interchange, the \"Autobahnkreuz\" (AK), where two motorways cross; and a three-way interchange, the \"Autobahndreieck\" (AD), where two motorways merge.\n\nSome on-ramps have a ramp meter, a dedicated mid-ramp traffic light that controls the flow of entering vehicles.\n\nA \"complete interchange\" has enough ramps to provide access from any direction of any road in the junction to any direction of any other road in the junction. A complete interchange between a freeway and another road (not a freeway) requires at least four ramps. Complete interchanges between two freeways generally have at least eight ramps, as having fewer would considerably reduce capacity and increase weaving. Using U-turns, the number for a freeway to a road can be reduced to three, by pointing both the on-ramp and the off-ramp toward the U-ramp, allowing cars entering to U-turn for the other way, and letting cars that wish to exit U-turn after passing the other road. A similar layout can be done for two freeways for six ramps, by making cars that want to turn left either turn right first and then make a U-turn, or vice versa after passing the other road.\nDepending on the interchange type and the connectivity offered other numbers of ramps may be used. For example, if a highway interchanges with a highway containing a collector/express system, additional ramps can be used to strictly link the interchanging highway with the collector and express lanes respectively. For highways with high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, ramps can be used to service these carriageways directly, thereby increasing the number of ramps used.\n\nAn \"incomplete interchange\" has at least one or more missing ramps that prevent access to at least one direction of another road in the junction from any other road in the junction.\n\nThese interchanges are between two roads with access control.\n\nA cloverleaf interchange is typically a two-level, four-way interchange where all turns across opposing traffic are handled by non-directional loop ramps. Assuming right-handed traffic, to go left vehicles first cross over or under the target route, then bear right onto a sharply curved ramp that turns roughly 270 degrees, merging onto the target route from the right, and crossing the route just departed. These loop ramps produce the namesake cloverleaf shape.\n\nTwo major advantages of cloverleafs are that they require only one bridge (between the main perpendicular routes) which makes such junctions inexpensive as long as land is plentiful, and that they often do not require any traffic signals to operate. However, weaving is a major shortcoming of cloverleafs, as the four total offramps and onramps are present (the onramp from one leaf overlaps with the offramp for the next leaf), and merge on the main routes. Consequently, the capacity of this design is comparatively low. cloverleafs also use a considerable area of land, and are more often found along older highways, in rural areas and within cities with low population densities. A variant design separates all turning traffic into a parallel carriageway to minimize the problem of weaving. Collector and distributor roads are similar, but are usually separated from the main carriageway by a divider, such as a guard rail or Jersey barrier.\n\nA stack interchange is a four-way interchange whereby a semi-directional left turn and a directional right turn are both available. Usually access to both turns is provided simultaneously by a single offramp. Assuming right-handed driving, in order to cross over incoming traffic and go left, vehicles first exit onto an off-ramp from the rightmost lane. After demerging from right-turning traffic, they complete their left turn by crossing both highways on a flyover ramp or underpass. The penultimate step is a merge with the right-turn on-ramp traffic from the opposite quadrant of the interchange. Finally an onramp merges both streams of incoming traffic into the left-bound highway. As there is only one offramp and one onramp (in that respective order), stacks do not suffer from the problem of weaving, and due to the semi-directional flyover ramps and directional ramps, they are generally safe and efficient at handling high traffic volumes in all directions.\n\nA standard stack interchange includes roads on four levels, also known as a four-level stack: including the two perpendicular highways, and one more additional level for each pair of left-turn ramps. These ramps can be stacked (cross) in various configurations above, below, or between the two interchanging highways. This makes them distinct from Turbine interchanges, where pairs of left-turn ramps are separated but at the same level. There are some stacks that could be considered five-level; however, these remain four-way interchanges, since the fifth level actually consists of dedicated ramps for HOV/bus lanes or frontage roads running through the interchange. The stack interchange between I-10 and I-405 in Los Angeles is a three-level stack, since the semi-directional ramps are spaced out far enough so they do not need to cross each other at a single point as in a conventional four-level stack.\n\nStacks are significantly more expensive than other four-way interchanges, due to the design of the four levels. Additionally they may suffer from objections of local residents, because of their height and high visual impact. Large stacks with multiple levels may have a complex appearance and are often colloquially described as \"Mixing Bowls\", \"Mixmasters\" (for a Sunbeam Products brand of electric kitchen mixers), or as \"Spaghetti Bowls\" or \"Spaghetti Junctions\" (being compared to boiled spaghetti). However they consume significantly less area of land compared to a cloverleaf interchange.\n\nCloverstack interchanges are hybrid interchanges, using loop ramps like cloverleafs to serve slower or less occupied traffic flow and flyover ramps like stack interchanges to serve faster and higher occupied traffic flow. If local and express ways serving the same directions and each roadway is connected righthand to the interchange, extra ramps are installed.\n\nThe cloverstack design is commonly used to upgrade cloverleaf interchanges to increase their capacity and eliminate weaving.\nAnother alternative to the four-level stack interchange is the turbine interchange (also known as a whirlpool). The turbine/whirlpool interchange requires fewer levels (usually two or three) while retaining semi-directional ramps throughout, and has its left-turning ramps sweep around the center of the interchange in a spiral pattern in right-hand traffic.\n\nTurbine interchanges offer slightly less vehicle capacity because the ramps typically turn more often and change height more quickly. They also require more land to construct than the typical four-level stack interchange.\n\nIn areas with rolling or mountainous terrain, turbine interchanges can take advantage of the natural topography of the land due to the constant change in the height of their ramps, and hence these are commonly used in these areas where conditions apply, reducing construction costs compared to turbine interchanges built on level ground.\nA windmill interchange is similar to a turbine interchange, but it has much sharper turns, reducing its size and capacity. The interchange is named for its similar overhead appearance to the blades of a windmill.\n\nThe junction in the Netherlands was a windmill from its opening in 1977. Since then it was renovated into a complex hybrid, combining stack, windmill and trumpet elements.\n\nA variation of the windmill, called the diverging windmill, increases capacity by altering the direction of traffic flow of the interchanging highways, making the connecting ramps much more direct. There also is a hybrid interchange somewhat like the diverging windmill in which left turn exits merge on the left, but it differs in that the left turn exits use left directional ramps.\nThere is another type of four-way interchange which is also called a \"windmill\" interchange, but it is otherwise not related to the windmill interchange described above. The term \"windmill\" has been applied to this type mainly by \"roadgeeks\", but the term has also been used by academics.\n\nThe \"windmill\" serves two arterial roadways by grade separation. All turning movements are served by a right-hand exit ramp, with stop signs or traffic signals at the ramp termini; thus it is not a free-flow interchange.\n\nVehicles make right and left-turn movements at the ramp intersections and are removed from the main intersection in conventional intersection design. Left turns can turn into left merge lanes, so vehicles have to wait for gaps in arterial traffic in only one direction (similar to the continuous green T-intersection operations.)\n\nThis application is best suited for locations where free-flow through movements are desired for both intersecting roadways, with moderate to low turning movement volumes.\n\nThis interchange design is best suited for rural locations where right-of-way is available at the intersection quadrants and quadrant development is low to minimize attraction of turning movement volumes.\n\nThe only known example of this design exists at the junction of US 35 and State Route 32 near Jackson, Ohio, United States (at ). Both highways are expressways in each direction. Each highway has ramps that exit to the other highway, with traffic merging onto the second highway, but traffic coming to an intersection. Both highways end up having intersections, albeit with a grade separation of the main highway corridors.\n\nA similar concept involves a partial cloverleaf interchange (\"parclo\") type A4, since that type of junction involves turning traffic off the freeway turning left onto the arterial, though the arterial itself exits with loop ramps eliminating left-hand turns onto the freeway, as well as to not invoke at-grade crossings for left turns onto the freeway.\n\nA further alternative found often is called a roundabout interchange. This is a normal roundabout except one (two-level) or both (three-level) mainlines pass under or over the whole interchange. The ramps of the interchanging highways meet at a roundabout, or rotary, on a separated level above, below, or in the middle of the two highways.\nHybrid interchanges use a mixture of interchange types and are not uncommon. Their construction can consist of multiple interchange designs such as loop ramps, flyovers and roundabouts.\n\nDivided volleyball interchanges create a wide median between the carriageways of the two interchanging highways, using this space for connecting ramps.\n\nFull diamond interchanges are large, multi-level interchanges that use flyover/under ramps to handle both right and left turns. One example is the junction of Interstate 40 and I-44 in Oklahoma City.\n\nOn interchanges with U-turns, traffic intending to complete a left turn must either pass the interchange, make a U-turn and then exit right, or exit right first and then make a U-turn.\n\nThere is a rarely used, unnamed type of interchange using a grade-separated design, similar to the at-grade design known as a \"synchronized split-phasing intersection\". It is somewhat like the diverging windmill except that left turn exits use left directional ramps, which, as with the diverging windmill, merge on the left. One such interchange formerly existed between Interstate 95 and I-695 north of Baltimore, which has since been replaced by a four-level stack. There are few of these \"synchronized split-phasing\" interchanges, including one in Birmingham, Alabama, between I-65 and I-20/I-59, locally called Malfunction Junction (). Another is located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between the Eastern Ring Road and the Southern Ring Road (). A variation of this type exists in Grand Rapids, Michigan, between Interstate 196 and US 131, where only the opposing carriageways of US 131 cross over each other, while the carriageways for I-196 do not cross over, but pass through the interchange on different levels. Another variation of this type exists in Charlotte, North Carolina, between I-77 and I-85, where only the opposing carriageways of I-77 cross over each other; there are loop ramps from I-77 northbound to I-85 southbound and also from I-77 southbound to I-85 northbound.\n\nThe junction of the Ontario Highway 420 and Queen Elizabeth Way is a hybrid of a partial cloverleaf interchange and a Semi-directional T interchange. The five parclo ramps provide almost all directional movements, though the QEW off-ramps meet Highway 420 at at-grade intersections. These at-grade connections can be bypassed as the interchange has an additional pair of flyover ramps that arc from south to east and the opposite movement from west to north, directing Fort Erie-bound QEW traffic onto Highway 420 eastbound and westbound Highway 420 traffic onto the Toronto-bound QEW, respectively, and another set of flyover ramps that arc from north to east and west to south, linking Toronto-bound QEW traffic to Highway 420 eastbound and Highway 420 westbound to the Fort Erie-bound QEW, respectively.\n\nTrumpet interchanges have been used where one highway terminates at another highway. These involve at least one loop ramp connecting traffic either entering or leaving the terminating expressway with the far lanes of the continuous highway.\n\nTrumpet interchanges are named as such due to their resemblance to trumpets. The bell of a trumpet can be seen where the terminating highway begins to interchange with the continuous highway, and the resemblance to the tubing is seen along the connecting loop ramps.\n\nOccasionally a third ramp can be routed around the loop instead of one of the non-looping ramps. A vehicle will therefore diverge from the continuous highway, cross it, turn 270 degrees left and cross the continuous highway again (or vice versa if the ramp is for traffic turning off the continuous highway). An example of this is where the Kingsway Tunnel terminates on the A59 in Liverpool, England because of the steep gradient of the tunnel approach there was insufficient space for a simple left-turning ramp.\n\nThese interchanges are very common on toll roads, as they concentrate all entering and exiting traffic into a single stretch of roadway, where toll plazas can be installed once to handle all traffic, especially on ticket-based tollways. A double-trumpet interchange version can be found where a toll road meets another toll road or a free highway. They are also useful when most traffic on the terminating highway is going the same direction. The turn that isn't used as often would get the slower loop ramp. Such designs are most often found in the United States, Japan, Italy and France.\nThere is a rarely built four-leg interchange type based on the trumpet interchange, of which there are three examples in Singapore (2 existing, 1 under construction), two in the United States, and one each in Norway and Sweden. One of the earliest examples of this interchange type was constructed in the 1950s and existed until 2005 at the junction between Interstate 94 and US 24 in Taylor, Michigan.\n\nA full Y-interchange (also known as a directional T interchange) is typically used when a three-way interchange is required for two or three highways interchanging in semi-parallel/perpendicular directions, but it can also be used in right-angle case as well. Their connecting ramps can spur from either the right or left side of the highway, depending on the direction of travel and the angle.\n\nDirectional T interchanges use flyover/underpass ramps for both connecting and mainline segments, and they require a moderate amount of land and moderate costs since only two levels or roadway are typically used. They get their name due to their resemblance to the capital letter \"T\", depending upon the angle from which the interchange is seen and the alignment of the roads that are interchanging. It is sometimes known as the \"New England Y\", as this design is often seen in the northeastern United States, as with the Braintree Split and the northern terminus of MA Route 24, both south of Boston.\n\nIt features directional ramps (no loops, or weaving right to turn left) and can use multi-lane ramps in comparatively little space. Some designs have two ramps and the \"inside\" thru road (on the same side as the freeway that ends) crossing each other at a three-level bridge. The directional T interchange is preferred to a trumpet interchange because a trumpet requires a loop ramp by which speeds can be reduced, but flyover ramps can handle much faster speeds. The disadvantage of the directional T is that traffic of the terminating road enters and leaves on the passing lane, so the Semi-directional T interchange (see below) is preferred instead. \n\nThe interchange of Highway 416 and Highway 417 is one of the few directional T interchanges (constructed 1990-93) built, after most transportation departments had switched over to the Semi-directional T design.\n\nExamples\nLike a directional T interchange, a semi-directional T interchange uses flyover (overpass) or underpass ramps in all directions at a three-way interchange. However, in a semi-directional T some of the splits and merges are switched to avoid ramps to and from the passing lane, eliminating the major disadvantage of the directional T. Semi-directional T interchanges are generally safe and efficient, though they do require more land and are costlier than trumpet interchanges. \n\nSemi-directional T interchanges are built as two or three-level junctions, with three-level interchanges typically being used in urban or suburban areas where land is more expensive. In a three-level Semi-directional T, the two semi-directional ramps from the terminating highway cross the surviving highway at/near a single point, which will require an overpass and underpass. In a two-level Semi-directional T, the two semi-directional ramps from the terminating highway cross each other at a different point than the surviving highway, necessitating longer ramps and often one ramp having two overpasses. Highway 412 has a three-level Semi-directional T at Highway 407 and a two-level Semi-directional T at Highway 401.\n\nHybrid interchanges use a mixture of interchange types and are not uncommon. Their construction can consist of multiple interchange designs such as loop ramps and flyovers.\n\nA half-clover interchange is essentially half a cloverleaf interchange, constructed to connect in just three directions instead of four. These are rarely used due to the traffic weaving that they cause and the large amount of land that they consume, but they can be built in areas where the connecting ramp along the loop of a trumpet interchange is not feasible due to building developments or physical limitations. Half-clovers are designed to be readily upgraded to full cloverleafs if the terminating highway is ever extended past the through highway. Numerous half-clovers exist along I-94 and I-294 in the Chicago, Illinois area. The interchange of the Conestoga Parkway and Freeport Diversion (Highway 8) was a half-clover until 2004 when a semi-directional flyover ramp replaced one of the loop ramps.\n\nA 3/4 volleyball interchange is a divided-volleyball interchange designed to meet at three points instead of four. Like the half-clover, it can easily be upgraded to a fully divided volleyball interchange if the terminating highway is extended beyond the through highway.\n\nA T-bone interchange is essentially a compacted directional T interchange with sharper turns and a lower capacity, built when there is insufficient land or funds to build a directional T. Its two flyover/flyunder ramps contract together after passing over the through highway, but then they split into two segments, resembling the bone in a T-bone steak.\n\nA half-trumpet interchange is essentially a trumpet interchange with either its loop ramp or the outer connecting ramp (but not both), and only one of its directional ramps, instead of two, designed to meet the continuous highway in one direction, usually on a 90-degree or semi-perpendicular angle. Should the need arise it can easily be upgraded into a full trumpet interchange, making it a three-way interchange. Two examples exist in Michigan: Between Main Street and M-14 in Ann Arbor, and between Edward N. Hines Drive and Ford Road (M-153).\n\nA partial-Y interchange is used where one highway terminates at another highway with the same general directional alignment (usually a maximum of sixty degrees). The trunk of the terminating highway merges with the trunk of the continuous highway; vehicles traveling into the interchange may only exit traveling in the same direction. This type of interchange is often used for bypass routes, and is named for the shape the two highways' confluence makes when drawn on a map, creating a lower-case \"y\". An example exists at the western terminus of M-14 in Michigan. Another example is the interchange between I-15 and I-84 in Ogden, Utah\n\nHybrids, variations, and rare types also exist for two-way interchanges.\nA basketweave interchange is commonly found on highways using a collector/express system or long collector/distributor lanes. In a basketweave one highway is able to interchange with itself, allowing traffic traveling in the same direction to switch between carriageways through the use of flyover/under ramps created between two carriageways without causing weaving. These interchanges usually involve left exits and entry for the outer carriageway (right in left-hand drive) but can be configured to meet on the right.\nHence the name, a controlled-access road serves a road without access control with these interchanges. Any system interchange can also be used, but this is uncommon. Rarer is a service interchange between two roads without access control, even rarer is a system interchange between two roads without access control, and rarest is a service interchange between roads with access control.\n\nA diamond interchange is an interchange involving four ramps where they enter and leave the freeway at a small angle and meet the non-freeway at almost right angles. These ramps at the non-freeway can be controlled through stop signs, traffic signals, or turn ramps.\n\nDiamond interchanges are much more economical in use of materials and land than other interchange designs, as the junction does not normally require more than one bridge to be constructed. However, their capacity is lower than other interchanges and when traffic volumes are high they can easily become congested.\n\nA dumbbell interchange is similar to the diamond interchange, but uses a pair of roundabouts to join the ramps with the non-highway. This typically increases the efficiency of the interchange when compared to a diamond.\n\nA dogbone interchange is similar to the dumbbell interchange except the roundabouts do not form a complete circle, instead having a \"raindrop\" or \"teardrop\" shape, the points facing each other. This does not impede normal traffic movement, as the eliminated portions are only useful for U-turns on the cross street.\n\nA parclo (partial cloverleaf) interchange is an interchange usually involving four to six ramps, two of which are loop ramps, which connect to the non-highway.\n\nThe parclo is a safer modification of the cloverleaf design. Depending on the number of ramps used, they take up a moderate to large amount of land and are typically inexpensive to build. Parclos with more ramps have a greater capacity and efficiency than parclos with fewer ramps. Parclos are sometimes called a folded diamonds when only four ramps, in two quadrants, are used. If the loop ramps are constructed opposite or mirrored along the highway, weaving is avoided. Cloverleaf interchanges that involve a non-highway can be changed to parclos without too much reconstruction. Although the interchange's capacity is reduced, weaving is eliminated, increasing the safety and efficiency of the interchange.\n\nA diverging diamond interchange (DDI) or double crossover diamond interchange (DCD) is similar to a traditional diamond interchange, except the non-highway lanes cross each other twice, once on each side of the highway. This allows all highway entrances and exits to avoid crossing the opposite direction of travel and saves one signal phase of traffic lights each.\n\nThe first DDIs were built in France in the 1970s. Despite the fact that such interchanges already existed, the idea for the DDI was \"reinvented\" around 2000, inspired by the former \"synchronized split-phasing\" type freeway-to-freeway interchange between Interstate 95 and I-695 north of Baltimore.\n\nThe first diverging diamond interchange in the United States opened on July 7, 2009, in Springfield, Missouri, at the junction of Interstate 44 and Missouri Route 13.\n\nA single-point urban interchange, often abbreviated to SPUI, is a modification of the diamond interchange and has its ramps meet at one point, usually on the overpass/underpass of the non-highway. This requires only one set of traffic signals, increasing its efficiency and capacity when compared to a diamond.\n\nFreeways in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area are great examples of the utilization of SPUI interchanges. Some examples of SPUI are along Arizona State Route 51 from Downtown Phoenix all the way to Loop 101, another location where SPUI is common.\n\nSome single-point \"urban\" interchanges have appeared in \"rural\" areas, such as U.S. Route 23 with State Highway 59 in the U.S. state of Michigan. Therefore, while \"single-point urban interchange\" is the most common name for this type, it is sometimes (and more accurately) called a \"single-point diamond interchange\" instead.\n\nHighway/non-highway hybrid interchanges consist of diamond and partial cloverleaf elements. Their construction can consist of multiple interchange designs such as loop ramps, flyovers, and roundabouts.\n\nOne form of the roundabout interchange can be used to connect a highway with a non-highway. It uses a single roundabout, rotary, or traffic circle which spans the highway as an over/underpass. Such junctions can be improved by adding a flyover for straight-through traffic on the non-freeway, creating the \"Roundabout interchange\".\n\nThe three-level diamond interchange is three levels high, and it handles interchanging ramps via four intersections. This kind of an interchange can also be used to connect two highways together, but due to the use of intersections, its traffic is not free-flowing.\n\n\n"}

Following the success of their stripped-down fifth studio album \"Lie of the Land\", the duo experienced attention from major publications, who praised the album, and the duo's fan base had built. Nonetheless, the duo were unable to commerce any performances in London. Their duo and their manager and producer Gerard O'Farrell took the gamble of hosting the city's historic Royal Albert Hall for a concert on 24 March 1996. The concert would be an attempt to gather all of the duo's fans and to raise the duo's profile. The duo were ridiculed for booking the hall, with many saying the performance would not sell out. Nonetheless, not only did the performance sell out, but it did so with advance orders, and it raised the duo's profile.\n\nProducer and manager Gerard O'Farrell recorded the event for a live album on the cost of £200, and the duo released it on their own label Hands on Music in August 1996. It was released to positive reviews, with one review stating that it \"stands alone as a showcase for the best of the band's repertoire over the last couple of years.\" The album became the duo's best-selling album to date, a title it would hold for many years, and had sold 4,000-5,000 copies by mid-1997. The duo have since performed at the Royal Albert Hall on three other occasions.\n\nShow of Hands became a collaboration for Devonian folk musicians Steve Knightley and Phil Beer in 1987, although the two had walked together several times before. The duo recorded the cassette-only albums \"Show of Hands\" (1987) and \"Tall Ships\" (1990) whilst Beer was still a member of The Albion Band, but Beer left The Albion Band in late 1990, allowing Show of Hands to become a full-time partnership. They recorded their last cassette-only album, \"Out for the Count\", in 1991, and formed Anglo-Chilean band Alianza with Dave Townsend with three Chilean musicians, exploring world music. Alianza released a self-titled album in 1992, becoming Knightley and Beer's first CD release. Knightley and Beer soon continued performing as a duo and, with engineer Mike Trim, recorded a performance of Show of Hands from 8 June 1992 at Bridport's Bull Hotel, and released it on The Road Goes on Forever in 1992 as \"Show of Hands Live\", the duo's first CD, but by the time of its release, the band's previous three albums were out of print, leading to it often being referred to as the band's album.\n\nThe band liked how the live album sounded and hired Mike Trim to produce their first CD studio album, \"Beat about the Bush\", released on TWAH! Records in February 1994, an album that helped build on the band's success, although \"despite Mike Trim's best efforts\", the album did not receive the radio attention it intended, and the duo simplified their sound for their subsequent album, \"Lie of the Land\", released in 1995 on Isis Records. Prior to the release of \"Lie of the Land\", the band hired Gerard O'Farrell for live performances supporting \"Beat about the Bush\", but he soon became the band's manager, and produced \"Lie of the Land\".\n\nWhilst the duo had gradually built success, \"Lie of the Land\" was seen as a major turning point, having been given attention by major publications such as \"Mojo\" and \"Q\", the latter naming it \"folk album of the year\". The duo received more attention and, by early 1996, they had by now built up a considerable fanbase through their mailing list. \nBut despite the escalating fan base, they still could not command any London gigs. Knightley, Beer and manager O’Farrell took the gamble of hiring London's famous Royal Albert Hall for a performance on the evening of 24 March 1996, in attempt to gather all of the duo's fans, and to raise the duo's profile. The duo hired the hall \"to the amusement of the media and the cynicism of sceptics\" and was considered a huge gamble. Nonetheless, the performance sold out in advance. Selling out the hall was \"unprecedented for a folk act.\" One biography said that the success \"proved that for this enigmatic, indy duo anything was possible.\" Knightley said in 1997 that \"people still talk about it in glowing terms.\" He also noted that \"quite a lot of people now know Show Of Hands as 'Those guys who did the Albert Hall'. So it's opened a lot of doors. In India there was a tremendous cachet - we were checked out by people who came to see us just because of having played the Royal Albert Hall. In America as well. So it exceeded all our expectations in that sense.\" O'Farrell commenced producing the performance as a live album, whose production work on \"Lie of the Land\" pleased the duo, who also liked the live sound of their previous live album \"Show of Hands Live\", produced by Mike Trim. The album cost £200 on the night to record.\n\nThe show took place on 24 March 1996, and featured various guest musicians. The album is slightly condensed from the performance and slightly re-arranged. The performance opened, as does the album, with \"Columbus (Didn't Find America)\", the title track of the band's 1993 extended play, written by Knightley during the duo's time with Alianza. The song is a protest song about the Spanish exploitation of the New World. The duo then performed \"Day Has Come\", a song from \"Beat about the Bush\", but the music had been re-arranged, although the lyrics stayed the same. This was followed by \"Lie of the Land\" song \"The Preacher\", non-album track \"Cutthroats, Crooks and Conmen\", and two traditional tracks, \"The Blue Cockade\", which had featured on \"Beat about the Bush\", and \"The Soldiers Joy\", at which point hints the band will play the \"one about the horses\" later, referring to \"The Galway Farmer\".\n\nThe band's long-standing live staple \"Exile\" plays next, which had recently been revisited following its re-recording on \"Lie of the Land\", followed by \"The Man in Green\", Jacques Brel's \"The Dove\", \"The Well\", \"Lie of the Land\" opening track \"The Hunter\", which briefly, near its conclusion, incorporates an excerpt of \"In the Jungle\". This is followed by \"Captains\", the traditional track \"The Blind Fiddler\", and \"Santiago\", another track that dates from the Alianza days, and features on their only album. The main set closed with \"The Galway Farmer\", which features a fast fiddle solo from Beer. The song is about is about an Irishman betting on a horse at a race at Cheltenham Racecourse and winning, despite being ridiculed beforehand. After a minute following the performance of the song after the band had left the stage, they returned to the stage to perform an encore of the Cyndi Lauper song \"Time After Time\", featuring a squeezebox.\n\nSally Barker sings backing vocals on \"Columbus (Didn't Find America)\" and \"Captains\". Vladimir Vega performs pan pipes on \"Columbus (Didn't Find America)\", including prominently in the intro of the song, as well as on \"The Hunter\" and \"Santiago\", also performing backing vocals on the latter with Matt Clifford, who also performed backing vocals on \"Columbus (Didn't Find America)\" which he also played keyboards on, as well as on \"Exile\". \"The Well\" and \"The Galway Farmer\" feature pipes from Nick Scott, accordion from Sarah Allen and whistle from Biddy Blythe, who also plays flute on \"The Galway Farmer\".\n\nThe duo themselves play a wide range of instruments. Steve Knightley sings lead vocals on all songs, aside from the instrumental \"The Soldiers Joy\", guitar on eleven of the tracks, cello-mandolin on four of the tracks, cuatro on \"The Preacher\" and concertina on \"Time After Time\". Phil Beer sings backing vocals on nine of the tracks, plays the fiddle on five of the tracks, guitar on three tracks, the cello-mandolin on four tracks, cuatro on three tracks and mandolin on \"The Hunter\".\n\nThe performance was success, and the album entered post-production in spring and summer 1996. It was released in August 1996 as the first release of the band's own label, Hands on Music, with the catalogue number HMCD01. The album is slightly condensed from the original performance and some songs are presented in a different order. \"Living Tradition\" said the album \"stands alone as a showcase for the best of the band's repertoire over the last couple of years.\" Reviewer Graham Gurrin noted \"how well it shows the duo's exceptional abilities as performers. Thinking of Phil Beer as a multi-instrumentalist has become a cliché, but just listen to him play fiddle on \"The Blind Fiddler\" as if his life depended on it, his elegant cuatro on \"Santiago\" or the subtlety of his slide guitar work on \"The Blue Cockade\". The boy is a genius, and Steve Knightley must have been bathing his tonsils in honey for weeks before the gig. His harmonies with Sally Barker on \"Captains\" should be filed under S for spine-tingling. There is a hint of over-excitement in his voice throughout, which along with the contributions of the various guests gives a bit of an edge to the performances, particularly on stompers like \"The Galway Farmer\" and \"The Hunter\",\" before praising how the album only has three tracks with the band's other live album, both albums having sixteen tracks.\n\nSteve Knightley said in a 1997 interview that despite the cost of £200 to record on the night, the album \"has been a great calling card to send festival promoters. So it exceeded all our expectations in that sense.\" It became the duo's best selling album, and was reported by Knightley in 1997 as to having sold 4,000-5,000 copies at that time.\n\nThe album is sometimes known as \"24 March 1996\", or \"24 March 1996: Show of Hands Live at the Royal Albert Hall\", due to the words displayed on the album cover. The album has been referred to as the band's best selling album to date, although this may no longer be true, and their later album \"Witness\" (2006) was reported as the duo's best-selling album. The duo subsequent album, 1997's \"Dark Fields\", continuing \"Lie of the Land's\" stripped down approach, featured a single in \"Crazy Boy\", an attempt to further the profile of the duo achieved by the Royal Albert performance. The duo played further performances at the Royal Albert Hall in 2001, 2007 and 2012. The 2001 performance was released as a VHS concert film entitled \"The Big Gig\". It was produced by Carlton who broadcast the film in two parts on television.\n\nAll songs written by Steve Knightley, except where noted.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2078240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078240", "title": "SR Q1 class", "text": "SR Q1 class\n\nThe SR Q1 class is a type of austerity steam locomotive constructed during the Second World War. The class was designed by Oliver Bulleid for use on the intensive freight turns experienced during wartime on the Southern Railway network. A total of 40 locomotives were built. Bulleid incorporated many innovations and weight-saving concepts to produce a highly functional design. The class lasted in service until July 1966, and the first member of the class, number C1, has been preserved by the National Railway Museum.\n\nThe highly unusual and controversial design represents the ultimate development of the British 0-6-0 freight engine, capable of hauling trains that were usually allocated to much larger locomotives on other railways. Nicknames for the class included \"Ugly Ducklings\", \"Coffee Pots\" , \"Charlies\", \"Biscuit Tins\", \"Biscuit Barrels\", \"Clockworks\" and \"Frankensteins\".\n\nIn late 1939, the Southern Railway, until then primarily a high-density commuter railway serving London and South-East England, much of it electrified with third-rail pick-up, found itself on the British front line of the Second World War, with a severe lack of modern freight-handling capability. The newest freight design was the Q Class 0-6-0 of 1938, the last locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell. Built to essentially Victorian era principles, these had been designed as replacements for many of the older 0-6-0s inherited by the Southern Railway in 1923, and entered service in January 1938. Maunsell, having retired at the end of October 1937, was replaced by Oliver Bulleid.\n\nThe Southern Railway became an essential strategic war-asset because of its proximity to continental Europe, and needed to equip itself with adequate freight-handling capability to transport the vast quantities of supplies and troops required for the conflict. The brief stipulated high route availability and high tractive effort.\n\nThe answer to this problem came from the drawing board of the Southern Railway's innovative Chief Mechanical Engineer, Oliver Bulleid in the shape of the Q1. Using the minimum amount of raw materials, and with all superfluous features stripped away, he produced in 1942 the most powerful 0-6-0 steam locomotive ever to run on Britain's railways. The first twenty locomotives were constructed at Brighton works and the remaining twenty at Ashford. Powerful and light, the Q1s formed the backbone of the Southern's heavy freight capability. The engine weighed less than 90 tons (90.6 tonnes) so could be used over more than 97% of the Southern Railway's route mileage.\n\nThe class was one of several built under the wartime \"austerity\" regime, which stressed pure functionality above any considerations of style or decoration. This austere approach to the design explains its functional appearance. One aspect of their shape was that, like Bulleid's SR Merchant Navy class and SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes, they could be simply driven through a coach-washer for cleaning at a time when manpower for this time-consuming chore could not be spared.\n\nThe unusual shape was also dictated by the use of materials; the lagging was made of a glass fibre insulation material known as 'Idaglass', which, although cheap and plentiful during the war years, could not support any weight, and therefore a separate casing was required which followed that seen in the Merchant Navy class locomotives, and the boiler rings were adapted to lend the lagging the support needed. A copper, rather than steel, firebox was utilised, unlike Bulleid's Pacific designs. The wheels were smaller, 5 ft 1 in (1.55 m) adaptations of the Bulleid Firth Brown type utilised on the Pacifics. The locomotive had two cylinders with Stephenson link outside admission piston valves, having a travel in full gear of and a steam lap of . It was provided with a five-nozzle blast-pipe.\n\nThe boiler design was based upon that of the \"Lord Nelson\" class, and the firebox used the same throatplate and backplate. The boiler barrel measured in length, with diameters of at the front and at the back. The grate area was , the heating surface of the 209 tubes and 21 flues was , that of the firebox was giving a total evaporative heating surface of ; the superheater heating surface was .\n\nThe Q1 was the final development of the British 0-6-0 main line steam locomotive. Later designs of medium-powered freight locomotives, such as the LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 and LMS Ivatt Class 4 Moguls, had a 2-6-0 wheel arrangement: the 0-6-0 wheel arrangement was not used in the BR Standard designs of locomotive.\n\nBR classified the Q1 class in the power classification 5F. This was unusual: few other 0-6-0s exceeded the classification of 4F. Notable exceptions were the LNER Class J20 (5F), LNER Class J39 (4P5F) and LNER Class J38 (6F). \n\nThe Q1's route availability meant that although they were primarily freight locomotives they also frequently deputised on secondary passenger services. However, the class gained a reputation for poor braking on unfitted freight trains due to the light construction of the tender braking system. \n\nThe Q1s thrived on their intended duties during World War II, and were an indispensable addition to the Southern locomotive fleet, to such an extent that they all remained in service until the 1960s, long after they were intended to cease operation as an \"austerity\" design. Withdrawals began in 1963, during the implementation of the BR Modernisation Plan which saw the end of steam operations on Britain's railways. The last example of the class was withdrawn in 1966.\n\nLivery of the Q1 Class was plain freight black, with Sunshine Yellow numbering on the cabside, and \"Southern\" lettering on the tender, shaded in green. Bulleid advocated a continental style of locomotive nomenclature, based upon his experiences at the French branch of Westinghouse Electric before the First World War, and those of his tenure in the rail operating department during that conflict. The Southern Railway number followed an adaptation of the UIC classification system where \"C\" refers to the number of coupled driving axles – in this case three. All these locomotives therefore carried numbers which started \"C\" followed by the individual identifier from C1 to C40. \nAfter nationalisation, the original Southern livery was in continued use, although with \"British Railways\" on the tender in Sunshine Yellow. From 1950 onwards, livery remained plain, although in the guise of British Railways Freight Black without lining of any description. The British Railways crest was located on the tender side. Given the British Railways power classification 5F, the locomotives were also renumbered to the British Railways' standard numbering system as 33001–33040.\n\nOnly one locomotive of the class survived into preservation. First-of-class 33001 (C1) has been preserved, and now resides at the National Railway Museum in York, where it carries its original SR livery and number. Before its return to York in 2004, the locomotive worked on the Bluebell Railway in East Sussex.\n\nThe locomotive Neville in the Thomas and Friends children's television series is based on Q1 class No. 33010.\n\n\n"}

It has been said that the area was once surrounded with a white mist, giving it a look which was rather mysterious, yet serene—much as what an emperor should be like. It has also been said that someone saw a white dragon, the symbol of the Emperor appear there, that the warlord Gongsun Shu thought this was a fortuitous sign, and so declared himself Emperor of Chengjia. Thus Gongsun was said to have founded the city, and so called himself \"the White Emperor\".\n\nThe temple complex is now on an island, due to raised water levels following the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. Many older structures were submerged, and new buildings have been built higher up. The temple complex island is linked to the north bank of the Yangtze, by a bridge. The island continues to be a tourist attraction, with many cruise ships halting for tours at Fengjie.\n\nBaidi is also known as the \"City of Poems\", because so many poets such as Li Bai wrote about it (see: \"\"). Another famous and talented poet, Du Fu, resided in Baidi for 2 or 3 years.\n\nLiu Bei, the first emperor of the Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms era, is said to have died in Baidi, although, according to Records of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei died at his palace of Yong'angong. The site of Yong'angong was located in what is now inside of the Normal School of Fengjie County, a few miles away from the current Baidicheng. Thus, as in other cases, the location of an ancient place is not necessarily the same as the location of a modern town with the same name.\n\nIn 2006, the Chinese government established Baidi Fortress as a national heritage site.\n\n"}
{"id": "2078245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078245", "title": "Baire space (set theory)", "text": "Baire space (set theory)\n\nIn set theory, the Baire space is the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers with a certain topology. This space is commonly used in descriptive set theory, to the extent that its elements are often called \"reals\". It is denoted ω, ω, N, or formula_1.\n\nThe Baire space is defined to be the Cartesian product of countably infinitely many copies of the set of natural numbers, and is given the product topology (where each copy of the set of natural numbers is given the discrete topology). The Baire space is often represented using the tree of finite sequences of natural numbers.\n\nThe Baire space can be contrasted with Cantor space, the set of infinite sequences of binary digits.\n\nThe product topology used to define the Baire space can be described more concretely in terms of trees. The basic open sets of the product topology are cylinder sets, here characterized as:\n\nUsing more formal notation, one can define the individual cylinders as\n\nfor a fixed integer location \"n\" and integer value \"v\". The cylinders are then the generators for the cylinder sets: the cylinder sets then consist of all intersections of a finite number of cylinders. That is, given any finite set of natural number coordinates formula_3 and corresponding natural number values formula_4 for each formula_5, one considers the intersection of cylinders\n\nThis intersection is called a \"cylinder set\", and the set of all such cylinder sets provides a basis for the product topology. Every open set is a countable union of such cylinder sets.\n\nBy moving to a different basis for the same topology, an alternate characterization of open sets can be obtained:\n\nThus a basic open set in the Baire space is the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers extending a common finite initial segment τ. This leads to a representation of the Baire space as the set of all infinite paths passing through the full tree ω of finite sequences of natural numbers ordered by extension. Each finite initial segment is a node of the tree of finite sequences. Each open set is determined by a (possibly infinite) union of nodes of that tree. A point in Baire space is in an open set if and only if its path goes through one of the nodes in its determining union.\n\nThe representation of the Baire space as paths through a tree also gives a characterization of closed sets. Every point in Baire space passes through a sequence of nodes of ω. Closed sets are complements of open sets. Each closed set consists of all Baire sequences that do not pass through any node that defines its complementary open set. For any closed subset \"C\" of Baire space there is a subtree \"T\" of ω such that any point \"x\" is in \"C\" if and only if \"x\" is a path through \"T\". Conversely, the set of paths through any subtree of ω is a closed set.\n\nCartesian products also have an alternate topology, the box topology. This topology is much finer than the product topology as it does not limit the indicator set formula_7 to be finite. Conventionally, Baire space does not refer to this topology; it only refers to the product topology.\n\nThe Baire space has the following properties:\n\n\nThe Baire space is homeomorphic to the set of irrational numbers when they are given the subspace topology inherited from the real line. A homeomorphism between Baire space and the irrationals can be constructed using continued fractions. That is, given a sequence formula_10, we can assign a corresponding irrational number greater than 1\n\nUsing formula_12 we get another homeomorphism from formula_13 to the irrationals in the open unit interval formula_14 and we can do the same for the negative irrationals. We see that the irrationals are the topological sum of four spaces homeomorphic to the Baire space and therefore also homeomorphic to the Baire space.\n\nFrom the point of view of descriptive set theory, the fact that the real line is connected causes technical difficulties. For this reason, it is more common to study Baire space. Because every Polish space is the continuous image of Baire space, it is often possible to prove results about arbitrary Polish spaces by showing that these properties hold for Baire space and are preserved by continuous functions.\n\nω is also of independent, but minor, interest in real analysis, where it is considered as a uniform space. The uniform structures of ω and Ir (the irrationals) are different, however: ω is complete in its usual metric while Ir is not (although these spaces are homeomorphic).\n\nThe shift operator on Baire space, when mapped to the unit interval of the reals, becomes the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator formula_15. That is, given a sequence formula_16, the shift operator T returns formula_17. Likewise, given the continued fraction formula_18, the Gauss map returns formula_19. The corresponding operator for functions from Baire space to the complex plane is the Gauss–Kuzmin–Wirsing operator; it is the transfer operator of the Gauss map. That is, one considers maps formula_20 from Baire space to the complex plane formula_21. This space of maps inherits a topology from the product topology on Baire space; for example, one may consider functions having uniform convergence. The shift map, acting on this space of functions, is then the GKW operator.\n\nThe Haar measure of the shift operator, that is, a function that is invariant under shifts, is given by the Minkowski measure formula_22. That is, one has that formula_23, where T is the shift and E any measurable subset of ω.\n\n"}

The Holocaust memorial museum is the fourth largest in the U.S., and opened in 1996.\n\nHolocaust Museum Houston is dedicated to remembering the 6 million Jews and other innocent victims of the Holocaust and honoring the legacy of the survivors. Using the lessons of the Holocaust and other genocides, they teach the dangers of hatred, prejudice and apathy. The museum promotes understanding, remembrance and education with the goal that both students and the general population stay and become aware of the lesson of these tragic events. This lesson is that humankind must strive to live together in peace and harmony.\n\nA major commitment of the Holocaust Museum Houston is education. The Boniuk Center physically and conceptually houses Holocaust Museum Houston’s Education Department. The physical space holds four classrooms, staff offices, storage rooms and a library. Holocaust Museum Houston Engines of Change Student Ambassador Program introduces Houston-area high school students to Holocaust history and enables them to better understand current issues and to develop their own informed opinions and voices. The Educator in Motion program is a free school and community outreach program that provides educational programming on the Holocaust, Genocide, Social Justice, and Active Citizenship in school and community settings. The Museum, working with colleagues from the Anti-Defamation League Southwest Region, and the Houston Police Department offers training for recruits, in-service and command-level law enforcement officers in this day-long session.

The exhibit also educates visitors about Jewish and non-Jewish resistance efforts, including the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, prisoner revolts, sabotage, the partisan movement, displaced persons camps and life after the Holocaust.\n\nWorld War II-era Railcar and the 1940s Danish Rescue Boat\n\nThe fishing boat like those used by Danish fishermen to ferry Jewish neighbors to neutral territory and the World War II-era railcar like the ones that transported Jews to concentration camps and killing centers are intentionally placed next to each other in the permanent Holocaust gallery to help teach visitors the continuing importance of each individual’s responsibility to act when confronted with injustice. As part of the Museum’s expansion, these rare artifacts were brought inside the permanent Holocaust Gallery to protect them from the elements.\n\nDimensions in Testimony\n\nUSC Shoah Foundation’s Dimensions in Testimony exhibition, featuring Houston-area Holocaust survivor William J. “Bill” Morgan, allows visitors to have “virtual conversations” with Holocaust survivors by asking questions of their HD projections who then answer in real time via pre-recorded video images. Each specially recorded interview enables viewers to ask questions of the survivor about their life experiences and hear responses in real-time, lifelike conversation. Questions are answered naturally, as if the survivor is in the room, and through AI, the more questions asked the better the technology becomes. Dimensions in Testimony is housed in the permanent Holocaust Gallery.\n\nHuman Rights Gallery\n\nThe new Human Rights Gallery will feature educational displays of all UN-recognized genocides as well as tributes to international human rights leaders including Malala Yousafzai and Martin Luther King, Jr. among others. The exhibition encourages visitors to engage with one another, and the outside world, to understand their calling relative to these social ills and the choices that one single person can make to turn the tide and combat hatred and prejudice.\n\nThe Rhona and Bruce Caress Gallery – And Still I Write: Young Diarists on War and Genocide\n\n\"And Still I Write: Young Diarists on War and Genocide\" highlights the diaries of young people who wrote during war and genocide.

Visitors will be able to access and utilize these electronic diaries, providing them with the unique use of interactive, experiential technology. In addition, the Gallery will include a historical exhibit on Anne Frank.\n\nTwo Changing Galleries\n\nThe Museum also includes two changing galleries for art and photography exhibits. The Central Gallery is naturally located in the center of the Museum building. The Josef and Edith Mincberg Gallery is a larger hall for more extensive displays. The changing exhibits are designed to complement and further explore the issues presented in the permanent galleries.\n\nLack Family Memorial Room\n\nTwo other areas of Holocaust Museum Houston allow for reflection and meditation. The Lack Family Memorial Room is a quiet place for contemplation. It contains the three-part work of art comprising the Wall of Remembrance, the Wall of Tears and the Wall of Hope. The Memorial Wall is a place where local Holocaust survivors can commemorate their lost loved ones.\n\nEric Alexander Garden of Hope\n\nOutside the Memorial Room is a quiet garden known as the Eric Alexander Garden of Hope.

{"id": "2078272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078272", "title": "Brihadaranyaka Upanishad", "text": "Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\n\nThe Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (, ) is one of the Principal Upanishads and one of the first Upanishadic scriptures of Hinduism. A key scripture to various schools of Hinduism, the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanisad\" is tenth in the Muktikā or \"canon of 108 Upanishads\".\n\nThe \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" is estimated to have been composed about 700 BCE, excluding some parts estimated to have been composed after the \"Chandogya Upanishad\". The Sanskrit language text is contained within the \"Shatapatha Brahmana\", which is itself a part of the Shukla Yajur Veda.\n\nThe \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" is a treatise on Ātman (Soul, Self), includes passages on metaphysics, ethics and a yearning for knowledge that influenced various Indian religions, ancient and medieval scholars, and attracted secondary works such as those by Adi Shankara and Madhvacharya .\n\nThe chronology of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\", like other Upanishads, is uncertain and contested. The chronology is difficult to resolve because all opinions rest on scanty evidence, an analysis of archaism, style and repetitions across texts, driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas, and on presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies. Patrick Olivelle states, \"in spite of claims made by some, in reality, any dating of these documents (early Upanishads) that attempts a precision closer than a few centuries is as stable as a house of cards\".\n\nThe chronology and authorship of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\", along with \"Chandogya\" and \"Kaushitaki Upanishads\", is further complicated because they are compiled anthologies of literature that must have existed as independent texts before they became part of these Upanishads.\n\nThe exact year, and even the century of the Upanishad composition is unknown. Scholars have offered different estimates ranging from 900 BCE to 600 BCE, all preceding Buddhism. \"Brihadaranyaka\" is one of the first Upanishads, along with that of \"Jaiminiya Upanishad\" and \"Chandogya Upanishads\". The \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" was in all likelihood composed in the earlier part of 1st millennium BCE, around 700 BCE, give or take a century or so, according to Patrick Olivelle. It is likely that the text was a living document and some verses were edited over a period of time before the 6th century BCE.\n\nThe title \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" literally means \"great wilderness or forest Upaniṣhad\". It is credited to ancient sage Yajnavalkya, but likely refined by a number of ancient Vedic scholars. The Upanishad forms the last part, that is the fourteenth \"kānda\" of \"Śatapatha Brāhmana\" of \"Śhukla Yajurveda\". The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad has six \"adhyayas\" (chapters) in total. There are two major recensions for the text - the Madhyandina and the Kanva recensions. It includes three sections: \"Madhu kānda\" (the 4th and 5th chapter of the fourteenth \"kānda\" of Satapatha Brahmana), \"Muni kānda\" (or \"Yajnavalkya Kanda\", the 6th and 7th chapter of 14th \"kānda\" of Satapatha Brahmana) and \"Khila kānda\" (the 8th and 9th chapter of the fourteenth \"kānda\" of Satapatha Brahmana).\n\nThe first and second chapters of the Upanishad's \"Madhu kānda\" consists of six brahmanas each, with varying number of hymns per brahmana. The first chapter of the Upanishad's \"Yajnavalkya kānda\" consists of nine brahmanams, while the second has six brahmanas. The \"Khila kānda\" of the Upanishad has fifteen brahmanas in its first chapter, and five brahmanas in the second chapter.\n\nThe \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" starts by stating one of many Vedic theories of creation of the universe. It asserts that there was nothing before the universe started, then Prajapati created from this nothing the universe as a sacrifice to himself, imbued it with \"Prana\" (life force) to preserve it in the form of cosmic inert matter and individual psychic energy. The world is more than matter and energy, asserts Brihadaranyaka, it is constituted also of Atman or Brahman (Soul, Self, Consciousness, Invisible Principles and Reality) as well as Knowledge.\n\nThe Brahmana 4 in the first chapter, announces the Upanishad's non-dual, monistic metaphysical premise that Atman and Brahman are identical Oneness, with the assertion that because the universe came out of nothingness when the only principle existent was \"I am he\", the universe after it came into existence continues as \"Aham brahma asmi\" (I am Brahman). In the last brahmana of the first chapter, the Upanishad explains that the Atman (soul) inspires by being self-evident (name identity), through empowering forms, and through action (work of a living being). The Soul, states Brihadaranyaka, is the imperishable one that is invisible and concealed pervading all reality.\n\nThe \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" starts the second chapter as a conversation between Ajatashatru and \"Balaki Gargya\" on theory of dreams, positing that human beings see dreams entirely unto themselves because mind draws, in itself, the powers of sensory organs, which it releases in the waking state. It then asserts that this empirical fact about dreams suggests that human mind has the power to perceive the world as it is, as well as fabricate the world as it wants to perceive it. Mind is a means, prone to flaws. The struggle man faces, asserts Brihadaranyaka in brahmana 3, is in his attempt to realize the \"true reality behind perceived reality\". That is Atman-Brahman, inherently and blissfully existent, yet unknowable because it has no qualities, no characteristics, it is \"neti, neti\" (literally, \"not this, not this\").\n\nIn fourth brahmana, the Upanishad presents a dialogue between a husband and wife, as Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi, on nature of love and spirituality, whether and how is Atman related to deep connection and bonds between human beings. Yajnavalkya states that one doesn't connect with and love forms, nor does one connect or love mind, rather one connects with the Self, the Soul of one's own and one's beloved. All love is for the sake of one's Self, and the Oneness one realizes in the Self of the beloved. He then asserts that this knowledge of the Soul, the Self, the Brahman is what makes one immortal, the connection immortal. All longing is the longing for the Soul, because Soul is the true, the immortal, the real and the infinite bliss.\n\nThe fifth brahmana of the second chapter introduces the \"Madhu theory\", thus giving this section of the Upanishad the ancient name \"Madhu Khanda\". The \"Madhu theory\" is one of the foundational principles of Vedanta schools of Hinduism, as well as other āstika schools of Indian philosophies. \"Madhu\" literally means \"honey\", or the composite fruit of numerous actions on the field of flowers. In the \"Madhu theory\", notes Paul Deussen, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad asserts that \"Atman exists\" (soul exists), that all organic beings (plants, animals, human beings and gods) are wandering souls yet One with each other and the Brahman (Cosmic Soul); it further asserts that inorganic nature (fire, air, earth, water, space) is the field where the beings act, and where their numerous actions create fruits that they separately and together experience. The Upanishad then states that everything is connected, beings affect each other, organic beings affect the inorganic nature, inorganic nature affects the organic beings, one is the \"honey\" (result, fruit, food) of the other, everyone and everything is mutually dependent, nourishing and nurturing each other, all because it came from one Brahman, because it is all one Brahman, because all existence is blissful oneness. This theory appears in various early and middle Upanishads, and parallels Immanuel Kant's doctrine of \"the affinity of phenomena\" built on \"the synthetic unity of apperception\".\n\nThe last brahmanam of the Upanishad's first section is a \"Vamsa\" (generational line of teachers) with the names of 57 Vedic scholars who are credited to have taught the \"Madhu Khanda\" from one generation to the next.\n\nThe third chapter is a metaphysical dialogue between ten ancient sages, on the nature of Reality, Atman and Mukti. Paul Deussen calls the presentation of ancient scholar Yajnavalkya in this chapter \"not dissimilar to that of Socrates in the dialogues of Plato\". Among other things, the chapter presents the theory of perceived empirical knowledge using the concepts of \"graha and atigraha\" (sensory action and sense). It lists 8 combinations of graha and atigraha: breath and smell, speech and name (ideas), tongue and taste, eye and form, ear and sound, skin and touch, mind and desire, arms and work respectively. The sages debate the nature of death, asserts the third chapter of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, and whether any graha and atigraha prevails after one dies. They rule out six, then assert that one's ideas (name) and one's actions and work (karma) continues to affect the universe.\n\nThe fourth brahmana of the third chapter asserts, \"it is your soul which is inside all\", all souls are one, immanent and transcendent. The fifth brahmana states that profound knowledge requires that one give up showing off one's erudition, then adopt childlike curiosity and simplicity, followed by becoming silent, meditating and observant (\"muni\"), thus beginning the journey towards profound knowledge, understanding the soul of things where there is freedom from frustration and sorrow. In the sixth and eighth brahmana of the third chapter in Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad is the dialogue between Gargi Vachaknavi – the female Vedic sage, and Yajñavalka, on the nature of universe.\n\nThe seventh brahmana discusses how and why the soul interconnects and has the oneness through all organic beings, all inorganic nature, all of universe. It asserts that the soul is the inner controller of beings, conflated with the interaction of nature, psyche and senses, often without the knowledge of beings. It is the soul, nevertheless, that is the true and essence, states the Upanishad. The ninth brahmana, the longest of the third chapter, introduces the \"neti, neti\" principle that is discussed later, along with the analogical equivalence of physical features of a man and those of a tree, with the root of a man being his soul. The last hymns of chapter 3 in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad also attest to the prevalent practice of the renouncing ascetic life by the time Brihadaranyaka Upanishad was composed in Vedic age of India, and it is these ascetic circles that are credited for major movements such as Yoga as well as the śramaṇa traditions later to be called Buddhism, Jainism and heterodox Hinduism.\n\nThe fourth chapter of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" starts as a dialogue between King Janaka and Yajnavalka. It explores various aspects of the \"Soul exists\" theory, its phenomenal manifestations, and its philosophical implications on soteriology. The Upanishad, in the first brahmanam of fourth chapter, states that the soul manifests in human life in six forms: \"Prajna\" (consciousness), \"Priyam\" (love and the will to live), \"Satyam\" (reverence for truth, reality), \"Ananta\" (endlessness, curiosity for the eternal), \"Ananda\" (bliss, contentness), and \"Sthiti\" (the state of enduring steadfastness, calm perseverance).\n\nIn the second brahmanam, the Upanishad explores the question, \"what happens to soul after one dies?\", and provides the root of two themes that play central role in later schools of Hinduism: one, of the concept of soul as individual souls (dualism), and second of the concept of soul being One and Eternal neither comes nor goes anywhere, because it is everywhere and everyone in Oneness (non-dualism). This chapter discusses the widely cited \"neti, neti\" (नेति नेति, \"not this, not this\") principle towards one's journey to understanding soul. The second brahmanam concludes that soul exists is self-evident, soul is blissfully free, soul is eternally invulnerable, and soul is indescribable knowledge.\n\nThe hymn 4.2.4 of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" is one of many instances in the ancient Sanskrit text where the characters involved in philosophical debate greet each other with Namaste (नमस्ते), a practice in the culture of India.\n\nThe third brahmanam of the fourth chapter discusses the premises of moksha (liberation, freedom, emancipation, self-realization), and provides some of the most studied hymns of Brihadaranyaka. Paul Deussen calls it, \"unique in its richness and warmth of presentation\", with profoundness that retains its full worth in modern times. Max Müller translates it as follows,\n\nThe fourth brahmanam continues to build the thematic description of Atman-Brahman (Self, Soul) and the state of self-realization as achieved. Yajnavalkya declares that Knowledge is Self, Knowledge is freedom, Knowledge powers inner peace. In hymn 4.4.22, the Upanishad states, \"He is that great unborn Self, who consists of Knowledge, is surrounded by the Prânas (life-force), the ether within the heart. In it [Soul] there reposes the ruler of all, the lord of all, the king of all. He does not become greater by good works, nor smaller by evil works. He is the lord of all, the king of all things, the protector of all things. He is a bank and a boundary, so that these worlds may not be confounded. He who knows him [soul], becomes a Muni. Wishing for that world, mendicants leave their homes.\"\n\nMax Müller and Paul Deussen, in their respective translations, describe the Upanishad's view of \"Soul, Self\" and \"free, liberated state of existence\" as, \"[Self] is imperishable, for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail. He is beyond good and evil, and neither what he has done, nor what he has omitted to do, affects him. (...) He therefore who knows it [reached self-realization], becomes quiet, subdued, satisfied, patient, and collected. He sees self in Self, sees all as Self. Evil does not overcome him, he overcomes all evil. Evil does not burn him, he burns all evil. Free from evil, free from spots, free from doubt, he became Atman-Brâhmana; this is the Brahma-world, O King, thus spoke Yagnavalkya.\"\n\nThe last brahmanam of the Upanishad's second section is another \"Vamsa\" (generational line of teachers) with the names of 59 Vedic scholars who are credited to have taught the hymns of \"Muni Khanda\" from one generation to the next, before it became part of Brihadaranyaka.\n\nThe fifth and sixth chapters of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" are known as \"Khila Khanda\", which literally means \"supplementary section, or appendix\". Each brahmanam in the supplement is small except the fourteenth. This section, suggests Paul Deussen, was likely written later to clarify and add ideas considered important in that later age.\n\nSome brahmanams in the last section of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\", such as the second and third brahmanam in fifth chapter, append ethical theories, while fourth brahmanam in the fifth chapter asserts that \"empirical reality and truth is Brahman\". In the fourth brahmanam of sixth chapter, sexual rituals between a husband and wife are described to conceive and celebrate the birth of a child.\n\nThe Brihadaranyaka text has been an important Upanishad to the Vedanta scholars, and discusses many early concepts and theories foundational to Hinduism such as Karma, Atman and others.\n\nOne of the earliest formulation of the Karma doctrine occurs in the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\". For example:\n\nThe \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" includes hymns on virtues and ethics. In verse 5.2.3, for example, it recommends three virtues: self-restraint (दमः, Damah), charity (दानं, Daanam), and compassion for all life (दया, Daya).\n\nThe first ethical precept of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" became the foundation of Yamas in various schools of Hinduism. In Yoga school, for example, the yamas as listed by Patañjali in Yogasūtra 2.30 are:\n\n\nThe verses in the Upanishad contain theories pertaining to psychology and human motivations. Verse 1.4.17 describes the desire for progeny as the desire to be born again. The Upanishad states a behavioral theory, linking action to nature, suggesting that behavioral habits makes a man,\n\n<poem>\nAccording as one acts, so does he become.\nOne becomes virtuous by virtuous action,\nbad by bad action.\n— Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5\n</poem>\n\nAncient and medieval Indian scholars have referred to \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" as a foundation to discuss psychological theories, the nature of psyche, and how body, mind and soul interact. For example, Adi Shankara in his commentary on the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" explains the relation between consciousness, the mind and the body.\n\nMind creates desire, asserts \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\", with its basis in pleasure. Eye is the cause of material wealth, because it is through sight that wealth is created states the Upanishad, while ears are spiritual wealth, because it is through listening that knowledge is shared. The Upanishad suggests in the dialogue between Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi, husband and wife, that one does not love an object for the sake of the object but for the sake of the subject, the Self (the soul of the other person).\n\nVerse 1.3.28 acknowledges that metaphysical statements in Upanishads are meant to guide the reader from unreality to reality. The metaphysics of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" is non-dualism (Advaita). For instance, in verse 2.4.13 Yajnavalkya asserts that everything in the universe is the Self. The nature of reality or Self is described as consciousness-bliss in verse 3.9.28. Neti-neti or (not this—not this) is a method of emphasizing the discovery of the right, by excluding the wrong. The verse 5.1.1 states that the Universe, Reality and Consciousness is infinite.\n\n\"From infinite or fullness, we can get only fullness or infinite\". The above verse describes the nature of the Absolute or Brahman which is infinite or full, i.e., it contains everything. Upanishadic metaphysics is further elucidated in the Madhu-vidya (honey doctrine), where the essence of every object is described to be same to the essence of every other object. The \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" looks at reality as being indescribable and its nature to be infinite and consciousness-bliss. The cosmic energy is thought to integrate in the microcosm and in the macrocosm integrate the individual to the universe.\n\nThe Brihadaranyaka Upanishad has attracted secondary literature and commentaries (\"bhasya\") from many scholars. In these secondary texts, the same passages have been interpreted in different ways by the various sub-schools of Vedanta such as nondualistic Advaita (monism), dualistic Dvaita (theism) and qualified nondualistic Vishistadvaita.\n\nThe Pavamana Mantra is from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (1.3.28)\n\nTranslation:\n\n\nPoet T. S. Eliot makes use of the story \"The Voice of the Thunder\" and for the source of \"\"datta\", \"dayadhvam\", and \"damyata\" found in the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\". Sections of the story appear in his poem \"The Waste Land\" under .\n\n"}
{"id": "2078276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078276", "title": "SR V Schools class", "text": "SR V Schools class\n\nThe SR V class, more commonly known as the \"Schools\" class, is a class of steam locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell for the Southern Railway. The class was a cut down version of his \"Lord Nelson\" class but also incorporated components from Urie and Maunsell's LSWR/SR \"King Arthur\" class. It was the last locomotive in Britain to be designed with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement, and was the most powerful class of 4-4-0 ever produced in Europe. All 40 of the class were named after English public schools, and were designed to provide a powerful class of intermediate express passenger locomotive on semi-fast services for lines which could cope with high axle loads but some of which had short turntables. Because of the use of a ‘’King Arthur’’ firebox, rather than the square-topped Belpaire firebox used on the Lord Nelsons, the class could be used on lines with a restricted loading gauge and some of the best performance by the class was on the heavily restricted Tonbridge to Hastings line. The locomotives performed well from the beginning but were subject to various minor modifications to improve their performance over the years. The class operated until 1961 when mass withdrawals took place and all had gone by December 1962. Three examples are now preserved on heritage railways in Britain.\n\nBy 1928 the Southern Railway was well served by large 4-6-0 express passenger locomotives, but there was an urgent need for a class to fulfill intermediate roles throughout the system. Maunsell’s previous attempt at developing his predecessor’s L class for this task had proven a disappointment, and the Drummond D15 and L12 classes were approaching the end of their useful lives on these services. An entirely new secondary express passenger locomotive was required to operate over the main lines throughout the system including those that had relatively short turntables.\n\nMaunsell’s original plan was to use large-wheeled 2-6-4 tank engines for this purpose, but the Sevenoaks railway accident made him have second thoughts. He therefore chose a relatively short wheelbase 4-4-0 design although by this period 4-6-0 was more usual for this type of work. Authorities disagree as to whether Maunsell had in mind the restricted loading gauge of the Tonbridge to Hastings line when he designed the class, or whether this was an \"unexpected bonus\" when he was forced to substitute a \"King Arthur\" round-topped firebox to his planned Belpaire design to reduce the axle load on the driving wheels to acceptable limits. In either event the class was undoubtedly Maunsell’s most immediately successful design, and the locomotives did some of their best work on the Hastings route.\n\nThe basic layout of the class was influenced by the existing ‘’Lord Nelson’’ class 4-6-0 design, but the use of the round topped firebox enabled Maunsell to design the cab's curved profile to fit the gauge restrictions of the Hastings line while allowing adequate forward visibility. The short frame length of the 4-4-0 locomotive also meant very little overhang on the line's tight curves. To maintain the high power rating required for express passenger engines, Maunsell opted for a three-cylinder design. In terms of tractive effort, the class was the most powerful 4-4-0 ever built in Britain, and were the only 4-4-0 type to be given the power classification of 5P by British Railways. They were well liked by crews. They also had a higher tractive effort than the nominally more powerful King Arthur class 4-6-0s, but at the cost of high axle-loading: . The permanent way on the Hastings line therefore had to be upgraded during 1929 and 1930 to accept the new locomotive.\n\nPermission was granted for the first batch of fifteen locomotives in March 1928, but this was reduced to ten when it became apparent that they would not immediately be able to operate on the Hastings route. Production delays at Eastleigh railway works meant that they were not delivered until between March and July 1930. Once the original batch had proved their worth and had been well received by the crews a further twenty locomotives were ordered in March 1931 for delivery between December 1932 and March 1934. A third batch of twenty were ordered from Eastleigh in March 1932 for delivery after the completion of the previous order, but this was subsequently reduced to ten locomotives because of the continuing trade depression. The final locomotive in the class was delivered in July 1935.\n\n\"For location details and current status of the preserved locomotives including surviving artifacts of scrapped class members, see: List of SR V \"Schools\" class locomotives\"\n\nThe Southern Railway continued its 1923 naming policy for express passenger locomotives with this class. As several public schools were located on the Southern Railway network, the locomotives were named after them. This was another marketing success for both railway and schools concerned, continuing in the tradition of the N15 \"King Arthur\" and \"Lord Nelson\" classes.\n\nWhere possible, the Southern sent the newly constructed locomotive to a station near the school after which it was named for its official naming ceremony, when pupils were allowed to view the cab of \"their\" engine. Extension of the class meant that names from \"foreign\" schools outside the Southern Railway catchment area were used, including Rugby and Malvern.\n\nThe class performed well from the outset, but there were a number of minor modifications over the years. The first ten were built without smoke deflectors, but these were added from August 1931, and the remaining thirty were fitted with them from new. Following the successful introduction of the Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes on to the \"Lord Nelson\" class, Maunsell's successor Oliver Bulleid began to fit them to the \"Schools\" class. However no discernible improvement to draughting was experienced, and only twenty examples were so modified, the most obvious change in their appearance being the large diameter chimney.\n\nThe original ten locomotives were shared between Dover for use on the South Eastern Main Line and Eastbourne for London expresses. Several of the former later transferred to Ramsgate. By mid 1931 they began to be used on the Hastings services and as more locomotives became available later that year they also appeared on Portsmouth expresses. After the electrification of the London to Eastbourne and the London to Portsmouth routes in the late 1930s the class also began to be used from Bournemouth. Under British Railways they were also widely used on cross-country trains from Brighton to Cardiff and Exeter and on the Newhaven Boat Trains. Two locomotives (30902 and 30921) were briefly supplied with \"Lord Nelson\" tenders for use on the longer runs of the Western Section.\n\nThe class was frequently regarded by locomotive crews as the finest constructed by the Southern Railway up to 1930, and could turn in highly spectacular performances for its size. The fastest recorded speed for these locomotives was , achieved near Wool railway station in 1938 by 928 \"Stowe\" pulling a four coach train from Dorchester to Wareham. However, there was a drawback with such high power and relatively low weight; when starting the locomotive from a standstill, wheelslips frequently occurred, calling for skilled handling on the footplate. The factor of adhesion, unusually, is below the usual design target of 4 although the smoother power delivery of the 3-cylinder layout compensates for this to some extent.\n\nThe reception given by footplate crews was such that more of the class were constructed for other parts of the network, although the electrification of the Southern's Eastern Section meant that they were dispersed from their original stamping grounds.\n\nThe introduction of British Rail Class 201 diesel-electric multiple units to the Hastings route after 1957 and the completion of the electrification of the South Eastern Main Line in 1961 deprived the class of much of their work. Withdrawals began in January 1961 and the whole class had disappeared from service by December 1962.\n\n\nWhen built, the \"Schools\" Class were outshopped in Maunsell's darker version of the LSWR passenger sage green livery lined in black and white, with cabside numberplates and \"Southern\" and the loco number on the tender in yellow. Later adaptations of the Southern Railway livery following Bulleid's arrival as Chief Mechanical Engineer entailed Malachite Green livery, again with \"Sunshine Yellow\" picking out the numbers and \"Southern\" on the tender (during the Second World War the locomotives were painted black with yellow lettering and numbers). The smoke deflectors – a later addition – were also treated with this livery. Numbers allocated to the locomotives were 900–939.\n\nInitial livery after nationalisation in 1948 was modified Southern Railway malachite green and sunshine yellow with 'British Railways' on the tender, and the Southern numbering system was temporarily retained with an \"S\" prefix, e.g. S900. Following this the locomotives were repainted British Railways mixed traffic lined black and given the power classification 5P, as only the larger passenger locos were painted green. This choice of livery proved an unpopular decision considering the locomotives' duties, and they were subsequently outshopped in British Railways brunswick green livery with orange and black lining as they became due for overhaul. By this stage the class had been renumbered under standard British Railways procedure, from 30900 to 30939.\n\nThree members of the class have been preserved.\n\nLoco numbers in bold mean their current number.\n\n\n\nThe erstwhile Kitmaster company produced an unpowered polystyrene injection moulded model kit for 00 gauge, which went on sale in March 1959. In late 1962, the Kitmaster brand was sold by its parent company (Rosebud Dolls) to Airfix, who transferred the moulding tools to their own factory; they re-introduced some of the former Kitmaster range, including the Schools class locomotive in May 1968. In time, the moulding tools passed on to Dapol who have also produced the model kit. Crownline Models produce an etched chassis kit\nto permit this model to be motorised.\n\nHornby produce a super-detail and a cheaper railroad version based on their old tender drive OO gauge model of the Schools Class.\n\nMettoy produced an O Gauge clockwork model of the Eton 900.\n\nHornby produced an O Gauge model of Eton in 1937, both clockwork and electric versions being available.\n\nDapol produce an N gauge model Schools with several name versions.\n\n\n"}

Gujarat, Sikkim, Chhattisgarh and a unit in Central University of Jammu are newly formed committees. SFI is leading several student unions of universities in Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal, Tripura, Assam, Odisha, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,Bihar and Kerala.\n\n\nFrom 27–29 January 2017, the 5th All India Girls Convention was held at Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh and it elected a 23 member team of girls’ sub-committee. \n\nProtesting against the imposition of 12% tax on sanitary napkins, the women sub-committee of SFI protested nationwide in July 2017. The campaign was named \"Bleed Without Fear, Bleed Without Tax\". Petitions were submitted to the Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for revoking the government decision. Thousands of girl students mailed sanitary napkins with protest slogans to Arun Jaitley's office. This campaign was similar to that of the Pink Chaddi Campaign in 2009. The campaign also demanded the installation of adequate sanitary napkin vending machines in schools and colleges and providing six packets of sanitary napkins for one rupee to the women below poverty line.\n\nFemale candidates of the SFI won all seats in a mixed college by fielding an all-women panel for students union elections in Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady in 2017. An SFI member became the first Dalit woman to be elected as the chairperson in Maharaja's College, Ernakulam in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, all-women SFI panels won in CMS College Kottayam and contested in Government Victoria College, Palakkad.\n\nIn 2019, SFI members were elected as the first female chairpersons in Sacred Heart College, Thevara, Kochi, and the College of Engineering, Trivandrum (CET). Earlier, the SFI had organised protests of the female hostelites of CET in February 2019 for extending the curfew timings for girls' hostels. This movement forced the government to accept the demands and Dr Usha Titus, the Higher Education Secretary of Kerala Government issued orders to enforce them.\n\nThe idea of GSCASH (Gender Sensitisation Committee Against Sexual Harassment) was first experimented in Jawaharlal Nehru University by SFI's students union headed by Vijoo Krishnan in 1998–99. In September 2013, after the harassment of two women students of Pondicherry University, the SFI initiated a movement for GSCASH in the university and the activists approached Madras High Court for redressal. The movement later ended successfully with the High Court ordering university to constitute institutional mechanisms for grievances. In Assam, the Directorate of Higher Education (DHE) in 2018 ordered all colleges to set up GSCASH after the SFI's intervention.\n\nIn 2019, an informal probe by retired Justice PK Shamsudin, appointed by Indian National Congress for looking into the discrepancies in college campus politics noted the anti-democratic activities of SFI in Kerala. However, the SFI denied these claims.\n"}
{"id": "2078286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078286", "title": "Second strike", "text": "Second strike\n\nIn nuclear strategy, a second-strike capability is a country's assured ability to respond to a nuclear attack with powerful nuclear retaliation against the attacker. To have such an ability (and to convince an opponent of its viability) is considered vital in nuclear deterrence, as otherwise the other side might attempt to try to win a nuclear war in one massive first strike against its opponent's own nuclear forces.\n\nThe possession of second-strike capabilities counters a first-strike nuclear threat and can support a no first use nuclear strategy. Reciprocal second-strike capabilities usually cause a mutual assured destruction defence strategy, though one side may have a lower level minimal deterrence response.\n\nSecond-strike capabilities can be further strengthened by implementing fail-deadly mechanisms. These mechanisms create a threshold and guaranteed consequences if that threshold is breached. For instance, a threshold may be for an allied nation not to be attacked. If a rival nation then breaches this threshold by attacking the allied nation, then the predetermined consequences for this action go into effect. These predetermined consequences could include a wide range of responses, including a retaliatory nuclear second strike.\n\nThe crucial goal in maintaining second-strike capabilities is preventing first-strike attacks from taking out a nation's nuclear arsenal. In this manner, a country can carry out nuclear retaliation even after absorbing a nuclear attack. The United States and other countries have diversified their nuclear arsenals through the nuclear triad in order to better ensure second-strike capability.\n\nSubmarine-launched ballistic missiles are the traditional, but very expensive, method of providing a second strike capability, though they need to be supported by a reliable method of identifying who the attacker is. Using SLBMs as a second-strike capability has a serious problem, because in retaliation for a submarine-launched ICBM, the wrong country could be targeted, and can cause a conflict to escalate. However, implementation of second strikes is crucial to deter a first strike. Countries with nuclear weapons make it their primary purpose to convince their opponents that a first strike is not worth facing a second strike. Such countries have many diverse launch mechanisms, prepared responses to various nuclear attack scenarios, launch mechanisms in many different areas of the country, and underground launch facilities that are specifically designed to withstand a nuclear attack.\n\nLaunch on warning is a strategy of nuclear weapon retaliation that gained recognition during the Cold War between the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc.\nIn addition to the nuclear triad, nations deploy an early warning system that detects incoming nuclear missiles. This gives that nation the capability and option to launch a retaliatory second strike before the incoming nuclear first strike hits any of its targets. This is another method of solidifying second-strike capabilities and deterring a first strike from another nuclear power.\n\nBecause of the low accuracy (circular error probable) of early-generation intercontinental ballistic missiles (and especially submarine-launched ballistic missiles), second strike was initially only possible against very large, undefended countervalue targets like cities. Later-generation missiles with much improved accuracy made second-strike counterforce attacks against the opponent's hardened military facilities possible.\n\nPerimetr-PTS, otherwise known as мертвая рука (the Dead Hand) within Russia, is a Russian nuclear deterrence developed to automatically launch ballistic missiles as a retaliatory attack in the event that the Russian command and control system is destroyed in a surprise decapitation strike.\n\nPerimetr PTS dates back to 1974, in response to Soviet fears of devastating nuclear strikes from US Ballistic Missile submarines. It became operational in January 1985, with SS-17 launch silos in Vypolzovo (Yedrovo) and Kostroma, each 100 and 150 miles north-west of Moscow respectively. The system was built with multiple layers of redundancy, in case multiple layers of communications were destroyed in the initial strike. Launch authorization would be transmitted by UHF radio, by transmitters buried deep underground. Development continued over the years with the system incorporating the new RT-2PM2 Topol-M ICBMs in December 1990, and further refinements in 1996.\n\nRussian leadership was concerned that the system could trigger an accidental launch, so they incorporated numerous safeguards into its design.\n\nDespite the automated launch capabilities, Russian nuclear command and control could order missiles to self-destruct mid-flight in the event of an accidental launch. Russian Ballistic Missile submarines were reportedly never incorporated into Perimetr-PTS, given the inherent communication issues which could ensue.\n\nAs early as 1940, science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein wrote the science fiction short story \"Solution Unsatisfactory\" in which he described a nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. In one episode, the US cabinet discusses the scenario of a Soviet surprise attack in which American cities would be destroyed, but the US armed forces would survive and launch a counter-attack.\n\n"}

Introduced in 1911, and designed by John G. Robinson, 126 were built for the GCR prior to the First World War. Including wartime construction for the British Army ROD and the post-war GCR Class 8M, the class and its derivatives totalled 666 locomotives.\n\nThe first of the 8K class was outshopped from the GCR's Gorton workshops in 1911. It was essentially a superheated version of an earlier 0-8-0, the 8A class, with the addition of a pony truck. This both supported the greater front end weight and gave a steadier ride. The 8K was introduced to anticipate the increased traffic from the GCR's vast new docks complex at Immingham in North East Lincolnshire and by June 1914 126 were in traffic. During the First World War there were experiments with oil burning 8Ks with larger bogie tenders.\n\nPost-war, a further 19 locomotives were built in 1918–21 to a modified design with a larger boiler (GCR class 8M). In 1922 the GCR rebuilt two Class 8M to Class 8K.\n\nRobust and straightforward, the Class 8K 2-8-0 steamed well and proved outstandingly reliable, qualities that commended the design to the Ministry of Munitions. Sir Sam Fay ensured that it became the standard locomotive during the First World War as the ROD 2-8-0, used by the Railway Operating Division of the Royal Engineers. 521 ROD locomotives were built in 1917-19 to essentially the same design as the GCR's 8K locomotives, differing only in minor details, such as the fitting of Westinghouse Air Brakes and the use of steel for the boiler tubes and inner firebox. After the war, the surviving ROD locomotives were sold to various railway companies, with the GCR itself purchasing 3 in 1919, which were added to its indigenous 8K fleet.\n\nOther surplus ROD locomotives were sold to the London and North Western Railway (30 locomotives), its successor the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (75 locomotives, see LMS ex-ROD 2-8-0), the Great Western Railway (100 locomotives, see GWR 3000 Class), and to various purchasers in Australia and China. Many of these had short lives with their new owners – the LMS locomotives were all scrapped or sold by the 1930s, and half of the GWR fleet was gone by 1930. However, other GWR engines survived well into the 1950s. The last of 13 locomotives sold to J & A Brown for use on the Richmond Vale railway line, in Australia, was retired in 1973, and 3 locomotives in China were only retired in 1990.\n\nUpon its formation in 1923 the London and North Eastern Railway inherited a total of 131 class 8K and 17 class 8M locomotives from the Great Central Railway. Under the LNER's ownership the 8Ks became known as Class O4, and the 8Ms as Class O5, although all of the O5s were converted to Class O4s by 1946. They were joined by a further 273 former ROD locomotives purchased in 1923-27, bringing the total LNER O4 fleet to 421 locomotives. Some 92 of these were requisitioned by the War Department in 1941 for use in support of Commonwealth forces in the Middle East, none of which would return to Britain.\n\nThe O4 locos served widely throughout the LNER system, many being modified to help extend their useful working life on heavy freight trains. Fifty-eight of the class were rebuilt into LNER Thompson Class O1s in 1944-49. 329 LNER O4 locomotives passed to British Railways ownership in 1948. Five locomotives were sold to the Government in 1952 for use in Egypt, and routine withdrawals of BR's class O4s commenced in December 1958. The last examples of the class were withdrawn from operations in the Doncaster area in April 1966, not long before the abandonment of steam altogether.\n\nOne of the GCR-built 8Ks, BR number 63601 (originally GCR No. 102 built at Gorton in 1912), is preserved in Great Britain where it runs on the preserved Great Central Railway at Loughborough. There are also three ROD 2-8-0s (not used by the GCR or LNER) in New South Wales, Australia. Two are stored at the Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum and one is being restored on the Richmond Vale Railway.\n\nIn 2009 Bachmann Branchline announced a ready-to-run '00' scale model of the Class 8K, marketing it under the LNER class name of O4. The models being of preserved 63601, and 2 long-gone examples BR 63635 and LNER 6190, -these have since been released.\n\nIn October 2012 RailSimulator.com released a pay-ware add-on of the GCR 8K, again marketed under its LNER O4 classification, for Train Simulator 2013. It was released as a companion to the Woodhead Line add-on, released earlier in the year, and features sounds from the preserved O4 63601 before its boiler ticket ran out, and includes 4 scenarios for the Woodhead Line and Quickdrive compatibility.\n\nIn May of 2019, a new payware version of the GCR 8K was released for Train Simulator. It was released covering multiple variants of the locomotive. Including the GCR 8K, GWR 3000, LNER 04, LNWR ROD, CR ROD and the ROD version itself. The pack included a few Scenarios for the LNER 04 and GWR 3000 classes.\n\n"}

These rules were based on those drafted by England's Jack Broughton in 1743 and governed the conduct of prizefighting/bare-knuckle boxing for over 100 years. They \"introduced measures that remain in effect for professional boxing to this day, such as outlawing butting, gouging, scratching, kicking, hitting a man while down, holding the ropes, and using resin, stones or hard objects in the hands, and biting.\" They were later superseded by the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, the origins of the modern sport of boxing.\n\nFights under these rules were often contested with bare knuckles. The rules also allowed for a broad range of fighting including holds and throws of the opponent. Spiked shoes, within limits, were also allowed. Also included were provisions dealing with how wagers would be resolved if various events such as interference by the law, darkness, or cancellations occurred. In contrast with modern boxing rules based upon the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, a round ended with a man downed by punch or throw, whereupon he was given 30 seconds to rest and eight additional seconds to \"come to scratch\" or return to the centre of the ring where a \"scratch line\" was drawn and square off with his opponent once more.\nConsequently, there were no round limits to fights. When a man could not come to scratch, he would be declared loser and the fight would be brought to a halt. Fights could also end if broken up beforehand by crowd riot, police interference or chicanery, or if both men were willing to accept that the contest was a draw. While fights could have enormous numbers of rounds, the rounds in practice could be quite short with fighters pretending to go down from minor blows to take advantage of the 30-second rest period.\n\nFamous fighters of prize ring include William \"Bendigo\" Thompson, Tom Cribb, Jack Broughton, James \"Deaf\" Burke, \"Professor\" Mike Donovan, Tom Allen, Samuel \"Dutch Sam\" Elias, John \"Gentleman\" Jackson, the \"Benicia Boy\" John Carmel Heenan, Daniel Mendoza, Tom Molineaux, John \"Old Smoke\" Morrisey, Tom Sayers, Owen Swift, the \"Trojan Giant\" Paddy Ryan, Joe Goss, and James \"Yankee Sullivan\" Ambrose, Arhan \"Hanuman Dragon\" Deshmukh. England's last prize ring great was \"gypsy\" Jem Mace, and America's was John L. Sullivan—both men fought under both sets of rules, with and without gloves and are considered bridges to the modern era of boxing.\n\nJohn L. Sullivan is the last fighter to have won a \"world\" championship under the London Prize Ring Rules in 1882 against Paddy Ryan and was the last champion to defend a title under the rules in 1889 against Jake Kilrain.\n\nThe rules of 1853 (which were somewhat different from the rules of 1838) were as follows:\n\n"}

{"id": "2078359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078359", "title": "Petroleum coke", "text": "Petroleum coke\n\nPetroleum coke, abbreviated coke or petcoke, is a final carbon-rich solid material that derives from oil refining, and is one type of the group of fuels referred to as cokes. Petcoke is the coke that, in particular, derives from a final cracking process—a thermo-based chemical engineering process that splits long chain hydrocarbons of petroleum into shorter chains—that takes place in units termed coker units. (Other types of coke are derived from coal.) Stated succinctly, coke is the \"carbonization product of high-boiling hydrocarbon fractions obtained in petroleum processing (heavy residues).\" Petcoke is also produced in the production of synthetic crude oil (syncrude) from bitumen extracted from Canada’s oil sands and from Venezuela's Orinoco oil sands.\n\nIn petroleum coker units, residual oils from other distillation processes used in petroleum refining are treated at a high temperature and pressure leaving the petcoke after driving off gases and volatiles, and separating off remaining light and heavy oils. These processes are termed \"coking processes\", and most typically employ chemical engineering plant operations for the specific process of delayed coking.\n\nThis coke can either be fuel grade (high in sulfur and metals) or anode grade (low in sulfur and metals). The raw coke directly out of the coker is often referred to as green coke. In this context, \"green\" means unprocessed. The further processing of green coke by calcining in a rotary kiln removes residual volatile hydrocarbons from the coke. The calcined petroleum coke can be further processed in an anode baking oven to produce anode coke of the desired shape and physical properties. The anodes are mainly used in the aluminium and steel industry.\n\nPetcoke is over 80% carbon and emits 5% to 10% more carbon dioxide (CO) than coal on a per-unit-of-energy basis when it is burned. As petcoke has a higher energy content, petcoke emits between 30 and 80 percent more CO than coal per unit of weight. The difference between coal and coke in CO production per unit of energy produced depends upon the moisture in the coal, which increases the CO per unit of energy – heat of combustion – and on the volatile hydrocarbons in coal and coke, which decrease the CO per unit of energy.\n\nThere are at least four basic types of petroleum coke, namely, needle coke, honeycomb coke, sponge coke and shot coke. Different types of petroleum coke have different microstructures due to differences in operating variables and nature of feedstock. Significant differences are also to be observed in the properties of the different types of coke, particularly ash and volatile matter contents.\n\nNeedle coke, also called acicular coke, is a highly crystalline petroleum coke used in the production of electrodes for the steel and aluminium industries and is particularly valuable because the electrodes must be replaced regularly. Needle coke is produced exclusively from either fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) decant oil or coal tar pitch.\n\nHoneycomb coke is an intermediate coke, with ellipsoidal pores that are uniformly distributed. Compared to needle coke, honeycomb coke has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion and a lower electrical conductivity.\n\nPetcoke, altered through the process of calcined which it is heated or refined raw coke eliminates much of the component of the resource. Usually petcoke when refined does not release the heavy metals as volatiles or emissions.\n\nDepending on the petroleum feed stock used, the composition of petcoke may vary but the main thing is that it is primarily carbon. Petcoke is primarily made up of carbon, when in pure form petcoke can weigh 98-99% which creates a carbon based compound with the hydrogen filling in. In raw form hydrogen can have a weight range of 3.0- 4.0%. Petcoke in its raw(green coke) nitrogen at 0.1- 0.5% and sulfur 0.2- 6.0% become emissions after the coke calcined.\nThrough process of thermal processing the composition in weight is reduced with the volatile matter and sulfur being emitted. This process ends in the honeycomb petcoke which according to the name giving is a solid carbon structure with holes in it.\nDepending on the petroleum feed stock used, the composition of petcoke may vary but the main thing is that it is primarily carbon. Petcoke is primarily made up of carbon, when in pure form petcoke can weigh 98-99% which creates a carbon based compound with the hydrogen filling in. In raw form hydrogen can have a weight range of 3.0- 4.0%. Petcoke in its raw(green coke) nitrogen at 0.1- 0.5% and sulfur 0.2- 6.0% become emissions after the coke calcined.\n\nOther heavy metals found can be found with in petcoke as impurities due to that some of these metals come in after processing as volatile.\n\nFuel-grade coke is classified as either sponge coke or shot coke morphology. While oil refiners have been producing coke for over 100 years, the mechanisms that cause sponge coke or shot coke to form are not well understood and cannot be accurately predicted. In general, lower temperatures and higher pressures promote sponge coke formation. Additionally, the amount of heptane insolubles present and the fraction of light components in the coker feed contribute.\n\nWhile its high heat and low ash content make it a decent fuel for power generation in coal-fired boilers, petroleum coke is high in sulfur and low in volatile content, and this poses environmental (and technical) problems with its combustion. Its gross calorific value (HHV) is nearly 8000 Kcal/kg which is twice the value of average coal used in electricity generation. A common choice of sulfur recovering unit for burning petroleum coke is the SNOX Flue gas desulfurisation technology, which is based on the well-known WSA Process. Fluidized bed combustion is commonly used to burn petroleum coke. Gasification is increasingly used with this feedstock (often using gasifiers placed in the refineries themselves).\n\nCalcined petroleum coke (CPC) is the product from calcining petroleum coke. This coke is the product of the coker unit in a crude oil refinery. The calcined petroleum coke is used to make anodes for the aluminium, steel and titanium smelting industry. The green coke must have sufficiently low metal content to be used as anode material. Green coke with this low metal content is called anode-grade coke. When green coke has excessive metal content, it is not calcined and is used as fuel-grade coke in furnaces.\n\nA high sulfur content in petcoke reduces its market value, and may preclude its use as fuel due to restrictions on sulfur oxides emissions for environmental reasons. Methods have thus been proposed to reduce or eliminate the sulfur content of petcoke. Most of them involve the desorption of the inorganic sulfur present in the pores or surface of the coke, and the partition and removal of the organic sulfur attached to the aromatic carbon skeleton.\n\nPotential petroleum desulfurization techniques can be classified as follows:\n\nAs of 2011 there was no commercial process available to desulfurize petcoke.\n\nNearly pure carbon, petcoke is a potent source of carbon dioxide if burned.\n\nPetroleum coke may be stored in a pile near an oil refinery pending sale. For example, in 2013 a large stockpile owned by Koch Carbon near the Detroit River was produced by a Marathon Petroleum refinery in Detroit which had begun refining bitumen from the oil sands of Alberta in November 2012. Large stockpiles of petcoke also existed in Canada as of 2013, and China and Mexico were markets for petcoke exported from California to be used as fuel. As of 2013 Oxbow Corporation, owned by William I. Koch, was a major dealer in petcoke, selling 11 million tons annually.\n\nIn 2017 a quarter of US exports of the fuel went to India, an Associated Press investigation found. In 2016 this amounted to more than eight million metric tons, more than 20 times as much as in 2010. India's Environmental Pollution Control Authority tested imported petcoke in use near New Delhi, and found sulfur levels 17 times the legal limit.\n\nThe International Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78), adopted by the IMO, has mandated that marine vessels shall not consume residual fuel oils (bunker fuel, etc) with a sulfur content greater than 0.5% from the year 2020. Nearly 38% of residual fuel oils are consumed in the shipping sector. In the process of converting excess residual oils into lighter oils by coking processes, pet coke is generated as a byproduct. Pet coke availability is expected to increase in the future due to falling demand for residual oil. Pet coke is also used in methanation plants to produce synthetic natural gas, etc. in order to avoid a pet coke disposal problem.\n\nPetroleum coke is sometimes a source of fine dust, which can penetrate the filtering process of the human airway, lodge in the lungs and cause serious health problems. Studies have shown that petroleum coke itself has a low level of toxicity and there is no evidence of carcinogenicity.\n\nPetroleum coke can contain vanadium, a toxic metal. Vanadium was found in the dust collected in occupied dwellings near the petroleum coke stored next to the Detroit River. Vanadium is toxic in tiny quantities, 0.8 micrograms per cubic meter of air, according to the EPA.\n\nAccording to multiple EPA studies and analyses, petroleum coke has a low health hazard potential in humans. It does not have any observable carcinogenic, developmental, or reproductive effects. During animal case studies repeated-dose chronic inhalation did show respiratory inflammation due to dust particles, but not specific to petroleum coke.\n\nEnvironmental concerns stem from the storage and combustion of petcoke. By-waste accumulates as petcoke is processed, making waste management an issue. Petcoke's high silt content of 21.2% increases the risk of fugitive dust drifting away from petcoke mounds under heavy wind. An estimated 100 tons of petcoke fugitive dust including PM10 and PM2.5 are released into the atmosphere per year in the United States. Waste management and release of fugitive dust is especially an issue in the cities of Chicago, Detroit and Green bay.\n\nExternalities stem from petcoke that cause potential environmental impacts. Petcoke is composed of 90% elemental carbon by weight which is converted to during combustion. Use of petcoke also produces emissions of sulfur, and the potential for water pollution through nickel and vanadium runoff from refining and storage.\n\n\n"}

His early involvement in Sunday School teaching led him to believe in the importance of effective training for teachers at all levels. His motto was \"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.\"\n\nA leader of considerable ability and energy, in 1828, Stow set up his first day school in New City Road, Cowcaddens, Glasgow. Its success led to the establishment of the influential Glasgow Educational Society. In 1836, Stow established a \"Normal School\" for teacher training. The name was derived from the French word 'norma' meaning a rule or system. The Normal School existed to train teachers not to provide them with an education. Stow believed that his students should already possess the necessary education and knowledge of the curriculum they intended to teach. The school attracted students and observers from across the UK, including James Phillips Kay-Shuttleworth, education in England still being comparatively undeveloped at that stage. Teachers trained in Stow’s ‘system’ were sent out to schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Colonies taking his approach across the world. \n\nStow's school became part of the establishment and, following the Disruption of 1843, a legal ruling of 1845 held that the school was part of the Church of Scotland. Stow and most of his colleagues and students were adherents of the Free Church of Scotland; for this reason, they were compelled to resign from what had become state-funded teaching posts. Stow established a new college in Glasgow as the Free Church Normal Seminary.\n\nThe Glasgow System had been named \"The Training System\" by Stow. The system originated during the controversy over Bell-Lancaster method. Gladman, citing the British and Foreign School Society handbook, wrote \"Failure occurred, as it always will, when masters were slaves to \"the system,\" when they were satisfied with mechanical arrangements and routine work, or when they did not study their pupils, and get down to Principles of Education.\" \n\nGladman goes on to write that Stow, a young merchant, who, in his anxiety to \"stem the torrent of vice and ungodliness, turned his attention to the young,\" and established a school on Sabbath evenings in the Saltmarket, \"the very St. Giles of Glasgow,\" in 1816. Gladman writes that Stow realised that the training of the street was more important than any individual. Adding to the institution Stow had started, he also formalised his method. \"The Training System cultivates the whole nature of the child, instead of the mere head - the affections and habits, as well as the intellect.\"\n\n\"The peculiarities of the Training System may be stated in one sentence, as - Picturing out in words, direct moral training, with suitable premises, and various practical methods by which these objects are accomplished, under well instructed and well trained masters or mistresses.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

He also played an important role during the First World War as part of the Railway Executive Committee.\n\nSamuel Fay was born in Hamble-le-Rice, on 30 December 1856. He was the second son of Joshua Fay (b. 1824 in Awbridge), a farmer of Hugenot origin, and Ann Philpott (b. 1820 in Eling). Fay was educated at Blenheim House school in Fareham.\n\nAt the age of 15½ Fay joined the London and South Western Railway. His first post was as a junior clerk at , from where he moved to Stockbridge on the Sprat and Winkle Line. After a 12-month period spent on the relief staff at various stations, Fay joined Kingston upon Thames where, in 1881, he launched the \"South Western Gazette\" together with two clerks in the general manager's office. The profits of the publication went to the L&SWR Orphanage Fund. Two years later, Fay wrote his first book, \"A Royal Road\", which was a brief history of the L&SWR.\n\nIn 1884, Fay was transferred to Waterloo as second clerk in the Traffic Superintendent's office. After a few months he was promoted to chief clerk. He was subsequently considered for manager of the Waterford and Central Ireland Railway, but withdrew his candidature on account of the poor prospects of the job. He became Assistant Storekeeper at Nine Elms in 1891. In the same year, he was elected to Kingston Council, but this proved to be a short-lived experience.\n\nIn early 1892, Fay was seconded to the Midland and South Western Junction Railway as Secretary and General Manager; at the time, the railway was in a poor condition, almost bankrupt and in the hands of a receiver. Within a period of twelve months, he had turned the situation around and restored the company to solvency, taking the place of the receiver. He also succeeded in promoting a bill for the Marlborough and Grafton Railway which completed the missing link between the two parts of the MSWJR, thereby avoiding the need to use the Great Western Railway's Berks & Hants Extension and Marlborough Railway from Savernake to Marlborough.\n\nIn 1899, Fay returned to Waterloo as the L&SWR's Superintendent of the Line. It was from here that he was appointed by Lord Faringdon, Chairman of the Great Central Railway, to succeed Sir William Pollitt as General Manager of the line in 1902. The Great Central was at that time in a precarious financial position due to the costs of constructing its London Extension, yet Fay was confident in his ability to repeat his performance with the M&SWJ. He was to be paid £3,000 per year and his contract was subject to six months notice on either side. Presumably as a result of his experience with the M&SWJR, Fay appears to have been head-hunted to become General Manager of the Great Central Railway. Whilst he was successful in maintaining the Great Central as an effective railway, Fay was not able completely to turn round the financial position of the company.\n\nOne of his first decisions was to extend the operation of through passenger services between Newcastle and , supplemented by express excursions between Nottingham, Leicester and Bournemouth. Fay also reintroduced services between Sheffield and Leeds via the Swinton and Knottingley Joint Railway, as well as through services from Marylebone to Stratford-upon-Avon. Journey times for expresses between Marylebone and Sheffield were cut to 3 hours, a reduction of 8 minutes at an average speed of 54.9 mph. Fay introduced several notable innovations to the Great Central including the setting-up of a Publicity Department in 1902, and the rolling-out of the first weekly zone season tickets in Manchester in 1904. He was also responsible for the setting-up of the \"Great Central Railway Journal\" in 1905 and the initiation of competitive examinations in 1907 to create promotion opportunities for promising young members of staff.\n\nFollowing his service with the War Office, Fay returned to the Great Central in May 1919. The Great Central's Board of Directors held their final meeting before the railway grouping on 15 December 1922. It was agreed to award Fay a pension of £3,000 per year.\n\nIn 1913, Fay became part-owner of the struggling Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway. He ran the line until the railway grouping and made a profit upon its disposal to the Southern Railway.\n\nIn 1924, Fay together with Sir Vincent Raven was appointed by the Government of New South Wales to the Royal Commission on the New South Wales Government Railways. The Commissioners reported in October 1924 that the metropolitan railway network was at saturation point and recommended the construction of a circular railway around Sydney, as well as the transfer of control over railway finances from the government to the Railway Commissioners. The construction of the City Circle line was subsequently commenced and a bill was passed amending the constitution of the Railway Commission.\n\nFay held two Argentine railway directorships - the Buenos Aires Great Southern and Buenos Aires Western Railway Companies. In 1923, he replaced Stanley Jackson on the board of directors of Beyer, Peacock and Company, constructor of numerous Great Central locomotives, of which he became Chairman on the retirement of Sir Vincent Caillard. For some time he also acted in an advisory capacity to the London and North Eastern Railway which had taken over the Great Central upon the railway grouping. Had Fay not been of retirement age at the time of the grouping, he would have been a strong contender for becoming general manager of the new company. In the event, Sir Ralph Wedgwood was appointed to the position.\n\nFay served on two committees unconnected with railways - the Committee on Post Office wages in 1904 and the Departmental Committee on Inshore Fisheries in 1912.\n\nFay had, in 1911, been invited by the Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane to join the Ports and Transit Executive Committee bringing together the railway managers of six principal railway companies to examine the problem of feeding London in the event of enemy action on the south coast. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, Fay together with the eight other managers of leading railways became part of the Railway Executive Committee chaired by the LSWR's Herbert Walker.\n\nAt the beginning of 1917, Fay took over the post of Director of Movements at the War Office, an experience which he was to write about in his book \"The War Office at War\" published in 1937; he refused to wear a military uniform or to remove his beard, even though his post carried the rank of general. In March 1918, he succeeded Sir Guy Granet, the Midland's General Manager, as Director-General of Movements and Railways, with a seat on the Army Council. During the period of his absence from the Great Central, Fay's assistant, E.A. Clear, took charge of the day-to-day running of the system.\n\nIn December 1918, he had proposed to the coalition government the creation of a \"Transport Authority\" which would be composed of the representatives of railway and dock companies, the Board of Trade, trade unions and agricultural and industrial bodies. The Authority would acquire, using public stock, the capital of the country's railways and canals, and divide their operations into five regional groups which the Authority could take over and control in the public interest. The Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, had previously dealt with Fay in 1906, when he adopted the latter's plans for a conciliation system to settle industrial disputes on the railways. Although the power of nationalisation was withdrawn in the face of opposition in Parliament, an Act came into force on 15 August 1919 which created the Ministry of Transport headed by Sir Eric Geddes.\n\nIn 1883, Fay married Frances Ann Farbrother (b. 1856 or 1857 in Kingston), with whom he had four daughters and four sons, including Edgar Fay, the judge. A heavy cigar-smoker, he lived in Cirencester, Gerrards Cross and finally Awbridge Danes near Romsey in Hampshire.\n\nIn June 1902 he was gazetted a Lieutenant-Colonel in The Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps, and re-gazetted at the same rank when E&RVSC became the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps of the Royal Engineers in April 1908. He received the Territorial Decoration in October 1920, and resigned his commission in January 1924.\n\nFay was knighted by King George V in somewhat theatrical fashion during the royal opening of the Immingham Dock on 22 July 1912. In 1944, he published a small volume of poems and essays.\n\nFay died in Awbridge on 30 May 1953, seven years after his wife, who had died on 10 July 1946. He is buried in the churchyard of All Saints Church. He had intended to write his memoirs but never got beyond the stage of rough notes.\n\nFay had a Great Central locomotive named in honour of his 1912 knighthood, the locomotives in the class becoming known informally as \"Sam Fays\".\n\nA bar/restaurant named \"Sam Fay's\" complete with railway memorabilia operated from the former Nottingham High Level station ticket office during the mid/late 1990s, although the station had always been on the Great Northern railway network until the LNER grouping in 1923.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2078398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078398", "title": "Battle of Tigranocerta", "text": "Battle of Tigranocerta\n\nThe Battle of Tigranocerta (, \"Tigranakerti tchakatamart\") was fought on 6 October 69 BC between the forces of the Roman Republic and the army of the Kingdom of Armenia led by King Tigranes the Great. The Roman force, led by Consul Lucius Licinius Lucullus, defeated Tigranes, and as a result, captured Tigranes' capital city of Tigranocerta.\n\nThe battle arose from the Third Mithridatic War being fought between the Roman Republic and Mithridates VI of Pontus, whose daughter Cleopatra was married to Tigranes. Mithridates fled to seek shelter with his son-in-law, and Rome invaded the Kingdom of Armenia. Having laid siege to Tigranocerta, the Roman forces fell back behind a nearby river when the large Armenian army approached. Feigning retreat, the Romans crossed at a ford and fell on the right flank of the Armenian army. After the Romans defeated the Armenian cataphracts, the balance of Tigranes' army, which was mostly made up of raw levies and peasant troops from his extensive empire, panicked and fled, and the Romans remained in charge of the field.\n\nTigranes' expansion into the Near East led to the creation of an Armenian empire that stretched almost across the entire region. With his father-in-law and ally securing the empire's western flank, Tigranes was able to conquer territories in Parthia and Mesopotamia and annex the lands of the Levant. In Syria, he began the construction of the city of Tigranocerta (also written Tigranakert), which he named after himself, and imported a multitude of peoples, including Arabs, Greeks, and Jews, to populate it. The city soon became the king's headquarters in Syria and flourished as a great centre for Hellenistic culture, complete with theatres, parks and hunting grounds.\n\nThis period of Armenian hegemony in the region, however, was coming close to an end with a series of Roman victories in the Roman–Mithridatic Wars. Friction between the two had existed for several decades, although it was during the Third Mithridatic War that the Roman armies under Lucullus made significant progress against Mithridates, forcing him to take refuge with Tigranes. Lucullus sent an ambassador named Appius Claudius to Antioch to demand that Tigranes surrender his father-in-law; should he refuse, Armenia would face war with Rome. Tigranes refused Appius Claudius' demands, stating that he would prepare for war against the Republic.\n\nLucullus was astonished upon hearing this in the year 70, and he began to prepare for an immediate invasion of Armenia. Although he had no mandate from the Senate to authorize such a move, he attempted to justify his invasion by distinguishing as his enemy king Tigranes and not his subjects. In the summer of 69, he marched his troops across Cappodocia and the Euphrates river and entered the Armenian province of Tsop'k', where Tigranocerta was located.\n\nTigranes, who was residing at Tigranocerta in the summer of 69, was not only astonished by the speed of Lucullus' rapid advance into Armenia but by the fact that he had even launched such an operation in the first place. Unable to reconcile with this reality for a certain period of time, he belatedly sent a general named Mithrobarzanes with 2,000-3,000 cavalrymen to slow down Lucullus' advance, but his forces were cut to pieces and routed by the 1,600 cavalry led by Sextilius, one of the legates serving under Lucullus. Learning of Mithrobarzanes' defeat, Tigranes entrusted the defence of his namesake city to Mancaeus and left to recruit a fighting force in the Taurus Mountains. Lucullus' legates were able to disrupt two separate detachments coming to the aid of Tigranes, and even located and engaged the king's forces in a canyon in the Taurus. Lucullus chose not to pursue Tigranes while he had an unimpeded path towards Tigranocerta; he advanced and began to lay siege to it.\n\nTigranocerta was still an unfinished city when Lucullus laid siege to it in the late summer of 69. The city was heavily fortified and according to the Greek historian Appian, had thick and towering walls that stood 25 meters high, providing a formidable defence against a prolonged siege. The Roman siege engines that were employed at Tigranocerta were effectively repelled by the defenders by the use of naphtha, making Tigranocerta, according to one scholar, the site of \"perhaps the world's first use of chemical warfare.\"\n\nHowever, since Tigranes had forcibly removed many of its inhabitants from their native lands and brought them to Tigranocerta, their allegiance to the king was cast into doubt. They soon proved their unreliability: when Tigranes and his army appeared on a hill overlooking the city, the inhabitants \"greeted his [Lucullus] appearance with shouts and din, and standing on the walls, threateningly pointed out the Armenians to the Romans.\"\n\nAppian claims that Lucullus had embarked from Rome with only a single legion; upon entering Anatolia to make war against Mithridates, he added four more legions to his army. The overall size of this force consisted of 30,000 infantry and 1,600 cavalry. Following Mithridates' retreat to Armenia, Appian estimates Lucullus' invading force to be only two legions and 500 horsemen, although it is highly improbable that he would have undertaken the invasion of Armenia with such a small army. Plutarch gave 16,000 heavy infantry and 1,000 cavalry, slingers and archers for the Romans at Tigranocerta. Of these, 6,000 heavy infantry did not participate in the battle. Eutropius put the Roman army at 18,000 men. Historian Adrian Sherwin-White places the size of Lucullus' force to 12,000 seasoned legionaries (composed of three legions), and 4,000 provincial cavalry and light infantry. The Roman army was further bolstered by several thousand allied Gallic, Thracian, and Bithynian infantry and cavalry, giving it a possible strength of 40,000.\n\nTigranes' army clearly held a numerical superiority over that of Lucullus'. According to Appian, it numbered 250,000 infantry and 50,000 cavalry. According to Plutarch, Lucullus stated in a letter to the senate to have fought 20,000 slingers and archers, 55,000 cavalry, including 17,000 armoured with mail, 150,000 heavy infantry and 35,000 non-combatants for a total of 225,000 soldiers and 35,000 non-combatants. Eutropius went further, claiming 600,000 Armenian cataphracts and 100,000 infantry. Memnon of Heraclea gave a more modest 80,000 infantry and cavalry. Phlegon of Tralles says Tigranes had 70,000 men, including 30,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry. Many scholars, however, doubt these figures accurately reflect the true number of Tigranes' army and believe they are highly inflated. Some historians, most notably Plutarch, wrote that Tigranes considered Lucullus' army far too small, and upon seeing it, is quoted to have said that \"If they come as ambassadors, they are too many; if they are soldiers, too few,\" although some have expressed doubt on the veracity of this quote. In 1985, Ruben Manaseryan estimated Tigranes' army at 80,000–100,000 men. Tigranes also possessed several thousand cataphracts, formidable heavily armoured cavalry that were clad in mail armour and armed with lances, spears or bows.\n\nThe two armies converged toward the Batman-Su river slightly to the south-west of Tigranocerta.\n\nTigranes' army was positioned on the east bank of the river while Lucullus, who had left a rear guard of 6,000 heavy infantry under Murena to continue the siege of the city, met the Armenian army on the river's west bank. The Armenian army was formed of three sections. Two of Tigranes' vassal kings led the left and right flanks, while Tigranes led his cataphracts in the centre. The rest of his army stood in front of a hill, a position Lucullus soon exploited.\n\nRoman troops at first attempted to dissuade Lucullus from engaging in battle since October 6 marked the day of the disastrous battle of Arausio, where the general Quintus Servilius Caepio and his Roman army were delivered a crushing defeat by the Germanic Cimbri and Teuton tribes. Ignoring his troops' superstitious beliefs, Lucullus is said to have responded, \"Verily, I will make this day, too, a lucky one for the Romans.\"\n\nCowan and Hook suggest that Lucullus would have deployed the Romans in a \"simplex acies\", that is to say a single line, so making the frontage of the army as wide as possible as a counter to the cavalry. He took several of his troops downriver, where the river was the easiest to ford, and at one point, Tigranes believed that this move meant Lucullus was withdrawing from the battlefield.\n\nLucullus had initially decided to make a \"running charge\" with his infantry, a Roman military tactic that minimized the amount of time an enemy could utilize its archers and sling infantry prior to close combat engagement. However, he decided against this at the last moment when he realized that the Armenian cataphracts posed the greatest threat to his men, ordering instead a diversionary attack with his Gallic and Thracian cavalry against the cataphracts.\n\nWith the cataphracts' attention fixated elsewhere, Lucullus formed two cohorts into maniples and then ordered them to ford across the river. His objective was to outflank Tigranes' cataphracts by circling counterclockwise around the hill and attacking them from the rear.\n\nLucullus personally led the charge on foot and upon reaching the top of the hill, he yelled to his soldiers in an effort to buoy their morale: \"The day is ours, the day is ours, my fellow soldiers!\" With this, he gave special instructions to the cohorts to attack the horses' legs and thighs, since these were the only areas of the cataphracts which were not armoured. Lucullus charged downwards along with his cohorts and his orders soon proved decisive: the lumbering cataphracts were caught by surprise and, in their attempts to break free from their attackers, careened into the ranks of their own men as the lines began to collapse.\n\nThe infantry, which was also made up of many non-Armenians, began to break rank and confusion spread to the rest of the body of Tigranes' army. While the great king himself took to flight with his baggage train northwards, the entire line of his army gave way.\n\nWith no army left to defend Tigranocerta, and a foreign populace that gleefully opened the gates to the Romans, Lucullus' army began the wholesale looting and plunder of the city. The city was burned. The king's treasury, estimated to be worth 8,000 talents, was looted and each soldier in the army was awarded 800 drachma. The battle also resulted in severe territorial losses: most of the lands in Tigranes' empire to the south of the Taurus fell under the sway of Rome.\n\nDespite the heavy losses Tigranes suffered, the battle did not end the war. In retreating northwards, Tigranes and Mithridates were able to elude Lucullus' forces, though losing again against the Romans during the battle of Artashat. In 68, Lucullus' forces began to mutiny, longing to return home, and he withdrew them from Armenia the following year.\n\nThe battle is highlighted by many historians specifically because Lucullus overcame the numerical odds facing his army. The Italian philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli remarked upon the battle in his book, \"The Art of War\", where he critiqued Tigranes' heavy reliance on his cavalry over his infantry.\n\nThe casualties reported for Tigranes' army are immense, with estimates given from 10,000 to as many as 100,000 men. Phlegon counted 5,000 dead and 5,000 captured. Orosius gave 30,000 losses, while Plutarch upped them to 100,000 infantry slain and the entire cavalry force wiped out save for a handful.\n\nPlutarch says that on the Roman side, \"only a hundred were wounded, and only five killed,\" although such low figures are highly unrealistic. Cowan and Hook, while considering these losses ridiculous, think it is clear that the battle was won with disproportionate losses.\n\n\n"}

It was the second major battle of the Gallic Wars.\n\nAfter following the migration of the Helvetii and defeating them, Caesar, around 20 June, moved towards Bibracte (approximately 18 miles away from their camp) to obtain the supplies promised by his allies, the Aedui. Dumnorix, an Aedui chieftain opposed to the Romans, had been delaying supplies from reaching Caesar's army.\n\nInformed by deserters from the allied auxiliary cavalry of Lucius Æmilius (the commander of the cavalry), the Helvetii decided to harass Caesar's rear guard. When Caesar observed this, he sent his cavalry to delay the attack. He then placed the Seventh (Legio VII Claudia), Eighth (Legio VIII Augusta), Ninth (Legio IX Hispana), and Tenth legions (Legio X Equestris), organized in Roman fashion (triplex acies, or \"triple battle order\"), at the foot of a nearby hill, the top of which he occupied himself, along with the Eleventh (Legio XI Claudia) and Twelfth (Legio XII Fulminata) Legions and all his auxiliaries. His baggage train was assembled near the summit, where it could be guarded by the forces there.\n\nHaving driven off Caesar's cavalry and with their own baggage train secured, the Helvetii engaged \"In the seventh hour\", approximately noon or one o'clock. According to Caesar, his hilltop battle line easily threw back the onslaught by using pila (javelins/throwing spears). The Roman legionaries then drew swords and advanced downhill wading into their opponents. Many Helvetii warriors had pila sticking out of their shields and threw them aside to fight unencumbered, but this also made them more vulnerable. The legions drove the Helvetii back toward the hill where their baggage train sat.\n\nWhile the legions pursued the Helvetii across the plain between the hills, the Boii and the Tulingi arrived with fifteen thousand men to assist the Helvetii, flanking the Romans on one side. At that point, the Helvetii returned to the battle in earnest. When the Tulingi and the Boii started circumventing the Romans, Caesar regrouped his third line to resist the assault of the Boii and Tuligni, keeping his primary and secondary committed to chasing the Helvetii.\n\nThe battle lasted many hours into the night, until the Romans finally took the Helvetic baggage train, capturing both a daughter and a son of Orgetorix. According to Caesar, 130,000 enemies escaped, of which 110,000 survived the retreat. Unable to pursue on account of battle wounds and the time it took to bury the dead, Caesar rested three days before he followed the fleeing Helvetii. These, in turn, had managed to reach the territory of the Lingones within four days of the battle. Caesar warned the Lingones not to assist them, prompting the Helvetii and their allies to surrender.\n\nCaesar claimed that of the 368,000 Helvetii and allies, only 130,000 got away, of whom 110,000 returned home. Orosius, probably drawing on the works of Caesar's general Asinius Pollio, gave an original strength of 157,000 for the barbarians, adding that 47,000 died during the campaign. Strabo states an even lower figure, with only 8,000 escaping the battle, an estimate assessed as plausible by Hans Delbrück.\n\nAlso according to Caesar the census totals of the tribes at the start of the war were:\n"}

He was a student of Posidonius of Rhodes, and the teacher of Octavian (the future Caesar Augustus) at Apollonia. He was a personal friend of Strabo, from whom we derive some knowledge of his life.\n\nIn 44 BC, he seems to have followed Octavian to Rome and continued mentoring him there. He is reputed there to have openly rebuked the Emperor, and to have instructed him to recite the alphabet before reacting in anger. Later, Athenodorus returned to Tarsus, where he was instrumental in expelling the government of Boëthus and drafting a new constitution for the city, the result of which was a pro-Roman oligarchy.\n\nAthenodorus is also written of by Pliny the Younger, who tells us of Athenodorus' renting of a haunted house in Athens. Athenodorus was wary because the house was exceptionally cheap for its size. When Athenodorus was writing a book of philosophy, late at night, a ghost is said to have come to him. The ghost, who was bound with chains, beckoned Athenodorus to follow him, leading him to a courtyard, where the ghost suddenly vanished. Athenodorus marked the spot, and the next day, with the permission of the city magistrates, he dug up the earth from that spot, where he found the skeleton of an old man, bound with chains. After the skeleton was given a proper burial, the ghost was said to have never haunted that house again.\n\nStrabo, Cicero, and Eusebius regarded him highly. Works attributed to Athenodorus include:\n\nNone of these are extant, but he also assisted Cicero in writing his \"De Officiis\" and it has been suggested that his work may have influenced Seneca and Saint Paul. Following his death, the people of Tarsus held an annual festival and sacrifice in his honour.\n"}

He graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1936. He taught English and began his writing career with short stories for magazines. Then, starting in 1941, he wrote or co-wrote 22 screenplays.\n\nWilson was credited on \"The Men in Her Life \" (1941) with Loretta Young.\n\nHe did some William Boyd westerns, \"Border Patrol\" (1943), \"Colt Comrades\" (1943), \"Bar 20\" (1943), and \"Forty Thieves\" (1944).\n\nWilson's career in Hollywood was interrupted by service with the United States Marine Corps during World War II.\n\nIn 1945 he became a contract writer with Liberty Films, working (uncredited) on such pictures as \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946).\n\nHe was a co-winner of the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for \"A Place in the Sun\" (1951), and won an Edgar Award and another Oscar nomination for his script for \"5 Fingers\" (1953).\n\nWilson was named an unfriendly witness by the House Un-American Activities Committee and blacklisted for being a communist. After he was blacklisted, he left for France and worked on scripts for the European film industry.\n\nWhile blacklisted, Wilson wrote the script for \"Salt of the Earth\" (1954), a fictionalized account of a real strike by zinc miners in Grant County, New Mexico. The movie was directed by Herbert Biberman and produced by Paul Jarrico both of whom had also been blacklisted. The film has been deemed \"culturally significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nHe wrote or collaborated on scripts for Hollywood films without credit or under a pseudonym for much less than his usual fee before being blacklisted, including \"Carnival Story\" (1954) (for King Brothers Productions who often used blacklisted writers); \"They Were So Young\" (1954); \"The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell\" (1955), for Otto Preminger; \"Friendly Persuasion\" (1956), for William Wyler; \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957), for Sam Spiegel and David Lean; \"The Two-Headed Spy\" (1958); \"Tempest\" (1958) and \"5 Branded Women\" (1960) for Dino De Laurentiis; and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) for Spiegel and Lean again.\n\nHis screenplay for \"Friendly Persuasion\" was nominated for an Academy Award, but was disqualified because his name did not appear in the credits. Director William Wyler wanted his brother, Robert Wyler, and Jessamyn West credited for rewriting the script, but Wilson disputed this. Wyler then was able under the rules of the blacklist to have one of the few films in history credited to no writer at all.\n\nWilson and Carl Foreman worked separately on \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", but as both were blacklisted, the official credit went to Pierre Boulle, upon whose novel the movie was based, even though Boulle did not even speak English.\n\nWilson remained in France with his family for nine years, before returning to the United States in 1964.\n\nWilson continued to write screenplays, including for \"The Sandpiper\" (1965), \"Planet of the Apes\" (1968), and \"Che!\" (1969). His screenplay for \"Planet of the Apes\" was based on a novel by Pierre Boulle; only Boulle received screen credit.\n\nMichael Wilson was awarded Writers Guild of America's Laurel Award in 1975 and was posthumously awarded his second Academy Award in 1984 for \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\".\n\nIn 1995, Wilson was credited by the academy's board of directors with an Academy Award nomination as a co-writer of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and credited as the winner of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain Award for Best British Dramatic Screenplay.\n\nWilson also completed an unproduced screenplay on December 16, 1976, \"The Raid On Harper's Ferry\", which was an adaptation of Truman J. Nelson's book \"The Old Man: John Brown at Harper's Ferry\" (1973). He also apparently wrote unproduced scripts for a movie about the Industrial Workers of the World titled \"The Wobblies\" and a movie about the infiltration of the Black Liberation Movement titled \"Quiet Darkness\".\n\nMichael Wilson married Zelma Gussin in 1941; the couple had two daughters.

In response to a perceived heavy influx of immigrants, the Conservative Party government tightened the regulations, permitting only those with government-issued employment vouchers, limited in number, to settle. The leader of the opposition in Parliament at the time, Hugh Gaitskell of the Labour Party, called the act \"cruel and brutal anti-colour legislation\".\n\nThe Act specified that all Commonwealth citizens, including citizens of the UK and Colonies (CUKCs), without a relevant connection to the UK were subject to immigration control.

It includes two performance halls (1500 seats), gallery and lecture spaces, a library, a bookstore, and administrative spaces for the Anthroposophical Society; neighboring buildings house the society's research and educational facilities. Conferences focusing on themes of general interest or directed toward teachers, farmers, doctors, therapists, and other professionals are held at the center throughout the year.\n\nBoth the present Goetheanum building and its precursor have been widely cited as masterpieces of modern architecture.\n\nThe Goetheanum is open for visitors seven days a week and offers tours several times daily.\n\nThe First Goetheanum, a timber and concrete structure designed by Rudolf Steiner, was one of seventeen buildings Steiner designed between 1908 and 1925. It was intended as a \"Gesamtkunstwerk\" (the synthesis of diverse artistic media and sensory effects), infused with spiritual significance. Begun in 1913 to house the annual summer theater events of the Anthroposophical Society, it rapidly became the center of a small colony of spiritual seekers located in Dornach and based around Steiner. Numerous visual artists contributed to the building: architects created the unusual double-dome wooden structure over a curving concrete base, stained glass windows added color into the space, painters decorated the ceiling with motifs depicting the whole of human evolution, and sculptors carved huge column bases, capitals, and architraves with images of metamorphoses.\n\nAlready during the construction, musicians, actors, and movement artists began performing a wide variety of pieces in a neighboring workshop. When the Goetheanum hall was completed, in 1919, these performances moved onto the stage located under the Goetheanum's smaller cupola. The auditorium was located under the larger cupola. The building was opened on September 26, 1920.\n\nThis building was destroyed by fire on New Year's Eve, December 31, 1922 – January 1, 1923, and some claim by arson, but that is not proven.\n\nIn the course of 1923, Steiner designed a building to replace the original. This building, now known as the Second Goetheanum, was built wholly of cast concrete. Begun in 1924, the building was not completed until 1928, after the architect's death. It represents a pioneering use of visible concrete in architecture and has been granted protected status as a Swiss national monument. Art critic Michael Brennan has called the building a \"true masterpiece of 20th-century expressionist architecture\".\n\nThe present Goetheanum houses a 1000-seat auditorium, now the center of an active artistic community incorporating performances of its in-house theater and eurythmy troupes as well as visiting performers from around the world. Full remodelings of the central auditorium took place in the mid-1950s and again in the late 1990s. The stained glass windows in the present building date from Steiner's time; the painted ceiling and sculptural columns are contemporary replications or reinterpretations of those in the First Goetheanum.\n\nIn a dedicated gallery, the building also houses a nine-meter-high wooden sculpture, \"The Representative of Humanity\", by Edith Maryon and Rudolf Steiner.\n\nSteiner's architecture is characterized by a liberation from traditional architectural constraints, especially through the departure from the right-angle as a basis for the building plan. For the first Goetheanum he achieved this in wood by employing boat builders to construct its rounded forms; for the second Goetheanum by using concrete to achieve sculptural shapes on an architectural scale. The use of concrete to achieve organically expressive forms was an innovation for the times; in both buildings, Steiner sought to create forms that were spiritually expressive.\n\nSteiner suggested that he had derived the sculptural forms of the first Goetheanum from spiritual inspirations.\n\nSteiner designed approximately 12-13 other built structures, including both institutional structures and residences in and around Dornach. Steiner is one of very few major architects who was never the pupil of another major architect.\n\nArchitects who have visited and praised the Goetheanum's architecture include Henry van de Velde, Frank Lloyd Wright, Hans Scharoun, and Frank Gehry.\n\n"}

In the early 1930s, Mapy traveled to New York City, where she married childhood friend Fernando \"Papi\" Cortés. Under contract to a theatrical troupe headlined by Dominican baritone Eduardo Brito, the couple traveled to Spain. After the company disbanded, the couple began performing in different \"teatro de revista\" companies, primarily in Barcelona. In 1933, Mapy Cortés made her film debut as one of the two female leads in the comedy \"Dos Mujeres y un Don Juan\" (\"Two Women and a don Juan\"). By that time Cortés had a nephew, Paquito Cordero, who would become a famed actor and producer in Puerto Rico.\nAfter the start of the Spanish Civil War, Mapy and Fernando Cortés went to Marseilles before making their way down to Argentina. Following stops in Buenos Aires and Havana, where they appeared on stage and movies, the couple traveled to Mexico City. They made their stage debut as part of the Cantinflas revue and soon joined the growing Mexican film industry, which lacked established female stars. Back-to-back starring roles in three hit films - the Pan-American musical \"La liga de las canciones / The League of Songs\" (Chano Urueta, 1941), the nostalgia musical comedy \"¡Ay, qué tiempos, señor don Simón! / Oh, What Times, Don Simon!\" (Julio Bracho, 1941) and the Cantinflas comedy \"El gendarme desconocido / The Unknown Policeman\" (Miguel M. Delgado, 1941) - quickly turned Mapy Cortés into one of the most bankable leading ladies in Mexican cinema. In 1942, Cortés made her only foray into Hollywood cinema, playing a singer in the 1942 RKO wartime musical comedy \"Seven Days' Leave.\" Her eponymous character is engaged to Victor Mature's soldier character before he falls in love with a socialite played by Lucille Ball.\n\nAfter filming ended, Mapy Cortés returned to fulfill multiple engagements in Mexico, playing top-billed roles in musical comedies. In 1945, the Mapy Cortés vehicle \"La pícara Susana / Mischievous Susana\" (1945) marked the directorial debut of her husband Fernando, who remained very active as a comedy director in Mexican film and TV, directing vehicles for popular Mexican comedians like Tin-Tan, Resortes, and la India Maria.\n\nWhile Fernando remained in demand as director until his death, Mapy's film career waned in the 1950s. The couple received an invitation from Ángel Ramos, owner of El Mundo Enterprises, to work on the first television transmission of WKAQ-TV Telemundo Channel 2. On March 28, 1954, Puerto Rico received its first television transmission from Telemundo: a live broadcast of the Spanish comedy \"El caso de la mujer asesinadita\", starring Mapy and directed by Fernando. The couple also starred in the station's first comedy show \"Mapy y Papi,\" an adaptation of the \"I Love Lucy\" format that also featured Maria Judith Franco and Mapy's nephew Paquito Cordero. After the show came off the air in Puerto Rico, the couple returned to Mexico City, where they starred in a Mexican version of \"Mapy y Papi\".\n\nHer niece Mapita Cortés, Miss Puerto Rico 1957, lived with them in Mexico City and briefly joined the Mexican film industry in the late 1950s. After an eight-year absence, Mapy Cortés made a brief return to Mexican cinema with a supporting role in the comedy \"Dormitorio para señoritas / Girls' Dormitory \"(1959), a loose remake of her 1943 hit \"Internado para señoritas / Girls' Dormitory\" (1943), starring Mapita and directed by husband Fernando. However, Mapita retired after her marriage to popular Chilean crooner Lucho Gatica. By the 1960s, Mapy was working mostly on the Mexico City stage, including roles in comedies by Spanish author Alfonso Paso. Her last film appearances were playing supporting roles in three Puerto Rican/Mexican co-productions, filmed in Puerto Rico, directed by her husband, and produced by her nephew Paquito.\n\nAfter Fernando Cortés died, Mapy Cortés returned to Puerto Rico and led a relatively quiet life. She died at her home in 1998, of a heart attack. She was buried at the Puerto Rico Memorial Cemetery in Carolina, Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The line ran from a temporary station in Manchester to another in Stockport at the north end of the uncompleted Stockport Viaduct. The temporary station which was later renamed Heaton Norris was Stockport's only station for more than two years. After the viaduct was completed, the M&BR built a station at its southern end as an experiment. The decision was prompted by complaints that the first station was a long way from the industrial parts of town and even farther from the residential districts on the south side. The second station opened on 15 February 1843 as Edgeley. By 1844, it was the town's principal station. Heaton Norris, at the north end of the viaduct, closed in 1959.\n\nThe station was operated by the London and North Western Railway and became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923.

The project came to a halt when the \"big bang\" extension was stopped.\n\nThe proposed extension would have reused some of the former railway alignment but some of it was built on or filled in after closure.

He is best known for playing \"The Demon Headmaster\" in the children's television series of the same name, and also for portraying Luftwaffe Police Major Reinhardt in the 1970s drama series \"Secret Army\".\n\nBorn in Forest Gate, Newham, London, Hardiman was educated at Buckhurst Hill County High School, Essex, and at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge (then known as Fitzwilliam House), where he read English. He is often seen playing authority figures, and has played Nazi era German military personnel (\"Secret Army\", \"Colditz\", \"Wish Me Luck\" and \"Enemy at the Door\") and British officers (\"When the Boat Comes In\"), police inspectors (\"Juliet Bravo\" and \"Softly, Softly\"), doctors (\"Home to Roost\", \"The Royal\"), barristers (\"Crown Court\" and \"The Brittas Empire\"), judges (\"The Bill\" and \"The Courtroom\"), Father Abbot Radulfus (\"Cadfael\"), and an evil headmaster (\"The Demon Headmaster\"). He also played Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, in Richard Attenborough's \"Gandhi\".\n\nHardiman's television work has included him playing barrister Stephen Harvesty in Granada Television's \"Crown Court\" from 1972 to 1983. Hardiman's portrayal of Major Reinhardt, in \"Secret Army\", the (fictional) head of the Luftwaffe (German Air force) police, often provided a foil to Clifford Rose's more brutal S.S. Chief, Kessler.\n\nAs with many of the characters in \"Secret Army\", Reinhardt was not a one dimensional villain, but a rounded character who often questioned his own motives and methods. The actor's portrayal allowed the viewer to sympathise with this character. In 1990, he played a two dimensional German officer, General Stuckler, in the final series of London Weekend Television's \"Wish Me Luck\".\n\nHardiman starred as the eponymous \"The Demon Headmaster\" in the children's television drama series, which ran to three series from 1996 to 1998, and proved popular with adults as well as children. He reprised his role as a cameo in the 2019 reboot .\n\nHe also had a starring role as Charles Pooter in the 1979 television adaptation of George and Weedon Grossmith's \"Diary of a Nobody\", a role which shows his versatility more than the succession of officers he usually portrays. Hardiman's other recurring role was as Brother Cadfael's ecclesiastical superior, Abbot Radulfus, in the television series. Joining him throughout the series as Prior Robert was Michael Culver, who had played his predecessor Major Brandt in \"Secret Army\".\n\nA notable small role Hardiman played was a version of the Sergeant Wilson character from \"Dad's Army\", in an episode of time travel comedy \"Goodnight Sweetheart\", called \"Don't Get Around Much Any More\", in which Nicholas Lyndhurst's character Gary Sparrow goes back in time to a bank in the 1940s, and encounters characters called Mainwaring and Wilson. Hardiman's portrayal was a keenly observed impersonation of John Le Mesurier's own performance, incorporating many of the tics and mannerisms of the original.\n\nHardiman also appeared as Grand Wizard Egbert Hellibore in four episodes of \"The Worst Witch\". Hardiman appeared in the second series of \"The Worst Week of My Life\". Another notable recent role was as a devious Swiss murder victim in an episode of crime mystery series \"Jonathan Creek\".\n\nHe made an appearance on the daily soap on BBC One, \"Doctors\", on 3 April 2009, as well as from 14 to 15 January 2015, and in the drama from Yorkshire, \"Heartbeat\", as John Upton in one episode. In 2009, he appeared in a film for the BFI, \"Radio Mania: An Abandoned Work\", directed by British artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard. The film was based on \"The Man from M.A.R.S.\" (1922). Hardiman appeared as Hawthorne in the episode of \"Doctor Who\", \"The Beast Below\", on 10 April 2010.\n\n\n"}

His father was a Russian Jewish immigrant, a lawyer, poet and socialist. While attending UCLA, Jarrico joined the Young Communist League, where he became an active member of the American Communist Party. His alliance and association with the party lasted from 1937 to 1952. Jarrico married Sylvia Gussin in 1936. Sylvia's younger sister, Zelma, married screenwriter Michael Wilson in 1941.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Jarrico began his writing career. He mostly wrote crime and comedy scripts for lower budget Hollywood films with Columbia Pictures. Among these films were \"No Time to Marry\" (1937), \"I Am the Law\" (1938), and \"Beauty for the Asking\" (1939), starring Lucille Ball. In the early 1940s, Jarrico was sent to Northern Africa and Italy to be a merchant marine in World War II. When he returned home he restarted his career with Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures. His 1941 film \"Tom, Dick and Harry\", starring Ginger Rogers, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nIn 1943, Jarrico co-scripted the feature film \"Song of Russia\". The film was created under pressure from president Franklin D. Roosevelt to garner sympathy from the public for the Soviet cause in their war against Germany. Some other successful films written by Jarrico in the 1940s include \"Thousands Cheer\" (1943), \"The Search\" (1948) and \"Not Wanted\" (1949).\n\nJarrico had engaged in a protracted legal battle with Howard Hughes, the head of RKO. In 1950, while working on his newest script for the Howard Hughes film, \"The White Tower\", a friend close to Jarrico gave his name to the House Un-American Activities Committee. Immediately upon hearing the news of Jarrico's subpoena, Hughes dismissed Jarrico from the film. After refusing to testify before HUAC, Jarrico was blacklisted and his passport was confiscated. This made it extremely difficult for him to make films. No American studios were willing to make his scripts into movies, and he could not go to other countries due to his lack of a passport. \n\nIn 1954, Jarrico went to New Mexico with Herbert J. Biberman, a fellow blacklist filmmaker, where they created the film \"Salt of the Earth\". The film was the only one to be made by blacklisted filmmakers, and therefore became blacklisted itself, making it the only blacklisted film. The film was one of 100 films chosen by the Library of Congress for the National Film Registry in 1992.\n\nIn 1958, he moved to Europe where he lived for over twenty years. During the 1960s he used the pseudonym Peter Achilles to co-script several films, including \"Jovanka e l’Altri\" (1960), \"Call Me Bwana\" (1963), \"Der Schatz der Azteken\" (1965) and \"La Balada de Johnny Ringo\" (1966). He also wrote scripts for television in Europe all throughout the 1960s. \n\nIn 1966 Jarrico divorced Sylvia Gussin, his wife of 30 years, to marry a Frenchwoman, Yvette Le Floc'h, from whom he separated in 1977. He then returned to the United States where he met and, in 1992, married Lia Benedetti. He spent the rest of his life in California. He taught courses at the University of California at Santa Barbara and lectured on film theory and the blacklist in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nJarrico died on October 28, 1997, in a car accident. He was returning home after attending events commemorating the beginnings of the blacklist fifty years earlier. He was 82 years old. \n\n\n\n"}

This wide tie is usually patterned, folded over, and fastened with a tie pin or tie clip. It is usually reserved for formal wear with morning dress for daytime weddings and worn with a cutaway morning coat and striped grey formal trousers. This type of dress cravat is made of a thicker, woven type of silk similar to a modern tie and is traditionally either grey or black.\n\nThe ascot is descended from the earlier type of cravat widespread in the early 19th century, most notably during the age of Beau Brummell, made of heavily starched linen and elaborately tied around the neck. Later in the 1880s, amongst the upper-middle-class in Europe men began to wear a more loosely tied version for formal daytime events with daytime full dress in frock coats or with morning coats. It remains a feature of morning dress for weddings today. The Royal Ascot race meeting at the Ascot Racecourse gave the ascot its name, although such dress cravats were no longer worn with morning dress at the Royal Ascot races by the Edwardian era. The ascot was still commonly worn for business with morning dress in the late 19th and very early 20th centuries.\n\nIn British English, the casual form is called a cravat, or sometimes as a day cravat to distinguish it from the highly formal dress cravat. It is made from a thinner woven silk that is more comfortable when worn against the skin, often with ornate and colourful printed patterns.\n\nStudents at the United States Army Officer Candidate School wear ascots as part of their uniform, black for basic officer candidates, blue for intermediate candidates, and white for senior officer candidates. Pararescue trainees (upon completion of extended training day) are given a blue ascot. In the United States Navy the ascot is now worn for ceremonial purposes with Enlisted Full Dress Whites and Enlisted Full Dress Blue in the Ceremonial Guard. \nIn the Dutch Army, it is a part of the uniform, for barrack use, the ascot is often in the weapon colors, and with a logo, and when in combat uniform, a DPM or desert version is used. Likewise the Royal Danish Army employs an ascot for the ceremonial version of the barrack dress, its colors vary between each company.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2078541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078541", "title": "Midnight movie", "text": "Midnight movie\n\nThe term midnight movie is rooted in the practice that emerged in the 1950s of local television stations around the United States airing low-budget genre films as late-night programming, often with a host delivering ironic asides. As a cinematic phenomenon, the midnight screening of offbeat movies began in the early 1970s in a few urban centers, particularly in New York City with screenings of \"El Topo\" at the Elgin Theater, eventually spreading across the country. The screening of non-mainstream pictures at midnight was aimed at building a cult film audience, encouraging repeat viewing and social interaction in what was originally a countercultural setting.\n\nThe national success of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and the changing economics of the film exhibition industry altered the nature of the midnight movie phenomenon; as its association with broader trends of cultural and political opposition dwindled in the 1980s, the midnight movie became a more purely camp experience—in effect, bringing it closer to the television form that shares its name. The term \"midnight movie\" is now often used in two different, though related, ways: as a synonym for \"B movie\", reflecting the relative cheapness characteristic of late-night movies both theatrically and on TV, and as a synonym for \"cult film\".\n\nIn 1953, the Screen Actors Guild agreed to a residuals payment plan that greatly facilitated the distribution of B movies to television. A number of local television stations around the United States soon began showing inexpensive genre films in late-night slots; these late-night slots were after the safe-harbor time, meaning they were largely exempt from Federal Communications Commission regulations on indecent content. In the spring of 1954, Los Angeles TV station KABC expanded on the concept by having an appropriately offbeat host introduce the films: for a year on Saturday nights, \"The Vampira Show\", with Maila Nurmi in her newly adopted persona of a sexy bloodsucker (\"Your pin-down girl\"), presented low-budget movies with black humor and a low-cut black dress. The show—which ran at midnight for four weeks before shifting to 11 p.m. and, later, 10:30—aired horror pictures like \"Devil Bat's Daughter\" and \"Strangler of the Swamp\" and suspense films such as \"Murder by Invitation\", \"The Charge Is Murder\", and \"Apology for Murder\". The format was echoed by stations across the country, who began showing their late-night B movies with in-character hosts such as Zacherley and Morgus the Magnificent offering ironic interjections.\n\nA quarter-century later, Cassandra Peterson established a persona that was essentially a ditzier, more buxom version of Vampira. As Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, Peterson became the most popular host in the arena of the TV midnight movie. Starting at L.A.'s KHJ-TV in 1981, Elvira's \"Movie Macabre\" was soon being syndicated nationally; Peterson presented mostly cut-rate horror films, interrupted on a regular basis for tongue-in-cheek commentary. Some local stations aired the \"Movie Macabre\" package in late-night slots. Others showed it during prime time on weekend nights; after a break for the local news, another genre film—a literal midnight movie—might follow, resulting in such virtual double bills as \"Dr. Heckyl & Mr. Hype\" and \"The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave\". USA Network launched a midnight movie package in 1989—\"Up All Night\", which showed mainly horror and soft-core sexploitation films, ran until 1998. In 1993, Buffalo's WKBW-TV began airing a late-night hosted mix of low-budget genre movies, foreign art films and eventually well-known classic films; \"Off Beat Cinema\" later became nationally syndicated (currently through Retro Television Network) and, as of 2013, originates from WBBZ-TV. In the 2000s, horror-oriented late-night movie programming has disappeared from many broadcast stations, though B pictures, mostly of a melodramatic nature, are still widely used in post–prime time slots. The small America One broadcast network distributes the \"Macabre Theatre\" movie package hosted by Butch Patrick, known for his portrayal of Eddie Munster on the 1960s show \"The Munsters\". In 2006, Turner Classic Movies began airing cult films as part of its new late-night series, \"TCM Underground\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the BBC launched a regular late night movie slot on Saturday nights on BBC Two. From Saturday August 20 1966, BBC Two started to air a \"Midnight Movie\" every Saturday night on the channel. The first \"Midnight Movie\" was \"Blind Date\" starring Hardy Krüger. The Midnight Movie would air every Saturday night on BBC Two, and would continue through the 1970s. The Midnight Movie was an attempt by the BBC to provide a late night alternative, when the two other channels BBC One and ITV would normally end their Saturday programming at around 12-midnight. This was partly due to the restrictions imposed on the broadcasting hours of both BBC and ITV by the British government, normally no more than 8 hours in a given day. As BBC Two did not broadcast a large amount of daytime programming, they had plenty of hours to spare to remain on the air late into the night, especially on a Saturday, thus the creation of the \"Midnight Movie\" strand was started. Most of the films aired were at least a decade old, but from 1967 nearly all of the films broadcast were made in color, as BBC Two became the first UK channel in 1967 to transmit color television. It is also noted however, that the \"Midnight Movie\" never actually started at Midnight. The movie was designed to air \"through\" the midnight hour, and could start as early as 11.15pm. By 1983 the \"Midnight Movie\" strand was abandoned by BBC Two, with BBC One airing a late night movie on a Friday night instead, usually a horror film. The \"Midnight Movie\" slot on BBC Two would be replaced with late night sporting coverage or different genre of films on occasions, which would not use the \"Midnight Movie\" strand.\n\nSince at least as far back as the 1930s, exploitation films had sometimes been presented at midnight screenings, usually as part of independent roadshow operations. In 1957, Hammer Films' \"The Curse of Frankenstein\" set off a spate of midnight presentations. What film qualifies as the first true midnight movie in the sense of the term that emerged in the 1970s remains an open question. Critic Jennifer M. Wood points to the Palace Theater in San Francisco's North Beach district where, in 1968, San Francisco Art Institute graduates Steven Arnold and Michael Wiese, after a sellout screening of their Dalí-esque thesis film \"Messages, Messages\", were invited to program offbeat films at midnight. Author Gary Lachman claims that Kenneth Anger's short \"Invocation of My Demon Brother\" (1969), a mélange of occult symbology intercut with and superimposed on images from a Rolling Stones concert, \"inaugurat[ed] the midnight movie cult at the Elgin Theatre.\" The Elgin, in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood, would soon become famous as a midnight venue when it gave the U.S. premiere of a very unusual Mexican movie directed and written by a rather Dalí-esque Chilean.\nThe movie generally recognized as igniting the theatrical midnight film movement is Alejandro Jodorowsky's surrealist \"El Topo\", which opened in December 1970 at the Elgin. Playing with the conventions of the spaghetti Western, the film was described by one newspaper critic as \"full of tests and riddles\" and \"more phony gore than maybe 20 years of \"The Wild Bunch\".\" \"El Topo\" regularly sold out every night for months, with many fans returning on a weekly basis. It ran at the theater through June 1971, until at the prompting of John Lennon—who was reported to have seen the film at least three times—Beatles manager Allen Klein purchased the film through his ABKCO film company and gave it a relatively orthodox rerelease. The Elgin soon came up with another midnight hit in Peter Bogdanovich's spree-killer thriller \"Targets\" (1968), featuring one of the last performances by horror movie mainstay Boris Karloff and a tale that resonated with the assassinations and other political violence of recent years. By November 1971, four Manhattan theaters beside the Elgin were featuring regularly scheduled midnight movies: the St. Marks (\"Viva la muerte\", a blast of surrealism in the Franco-Spanish tradition of Luis Buñuel and another Lennon favorite), the Waverly (\"Equinox\", which had just replaced \"Night of the Living Dead\"), the Bijou (both \"Freaks\" and \"Night of the Living Dead\"), and the Olympia (\"Macunaíma\", a Brazilian political black comedy). \"Equinox\" (1970) and \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968), both low-budget horror pictures, demonstrate the ties between the old, TV brand of midnight movie and the newer phenomenon. George A. Romero's zombie masterpiece, in particular, highlights the differences: produced completely outside of the organized studio system, it has a subversive posture evident throughout and especially in its conclusion, an unmistakable allegory of a racist lynching.\n\nShot over the winter of 1971–72, John Waters's \"filth epic\" \"Pink Flamingos\", featuring incest and coprophagia, became the best known of a group of campy midnight films focusing on sexual perversions and fetishism. Filmed on weekends in Waters's hometown of Baltimore, with a mile-long extension cord as a power conduit, it was also crucial in inspiring the growth of the independent film movement. In 1973, the Elgin Theater started midnight screenings of both \"Pink Flamingos\" and a crime drama from Jamaica with a remarkable soundtrack. In its mainstream release, \"The Harder They Come\" (1972) had been a flop, panned by critics after its U.S. distributor, Roger Corman's New World Pictures, marketed it as a blaxploitation picture. Rereleased as a midnight film, it screened around the country for six years, helping spur the popularity of reggae in the United States. While the midnight-movie potential of certain films was recognized only some time after they opened, a number during this period were distributed to take advantage of the market from the beginning—in 1973, for instance, \"Broken Goddess\", \"Dragula\", \"The White Whore and the Bit Player\", and \"Elevator Girls in Bondage\" (as well as \"Pink Flamingos\") had their New York premieres at midnight screenings. In 1974, midnight opener \"Flesh Gordon\" evidenced how the phenomenon lent itself to flirtations with pornography.\n\nAround this time, the black comedy \"Harold and Maude\" (1971) became the first major Hollywood studio movie of the era to develop a substantial cult audience of repeat viewers; though apparently it was not picked up by much of the midnight movie circuit during the 1970s, it subsequently became a late show staple as the phenomenon turned more to camp revivals. The midnight screening phenomenon was spreading around the country. In Milwaukee, it began in May 1974, spurred by the sales manager of a local radio station who had already successfully sponsored such screenings in St. Louis. By the following February, four Milwaukee theaters were regularly showing midnight films, and the Marcus chain, the owner of one, had brought the concept to its theaters in four other Midwestern cities. \"Films that feature rock concerts draw big\", \"Boxoffice\" reported, \"as do those dealing with outer space and fantasy\". The trade paper noted one popular midnight film by name: \"Alice's Restaurant\" (1969), a comedy with political overtones starring folk singer Arlo Guthrie.\nOn the midnight following April Fool's Day 1976, \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\", which had flopped on initial release the year before, opened at the Waverly Theater, a leading midnight movie venue in New York's Greenwich Village. Midnight screenings of the film soon became a national sensation, amassing a cult following all over the United States. Every Friday and Saturday night, audience members would talk back to the screen, dress up as characters in the film, and act out scenes complete with props. Where the social aspect had always been a part of the midnight movie's attraction, with \"Rocky Horror\" in an exaggerated way it became \"the\" attraction. By summer 1979, the film was playing on weekend midnights in twenty-odd suburban theaters in the New York region alone; 20th Century Fox had approximately two hundred prints of the movie in circulation for midnight shows around the country. Beginning in 1978, the Waverly developed another midnight success that was much smaller commercially, but more significant artistically: \"Eraserhead\", originally distributed the previous year. David Lynch's feature debut, a model of shoestring surrealism, reaffirmed the midnight movie's most central traditions. Additionally, concert films, such as \"\" (1972), \"The Song Remains the Same\" (1976), \"The Grateful Dead Movie\" (1977) and \"The Last Waltz\" (1978), became popular midnight screening selections during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe commercial viability of the sort of big-city arthouses that launched outsider pictures for the midnight movie circuit began to decline in the late 1970s as broad social and economic shifts weakened their countercultural base. Leading midnight movie venues were beginning to fold as early as 1977—that year, New York's Bijou switched back permanently to the live entertainment for which it had been built, and the Elgin, after a brief run with gay porn, shut down completely. In succeeding years, the popularization of the VCR and the expansion of movieviewing possibilities on cable television meant the death of many additional independent theaters. While \"Rocky Horror\" soldiered on, by then a phenomenon unto itself, and new films like \"The Warriors\" (1979), \"The Gods Must Be Crazy\" (1980), \"Forbidden Zone\" (1980), \"The Evil Dead\" (1981), \"Heavy Metal\" (1981), \"Pink Floyd – The Wall\" (1982), \"Stop Making Sense\" (1984) and \"UHF\" (1989)—all from mainstream distributors—were picked up by the midnight movie circuit, the core of exhibitors that energized the movement was disappearing. By the time the fabled Orson Welles Cinema in Cambridge, Massachusetts, shut its doors after a fire in 1986, the days of the theatrical midnight movie as a significant countercultural phenomenon were already past.\n\nIn 1988, the midnight movie experience was institutionalized in a new manner with the introduction of the Toronto International Film Festival's nightly Midnight Madness section. In the years since, new or recent films still occasionally emerge as midnight movie \"hits\" on the circuit of theaters that continue to show them. The most successful of the 1990s generation was the Australian drag queen road saga \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" (1994). One of the theaters to show it regularly at midnight was New York's Waverly (also now closed), where \"Rocky Horror\" had played for a house record ninety-five weeks. A celebrated episode of television's \"The Drew Carey Show\" features a song-and-dance battle between \"Rocky Horror\" fans (led by Drew Carey) and \"Priscilla\" fans (led by Mimi Bobeck).\n\nSince the turn of the millennium, the most notable success among newly minted midnight movies has been \"Donnie Darko\" (2001). Older films are also popular on the circuit, appreciated largely in an imposed camp fashion—a midnight movie tradition that goes back to the 1972 revival of the hectoring anti-drug movie \"Reefer Madness\" (1938). (Tod Browning's 1932 horror classic \"Freaks\", the original midnight movie revival, is both too dark and too sociologically acute to readily consume as camp.) Where the irony with which \"Reefer Madness\" was adopted as a midnight favorite had its roots in a countercultural sensibility, in the latter's place there is now the parodoxical element of nostalgia: the leading revivals on the circuit currently include the crème de la crème of the John Hughes oeuvre—\"The Breakfast Club\" (1985), \"Pretty in Pink\" (1986), and \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" (1986)—and the preteen adventure film \"The Goonies\" (1985). As of late 2006, \"Rocky Horror\" itself continues to play on a weekly basis at thirty-two venues around the country, and at least once a month at about two dozen others.\n\nTwo popular midnight movies made during the phenomenon's heyday have been selected to the National Film Registry: \"Eraserhead\" (inducted 2004) and \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (inducted 2005). Midnight movie staples \"Freaks\" (1932) and \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968) were inducted in 1994 and 1997 respectively. \"Harold and Maude\", a cult film before it was adopted as a midnight movie, was also inducted in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was renamed \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\" after World War II and renumbered 8 on 23 November 1946, under Edward Thompson's LNER 1946 renumbering scheme. After nationalisation in 1948, British Railways renumbered it 60008 on 29 October 1948. It was retired from service in 1963 and was moved to the National Railroad Museum in Ashwaubenon, a suburb of Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States, where it is currently on display. It returned to England in 2012 for display at the National Railway Museum in York, when all surviving A4s were reunited. It returned to Green Bay in 2014.\n\nLike the other members of the A4 class, \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\" has carried numerous liveries during its career. When first introduced into traffic on 4 September 1937, locomotive 4496 was named \"Golden Shuttle\" and painted in LNER garter blue with stainless steel trim on the base of the valances and tender. The numbers and LNER lettering on the tender were also stainless steel. This livery design was also used on the A4s that were named after countries, on the \"Coronation\" service in order to match with the rolling stock.\n\n4496's next livery was wartime black with 'LNER' on the tender, applied 30 January 1942. This livery was modified to read just 'NE' on the tender in a repaint on 12 March 1943. LNER garter blue was reapplied 25 September 1945 and the name \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\" applied, but the name was covered until February 1946. The next livery applied was British Railways dark blue livery with black and white lining on 14 June 1950. The final livery applied was British Railways Brunswick green, applied 9 November 1951.\n\n\"Dwight D. Eisenhower\" had a non-standard red background to the nameplate c. 1958. During its time allocated to Grantham motive power depot, the name of the depot was stencilled on the buffer beam.\n\nLike all the early A4 locomotives prior to \"Mallard\", \"Golden Shuttle\" was released to service with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels. The valances were removed to aid in maintenance during a general overhaul on 30 January 1942. Experimental Automatic Train Control equipment was fitted on 23 June 1950. A double chimney and Kylchap double blastpipe was installed to help performance, during an overhaul 20 August 1958. A Smith-Stone type speed indicator was installed 30 June 1960.\n\n\"Dwight D. Eisenhower\" has had eleven boilers during its career: 8959 (from new); 8945 (from 4482 \"Golden Eagle\"), 30 January 1942; 8906 (spare) from 23 November 1946; 8955 (from 60026 \"Miles Beevor\"), 14 June 1950; 29314 (new), 9 November 1951; 29303 (from 60030 \"Guillemot\") 18 June 1954; 29296 (from 60033 \"Seagull\"), 8 July 1955; 29308 (from 60032 \"Golden Fleece\"), 20 December 1956; 29312 (from 60010 \"Dominion of Canada\"), 20 August 1958; 27964 (new), 30 June 1960 and finally 29335 (from 60019 \"Bittern\"), 17 May 1962.\n\n\"Dwight D. Eisenhower\" had two tenders during its career: 5651 from new and 5671 from 1 April 1957.\n\nLocomotive 4496 was to have been named \"Sparrow Hawk\", but was instead named \"Golden Shuttle\". \"Sparrow Hawk\" was later used on 4463. 25 September 1945 locomotive 4496 was ex-works and the next day was at Marylebone station for the directors of the LNER to view it. The nameplates were covered and it was intended that the Supreme Commander, Allied Forces would attend an official unveiling, but this could not be arranged.\n\nFrom new, \"Golden Shuttle\" was allocated to Doncaster shed for just nine days from 20–29 September 1937. It was transferred to Kings Cross Top Shed until 4 December 1939, when it was reallocated to Grantham. On 4 June 1950, \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\" was reallocated back to Top Shed. On 7 April 1957, it moved back to Grantham until it was sent back to 'Top Shed' on 15 September 1957. Its final depot allocation was New England shed in Peterborough from 16 June 1963.\n\nOn 4 October 1962, \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\" hauled a special train from Stratford station in East London to York, after being specially cleaned by Kings Cross Top Shed staff. It was withdrawn from service on 20 July 1963. By this time, the Deltic diesel electric locomotives had displaced steam from premier services, so the A4 fleet was reduced and concentrated further north. \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\" was donated to the United States of America and sent to Doncaster Works for restoration.\n\nEarmarked for the National Railroad Museum in Ashwaubenon, a suburb of Green Bay, Wisconsin, the locomotive was cosmetically restored at Doncaster Works on 19 July 1963. The following spring, it was shipped to the US, arriving in New York Harbor on 11 May 1964. Shipped by rail, it arrived at the museum later that month. In October 1990, it was moved to Abilene, Kansas for the celebrations of the centenary of Eisenhower's birth. The move both ways was done as a special train at slow speed, since the locomotive and two cars from the command train used the British vacuum braking system, which was incompatible with the American air-braked trains.\n\nThe locomotive is displayed with two British passenger carriages, once used as part of Eisenhower's Command Train. These have been restored to the condition they were in when used by Eisenhower.\n\nThere have been some efforts to repatriate the locomotive back to the UK, most of which have been unsuccessful. However, in 2012, the National Railway Museum announced plans to repatriate the engine, along with 60010, which has been preserved in Canada, as part of a plan to reunite all six preserved A4s of the class for the 75th anniversary of the class's world record breaking 126 mph run. Both 60008 and 60010 were loaned to the National Railway Museum for a period of two years, returning to North America in early 2014. While at York, the locomotive was cosmetically overhauled and received a new coat of authentic BR Brunswick Green paint to replace the inaccurate shade applied during a repaint at Green Bay. The background on the \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\" nameplates was also changed from a red colour to a black colour.\n\nIn mid-August 2012, 60008 left its base in the Green Bay area and travelled to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where it met with 60010 arriving by rail in late September. On 3 October 2012, 60008 and 60010 arrived back in the UK at the Port of Liverpool. On 4 October 2012, 60008 began its journey to the National Railway Museum Shildon, arriving that evening. The locomotive moved to York soon after for its cosmetic restoration.\nThe loco's cosmetic restoration was completed in February 2013 and the loco was then put on display in the Great Hall at the National Railway Museum in York, next to sister engine 4468 Mallard. 60008 and 4468 were later to meet up with the other four members of the class in a 2-week event at York from 3 July, called 'The Great Gathering', 75 years to the day that Mallard set the World Speed Steam record. Both 60008 and 60010 appeared at Barrow Hill Engine Shed along with \"Bittern\" (60019), as part of the 'East Coast Giants' event over the weekend of 8/9 February 2014.\n\nIn August 2013, the move of the two North American-based A4s back to the UK was the subject of an episode of the television series called Monster Moves.\n\nThe final event in which 60008 was reunited with its 5 remaining A4 sisters was the 'Great Goodbye', held between 15 and 23 February 2014, at The National Railway Museum's Locomotion annex at Shildon. During this time, the National Railroad Museum was offered US$1 million by an undisclosed buyer for the engine to remain in the UK. The museum declined the offer and the engine remained on display at Shildon until mid-April 2014. The engine, along with 60010 (which had been restored to its original number, 4489, as part of the exhibition plans) were covered in two layers of tarpaulins to protect and conceal them. In late April-early May, the covered engines were sent to the Port of Liverpool where they were loaded aboard the Atlantic Container Line's \"Atlantic Concert\" vessel for the voyage to Halifax. The engines were unloaded at the ports in Halifax on 11 May, where they were transferred on to flat cars to be taken by rail to their respective museums. 60008 arrived at the National Railroad Museum in the Green Bay suburb of Ashwaubenon on 6 June 2014 and, on 23 June, the museum had returned the engine to the display building in which it was displayed prior to leaving for the UK. The museum officially unveiled the engine as part of a new World War II themed exhibit on 2 August 2014.\n\nIn 2012 Bachmann released a model of 60008 to celebrate its return to the UK and in 2013 Hornby also released a limited edition model of 60008 along with the other 5 surviving A4s. In 2015, Hornby also released a model of it in its original garter blue livery and name, \"Golden Shuttle\".\n\n\n"}

He studied at the Qemal Stafa High School, in Tirana, Albania. In 1979 he started his studies for Albanian language and literature in the University of Tirana, where he graduated in 1983. During his studies he met his wife Xhulieta, who studied English language and literature and later became a primary school teacher. Her parents were diplomats and served among others in China and Algeria. The couple have two sons, born in the 1980s.\n\nKeko worked as a journalist for the literary newspaper \"Drita\". When the Stalinist system dissolved in early '90s, Keko joined the opposition movement and the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Albania, and was elected to Albanian parliament in March 1992. He quickly became critical of the newly elected Albanian President, Sali Berisha, whom he accused of authoritarianism. He and six others were expelled from the Democratic Party in August 1993 and, with two others who voluntarily left the party, formed the Democratic Alliance Party.\n\nKeko wrote for popular daily newspaper \"Koha Jonë\" (Our Time), strongly criticizing the first post-communist government, and later became editor of the Democratic Alliance Party newspaper \"Aleanca\" (The alliance) and of the weekly cultural and artistic magazine \"Aks\" (Axis). Together with the Albanian journalist Arben Kallamata he founded the \"Independent League of Journalists\". They also were involved in the foundation of the Albanian section of the Association of European Journalists. On March 10, 1994 Teodor Keko was assaulted by two men with brass knuckles outside his Tirana apartment and heavily injured. Keko blamed the then-government of being behind the attack. After Keko died in 2002 his wife and children moved to the Netherlands. In his honor a street in Tirana was renamed \"Rruga Teodor Keko\" (Teodor Keko Street). \nFor several years, Keko contributed to Albanian politics, and from 1992-1996 he was a member of parliament, first for the Democratic Party and, from August 1993 for the Democratic Alliance Party. Teodor Keko began publishing his first works in the 1980s when he became famous for his short stories.\n\nKeko died aged 43, shortly after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe well-known Albanian writer, politician and diplomat Besnik Mustafaj, gave the last speech. Among other things he said:\nHis first major work, the novel \"Loja\" (The game), was praised. His other works include at least fifteen volumes of poetry, novels, drama, and especially short stories. The novel \"Lajmëtarja e vdekjeve\" (The harbinger of deaths), was written during the political regime change. His last work, \"Hollësira fatale\" (Fatal details), was a bestseller in Albania in 2001. The works of Teodor Keko are being translated into English by Robert Elsie.\n\nThe young Albanian director Eno Milkani based the script of his upcoming movie \"Shenjtorja\" (\"The Saint\") on Keko's \"Dymbëdhjetë shenjtorë, një profet dhe disa njerëz\" (Twelve saints, a prophet and some people). According to Milkani, Keko's characters are \"products of a hopeless society but with a nobility that blossoms only within them who have gone through a totalitarian system.\"\n\nHis major works list includes:\n<br>Prose\n\nPoetry\n\nBeside national prizes and awards (one of each was post-mortum in 2007), a street in Tirana is named after him, \"Teodor Keko\", since 2005. The \"Prestige\" magazine published in Thessaloniki, Greece, has established an annual prize for the short story writers named after him since 2002.\n\n\n"}

Candidates must study three sections.\n\n\nThe remaining 20 hours for both SL and HL candidates comes from the internal assessment component, making a total of 150 teaching hours for SL and 240 hours for HL.\n\nThere are three assessment components at SL and four at HL.\n\n\nExternal assessment accounts for 75% of the course grade at SL and 80% at HL.\n\n\nInternal assessment accounts for the remaining 25% of the course grade at SL and 20% at HL.\n\nThe syllabus of the Economics course is divided into four sections – microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, and development economics – all of which receive approximately equal weight. All sections must be studied by all candidates, and questions of all will be posed in examinations. The Diploma programme Economics course is noted for focusing more on development than any other economics course at a pre-university level, and this is all part of the IB programmes' international perspective.\n\nThe final exams consist of three papers for HL and two for SL. Paper 1 has consisted of multiple choice questions but has now been changed to answering one question from microeconomics and one question from macroeconomics, for each section one question is worth 10 marks and the other is worth 15 marks. Paper 2 involves answering two data response questions, one from international economics and the other from development economics, each data response question is worth 20 marks. Paper 3 involves calculations (only HL is required to do this paper). Internal assessment includes three commentaries of current news items involving the use of economic concepts and terminology. The time allowed for each exam is a strict limit of 90 minutes each for Paper 1 and Paper 2 (both SL and HL) and 1 hour for Paper 3 (HL only).\n\nThe focus of this course is the systematic study of behavior and mental process. The program studies three main perspectives as influences on human behavior: the biological, the cognitive and the sociocultural. It includes the examination of optional topics that include health psychology, abnormal psychology, developmental psychology, sports psychology and psychology of human relationships. Finally all students have to carry out their own experimental study as an internal assessment.

When conducting the experiment, the IB demands that certain ethical guidelines be followed. After the experiment has been completed, a written report must be produced detailing the experiment. The students are required to The external assessment, which is administered in May or November; the second year of the course is specially focused to the development of this assessment where the students are introduced to a variety of studies and the student is expected to draw connections between them. The test is divided into two parts, which are referred to as \"papers\". Using the internal and external assessment, IB calculates a grade value of one through seven.\n\nPhilosophy is offered both as a standard and higher level Group 3 subject. It consists of both internal assignment (philosophical approach to an essay on current topic) and 2 (3 on higher level) externally assessed exam papers on core and optional topics.\n\nAll students study the core theme which consists of six key concepts:\n\nSL students are required to study one theme from the following list.\nHL students are required to study two themes from the following list. \n\nAll students are required to study one text from the “IB list of prescribed philosophical texts” shown below:\n\n\n\nThe IB Diploma Programme information technology in a global society (ITGS) course is the study and evaluation of the impacts of information technology (IT) on individuals and society.

{"id": "2078585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078585", "title": "Autotomy", "text": "Autotomy\n\nAutotomy (from the Greek \"auto-\" \"self-\" and \"tome\" \"severing\", αὐτοτομία) or self-amputation is the behaviour whereby an animal sheds or discards one or more of its own appendages, usually as a self-defense mechanism to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. Some animals have the ability to regenerate the lost body part later. Autotomy has multiple evolutionary origins and is thought to have evolved at least nine times independently in animalia.\n\nSome lizards, salamanders and tuatara when caught by the tail will shed part of it in attempting to escape. In many species the detached tail will continue to wriggle, creating a deceptive sense of continued struggle, and distracting the predator's attention from the fleeing prey animal. In addition, many species of lizards such as \"Plestiodon fasciatus\", \"Cordylosaurus subtessellatus\", \"Holaspis guentheri\", \"Phelsuma barbouri\", and \"Ameiva wetmorei\" have elaborately colored blue tails which have been shown to divert predatory attacks toward the tail and away from the body and head. Depending upon the species, the animal may be able to partially regenerate its tail, typically over a period of weeks or months. Though functional, the new tail section often is shorter and will contain cartilage rather than regenerated vertebrae of bone, and in colour and texture the skin of the regenerated organ generally differs distinctly from its original appearance. However, some salamanders can regenerate a morphologically complete and identical tail. Some reptiles such as the crested gecko do not regenerate the tail after autotomy.\n\nThe technical term for this ability to drop the tail is \"caudal autotomy\". In most lizards that sacrifice the tail in this manner, breakage occurs only when the tail is grasped with sufficient force, but some animals, such as some species of geckos, can perform true autotomy, throwing off the tail when sufficiently stressed, such as when attacked by ants.\n\nCaudal autotomy in lizards takes two forms. In the first form, called intervertebral autotomy, the tail breaks between the vertebrae. The second form of caudal autotomy is intravertebral autotomy, in which there are zones of weakness, fracture planes across each vertebra in the mid-part of the tail. In this second type of autotomy the lizard contracts a muscle to fracture a vertebra, rather than break the tail between two vertebrae. Sphincter muscles in the tail then contract around the caudal artery to minimize bleeding. Another adaptation associated with intravertebral autotomy is that skin flaps fold over the wound at the site of autotomy to readily seal the wound, which can minimize infection at the autotomy site. Caudal autotomy is prevalent among lizards; it has been recorded in 13 of approximately 20 families.\n\nCaudal autotomy is present as an anti-predator tactic but is also present in species that have high rates of intraspecific competition and aggression. The \"Agama agama\" lizard fights by using its tail as a whip against other conspecifics. It can autotomize its tail but this is met with a social cost - tail loss decreases social standing and mating ability. For example, \"Uta stansburiana\" suffers reduced social status following caudal autotomy, while \"Iberolacerta monticola\" experiences reduced mating success. Among \"Coleonyx brevis\", smaller eggs or no eggs at all are produced after the tail is lost. However, the regenerated tail in \"Agama agama\" takes on a new club-like shape providing the male with a better fighting weapon, such that autotomy and regeneration work together to increase the lizards ability to survive and reproduce. There are also examples in which salamanders will attack the tails of conspecifics in order to establish social dominance and decrease the fitness of competitors.\n\nDespite this mechanism’s effectiveness, it is also very costly and is employed only after other defenses have failed. One cost is to the immune system: tail loss results in a weakened immune system which allows for mites and other harmful organisms to have a larger negative impact on individuals and reduce their health and lifespan. Since the tail plays a significant role in locomotion and energy storage of fat deposits, it is too valuable to be dropped haphazardly. Many species have evolved specific behaviors after autotomy, such as decreased activity, in order to compensate for negative consequences such as depleted energy resources. Some such lizards, in which the tail is a major storage organ for accumulating reserves, will return to a dropped tail after the threat has passed, and will eat it to recover part of the sacrificed supplies. Conversely, some species have been observed to attack rivals and grab their tails, which they eat after their opponents flee.\n\nThere are also adaptations that help mitigate the cost of autotomy, as seen in the highly toxic salamander, \"Bolitoglossa rostrata\", in which the individual will delay autotomy until the predator moves its jaws up the tail or holds on for a long time, allowing the salamander to retain its tail when toxicity alone can ward off predators. Regeneration is one of the highest priorities after autotomy, in order to optimize locomotor performance and recoup reproductive fitness. While regenerating their tails, caudal autotomy is restored at an energetic cost that often hinders body growth or intraspecies interactions.\n\nFossils of reptiles possessing the ability to autotomize that are not within the lizard family have been found that date back to the late Carboniferous and Early Permian Epoch. Two squamate species from the Jurassic period, \"Eichstaettisaurus schroederi\" and \"Ardeosaurus digitatellus\", were identified as having intervertebral autotomy planes, and these species were placed in the squamate taxonomy as being an ancestor of current existing geckos.\n\nAt least two species of African spiny mice, \"Acomys kempi\" and \"Acomys percivali\", are capable of autotomic release of skin, e.g. upon being captured by a predator. They are the first mammals known to do so. They can completely regenerate the autotomically released or otherwise damaged skin tissue — regrowing hair follicles, skin, sweat glands, fur and cartilage with little or no scarring. It is believed that the corresponding regeneration genes could also function in humans.\n\nOver 200 species of invertebrates are capable of using autotomy as an avoidance or protective behaviour. These animals can voluntarily shed appendages when necessary for survival. Autotomy can occur in response to chemical, thermal and electrical stimulation, but is perhaps most frequently a response to mechanical stimulation during capture by a predator. Autotomy serves either to improve the chances of escape or to reduce further damage occurring to the remainder of the animal such as the spread of a chemical toxin after being stung.\n\nAutotomy occurs in some species of octopus for survival and for reproduction: the specialized reproductive arm (the hectocotylus) detaches from the male during mating and remains within the female's mantle cavity.\n\nSpecies of (land) slugs in the genus \"Prophysaon\" can self-amputate a portion of their tail. There is known autotomy of the tail of sea snail \"Oxynoe panamensis\" under persistent mechanical irritation.\n\nSome sea slugs exhibit autotomy. Both \"Discodoris lilacina\" and \"Berthella martensi\" will often drop their entire mantle skirt when handled, leading to Discodoris lilacina also being called \"Discodoris fragilis\". The members of \"Phyllodesmium\" will drop a large number of their cerata each, on the tip having a large sticky gland that secretes a sticky substance.\n\nAutotomic stone crabs are used as a self-replenishing source of food by humans, particularly in Florida. Harvesting is accomplished by removing one or both claws from the live animal and returning it to the ocean where it can regrow the lost limb(s). However, under experimental conditions, but using commercially accepted techniques, 47% of stone crabs that had both claws removed died after declawing, and 28% of single claw amputees died; 76% of the casualties died within 24 hours of declawing. The occurrence of regenerated claws in the fishery harvest is low; one study indicates less than 10%, and a more recent study indicates only 13% have regenerated claws.\n\nPost-harvest leg autotomy can be problematic in some crab and lobster fisheries, and often occurs if these crustaceans are exposed to freshwater or hypersaline water in the form of dried salt on sorting trays. The autotomy reflex in crustaceans has been proposed as an example of natural behaviour that raises questions concerning assertions on whether crustaceans can \"feel pain\", which may be based on definitions of \"pain\" that are flawed for lack of any falsifiable test, either to establish or deny the meaningfulness of the concept in this context.\n\nUnder natural conditions, orb-weaving spiders (\"Argiope\" spp.) undergo autotomy if they are stung in a leg by wasps or bees. Under experimental conditions, when spiders are injected in the leg with bee or wasp venom, they shed this appendage. But, if they are injected with only saline, they rarely autotomize the leg, indicating it is not the physical injection or the ingress of fluid \"per se\" that causes autotomy. In addition, spiders injected with venom components which cause injected humans to report pain (serotonin, histamine, phospholipase A2 and melittin) autotomize the leg, but if the injections contain venom components which do not cause pain to humans, autotomy does not occur.\n\nSometimes when honey bees (genus \"Apis\") sting a victim, the barbed stinger remains embedded. As the bee tears itself loose, the stinger takes with it the entire distal segment of the bee's abdomen, along with a nerve ganglion, various muscles, a venom sac, and the end of the bee's digestive tract.\nThis massive abdominal rupture kills the bee. Although it is widely believed that a worker honey bee can sting only once, this is a partial misconception: although the stinger is barbed so that it lodges in the victim's skin, tearing loose from the bee's abdomen and leading to its death, this only happens if the skin of the victim is sufficiently thick, such as a mammal's. The sting of a queen honey bee has no barbs, however, and does not autotomize. All species of true honey bees have this form of stinger autotomy. Two wasp species that use sting autotomy as a defense mechanism are \"Polybia rejecta \"and \"Synoeca surinama.\"\" \"\n\nThe endophallus and cornua portions of the genitalia of male honey bees (drones) also autotomize during copulation, and form a mating plug, which must be removed by the genitalia of subsequent drones if they are also to mate with the same queen. The drones die within minutes of mating.\n\nEvisceration, the ejection of the internal organs of sea cucumbers when stressed, is also a form of autotomy, and they regenerate the organ(s) lost.\n\nSome starfish shed their arms. The arm itself may even be able to regrow into a new starfish.\n\n\n"}

Built for the LNER in 1937 at Doncaster Works as works number 1866, it was originally numbered 4464. Renumbered 19 on 16 August 1946 under the LNER 1946 renumbering scheme, it was renumbered 60019 by British Railways on 10 October 1948, after nationalisation. A Pacific 4-6-2 locomotive to the same design by Nigel Gresley as the more famous A4 \"Mallard\" and one of the 35 strong class, it is one of six to survive into preservation and is one of three currently certified for mainline use.\n\nIn preservation, the locomotive has also worn the identities of a number of its scrapped classmates, including the first of the A4 class 2509 \"Silver Link\" and most recently as 4492 \"Dominion of New Zealand\".\n\nLike the other members of its class, \"Bittern\" has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released to traffic on 18 December 1937, \"Bittern\" was wearing the garter blue livery that was standard for LNER A4 Pacific locomotives at that time. On 14 November 1941 it was repainted into wartime black with LNER markings on the tender. On 22 May 1943 the tender was modified with just the markings NE. It has sometimes been said that this was to confuse wartime spies, but the generally accepted view is that it was to save scarce materials and labour by reducing the number of letters by half. It has also been said that the change was to satisfy the vanity of the new Chief Mechanical Engineer, Edward Thompson, who was a product of the former North Eastern Railway, but this claim is widely discounted. \"Bittern\" remained in black until 7 March 1947 when repainted in LNER post-war garter blue with extra red/white lining. \"Bittern\" was repainted next on 28 July 1950 into British Railways dark blue with black and white lining. The final repaint for \"Bittern\" was into British Railways green on 12 February 1952.\n\n\"Bittern\" had some livery variations applied; some of the A4s had red backgrounds applied to their nameplates, which were normally black. \"Bittern\" was seen with a red background circa 1966. The green livery had variations. Normally the boiler bands were lined out except for the firebox boiler band, which was plain green. \"Bittern\", and other Darlington based A4s received lining on the firebox boiler band as well.\n\nSome A4s had their shed name marked on the right-hand (looking from the front) buffer. \"Bittern\" was marked with Gateshead circa 1949 and Ferryhill shed (Aberdeen) later in the 1960s.\n\nLike most other A4s, \"Bittern\" was fitted with side valances and a single chimney from new. The valances were removed during an overhaul 22 September – 14 November 1941. Her double chimney with a Kylchap double blastpipe was fitted on 6 September 1957. AWS (Automatic Warning System) was fitted 13 December 1958. \"Bittern\" was fitted with a full width bogie dust shield in 1950. The speed indicator was fitted 6 September 1960.\n\n\"Bittern\" has had fourteen boilers in her career, these were: 9020 (from new), 9025 (from the 4469 \"Sir Ralph Wedgewood\" after it had been destroyed at York depot during the Baedecker air raid), 23 January 1941; 9018 (from 4462 ), 22 May 1943; 8952 (spare), 14 October 1948; 8905 (from 60011), 28 July 1950; 29317 (new build boiler), 12 February 1952; 29298 (from 60020 \"Guillemot\"), 12 June 1953; 29279 (from 60009 \"Union of South Africa\"), 30 November 1954; 29320 (from 60020 \"Guillemot\"), 25 May 1956; 29315 (from 60022 \"Mallard\"), 6 September 1957; 29319 (from 60009 \"Union of South Africa\"), 13 December 1958; 29355 (newbuild boiler), 16 March 1960; 27971 (from 60017 \"Silver Fox\"), 27 April 1962 and finally 29332 (spare), 24 March 1965.\n\n\"Bittern\" has had just one tender throughout her career: 5638, of the non-corridor design. During the major overhaul which returned the engine to traffic in 2007 the tender was rebuilt as a corridor version to allow extra flexibility of operations.\n\nInitially \"Bittern\" was based at Heaton in Newcastle and hauled the famous \"Flying Scotsman\" train on the section between London King's Cross and Newcastle. Early in her career, \"Bittern\" suffered some collision damage, necessitating a general overhaul at Doncaster Works from 3–4 January 1938. \"Bittern\" was transferred to Gateshead on 28 March 1943. With World War II, the named expresses were cut back as the country went to war. \"Bittern\" lost her garter-blue paint for a wartime black and was required to pull longer-than-normal, and therefore very heavy, passenger trains. As the war continued the A4 locomotives were also to be seen hauling heavy freight and coal trains. This was not a task that the locomotives had been built for. The heavy loads and poor maintenance conditions took their toll, and by the end of the war the A4 locomotives were in a poor state.\n\nWith the end of the war and nationalisation came better maintenance and the A4 class saw a return to the high-speed expresses of the pre-war years. Now in BR green \"Bittern\" hauled the \"Talisman\" from King's Cross to Edinburgh. \"Bittern\" was transferred to St Margarets on 28 October 1963. The A4 revival was short-lived, as the steam-pulled services were replaced by diesel-hauled services and \"Bittern\" was moved to Scotland and put into storage. After a short period \"Bittern\" was moved to Ferryhill, Aberdeen on 10 November 1963 and ran to Edinburgh and Glasgow. This service only lasted three years. \"Bittern\" has the dubious honour of heading the last A4 Glasgow to Aberdeen and thus bring the curtain down on 30 years of service.\n\nWhen she was bought for preservation, 'Bittern' had several major problems, such as the frames being cracked quite badly. These problems were known to BR, but were only lightly repaired, since with the end of steam it would have been uneconomic to completely repair the loco. This in turn affected her life in preservation and only now have the important repairs been done so that she is up to mainline standard. \"Bittern\" was withdrawn on 3 September 1966.\n\n\"Bittern\" was sold to Geoff Drury on 12 September 1966. It initially operated from York depot (site of the National Railway Museum today) on various steam charters, but the cracked frames and other symptoms of her long career soon spelled an end to her mainline career. In consequence Drury bought LNER Peppercorn Class A2 60532 Blue Peter from British Rail in 1968. \n\n\"Bittern\" and 60532 were moved to the Dinting Railway Centre, near Glossop. Neither locomotive did much running, and in late 1987 the NELPG took charge of both locomotives on long-term loan from the Drury family. While 60532 was moved to the Imperial Chemical Industries works at Wilton on Teesside, and restored to mainline running from December 1991; \"Bittern\" with its greater repair need was cosmetically restored to represent pioneer and long-gone sister 2509 \"Silver Link\". It was initially displayed at the Stephenson Railway Museum in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in this livery.\n\n\"Silver Link\" was displayed at the National Railway Museum, York and on 3 July 1988 was displayed outside with 4468 \"Mallard\" and 4498 \"Sir Nigel Gresley\". \"Mallard\" had just worked a charter train up from Doncaster, and \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" was discreetly used to make steam appear to come from \"Silver Link\" to give the impression she was in steam. 60009 \"Union of South Africa\" was unable to attend due to an overhaul. On the weekend of 5 July 2008, \"Bittern\" joined her three sisters for the first time ever on display at the National Railway Museum in York on the 70th anniversary of sister Mallard's run.\n\nIn 1995, \"Silver Link\" was moved to the Great Central Railway in Loughborough to undergo restoration to working order, but this reached only a partial stage of dismantling. In 1997, \"Bittern\" was bought by Tony Marchington, and based at the Southall Railway Centre alongside his other locomotive which was also being overhauled at the time, LNER Class A3 4472 \"Flying Scotsman\". In 2000, after the over budgeted £1million restoration of \"Flying Scotsman\" was complete, Marchington sold \"Bittern\" to Jeremy Hosking, who moved her to the Mid-Hants Railway in Hampshire in January 2001, for full restoration.\n\nOn 19 May 2007, \"Bittern\" was steamed for the first time since the 1970s. In authentic British Railways lined green livery and carrying her British Railways number, 60019, she hauled her first service train since the 1970s on 7 July 2007 after six years of restoration, numerous tests and modifications. She departed at 13:00 on 7 July 2007, during the Watercress Line's 'End of Southern Steam Gala', hauling their rake of dining coaches from Alresford to Alton. Since then she has been 'run in' and has been used on normal services, Santa specials and on 21, 22 and 23 March 2008 ran as 'Spencer' from the Thomas The Tank Engine stories during the Watercress Line's Day out with Thomas. (She was also booked as 'Spencer' from 9–17 August 2008.)\n\n\"Bittern\" was then sent to Southall depot in London, where she was configured to run with her water tender and support coach, both having originally been used with \"Flying Scotsman\". After that, she completed brake and speed tests on a run to Bristol and soon after made her official return to mainline working on Saturday 1 December 2007 on a charter from London King's Cross to York, and since then has hauled several more railtours around Britain.\nOn 25 July 2009, \"Bittern\" made a 188-mile run from King's Cross to York non-stop using a second tender to avoid the need to stop en route to take on water and change crews, carrying the headboard \"The \"Brighton Belle\"\" to publicise the launch of the \"Brighton Belle\" restoration project by the 5BEL Trust. With the first tender having a water capacity of 5,000 gallons and coal, and the second tender only used for carrying an extra 9,000 gallons of water, it was thought that this would give \"Bittern\" a range of about 250 miles; occasional stops are desirable in any case, for things such as mechanical checks and coal redistribution in the tender and firebox. A non-stop run on the East Coast Main Line had not been achieved since the 1968 King's Cross to Edinburgh hauled by 4472 \"Flying Scotsman\", also with a second tender. In June in the Top Gear Race to the North, a run using the newly built locomotive 60163 \"Tornado\" had been achieved from London to Edinburgh on the ECML with water stops but no station stops, also a first since the 1968 run of No. 4472.\n\nDuring the winter of 2010/2011 the locomotive received maintenance which included the cosmetic renaming and renumbering of the locomotive as scrapped classmate 4492 \"Dominion of New Zealand\" (BR number 60013). This conversion also included repainting the locomotive in LNER garter blue, the fitting of Gresley's original side valances (most of the valancing is from when the locomotive was masquerading as 2509 \"Silver Link\") and the painting of its wheels in their original Coronation red colouring. As the original 4492 had a New Zealand Government Railways five-chime whistle fitted shortly after its introduction to service in 1937, a suitable whistle was borrowed from the Glenbrook Vintage Railway in New Zealand.\n\nThe original \"Dominion of New Zealand\" was one of five A4s named after Commonwealth countries to pull \"The Coronation\" service, so named to celebrate the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937. Two of the five \"Coronation\"-named A4s survive in preservation - 4489 \"Dominion of Canada\" at the Canadian Railway Museum in Delson, Quebec, and 60009 \"Union of South Africa\", owned by John Cameron and which makes regular appearances on the main line.\n\nThe locomotive was due to remain in this livery for three years, however when 4464 emerged from its winter maintenance in 2012, The locomotive had reverted to its LNER identity as 4464 \"Bittern\" in gold leaf lettering.\n\nTo celebrate the 75th anniversary of sister locomotive \"Mallard\" completing its record breaking 126 mph run, \"Bittern\" ran three special charter runs along the East Coast Main Line, during which it became the first locomotive in preservation to be allowed to break the 75 mph speed limit that steam locomotives have on the UK mainline. Network Rail allowed 4464 to run up to 90 mph, as long as it passed some rigorous tests beforehand. All of these charters involved \"Bittern\" operating to and from York so it could still be displayed along with the five other preserved A4s (including \"Mallard\") at the National Railway Museum.\n\nOn 29 June 2013, \"Bittern\" set a new speed record for a British preserved steam locomotive, and according to official timers on the footplate, it achieved a maximum speed of near Arlesey, Bedfordshire on the first of its planned \"high speed\" runs, \"The Ebor Streak\" that ran from London King's Cross to York. The remaining two runs were originally scheduled for July, but the heatwave during the summer, as well as further weather issues later in the year, caused the services, the York-Newcastle \"Tyne Tees Streak\" and the York-London King's Cross \"Capital Streak\" to be rescheduled for 5 December and 7 December 2013 respectively. During the \"Tyne Tees Streak\" run, \"Bittern\" broke its own speed record set just a few months prior by reaching a maximum speed of 93 mph (149.7 km/h).\n\nIn 2014, \"Bittern\" was fitted with two commemorative plaques, similar to those worn by sister locomotives \"Mallard \"and \"Sir Nigel Gresley\", in honour of her 90 mph runs. Just prior to the expiry of its mainline certificate on 1 January 2015, the locomotive was moved again to the Mid-Hants Railway, where it ran during 2015 before being withdrawn from service for a major overhaul at LNWR, Crewe.\n\nAs of May 2018 Bittern is stored in the queue of engines awaiting workshop space, as Crewe LSL is focused on getting 60532 and 70000 back mainline.\n\nBachmann released a model of 60019 while it was still in BR Green. In 2013 Hornby released a limited edition of 1,000 models of \"Bittern\" as 60019 in Green, with double tenders, as for its non-stop run from London to York in 2009. This was followed in 2014 by a very limited edition set of the six surviving A4s as 'The Great Goodbye' collection, including \"Bittern\" as 4464 in Garter Blue and with full valances. In 2019 Hornby are releasing limited edition models of engines in the 1:1 collection, including Bittern in LNER Garter Blue with two tenders and gold lettering, as preserved. \n\n\n"}

The station is about three minutes' walk from The Mall Shopping Centre. It is situated on the Midland Main Line and is operated by Thameslink.\n\nIt was built by the Midland Railway in 1868 on its extension to St. Pancras. For some years it was known as Luton Midland Road to distinguish it from the earlier Luton Bute Street, built in 1858 on the GNR line from Hertford North to Leighton Buzzard.\n\nTo build the line a public area known as the \"Great Moor\" had to be built through. The remainder of the land was bought for development by John Crawley, who provided a replacement in what is known as the \"People's Park.\" This proved a worthwhile investment because, as the town's staple trade in straw hats diminished as they went out of fashion, it was replaced by engineering works. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the population had nearly trebled and the station had become an important stop for main line expresses.\n\nThe station, consisting of only 3 platforms was rebuilt in 1939 to the designs of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway company architect William Henry Hamlyn.\n\nIn 1960 a fourth platform was added. During electrification in the early 1980s a fifth platform was added for the suburban services to and from St. Pancras.\n\nUpon the opening of Eurostar at St. Pancras International, through-fares to continental Europe were made available from Luton and 67 other UK towns and cities to Paris, Brussels and other destinations in France and Belgium.\n\nThe station is set for significant investment from both Network Rail and First Group to improve facilities for customers as well as creating longer platforms as part of the Thameslink Programme. In 2009 the station was identified as one of the ten worst category B interchange stations for mystery shopper assessment of fabric and environment, and is set to receive a share of £50 million funding for improvements. During 2010 and 2011 a number of improvements took place at the station, these included extensions to all five platforms (including removing the barrow crossing) and a new footbridge. The platform extensions form part of the Thameslink Programme and allow 12 car operation at the station. During these works two new rail overbridges were installed over Old Bedford Road allowing the track to be slewed for the extended platforms.\n\nLuton station is served by Thameslink and East Midlands Railway trains. From Luton, trains go north to Bedford, Derby, Melton Mowbray, Corby, Leicester, Nottingham, and Sheffield. Southbound trains go to London, Gatwick Airport, Brighton, Wimbledon and Sutton.\n\nThe typical off peak service from this station as of 20 May 2018 is as follows:\n\nThameslink trains serve several stations in Central London, including London St Pancras International, Farringdon, City Thameslink, Blackfriars and London Bridge.\n\nLuton Station Interchange in front of the station building provides interchange with local and regional bus services.\n\n\nThere was previously a shuttle bus service from the station to nearby London Luton Airport. However, the dedicated shuttle ceased following the construction of Luton Airport Parkway station. There are still regular buses via the Busway to Luton Airport via Arriva’s A bus, and the Stagecoach hourly 99 bus service also runs directly to the Airport terminal.\n\nLuton station has the following facilities:\n\nOn 22 December 1955, two passenger trains collided at Luton station. One passenger was killed, and 23 injured. The first train, a local service from St Pancras to Leicester, had been given the \"right away\" from Luton and started to leave the station, but came to a halt when some late passengers attempted to board. As the train was clear of the Home signal, the signalman accepted the second train, an express from St Pancras to Derby. The signals were left at \"Danger\", so the Derby train should have stopped at the Home signal until the Leicester train had left the station. However, the driver of the Derby train failed to observe the Distant signal, and only made an emergency brake application when he saw the Home signal at danger, from a distance of approximately . He was unable to stop the train in time, and it collided with the stationary Leicester train. The rear two coaches of the Leicester train telescoped into each other, causing the majority of casualties. The official enquiry held the driver of the Derby train responsible for the collision, but also noted that the lights from the nearby Vauxhall factory obscured the view of the Distant signal. The lighting was reorganised following the accident.\n\nA passenger train being operated by a diesel multiple unit overran signals and collided with another diesel multiple unit at Luton South Signal Box. An express passenger train then collided with the wreckage, striking it with a glancing blow.\n\nOn the day of the bombings, the four suicide bombers were seen on CCTV entering the station.\n"}

The object-oriented paradigm has been adopted, which means that a CO-OPN specification is a collection of objects which interact concurrently. Cooperation between the objects is achieved by means of a synchronization mechanism, i.e., each object event may request to be synchronized with some methods (parameterized events) of one or a group of partners by means of a synchronization expression.\n\nA CO-OPN specification consists of a collection of two different modules: the abstract data type modules and the object modules. The abstract data type modules concern the data structure component of the specifications, and many sorted algebraic specifications are used when describing these modules. Furthermore, the object modules represent the concept of encapsulated entities that possess an internal state and provide the exterior with various services. For this second sort of modules, an algebraic net formalism has been adopted. Algebraic Petri nets, a kind of high level nets, are a great improvement over the Petri nets, i.e. Petri nets tokens are replaced with data structures which are described by means of algebraic abstract data types. For managing visibility, both abstract data type modules and object modules are composed of an interface (which allows some operations to be visible from the outside) and a body (which mainly encapsulates the operations properties and some operation which are used for building the model). In the case of the objects modules, the state\nand the behavior of the objects remain concealed within the body section.\n\nTo develop models using the CO-OPN language it is possible to use the COOPNBuilder framework that is an environment composed of a set of tools destinated to the support of concurrent software development based on the CO-OPN language.\n\n"}

It was released to traffic on 30 October 1937 in the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics. New numbers and letters for the tender in stainless steel were added in a general overhaul 16 January 1939. \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" was repainted into wartime black with LNER markings on 21 February 1942. The next repaint was into black with NE markings on 20 October 1943, as a cutback. After the war, \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" regained LNER garter blue livery with red/white lining on 6 March 1947.\n\nWith the formation of British Railways came new liveries and \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" was painted into British Railways dark blue with black and white lining on 27 September 1950. The final livery change was into British Railways brunswick green livery on 17 April 1952. In preservation, \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" wore garter blue (with stainless steel letters and numbers as 4498 added later) from 1966 until its overhaul in the late 1990s, when it gained its current British Railways blue livery as 60007. This livery was retained again after the 2006 overhaul.\n\nAs with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics, \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" was built with single chimney and side valances covering the wheels. The valances were removed to aid in maintenance on 21 February 1942. \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" gained its double chimney and Kylchap double blastpipe on 13 December 1957. 60007 also gained AWS equipment on 27 September 1950. A Smith-Stone type speed recorder was fitted on 30 June 1960.\n\n\"Sir Nigel Gresley\" has had twelve boilers in its career: 8961 (from new); 8946 (from 4483 \"Kingfisher\"), 21 February 1942; 9489 (new boiler), 6 March 1947; 29271 (from 60024 \"Kingfisher\"), 27 September 1950; 29319 (new build), 17 April 1952; 29306 (spare), 19 October 1953; 29321 (from 60010 \"Dominion of Canada\"), 12 March 1955; 29314 (from 60026 \"Miles Beevor\"), 13 April 1957; 29324 (from 60015 \"Quicksilver\"), 13 December 1957; 29331 (new build), 16 April 1959; 27970 (new build), 7 October 1960 and finally 27966 (from 60016 \"Silver King\"), 25 October 1962.\n\n\"Sir Nigel Gresley\" had two tenders in its career: 5329 from new build to 8 August 1943 and then 5324 from that time.\n\nBuilt for the LNER in 1937, and the 100th Gresley Pacific built. Its Doncaster Works number was 1863. It was originally numbered 4498. It is a 4-6-2 locomotive to the same design by Sir Nigel Gresley as the more famous \"Mallard\".\n\nLocomotive 4498 was actually due to receive the name \"Bittern\", originally suggested for 4492 (later \"Dominion of New Zealand\"). So the story goes, an LNER enthusiast who worked in the Railway Correspondence and Travel Society, realised in time that 4498 was the 100th Gresley Pacific locomotive and the suggestion was made that the locomotive be named after its designer. The name \"Bittern\" was later carried on 4464.\n\n\"Sir Nigel Gresley\" was allocated to Kings Cross Top Shed from new. As LNER locomotive 7, it was reallocated to Grantham on 23 April 1944, but sent back to Top Shed on 4 June 1950. Top Shed kept 60007 until the depot was closed, then \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" was reallocated to New England shed on 16 June 1963. \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" was then allocated to St Margarets shed, to work the Edinburgh - Aberdeen trains, until final shed allocation was to Aberdeen on 20 July 1964.\n\n\"Sir Nigel Gresley\" received a repaint at Doncaster Works 25 February 1938, and larger coal space was also provided as the locomotive was displayed at an exhibition in Manchester. \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" was also used for the opening of the Rugby testing station from 23 August - 8 October 1948. 60007 was placed onto the rollers without her tender and run up to high speeds to monitor the coal and water usage of the locomotive.\n\n\"Sir Nigel Gresley\" is the holder of the postwar steam record speed of gained on 23 May 1959 and carries a plaque to that effect. As with \"Mallard\"s record, this was descending southward from Stoke Summit, but unlike Mallard's run which was a special attempt, this was with a full train of passengers returning from an excursion to Doncaster works. The excursion exceeded on two other occasions on the same day. As the nominated member of the British Transport Commission's Eastern area board, Alan Pegler was on the locomotive's footplate that day.\n\nWithdrawn from service by British Railways on 1 February 1966, it was targeted by the A4 Preservation Society, which was soon renamed the A4 Locomotive Society, to rescue the locomotive from the cutter’s torch. This was achieved, and the \"Streak\" was moved to Crewe for refurbishment. Fellow A4 No 60026 Miles Beevor also subsequently visited the former LMS works after its own withdrawal, and its three pairs of 6 ft 8 in driving wheels were transferred to No. 60007 because they were in a far better condition than those on the newly saved engine.\n\nFor a long period of its preservation, \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" was kept at Steamtown Carnforth, at the old locomotive depot. This was a prime location for her mainline operations, being the only mainline A4 after 1973 other than \"Union of South Africa\". On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of \"Mallard\"'s record run on 3 July 1988, the National Railway Museum assembled three of the four UK-based A4 Pacific locomotives at the museum, the first time this had ever been done in preservation. Early in July 2008, SNG joined its three sibling-locomotives in the UK for a display at the National Railway Museum in York.\n\nDuring 1994, \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" spent some time at the Great Central Railway then at the East Lancashire Railway. The locomotive then moved to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway in 1996, and is now based there. It is owned by Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltd. and operated by the A4 Locomotive Society Ltd. on behalf of the Trust.\n\nIn 2010, \"Sir Nigel Gresley\" underwent repair at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway after its winter overhaul in 2009/10 revealed that extensive work and repair was needed on the tubing, and since then the locomotive has had two other significant mechanical failures, though these were also resolved.\n\n60007's most recent boiler ticket expired in September 2015, and the locomotive was therefore withdrawn from service for another overhaul which is being carried out in public view at the National Railway Museum in York. The boiler was sent to the Llangollen Railway for overhaul and was reunited with the locomotive frame on 7 November 2019.\n\n\"Sir Nigel Gresley\" was the first tender locomotive model released in OO gauge, and produced in both clockwork and 3-rail 12v DC electric forms by Hornby for the launch of their new system 1938. It was modelled with a heavy diecast 'Mazak' body and chassis, and finished in contemporary LNER Garter Blue livery with side skirts and tin-plate corridor tender. The casting was modified to remove the sideskirts on commencement of postwar production in 1947, when realistic Walshacerts valvegear was fitted.\n\nBachmann released several models of 60007; Weathered Single Chimney, Weathered Double Chimney and Pristine double chimney all in BR Express Passenger Blue. Hornby also released three models; one with a support coach and one without one, all having double chimneys and in BR Express Passenger Blue. Hornby sold their third model in 2013 for the Great Gathering Range along with the other surviving members of the class.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2078601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078601", "title": "Spacecraft design", "text": "Spacecraft design\n\nThe design of spacecraft covers a broad area, including the design of both robotic spacecraft (satellites and planetary probes), and spacecraft for human spaceflight (spaceships and space stations).\n\nSpacecraft design was born as a discipline in the 1950s and 60s with the advent of American and Soviet space exploration programs. Since then it has progressed, although typically less than comparable terrestrial technologies. This is for a large part due to the challenging space environment, but also to the lack of basic R&D, and to other cultural factors within the design community. On the other hand, another reason for slow space travel application design is the high energy cost, and low efficiency, for achieving orbit. This cost might be seen as too high a \"start-up-cost.\"\n\nSpacecraft design brings together aspects of various disciplines, namely:\n\n\nThe spacecraft bus carries the payload. Its subsystems support the payload and helps in pointing the payload correctly. It puts the payload in the right orbit and keeps it there. It provides housekeeping functions. It also provides orbit and attitude maintenance, electric power, command, telemetry and data handling, structure and rigidity, temperature control, data storage and communication, if required. The payload and spacecraft bus may be different units or it may be a combined one. The booster adapter provides the load-carrying interface with the vehicle (payload and spacecraft bus together).\n\nThe spacecraft may also have a propellant load, which is used to drive or push the vehicle upwards, and a propulsion kick stage. The propellant commonly used is a compressed gas like nitrogen, liquid such as monopropellant hydrazine or solid fuel, which is used for velocity corrections and attitude control. In a kick stage (also called apogee boost motor, propulsion module, or integral propulsion stage) a separate rocket motor is used to send the spacecraft into its mission orbit.\nWhile designing a spacecraft, the orbit which is going to be used should be considered into the point as it affects attitude control, thermal design, and the electric power subsystem. But these effects are secondary as compared to the effect caused on the payload due to the orbit. Thus while designing the mission; the designer selects such an orbit which increases the payload performance. The designer even calculates the required spacecraft performance characteristics such as pointing, thermal control, power quantity, and duty cycle. The spacecraft is then made, which satisfies all the requirements.\n\nThe attitude determination and control subsystem (ADCS) is used to change the attitude (orientation) of the spacecraft. There are some external torques acting on the spacecraft along the axis passing through its center of gravity which can reorient the ship in any direction or can give it a spin. The ADCS nullifies these torques by applying equal and opposite torques using the propulsion and navigation subsystems. Moment of inertia of the body is to be calculated to determine the external torques which also requires determination of vehicle's absolute attitude using sensors. The property called 'gyroscopic stiffness' is used to reduce the spinning effect.\nThe simplest spacecraft achieve control by spinning or interacting with the Earth's magnetic or gravity fields. Sometimes they are uncontrolled. Spacecraft may have several bodies or they are attached to important parts, such as solar arrays or communication antennas which need individual attitude pointing. For controlling the appendage's attitude, actuators are often used, with separate sensors and controllers.\nThe various types of control techniques used are:\n\nTelemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C) is used for communication between spacecraft and the ground systems. The subsystem functions are:\n\nThe process of sending information towards the spacecraft is called uplink or forward link and the opposite process is called downlink or return link. Uplink consists of commands and ranging tones where as downlink consists of status telemetry, ranging tones and even may include payload data. Receiver, transmitter and a wide-angle (hemispheric or omnidirectional) antenna are the main components of a basic communication subsystem. Systems with high data rates may even use a directional antenna, if required. The subsystem can provide us with the coherence between uplink and downlink signals, with the help of which we can measure range-rate Doppler shifts. The communication subsystem is sized by data rate, allowable error rate, communication path length, and RF frequency.\n\nThe vast majority of spacecraft communicate using radio antennas -- satellite communication.\nA few spacecraft communicate using lasers—either directly to the ground as with LADEE; or between satellites as with OICETS, Artemis, Alphabus, and the European Data Relay System.\n\nThe electrical power subsystem (EPS) consists of 4 subunits :\n\nThermal control subsystem (TCS) is used to maintain the temperature of all spacecraft components within certain limits. Both upper and lower limits are defined for each component. There are two limits, namely, operational (in working conditions) and survival (in non-working conditions). Temperature is controlled by using insulators, radiators, heaters, louvers and by giving proper surface finish to components.\n\nThe main function of the propulsion subsystem is to provide thrust so as to change the spacecraft's translational velocity or to apply torques to change its angular momentum. There is no requirement of thrust and hence even no requirement of propulsion equipment in a simplest spacecraft. But many of them need a controlled thrust in their system, so their design includes some form of metered propulsion (a propulsion system that can be turned on and off in small increments).\nThrusting is used for the following purposes: for changing the orbital parameters, to control attitude during thrusting, correct velocity errors, maneuver, counter disturbance forces (e.g., drag), and control and correct angular momentum. The propulsion subsystem includes a propellant, tankage, distribution system, pressurant, and propellant controls. It also includes thrusters or engines.\nSpacecraft design is always informed by the particular mission architecture of the spaceflight under consideration. Typically, a variety of mission architectures can be envisioned that would achieve the overall objective of the flight, whether those objectives be to gather scientific data or merely transport cargo across the space environment to serve any variety of purposes, governmental or economic.\n\nSpaceflight mission architectures will specify whether a spacecraft is to be autonomous or telerobotic, or even be crewed so as to deal with particular exigencies or goals of the mission. Other considerations include fast or slow trajectories, payload makeup and capacity, length of the mission, or the level of system redundancy so that the flight can achieve various degrees of fault-tolerance.\n"}

It is a 4-6-2 locomotive built to the same design by Sir Nigel Gresley as the more famous \"Mallard\". There were 35 A4 locomotives built in total. Originally numbered 4489, it was renumbered 10 on 10 May 1946, under the LNER 1946 renumbering scheme of Edward Thompson and, after nationalisation in 1948, British Railways added 60000 to its number so it became 60010 on 27 October 1948. It was renumbered back to 4489 following a cosmetic restoration at the National Railway Museum in York during late 2012 and early 2013.\n\nThe locomotive was built in Doncaster works in May 1937 as Works Number 1854. It was originally to be named \"Buzzard\" but initially received the name \"Woodcock\" instead until it was renamed \"Dominion of Canada\" by High Commissioner of Canada, H. Vincent Massey on 15 June 1937. No. 4489 underwent trials, the only one of the 'Coronation' A4s so treated, and left in works grey lined in white. It had apple green painted coupled wheels. At this point it wore the name \"Woodcock\", but this was removed before final painting and release to traffic. The Canadian Pacific Railway issue whistle was fitted 15 July 1937 for the unveiling and naming. The CPR-type bell fitted was steam operated and was actually used, as a photograph from 19 August 1939, illustrates. In 1937, locomotive 4489 was the locomotive used to try and take back the speed record previously taken by the LMS' passenger train, the Coronation Scot, which clocked at . Unfortunately, Locomotive 4489 achieved down Stoke Bank. It suffered damage in a collision at Hatfield and required attention at Doncaster Works from 31 January to 18 March 1939.\n\nAllocated to Kings Cross from new, it was reallocated to Grantham on 7 April 1957. The next shed was Kings Cross again on 15 September 1957. New England was the next allocation on 16 June 1963, after the closure of Kings Cross. The final allocation was to Aberdeen on 20 October 1963 to be used, along with other displaced A4s, primarily for the three-hour Aberdeen to Glasgow express service.\n\n\"Dominion of Canada\" has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released into traffic on 4 May 1937, No. 4489 wore the \"paint shop grey\" livery with apple green wheels until two weeks later when it was repainted in garter blue livery. The coat of arms of Canada was on the side of the cab and a CPR-type bell mounted ahead of the single chimney. As a livery variation, a stainless steel strip ran along the bottom of the valances and tender and the numbers and letters of the locomotive and tender were also stainless steel. This was due to the use of this locomotive and the other A4s named after British Commonwealth countries, on the \"Coronation\" service in order to match with the rolling stock. Other A4s named after British Commonwealth countries were (BR numbers) 60009 \"Union of South Africa\", 60011 \"Empire of India\", 60012 \"Commonwealth of Australia\" and 60013 \"Dominion of New Zealand\". The bell was removed from 60010 \"Dominion of Canada\" when the chimney was replaced with a Kylchap double blastpipe and chimney on 27 December 1957. The stainless steel strip was removed along with the valances, but was left on the tender and simply painted over. Due to the position of the cabside coat of arms, the works plates were relocated inside the cab. The coat of arms of Canada worn on the side of the cabs were removed on 8 April 1949, but the works plates remained inside the cab.\n\nThe next livery worn was wartime black with LNER on the tender on 21 February 1942. On 27 November 1943 the livery was modified to read just 'NE'. \"Dominion of Canada\" regained her LNER garter blue livery on 20 November 1947. British Railways dark blue with black and white lining was applied on 29 September 1950. The final livery change was British Railways brunswick green on 8 May 1952.\n\n\"Dominion of Canada\" had the Canadian Pacific Railway-type bell and 5-chime whistle removed in 1957 when the engine was refitted with a double chimney and kylchap exhaust to improve its steaming performance. The 5-chime whistle, which was replaced by a standard 3-chime whistle, was used at the whistles trial in Stratford for the new proposed British Railways 'Standard' Class locomotives and the bell was stored at Doncaster works.\n\n\"Dominion of Canada\" had eleven boilers throughout her career: 8952 (from new); 8908 (from 2510 \"Quicksilver\"), 21 February 1942; 9126 (from 4482 \"Golden Eagle\"), 10 May 1946; 9018 (from \"19 Bittern\"), 8 April 1949; 29273 (from 60014 \"Silver Link\"), 29 September 1950; 29321 (New build), 27 August 1953; 29323 (from 60014 \"Silver Link\"), 17 February 1955; 29312 (from 60018 \"Sparrow Hawk\"), 1 June 1956; 29272 (from 60002 \"Sir Murrough Wilson\"), 27 December 1957; 29307 (from 60028 \"Walter K. Whigham\"), 10 July 1959; and finally 27970 (from \"60007 Sir Nigel Gresley\"), 5 December 1962.\n\n\"Dominion of Canada\" had six tenders through her career: 5326 from new, 5328 from 6 December 1937, 5647 from 29 June 1953, 5639 from 9 July 1953, 5328 from 27 August 1953 and lastly 5326 from 15 October 1960.\n\n\"Dominion of Canada\" had her side valances removed on 21 February 1942. A Smith-Stone speed indicator was added on 15 October 1960.\n\n60010 \"Dominion of Canada\" was withdrawn at Darlington shed on 29 May 1965 and on 5 July 1965 was marked in Darlington's records as 'for sale to be scrapped'.\n\nAfter 60010 was condemned and her double chimney was removed for either 60024 \"Kingfisher\" or 60004 \"William Whitelaw\", both in the works at that time, she was placed behind Darlington motive power depot and forgotten. For many months it was left lying derelict, almost totally hidden in the weeds and rough bushes at the end of a siding from the MPD, nose into the embankment of the Haughton Road bridge in Darlington. Despite this being a busy main road, very few people were aware of the engine being enveloped by the undergrowth. Some time after Darlington MPD was closed on 26 March 1966, No. 60010 was moved to Crewe works for cosmetic restoration and repainted in BR Brunswick green livery due to the LNER garter blue livery's expense.\nShe was donated to the Canadian Railroad Historical Association (CRHA) by British Rail. Since May 1966, 60010 has been preserved by the CRHA at the Canadian Railway Museum at Delson/Saint-Constant, Quebec, near Montreal. The CPR bell and 5-chime whistle were shipped out with 60010, but were not refitted until its overhaul in 2012 due to the double chimney. Previously stored in a secure building with other equipment and locomotives, the engine was in a very poor cosmetic state, its front end in particular was badly damaged by a diesel engine's buckeye coupler when being moved into the building in 2008. A cosmetic restoration was originally planned for 2010, but for unknown reasons, did not go ahead.\n\nIn 2011 the National Railway Museum in York announced that it would be bringing back 60010 (along with fellow A4 \"Dwight D Eisenhower\" ) to the UK for a 2-year period to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the record-breaking run of her classmate \"Mallard\". The event marked the first time that all six surviving A4s had been together since preservation, and for 60010, marked the opportunity to reunite it with fellow Coronation engine 60009 \"Union of South Africa\".\n\nIn September 2012, 60010 was sent from the Canadian Railway Museum down to the docks in Halifax, Nova Scotia where she was reunited with 60008, and both were shipped at the end of September. After arriving back in the UK on the evening of 2 October 2012, both locomotives were unloaded the following morning at Liverpool Docks, where a press call had been arranged.\n\nOn Saturday 6 October 2012, 60010 arrived at Shildon for brief display, after which her cosmetic restoration was carried out. On 19–20 October 2012, \"Union of South Africa\" visited Shildon as well, so that a line up of three Brunswick Green A4s could take place for the first time since the end of Eastern steam in 1966 - it was originally planned to be an earlier event and also feature 60007 \"Sir Nigel Gresley\", but the A4s' shipping date was delayed, so 60007 could not be secured for the date due to commitments at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.\n\n4489's cosmetic restoration returned the locomotive to its original Coronation livery - LNER Garter Blue with her original number 4489, complete with side valances, single chimney, and stainless chrome trim, as well as chrome lettering and numbering. It was refitted with a Canadian-style chime whistle, and the commemorative bell that was originally removed when it was fitted with a double chimney and sent with the locomotive to Canada, but had not been reinstalled. The original boxes used to send the bell and bell mount to Canada were used to bring them back to the UK.\n\nIn 2013, 60010's (now renumbered 4489) cosmetic restoration was completed and she was placed on display alongside \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\" and \"Mallard\" ready for the Mallard '75 celebrations later that year, where all six preserved A4's joined the display around the turntable inside the National Railway Museum.\n\nThe story of the repatriation of Nos. 4489 and 60008 was covered in an episode of the documentary series \"Monster Moves\".\nBoth 60008 and 60010 appeared at Barrow Hill roundhouse along with Bittern (60019) as part of the \"East Coast Giants\" event over the weekend of 8/9 February 2014.\n\n4489 was reunited with her five remaining A4 sisters for the final time at The National Railway Museum's Locomotion facility at Shildon for \"The Great Goodbye\" held 15–23 February 2014. After the exhibition, the engine and 60008 remained on display at Shildon until 24 April 2014, after which the engines were covered with dual-layered tarpaulins in preparation for their return journey. In late April-early May, the covered engines were sent to Port of Liverpool where they were loaded aboard the Atlantic Container Line's \"Atlantic Concert\" vessel for the voyage to Halifax. The engines were unloaded at the ports in Halifax on 11 May, where they were transferred on to flat cars to be taken by rail to their respective museums.

The track, formerly occupied by Canadian National diesel-electric no. 6765 (which was moved to another track within the pavilion), sits atop a recessed pit, allowing visitors to view 4489's inside Gresley conjugated valve gear and her middle cylinder.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2078615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078615", "title": "British League of Racing Cyclists", "text": "British League of Racing Cyclists\n\nThe British League of Racing Cyclists (BLRC) was an association formed in 1942 to promote road bicycle racing in Great Britain. It operated in competition with the National Cyclists' Union, a rivalry which lasted until the two merged in 1959 to form the British Cycling Federation.\n\nThe National Cyclists' Union (NCU) had, since the end of the 19th century, banned racing on the roads, fearing the police would ban all cycling as a result. A call for a ban \"evoked hardly any opposition because road conditions were such that the possibility of massed racing on the highway was never even envisaged.\" \"The position of cyclists on the roads of England and Wales had not been established and police forces had objected to cyclists racing. Matters came to a head on 21 July 1894 during a timed race on the North Road, then the main road north out of London, in which 50 riders competed with the help of other riders to pace them. A group of riders passed a woman and her horse and carriage at a point about 57 miles from the capital. The horse panicked, the riders fell off and the woman complained to the local police. They in turn banned cycle-racing on their roads.\"\n\nThe NCU administered not only road racing but track racing and ruled that its clubs were to move their races off the road and on to tracks, the forerunners of modern velodromes. Some clubs did but most were too far from any track and so a rebel movement began to organise not massed, paced races but individual competitions against the clock, over standard distances and held out in the countryside, in the early hours and in secret to avoid antagonising the police.\n\nThe NCU and what became the Road Time Trials Council eventually became colleagues, each administering its own section of the sport, neither allowing massed racing.\n\nThe National Cyclists Union was the international body for cycling in England and Wales and sent teams to the Olympic Games and to world championships. It also licensed riders to compete abroad in races such as Bordeaux–Paris. But teams had to be selected not in races akin to which they were being entered but in competitions held on private roads such as airfields and car-racing courses.\n\nOne of the riders to be selected was an enthusiast from Wolverhampton, Percy Stallard. The experience of massed racing stimulated him and he believed that the NCU's objection to it on grounds that it would disrupt traffic and give cycling a bad name was pointless in wartime when petrol rationing had largely cleared the roads of vehicles.\n\nHe wrote in December 1941 to A. P. Chamberlin of the NCU:\n\nStallard protested that the airfields and car circuits which were the only place that the NCU would allow massed racing had been taken by the Army and RAF. Chamberlin was not impressed and replied at the end of January to say that the NCU had considered the question but considered it unwise.\n\nIn the first week of April Stallard sent letters on the notepaper of the bicycle shop that he ran to announce his plan for a 59-mile race from Llangollen to Wolverhampton on 7 June. \n\n\"I just explained to the police what I was doing and told them that things like that were normal on the Continent, and they said they were happy and that they'd try to help\", he said.\" He obtained sponsorship from the \"Wolverhampton Express and Star\" newspaper, offered any profits to the newspaper's Forces Comfort Fund, and recruited 40 riders to take part. He also asked the NCU and the Road Time Trials Council (RTTC) not to suspend those who took part \"as this was liable to raise controversy detrimental to the sport.\"\n\nStallard's plan brought strong opposition not just from the NCU and RTTC but from the cycling establishment, particularly from the veteran administrator and writer George Herbert Stancer. His fear, and that of the NCU, was that asking the police for permission to hold a race ended the freedom of cyclists to hold races, or at any rate lone races against the clock, without interference.\n\nUnder the headline \"A hopeless revolt\", he wrote:\n\nStancer's words influenced the NCU and it banned Stallard before the race had started. An agreement with the Road Time Trials Council meant that it too banned him.\n\nStallard went ahead and his race finished, without incident, in front of a crowd at West Park. There were 34 riders, including two Dutchmen serving in the army in Britain. The programme, priced 2d, urged: \"Onlookers are earnestly requested to remain on the pavements at all times during the race.\" It also said that \"The event is run with the kind permission of the Chief Constables of Denbighshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire and Wolverhampton.\" \"Cycling\" reported:\n\nThe report - in which the frequent mention of the police reflected the magazine's concerns as expressed by Stancer - went on to explain that the race had been banned by the NCU and the RTTC but that there had been no incidents other than a lorry backing on to the course. Fifteen riders finished and all those involved in the race were expelled from the NCU. Stallard was banned for life for refusing to account for himself to the NCU's management.\n\nThe race result:\n\n1. A. E. Price, Wolverhampton 2h 25min 40sec\n2. C. J. Anslow, Wolverhampton, at 1sec\n3. J. Holmes, RAF, at 3sec\n4. J. Kremers, Royal Dutch Brigade, at 53sec\n5. E. Whitmore, RAF, at 55sec\n6. R. Jones, Wolverhampton, at 56sec\n7. S. Trubshaw, Wolverhampton, at 1min\n8. E. Turner, Wolverhampton, at 1:05\n9. R. Whitmore, RAF, at 3:30\n10. E. Reddish, Bradford, same time\n11. J. Clark, Wolverhampton, at 3:40\n12. L. Roe, Bradford, at 3:52\n13. J. Rhodes, Bradford, at 5:49\n14. F. Beeston, Birmingham, at 7:00\n15: E. Upton, Wolverhampton, at 7:06\n\n\"When I ran the race,\" Stallard said in \"Winning\", \"I didn't think anything of it. I just thought it was something that would be taken up by others. I thought that, when the point had been proved, the NCU would be only too pleased to find that they'd got a bit of activity. It had all been above board. The police had never seen one, of course, but I just told them it was in conformity with international practice and races of this type were organised in all different countries and they had no queries at all.\"\n\nFurther races were held elsewhere in the country and the clubs that organised them formed regional groups. The first was in the Midlands in July 1942, called by the Wolverhampton RCC. With nowhere to go but insistent that massed racing was the future, Stallard encouraged the groups to merge to form the British League of Racing Cyclists. The founding meeting was of 24 people at the Sherebrook Lodge Hotel, Buxton, Derbyshire on Sunday 14 November 1942. \n\nThe founding members - they were listed by their initials rather than their names - were M. J. Gibson, S. A. Padwick, P. T. Stallard, E. F. Angrave, J. E. Finn, R.Jones, E. R. Hickman, G. Anstee, L. Plume, G. Truelove, C. J. Fox, L. Merrills, W. W. Greaves. E. Reddish, E. Thompson, R. Hartley, K. Swaby, Chas J. Fox, S. Copley, S. Cooper, K. Pattinson, G. Clark, Mrs W. W. Greaves and Miss G. A. Stiff.\n\nOther riders and then whole clubs joined the BLRC. British cycle racing became polarised, frequently bitterly so. Clubs could not affiliate to both the NCU and the BLRC; riders who raced in BLRC races were banned from NCU events and from time trials run by the Road Time Trials Council. The magazine \"Cycling\" at first refused to report BLRC events. According to John Dennis, at the time racing editor of the rival paper, \"The Bicycle\":\n\nThe BLRC itself wasn't that certain of its acceptance by the police. A sticker added to its membership licence read:\n\n\nIn 1943, the League promoted the first British national road race championship, in Harrogate and later the Brighton-Glasgow stage race - a forerunner to the \"Daily Express\" Tour of Britain first run in 1951. See main entry - Tour of Britain.\n\nThe BLRC also organised representative teams to races in other countries, although not through the international body, the Union Cycliste Internationale, by whom it wasn't recognised but through private arrangements with individuals, other breakaway organisations and sometimes through communist sports clubs which operated outside their own country's framework. From 1948 the BLRC sent a team to the Peace Race, Warsaw-Berlin-Prague, considered then the world's international amateur stage race. In 1952, Ian Steel won and Britain took the team prize. That led the UCI to recognise at least the existence of the BLRC. For the moment it said it would have to cooperate through the NCU but enthusiasts believed they had achieved international power.\n\nRepresentatives of the NCU walked out of the meeting before the vote, saying the UCI's proposal was unconstitutional. One of its delegates, H.S. Anderson said: \"There is no provision in the statute of the UCI for provisional or temporary affiliation of a national federation. The committee resolution is invalid because it violates several statutes of the UCI.\" Had they voted, the resolution would have failed.\n\nWith the BLRC now halfway through the door, Britain sent a team to the Tour de France in 1955. It was the first team ever sent since the previous riders, Bill Burl and Charles Holland had competed as private entrants before the war. To turn down the Tour was something the NCU wouldn't do and yet it couldn't select riders who were BLRC members. To leave out BLRC members, however, would be to send a weakened team and antagonise a wavering UCI. Yet the BLRC could not select a team because the Union Cycliste Internationale didn't formally recognise it. The conundrum was solved by asking a panel of newspaper reporters to do the job instead.\n\nRunning the BLRC was never easy and there were frequent rows within its administration. The organiser of the first big stage race, Jimmy Kain, wrote to Stallard after the BLRC had merged with the BCF of the \"two years of nervous and physical breakdown that followed the six years of BLRC office.\"\n\nStallard was a bright and energetic man with a vision for his sport. But he was not a man to tolerate argument or those with other views. Peter Bryan, editor of \"The Bicycle\", later an associate of \"Sporting Cyclist\" and managing editor of \"Cycling\" said: \n\nHaving achieved what he wanted, with the NCU's final acceptance of massed racing on the road, Stallard placed the continuity of the BLRC over the end of the civil war that the BLRC and the NCU had conducted. He said: \"The NCU were running road races and we were running road races and there wasn't any need for amalgamation [of the NCU and the BLRC, to form the British Cycling Federation] at all.\"\n\nCritics said Stallard had lost sight of the intention of the BLRC, which had been to bring racing to the open road and that, once achieved, that there was no further point in rival cycling administrations. Peter Bryan said: \"The BLRC was originally a gang of enthusiasts. Then along came what I'd call the parliamentarians of pedal power, men who saw a runaway organisation and decided they'd take it over.\" Stallard was influenced by those who agreed with him but in the end he and others became too much for the BLRC's other administrators and the BLRC magazine, \"The Leaguer\", reported in 1954: \"There is a malignant ulcer prevalent in the cycling world common to all three racing bodies in this country. It is the taint of vanity and culminates in the clash of personality.\"\n\nWith both the BLRC and the NCU physically and financially reeling from a civil war that had long outlasted the war with Germany, the two merged in 1959 to form the British Cycling Federation, now known as British Cycling. \n\nThe January 1959 edition of the BLRC magazine, \"The Leaguer\", reported formally:\n\nThe text accompanying the announcement said:\n\nIt also said that \"those who are predisposed to live in the past, and even the progressive League is old enough now to number several such in its ranks\", would greet the news with surprise. Stallard saw the merger as treason by \"just three people [who] were allowed the freedom to destroy the BLRC\" and until his death saw the new British Cycling Federation (BCF) as a reincarnation of the NCU. In 1989 he wrote:\n\nTo the question of whether Britain would have moved to massed racing anyway, without the BLRC, Peter Bryan says not, saying that the established cycling authorities had become entrenched in their positions, their own rivalry overshadowed by their joint fears and interests.\n\nStallard's success was that he alerted the UCI to a problem in British cycling which led the UCI to threaten Britain with exclusion from world cycling unless it sorted out the conflict between the NCU and the BLRC. Seeing the BLRC as closer to the UCI's interests, it suggested it would recognise the BLRC and not the NCU as the representative body. It was because of that that the NCU relented and agreed to license the massed races it had hitherto opposed.\n\n\"You can never say that if it didn't happen then this wouldn't have happened, but I can't see what else [other than the BLRC] would have brought it [massed racing] about,\" said Peter Bryan.\n\n"}

William De Morgan's work was inspired by Middle Eastern and particularly Iznik ceramics which created in vivid blue and green glazes. De Morgan is also credited with the rediscovery in Victorian Britain of the art of lustre glazes. Evelyn De Morgan's art is notable for her rich use of colour and her emphasis on strong female protagonists. The De Morgans were involved in the social issues of the day such as women's suffrage, and this engagement was covered by the museum.\n\nThe De Morgan Collection includes oil paintings, ceramics, drawings and archive material related to the De Morgans and their circle and it was formed by Evelyn De Morgan's sister, Mrs Wilhelmina Stirling, who wrote several books under the name A. M. W. Stirling. Mrs Stirling provided public access to the collection at her home, Old Battersea House, until her death in 1965. \n\nIn 1967 the De Morgan Foundation, a registered charity, was formed to care for the collection and parts of it were loaned to a number of locations including Cardiff Castle, Cragside in Northumberland and Knightshayes Court in Devon, all of which have interiors from the years when the De Morgans were active.\n\nFrom 2002 the De Morgan Foundation provided public access to the De Morgan Collection in a dedicated gallery named the De Morgan Centre, which was based in the former West Hill Reference Library in Wandsworth, South West London. The building dates from 1887, which was coincidentally the year in which the De Morgan's were married. The West Hill Library closed on 28 September 2007 and latterly, the De Morgan Foundation shared the building with Wandsworth Museum. Both the De Morgan Centre and Wandsworth Museum closed to the public on 28 June 2014 due to the discontinuation of their lease by the building's freeholder Wandsworth Council. \n\nSince the closure of the De Morgan Centre, the De Morgan Foundation has moved its office to the Watts Gallery at Compton near Guildford in Surrey and continues to care for and exhibit the De Morgan Collection through a series of loans, exhibitions and tours. More information on the De Morgan Collection and where it can be viewed is available on the De Morgan Foundation's website.\n\n"}

It was based on a BBC series called The Sack Race. Two contestants each reported to a new job at separate locations and figure out how to get fired as close to 3:00 p.m. as possible (the store owners are in on the gag, but the managers are not). When both contestants are fired, they report back to host Dave Holmes, and whoever was fired at the right time wins $25,000.\n\n\"Fire Me...Please\" was believed to be the first reality show to employ a laugh track. The show was also believed to be the first reality series to have one half of an episode feature a repeat, and the other half feature new material. Although critics were not overwhelmed, the series did fairly well in the 18- to 49-year-olds demographic, often placing second against the popular drama \"House\". The show was announced as one of the debut selections on CBS's Innertube website in May 2006, but never appeared on the website.\n\nThe show's on-air title was \"Fire Me Please!\" but CBS insisted the official title was \"Fire Me...Please.\"\n\nThe show is a close adaptation of a short-lived British format, \"The Sack Race\", devised by Hugh Rycroft and first broadcast on BBC Three in 2003, with a repeat run on BBC Two in 2004. (Although the show is often considered to parody the popular series \"The Apprentice\", \"The Sack Race\" in fact debuted some months earlier.) The main difference between the two versions is that the UK version was played entirely for laughs, with all of the contestants being young stand-up comedians (including an early appearance by Laura Solon), and no significant prize money at stake - the prize being merely the average daily wage for the job they took on. While \"The Sack Race\" was promoted purely as a comedy programme, \"Fire Me...Please\" was advertised as a reality television show.\n\n"}

On 10 January 1788, Bligh put his crew on three watches, giving one of them to Christian, and on 2 March 1788 promoted Christian to acting lieutenant. Some have speculated that this was the source of the ill-will that later developed between Fryer and Bligh. However, as a Master, Fryer would never have been promoted to lieutenant at sea. Indeed, he never did become a lieutenant.\n\nFryer remained loyal, and accompanied Bligh in reaching Timor.

It is a small but relatively well-equipped force whose main responsibility is to conduct search and rescue missions and to deter and defend the Brunei waters against attack mounted by sea-borne forces.\n\nThe Royal Brunei Navy was established on 14 June 1965, the second unit created after The Royal Brunei Armed Forces. The RBN is based in Muara, which is situated 4 km from Muara Town with the majority of the crews being Malays. Since 1977, The Royal Brunei Navy has been equipped with missile gun boats and other coastal patrol craft. All the ships names are prefixed KDB as in \"Kapal Diraja Brunei\" (Royal Brunei Ship in Malay). The Royal Brunei Navy has been commanded by First Admiral Pg Dato Seri Pahlawan Norazmi Pg Hj Muhammad since 13 March 2015.\n\nThe Royal Brunei Navy was formed on 14 June 1965, four years after the formation of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces. It was initially known as Boat Section of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces. Its strength was only 18 in number, including one officer from the First Battalion who had attended a basic military course in Malaya in 1961 until 1964. This Boat Section was equipped with a number of aluminium boats, known as \"Temuai\" in Malay and Fast Assault Boats (FABs). The role of the Boat Section was solely to provide transportation of infantry elements to the interior of Brunei. As the organisation expanded with the aid of stable economic growth, the Boat Section was renamed the Boat Company in 1966.\n\nThe Boat Company received 3 river patrol boats in 1966. These boats were named KDB \"Bendahara\", KDB \"Maharajalela\" and KDB \"Kermaindera\". All the ships were crewed by Bruneians, led by a qualified commanding officer. In the same year, the strength of the Boat Company was enhanced with hovercraft vessels type SR.N5, followed by SR.N6 in 1968.\n\nThe first fast patrol craft was accepted in 1968 and named KDB \"Pahlawan\". It became the first flagship for the Boat Company.\n\nThe Boat Company was reorganised as Angkatan Laut Pertama, Askar Melayu DiRaja Brunei (ALP AMDB or the First Sea Battalion, Royal Brunei Malay Regiment in Malay). It was one of the larger branches of Royal Brunei Malay Regiment. During that time, the estimated strength of Angkatan Laut Pertama, Askar Melayu DiRaja Brunei was 42 personnel including an officer, while assets consisted of one fast patrol craft, 3 river patrol boats, 2 hovercraft vessels, fast assault boats, a few long boats and \"Temuai\" (aluminium boats).\n\nIn 1971, the First Sea Battalion received two more coastal patrol craft, KDB \"Saleha\" and KDB \"Masna\".\n\nThe First Sea Battalion was reorganised again on 1 October 1991 as the Royal Brunei Navy due to the growth of the armed forces in Brunei after independence from the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2019, the RBN unveiled the Digital Disruptive Pattern BDU in digital blue colors at the 58th anniversary celebration at the Bolkiah Garrison.\n\nThe roles of the Royal Brunei Navy are:\n\nThe Royal Brunei Navy is divided into four main components as follows:\n\nThe current fleet of the Royal Brunei Navy is as follows:\n\n\nFisheries and Industry/Primary Resources ministries also operate 16m patrol boats built by Syarikat Cheoy Lee Shipyards (delivered 2002)\n\n\nThe Royal Brunei Navy is currently undergoing a large-scale modernisation, with the upgrading of the Muara Naval Base and the purchase of 3 British-built corvettes from BAE Systems Naval Ships, Scotland. The contract was awarded to GEC-Marconi in 1995 and the Nakhoda Ragam class OPVs were launched in January 2001, June 2001 and June 2002 at the then BAE Systems Marine yard at Scotstoun. These have been completed but have not been delivered from BAE Systems Naval Ships in Scotstoun due to claims by the Royal Brunei Navy that the ships fail to meet the required specifications.\n\nThe ships are armed with MBDA Exocet Block II anti-ship missiles and MBDA Seawolf surface-to-air missiles. The contract dispute is the subject of arbitration. Currently the Sultan of Brunei is intending to sell three corvettes built by BAE Systems for £600 million. When the dispute was settled, the vessels were handed over to Royal Brunei Technical Services in June 2007. In 2007, Brunei contracted the German Lürssen ship yard to find a new customer for the three ships, as of 3 May 2011 the vessels remain unsold and laid up at Barrow-in-Furness. \n\nThese ships have been purchased by the Indonesian Navy and renamed the Bung Tomo class.\n\nThe administration of First Sea Battalion moved to a new base at Jalan Tanjong Pelumpong Muara in 1974. This base is now known as the Muara Naval Base. The Muara Naval Base serves as the headquarters of the Royal Brunei Navy. It was expanded in 1997 to include facilities to support three offshore support vessels. \n\nMuara Naval Base is frequently visited by foreign warships, most notable are the frequent visits by British Royal Navy ships.\n\nThe Royal Brunei Navy and the Republic of Singapore Navy co-operate with each other through an annual joint exercise, code-named Exercise Pelican.\n\nOfficers and soldiers of the Royal Brunei Navy are also sent overseas for advanced training, generally to Australia, Brazil, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, UK and United States of America.\n\nExercise SEAGULL 03-07, which was held in Brunei from 2 to 10 September 2007 between the Royal Brunei Navy and their Philippine Navy counterparts.

Between 1986 and 1988, he served in Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's cabinet, first as Minister for External Affairs and then as Minister of Finance. He served as Governor of Andhra Pradesh from 2007 until 2011.\n\nNarayan Datt Tiwari was born to a Kumaoni family in 1925, in the village of Baluti located in Nainital district of Uttarakhand state. His father Poornanand Tiwari was an officer in the forest department, and who later resigned and joined the Non-cooperation movement. Tiwari received his education at various schools including, M.B. School, Haldwani, E.M. High School, Bareilly and C.R.S.T. High School, Nainital.\n\nHis initiation into politics came early, when during the Indian Independence movement, he was arrested on 14 December 1942 for writing Anti-British leaflets opposing imperialist policies, and sent to Nainital jail, where his father was already\nlodged. Upon his release after 15 months in 1944, he enrolled at Allahabad University, where he topped the University in M.A. (Political Science); he continued his education with an LLB from the same university, and was elected as the President of the Students’ Union of the Allahabad University in 1947.

He was elected to 7th Lok Sabha in 1980, and served as a union minister in several portfolios in the 1980s: starting with Planning, and also remained Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission. Thereafter he became a member of Rajya Sabha 1985-1988, during this period he also remained the Minister of Industries in September 1985 and in addition to that portfolio, became minister of Petroleum in 1986. He then served as India's External Affairs Minister from October 1986 until July 1987, at which point he became Minister of Finance and Commerce. He served in that position until June 1988, when he became chief minister of Uttar Pradesh for the third time.\n\nHe was an unsuccessful contender to be Prime Minister of India in the early 1990s but was pipped to the post by P. V. Narasimha Rao. In 1994, he resigned from Congress and formed his own All India Indira Congress (Tiwari) along with senior Congress leader, Arjun Singh in 1995. He joined back when Sonia Gandhi came at the helm of affairs of the party two years later, and after a devastating defeat of the party under Narasimha Rao during the general elections in 1996. Tiwari was elected to the 11th Lok Sabha in 1996, and again to the 13th Lok Sabha in 1999.\n\nHe later served as the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, which was carved out of Uttar Pradesh, from 2002 through 2007. He resigned on 5 March 2006, citing his age and left office in March 2007 following setbacks from his party in the state elections.\n\nNarayan Datt Tiwari was appointed as Governor of Andhra Pradesh on 19 August 2007 and was sworn in on 22 August. Following a controversy over his involvement in a sex scandal, he resigned as the Governor on 26 December 2009, citing \"health grounds\"; subsequently he relocated to Dehradun, Uttarakhand.\n\nOn 18 January 2017, along with his son Rohit Shekhar Tiwari (Advocate & Former Advisor, Government of Uttar Pradesh) and his wife Dr. Smt. Ujjwala Tiwari, Tiwari gave his blessings and support to Narendra Modi and the BJP for the assembly elections held in the states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh in presence of BJP President Amit Shah in the name of development.\n\nIn 1953, he married Sushila (née Sanwal), who died in 1991. \nOn 14 May 2013, he married Ujjwala Tiwari (née Singh), his longtime girlfriend and mother of his biological son Rohit Shekhar, at the age of 88.\n\nTiwari died on his 93rd birthday on 18 October 2018 in New Delhi from multiple organ failure.\n\nTiwari was involved in a sex scandal which depicted Tiwari in bed with three women at his official residence in the Raj Bhavan. A police complaint was filed against Tiwari for \"sexually abusing girls, blackmail and misuse of office\" and the Raj Bhavan staff were interrogated by police about details related to the scandal, alleged to be the result of the fallout of a mining deal. Tiwari publicly apologized, but claimed that he was being \"framed\" by \"a political conspiracy\". On 27 December 2009, E. S. L. Narasimhan was appointed to discharge the duties of governor for the region until regular arrangements for the office were made.\n\nIn 2008, Rohit Shekhar Tiwari filed a paternity suit claiming Tiwari to be his biological father. The court ordered that DNA mapping of Tiwari be done, which the court successfully compelled compliance with on 29 May 2011. On 27 July 2011, the Delhi High Court, citing a need to end the controversy, rejected a request from Tiwari's lawyers to keep his paternity test result a secret.\n\nThe DNA test results released by the court on 27 July 2011, established that Tiwari was the biological father of Rohit Shekhar Tiwari, and that Ujjwala Tiwari is the biological mother. Tiwari urged the media to respect his privacy, saying \"I have every right to live my life my way. No one has the right to look into my private life. Please respect my privacy.\" On 3 March 2013, he said \"I have accepted that Rohit Shekhar is my son. The DNA test also proved he is my biological son,\" he told \"NDTV\".\n\nOn 14 May 2013, Tiwari married Ujjwala Tiwari, Shekhar's mother, in a ceremony that took place in Lucknow. Rohit Shekhar was strangled to death on April 16, 2019 allegedly by his wife Apoorva, it is said that she pounced on him and smothered him, as he was highly intoxicated and could not resist the attack. According to Delhi Police Statement, murder was not pre-planned but happened in heat of the moment. According to his wife's testimony, their relationship was sour from the beginning of their marriage. The matter is pending before the court and at present trial is going on. \n\n"}

{"id": "2078673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078673", "title": "National Cyclists' Union", "text": "National Cyclists' Union\n\nThe National Cyclists' Union (NCU) was an association established in the Guildhall Tavern, London, on 16 February 1878 as the Bicycle Union. Its purpose was to defend cyclists and to organise and regulate bicycle racing in Great Britain. It merged with the Tricycle Association in 1882 and was renamed the National Cyclists' Union in 1883.\n\nThe National Cyclists' Union selected teams for world championships and regulated circuit and track racing in England and Wales. It was a founder member of the International Cycling Association, forerunner of the Union Cycliste Internationale, the world governing body.\n\nDuring and after the Second World War, the NCU became involved in a civil war with a rival body, the British League of Racing Cyclists, which defied the NCU's rules that massed-start races should be held on public roads only when they were closed to other traffic. The struggle between the two lasted for a decade, after which they merged to become the British Cycling Federation.\n\nThe British weekly, \"The Bicycle\", said:\n\nThe NCU erected road signs warning cyclists of steep descents and other hazards. It was prompted by a member, J George Jnr, who suggested them in 1878. The idea was taken up by the Earl of Albemarle, who became president of the NCU. The NCU shared signposting with the Cyclists Touring Club but after 10 years could no longer afford it and the CTC took on the whole job. The NCU also produced publications to help cyclists tour Britain. It ran racing championships, at first open to anyone in the world. Its championships were the world's most prestigious and considered unofficial championships of the world. The NCU, which had a strict definition of an amateur, proposed to create an International Cycling Association, open to national organisations whose views of amateurism were similar to its own, and to organise world championships. The International Cycling Union was the forerunner of the Union Cycliste Internationale.\n\nThe NCU defined amateurism in English races and banned the American sprinter, Arthur Augustus Zimmerman when he appeared to be sponsored by the Raleigh Bicycle Company. It insisted the organisers of the first Bordeaux-Paris met its own ideals before allowing British riders to take part. When George Pilkington Mills won, the NCU would not recognise the victory, or consider Mills still an amateur, until he proved he had no help from the cycle factory for which he worked.\n\nThe NCU was a founder member of the world’s first cycling authority, the International Cyclists Association. NCU championships, until 1937 open to riders from any country, had been considered the unofficial championships of the world. It was because the sport needed world championships independent of any national body that Henry Sturmey of the magazine \"The Cyclist\" and later founder of the Sturmey-Archer gear company proposed an International Cyclists Association in 1892. He approached other countries' cycling national associations through the NCU. The founding meeting was in London in November 1892, with representatives of the NCU and organisations in France, Germany, Holland, Italy and Canada.\n\nNot all were the main bodies in their home country. The largest French organisation, the Union Vélocipèdique Française, sent observers but was not allowed to take part because the NCU had broken off relationships with it over the question of amateurism. Countries objected to having one vote when Britain, with England, Scotland and Ireland each voting, had three. \n\nFrance was due to promote the world championships in Paris in 1900. It refused to accept the NCU’s position and, after failing to have the issue discussed at an ICA meeting, convened a meeting in Paris to form the Union Cycliste Internationale. Not only would it permit just one team from the United Kingdom but the NCU and Britain's other governing bodies were excluded because they had not been at the founding meeting. It took until 1903 for Britain to be admitted.\n\nThe NCU banned all cycle \"racing\" on public roads in 1890, fearing it would again jeopardise the position of other cyclists. It compelled members to hold their races on velodromes, although the word was not known then, or on closed roads such as in parks and airfields. The only races allowed on public roads were time-trials, in which riders competed against the clock at intervals, and distance and place-to-place record attempts.\n\nSuch a ban did not operate in other countries and massed road racing continued as before. That made little difference to the British because the few international events to which they sent riders, notably the Olympic and world championship road races, had been run as individual time trials. It was as a 100-mile [162 km] time-trial, in Shropshire, that Britain organised the world championship road race in 1922. Then in 1933 the UCI decided that championships would be massed-start events. The NCU organised its 1933 world championship trial as a circuit race at Brooklands near Weybridge in Surrey. This and Donington Park in the north Midlands remained the sole venues for massed start racing on mainland Britain until 1942, along with the Snaefell Mountain Course on the neighbouring Isle of Man.\n\nThe trial led to a series of races at Brooklands, organised by the Charlotteville cycling club under Bill Mills, a professional rider who founded the weekly magazine, \"The Bicycle\". Mills was one of few authorities to whom the NCU could turn for advice on road racing and it was he who wrote the NCU's rules, at the request of the secretary, H. N. Crowe.\n\nThe wording that Mills chose in 1933 led to the NCU's long civil war with a later rival body, the British League of Racing Cyclists. Mills wrote: \"No massed start race shall be permitted, other than on an enclosed circuit, unless the course is closed under statute by the competent authority, to other vehicular traffic.\" Nine years later, in October 1942 and after the BLRC had broken away from the NCU because of that insistence on closed roads, Mills regretted what he had done: \"In 1933 it was impossible to foresee the future... the war, the changing conditions on the road, the decline of track sport, the growing demand for massed start under real road conditions. My notes covered conditions as they existed in 1933.\"\n\nAt the time, said the writer and team manager Chas Messenger, \"there were thousands riding in time trials and, apart from a once-in-a-while article in the cycling press, they knew little or nothing about road racing.\" The Brooklands races inspired some riders and one, Percy Stallard, took advantage of low wartime traffic in 1942 to organise a race on the open road from Llangollen to Wolverhampton. The NCU banned him \"sine die\" - until further notice - and he and others formed the British League of Racing Cyclists as a rival.\n\nThe NCU and the BLRC (British League of Racing Cyclists) remained rivals for 17 years, a position which split British cycling. The BLRC's position was that racing on the road was not illegal, that it did not obstruct other travellers, and that it gave England and Wales the experience to compete internationally. The NCU had entrusted its wartime administration to an emergency committee which did not have power to change major rules. The journalist John Dennis said the NCU still believed that racing on the road threatened all cycling and did not want to make any change while so many members were out of the country, fighting in the war. The two sides maintained their positions when peace came in 1945 and for many years each banned the members of the other.\n\nThe rivalry ended in 1959 when the two merged to form the British Cycling Federation.\n\nThe National Cyclists' Union leased the velodrome at Herne Hill for 21 years from 25 March 1942.\n\nThe papers of the Bicycle Union and the NCU, mainly committee minutes, are held by the Modern Records Centre at the University of Warwick Library, England.\n\n"}
{"id": "2078677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078677", "title": "Orlando Figes", "text": "Orlando Figes\n\nOrlando Guy Figes ( born 1959) is a British historian and writer known for his works on Russian and European history. He is professor of history at Birkbeck College, University of London.\n\nFiges is best known for his works on Russian history, such as \"A People's Tragedy\" (1996), \"Natasha's Dance\" (2002), \"The Whisperers\" (2007), \"Crimea\" (2010) and \"Just Send Me Word\" (2012), as well as books on European history, such as \"The Europeans\" (2019). \"A People's Tragedy\" is a study of the Russian Revolution, and combines social and political history with biographical details in a historical narrative.\n\nFiges serves on the editorial board of the journal \"Russian History\", writes for the international press, broadcasts on television and radio, reviews for \"The New York Review of Books\", and is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.\n\nHis books have been translated into over thirty languages \n\nBorn in Islington, north London, in 1959, Figes is the son of John George Figes and the feminist writer Eva Figes whose Jewish family fled Nazi Germany in 1939. He attended William Ellis School in north London (1971–78) and studied History at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating with a double-starred first in 1982. He completed his PhD at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a fellow and lecturer in history from 1984 to 1999 before he succeeded Richard J. Evans as professor of history at Birkbeck College, University of London.\n\nFiges is married to human rights lawyer Stephanie Palmer, a senior lecturer in law at Cambridge University and barrister at Blackstone Chambers London. They have two daughters, Lydia and Alice. He lives in London and is a supporter of Chelsea Football Club. His elder sister was the author and editor Kate Figes.\n\nIn an interview with Andrew Marr in 1997, Figes described himself as \"a Labour Party supporter and 'a bit of a Tony Blair man', though he confessed, when it came to the revolution, to being mildly pro-Menshevik.\" \n\nOn 13 February 2017, Figes announced on Twitter that he had become a German citizen \"bec [sic] I don't want to be a Brexit Brit.\"\n\nHe divides his time between his homes in London and Umbria in Italy.\n\nFiges's first three books were on the Russian Revolution and the Civil War. \"Peasant Russia, Civil War\" (1989) was a detailed study of the peasantry in the Volga region during the Revolution and the Civil War (1917–21). Using village Soviet archives, Figes emphasised the autonomous nature of the agrarian revolution during 1917–18, showing how it developed according to traditional peasant notions of social justice independently of the Provisional Government, the Bolsheviks or other urban-based parties. He also demonstrated how the function of the rural Soviets was transformed in the course of the Civil War as they were taken over by younger and more literate peasants and migrant townsmen, many of them veterans of the First World War or Red Army soldiers, who became the rural bureaucrats of the emerging Bolshevik regime.\n\n\"A People's Tragedy\" (1996) is a panoramic history of the Revolution from 1891 to the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924. It combines social and political history and interweaves through the public narrative the personal stories of several representative figures, including Grigory Rasputin, the writer Maxim Gorky, Prince Georgy Lvov and General Alexei Brusilov, as well as unknown peasants and workers. Figes wrote that he had \"tried to present the revolution not as a march of abstract social forces and ideologies but as a human event of complicated individual tragedies\". Left-wing critics have represented Figes as a conservative because of his negative assessment of Lenin and his focus on the individual and \"the random succession of chance events\" rather than on the collective actions of the masses. Others have situated Figes among the so-called 'revisionist' historians of the Revolution who attempted to explain its political development in terms of social history. In 2008, the \"Times Literary Supplement\" listed \"A People's Tragedy\" as one of the \"hundred most influential books since the war\". In 2013 David Bowie named \"A People's Tragedy\" one of his 'top 100 books'.\n\n\"Interpreting the Russian Revolution: The Language and Symbols of 1917\" (1999), co-written with Boris Kolonitskii, analyses the political language, revolutionary songs, visual symbols and historical ideas that animated the revolutionary crowds of 1917.\n\n\"Revolutionary Russia: 1891–1991\", is a short introduction to the subject published as part of the relaunch of Pelican Books in the United Kingdom in 2014. In it Figes argues for the need to see the Russian Revolution in a longer time-frame than most historians have allowed. He states that his aim is 'to chart one hundred years of history as a single revolutionary cycle. In this telling the Revolution starts in the nineteenth century (and more specifically in 1891, when the public’s reaction to the famine crisis set it for the first time on a collision course with the autocracy) and ends with the collapse of the Soviet regime in 1991.'\n\nPublished in 2002, \"Natasha's Dance\" is a broad cultural history of Russia from the building of St. Petersburg during the reign of Peter the Great in the early eighteenth century. Taking its title from a scene in Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\", where the young countess Natasha Rostova intuitively dances a peasant dance, it explores the tensions between the European and folk elements of Russian culture, and examines how the myth of the \"Russian soul\" and the idea of \"Russianness\" itself have been expressed by Russian writers, artists, composers and philosophers.\n\nFiges is credited as the historical consultant on the 2012 film \"Anna Karenina\".\n\nFiges has also written essays on various Russian cultural figures, including Leo Tolstoy, Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev and Andrei Platonov. In 2003 he wrote and presented a TV feature documentary for the BBC, \"The Tsar's Last Picture Show\", about the pioneering colour photographer in Tsarist Russia Sergei Prokudin-Gorsky.\n\nHis book \"The Whisperers\" followed the approach of oral history. In partnership with the Memorial Society, a human rights non-profit, Figes gathered several hundred private family archives from homes across Russia and carried out more than a thousand interviews with survivors as well as perpetrators of the Stalinist repressions. Housed in the Memorial Society in Moscow, St Petersburg and Perm, many of these valuable research materials are available online.\n\nTranslated into more than twenty languages, \"The Whisperers\" was described by Andrey Kurkov as \"one of the best literary monuments to the Soviet people\" In it Figes underlined the importance of oral testimonies for the recovery of the history of repression in the former Soviet Union. While conceding that, \"like all memory, the testimony given in an interview is unreliable\", he said that oral testimony \"can be cross-examined and tested against other evidence\".\n\n\"The Whisperers\" deals mainly with the impact of repression on the private life. It examines the influence of the Soviet regime and its campaigns of Terror on family relationships, emotions and beliefs, moral choices, issues of personal and social identity, and collective memory. According to Figes, 'the real power and lasting legacy of the Stalinist system were neither in structures of the state, nor in the cult of the leader, but, as the Russian historian Mikhail Gefter once remarked, \"in the Stalinism that entered into all of us\".'\n\n\"The Whisperers\" includes a detailed study of the Soviet writer Konstantin Simonov, who became a leading figure in the Soviet Writers' Union and a propagandist in the \"anti-cosmopolitan\" campaign during Stalin's final years. Figes drew on the closed sections of Simonov's archive in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art and on the archives of the poet's wife and son to produce his study of this major Soviet establishment figure.\n\nPublished in 2012, \"Just Send Me Word\" is a true story based on 1,246 letters smuggled in and out of the Pechora labour camp between 1946 and 1955 between Lev Mishchenko (a prisoner) and Svetlana Ivanova (his girlfriend in Moscow). There are 647 letters from Lev to Svetlana, and 599 from her to him. They form part of a family archive discovered by the Memorial Society and delivered in three trunks to their Moscow offices in 2007. The letters are the largest known collection of private correspondence from the Gulag, according to Memorial.\n\nFiges was given exclusive access to the letters and other parts of the archive, which is also based on interviews with the couple when they were in their nineties, and the archives of the labour camp itself. Figes raised the finance for the transcription of the letters, which are housed in the Memorial Society in Moscow and will become available to researchers in 2013. According to Figes, \"Lev's letters are the only major real-time record of daily life in the Gulag that has ever come to light.\"\n\nThe book tells the story of Lev and Svetlana who met as students in the Physics Faculty of Moscow University in 1935. Separated by the Second World War in 1941, when Lev was enrolled in the Red Army, they made contact in 1946, when he wrote from Pechora. Figes uses the letters to explore conditions in the labour camp and to tell the love story, ending in 1955 with Lev's release and marriage to Svetlana. The book documents five illegal trips made by Svetlana to visit Lev by smuggling herself into the labour camp.\n\nThe title of the book is taken from the poem \"In Dream\" by Anna Akhmatova, translated by D.M. Thomas: \"Black and enduring separation/I share equally with you/Why weep? Give me your hand/Promise to appear in a dream again./You and I are like two mountains/And in this world we cannot meet./Just send me word/At midnight sometime through the stars.\"\n\nWriting in the \"Financial Times\", Simon Sebag Montefiore called \"Just Send Me Word\" \"a unique contribution to Gulag scholarship as well as a study of the universal power of love\". Several reviewers highlighted the book's literary qualities, pointing out that it 'reads like a novel'\n\n\"Just Send Me Word\" has been translated into German, French, Italian,Spanish, Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, Japanese, Korean and Chinese.\n\n\"\" is a panoramic history of the Crimean War of 1853–56. Drawing extensively from Russian, French and Ottoman as well as British archives, it combines military, diplomatic, political and cultural history, examining how the war left a lasting mark on the national consciousness of Britain, France, Russia and Turkey. Figes sets the war in the context of the Eastern Question, the diplomatic and political problems caused by the decay of the Ottoman Empire. In particular, he emphasises the importance of the religious struggle between Russia as the defender of the Orthodox and France as the protector of the Catholics in the Ottoman Empire. He frames the war within a longer history of religious conflict between Christians and Muslims in the Balkans, southern Russia and the Caucasus that continues to this day. Figes stresses the religious motive of the Tsar Nicholas I in his bold decision to go to war, arguing that Nicholas was swayed by the ideas of the Pan-Slavs to invade Moldavia and Wallachia and encourage Slav revolts against the Ottomans, despite his earlier adherence to the Legitimist principles of the Holy Alliance. He also shows how France and Britain were drawn into the war by popular ideas of Russophobia that swept across Europe in the wake of the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848. As one reviewer wrote, Figes shows \"how the cold war of the Soviet era froze over fundamental fault lines that had opened up in the 19th century.\"\n\n\"The Europeans: Three Lives and the Making of a Cosmopolitan Culture\" is a panoramic history of nineteenth-century European culture told through the biographies of Pauline Viardot, the opera singer, composer and salon hostess, her husband Louis Viardot, an art expert and theatre manager, and the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev, who had a long love affair with Pauline Viardot and lived with the couple in a \"ménage à trois\" for over twenty years. They lived at various times in Paris, Baden-Baden, London, Courtavenel and Bougival.\n\nFiges argues that a pan-European culture formed through new technologies (especially the railways and lithographic printing), mass foreign travel, market forces, and the development of international copyright, enabling writers, artists and composers as well as their publishers to enter foreign markets through the growth of literary translations, touring companies and international publishing. In the continent as a whole, the arts thus became \"a unifying force between nations\" leading to the emergence of a modern European 'canon' so that, by 1900, \"the same books were being read across the Continent, the same paintings reproduced, the same music played at home or heard in concert halls, and the same operas performed in all the major theatres of Europe\".\n\n\"The Europeans\" was published in the United Kingdom in September 2019. Writing in \"The Guardian\", William Boyd described it as 'magisterial, beguiling, searching, a history of a continent in constant change'. In \"The Telegraph\" Rupert Christiansen described it as 'timely, brilliant and hugely enjoyable - a magnificently humane book, written with supple grace but firmly underpinned by meticulous scholarship.'\n\nFiges has been critical of the Vladimir Putin government, in particular allegations that Putin has attempted to rehabilitate Joseph Stalin and impose his own agenda on history-teaching in Russian schools and universities. He is involved in an international summer school for history teachers in Russian universities organised by the European University of St Petersburg.\n\nOn 4 December 2008, the St Petersburg offices of the Memorial Society were raided by the police. The entire electronic archive of Memorial in St Petersburg, including the materials collected with Figes for \"The Whisperers\", was confiscated by the authorities. Figes condemned the police raid, accusing the Russian authorities of trying to rehabilitate the Stalinist regime. Figes organised an open protest letter to President Dmitry Medvedev and other Russian leaders, which was signed by several hundred leading academics from across the world. After several court hearings, the materials were finally returned to Memorial in May 2009.\n\nFiges has also condemned the arrest by the FSB of historian Mikhail Suprun as part of a \"Putinite campaign against freedom of historical research and expression\".\n\nIn December 2013, Figes wrote a long piece in the US journal \"Foreign Affairs\" on the Euromaidan demonstrations in Kiev suggesting that a referendum on Ukraine's foreign policy and the country's possible partition might be a preferable alternative to the possibility of civil war and military intervention by Russia.\n\nFiges has contributed frequently to radio and television broadcasts in the United Kingdom and around the world. In 1999 he wrote a six-part educational TV series on the history of Communism under the title \"Red Chapters\". Produced by Opus Television and broadcast in the UK, the 25-minute films featured turning-points in the history of Soviet Russia, China, and Cuba. In 2003 he wrote and presented a TV feature documentary for the BBC, \"The Tsar's Last Picture Show\", about the pioneering colour photographer in Russia Sergei Prokudin-Gorsky. In 2007 he wrote and presented two 60-minute Archive Hour programmes on radio entitled \"Stalin's Silent People\" which used recordings from his oral history project with Memorial that formed the basis of his book \"The Whisperers\". The programmes are available on Figes's website.\n\nFiges was the historical consultant on the film \"Anna Karenina\" (2012), directed by Joe Wright, starring Keira Knightley and Jude Law with a screenplay by Tom Stoppard. He was also credited as the historical consultant on the 2016 BBC \"War & Peace\" television series directed by Tom Harper with a screenplay by Andrew Davies. Interviewed by the \"Sunday Telegraph\", Figes defended the series against criticism that it was \"too Jane Austen\" and \"too English\".\n\nFiges' \"The Whisperers\" was adapted and performed by Rupert Wickham as \"Stalin's Favourite\". Based on Figes' portrayal of the writer Konstantin Simonov, the play was performed in the National Theatre in London followed by a season of performances at the Unicorn Theatre in London.\n\nIn 2010, Figes posted several pseudonymous reviews on the UK site of the online bookseller Amazon where he criticised books by two other British historians of Russia, Robert Service and Rachel Polonsky, whilst praising his own books, among others. Initially denying responsibility for the reviews, he threatened legal action against those who suggested he was their author. Figes' lawyer later issued a statement that Figes' wife had written the reviews, but in a further statement Figes admitted \"full responsibility\" for the reviews himself, agreeing to pay legal costs and damages to Polonsky and Service, who sued him for libel.\n\n\"A People's Tragedy\" was awarded the Wolfson History Prize, the WH Smith Literary Award, the NCR Book Award, the Longman-History Today Book Prize, and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. \"Natasha's Dance\" and \"The Whisperers\" were both short-listed for the Samuel Johnson Prize, making Figes the only writer to have been short-listed twice for this prize. \"The Whisperers\" was also short-listed for the Ondaatje Prize, the Prix Médicis, and the Premio Roma.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Also in the council was his friend and colleague, Karl Ulfsson av Ulvåsa, eldest son of Saint Birgitta. From 1369, during Albert of Sweden’s reign, he was \"Officialis Generalis\" (the king's highest official) and from 1371 Lord High Steward (\"drots\" in Swedish).\n\nBo Jonsson dominated the political life of Sweden and Finland for decades. He was the most influential representative to the council of aristocracy that deposed Magnus IV of Sweden in 1365 and installed Albrecht von Mecklenburg on the Swedish throne. His position as the new king's \"Officialis Generalis\" granted him vast fiscal and administrative control. By 1374, he had gained title to all of Finland. \nThe family name, \"Grip\" − which Bo Jonsson himself never used − is Swedish for \"Griffin\". A coat of arms showing a black griffin on a gold shield, attributed to Bo Jonsson, was later adopted as the coat of arms of Södermanland.\nThrough inheritance and unprejudiced methods, Bo Jonsson came to control the largest private non-royal wealth Sweden has ever seen. He usurped 1,500 farms in 350 parishes throughout Sweden, from Kalmar to Falun, through economic and political means. He became Sweden's (and Finland's) largest landowner ever. The quantity of land under his control exceeded 1/3 of the entirety of the Swedish realm, surpassing even the ruling king's national land holdings. In 1363 he was the leader of an aristocratic rebellion. He solicited support from Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg and in 1365, he became instrumental in removing Magnus Eriksson from the Swedish throne and offering it to the Duke's son.\n\nFrom the Gripsholm Castle in Mariefred, which he built, Bo Jonsson governed the entire valley of Lake Mälaren, Hälsingland, all of Finland, large parts of Västergötland, Eastern Östergötland, and the Småland coast, including the city of Kalmar. He secured the Finnish fiefs as a reward for having assisted Albert to the throne of Sweden.\n\nHe controlled a dozen fortresses, among which were Finnish Åbo Castle, Tavastehus and Viborg, Swedish Kalmar Castle and Nyköping Castle, in addition to ones built under his own direction: Bjärkaholm, Ringstaholm, and his most prized holding, Gripsholm.\n\nAs the head of the governing council and through his personal usurpation of large areas of the country, Bo Jonsson indirectly curtailed the concentration of royal power as well as German and Danish influence. However, he also solicited foreign intervention from Denmark and Mecklenburg in order to install the nobility party's puppet kings on the Swedish throne.\n\nBo Jonsson married twice during his life. His first marriage took place with the wealthy Margareta Porse, who died shortly thereafter while undergoing childbirth. He allowed the baby to be delivered via Caesarean section, though it died but one day later. \n\nHis second wife was the beautiful German Margareta Dume, who had many admirers. One of her many suitors was Karl Nilsson, a nobleman from Södermanland. Karl Nilsson was stabbed in front of the high altar at the church of the Greyfriars (Franciscans), nowadays known as Riddarholmskyrkan, in Stockholm, Sweden. Contemporary sources held Bo Jonsson to be guilty, acting in a jealous rage, but he maintained his innocence in witnessed testimonies, swearing his presence to have been elsewhere. Due to his powerful position, he was never charged. Nine days later, the estate formerly belonging to Karl Nilsson fell into the hands of Jonsson.\n\nBo Jonsson died 20 August 1386 and donated in his will a substantial part of his wealth to monasteries and churches in Sweden. In particular he gave aid to the monastery in Vadstena, operated by the Bridgittine Order and dedicated to Saint Birgitta whom Bo Jonsson had dedicated a big part of his life to get canonized. To ensure that the rest of his possessions would not fall into the hands of king Albert of Sweden whom he did not hold in very high regard he appointed a council of lords who would govern them in his name. The struggle between the king and this council concerning the huge estates he left behind would eventually lead to the Kalmar Union.\n\nBo Jonsson's first wife, who died at childbirth, bore him a son \"Jon Bosson\", who died the same day. With his second wife \"Margreta Lambrektsdotter\" (Dume), he had at least two children, history tells about his son Knut Bosson (Grip) who was once castellan of Turku castle, and daughter \"Margareta Bosdotter\" who married Detler Bylow. The second marriage possibly produced other daughters too, but they are unnamed in historical sources.\n\nHe was influential in the expansion of the medieval Finnish economy and his descendants were created barons in 1561 (see Grip av Vinäs).\n\n"}

Goulding and Pawle were living and rehearsing in a Lower Mount Street house rented by Goulding's girlfriend, \"Orphan Annie\" Mohan, which its tenants nicknamed \"The Orphanage\". Tim Booth later lived in a second Orphanage in Sandymount, Dublin. The two Orphanages became a springboard for a new generation of Irish rock, helping launch the careers of Thin Lizzy's Phil Lynott, Gary Moore and others. Percussionist/vocalist Caroline \"Linus\" Greville joined the band for two brief periods in 1968 and 1969. After signing with the Incredible String Band's producer and manager Joe Boyd, Dr Strangely Strange debuted in 1969 with \"Kip of the Serenes\". The album was produced by Boyd. Later in the year Pawle guested on the Incredible String Band's \"Changing Horses\" album. Linus was asked to leave to cut down on touring costs at the end of 1969, after some early recording sessions for the next LP. The band became popular on the UK college circuit, playing support slots the length and breadth of the UK.\n\nTheir second album, \"Heavy Petting\", was released in September 1970 and featured Gary Moore on lead guitar, with Dave Mattacks on drums. In summer 1970, at a Burton-on-Trent concert, they enlisted drummer Neil Hopwood. Goulding left at the start of 1971 to briefly study Buddhism at Samye Ling monastery and then work on his painting career. Pawle and Booth teamed with Gay Woods and Terry Woods for a six-week European tour, but Dr Strangely Strange began falling apart. The group disbanded in May 1971, after playing a concert with Al Stewart at London's Drury Lane Theatre. Booth and Pawle felt the combination was not working, and there were tensions in the band. The Woods explained: \"We said that if the Strangelies hadn't gotten it together during the time we were on the Continent then we would leave, because six weeks of gigging should pull a band tighter. Unfortunately, instead of getting together, they were getting looser\".\nThe original band reunited in 1972 for an Irish tour, and briefly reconvened in the early 1980s. During this time Goulding worked as an artist, Booth became a graphic designer and made animated films and Pawle ran a laundrette. In October 1994, the band played at the Griffin Hotel in Leeds as part of an Incredible String Band convention weekend. The band reformed, with the original trio plus fiddle/mandolin player Joe Thoma, to record a third album in 1996. Gary Moore guested again.\n\nOn 16 June 2007, the four-piece band regrouped for a Bloomsday concert at London’s 12 Bar Club to mark the launch of the archive collection \"Halcyon Days\". This was followed by a special homecoming gig in the Sugar Club on Leeson Street, Dublin, Ireland on 1 March 2008. In February 2009, Hux Records reissued \"Kip of the Serenes\" as a Collectors' Edition with four bonus tracks. \n\nOn 19 July 2009, the band participated in the Witchseason Weekender (featuring artists from Joe Boyd's Witchseason Productions company) at The Barbican, London. They performed a free concert on the foyer stage and then participated in the full Sunday evening concert entitled \"The Music of the Incredible String Band\".\n\nOctober 2011 saw the Hux re-release of \"Heavy Petting\", marked by a launch gig at London’s Jazz Café.\n\nA book about the band’s heyday, \"Dr Strangely Strange – Fitting Pieces To The Jigsaw\" (Adrian Whittaker) was published in 2019, with extensive contributions from Pawle, Booth and Goulding.\n\n\n"}

It is measured from London Paddington.\n\nIt is the fifth-busiest station in Wales, after Cardiff Central, , Newport and Swansea.\n\nThe station was opened on 18 June 1850, and both the main platform building and the 1877 pedestrian bridge are Grade II listed. The station was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel.\n\nServices on both branch lines from the station were withdrawn for a time in the 1960s & early 1970s (trains on the Vale of Glamorgan line fell victim to the Beeching cuts in June 1964, whilst Maesteg trains were withdrawn in July 1970), but because the lines remained in-situ due to coal traffic for the Aberthaw Power Station, each one has since been reopened to passenger services.\n\nPlatform 3 was a full length platform running east-to-west until the 1970s when it was removed following the closure of the Maesteg line to passenger traffic. The cafe/waiting area of platform 2 now occupies land where the track used to sit.\n\nPlatform 1A was opened in June 2005 by Andrew Davies to act as the terminus for the newly re-opened Vale of Glamorgan Line, with trains now running through to and from Aberdare.\n\nA second, and fully accessible footbridge, was built in 2012 at a cost of £2.4m and the main station ticket hall and entrance was refurbished in 2018 at a cost of £1.5million.\n\nThe station is fully staffed throughout the week, with the ticket office on platform 1 open from early morning until mid-evening (Monday to Friday: 05:45 – 19:00, Saturday: 07:00 – 19:00, Sunday: 07:40 – 19:15). A self-service ticket machine is also provided for use at other times and for the collection of pre-paid tickets. There is a waiting room and photo booth in the main building on platform 1, whist the amenities on platform 2 include toilets and a coffee shop. Train running details are offered via CIS displays, automatic announcements and timetable posters. Step-free access is available to all platforms via lifts in the accessible footbridge at the eastern end.\n\nPassenger services are operated by Great Western Railway to and from London Paddington and Swansea, with some services extended to Carmarthen; and by Transport for Wales to destinations across Wales.\n\nTo the west, Transport for Wales trains run along the South Wales Main Line and West Wales Line to Swansea and then to Carmarthen, Pembroke Dock, Milford Haven or Fishguard Harbour.\n\nMainline services to Swansea and London run hourly (with extra services at peak hours), whilst the regional trains to Manchester Piccadilly via and local trains to and over the Vale of Glamorgan Line also run hourly; the Swanline local stopping trains to/from Swansea run every two hours.\n\n\n\n\n\"Platforms 1 and 2 are full length platforms used for all long distance services on the South Wales Main Line.\"\n\n\"Platform 1A was opened in 2005 and is a bay platform which acts as the terminus for the Vale of Glamorgan Line.\n\n\"Platform 3 was briefly recommissioned in the early 2000s as an overflow bay platform facing west (it was previously the through outer face of an island platform until removal in the mid-1970s), and was used for services from , although has since fallen into non-use.\"\n\n\n"}

Quinones also went into the studio with Lou Reed around this time and cut an Anglo/French version of \"\"Sunday Morning\"\" under the name 'Vanessa St James ft Lou Reed'. The O's album was finally finished in 2005 when Pelle Gunnerfeldt (producer of The Hives) was brought in for additional production and mixes, bringing in Per Nordmark on drums and Bjorn Ytlling (of Peter Bjorn & John) for additional keyboards.

{"id": "2078745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078745", "title": "Dark Fields (album)", "text": "Dark Fields (album)\n\nDark Fields is the sixth studio album by English acoustic roots duo Show of Hands, released in 1997 on their own label Hands on Music. The album follows the duo's 1996 performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London, a performance which raised their profile. A live album of the performance was released as \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\" in August, becoming the band's best selling album. The duo followed the success with \"Dark Fields\".\n\nRecorded in St Merryn, \"Dark Fields\" features Knightley's characteristic West Country-focused lyrics and a \"live\" sound carried over from their previous studio release \"Lie of the Land\" (1995). The album was released in May 1997, received positive reviews from critics. The band also released a single from the album, \"Crazy Boy\", which was the band's first single.\n\nWith their 1995 album \"Lie of the Land\", Devon-based folk duo Show of Hands, consisting of Steve Knightley and Phil Beer, found the most success in their career so far. Whilst that album's predecessor, \"Beat about the Bush\" (1994), aimed for radio play by incorporating a full band set up, it did not receive the air play wanted. The duo then sought for a stripped down, more acoustic sound for \"Lie of the Land\" which felt more like the duo's live performances. The album was released in 1995 on Isis Records, and unlike their previous album, it found attention from major publications, such as \"Mojo\" and \"Q\", with the latter subsequently naming it the \"folk album of the year\". The duo received more attention and, by early 1996, they had by now built up a considerable fanbase through their mailing list. Knightley, Beer and manager O’Farrell, who had produced \"Lie of the Land\", took the gamble of hiring London's Royal Albert Hall for a performance on the evening of 24 March 1996, in attempt to gather all of the duo's fans, and to raise the duo's profile.\n\nWhilst a certainly ambitious idea, the duo hired the hall \"to the amusement of the media and the cynicism of sceptics\" and was considered a huge gamble. Nonetheless, the performance sold out in advance. Selling out the hall was unprecedented for a folk act. One biography said that the success \"proved that for this enigmatic, indy duo anything was possible.\" Knightley said in 1997 that \"people still talk about it in glowing terms.\" He also noted that \"quite a lot of people now know Show Of Hands as 'Those guys who did the Albert Hall'. So it's opened a lot of doors. In India there was a tremendous cachet - we were checked out by people who came to see us just because of having played the Royal Albert Hall. In America as well. So it exceeded all our expectations in that sense.\"\n\nO'Farrell commenced producing the performance as a live album, whose production work on \"Lie of the Land\" pleased the duo, who also liked the live sound of their previous live album \"Show of Hands Live\", produced by Mike Trim. The album cost £200 on the night to record. The live album was released in August 1996 as \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\", which became the duo's best-selling album. With this new tinge of success that the strength of the Albert Hall built open, Knightley noted that \"it's easier to get in local papers. But we now need to replace that with a story about the music. That's the dilemma.\" With this in mind, the duo decide it was time \"for a new studio recording\"., and the duo began work on their sixth album, \"Dark Fields\" in 1997.\n\nThe duo co-produced \"Dark Fields\" with manager Steve O'Farrell who produced \"Lie of the Land\" and \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\", and recorded it at Joe Partridge's Airfield studios in St Merryn, Cornwall, with the studio commencing recording here due to Knightley's pleasant experience when working on a Mike Silver album at the studio several years prior. Knightley later commented that, \"wonderfully equipped and utterly secluded, [the duo] locked themselves away for a week or so\" to record the album.\n\nOne reviewer noted that \"the majority of the subjects [on the album] peopling \"\"Dark Fields\"\" exude Englishness. On one hand there are the misfits - hedonistic teenager, dyed-in-the-wool poacher. Another hand highlights slave traders or recruiting sergeants - murky historical characters trapped by their time. On the third hand, the West Country's exiled miners and heroic emergency servants are given the benefit of Knightley's sympathetic pen. And on the final hand, leavening the proceedings, there are a brace of unrequited love-stories and a terrifyingly competent tune set.\" Knightley noted in 2007 that the album's production was generally based on the duo's live sound, despite being \"more rounded\", and also noted that \"many of the songs on this album are still concert standards\".\n\n\"Cousin Jack\", the opening track, remains one of the duo's best known and most performed songs. The song is about the Cornish miners of the Cornish diaspora. Many Cornish people were known as \"Cousin Jacks\". The fourth track is a \"Wessex Medley\". The twelfth track, \"High Germany/Molly Oxford\", was recorded live at Norwich in spring 1997. It is the first time the duo included a live performance on a studio album. Over half of the tracks on the album are Steve Knightley compositions, the others traditional pieces arranged by the duo, other than a cover version of Bob Dylan's \"Farewell Angelina\" and Nic Jones' arrangement of \"Warlike Lads of Russia\", a track described by one reviewer as \"just the kind of blatant altruism which Zimmerman of Hibbing notably omitted to display a few years back.\" \"The Bristol Slaver\" is about the Bristol slave trade and \"Crazy Boy\" is about a \"bored teenager\", whilst \"Longdog\" is about poachers and \"The Shout\" is about voluntary emergency services.\n\nThe album features numerous guest musicians. Chris While, of Beer's former band The Albion Band, sings vocals on the song \"Dark Fields\". Matt Clifford also plays keyboards on that track and three others. For the \"Wessex Medley\", a medley that first consists of Beer's composition \"Carrick Roads\", then \"Plum Pudding\", a traditional piece arranged by Knightley and Beer, and finally Beer's \"The Rocky Road to Chudleigh\", melodeon was provided by Simon Care. The seventh song, \"Flora\", features percussion by Joe Partridge and backing vocals from Lucy Watkins, Richard Hammond and Paul Banham who also sing backing vocals on \"The Shout\". The live track, \"High Germany\"/\"Molly Oxford\", features vocals from Kate Rusby, fiddle from Chris Wood and melodeon from Andy Cutting.\n\nOf the duo, Steve Knightley sings all lead vocals, as well as playing guitar, cuatro, mandocello, concertina, acoustic bass guitar and mandolin on the album. Meanwhile, Phil Beer sings other vocals and plays guitars, mandolin, fiddle, cuatro, viola and mandocello. This album marks the first two appearances of the song \"The Train\" on a Show of Hands studio album. Firstly appearing as the album's sixth track, it is featured again in the form of a ten-minute reprise as a hidden track following ten minutes of silence after \"High Germany\" / \"Molly Oxford\", the last track on the album. It is the first of three hidden tracks by the duo. The band's following album, \"Folk music\" features a new combination of the song with \"Blackwaterside\". The band's 2002 live album, \"Cold Cuts\" features another new combination of the song with \"Sit You Down\". The band's 2005 live album, \"As You Were\" features a new medley which features \"The Train\" followed by \"Santiago\" and \"The Soldier's Joy\".\n\nTo try and build on the duo's success, and to promote \"Dark Fields\", the duo agreed to release their first single, choosing the album's eighth track \"Crazy Boy\", backed with the B-sides \"The Train Trilogy\" and \"Crow on the Cradle\". In a 1997 interview, Steve Knightley said \"for now we're putting out the present single 'Crazy Boy' to see if we can get an Indie Chart placing or whatever - radio, TV. Maybe that will be the next story, the guys who sold 8,000 singles, or the guys who got to number 50. Whatever. That's the idea for this Autumn.\" Despite the ambitions, the single failed to chart on the UK Singles Chart. The band would not release any more singles until \"Are We Alright\"/\"Crooked River\" in 2004. This excludes the music video produced for 2003's \"Country Life\", taken from the album of the same name.\n\nAlthough the \"Crazy Boy\" single was released in Autumn 1997, \"Dark Fields\" was released several months later in December 1997. It was the first time the duo released a studio album anew on their label Hands on Music, who, prior to the release of \"Dark Fields\", had re-released \"Lie of the Land\" and released the live album, as well as 1995 compilation album \"Backlog 1987–1991\". \"Dark Fields\" was released as a digipak, their first album to do so. This package pleased reviewer Alan Rose. The album cover, which features a silhouette of a wicker man burning in front of a dark sky, was decided by the duo's long time sleeve designer Rob O'Connor and was described by Knightley in 2007 as being \"striking\". The lyric booklet refers to itself as the \"Dark Fields Song Book\".\n\n\"Dark Fields\" was released to positive reviews; Alan Rose of \"The Living Tradition\" published a positive review for the album, praising the record and highlighting \"The Warlkine Lads of Russia\" as \"rightly honoured\" and calling the tune set of the album \"terrifyingly competent.\". Dake Tuxford of the same publication, in a review for a subsequent album, described \"Dark Fields\" as a \"winning mix of Knightley's own well-crafted songs, carefully-selected material from the best contemporary songwriters and traditional material,\" and referring to the record as a \"polished\" album \"whose 'thoughtful lyricism and mood shifts' impressed even the hard-boiled \"Daily Telegraph\" reviewer.\"\n\nThe duo toured in promotion of the album, and footage from the tour featured on the duo's 1998 documentary/concert film \"Stairway to Devon\", released on VHS by Hands on Music. The film is self-described as \"world music from the West Country\". The duo would not release a studio album of new songs until \"Cold Frontier\" in September 2001. In the intervening time they recorded an album of traditional songs, \"Folk Music\" in September 1998, and an album of cover versions of songs, \"Covers\" (2000). \"Wessex Medley\" from \"Dark Fields\" was included on the various artists compilation album \"A Celebration of English Folk\" (2008).\n\nTracks written by Steve Knightley, except where noted.\n\n\"The Train (reprise)\" - 9:27 (hidden track, follows \"High Germany\" / \"Molly Oxford\")\n\n"}

It expresses the time interval in terms of UI.\n\nVery often, but not always, the UI coincides with the bit time, i.e. with the time interval taken to transmit one bit (binary information digit). \n\nThe two coincide in fact in NRZ transmission; they do not coincide in a 2B1Q transmission, where one pulse takes the time of two bits.\n\nFor example, in a serial line with a baud rate of 2.5 Gbit/s, a unit interval is 1/(2.5 Gbit/s) = 0.4 ns/baud.\n\nJitter is often measured as a fraction of UI. For example, jitter of 0.01 UI is jitter that moves a signal edge by 1% of the UI duration.\n\nThe widespread use of UI in jitter measurements comes from the need to apply the same requirements or results to cases of different symbol rates. This can be done when the phenomena investigated are not independent from the symbol duration time but closely related to it. \n\nFor example, UI is used to measure timing jitter in serial communications or in on-chip clock distributions.\n\nThis measurement unit is extensively used in jitter literature. Examples can be found in various ITU-T Recommendations, or in the tutorial from Ransom Stephens.\n\n"}

He often appeared on television shows such as \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", frequently in the guise of a heavily accented Bolivian character named José Jiménez. Dana often portrayed the Jiménez character as an astronaut.\n\nDana was born William Szathmary in Quincy, Massachusetts. He was of Hungarian Jewish descent. He took his stage name \"Dana\" after his mother's first name \"Dena\" as he felt \"Szathmary\" was unpronounceable.\n\nThe youngest of six children born to Joseph and Dena Szathmary, Dana benefited from the expertise of an older brother, Arthur, who was fluent in several languages and gave his sibling his second entry into foreign languages. The first was growing up in a polyglot neighborhood where Spanish and Italian were among the languages spoken and having a Hungarian immigrant for a father. His older brother was Irving Szathmary, composer of the \"Get Smart\" theme.\n\nDuring World War II he served in the United States Army with the 263rd Infantry Regiment, 66th Infantry Division as a 60mm mortarman and machine gunner, as well as an unofficial interpreter. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal.\n\nDana began his career as a page at NBC's famous Studio 6B while performing comedy in nightclubs around New York with partner Gene Wood. Starting in the 1950s, he appearances on television included \"The Imogene Coca Show\" and \"The Danny Thomas Show\", as well as writing for and producing \"The Spike Jones Show\".\n\nDana's career took a major turn when he began writing stand-up routines for the young comedian Don Adams, including the now well-known \"Would you believe?\" jokes popularized by \"Get Smart\". From there, he was brought in as a writer for \"The Steve Allen Show\", where he created the José Jiménez character for the show's \"Man in the Street\" segments.\n\nOn an \"Ed Sullivan Show\" appearance, Dana related a story of how a woman recognized him on the street, but knew him only as José Jiménez, and asked what his real name was. Instead of his stage name, \"Bill Dana\", he gave her his real name, \"William Szathmary\". The woman rejoined: \"Wow, no wonder you changed it to Jiménez!\"\n\nDana had several comedy albums but only one that strictly featured the Jose Jimenez character. One of the cuts; \"The Astronaut (Part 1 & 2)\"...an interview from news reporter, writer and producer Don Hinkley...made it to the Billboard Top 40 charts at #19 in September 1961. Hinkley and Dana met as writers for the Allen show.\nIn 1961, Dana made the first of eight appearances on \"The Danny Thomas Show\", playing Jimenez as a bumbling but endearing elevator operator. The character was so well-received that it was spun off into his own NBC sitcom, \"The Bill Dana Show\" (1963–1965). Jiménez was now a bellhop at a posh New York hotel. His snooty, irritable boss was played by Jonathan Harris. The cast also included Don Adams as a hopelessly inept house detective named Byron Glick; when the show was cancelled, Adams quickly used the Glick characterization as the basis for Maxwell Smart, and \"Get Smart\" premiered on NBC that fall.\n\nBefore appearing in front of a television camera for the first time on \"The Steve Allen Show\" in 1959, Dana had been a prolific comedy writer, an activity he continued into the 1980s, producing material for other actors on stage and screen. Dana co-wrote the script for the \"Get Smart\" theatrical film \"The Nude Bomb\". His brother, Irving Szathmary, wrote the theme song for the \"Get Smart\" television series.\nIn 1966, Dana wrote the animated television movie \"Alice in Wonderland (or What’s a Nice Kid Like You Doing in a Place Like This?)\", in which he also supplied the voice of The White Knight (using his Jiménez voice). That same year, the Jiménez character was animated for the Paramount cartoon \"I Want My Mummy\", written by Dana in collaboration with Howard Post. In 1966, Dana appeared uncredited in episode 48 of \"Batman\" playing José Jiménez, opening the window in the wall Batman was climbing and talking with him.\n\nIn May 1967, Dana hosted his own late-night talk show, \"The Las Vegas Show\", on the new United Network. Originated live from the Hotel Hacienda in Las Vegas, Nevada, the program was cancelled by the end of May when the United Network folded. \nJoey Forman's 1968 parody album about Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, called \"The Mashuganishi Yogi\" (\"mashugana\" meaning crazy or bizarre in Yiddish), was produced by Dana, and includes a cameo of Dana as Jiménez, as well as a cover appearance. The album is a mock news conference, an extended question-and-answer session. The ersatz Bolivian–accented Jiménez asks the ersatz Indian-accented Yogi: \"Why do you talk so funny?\"\n\nIn 1970, responding to changing times and sensitivities, Dana stopped portraying the José Jiménez character; however, he played the character again on the 1988 revival of \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\". Dana wrote the script for possibly the best known episode of the situation comedy \"All in the Family\", entitled \"Sammy's Visit\", which featured Sammy Davis Jr. In 1976, he appeared in the \"A Doctor's Doctor\" episode of the NBC situation comedy \"The Practice\" as the hospital roommate of Danny Thomas's character Dr. Jules Bedford.\n\nThe José Jiménez character was part of several scenes in the 1983 film \"The Right Stuff\". The government officials watch \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" before recruiting the Navy pilots. Sullivan is talking to Jiménez. (\"Is that your crash helmet?\" \"Oh, I \"hope\" not!\") Later during medical testing, a large, Hispanic worker (played by NFL offensive tackle Anthony Muñoz) takes offense to Alan Shepard (Scott Glenn) mimicking the Jiménez character.\n\nAlthough his film appearances were few, Dana had roles in a few movies including \"The Busy Body\" (1967), \"Harrad Summer\" (1974), \"I Wonder Who's Killing Her Now?\" (1975), and the aforementioned \"The Nude Bomb\" (1980). Dana would also have a recurring role on \"The Golden Girls\" as Sophia Petrillo's brother Angelo. He also played her father in a flashback. In addition, he played Wendell Balaban on \"Too Close for Comfort\", as well as Howie Mandel's father on the series \"St. Elsewhere\".\n\nDana reprised the role of Bernardo the servant on the CBS TV series \"Zorro and Son\", but his performance was different from Gene Sheldon's pantomime counterpart on the 1950s live-action show. Both series were produced by Walt Disney Productions.\n\nDana died on June 15, 2017 at his home in Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 92.\n\nBill Dana was integral in creating the American Comedy Archives, a series of audiovisual interviews with such comic luminaries as Phyllis Diller, Dick Gregory, Don Knotts, Norman Lear, Bob Newhart, Tom Poston, Paul Rodriguez, Dick Van Dyke, Betty White, and Jonathan Winters. The American Comedy Archives are housed at the Iwasaki Library at Emerson College, but transcripts of some interviews (Dana's included) have been made available on the library website.\n\n"}

This is also known as the Nernst effect. Conversely, when applying a current (along the y-axis) and a perpendicular magnetic field (along the z-axis) a temperature gradient appears along the x-axis. Because of the Hall effect, electrons are forced to move perpendicular to the applied current. Due to the accumulation of electrons on one side of the sample, the number of collisions increases and a heating of the material occurs.\nThis effect is quantified by the Ettingshausen coefficient \"P\", which is defined as:\n\nwhere \"dT/dx\" is the temperature gradient that results from the \"y\"-component \"J\" of an electric current density and the \"z\"-component \"B\" of a magnetic field.\n\nIn most metals like copper, silver and gold \"P\" is on the order of and thus difficult to observe in common magnetic fields.

One of his fellow pupils was the author Salman Rushdie. In his autobiography, \"Joseph Anton: A Memoir\", Rushdie believes that his bullying of Reed Herbert at Rugby may have later influenced his racist views.\n\nHaving previously been chairman of his local Young Conservatives, Reed Herbert became disillusioned with the Tories in 1972 when a Party Conference motion sponsored by Enoch Powell, condemning the government for admitting Ugandan Asian refugees, was defeated. He subsequently joined the NF and swiftly rose to the leadership. To counter accusations from the 'populist' faction of the NF that the leadership was too right wing, in June 1974 he was co-opted onto the NF's Directorate; not being tainted with a fascist past like so many of the NF leaders, he was acceptable as a moderate in the populists' eyes. As a consequence, it was Reed Herbert who cast the deciding vote which unseated John Tyndall as leader and gave the leadership to John Kingsley Read in 1974. Although he thus became associated with the populist wing of the party, he stopped short of joining the National Party when Tyndall regained control and the populists left, instead remaining within the NF. This is not to say that his views are moderate in the wider sense. He is quoted as saying: \nThe immigrants and the British are racially and genetically incompatible, which is why immigrants must be repatriated. I wish them all the luck in the world, but not here... I experience tension whenever I see a group of Indians walking down the street. I feel they are alien, a threatening presence. \n\nHe contested the Leicester East constituency for the NF in the October 1974 general election, polling 2967 votes (6%). He also stood as NF candidate in the by-election for the Birmingham Ladywood constituency on 18 August 1977, polling 888 votes (5.7%) and forcing the Liberal candidate into fourth place.\n\nIn 1979, Reed Herbert broke with the NF to lead his own British Democratic Party. He went on to merge the party into the newly formed British National Party in 1982.\n"}

It also topped the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. for eight consecutive weeks, a first for the band. This is the only song in Damon Albarn's career to reach the top 40 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It peaked in the top 10 in 17 countries, reaching No. 1 in Spain and Greece. It surpassed \"Clint Eastwood\" to become Gorillaz's most successful single worldwide. \"Feel Good Inc.\" has been certified platinum by the BPI and ARIA.\n\nThe song was listed in Pitchfork Media and \"Rolling Stone\"s Best Songs of the 2000s. It was nominated for three Grammys at the 2006 Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year, but winning for Best Pop Collaboration. Popdose ranked it 26th on their list of 100 best songs of the decade.\n\nAt the beginning of the video, while the camera is rising up from the Feel Good Inc. tower, a sample of the Spacemonkeyz dub of \"Clint Eastwood\" entitled \"A Fistful of Peanuts\" can be heard. The main themes of the video are intellectual freedom and the media's dumbing down of mass culture.\n\nIn the video, 2-D yearns for the freedom to join Noodle on her floating island. The characters lying on the floor represent those who have already been \"dumbed down\", while the band members are the ones who have awakened. 2-D is trying to wake all the people from their half-dead state by yelling at them through his megaphone, in the style of a political activist. Jamie Hewlett said in an interview that the inspiration for some scenes in the video came from Hayao Miyazaki; specifically, the windmill-powered landmass, which has been compared to that of Miyazaki's \"Castle in the Sky\". The floating island is chased by ominous helicopters, which closely resemble Korean War era Bell H-13s, monitoring the behaviour inside and ensuring that no one escapes. It is unclear whether they are preventing Noodle's escape or are chasing her away. Back in the tower, De La Soul appear as larger-than life, seemingly omnipotent images on surrounding television screens, laughing at the Gorillaz band members. Their taunting drives 2-D into a wild, hypnotic frenzy as he tries to resist the urge to be dumbed down. At the end of the video, 2-D appears beaten by his surroundings, and returns to the state he was in when the video began, repeating the words \"Feel good\" until the video finally ends, in an exact reversal of the intro. The repetition of \"Feel good\" represents that 2-D is convincing himself that everything is OK (as if he is brainwashing himself to believe it), instead of facing the harsh truth of the situation. The music video for \"El Mañana\" is a continuation of this video, depicting two helicopter gunships catching up to Noodle's floating windmill island and attacking it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His last competitive game playing football was beating Malmö FF 1-0 in the 1979 European Cup Final.\n\nAfter his playing career he was assistant manager of Sunderland from 1979 to 1982 and then became manager of Leyton Orient. Although Orient were relegated to the Fourth Division in his second season as manager, he guided them to promotion as playoff winners in 1989 and became managing director of the club two years later, with Peter Eustace being placed in charge of the first team.\n\nIn May 1993, he was appointed as Nottingham Forest manager, as a replacement for the retiring Brian Clough. Some sources have said that Clough selected Clark for the job in 1993, however Clark's name was submitted far earlier, and by the time of Clough's retirement in 1993 his preference was Ron Fenton.\n\nClough's 18-year reign as Forest manager had ended in relegation from the new FA Premier League in 1993, and Clark had to deal with the sale of two of Forest's key players - Roy Keane and Nigel Clough - for a combined total of more than £6million soon after his return to the City Ground. However, he was able to hold onto the likes of Stuart Pearce, Steve Chettle, Steve Stone and Ian Woan, and took Forest back into the Premier League at the first time of asking, as they finished runners-up in Division One.\n\nHe was also Premier League Manager of the Month for September 1994, as Forest's fine start to the season saw them in the heat of a title challenge and hopes were high that Clark could take them to the rare distinction of top division title glory a season after promotion – just as his predecessor had done 17 years earlier. Forest reached the UEFA Cup quarter finals in 1995-96 under Clark - the best run of any English side in European competitions that season.\n\nIn December 1996, with Forest struggling in the league, Clark expressed his concern with the boardroom crisis at the club, with rival parties attempting to buy the club. His earlier success with the club had led to him being linked to the England job when Terry Venables announced his intention to resign less than a year earlier. Clark left the club in December.\n\nClark made some shrewd signings as Forest manager, including Stan Collymore and Lars Bohinen. Collymore was sold to Liverpool in June 1995 for a then British transfer fee record of £8.5million, two years after joining Forest from Southend United.\n\nHowever, he also made several notably disappointing signings during his final 18 months at the City Ground. The first of these was Andrea Silenzi, who was signed as a replacement for Stan Collymore, becoming the first Italian player to appear in the Premier League, but failed to live up to expectations and had returned to Italy within two years.Croatian defender Nikola Jerkan, signed a year later, played just 14 games in Forest's 1996-97 relegation campaign, before being loaned out to Rapid Vienna for a season and then returning to the City Ground for a further season, without playing a single game, and finally being discarded by the club in the summer of 1999.\n\nClark's final managerial appointment came at Manchester City immediately after his departure from the City Ground. He arrived at Maine Road seven months after City's relegation from the Premier League, with the club in danger of a second successive relegation. Clark steered them to 14th place in Division One that season, only for City's struggles to return in 1997–98 and Clark to be sacked in February 1998, and learnt the news of his dismissal as manager while listening to the local radio at home. Clark was faced with having to halt City's decline while the club was millions of pounds debt and needing to sell its highest-paid players, including a number of disappointing signings and players who were no longer commanding regular selection in the first team. He had paid a club record £3million to bring 22-year-old striker Lee Bradbury to City from Portsmouth in July 1997, but the player failed to live up to expectations, struggling with injuries and a string of disappointing performances, and was eventually sold to Crystal Palace in October 1998. Clark's successor, Joe Royle, was unable to save City from relegation, but then guided City to back-to-back promotions.\n\nClark took over from Nigel Doughty as chairman of Nottingham Forest football club on 12 October 2011. Forest were managerless at the time, following the resignation of Steve McClaren.\n\nClark was sacked from his role as club ambassador on 17 January 2013.\n\nCrook Town\n\nNewcastle United\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

The S-Class are the flagship vehicles of Mercedes-Benz and each generation typically introduces a range of technical innovations and developments that over time will find their way into smaller cars.\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show.\n\nThe W221 S-Class' exterior styling is distinctly different from the W220. The W220 somewhat broke with tradition in being smaller than its W140 predecessor, whereas the W221 is once more larger in all dimensions than its predecessor, offers more interior space and has improved performance. The W221 looks are often said to be more imposing than those of the W220. The rear styling is similar to the Mercedes-Benz Maybach – the larger saloon from Daimler AG's other flagship brand, which was presented to the public in 1997. Development began in 1999, with the design work beginning in 2000 at the Advanced Design Center in Tokyo, and the final design by Gorden Wagener at the Sindelfingen Advanced Design Center being approved in 2001, frozen for production in early 2002 and patented in Japan on May 21, 2003 under 1208488 and in Germany on December 4, 2003. A final design prototype W221 was presented in December 2002 to Autospies journalists at a consumer design clinic, 2.5 years prior to the official production model unveiling in June 2005.\n\nInside, the W221's interior is also significantly different from the preceding model, even more dominated by leather, wood and metal. Where the W220 still had a fair amount of plastic fascias and switches, the W221 has replaced most of these by more luxurious materials such as wood, leather and metal. The interior features an instrument cluster with two large flat panel screens, one for the hard disk based COMAND system which includes the navigation screen and one replacing the analog speedometer by a graphical representation of it, which can display a range of additional information and can also be replaced by the Night View Assist display. Below the central COMAND screen are silver effect air vents, and a square, analog clock within the vents. Below the vents are metal tab switches with a black field behind them, to control the HVAC system (these functions are all also accessible via the COMAND system, which also offers access to some additional HVAC functions, such as foot-well temperature settings and air flow control).\n\nBelow the HVAC button section is a panel that opens to give access to the DVD changer which also includes a CompactFlash card reader. On the center console, a metal control wheel for the COMAND system sits above a piece of wood, surrounded by metal buttons. There is no longer a central gear shift lever as in previous models, instead a stalk on the steering wheel controls the gearbox (with buttons or, optionally, paddles on the steering wheel for manual gear control). Controls mounted on the door panels provide access to the main seat controls (including the optional seat heating, seat ventilation and memories) and to the electrical mirrors, windows and boot lid opening and closing. Additional seat controls are accessed via the standard COMAND system (these include controlling the optional multi-contour and dynamic driving seats and the massaging seat functions). Throughout the interior, many buttons are metal, with black fields above them denoting the switches' function.\nThe steering wheel has various control buttons for the cluster display, volume and telephone control and for the optional Linguatronic voice control system. On the electrically adjustable steering wheel column are also mounted the gearbox control lever, the stalk for controlling the speedtronic and cruise control functions, the main combination lever that operates the indicators, high beam and windscreen wipers and a stalk to adjust the steering wheel and control the optional heated steering wheel. Controls for the interior lighting and the sun roof or panoramic sun roof are mounted on the roof, near the interior rear-view mirror. This section also includes a compartment for sun glasses.\n\nThe W221 is slightly larger in all dimensions than the W220, with a longer wheelbase and more interior room.\n\nThe S-Class is available in short-wheelbase form, except in the US, Mexico, Russia, China and Indonesia, where all models are long-wheelbase.\n\nLike for all other S-Class generations, the W221 introduced a raft of improved and new features and systems. The standard COMAND now also controlled more of these features and/or provided access to additional settings for various functions, including the HVAC system and seat controls.\n\n\nThe W221 also contains many other safety features, including front and rear crumple zones, eight dual-stage air bags, anti-lock brakes (ABS), collapsible steering column, and traction control.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment to further refine the W221 started in 2006 with these design changes being approved in early 2007. The revised 2010 S-Class was announced on April 8, 2009 at Stuttgart. The minor model update includes minor cosmetic changes and several new features:\n\n\n\nThe updated models went on sale in June 2009. Early models included: S 350 CDI BlueEFFICIENCY, S 450 CDI, S 350, S 400 HYBRID, S 450, S 500, S 600.\n\nThe S 300L (only available in long wheelbase form) was exclusive to some Asian markets, including Singapore and Malaysia. In 2007, the retail price was S$292,888 in Singapore ($190k, all cars are extremely expensive in Singapore); in December 2013, at the end of the W221's life cycle, it was sold at RM657,218 in Malaysia.\n\nThe S 280 was sold in other markets like the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. It appears to be a short wheelbase version of the S 300L with no other significant differences.\n\nIt is a replacement of S 320 CDI with improved fuel efficiency. Changes include: on-demand electric hydraulic power steering pump, standstill decoupling for the 7G-TRONIC automatic transmission, and 17-inch light-alloy wheels with reduced rolling resistance tyres.\n\nThe German model has an MSRP of €70,864.50 (incl. VAT) for the short-wheelbase version, €78,718.50 (incl. VAT) for long-wheelbase version.\nThe S 400 BlueHybrid is a mild hybrid and the first hybrid car to adopt a lithium-ion battery. The battery pack was supplied by Continental AG and the cells were provided by Johnson Controls-Saft. The S 400 BlueHybrid was unveiled at the 2009 Chicago Auto Show. US models went on sale in August 2009, but were delivered to dealers in 2009–10. Japan models went on sale in October 2009.\n\nThe 3.5 liter V6 engine in the vehicle, combined with the hybrid system, develops and of torque. It gets in the city and on the highway.\nThe ESF 2009 Experimental Safety Vehicle is a safety research vehicle based on the S 400 Hybrid.\nThe vehicles were delivered beginning in December 2006, with MSRP of short-wheelbase model at €84,448 (net price €72,800) and the long-wheelbase model at €92,104 (net price €79,400).\nThe V8 diesel was updated to offer more power () while reducing emissions and fuel consumption. In spite of same displacement, the model designation is S 450 CDI.\n\nThe V8 diesel motors were dropped for the model year 2011 because of more powerful V6 diesel motors and because of low demand.\n\nIt is an armoured vehicle with European B6/B7 resistance level. It resists military-standard small-arms projectiles and provides protection against fragments from hand grenades and other explosive charges. Additional safety features include run-flat tyres, 90L self-sealing fuel tank and a fire-extinguishing system. Other features include Michelin PAX 245–700 R470 AC tires, optional emergency fresh-air system, pneumatic emergency control system for the power windows (operates independently of the on-board electronics), emergency boot opening facility, optional Panic Alarm System, rear camera, heated front windscreen and heated front windows, adjustable doorhold system for all four doors, rear doors that are pulled shut automatically over the last few millimetres, rear electric roller blinds. The vehicle has top speed of , with GVW of .\n\nIt was based on the Mercedes Benz S 600 L Guard, but in limousine form with an extra-long wheelbase. It includes a rear entrance with increased headroom, 4 seats behind driver partition. Other features included reinforcement of the links between the suspension components and the bodyshell, specifically targeted modification of the suspension components themselves, an additional brace (strut tower brace) between the front suspension struts, two additional steel springs at the rear to complement the air suspension, larger twin-calliper front brake discs.\n\nThe vehicles were delivered beginning in late 2008 (the first one in early part of the year for the inauguration of new Russian president Dmitry Medvedev). The production launch marked the 80th anniversary of the Mercedes-Benz special-protection unit. The President of India travels in a black Mercedes-Benz S-Class (S 600) Pullman Guard, which is stretched to limousine form and the limousine has a longer wheelbase.\n\nThe S 63 AMG is powered by the Mercedes-Benz M156 V8 engine rated at and of torque. It can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.6 seconds and has a top speed limited to .\n\nThe Interior of the S 63 AMG comes in supple German Leather, coming in the standard leather, or diamond texture, with black and chrome trim on the dash and center console (front and back row). The S 63 comes with a variety of luxury features, including but not limited to: dual-zone automatic climate control, rear-seat DVD entertainment, built-in navigation, and heated and cooled front and rear seats, to name a few in the long list of standard features.\n\nThe S 63 AMG sports an aluminum and steel body with 19\" light-alloy multispoke wheels in the front and back, shod with 255/40 tires in front, and 275/40 tires in the rear, and covered with a high-sheen finish. The S 63 w feature LED turn signals in front, and in the back, 52 LEDS form a \"C\" on both tail lights. In front, the S 63 will feature a more pronounced, arrow-shaped radiator grille, and \"6.3 AMG\" on the front wing, and newly redesigned exterior mirrors. In the rear, the S 63 will have new AMG sport exhaust with two sets of double chromed tips. The S 63 will also feature squared-off front headlamps with LED lights in addition to the traditional lights.\n\nIn 2009, the engines had reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 3%. Styling changes include arrow-shaped radiator grille, AMG-specific daytime running lights, two transverse air outlets on each side, \"6.3 AMG\" lettering on the front wings, redesigned exterior mirrors, 52-LED tail lights. Active Body Control provides crosswind stabilization as standard equipment. Torque Vectoring Brake is added. Interior include PASSION leather upholstery, AMG-specific analogue clock featuring an IWC design.\n\nThe S 65 AMG is powered by the Mercedes-Benz M275 V12 engine rated at and of torque. It includes restyled front and rear bumpers and rocker panels, larger wheels, brakes, and tires, four exhaust pipes, modified and reprogrammed suspension for sport biased handling, and various interior changes. Apart from the higher output engine, many of the AMG modifications give the S 65 AMG a distinctly different character than the S 600 base V12 model. The S65 continues to use the 5 speed transmission, because it can handle the higher torque of the engine, as opposed to the 7-speed transmission.\n\nOptional accessories include:\nThe vehicles went on sale in June 2009, with S 65 AMG available in long-wheelbase version only.\n\nThe vehicles were unveiled at the 2009 Shanghai motor show.\nMercedes unveiled the S 250 CDI BlueEFFICIENCY at the Paris Motor Show.\n\nAs the name suggests, the car is powered by a four-cylinder diesel engine which produces and of torque. Despite this relatively small engine, the S 250 accelerates from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 8.2 seconds and can reach a top speed of . Fuel consumption is 5.7 liters per 100 kilometers (41.2 mpg US), while CO2 emissions are 149 g/km.\n\nTo get those class-leading figures, Mercedes outfitted the engine with twin-turbochargers and a start/stop system. Furthermore, engineers \"extensively revised\" the seven-speed automatic transmission (called the 7G-TRONIC PLUS) for improved efficiency.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz S 250 CDI BlueEFFICIENCY won the 2012 World Green Car of the Year.\n\nThe Ocean Drive is a four-door cabriolet concept vehicle based on long-wheelbase version of S 600, but with two-tone yarn fabric roof. The vehicle features an oversized grille, redesigned LED headlights and restyled trunk, LED head and tail lamps, a revised air dam, restyled flanks without the wheelhouse bulges, door handles that fit flush into the body, AIRSCARF neck-level heating system, on all 4 seats. The car also contains pillarless windows that provide an unobstructed view for occupants when the large soft top is down.\n\nOther features include aluminum wheels with 275/35ZR21 tires.\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled at the 2007 NAIAS.\nS 280 is only sold in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Asia(badged as S 300)\n\nS 350 CDI 4MATIC is badged as S 350 CDI 4MATIC BlueEFFICIENCY in Germany.\n\nS 500 is badged as S 550 in Canada, US and Japan market.\n\nAll models with the exception of the S600 are equipped with the 7G-TRONIC transmission. S350, S350 4MATIC, S400 Hybrid, S450, S450 4MATIC, S500 include 7G-TRONIC Sport transmission. Models with 7G-TRONIC transmission include DIRECT SELECT, which allows 7G-TRONIC to be electronically controlled by touching the lever on the right-hand side of the steering column.\n\nThe S600 retains the 5G-TRONIC automatic transmission.

{"id": "2078906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078906", "title": "Erwin Chemerinsky", "text": "Erwin Chemerinsky\n\nErwin Chemerinsky (born May 14, 1953) is an American legal scholar known for his studies of United States constitutional law and federal civil procedure. He served as the founding dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law from 2008 to 2017, and is currently the dean of the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law.\n\nA study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Chemerinsky to be the second-most frequently cited American legal scholar, behind Cass Sunstein and ahead of Richard Epstein.\n\nRaised in a working-class Jewish family on Chicago's South Side, Chemerinsky attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools for high school. He earned a bachelor's degree in communications from Northwestern University in 1975, where he competed as a debater. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he was a member of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. He graduated from Harvard Law with a Juris Doctor \"cum laude\" in 1978.\n\nChemerinsky taught for over twenty years at the University of Southern California Law School and at DePaul University College of Law before moving to Duke University on July 1, 2004, and then UC Irvine in July 2008. In July 2017, he started a five-year term as dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law.\n\nIn 1995, Chemerinsky was a commentator on the O.J. Simpson trial on KCBS-TV, KNX, and CBS News.\n\nChemerinsky has published six books (three of which have been printed in multiple editions), numerous articles, and a regular column on the United States Supreme Court carried by \"California Lawyer\", the \"Los Angeles Daily Journal\", and \"Trial Magazine\". Chemerinsky has also argued several cases before the United States Supreme Court, including \"United States v. Apel\", \"Scheidler v. NOW\", \"Tory v. Cochran\", \"Van Orden v. Perry\" and \"Lockyer v. Andrade\".\n\nIn March 2011, \"The National Jurist: The Magazine for Law Students\" named Chemerinsky one of the \"23 Law Profs to Take Before You Die\".\n\nOther notable work included:\n\nChemerinsky supports gun control and disagreed with the decision in \"District of Columbia v. Heller\". He thinks that even if an individual's right to bear arms exists, the District of Columbia was justified in restricting that right because it believed that the law would lessen violence. George Will specifically mentioned and responded to Chemerinsky's argument in a column that ran four days later.\n\nChemerinsky believes that \"Roe v. Wade\" was correctly decided. He says, \"Judicial activism is the label for the decision that people don't like.\" He also believes that gay marriage should be legal.\n\nChemerinsky also represents a client held at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. He supports affirmative action. In January 2017, Chemerinsky, along with other high-profile lawyers, sued President Donald Trump for refusing to \"divest from his businesses\".\n\nChemerinsky has defended freedom of speech from the heckler's veto. Following an incident in which nine members of the (UCI) Muslim Students Union disrupted a speech by Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren, Chemerinsky asserted that broad freedom exists to invite speakers and hold demonstrations, but that once a speaker has begun an invited lecture, \"You have the right – if you disagree with me – to go outside and perform your protest. But you don't get the right to come in when I'm talking and shout me down. Otherwise people can always silence a speaker by heckler's veto, and Babel results.\"\n\nAfter the interruptions, Oren completed his remarks and canceled the question-and-answer session. The students were arrested by University of California Irvine Police, which were on hand. However, Chemerinsky also publicly disagreed with the Orange County District Attorney's Office's decision to file criminal charges against the students.\n\nChemerinsky's hiring as dean of the UCI School of Law was controversial. After signing a contract on September 4, 2007, the hire was rescinded by UCI Chancellor Michael V. Drake, who felt the law professor's commentaries were \"polarizing.\" Drake claimed the decision was his own and not the subject of any outside influence.\n\nThe action was criticized by both liberal and conservative scholars, who felt it hindered the academic mission of the law school and violated principles of academic freedom, and few believed Drake's claims that it was not the result of outside influence. The issue was the subject of an editorial in \"The New York Times\" on Friday, September 14. Details emerged revealing that the university had received criticism on the hire from the California Supreme Court's Chief Justice Ronald M. George, who criticized Chemerinsky's grasp of death penalty appeals and a group of prominent local Republicans, including Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D.

The illness is typically characterised by an influenza-like illness and polyarthritis. The virus is endemic to mainland Australia and Tasmania, the island of New Guinea, Fiji, Samoa, the Cook Islands, New Caledonia and several other islands in the South Pacific.\n\nSymptoms of the disease vary widely in severity, but major indicators are arthralgia, arthritis, fever, and rash. The incubation period is 7–9 days. About a third of infections are asymptomatic, particularly in children.\n\nAbout 95% of symptomatic cases report joint pain. This is typically symmetrical and with acute onset, affecting the fingers, toes, ankles, wrists, back, knees and elbows. Fatigue occurs in 90% and fever, myalgia and headache occur in 50–60%.\n\nA rash occurs in 50% of patients and is widespread and maculopapular. Lymphadenopathy occurs commonly; sore throat and coryza less frequently. Diarrhea is rare. About 50% of people report needing time off work with the acute illness. If the rash is unnoticed, these symptoms are quite easily mistaken for more common illnesses like influenza or the common cold. Recovery from the flu symptoms is expected within a month, but, because the virus currently cannot be removed once infection has occurred secondary symptoms of joint and muscle inflammation, pain and stiffness can last for many years.\n\nLess common manifestations include splenomegaly, hematuria and glomerulonephritis. Headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia may occur. There have been three case reports suggesting meningitis or encephalitis.\n\nReports from the 1980s and 1990s suggested RRV infection was associated with arthralgia, fatigue and depression lasting for years. More recent prospective studies have reported a steady improvement in symptoms over the first few months, with 15–66% of patients having ongoing arthralgia at 3 months. Arthralgias have resolved in the majority by 5–7 months. The incidence of chronic fatigue is 12% at 6 months and 9% at 12 months, similar to Epstein–Barr virus and Q fever. The only significant predictor of the likelihood of developing chronic symptoms is the severity of the acute illness itself. No other aspects of the patient's medical or psychiatric history have been found to be predictive. However, in those with the most persisting symptoms (12 months or more), comorbid rheumatologic conditions and/or depression are frequently observed.\n\nThe virus is not contagious and is spread only by mosquitoes. The main reservoir hosts are kangaroos and wallabies, although horses, possums and possibly birds and flying foxes play a role. Over 30 species have been implicated as possible vectors, but the major species for Ross River fever are \"Culex annulirostris\" in inland areas, \"Aedes vigilax\" in northern coastal regions and \"Ae. camptorhynchus\" in southern coastal regions.\n\nA blood test is the only way to confirm a case of Ross River fever. Several types of blood tests may be used to examine antibody levels in the blood. Tests may either look for simply elevated antibodies (which indicate some sort of infection), or specific antibodies to the virus.\n\nThere is currently no vaccine available. The primary method of disease prevention is minimizing mosquito bites, as the disease is only transmitted by mosquitoes. Typical advice includes use of mosquito repellent and mosquito screens, wearing light coloured clothing, and minimising standing water around homes (e.g. removing Bromeliads, plant pots, garden ponds). Staying indoors during dusk/dawn hours when mosquitos are most active may also be effective. Bush camping is a common precipitant of infection so particular care is required.\nAntiviral drugs, that target infections with RRV. Patients are usually managed with simple analgesics, anti-inflammatories, anti-pyretics and rest while the illness runs its course. Pentosan polysulfate has also shown recent promise. \n\nMost notifications are from Queensland, tropical Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Geographical risk factors include areas of higher rainfall and higher maximal tides. In the tropics, Ross River fever is more prevalent during the summer/autumn \"wet season\", particularly January—March, when mosquito populations numbers are high. In southern parts of Australia, this time period may shift to earlier in the year during spring/summer. Areas noted of common place contraction of the virus include townships and along the River Murray areas. Backwaters and Lagoons are breeding grounds for mosquitos and local medical treating facilities report higher cases than cities away from the river around the riverina areas.\n\nAreas near suitable mosquito breeding grounds—marshes, wetlands, waterways and farms with irrigation systems—are high risk areas for outbreaks. As such, the disease is more characteristic of rural and regional areas. Infection is most common in adults aged 25–44 years old, with males and females equally affected. Ross River fever is on the Australian Department of Health and Ageing's list of notifiable diseases.\n\nThe first outbreak of RRF was in 1928 in the Hay and Narrandera region in New South Wales, Australia. The virus was first isolated in 1959 from a mosquito trapped along the Ross River in Townsville, Queensland. Since then, outbreaks have occurred in all Australian states, including Tasmania, and metropolitan areas. The largest outbreak occurred in 1979–1980 in the Western Pacific, and affected more than 60,000 people.\n\nBefore the identification of this infectious agent, the disease was referred to as \"epidemic polyarthritis\". This term was also used for a similar Australian disease caused by another mosquito-borne virus, Barmah Forest virus.\n\nThe study of RRF has been recently facilitated by the development of a mouse model. Mice infected with RRV develop hind-limb arthritis/arthralgia which is similar to human disease. The disease in mice is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate including macrophages which are immunopathogenic and exacerbate disease. Furthermore, mice deficient in the C3 protein do not suffer from severe disease following infection. This indicates that an aberrant innate immune response is responsible for severe disease following RRV infection.\n"}
{"id": "2078911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078911", "title": "Contingency theory", "text": "Contingency theory\n\nA contingency theory is an organizational theory that claims that there is no best way to organize a corporation, to lead a company, or to make decisions. Instead, the optimal course of action is contingent (dependent) upon the internal and external situation. A contingent leader effectively applies their own style of leadership to the right situation.\n\nThe contingency approach to leadership was influenced by two earlier research programs endeavoring to pinpoint effective leadership behavior. During the 1950s, researchers at Ohio State University administered extensive questionnaires measuring a range of possible leader behaviors in various organizational contexts. Although multiple sets of leadership behaviors were originally identified based on these questionnaires, two types of behaviors proved to be especially typical of effective leaders: (1) consideration leader behaviors that include building good rapport and interpersonal relationships and showing support and concern for subordinates and (2) initiating structure leader behaviors that provided structure (e.g., role assignment, planning, scheduling) to ensure task completion and goal attainment.\n\nAbout the same time, investigators from the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center conducted interviews and distributed questionnaires in organizations and collected measures of group productivity to assess effective leadership behaviors. The leadership behavior categories that emerged from the University of Chicago were similar to the consideration and initiating structure behaviors identified by the Ohio State studies. The University of Michigan investigators, however, termed these leadership behaviors \"relation-oriented behavior\" and \"task-oriented behavior\". This line of research was later extended by Robert Blake and Jane Mouton in 1964 to suggest that effective leaders score high on both these behaviors.\n\nThey suggested that previous theories such as Weber's bureaucracy and Taylor's scientific management had failed because they neglected that management style and organizational structure were influenced by various aspects of the environment: the contingency factors. There could not be \"one best way\" for leadership or organization.\n\nHistorically, contingency theory has sought to formulate broad generalizations about the formal structures that are typically associated with or best fit the use of different technologies. The perspective originated with the work of Joan Woodward (1958), who argued that technologies directly determine differences in such organizational attributes as span of control, centralization of authority, and the formalization of rules and procedures.\n\nGareth Morgan in his book \"Images of Organization\" summarized the main ideas underlying contingency:\n\nFred Fiedler's contingency model focused on a contingency model of leadership in organizations. This model contains the relationship between leadership style and the favorable-ness of the situation. Fielder developed a metric to measure a leader's style called the Least Preferred Co-worker. The test consists of 16-22 items they are to rate on a scale of one to eight as they think of a co-worker they had the most difficulty working with. A high score indicates the test taker is relational in style and a low score indicates the test taker is more task orientated in style. Situational favorable-ness was described by Fiedler in terms of three empirically derived dimensions: \n\n\nSituations are favorable to the leader if all three of these dimensions are high. \n\nWilliam Richard Scott describes contingency theory in the following manner: \"The best way to organize depends on the nature of the environment to which the organization must relate\". The work of other researchers including Paul R. Lawrence, Jay Lorsch, and James D. Thompson complements this statement. They are more interested in the impact of contingency factors on organizational structure. Their structural contingency theory was the dominant paradigm of organizational structural theories for most of the 1970s. A major empirical test was furnished by Johannes M Pennings who examined the interaction between environmental uncertainty, organization structure and various aspects of performance. Pennings carried out an empirical study on a sample of retail brokerage offices in which aspects of their market environment such as competitiveness, change and munificence, versus organizational arrangements such as decision making templates, power distribution were juxtaposed for possible implications for performance. While structural attributes of offices strongly impacted performance, the evidence for \"contingency\" was less pronounced.\n\nIt can be concluded that there is ‘no one best way’ or approach in management or doing things, different situation calls for different approach to handle, manage, and solve the arising issue concerned. Management and organization is an ‘Open system’, which embrace anomalies or challenges every now and then, which requires ‘adaptable’ and ‘situational’ solution in order to overcome or solve the problem or issue concerned. Other situational or contingency factors are ‘changes in customer demand for goods and services, change in government policy or law, change in environment or climate change, and so forth.\n\n\n\nson Publishers.\n"}

Together with a group of much smaller islands, it forms Jindo County.\n\nIt is located in South Jeolla province, just off the southwest corner of the Korean peninsula. The island is separated from the mainland by the Myeongnyang Strait; however, this strait is now spanned by South Korea's longest cable-stayed bridge spanning 484 meters. Here in 1597 admiral Yi Sun-sin won the Battle of Myeongnyang, defeating a vastly superior Japanese fleet.\n\nThe Korea Jindo Dog is native to Jindo Island.\n\nEvery year, on a variable day in the spring or summer, a narrow land pass (about 2.9 km long and up to 40 meters wide) opens for about an hour between the main Jindo Island and small Modo island as a result of tidal activity. This event attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists and is accompanied by local festivals.\n\nThe island was known and inhabited since prehistoric time. In 995, it was called Haeyangdo, and later renamed to Okju county and became one of the 14 Korean states. In 1001, the island Okju was changed to Jindo. During the Mongol invasions of Korea of 1231–1270, the island served as a refuge for the Sambyeolcho Rebellion forces. However, in 1271, Mongols captured the island and removed all settlements from there. The population that returned after the Mongol invasion was constantly threatened by Japanese pirates invasions, and thus the island was nearly empty during the 14th century.\n\nOn 16 September 1597, during the Seven Year War, the Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin achieved a decisive victory in the Battle of Myeongnyang held at the Myeongnyang Strait. With 13 panokseons and about 200 men he defeated the Japanese fleet of 133 warships and 200 support ships. During the lifetime of Yi Sun-sin, the strait was also known as 'Uldolmok,' or 'the Roaring Channel,' most likely due to the powerful tidal forces in the channel, which were especially loud in spring.\n\nThe Myeongnyang Strait (Hangul: 명량해협, Hanja: 鳴梁海峽, Revised Romanization: Myeongnyang Haehyeop, McCune–Reischauer: Myŏngnyang Haehyŏp; meaning \"screaming sea\") separates Jindo Island and Jindo County from Haenam County on the mainland. At its narrowest point, the strait is about 300 meters wide and up to 22 meters deep, with the tide variations up to 6 meters in spring. The tidal currents reach up to 6 m/s and are considered as the fastest in Asia. Combined with a whirlpool in the strait, these fast tides hinder navigation. The area is frequently hit by typhoons with typical average wind speeds of 48 m/s. The coastline is very irregular and contains numerous minor valleys, mountains and islets. The shores are steep and are made by eroding igneous and volcanic rocks. There is significant navigation in the strait.\n\nA twin bridge, consisting of two cable-stayed bridges of very similar design, connect Jindo Island with the mainland, and its shape is reflected in the logo of the Jindo County. The first Jindo Bridge was opened on 18 October 1984. It has the main span of 344 m and two side spans of 70 m making the total length of 484 m at a width of only 11.7 m. At the time of its opening, it was the world's longest and narrowest suspension bridge. A 200-meter part under the bridge is open for major navigation for ships with ceiling below 20 meters. Increasing local traffic urged the government to add the second bridge in 2005, which has the same lengths, but is wider at 12.5 meters.\n\nA medium-sized hunting dog breed called the Korean Jindo Dog (Hangul: 진돗개; Hanja: 珍島개) originates from the island. It is known in Korea for its fierce loyalty, attachment to home and hunting abilities. Since 1936, the dog is considered as a national cultural legacy and has been protected during the war times. There is a Jindo Dog Research and Testing Center on the island.\n\nThe tide-related sea level variations result in a land pass 2.9 km long and 10–40 meters wide opening for approximately an hour between the main Jindo island and the small Modo island to the south of Jindo. The event occurs about twice a year, around April–June. It had long been celebrated in a local festival called \"Jindo's Sea Way\", but was largely unknown to the world until 1975, when the French ambassador Pierre Randi described the phenomenon in a French newspaper. Nowadays, nearly half a million foreign and local tourists attend the event annually. It is accompanied by local festivals which include Ganggangsuwollae (Korean traditional circle dance), Ssitkim-gut (a shaman ritual, consoling the souls of the dead), Deul Norae (traditional farmers songs), Manga (burial ceremony songs), Jindo dog show, Buknori (drum performance) and fireworks.\n\nThe island has three art galleries, Sojun, Namjin and Sochi, containing collections of painters who worked here over the past centuries.\n\n\n"}

As a rider, Vasseur competed between 1993 and 2007 for the Novemail–Histor, , , and squads. Vasseur was considered an all-rounder who could do well in a variety of races. He raced in all of the spring classics such as Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix, and won a stage of the Dauphiné Libéré stage race as well as two at the Tour de France.\n\nBorn in Hazebrouck, Nord, Vasseur turned professional with the team Novemail in 1993, and switched to the team in 1995 which then became Crédit Agricole in 1998. His first professional victory is also his most famous: it was his solo 147-kilometre breakaway by which he won stage 5 of the 1997 Tour de France. He then wore the yellow jersey as the race leader for five days.\n\nIn the 2000 and 2001 seasons, he rode for the team and participated in the 2000 Tour de France. However, his exclusion from the 2001 Tour de France team led to his switch to the Cofidis team. He cited personal differences with the USPS team star Lance Armstrong, which was widely quoted in French cycling publications. In the wake of the publication of the USADA memo that proves Lance Armstrong doping practices, he explained that he was excluded because of his refusal to participate in Armstrong's doping program. (\"Inutile de rappeler que je n'ai rien à voir dans cette organisation à qui je dois fort probablement ma non-participation au Tour 2001 ainsi que mon éviction de l'équipe.\")\n\nIn 2004, Vasseur was arrested in suspicion of doping offences along with several other Cofidis riders, notably including then individual time trial champion David Millar. A counter-analysis later proved negative and Vasseur's name was then cleared. Vasseur also claimed some of the evidence in his witness statement had been forged. However, Vasseur was barred from riding in the 2004 Tour de France since the investigation had not concluded by the time that the race had started. He retired at the end of 2007 after taking a second Tour de France stage win that year.\n\nFollowing his retirement from racing, Vasseur served as head of the CPA (the professional cyclists' association), and as a TV pundit. In October 2017 the team announced that Vasseur would return to the team as their new manager.\n\nVasseur came from a family of cyclists: his father Alain Vasseur competed in the 1970, 1971 and 1974 editions of the Tour de France. His father also won a stage of the Tour de France after a solo breakaway.\n\n"}

The station is owned by the Borough of Pompton Lakes and is currently simulcasting WTBQ's full-service format.\n\nOn September 14, 1964, WGHT signed on as WKER, call letters for the founder, Bob Kerr. WKER served as a test market station for radio stations like 77-WABC in the 1960s. The station initially ran a contemporary MOR format that evolved to a full-service adult contemporary format. The station was strictly a daytimer signing on at dawn and signing off at dusk. In early 1993, Bob Kerr's estate sold the radio station to John Silliman, formerly an on-air personality at various other radio stations over the years. Upon taking ownership, Silliman applied for a call sign change to WGHT (which stands for \"Great Hits\"). This application was accepted by the FCC on August 6, 1993.\n\nWGHT broadcast an oldies-classic hits music format playing a deep and wide variety of music from 1952 to about 2000. Recent WGHT personnel included midday air personality as well as general manager Silliman and program director Jimmy Howes. Howes was also WGHT's chief engineer and operations manager. WGHT's News Director was award-winning reporter and newscaster Mike Forte. The station had a cult following in terms of and a professional staff. The station won quite a few awards for their programming. Eventually WGHT had from the FCC a pre-sunrise authorization to sign on at 6:00 a.m. even during the months the sun rose after and a post-sunset authorization for 6:00 p.m. during the months sunset happened earlier. In the last year WGHT would still sign off at 6:00 p.m. even in the summer months when the station could remain on the air as late as 8:30 p.m.\n\nAs with many AM radio stations, selling advertising was becoming difficult. Getting a low-power FM translator was looked into but ultimately rejected by ownership. Also, options such as brokering the station various times of the day were looked at and it was determined that if the station could not be live and local with the programming local people are used to it would be better to just close the station down. In June, it was announced that WGHT would close late in the summer or in the fall. On September 22, 2017, Mariana Broadcasting filed an application with the FCC for consent to transfer ownership of WGHT as part of a donation to the Borough of Pompton Lakes. Pompton Lakes does not plan on operating the station and is looking for a partner to run it. On December 15, 2017, ownership was transferred and the station went silent. Silliman conducted the signoff.\n\nOn December 13, 2018 WGHT began temporarily simulcasting WALL radio, which is based in the Hudson Valley, NY in order to keep its broadcast license valid, a couple of days later WGHT again went silent.\n\nIn March 2019, Frank Truatt, owner of 1110 WTBQ/93.5 W228CG in Warwick, New York, announced plans to begin operating WGHT under a Local Marketing Agreement with the option to purchase the station and its construction permit for 98.3 W252ED.  WGHT will resume broadcasting in April 2019 and will temporarily simulcast programming from WTBQ/W228CG while local programs are being developed. \n\nThe station has been an NAB Marconi Radio Award finalist and an NAB Crystal Radio Award finalist more than a dozen times, and has received Associated Press News Awards.

It was written by Clifford Odets and based on a novel of the same name by Cornell Woolrich (as William Irish). The RKO Pictures film release was the only cinematic collaboration between Clurman and his former Group Theatre associate, screenwriter Odets. The director of photography was RKO regular Nicholas Musuraca. The musical score was by German refugee composer Hanns Eisler.\n\nU.S. Navy sailor Alex Winkley (Bill Williams) wakes up from a night of drinking in New York City and finds he has a wad of cash. His memory is hazy, but he knows he got it from a woman he had visited earlier in the evening, Edna Bartelli (Lola Lane).\n\nWith the help of dance-hall girl June Goffe (Susan Hayward), he attempts to return the money, only to find out that the woman is dead. The sailor is not sure if he is the killer or not. Alex and June, along with a philosophical cabbie (Paul Lukas), stay up all night, attempting to solve the murder mystery before the sailor has to catch a bus to the naval base in Norfolk, Virginia, in the morning. Their deadline is at dawn.\n\nDuring the film, the many false leads and red herrings involve a blind piano player named Sleepy Parsons (Marvin Miller) and a young couple.\n\nBartelli had been blackmailing men with whom she had had affairs, thus many suspects are possible. The woman's brother Val (Joseph Calleia) adds a touch of menace to the plot. The surprise ending resolves all issues, including the relationship between Alex and June.\n\nRichard Fleischer says that Sid Rogell, head of RKO's B Picture unit, bullied Harold Clurman during production meetings, saying he would \"kick the director right in the balls\". He says Clurman accepted it without complaint.\n\nThe dialogue contains Odets' trademark New York wisecracks. For example, while dancing at club early in the movie, the Hayward character likens the dance hall to a post office, filled with second-class matter. Edna Bartelli greets her ex-husband by saying, \"Aren't you dead yet?\"\n\nThere are many \"slice of life\" characterizations of big city people in small roles, such as a tired banana salesman, an angry building superintendent, a refugee with a skin condition who has a crush on June, and a wisecracking sidewalk pitchman.\n\nOdets' Group Theatre colleague Roman Bohnen appears in a bit part, as a grief-stricken man with a dying cat.\n\nFilm critic Dennis Schwartz somewhat liked the film, writing, \"Broadway's Harold Clurman takes his only stab at film directing, after the breakup of his Group Theatre, in this odd psychological thriller noted for its flowery dialogue and muddled story line ... It's penned by playwright Clifford Odets from a story by Cornell Woolrich. Though enjoyable by virtue of its distorted mise-en-scène, affection for NYC characters and its misplaced chatter, this is not art but run-of-the-mill film noir. Set in Manhattan, yet \"Deadline\" used no location shots but was filmed entirely in the studio's back lots. Cinematographer Nick Musuraca does a fine job creating an atmospheric scene of NYC's downtrodden and unhappy souls roaming the dark streets.\"\n\nWarner Bros. released the film on DVD on July 13, 2010, in its \"Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 5\".\n\n"}

The argument starts with the presumption that advertising is less effective than it has been, and that the only way now to gain attention in a market is to not only market a product in a remarkable manner, but also to have a remarkable product to market. Godin gives examples of products and marketing programs that have been remarkable, but indicates that it is no use copying these directly. He says, \"Today, the one sure way to fail is to be boring.

He studied in the Imperial Military Medical Academy under Nikolay Burdenko and served as a military doctor during the World War I; after the October Revolution he was mobilized by the Red Army and continued working at the hospital train.\n\nOlga's mother Maria Timofeevna Berggolts (née Grustilina) (1884—1957) was a native Russian. She also had a younger sister Maria (1912—2003) who would later become an actress of the Leningrad State Theatre of Musical Comedy. With the start of the Russian Civil War in 1918 Fyodor Berggolts sent his family to Uglich where they lived in the former Bogoyavlensky Monastery up until 1921. Upon return Olga entered a Petrograd labor school which she finished in 1926.\n\nHer verses dedicated to Vladimir Lenin were first published in 1924. In 1925 she joined a youth literature group 'The Shift' where she became acquainted with Boris Kornilov. In 1927 Boris and Olga entered the State Institute of Art History, and in 1928 they got married. Same year their daughter Irina was born. Soon the institute was shut down. Some of the students — including Olga, but not Boris — were moved to the Leningrad University.\n\nIn 1930 she graduated from the philological faculty and was sent to Kazakhstan to work as a journalist for the \"Soviet Steppe\" newspaper. During this period Olga divorced Kornilov and married her fellow student Nikolay Molchanov. She also published her first book for children \"Winter-Summer-Parrot\" (1930).\n\nAfter returning to Leningrad in 1931 she started working as a journalist for the newspaper of the electric power plant (\"Electric Power\"). In 1932 she gave birth to her second daughter Maya who died in just a year. Her feelings and thoughts on this period were expressed in such books as \"The Out-of-the-way Place\" (1932), \"Night\" (1935), \"Journalists\" (1934), and \"Grains\" (1935). Such works by Berggolts as \"Poems\" (1934) and \"Uglich\" (1932) were approved of by Maxim Gorky. In 1934 she joined the Union of Soviet Writers.\n\nDuring the late 1930s Berggolts survived several personal tragedies. Her first daughter Irina died in 1936 aged seven, and in 1937 she lost her third child during the full-term pregnancy following the interrogation on the so-called \"Averbakh Case\" (she contacted Leopold Averbakh of the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers at the start of 1930). Soon her former husband Boris Kornilov was arrested \"for taking part in the anti-Soviet Trotskyist organization\" and executed on February 1938.\n\nOn December Olga herself was arrested on the same account and imprisoned. She spent seven months in prison, but denied all accusations. All this caused a birth of her fourth stillborn child. During that time period she wrote poems published as a \"Trial\" anthology during the 1960s. She was subsequently released and completely exonerated in 1939.\n\nIn 1940 she joined the Communist Party. After a long period of silence her novel \"Dream\" and a book of stories \"Vitya Mamanin\" were published to a great acclaim, although she had to hide her prison poetry.\n\nWith the start of the Great Patriotic War on June 1941 Olga Berggolts was sent to work at the Leningrad Radio House. She spent almost every day of the blockade in Leningrad working at the radio, encouraging hungry and depressed citizens of the city by her speeches and poems. Her thoughts and impressions on this period, on problems of heroism, love, faithfulness can be found in \"February Diary\" (1942), \"Leningrad Poem\" (1942), \"Your Way\" (1945), and some others.\n\nOn January 1942 she survived another personal tragedy: her second husband Nikolay Molchanov died of hunger. Olga later dedicated a poem \"29 January 1942\" and her book \"The Knot\" (1965) to Nikolay. On March 1942 Olga, who suffered from a critical form of dystrophy, was forcefully sent by her friends to Moscow using the Road of Life, despite her protests. On 20 April she returned to Leningrad and continued her work at the Radio House. On her return she married Georgy Makogonenko, a literary critic, also a radio host during the siege. In 1943 she was awarded the Medal \"For the Defence of Leningrad\".\n\nTogether with her husband she wrote a screenplay turned a play \"Born in Leningrad\" and a requiem \"In Memory of Defenders\" (1944) on the request of a woman whose brother was killed during the last days of the siege. On January 27, 1945 Berggolts, Makogonenko and their colleagues released a \"radio film\" entitled \"900 days\" that included various fragments of reports, voices, sounds and music pieces recorded during the siege. She also published a book of memoirs \"Leningrad Is Talking\" and a play \"They Lived in Leningrad\" based on her war experience.\n\nBerggolts also wrote many times about heroic and glorious events in the history of Russia, such as \"Pervorossyisk\" (1950), a poem about the Altay commune organized by the workers of Petrograd; \"Faithfulness\" (1954), a tragedy about the defence of Sevastopol in 1941–1942; and \"The Day Stars\" (1959), an autobiographical novel that was turned into a movie of the same name by Igor Talankin in 1968. Olga's voice could be also heard in another Talankin's movie \"Introduction to Life\" (1963) as she reads her poetry.\n\nOn May 9, 1960 Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery was opened dedicated to the victims of the Siege of Leningrad, with the words by Olga Berggolts engraved on the wall behind the Motherland monument. The last line \"No one is forgotten, nothing is forgotten\" became a catchphrase since, often mentioned in Russia during memorial days.\n\nOlga Berggolts died on 13 November 1975, and was buried at Literatorskie Mostki of the Volkovo Cemetery.\n\n\nA minor planet 3093 Bergholz discovered by Soviet astronomer Tamara Mikhaylovna Smirnova in 1971 is named after her. A street in the Nevsky District bears her name, as well as a central street in Uglich. A monument in her memory was opened in Saint Petersburg on May 2015. Also on June the complete collection of diaries by Olga Berggolts was published for the first time by the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art. A crater on Venus is named after her.\n\nAmerican playwright Ivan Fuller wrote a play about Berggolts in 2009 called \"Awake in Me\".\n\n"}

Major advances in the theory were made in the 1940s and 1950s, and led to the introduction of renormalized quantum electrodynamics (QED) developed by Richard Feynman. QED was so successful and accurately predictive that efforts were made to apply the same basic concepts for the other forces of nature. By the late 1970s, these efforts successfully utilized gauge theory in the strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force, producing the modern standard model of particle physics.\n\nEfforts to describe gravity using the same techniques have, to date, failed. The study of quantum field theory is still flourishing, as are applications of its methods to many physical problems. It remains one of the most vital areas of theoretical physics today, providing a common language to several different branches of physics.\n\nQuantum field theory originated in the 1920s from the problem of creating a quantum mechanical theory of the electromagnetic field. In particular, de Broglie in 1924 introduced the idea of a wave description of elementary systems in the following way: \"we proceed in this work from the assumption of the existence of a certain periodic phenomenon of a yet to be determined character, which is to be attributed to each and every isolated energy parcel\".\n\nIn 1925, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan constructed just such a theory by expressing the field's internal degrees of freedom as an infinite set of harmonic oscillators, and by then utilizing the canonical quantization procedure to these oscillators; their paper was published in 1926. This theory assumed that no electric charges or currents were present and today would be called a free field theory.\n\nThe first reasonably complete theory of quantum electrodynamics, which included both the electromagnetic field and electrically charged matter as quantum mechanical objects, was created by Paul Dirac in 1927. This quantum field theory could be used to model important processes such as the emission of a photon by an electron dropping into a quantum state of lower energy, a process in which the \"number of particles changes\"—one atom in the initial state becomes an atom plus a photon in the final state. It is now understood that the ability to describe such processes is one of the most important features of quantum field theory.\n\nThe final crucial step was Enrico Fermi's theory of \"β\"-decay (1934). In it, fermion species nonconservation was shown to follow from second quantization: creation and annihilation of fermions came to the fore and quantum field theory was seen to describe particle decays. (Fermi's breakthrough was somewhat foreshadowed in the abstract studies of Soviet physicists, Viktor Ambartsumian and Dmitri Ivanenko, in particular the Ambarzumian–Ivanenko hypothesis of creation of massive particles (1930). The idea was that not only the quanta of the electromagnetic field, photons, but also other particles might emerge and disappear as a result of their interaction with other particles.)\n\nIt was evident from the beginning that a proper quantum treatment of the electromagnetic field had to somehow incorporate Einstein's relativity theory, which had grown out of the study of classical electromagnetism. This need to put together relativity and quantum mechanics was the second major motivation in the development of quantum field theory. Pascual Jordan and Wolfgang Pauli showed in 1928 that quantum fields could be made to behave in the way predicted by special relativity during coordinate transformations (specifically, they showed that the field commutators were Lorentz invariant). A further boost for quantum field theory came with the discovery of the Dirac equation, which was originally formulated and interpreted as a single-particle equation analogous to the Schrödinger equation, but unlike the Schrödinger equation, the Dirac equation satisfies both the Lorentz invariance, that is, the requirements of special relativity, and the rules of quantum mechanics. \nThe Dirac equation accommodated the spin-1/2 value of the electron and accounted for its magnetic moment as well as giving accurate predictions for the spectra of hydrogen.\n\nThe attempted interpretation of the Dirac equation as a single-particle equation could not be maintained long, however, and finally it was shown that several of its undesirable properties (such as negative-energy states) could be made sense of by reformulating and reinterpreting the Dirac equation as a true field equation, in this case for the quantized \"Dirac field\" or the \"electron field\", with the \"negative-energy solutions\" pointing to the existence of anti-particles. This work was performed first by Dirac himself with the invention of hole theory in 1930 and by Wendell Furry, Robert Oppenheimer, Vladimir Fock, and others. Schrödinger, during the same period that he discovered his famous equation in 1926, also independently found the relativistic generalization of it known as the Klein–Gordon equation but dismissed it since, without spin, it predicted impossible properties for the hydrogen spectrum. (See Oskar Klein and Walter Gordon.) All relativistic wave equations that describe spin-zero particles are said to be of the Klein–Gordon type.\n\nA subtle and careful analysis in 1933 by Niels Bohr and Léon Rosenfeld showed that there is a fundamental limitation on the ability to simultaneously measure the electric and magnetic field strengths that enter into the description of charges in interaction with radiation, imposed by the uncertainty principle, which must apply to all canonically conjugate quantities. This limitation is crucial for the successful formulation and interpretation of a quantum field theory of photons and electrons (quantum electrodynamics), and indeed, any perturbative quantum field theory. The analysis of Bohr and Rosenfeld explains fluctuations in the values of the electromagnetic field that differ from the classically \"allowed\" values distant from the sources of the field.\n\nTheir analysis was crucial to showing that the limitations and physical implications of the uncertainty principle apply to all dynamical systems, whether fields or material particles. Their analysis also convinced most physicists that any notion of returning to a fundamental description of nature based on classical field theory, such as what Einstein aimed at with his numerous and failed attempts at a classical unified field theory, was simply out of the question. \"Fields had to be quantized\".\n\nThe third thread in the development of quantum field theory was the need to handle the statistics of many-particle systems consistently and with ease. In 1927, Pascual Jordan tried to extend the canonical quantization of fields to the many-body wave functions of identical particles using a formalism which is known as statistical transformation theory; this procedure is now sometimes called second quantization. In 1928, Jordan and Eugene Wigner found that the quantum field describing electrons, or other fermions, had to be expanded using anti-commuting creation and annihilation operators due to the Pauli exclusion principle (see Jordan–Wigner transformation). This thread of development was incorporated into many-body theory and strongly influenced condensed matter physics and nuclear physics.\n\nDespite its early successes quantum field theory was plagued by several serious theoretical difficulties. Basic physical quantities, such as the self-energy of the electron, the energy shift of electron states due to the presence of the electromagnetic field, gave infinite, divergent contributions—a nonsensical result—when computed using the perturbative techniques available in the 1930s and most of the 1940s. The electron self-energy problem was already a serious issue in the classical electromagnetic field theory, where the attempt to attribute to the electron a finite size or extent (the classical electron-radius) led immediately to the question of what non-electromagnetic stresses would need to be invoked, which would presumably hold the electron together against the Coulomb repulsion of its finite-sized \"parts\". The situation was dire, and had certain features that reminded many of the \"Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe\". What made the situation in the 1940s so desperate and gloomy, however, was the fact that the correct ingredients (the second-quantized Maxwell–Dirac field equations) for the theoretical description of interacting photons and electrons were well in place, and no major conceptual change was needed analogous to that which was necessitated by a finite and physically sensible account of the radiative behavior of hot objects, as provided by the Planck radiation law.\n\nThis \"divergence problem\" was solved in the case of quantum electrodynamics through the procedure known as renormalization in 1947–49 by Hans Kramers, Hans Bethe, Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, and Shin'ichiro Tomonaga; the procedure was systematized by Freeman Dyson in 1949. Great progress was made after realizing that all infinities in quantum electrodynamics are related to two effects: the self-energy of the electron/positron, and vacuum polarization.\n\nRenormalization requires paying very careful attention to just what is meant by, for example, the very concepts \"charge\" and \"mass\" as they occur in the pure, non-interacting field-equations. The \"vacuum\" is itself polarizable and, hence, populated by virtual particle (on shell and off shell) pairs, and, hence, is a seething and busy dynamical system in its own right. This was a critical step in identifying the source of \"infinities\" and \"divergences\". The \"bare mass\" and the \"bare charge\" of a particle, the values that appear in the free-field equations (non-interacting case), are abstractions that are simply not realized in experiment (in interaction). What we measure, and hence, what we must take account of with our equations, and what the solutions must account for, are the \"renormalized mass\" and the \"renormalized charge\" of a particle. That is to say, the \"shifted\" or \"dressed\" values these quantities must have when due systematic care is taken to include all deviations from their \"bare values\" is dictated by the very nature of quantum fields themselves.\n\nThe first approach that bore fruit is known as the \"interaction representation\" (see the article Interaction picture), a Lorentz-covariant and gauge-invariant generalization of time-dependent perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum mechanics, and developed by Tomonaga and Schwinger, generalizing earlier efforts of Dirac, Fock and Podolsky. Tomonaga and Schwinger invented a relativistically covariant scheme for representing field commutators and field operators intermediate between the two main representations of a quantum system, the Schrödinger and the Heisenberg representations. Within this scheme, field commutators at separated points can be evaluated in terms of \"bare\" field creation and annihilation operators. This allows for keeping track of the time-evolution of both the \"bare\" and \"renormalized\", or perturbed, values of the Hamiltonian and expresses everything in terms of the coupled, gauge invariant \"bare\" field-equations. Schwinger gave the most elegant formulation of this approach. The next and most famous development is due to Richard Feynman, who, with his brilliant rules for assigning a \"graph\"/\"diagram\" to the terms in the scattering matrix (see S-matrix and Feynman diagrams). These directly corresponded (through the Schwinger–Dyson equation) to the measurable physical processes (cross sections, probability amplitudes, decay widths and lifetimes of excited states) one needs to be able to calculate. This revolutionized how quantum field theory calculations are carried-out in practice.\n\nTwo classic text-books from the 1960s, James D. Bjorken, Sidney David Drell, \"Relativistic Quantum Mechanics\" (1964) and J. J. Sakurai, \"Advanced Quantum Mechanics\" (1967), thoroughly developed the Feynman graph expansion techniques using physically intuitive and practical methods following from the correspondence principle, without worrying about the technicalities involved in deriving the Feynman rules from the superstructure of quantum field theory itself. Although both Feynman's heuristic and pictorial style of dealing with the infinities, as well as the formal methods of Tomonaga and Schwinger, worked extremely well, and gave spectacularly accurate answers, the true analytical nature of the question of \"renormalizability\", that is, whether ANY theory formulated as a \"quantum field theory\" would give finite answers, was not worked-out until much later, when the urgency of trying to formulate finite theories for the strong and electro-weak (and gravitational interactions) demanded its solution.\n\nRenormalization in the case of QED was largely fortuitous due to the smallness of the coupling constant, the fact that the coupling has no dimensions involving mass, the so-called fine-structure constant, and also the zero-mass of the gauge boson involved, the photon, rendered the small-distance/high-energy behavior of QED manageable. Also, electromagnetic processes are very \"clean\" in the sense that they are not badly suppressed/damped and/or hidden by the other gauge interactions. By 1965 James D. Bjorken and Sidney David Drell observed: \"Quantum electrodynamics (QED) has achieved a status of peaceful coexistence with its divergences ...\".\n\nThe unification of the electromagnetic force with the weak force encountered initial difficulties due to the lack of accelerator energies high enough to reveal processes beyond the Fermi interaction range. Additionally, a satisfactory theoretical understanding of hadron substructure had to be developed, culminating in the quark model.\n\nThanks to the somewhat brute-force, \"ad hoc\" and heuristic early methods of Feynman, and the abstract methods of Tomonaga and Schwinger, elegantly synthesized by Freeman Dyson, from the period of early renormalization, the modern theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) has established itself. It is still the most accurate physical theory known, the prototype of a successful quantum field theory. Quantum electrodynamics is the most famous example of what is known as an Abelian gauge theory. It relies on the symmetry group \"U\"(1) and has one massless gauge field, the \"U\"(1) gauge symmetry, dictating the form of the interactions involving the electromagnetic field, with the photon being the gauge boson.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s with the work of Yang and Mills, following the previous lead of Weyl and Pauli, deep explorations illuminated the types of symmetries and invariances any field theory must satisfy. QED, and indeed, all field theories, were generalized to a class of quantum field theories known as gauge theories. That symmetries dictate, limit and necessitate the form of interaction between particles is the essence of the \"gauge theory revolution\". Yang and Mills formulated the first explicit example of a non-abelian gauge theory, Yang–Mills theory, with an attempted explanation of the strong interactions in mind. The strong interactions were then (incorrectly) understood in the mid-1950s, to be mediated by the pi-mesons, the particles predicted by Hideki Yukawa in 1935, based on his profound reflections concerning the reciprocal connection between the mass of any force-mediating particle and the range of the force it mediates. This was allowed by the uncertainty principle. In the absence of dynamical information, Murray Gell-Mann pioneered the extraction of physical predictions from sheer non-abelian symmetry considerations, and introduced non-abelian Lie groups to current algebra and so the gauge theories that came to supersede it.\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw the formulation of a gauge theory now known as the Standard Model of particle physics, which systematically describes the elementary particles and the interactions between them. The strong interactions are described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), based on \"color\" \"SU\"(3). The weak interactions require the additional feature of spontaneous symmetry breaking, elucidated by Yoichiro Nambu and the adjunct Higgs mechanism, considered next.\n\nThe electroweak interaction part of the standard model was formulated by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and John Clive Ward in 1959 with their discovery of the SU(2)xU(1) group structure of the theory. In 1967, Steven Weinberg brilliantly invoked the Higgs mechanism for the generation of the W and Z masses (the intermediate vector bosons responsible for the weak interactions and neutral-currents) and keeping the mass of the photon zero. The Goldstone and Higgs idea for generating mass in gauge theories was sparked in the late 1950s and early 1960s when a number of theoreticians (including Yoichiro Nambu, Steven Weinberg, Jeffrey Goldstone, François Englert, Robert Brout, G. S. Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, Tom Kibble and Philip Warren Anderson) noticed a possibly useful analogy to the (spontaneous) breaking of the U(1) symmetry of electromagnetism in the formation of the BCS ground-state of a superconductor. The gauge boson involved in this situation, the photon, behaves as though it has acquired a finite mass.\n\nThere is a further possibility that the physical vacuum (ground-state) does not respect the symmetries implied by the \"unbroken\" electroweak Lagrangian from which one arrives at the field equations (see the article Electroweak interaction for more details). The electroweak theory of Weinberg and Salam was shown to be renormalizable (finite) and hence consistent by Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus Veltman. The Glashow–Weinberg–Salam theory (GWS theory) is a triumph and, in certain applications, gives an accuracy on a par with quantum electrodynamics.\n\nIn the case of the strong interactions, progress concerning their short-distance/high-energy behavior was much slower and more frustrating. For strong interactions with the electro-weak fields, there were difficult issues regarding the strength of coupling, the mass generation of the force carriers as well as their non-linear, self interactions. Although there has been theoretical progress toward a grand unified quantum field theory incorporating the electro-magnetic force, the weak force and the strong force, empirical verification is still pending. Superunification, incorporating the gravitational force, is still very speculative, and is under intensive investigation by many of the best minds in contemporary theoretical physics. Gravitation is a tensor field description of a spin-2 gauge-boson, the \"graviton\", and is further discussed in the articles on general relativity and quantum gravity.\n\nFrom the point of view of the techniques of (four-dimensional) quantum field theory, and as the numerous efforts to formulate a consistent quantum gravity theory attests, gravitational quantization has been the reigning champion for bad behavior.\n\nThere are technical problems underlain by the fact that the gravitational coupling constant has dimensions involving inverse powers of mass, and, as a simple consequence, it is plagued by perturbatively badly behaved non-linear self-interactions. Gravity is itself a source of gravity, analogously to gauge theories (whose couplings, are, by contrast, dimensionless) leading to uncontrollable divergences at increasing orders of perturbation theory.\n\nMoreover, gravity couples to all energy equally strongly, as per the equivalence principle, so this makes the notion of ever really \"switching-off\", \"cutting-off\" or separating, the gravitational interaction from other interactions ambiguous, since, with gravitation, we are dealing with the very structure of space-time itself.\n\nMoreover, it has not been established that a theory of quantum gravity is necessary (see Quantum field theory in curved spacetime).\n\nParallel breakthroughs in the understanding of phase transitions in condensed matter physics led to novel insights based on the renormalization group. They involved the work of Leo Kadanoff (1966) and Kenneth Geddes Wilson & Michael Fisher (1972)—extending the work of Ernst Stueckelberg–André Petermann (1953) and Murray Gell-Mann–Francis Low (1954)—which led to the seminal reformulation of quantum field theory by Kenneth Geddes Wilson in 1975.\n\nThis reformulation provided insights into the evolution of effective field theories with scale, which classified all field theories, renormalizable or not (cf. subsequent section). The remarkable conclusion is that, in general, most observables are \"\"irrelevant\"\", i.e., the macroscopic physics is \"dominated by only a few observables\" in most systems.\n\nDuring the same period, Kadanoff (1969) introduced an operator algebra formalism for the two-dimensional Ising model, a widely studied mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical physics. This development suggested that quantum field theory describes its scaling limit. Later, there developed the idea that a finite number of generating operators could represent all the correlation functions of the Ising model.\n\nThe renormalization group spans a set of ideas and methods to monitor changes of the behavior of the theory with scale, providing a deep physical understanding which sparked what has been called the \"grand synthesis\" of theoretical physics, uniting the quantum field theoretical techniques used in particle physics and condensed matter physics into a single powerful theoretical framework.\n\nThe gauge field theory of the strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics, QCD, relies crucially on this renormalization group for its distinguishing characteristic features, asymptotic freedom and color confinement.\n\n\n\n"}

Common names for \"S. vermiculatus\" include greasewood, seepwood, and saltbush. Traditionally, \"Sarcobatus\" has been treated in the family Chenopodiaceae, but the APG III system of 2009 recognizes it as the sole genus in the family Sarcobataceae.\n\nThe \"Sarcobatus\" plants are deciduous shrubs growing to 0.5–3 m tall with spiny branches and succulent leaves, 10–40 mm long and 1–2 mm broad. The leaves are green, in contrast to the grey-green color of most of the other shrubs within its range. The flowers are unisexual, with the male and female flowers on the same plant and appear from June to August. The species reproduces from seeds and sprouts. \"S. vermiculatus\" was discovered in 1806 by the Lewis and Clark expedition's westward exploration of North America.\n\nThe \"Sarcobatus\" area of distribution is western North America, from southeastern British Columbia and southwest Alberta, Canada south through the drier regions of the United States (east to North Dakota and west Texas, west to central Washington and eastern California) to northern Mexico (Coahuila).\n\nBoth \"Sarcobatus\" species are halophytes, usually found in sunny, flat areas around the margins of playas and in dry stream beds and arroyos. It is replaced by iodine bush in extremely saline environments, such as hummocks within the playa itself. Greasewood often grows in extensive, nearly pure stands in pluvial desert locations and is most common on fine-grained soils in areas with a relatively high water table.\n\nAlthough it can be grazed by animals that are adapted, grazing of greasewood by sheep and cattle can result in oxalate poisoning resulting in kidney failure. The active agent can be either sodium oxalate or potassium oxalate. Sheep are the most vulnerable.\n\nThe wood is yellow, very hard and tough. Because it is so hard, it was used as a shaft for arrows. It was also used as firewood by Native Americans and early settlers. They are used traditionally by Navajo as stirring sticks, Ádístsíín.\n\nThese plants were formerly treated in the family Chenopodiaceae. The family name Sarcobataceae was published in 1997, and is not recognized by the Flora of North America, which however lists it as a \"discordant lineage\" within the larger group of Chenopodiaceae and Amaranthaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (including the APG III system of 2009), does recognize this family. The family comprises the single genus, \"Sarcobatus\", and is placed in the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots. It was suggested that the plastids and the wood anatomy may show an affinity to Phytolaccaceae and Nyctaginaceae rather than to Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae. The sister taxon of \"Sarcobatus\" might be \"Agdestis\".\n\nThe two species are: \n\n"}

The band was founded in Victoria, British Columbia in 1976 by Jim Palosaari and performed to audiences throughout North America, Europe and Australia for over 12 years. Originally named \"Higher Ground\", the group later changed their name to Servant. The lyrics of their songs were known for challenging the Christian Church to turn back to social justice and caring for the poor.\n\nA Servant rock concert was like a festival event. The band was known to incorporate comedy and short skits in their sets on stage. Servant was also the first Christian rock group to use laser lights, flame tubes, fireworks, fog machines, in addition to an extensive light show and quadraphonic sound (a precursor to surround-sound).\n\nIn the early 1980s some critics considered Servant's theatrics, light shows, smoke-bombs and flash-pot stage performances too raucous to be authentically Christian. However, the band's mission was to reach the ears and hearts of those who might not feel so comfortable in church buildings. Shying away from the praise lyrics and easy-listening rock styles that typified most contemporary Christian music at the time, Servant instead attempted to offer edgy, rhythmic, passionate rock and an aggressive stage performance filled with an evangelistic Christian message, and spiced with strong social commentaries.\n\nA \"CCM Magazine\" review of their 1981 release, \"Rockin' Revival\", stated that the band's lyrics reflected Christian communal subculture, and contained elements of social protest and criticism.\n\nServant toured extensively throughout America, Europe and Australia in concert halls and at music festivals like \"Creation\" and \"Greenbelt\". They recorded 6 studio albums with songs that ranked in the Top 40 Contemporary Christian Music Charts including \"Come Jesus Come\", \"Holding on to You\", \"Thank God\", \"We are the Light\", \"Surrender\", \"Harder to Finish\", and \"I Will\".\n\nFrom 1981 to 1985, opening acts for Servant included Grammy Award-winning Petra, DeGarmo & Key, Joe English (of Paul McCartney & Wings fame), Will McFarlane (recorded with Jackson Browne), Randy Matthews, Jerusalem, and Steve Camp. Petra opened for Servant on tour in late 1981 and early 1982 just as Petra's breakthrough album, Never Say Die was being released.\n\nThe band reunited to perform a one-off concert at Cornerstone Festival in July 2011.\n\nIn November 2013, Servant was awarded with the Lifetime Achievement Award from GMA Canada during ceremonies held during the 35th Annual Covenant Awards. On hand to receive the award were band members: Sandie Brock, Owen Brock, Bob Hardy, Rob Martens, Matt Spransy and Eric Odell.\n\nServant has some origins in 1973 from Lonesome Stone, a Christian rock musical touring Europe billed as a multi-media production of the Jesus generation portrayed in music, film and drama to rival the likes of the musical Godspell. Servant's first song to hit the Top 40 CCM charts, \"Come Jesus Come\", was first recorded in 1973 on Lonesome Stone's LP. Lonesome Stone was an outreach of Jesus People Europe, which came out of Jesus People Milwaukee, the latter formed the basis of what eventually became Jesus People USA in Chicago.

He was working in the Gothenburg docks when he joined Nynningen, a rock group with leftist political texts and inspired by the Russian Communist poet Mayakovsky. Totta Näslund became the group's main singer.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Nynningen fused with Nationalteatern, a musical theater ensemble with many members. Totta Näslund joined the group as singer, guitar-player and actor. Nationalteatern developed away from the theater and became a straight rock group, a \"rock orchestra\" as they called themselves. Even though Totta never wrote any own songs for the band, he was probably the most prominent member, next to Ulf Dageby.\n\nNationalteatern was one of the many leftist music and theater groups that came together in 1977 to form Tältprojektet, \"The Tent Project\", a musical theater performance on the history of the Swedish working class, which toured the country that summer. Totta Näslund played \"the Beggar\", the central story telling character of the play, and he sang some of the lead songs, like \"Aldrig mera krig\" (Never War Again) and \"Vi äro tusenden\" (We are legion). Tältprojekted, a non-profit making experiment financed by its members and supporters, was highly successful.\n\nIn the beginning of the 1980s, Nationalteatern dissolved and Totta Näslund directed his full energy to his hobby project, \"Totta's Bluesband\" with lyrics in English and several smaller tours in the U.S..\n\nIn 1995, when Totta turned 50 years old, he decided to go for a solo career and has released 8 solo albums with mostly songs written directly for him by other artists, or covers of other songs.\n\nOne of Totta Näslund's main sources for inspirations was Bob Dylan, and in May 2005 he went to Dylan's hometown Hibbing, Minnesota despite his terminal cancer, where he performed his own interpretation of Bob Dylan songs. Totta had also started making an album together with Mikael Wiehe, with Dylan songs translated to Swedish, but this was interrupted when he suddenly died.\n\nTotta Näslund died on 19 June 2005 of liver cancer. He was scheduled to perform in his hometown Köpmanholmen the next day. He was 60 years old.\n\nWith Nationalteatern\n\nWith Tottas Bluesband\n\nAs a solo artist\n\n\n"}

His music has been released on independent record labels and his catalogue includes work which has found favour amongst DJs and fans from various underground music scenes.\n\nHint's first releases were on the Deep Water label - an imprint based in Leicester in the UK. Shortly after the first promos of his debut EP Beau Selector were circulated amongst DJs, Hint was invited to record a Peel Session at the BBC's Maida Vale Studios, which was broadcast in May 2002.\n\nHint subsequently signed to Bristol-based label Hombre Recordings and began work on his debut album Portakabin Fever. The album was so called because it was written and recorded in a mobile home by James using an Akai MPC, guitar, bass and keyboards. The songs were then mixed with engineer 7-Stu-7 at State of Art - the Bristol-based studio owned by Geoff Barrow of Portishead. Once the album was complete, including cover art and a comic booklet by graphic artist Will Barras, it was released worldwide on 22 April 2003 by Hombre Recordings in association with another, larger independent record label - Ninja Tune.\n\nSeveral of the songs from Portakabin Fever have appeared on television, including uses as incidental music in shows such as Top Gear, C.S.I. Miami and Location, Location, Location and uses in advertising for brands such as Britvic's J2O and Whittaker's Chocolate.\n\nTo support the release of the album, Hint toured Europe as a DJ with Hexstatic and Pest. At 2003's Big Chill music festival Hint was joined on stage by Bonobo on bass and Minotaur Shock on drums, the trio performing under the banner \"The Hint Touring Band\". Both artists also contributed remixes to Hint's track \"Count Your Blessings\".\n\nFrom 2004 until 2008 Hint was also a member of the Futureboogie collective, DJing as a resident at their Seen club nights in Bristol and London and regularly contributing to their internet radio shows.\n\nAfter Hombre Recordings ceased operation, Hint signed to Brighton label Tru Thoughts. Drawing on his love of Drum and Bass, House and Hip Hop, Hint's releases for the label took a more energetic, bass-heavy direction.\n\nThe release in 2008 of Hint's second album Driven From Distraction saw him collaborate for the first time in the studio with vocalists and other musicians, including (on the song \"Muddled Morning\") a 15-year-old MC called Rizzle, who later went on to find success in the group Rizzle Kicks. \"Snake Patrol\" also features a recording of actor Gavin Stenhouse playing guitar.\n\nHint has continued to explore a more dancefloor-focused direction with remixes for label mates Belleruche, Flevans, Hot 8 Brass Band and Maddslinky and released his third album, Daily Intake, in 2012.\n\n\n\n"}
