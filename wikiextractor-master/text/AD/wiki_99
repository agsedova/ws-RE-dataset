William Fincke and his wife Helen, it was formally called The Manumit School for Workers' Children. Its teachings were meant to provide a \"progressive,\" \"workers education\" slant during a time of increasing socialist optimism in America. Sarah Norcliffe Cleghorn worked here as an English and Drama teacher until 1929.\n\nIn 1924, Rev. William Mann Fincke and his wife, Helen Hamlin, founded Manumit as an elementary level, co-educational, boarding school on a working farm in Pawling, New York. It was closely associated with a number of NYC labor unions. A. J. Muste was Chair of Manumit Associates/Board for a number of years.\nIn 1926, Henry R. Linville became interim director upon illness of Rev. Fincke.\n\nIn 1927 Rev. Fincke died.\n\nIn 1927/28 Nellie M. Seeds the wife of Scott Nearing became director.\n\nIn 1933 William Mann Fincke (son of Rev. WMF & Hamlin) became co-director, with wife, Mildred Gignoux. [“By 1933 the school was debt-ridden…and only a half dozen pupils remained...” “Sometimes the children’s welfare seemed subordinated to indoctrination of pet political and social ideas favored by directors or staff members…”\n\nIn 1938/39, the Progressive Schools' Committee for Refugee Children formed under leadership of Mildred and William Fincke. At least 23 Jewish refugee children attended Manumit.\n\nIn 1942, the first two years of high school added to the elementary school.\n\nIn 1943, William I. Stephenson became director. William Fincke attended Yale University to pursue doctorate.\n\nOn October 25, 1943, fire destroyed the major school building, the “Mill”. Most school records weredestroyed.\n\nIn 1944, William M. Fincke resumed directorship with wife, Amelia Evans. The school was moved to Bristol, Bensalem Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1947, Benjamin C.G. Fincke, son of the founders, with wife, Magdalene (“Magda”) Joslyn, became co-director.\n\nIn 1949, the final two years of high school were added.\n\nIn 1950, the school adopted the “work project” experiment.\n\nThe first full high school graduation took place in 1951. From 1950-57, there were between 43 and 52 graduates: of 42 on a list, 29 attended colleges, 3 art schools, 1 technical school.\n\nIn 1954 Benjamin Fincke resigned. John A. Lindlof, student at Pawling and teacher at Bristol, became Co-Director.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, “Negro children had reached 14%;” children of Asian descent had reached 8%.\n\nIn 1956, overt external attacks on school began, including fire hazard inspections: “Local political manipulations are suspected because housing projects have recently surrounded the school and certain residents may object to the interracial status of the school, or local promoters may see the value of the school property.…”\n\nIn 1957/58, the school was closed following denial of license renewal for 1958 by the State Board of Private Academic Schools, Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction. Subsequently, school records were destroyed. The Board inspector ”has singled this school out for complaint over a long period of time, and there is every reason to believe that she is prejudiced against an integrated school, and against its director….” \n\nWilliam Mann Fincke died on January 4, 1968, in Stonington, Connecticut. He had been teaching remedial reading in the area since 1963.\n\n\n\n"}

It was developed by a CompuServe executive, Alexander \"Sandy\" Trevor, and released by CompuServe on February 21, 1980, as the first public, commercial multi-user chat program.\n\nAt that time, most people were familiar with citizens band radio, often abbreviated as CB radio, but multi-user chat and instant messaging were largely unknown. CompuServe CB used the CB radio paradigm to help users understand the new concept. Like CB radio it had 40 \"channels\" and commands like \"tune\", \"squelch\", and \"monitor\". CompuServe CB quickly became the largest single product on CompuServe despite virtually no marketing. When 40 channels was not enough, additional \"bands\" were added, such as the \"Adult\" band. \n\nThe first online wedding occurred on CompuServe CB, and worldwide fans organized events to meet in the \"real world\" people they had met in CB. Compuserve's CBIG (CB Interest Group) Sysop Chris Dunn (ChrisDos) met his wife Pamela (Zebra3) there in the early 1980s, eventually being featured on the Phil Donahue Show. Later, enhancements to CompuServe CB were made to enable multiplayer games, digital pictures, multimedia, and large conferences. For example, Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones held the first online multimedia conference using CompuServe CB from London on December 7, 1995.\n\nOne of the first online weddings occurred between *MilesTeg* and *Cinderella* on May 4, 1991. While the couple said their vows at the Silver Bells Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, *TennesseeBunny* was dialed in with a laptop computer and a 2,400-bit-per-second modem and broadcast the event play by play. Later the couple celebrated at the \"reception\" during the Vegas CB Bash at the Palace Station Hotel. The wedding was attended by 20+ CB regulars in person and over 50 virtual guests online. The couple were still married as of 2019.\n\nThe CompuServe CB Simulator was also the setting for \"The Strange Case of the Electronic Lover\", an ethnographic study by Lindsy Van Gelder examining the phenomenon of gender-bending identity in the early days of online chatrooms, and how one user's exposure as a man pretending to be female influenced a user community.\n\nIn October 1983 CBSIM CB Simulator was written and released by Jerry Thomas Hunter as the first publicly accessible CB Simulator software available for privately operated computer bulletin board systems (BBSs). The program was released as \"freeware\" as an add-on module (or \"Door\") for the popular RBBS-PC. It enabled users connected on one node of a bulletin board system to \"chat\" with users dialed in on other nodes. Initially, CBSIM supported a maximum of 32 concurrent nodes (connected users), and allowed dynamic creation and cataloging of \"channels\" by the users of the BBS on which it was installed. The source code was released to the public from the inception of the CBSIM project, and this source code quickly became the foundation for multi-node chat systems embedded in other popular BBS software products.\n\nIn the middle '80s, a version of CB was written for the DEC RSTS/E operating system. It was accomplished by using a rare shared R/W Runtime system, to keep track of users in the CB simulator. This was one of the first and only usage of a shared memory area, mapped to Basic-Plus virtual arrays, to keep track of a program usage. Using CB, you could communicate to other users across DECNET to other nodes of the system. Built in was also a pseudo-tty module, which allowed you to execute programs, while 'chatting' in CB on the same terminal. The software was made available though DECUS SIG RSTS users group.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2317193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317193", "title": "Ego-state therapy", "text": "Ego-state therapy\n\nEgo-state therapy is a parts-based psychodynamic approach to treat various behavioural and cognitive problems within a person. It uses techniques that are common in group and family therapy, but with an individual patient, to resolve conflicts that manifest in a \"family of self\" within a single individual. \n\nThe concept of segmentation of personality has been around for many years, and that of ego states was highlighted by the psychoanalyst Paul Federn. The creation of ego-state therapy is attributed to John G. Watkins, an analysand of Edoardo Weiss who was himself analysed by Federn.\n\nDistinct ego states—in the most rigorous sense—do not normally develop except in cases of dissociative identity disorder. However, ego state therapy identifies and names facets of a patient's personality, e.g., the \"frightened child\" or \"control freak\". After the characteristics and function of each ego state are identified, the therapist uses various psychotherapeutic techniques (e.g. behavioral, cognitive, analytic, or humanistic therapies) to achieve a kind of integration or internal diplomacy. Ego state therapy may use hypnosis, but is not necessarily required to do so, employing conversational technique instead. Ego state therapy has sometimes been able to resolve complex psychodynamic problems relatively quickly.\n\nIn the development of the human personality, there are two processes that are essential: integration and differentiation. Through integration a person learns to put concepts together, like a shirt and a pair of trousers, to build more complex units known as clothes. By differentiation the person separates general concepts into specific meaning, such as the differences between a comfortable shirt and an uncomfortable shirt. Such differentiation allows humans to experience one set of behaviours in a different situation to another.\n\nPsychological processes do not exist on an either/or basis. Things such as moods and emotions like depression, anxiety, and fear exist on a continuum with differing degrees of intensity. It is the same with differentiation-dissociation. Disorders such as multiple personality disorder are often in the extreme end of the continuum that begins with normal differentiation. It is a matter of intensity. Therefore, the general principle of personality formation in which the process of separation has resulted in discrete segments, called ego states, with boundaries that are more or less permeable. Where however an ego state is a response to psychological trauma, it may remain completely walled-off from the rest of the personality.\n\nEgo states exist as a collection of perceptions, cognitions and affects in organised clusters. An ego state may be defined as an organized system of behavior and experience, whose elements are bound together by common principle. When one of these states is invested with ego energy, it becomes \"the self\" in the here and now. This state is executive, and experiences the other states which are then invested with object energy.\n\nEgo states vary in their volume. A large ego state may include all the various behaviors activated in one's occupation. A small ego state are the behaviours one experiences in a simple action, such as using a mobile phone. They may represent current modes of behavior and experiences or, as with hypnotic age regression, include many memories, postures, feelings, etc. that were apparently learned at an earlier age. They may be organised into different dimensions. For example, an ego state may be built around the age of 10. Another one may represent patterns of behavior toward a father or authority figures and thus overlap with experiences from the age of 10. Behaviors to accomplish a similar goal may be uniquely different from one ego state to another, especially in true multiple personalities.\n\nHypnosis is a process to assist focus and dissociation. Through hypnosis, the therapist can focus on a single ego state or segment of personality and dissociate other parts. Many practitioners today are hypnotically activating covert ego states and announcing that they have discovered another multiple personality. Although multiple personalities are usually studied through hypnosis, they should be diagnosed only when the ego states can become overt spontaneously and when the main personality is generally amnesic to what occurs when the alter is overt and executive. When a covert ego state can be induced to emerge only through hypnosis, we do not consider this as a true multiple personality, and it should not be diagnosed. Ego states are commonly found through student volunteers for hypnotic studies. Because hypnosis is a form of dissociation, it is not surprising to find that good hypnotic subjects often manifest covert ego states in their personalities without being mentally ill.\n"}

A secondary coastal facility, Duke University Marine Laboratory, is maintained in Beaufort, North Carolina. The Nicholas School is composed of three research divisions: Earth and Ocean Sciences, Environmental Sciences and Policy, and Marine Science and Conservation. The current dean of the Nicholas School is Toddi Steelman.\n\nThe Nicholas School celebrates its creation date as 1991, but it represents a coming together of three entities that are almost as old as the university itself. Both formed in 1938, the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and the Duke University Marine Laboratory came together in 1991 to become the School of Environment. Following a $20 million gift from Peter M. and Ginny Nicholas in 1995, the school was named the Nicholas School of the Environment. In 1997, the Department of Geology (formed in 1936) joined the school as the Division of Earth and Ocean Sciences and focuses on a number of areas at the intersection of earth and environmental sciences.\n\nThe school is headquartered in Grainger Hall, a 70,000-square-foot, five-story glass-and-concrete building, located on Circuit Drive on Duke’s West Campus that incorporates green features and technologies inside and out. It has been designed to meet or exceed the criteria for LEED Green Building platinum certification, the highest level of sustainability. Duke University’s Grainger Hall Received LEED Platinum Certification on October 26, 2015.\n\nThe hall houses five classrooms, a 105-seat auditorium, 45 private offices, 72 open office spaces, a 32-seat computer lab, an outdoor courtyard and an environmental art gallery, as well as conference rooms, shared workrooms and common.\n\nGreen features range from rooftop solar panels and innovative climate control and water systems, to special windows that moderate light and heat, to an organic orchard and sustainably designed landscaping.\nThe building sits in front of the A Wing of Levine Science Research Center (LSRC) its former home. That wing of the LSRC is currently undergoing renovations to house laboratories and student services oriented offices. The Division of Earth and Ocean Sciences occupies renovated laboratories in the Old Chemistry building on the West Campus with plans to relocate to new space in LSRC and Grainger Hall sometime in 2019. The division maintains facilities for geochemical analysis and climate modeling studies.\n\nThe School also holds classes in the Old Chemistry building as well as in the Gross Chemistry Energy Hub on Duke’s main campus.\n\nThe Duke University Marine Laboratory is home to the third division of the school, the Marine Science and Conservation division situated on Pivers Island in Beaufort, North Carolina. The current Director of the Marine Laboratory is Andrew J Read. In addition, the Nicholas School uses the Duke Forest, established in 1931 and spanning 7,060 acres, for teaching and research purposes.\n\nAs of 2018, the Nicholas School provides educational opportunities for students at the doctoral level (Ph.D.), graduate professional level (Master of Environmental Management and Master of Forestry), and undergraduate level (B.S. and A.B.).\n\nDoctoral Programs: Earth and Ocean Science, Environment, Marine Science & Conservation, University Program in Ecology, University Program in Environmental Health and Toxicology, University Program in Environmental Policy\n\nMaster's Programs: Master of Environmental Management, Master of Forestry, Master of Environmental Policy\n\nMaster's Programs: international Master of Environmental Policy at Duke Kunshan University\n\nUndergraduate Programs:Earth& Ocean Sciences, Environmental Sciences | Environmental Sciences& Policy Programs, Marine Science&Conservation\n\nJoint degree programs with Duke University School of Law, Fuqua School of Business, and Sanford School of Public Policy are also available to enrolled students at the Nicholas School.

Pune Metropolitan Transport Corporation\"), is the public transport bus service provider for the city of Pune (PMC & PCMC Limits). Prior to its foundation on 19 October 2007, the twin cities were served by two separate providers, viz. the Pune Municipal Transport (PMT) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Transport (PCMT). It operates 371 routes within a radius of 20 km around the two cities, including 51 Rainbow BRT routes that at least partially ply on the 4 bus rapid transit corridors.\n\nNow in 2019 PmpmL has introduced Electric AC Buses in Normal fare which is consist of 9 mtr as well as 12 mtr \n\nPune Nagarpalika, predecessor of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), conceived the idea of a public transport system for the city in the 1940s which materialized when the Regional Transport Office gave its nod for M/s. Silver Jubilee Motors to take up the charge. The service that began with 4 routes with 20 buses already had increased to 46 buses by 1948.\n\nAfter the transformation of Pune Nagarpalika into PMC in 1950, the civic body took over the service. Pune Municipal Transport (PMT), as it was named after the takeover, started with a fleet of 57 buses that plied on 14 routes.\n\nThe public transport provider for the industrial city, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Transport (PCMT), was founded on 4 March 1974 with a fleet of 8 buses plying between Pimpri and Bhosari. PCMT saw rapid expansion and already by 1988, it had a fleet of 101 buses plying on 13 routes.\n\nA proposal for merger of PMT and PCMT into a unified company to serve the larger metropolitan regions was proposed as early as 1992, when the general body of the PMC passed a resolution supporting such merger. However, the PCMC only considered a merger in 2003. The merger was formally announced in April 2007 and PMPML as it exists today came into being on 19 October 2007.\n\nPer the website in April 2018, PMPML has a fleet of 1450 buses maintained at 13 depots. However due to several buses being in disrepair, only 1277 buses are operational and ferry c. 900,000 passengers every day.\n\nPMPML acquired 50 electric buses in August 2019, taking the total fleet tally to 75. The first lot of 25 electric buses in February 2019. PMPML also plans to acquire 350 of such electric buses by the end of 2019.\n\nPMPML operates regular scheduled services daily between 5:30 am and midnight on 371 routes. The frequencies on individual routes vary greatly according to demand. Certain long distance routes are serviced only a few times per day. Some of these routes are partially or fully run on the BRT corridors under the brand name Rainbow BRTS. \nPMPML also operates night buses after midnight on 7 routes. On the occasion of International Women's Day 2018, PMPML launched 'Tejaswini' (Marathi: तेजस्विनी; radiant) bus services exclusively for women which were well received by women commuters. There 218 daily Tejaswini services during the morning and afternoon peak hours on eight of the busiest routes. PMPML also runs special services for tourists under the name 'Pune Darshan' as well as airport services from Rajiv Gandhi IT Park, Hinjewadi to Pune Airport.\n\nSingle journey tickets are valid for a single trip between any two points. They are issued as paper tickets and are to be bought on board from the conductor. The fare depends on the distance of travel (see table below) and needs to be paid in cash. Children between the ages of three and twelve years travel at reduced fares, called 'half ticket', while no fares are charged for children younger than three. Fares on the night bus services are higher.\n\nPMPML offers daily, weekly, fortnightly, quarterly and annual traveling passes to make journeys convenient for its passengers. Discounted passes are also there for elderly passengers, visually and physically challenged, reporters and freedom fighters. All passes can be obtained both online and offline. A pass can only be used in conjunction with an identity card issued by the PMPML at a cost of ₹ 20 (+ ₹ 5 for application). As of April 2018, a monthly pass valid for a month on all routes costs ₹ 1,400, while students and senior citizens need to pay ₹ 750 and ₹ 500, respectively. A day pass valid on all routes costs ₹ 70 and can only be obtained on board.\n\nPMPML currently has 11 operational bus depots.\n\nPMPML has been incurring heavy operational losses ever since its formation in 2007. As per the merger contract, the PMC and PCMC bear 60% and 40% of the losses respectively. There have been disputes between the two civic bodies resulting in demands for dissolving the PMPML to form PMT and PCMT as they existed before 2007.\n\nPMPML is the sole public transport provider for the metropolitan area surrounding the twin cities of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad with a population of 5,057,709. PMPML had a fleet of 1780 buses of which on an average only 1,382 were operational. Thus at any given moment, c. 34% of its fleet was off roads, way above the limit of 20% per the norms set by the Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT). This put the ratio of operational buses at c. 27 per 100,000 population. Reasons for these buses being off roads are mainly related to maintenance and frequent breakdowns due to several factors including insufficient manpower and facilities at PMPML depots and lack of preventive maintenance. PMPML also has a number of buses that are owned and maintained by private contractors which also suffer poor maintenance. Moreover, a significant number of buses in the fleet are older than 15 years while 746 buses are 10-15 years old making them prone to frequent breakdowns. Insufficient buses inevitably lead to overcrowding on the buses during peak hours with as many as three times the capacity riding a single bus.\n\nTo alleviate the problem of insufficient buses, PMPML had decided to buy 800 new diesel buses in 2017 postponing its initial plan of buying 550 air conditioned buses. The decision drew severe criticism regarding the environmental impact of diesel buses. Several NGOs and commuter groups suggested that PMPML should buy CNG buses instead. As a result, it was decided that 400 CNG and 400 diesel-run buses would be bought. However, CM Devendra Fadnavis insisted that PMPML concentrates on eco-friendly buses in April 2018. As of May 2018, PMPML planned to buy 500 electric air conditioned buses and 400 CNG buses.\n\nPMPML does not have sufficient bus depots which leads to as many as half of the buses being parked on the streets in 2015. The drivers have also been blamed for parking haphazardly leading to traffic snarls in the busy areas of the city. According to a CIRT report, PMPML needs 18 depots as opposed to 13 in 2016-17. Recently, the development of new depots to solve the parking issue has gained some momentum. Bus shelters have been criticized for their condition, lack of seats, information, etc.\n\nIn 2017-18, several buses caught fire which has put a big question mark on the safety of commuters. Between January 2017 and March 2018, a period of 15 months, the number of such incidents had reached 16 with almost one incident per month. In an answer to a query submitted under the Right to Information Act, it was revealed that PMPML owns only 124 fire extinguishers and most buses have neither undergone a fire safety audit nor do they have any fire extinguishers. PMPML have claimed that fire extinguishers on the buses are prone to theft. PMPML announced that all of its buses and facilities will undergo a fire safety audit and would be equipped with fire extinguishers by end of May 2018.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2317222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317222", "title": "Tohickon Creek", "text": "Tohickon Creek\n\nTohickon Creek is a tributary of the Delaware River. Located entirely in Bucks County, in southeastern Pennsylvania, it rises in Springfield Township and has its confluence with the Delaware at Point Pleasant. It is dammed to form Lake Nockamixon.\n\nPrior to European settlement, the area through which the creek runs was inhabited by the Lenape tribe. The area was called\n\"Tachan Hoking\" (pronounced Toc-ahn Hok Ing) or “Piece of Wood Area Place.” It could also mean \"Achtuhhu Ing\" (pronounced \"Awk-too-who Ing\") or \"Deers Place.\" Early white settlers in the area noted the fast, constant current of the creek, and by the late eighteenth century a number of water-powered mills had sprung up along the lower portion of the Tohickon valley. Notable among these was the grist mill of Ralph Stover, in Plumstead Township. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, long after the mill had been shut down, the Stover heirs gave the area around the mill to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. After the Federal Works Progress Administration converted the area for recreational use, a Ralph Stover State Park was opened to the public in 1935.\nThe creation of Ralph Stover State Park was the beginning of the Tohickon Creek's shift from an industrial area to a recreational area. The next move in this direction came in 1958, when the United States Army Corps of Engineers dammed the creek just south of Quakertown, forming Tohickon Lake, another state park. It was later renamed Lake Nockamixon, another Lenape name meaning \"place of soft soil.\"\n\nMore and more land along the creek was eventually turned into parkland. The next addition to the park was the High Rocks unit of Ralph Stover State Park, donated to the Commonwealth by the late James Michener, a famous local author. It features vertical rock cliffs above the creek. Today another park, Tohickon Valley County Park, borders High Rocks on three sides and their trail systems interlace. Together they protect the steep valley that Tohickon Creek cuts through the hills south of the old grist mill.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America also have a camp located along the creek, Camp Ockanickon, and a few private campgrounds are located along its course.\n\nThe Tohickon Creek is long, located entirely within Bucks County, is part of the Delaware River watershed, and drains of . The GNIS I.D. Number is 1189623, the U.S. Department of the Interior stream code is 03110. It meets its confluence at the Delaware's 157.0 river mile.\n\nTohickon Creek is the longest waterway located entirely in Bucks County. Its tortuous course begins in the far north of the county, then generally winds east to the Delaware River. For the purpose of this article, its course can be divided into three main segments: the western half, Lake Nockamixon, and the eastern half.\n\nTohickon Creek begins its journey to the Delaware as a small, nondescript stream in Springfield Township on the slopes of The Lookout. From its source, it heads generally south, straight into Richland Township then Quakertown, the largest settlement along its entire course. It then takes a sharp turn east and for a while forms the boundary between Haycock and East Rockhill Townships. It takes one more turn south before heading into Lake Nockamixon.\n\nAlong this part of its route, the creek starts off small. Unlike the rest of its course, the ground is relatively flat and rock-free, giving it a slow current and somewhat muddy appearance. Because of the flatness of the area, Tohickon Creek's watershed along its western section is significantly larger than downstream. By the time the creek flows into Lake Nockamixon, it has already met about half of its tributaries.\n\nAs far as recreation goes, Camp Tohikanee and scenic Sheards Mill and Sheard's Mill Covered Bridge are located along this first part of the creek's route.\nAlmost exactly halfway through its route, the creek forms and runs through Lake Nockamixon. This is the only section of the course of significant distance where it flows northeast. It is about from where the stream becomes the lake and the dam where it becomes Tohickon Creek again. Along this distance it forms the boundary between Haycock and Bedminster Townships.\n\nAs the stream widens into the vast Lake Nockamixon, the current becomes almost undetectable. However, the deep water is by no means stagnant, and tends to stay clean and blue. For the first time along its course, the creek also supports a wide variety of fish, including walleye, pickerel, carp, and various kinds of bass and catfish.\n\nThis entire part of the route is contained in Nockamixon State Park. As far as recreation goes, boating and fishing are allowed in the lake water, and visitors may stay at park managed campgrounds along the southern shore of the lake or a nearby youth hostel.\nUpon leaving Lake Nockamixon, Tohickon Creek becomes very different from the slow, tiny creek farther west. After leaving the lake it heads southeast, forming the boundary between Bedminster and Tinicum townships. It then begins heading in a generally eastern direction, though it constantly twists and curves for the rest of its route. Here it becomes the boundary between Tinicum and Plumstead townships, and flows through Ralph Stover State Park. At its very end it flows straight through the middle of the village of Point Pleasant and under the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal, then finally joins the Delaware River to be carried the rest of the way to the sea.\n\nThe ground along this part is very rocky and the creek quickly loses elevation, creating a clear, fast current. It is also along this part of its course that the creek dramatically cuts a valley into the steep hills along its sides. At the area popularly known as High Rocks, vertical walls of stone up to 200 ft (61 m) high rise above the northern edge of the creek. However, as the creek enters Point Pleasant, the ground evens out a bit and the creek becomes relatively more tranquil before entering the river.\n\nAlong this lower route of the creek, the rapids of the creek often produce whitewater when high-water conditions exist. At the very end of the creek, the village of Point Pleasant has developed into somewhat of a tourist destination, and visitors can see a number of scenic old bridges that cross the creek before it runs into the Delaware.\n\nThe Tohickon risees in Springfield Township on a layer of diabase which intruded into the Gettysburg and Newark basin during the Jurassic and Triassic. The diabase is typically dark gray to black, dense, and fine grained, consisting of predominately labradorite and augite.\n\nIt then flows through the Brunswick Formation laid down earlier, consisting of shale, mudstone, and siltstone. Mineralogy includes argillite and hornfels.\n\nAfter passing through another extension of diabase, it continues its journey through alternating bands of the Brusnwick Formation and the Lockatong Formation until it reaches the Delaware. The Lockatong was laid down during the Triassic, consisting of dark argillite, shale, and some impure limestone and calcareous shale.\n\nSince the 1930s, Tohickon Creek has established itself as one of the best recreational waterways in southeastern Pennsylvania. Along its course, it flows through three state parks: Nockamixon, Ralph Stover, and Delaware Canal. The eastern two thirds of its course are the most heavily used, and it presents many varied opportunities for any visitor.\n\nLake Nockamixon is the most visited spot along the creek's course. Boating is the most popular activity, and its main marina holds dozens of sail boats, and rents out smaller boats to visitors, too. Fishing is also a popular activity, and a fishing pier has been set up of the shore of the lake. Visitors can also hike or bike ride around the area, hunt in certain areas, and even camp if planning to stay for more than one day. When high-water conditions exist, normally in early March and late November, the dam at Lake Nockamixon releases surges of water for one day every few months. This turns Tohickon Creek into a whitewater course, and boaters can manage their ways the entire route from the lake to the Delaware River.\nAt the High Rocks unit of Ralph Stover State Park, visitors can rock climb up cliffs or look at the view from atop. A pathway, Ridge Trail, travels along the top of the wide valley from High Rocks and goes south into Tohickon Valley County Park towards Point Pleasant. At its very end, the creek passes beneath Delaware Canal State Park, where prior to the floods of 2004–2005 visitors could walk north all the way to Easton or south all the way to Bristol. The debris caught in the bridge in the adjacent picture is from this same flood that destroyed entire parts of the canal. Reconstruction of the park is currently underway.\n\n\n"}

Local station WDRQ took notice of his talent and offered him a spot as a temporary late-night weekend disc jockey for a country music station. After high school, he successfully turned his temporary trial into a permanent multi-year gig at KDAY in Los Angeles, California. Soon after, in April 1979 he started at KMJM-Majic 108, as \"The Unknown DJ\"\n\nBanks then moved on to the LA station KFI, which helped to pave the way to a morning show slot in Las Vegas at KLAV. Doug's next two stops were KDIA in Oakland, California, and WBMX (now WVAZ) in Chicago, Illinois. From 1986 to 1995, Banks did nights, mornings, and afternoons for WGCI-FM in Chicago.\n\nNext, the ABC Radio Network offered Banks the opportunity to do a nationally syndicated show. Originally, Banks started with an afternoon show from the same studio as the \"Tom Joyner Morning Show.\" In 1997, Banks wanted to move to a morning show instead and the studio across the hall from Joyner's was made ready. The new show, hosted by Banks along with new sidekick DeDe McGuire, rose to become one of the top-rated syndicated urban programs in America. In January 2008, the show was cancelled, but Banks relaunched the show, this time in the afternoon drive under the new name, \"The Ride with Doug and DeDe\".\n\nUnlike his previous show where Mainstream Urban/Hip Hop/R&B music was played, Banks's new program was aimed at the Urban Adult Contemporary audience, similar to what is played on Joyner's and Steve Harvey's shows. In July 2010, Banks moved his show to American Urban Radio Networks and renamed it \"The Doug Banks Show\".\n\nBanks also hosted some editions of \"NASCAR Now\" on ESPN2. He also made a guest appearance on the sitcom \"My Wife and Kids\" as Tom Miller, a friend of Michael Kyle who is tragically killed after being hit by a taxi (offscreen), shortly after he and Michael were together. The death of Tom makes Michael paranoid and overly sensitive about his own life.\n\nBanks died from complications of diabetes and kidney failure on April 11, 2016.

{"id": "2317280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317280", "title": "Jean Brooks", "text": "Jean Brooks\n\nJean Brooks (born Ruby Matilda Kelly; December 23, 1915November 25, 1963) was an American film actress and singer who appeared in over thirty films. Though she never achieved major stardom in Hollywood, she had several prominent roles in the early 1940s as a contract player for RKO Radio Pictures.\n\nBorn in Houston, Brooks spent her early life in Texas and Costa Rica. She began her career as a club singer and guitarist in New York City before being cast in several minor walk-on parts in films. She would later appear in supporting roles in the Universal Pictures serial productions \"Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe\" (1940) and \"The Green Hornet Strikes Again!\" (1941). In 1942, Brooks signed a contract with RKO and appeared in multiple films by the studio, including Jacques Tourneur's \"The Leopard Man\" (1943), Mark Robson's horror noir \"The Seventh Victim\" (1943), and drama \"Youth Runs Wild\" (1944), as well as several films in the Falcon series.\n\nHer later life and career were marred by struggles with alcoholism, and a series of drunken public appearances resulted in Brooks ending her contract with RKO. In 1948, she made her final film appearance in \"Women in the Night\" (1948) before abandoning her career as an actress and relocating to San Francisco, California. She died in 1963 of complications resulting from her alcoholism.\n\nBrooks was born Ruby Matilda Kelly on December 23, 1915 in Houston, Texas, the fourth child of Horace and Robina Kelly. Through her mother, Brooks was of English and Canadian descent. Her two older brothers, Horace Jr. and Ernest, were both teenagers at the time she was born; a third son had died in 1912 at age seven of tetanus.\n\nBrooks spent her early years in Texas but after her father's death during her childhood, she and her mother relocated to Costa Rica, her mother's native country. There, they lived on Brooks' grandfather's coffee plantation. As a result, Brooks was binlingual, fluent in both English and Spanish. During her teenage years, Brooks relocated with her mother to New York City, with plans to attend college.\n\nBrooks began her professional career as a singer at New York City's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where she sang and performed as a guitarist in Enric Madriguera's orchestra. She adopted the name Jeanne Kelly for her entertainment career, so as not to be confused with actress Ruby Keeler. With the help of Erich von Stroheim, whom Brooks had met while working at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, she began her acting career. Her first screen role was in the Arcturus Pictures release \"Obeah!\" (1935), a film about Obeah curses.\n\nAfter having bit parts in \"Frankie and Johnnie\" and \"Tango-Bar\" (both 1935), she starred alongside von Stroheim in \"The Crime of Dr. Crespi\" (1935). Brooks parted ways with von Stroheim some time after \"Crespi\". She then acted in the stage melodrama \"Name Your Poison\", opposite Lenore Ulric, which premiered at the Sam S. Shubert Theatre in Newark, New Jersey on January 20, 1936.\n\nIn 1938, Brooks attempted to get back into film acting. After a failed screen test with 20th Century Fox, and the collapse of Major Productions (who had signed Brooks three weeks before going out of business), she signed a contract to star in Spanish-language films for Paramount Pictures. She landed two starring roles with Paramount, acting under the stage name Robina Duarte; her fluency in Spanish allowed her to effectively play the parts.\n\nAfter the Paramount contract was completed, Brooks spent another year taking bit parts. In 1940, she signed a contract with Universal Studios, playing bit parts and minor roles in features (she is seen briefly in Abbott and Costello's \"Buck Privates\") and serials (again briefly, in \"Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe\" and \"The Green Hornet Strikes Again\"). Brooks was awarded with her first leading role in a feature film, playing Laura in the adventure thriller \"The Devil's Pipeline\" in 1940. Her performance was not well received: \"Variety\" described her as \"flat.\" Universal still saw her potential, and gave her the feminine lead in the all-star western serial \"Riders of Death Valley\".\n\nIn 1941, Jean met and married writer and future film director Richard Brooks. (Though this is known to have been her second marriage, there is no information on her first.) Shortly thereafter, Universal dropped Brooks' contract. She spent most of 1942 working bit parts, now performing under the name Jean Brooks. It is likely that she adopted her husband's name as a stage name because dancer Gene Kelly began acting in films in 1942.\n\nIn 1943, she signed a contract with RKO Radio Pictures. At RKO, Brooks was to achieve her greatest success, though stardom eluded her. She appeared in six of \"The Falcon\" mystery movies before being cast as the heroine Kiki Walker in the Val Lewton-produced horror film \"The Leopard Man\" (1943), directed by Jacques Tourneur. The film received a dismissive review in \"The New York Times\" from critic Bosley Crowther, who wrote: \"The most horrifying thing about it is that it actually gets on a screen.\"\n\nAfter filming \"The Leopard Man\", Brooks appeared in a second horror film produced by Val Lewton, playing the depressed devil-worshipper Jacqueline Gibson in \"The Seventh Victim\" (1943), the role for which she is most perhaps most widely remembered today. Though the film did not fare well with audiences at the time of its release, it would go on to receive acclaim from critics in the subsequent decades. Coincidentally, while portraying the depressed Jacqueline, Brooks' own life was falling apart: During the filming of \"The Seventh Victim\", Brooks had separated from her husband; she and Richard Brooks divorced the following year in 1944. It was also widely rumored at the time that she had begun drinking heavily. (Cecilia Maskell, the daughter of Brooks' cousin, Gloria White, later remarked that alcoholism ran in her family).\n\nAfter her much-publicized divorce from Richard Brooks in 1944, Jean remained in Los Angeles and attempted to resume her career. Though she continued to land prominent roles with RKO throughout 1944, most notably \"The Falcon and the Co-eds\" and Lewton's juvenile delinquency film \"Youth Runs Wild\", her career began to unravel and she was noticeably gaining weight as a result of her heavy drinking. She arrived at the September 1945 premiere of \"First Yank into Tokyo\" intoxicated; Kurt Crivello, a film historian who was at the premiere, described her appearance: \"Jean Brooks, sad to say, was smashed. She was very, very drunk; she must have been drinking all night on the train ... some of the people there were laughing at her. Anne Jeffreys and Jane Greer looked so embarrassed. It was really very sad.\" In other instances, Brooks would reportedly pass out in public.\n\nBy 1946, Brooks's stock at RKO had plunged to an all-time low: having played feminine leads in the Falcon pictures, she was now reduced to a bit part in \"The Falcon's Alibi\". Her struggles with alcoholism and her disheveled public appearances resulted in friction with RKO executives, and Brooks reportedly tore up her contract before they could fire her. Film historian Doug McClelland referred to Brooks as \"RKO's resident neurotic\" based on her behavior while working for the studio. Her final film with RKO was the war drama \"The Bamboo Blonde\", released in July 1946. Two years later, Brooks made her final screen appearance in the William Rowland-directed exploitation drama \"Women in the Night\" (1948).\n\nBrooks married screenwriter Richard Brooks in 1941; they divorced on September 13, 1944 in Los Angeles. In 1946, Brooks met newly returned Marine Corps veteran, William Douglas Lansford, and they married. The marriage lasted 10 years, most of which were spent while Lansford was back in the armed forces (Army) and they were stationed at various bases in the U.S. It was a happy time for her while she formed amateur theater groups and worked in productions along with her husband, who was a writer, at the various places they were stationed. However, Brooks's alcoholism persisted. Lansford, too, was a heavy drinker and soon it overwhelmed the marriage. They were divorced in 1956 and Lansford remarried to Ruth Ketcham of Long Island, New York.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Brooks married \"San Francisco Examiner\" editor Thomas H. Leddy, to whom she was married until her death. A Protestant, Brooks converted to Roman Catholicism upon her marriage to Leddy in 1956. The couple resided in San Francisco, where Brooks worked as a solicitor for classified ads.\n\nIn November 1963, Brooks was admitted to Kaiser Richmond Field Hospital in Richmond, California, suffering from complications resulting from Laennec's Cirrhosis, which she had lived with for the past five years. On November 25, 1963, Brooks fell into a hepatic coma, and died of the condition at 6:35 p.m. She was 47 years old. Her death certificate noted that she had suffered from \"nutritional inadequacy\" for 15 years, probably stemming from her alcoholism.\n\nBrooks was buried at sea the following year, on September 10, 1964. Her burial was reported in the papers in Costa Rica, though there were no obituaries, and apparently no knowledge of her death in Hollywood; her ex-husband, Richard Brooks, reportedly died in 1992 with no knowledge of her death.\n\nOn August 7, 1990, 27 years after Brooks's death, the following appeared in \"The Hollywood Reporter\": \"Anyone know the whereabouts of Jean Brooks? Once married to director Richard Brooks, thus her name, she was aka Jeanne Kelly and under contract to both Universal and RKO in the 1940s ... Even Richard B[rooks] and several of the actress' former pals say they've lost all contact with her whereabouts.\"\n\n\n"}

The gameplay is very similar to that of Atari's \"Asteroids\". The game begins with a large enemy ship dropping mines onto the field as an ominous jingle plays, and moves from the top to the bottom of the screen, where it disappears. The player's ship starts in the middle of the field with 5 lives. Numerous mines then start popping up. The player must destroy all of the mines in order to progress to the next minefield. All of the mines can be destroyed with one shot, or hit with the player's ship, costing the player a life. There are 4 types of mines. The original mines are stationary, then second level has magnetic mines that follow the player's ship if neared, the third has mines that shoot fireballs back when destroyed, and the last are magnetic fireball mines.\n\nThe original version that came packaged with the Vectrex system included a bug causing the game to crash on the thirteenth level.

He attended Harvard University, where he edited \"The Harvard Crimson\" for three years and studied under, among others, Bliss Perry and George Santayana. Graduating from Harvard in 1909, he came to San Francisco in 1910, where he worked for a publisher and began a lifelong interest in fine printing. He visited Yosemite and joined the Sierra Club in 1911. He then returned to New England to pursue the profession of accounting, studying under Clinton Scovell, a pioneer in the field of cost accounting.\n\nIn 1914 he moved again to California.

{"id": "2317299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317299", "title": "A Bigger Bang", "text": "A Bigger Bang\n\nA Bigger Bang is the 22nd British and 24th American studio album by the Rolling Stones, released on Virgin Records in September 2005 as a double album on vinyl and a single CD. This is their last studio album of original compositions to date though a followup has been long promised.\n\nUnlike their prior effort eight years before, the sprawling and eclectic \"Bridges to Babylon\", which had a bewildering array of producers, musical styles, and guest musicians, the Stones set out to make a basic, hard rock album that hearkened back to their 1970s heyday. A single producer, Don Was, was brought in to co-produce the album alongside the band's principal songwriting and production team of vocalist Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Joining the two were band members Ronnie Wood on guitar and Charlie Watts on drums, contract players Darryl Jones on bass and Chuck Leavell on keyboards, and multi-instrumentalist Matt Clifford. Most of the basic tracks were recorded as a simple trio of Jagger, Richards, and Watts, with overdubs added later by other players.\n\nThe return-to-basics method of recording the album paid off for the Stones, who saw the album reach number three in the US, number two in the UK, and number one in eleven countries around the world. The lead single, \"Streets of Love\", failed to chart in the US, but was otherwise successful around the world, reaching number 15 in the UK and top-40 in over a dozen other counties. Two other singles were released to moderate worldwide sales. Reviews of the album were generally favorable; while critics noted that the album was not up to the standards of the Stones classic period, it nonetheless was among the best reviewed of their later albums. The follow-up tour, which lasted two years, would become the highest-grossing tour of all time by its completion. A Martin Scorsese-directed concert film titled \"Shine a Light\" documented the tour.\n\nThe album used a stripped-down style reminiscent of \"Some Girls\" (1978), but with a harder, more contemporary edge. Although initial reports stated that the Stones had \"returned to their roots\" with the record, the minimal instrumentation, rough mix, tough blues and \"garage\" rock hybrid bear certain similarities to the style of contemporary artists like the White Stripes and the Black Keys.\n\nMany songs were recorded with just the core band of Jagger, Richards and Watts. Ronnie Wood was absent from many sessions, playing on only ten of the sixteen tracks, with only occasional contributions from outside musicians comprising the recording of the album. This is also the first album where Jagger plays bass guitar on some tracks.\n\nThe Stones said in a statement that the album's title reflects \"their fascination with the scientific theory about the origin of the universe.\"\n\nThe first single, \"Streets of Love\"/\"Rough Justice\", reached No. 15 in the UK singles chart, while \"A Bigger Bang\" peaked at No. 2 on the UK charts. Another song, \"Sweet Neo Con,\" was critical of the conservative Christian movement in American politics.\n\nIn August 2005, the Rolling Stones embarked on the 90-show A Bigger Bang Tour in support of the album. It was met with sold-out tickets at every destination, usually within minutes of going on sale. The tour was extended into 2007 because Richards got hurt falling out of a tree in Fiji and required surgery in New Zealand. The tour concluded in August 2007 at the O2 Arena in London.\n\nCritical reaction was mostly positive. The aggregate score of the album by Metacritic was rated 73 out of 100, categorizing the reviews as \"generally favorable.\" \"A Bigger Bang\" was touted as the best Rolling Stones album in years. Nevertheless, all of the Stones albums since 1989's \"Steel Wheels\" had been similarly lauded, and many critics and fans felt that the Stones had yet to record a late-period album truly up to their high standards. It was chosen as one of Amazon.com's Top 100 Editor's Picks of 2005, and ranked the second-best album of the year by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, behind rapper Kanye West's \"Late Registration\".\n\n\"A Bigger Bang\" went platinum in the US and Germany, and gold in Japan. According to Nielsen SoundScan it sold 546,000 copies in the US, and as of 31 March 2006, 2.4 million copies worldwide according to EMI.\n\nIn 2009, \"A Bigger Bang\" was reissued by Universal Music Group. The US re-release was handled by Interscope Records, while Polydor Records handled all other territories.\n\nCredits adapted from album liner notes.\n\n\n\n"}

He commanded the \"Susanna\" on the second East India Company voyage in 1604. During this voyage his crew was reduced to fourteen men and one of the ships vanished. On the third voyage he commanded the \"Red Dragon\" and the \"Hector\" in 1607. During this voyage he met with an ambassador from the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1608 at Bantam (city).

{"id": "2317340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317340", "title": "Friday the 13th Part III", "text": "Friday the 13th Part III\n\nFriday the 13th Part III is a 1982 American slasher film directed by Steve Miner, produced by Frank Mancuso Jr., and starring Dana Kimmell, Paul Kratka, and Richard Brooker as Jason Voorhees. It is the third installment in the \"Friday the 13th\" film series. Set directly after the events of \"Friday the 13th Part 2\", the plot follows a teenage girl and her friends at a house on Crystal Lake, where a wounded Jason Voorhees has taken refuge. The film marks the debut of Voorhees wearing his signature hockey mask, which has become a trademark of both the character and the franchise, as well as an icon in American cinema and the horror genre in general.\n\nThe original storyline was supposed to focus on a post-traumatic Ginny Field who began learning self defense and returned to college after surviving her ordeal in the previous film. After finding Paul's corpse inside her dormitory, she prepares to track down Voorhees and face him in a final confrontation. However, this concept was abandoned when Amy Steel declined to reprise her role.\n\n\"Friday the 13th Part III\" was theatrically released in 3D, and is the only film in the series to be released in that format. The film was intended to end the series as a trilogy, however, unlike many of its successors, the film did not include a moniker in its title to indicate it as such. The film was theatrically released on August 13, 1982, grossing $36.7 million at the US box office on a budget of $2.2 million, and received negative reviews from critics. It was the first film to remove \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" from the number-one box office spot and became the second highest-grossing horror film of 1982, behind \"Poltergeist\". It has the third most attendance of the \"Friday the 13th\" franchise, with approximately 11,762,400 tickets sold. It was followed by \"\".\n\nCrystal Lake residents Edna and Harold Hockett are watching news of of the night before. Jason Voorhees breaks into their mom & pop store to steal supplies and clothes, and stabs Harold with a meat cleaver and Edna with one of her knitting needles. Meanwhile, Chris Higgins and her college friends travel to Higgins Haven, her parents' vacation home on Crystal Lake, to spend the weekend. The gang includes Andy, his pregnant girlfriend Debbie, prankster Shelly Finkelstein, his blind date Vera Sanchez and stoners Chuck Garth and Chili Jachson. After running into a man named Abel, who warns them to turn back, the gang meets Chris' boyfriend Rick Bombay at their destination.\n\nAt a convenience store, Shelly and Vera enter a confrontation with bikers Ali, Fox, and Loco. Shelly climbs in the car and knocks down their motorcycles, impressing Vera. When the bikers show up at Higgins Haven, they siphon gas from Chris' van, intending to burn the barn down as revenge, Jason, who has been hiding in the barn, murders Fox and Loco. Ali sneaks up on Jason and attacks him with a machete, and is then knocked dead. That night, Chris and Rick head out into the woods. Chris tells Rick the main reason she returned is to confront her fears, and she explains about how a deformed man was stalking her in the woods two years earlier. She managed to flee to safety and was scared of Crystal Lake; only agreeing to return to confront her fear and host the getaway.\n\nBack at Higgins Haven, Shelly scares Vera with a hockey mask and then wanders into the barn, where Jason slashes his throat. Taking his mask to conceal his face, Jason proceeds to murder the remainder of the group. Vera retrieves Shelly's wallet from under the dock and is shot in the eye with a speargun. Jason enters the house and bisects a hand-standing Andy with a machete. Debbie finishes her shower and rests on a hammock, where Jason thrusts a knife through her chest from beneath, killing her. When the power goes out in the house, Chuck goes downstairs to the basement only for Jason to hurl him into the fuse box, electrocuting him. Chili realizes that every other member of the group is dead. She is then impaled with a hot fire poker.\n\nWhen Rick's car dies, Chris and Rick are forced to walk back to the house to find it in disarray. Rick steps outside to search the grounds, but Jason grabs him and crushes his skull with his bare hands, killing him. Jason then attacks Chris, who narrowly escapes the house and tries to flee in her van, which breaks down due to its gas being siphoned by the bikers earlier. Chris makes her way to the barn to hide, but Jason attacks her again. After Chris hangs him, Jason unmasks himself temporarily to free himself, revealing to Chris that he is the man who attacked her two years ago. She then sees Ali, who was only stunned by Jason earlier. Jason resumes his attack on Ali and severs his left hand. The distraction allows Chris to strike Jason in the head with an axe. Jason staggers momentarily towards her before finally collapsing. Exhausted, Chris pushes a canoe out into the lake and falls asleep.\n\nChris has a nightmare of an unmasked Jason running towards her from the house before disappearing, which then turns into the decomposing body of Pamela Voorhees, with her head attached, emerging from the lake to pull her in. The scene changes to morning where the police arrive and escort a traumatized Chris from Higgins Haven. Jason's body is shown to still be lying in the barn as the lake is displayed at peace.\n\nThe film scholar Jim Harper has noted \"Friday the 13th Part III\" for its final girl character, Chris, suffering from childhood trauma resulting from sexual assault, which leaves her unable to engage in intimate relationships, although there is no undisputed evidence of what has really happened to her. In the film, Chris' trauma stems from an attack she survived from Jason Voorhees, which leaves her \"mentally scarred.\" According to Jim Harper's interpretation, in comparison to the final girl characters in other contemporaneous slasher films such as \"Halloween\" (1978) or \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (1984), Chris' failure to engage in sexual relations is a function of trauma as opposed to \"repress[ion] or dysfunct[ion].\"\n\nInitially, one of the earlier drafts for \"Part III\" was Ginny (Amy Steel) from the previous film being sent to a psychiatric hospital and confined there. Suffering from the events of \"Part 2\", she eventually finds out that Jason Voorhees survived from his wound and tracks her down to the hospital, murdering the staff and other patients at the hospital. At the time, Steel turned down the role due to her involvement in other projects, resulting in significant script changes. Steel recalled: \"They really wanted me for \"Part III\". They didn't have a script, but they were just going to show me some sort of outline. Then my agents got involved, and I don't know if it was a money issue or a script issue, but I didn't do it.\"\n\nScreenwriter Ron Kurz, who had written \"Part II\", was offered to draft a screenplay, but also turned the project down. Husband-and-wife screenwriting duo Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson instead were hired to write the screenplay for \"Part III\", completing the first draft. Paramount subsequently brought in Petru Popescu to alter the screenplay and make it \"more sinister and menacing.\" Though the final filmed version of the script contained significant contributions from Popescu, he remained uncredited.\n\nThe script for \"Part III\" called for Jason to wear a mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in \"Part 2\"; this mask would become a trademark for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come.\n\nScreenwriter Popescu said casting was based on looks rather than talent, and recalled that his vision of the characters was at significant odds with the cast chosen by director Steve Miner. Dana Kimmel was cast in the lead role of Chris Higgins after Miner had become aware of her involvement in \"Sweet Sixteen\", another slasher film she had appeared in with Bo Hopkins and Susan Strasberg. Tracie Savage, who had previously worked as a child actor, was offered the role through her agent. Larry Zerner was discovered by casting directors while walking along a street, and was offered the role of Shelly. For the role of Jason Voorhees, Miner cast British stuntman Richard Brooker.\n\nGeorgetown Productions, who had produced the previous two installments in the \"Friday the 13th\" series, was initially involved in the pre-production of \"Part III\", agreeing with distributor Paramount Pictures to shoot the film with 3-D cameras, making it the first Paramount film produced in 3-D since \"Jivaro\" in 1954. Paramount leased two 3-Depix cameras from the photography company Marks Polarized Corporation to shoot the film. Simultaneously, Paramount executive Al Lo Presti was researching current 3-D camera technology with the intention of developing a 3-D lens to be owned and used exclusively by Paramount.\n\nAccording to a September 1982 issue of \"Forbes\" magazine, Sirius II Corp. owner Gale Weaver visited the set of \"Friday the 13th Part III\", reportedly over producer Frank Mancuso, Jr.'s worries that faulty projection lenses at cinemas would prevent the film from having a wide theatrical release. Over a two-week period, Weaver developed a prototype lens that would be adaptable to \"almost all theater projectors\"; Paramount subsequently awarded Sirius II Corp. $1 million to manufacture the lenses, which would be used in projection—to the exclusion of Marks projection lenses. Marks Polarized Corporation subsequently filed a $25 million lawsuit against Paramount, alleging that the studio was \"monopolizing the marketing of 3-D exhibition materials, as well as providing deductions to theaters choosing to lease projection lenses directly from Paramount.\" Paramount ultimately agreed to credit Marks Polarized Corporation onscreen with the statement: \"Filmed utilizing the Marks 3-Depix® Converter,\" but the company was denied an injunction that would have required Paramount to change its equipment.\n\n\"Friday the 13th Part III\" was shot on location at the Valuzet Movie Ranch in Saugus, California. It was the first film in the series not to be shot on the East coast. The house, barn, and lake featured in the film were all custom-built. The house remained on the ranch lot until it burnt down in 2012. Additional photography for the film's grocery store scenes took place at a small market in Green Valley, California.\n\nBecause of the newness of the 3-D camera lenses, the shooting process was extensive, with the crew sometimes taking hours to set up a shot, and the cast performing multiple takes of scenes in order for the cinematographer to properly capture the 3-D effects. Actor Larry Zerner recalled that perfecting the 3-D effects often superseded the actors' performances: \"It quickly became clear that most of the time, the performances didn't matter. When we were shooting the scene at the convenience store with the gang members and I had to throw a wallet at the camera, it was, \"Hit the camera!\" Then, after ten takes it was \"Hit the camera, asshole!\"\" Actress Tracie Savage echoed this sentiment, stating that \"it didn't matter how the lines were delivered.\"\n\nThe decision to dress Jason Voorhees in his now-signature hockey mask occurred during a lighting check on set; the film's 3-D effects supervisor Martin Sadoff was a hockey fan, and supplied a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask to Miner. Miner loved the mask, but during test shots found it was too small. Using a technique called VacuForm, makeup effects director Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, art director Terry Ballard placed new red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were also punched into the mask, and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's original template. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances, and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one piece mask would simply slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.\n\nThe film's music was composed by Harry Manfredini, who previously composed the scores of the series' first two installments. A disco theme was also included in the film, co-written by Manfredini and Michael Zager, who shared a credit with a fictional band called Hot Ice. The theme was included on releases of the film's soundtrack, and according to Manfredini, became popular at disco and gay clubs at the time.\n\nUpon the release of the third film in 1982, Gramavision Records released a LP album of selected pieces of Manfredini's scores from the first three \"Friday the 13th\" films. On January 13, 2012, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 6-CD boxset containing Manfredini's scores from the first six films. It sold out in less than 24 hours.\n\n\"Friday the 13th Part III\" was released theatrically in the United States on Friday, August 13, 1982. It was the first-ever 3-D film to receive a wide domestic release, opening on 1,079 screens. Of these screens, 813 were 3-D capable, while the remainder consisted of drive-in theaters which were unable to accommodate the format. In order to allow non-3-D-capable theaters to screen the film, Paramount completed a seven-week-long conversion process that cost $2 million, \"an amount equal to the picture’s entire negative cost.\" It was also the first film in the series to be presented in Dolby Stereo upon its theatrical release.\n\nThe film grossed $9,406,522 in its opening weekend and broke the opening horror film record held by \"Friday the 13th\" (1980). Domestically, the film made a total of $36.7 million. It placed number 21 on the list of the top-grossing films of 1982, facing strong competition from other high-profile horror releases such as \"Poltergeist\", \"Creepshow\", \"The Thing\", \"\", \"The Slumber Party Massacre\", \"X-ray\", \"Visiting Hours\", \"\", \"Silent Rage\", \"The Beast Within\", \"Cat People\" and \"Venom\". As of 2018, it still stands as the fourth highest-grossing film in the \"Friday the 13th\" series and the third best selling in ticket sales; with approximately 11,762,400 tickets sold, it is surpassed only by the 1980 original with 14,778,700 tickets and \"Freddy vs. Jason\" with 13,701,900 tickets. The film also stands as the tenth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1982, the second-highest grossing horror film of 1982, the sixth largest box office opening of 1982, and adjusted for inflation it is the ninth highest-grossing slasher film of all time.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Friday the 13th Part III\" holds a 12% approval rating based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 3.56/10. The consensus reads: “Jason may solidify his iconic wardrobe in this entry, but \"Friday the 13th Part 3\" lacks any other distinguishing features, relying on a tired formula of stab and repeat.”\n\nWhile criticizing the plot for being derivative, in a mixed review for \"The New York Times\", film critic Janet Maslin praised the acting of Kimmell, Savage, Rogers, and Parks, in which she called a major improvement to the acting in the predecessors, and wrote that Miner's use of 3-D filmmaking was innovative and the most professional effort when compared to other films released at the time, stating: \"As in each of the other recent 3-D movies, of which this is easily the most professional, there is a lot of time devoted to trying out the gimmick. Titles loom toward you. Yo-yos spin. Popcorn bounces. Snakes dart toward the camera and strike. Eventually, the novelty wears off, and what remains is the now-familiar spectacle of nice, dumb kids being lopped, chopped and perforated.\"\n\nWriting for the \"Los Angeles Times\", Linda Gross wrote: \"Ironically, \"Friday the 13th Part 3\" is so terrible that \"Friday the 13th Part 1\" and \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" don't seem so bad.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" stated that it \"would be a little better than \"Part I\" or \"Part II\" even without 3-D\". In continuing to compare the film to its predecessors, Maslin commented that \"it's a little more adept at teasing the audience.\" Richard Schickel of \"Time\" magazine wrote: \"Maybe all sequels should be made in 3-D... It is all so gruesome that horror turns to humor and fun comes from the appreciation of being cleverly conned by Steve Miner. The way the eyeball of one of Jason's victims pops out of his skull and seems to sail over the audience's head is alone worth buying a ticket and putting on funny glasses.\" Gene Siskel praised the film's \"impressive\" 3-D effects, particularly in the opening credits, also noting its slowburn approach, as the \"heavy-duty slaughter doesn't come until one hour into the film,\" but criticized it for \"lingering over the impending deaths of the young women, who are stalked by the camera so we find ourselves in the revolting position of stalking them too.\"\n\nThe entertainment-trade magazine \"Variety\" provided a general consensus, stating, \"\"Friday the 13th\" was dreadful and took in more than $17 million. \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" was just as bad and took in more than $10 million. \"Friday the 13th Part 3\" is terrible, too.\" The magazine added, \"There are some dandy 3-D sequences, however, of a yo-yo going up and down and popcorn popping.\" Similarly, \"TV Guide\" awarded the film one out of five stars, writing that it \"exploits precisely the same formula plot as its predecessors, though the gore is a bit deemphasized, with the special-effects crew concentrating on the nicely done 3-D depth work for a change. It's still trash, however, and also made a ridiculous amount of money.\"\n\n\"Friday the 13th Part III\" was first made available on home video on VHS in 1983 by Paramount Home Entertainment. It was also released on CED. Paramount reissued the VHS on September 28, 1994. Paramount later issued a DVD edition, with the film presented only in standard 2-D form, on October 17, 2000. The 2-D version was subsequently included in a box set, titled \"From Crystal Lake to Manhattan\", released in 2004, and featuring the first eight films in the series; this disc features an audio commentary track with several cast members, moderated by historian Peter Bracke.\n\nThe 3-D version of the film was eventually released on DVD by Paramount in February 2009, and included two pairs of cyan and red 3-D glasses. In June of that year, a \"Deluxe Edition\" Blu-ray edition (which includes both the 2-D and 3-D versions) was released, also with two pairs of cyan and red 3-D glasses designed to look like Jason's mask.\n\nThe film was included in a further two Blu-ray sets: \"Friday the 13th: The Complete Collection\", released in 2013, and \"Friday the 13th: The Ultimate Collection\", in 2018.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\"Friday the 13th Part III\" was followed by \"\" (1984). Uniquely, the film was novelized twice. The first book was written by Michael Avallone and published in 1982 to coincide with the release of the film, while the second adaptation was published in 1988 by Signet. The latter novelization was written by Simon Hawke, who had previously written novelizations for the first, second, and sixth installments in the series.\n\n\"Friday the 13th Part III\" has been most noted for its introduction of villain Jason's hockey mask disguise, which was replicated in the following numerous sequels and became an iconic image in American cinema and the horror genre. Film scholar Carol Clover notes that the film has historically been cited as one of the most violent of the series, with a total of fourteen murder sequences. \nFor his appearance in the film, Jason Voorhees was nominated for AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains as one of the Top 50 Villains. Meslow cites the film's 3-D effects as paving the way for later horror films which also used the technique.\n\n\n"}

It carries US 17/SR 404 Spur. The original bridge was built in 1953; a replacement bridge was completed in 1991, also referred to as the Talmadge Memorial Bridge.\n\nThe original Talmadge bridge was a cantilever truss bridge built in 1953. It eventually became a danger for large ships entering the Port of Savannah, home to the largest single ocean container terminal on the U.S. eastern seaboard, and the nation's fourth-busiest seaport. A replacement better able to not impede maritime traffic was completed in March 1991.

After public forums on the issue, the original name was restored for the new structure.\n\nTalmadge was an old-school conservative Southern Democrat, who pursued then-popular and openly racist objectives such as restoring the white primary and enforcing segregation of the state universities. He also struck out against opposing centers of power, using martial law to dismiss state boards that opposed his measures as well as arrest both strikers and strikebreakers alike, actions which led to him both being accused of being a dictator as well as being a friend of the \"common man.\" Talmadge's legacy has caused some in Savannah to oppose letting him have the prominent honor of the bridge named for him, including Savannah's City Council. However, renaming the bridge is decided at the state level by the legislature, where there is considerably more sympathy for Talmadge.\n\nIn September 2017, Savannah City Council passed a resolution to rename the bridge the \"Savannah Bridge\". A state representative said, \"It's time to move forward on a bridge that reminds us of segregation and not solidarity and a name that connects to hate and not hope.\" It is ultimately up to the Georgia state government to confirm the passed resolution. Another proposal, pushed by the Girl Scouts, is to rename the bridge after Juliette Gordon Low, a Savannah native who founded the Girl Scouts. One argument that the pro-renaming faction has raised is that the 1991 bridge may never have actually been formally named at all in the records, meaning it was never the Talmadge Memorial Bridge to begin with.\n\nThe new bridge provides of vertical navigational clearance for oceangoing vessels. Its horizontal clearance is , with both main piers located on the north and south banks of the Savannah River. With a main span of and a total length of , the new Talmadge Memorial carries four lanes of traffic. The north end of the bridge ends on Hutchinson Island, an island situated between the Savannah River and the Back River. A separate, older, two-lane bridge spans Back River, connecting Hutchinson Island with Jasper County, South Carolina.\n\nThe proximity and rivalry between Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah and Brunswick often lead to comparisons between the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, the Sidney Lanier Bridge, and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge, all of which carry US 17. Completed in 2005, the clearance under the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is actually only taller than both the Sidney Lanier Bridge and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge. Unlike the Sidney Lanier Bridge and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge, however, the Ravenel Bridge has eight travel lanes; the Talmadge and the Sidney Lanier both have just four lanes. The Ravenel also features a dedicated bike/pedestrian lane. The Talmadge Memorial Bridge also has a similar design as the Alex Fraser Bridge in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nAs for the span of the three bridges, The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is . The Sidney Lanier Bridge is . The Talmadge Memorial Bridge is .\n\nAs for the total length of the three bridges, the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is . The Sidney Lanier Bridge is . The Talmadge Memorial Bridge is , or .\n\nSavannah is currently undergoing expansion, the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP), so the port can accommodate newer, larger vessels. In September 2018, \"Savannah Now\" reported officials thought the Talmadge Bridge may need to be replaced if the port was to service Neo-Panamax vessels.\n"}

It is located near the town of Belogradchik in northwestern Bulgaria, at the foot of the Western Balkan Mountains. The other observatory operated by the same institute is the Rozhen Observatory.\n\nBuilt in 1961 by a group of astronomy enthusiasts led by high school physics teacher and later chief assistant professor in Sofia University Hristo Kostov (1932-1982), Belogradchik Observatory became the first school observatory in Bulgaria. Official opening ceremony was held on 21.06.1965, by its first director Dr. Alexander Tomov (1930-2009), and was attended by much of Bulgarian leading astronomers - Acad. Nikola Bonev (1898-1979), Prof. Malina Popova (1922-2011), Prof. Tsvetan Bonchev, Assoc. Prof. Bogomil Kovachev, and already Chief Assist. Prof. Hristo Kostov. From 1964 till 1974 it was used as an auxiliary observational base for tracking Soviet satellites amidst the Space Race era. In the late 1960s additional working studies were built, adjacent to the lecture-hall and the dome. During his serve time as a director (1964-1988) Dr. Tomov referred to the Soviet experience in developing the infrastructure of the observatory, and implemented much of the methods of the Soviet astronomy school. Notable examples of cooperation are those with Acad. B.A. Vorontsov-Velyaminov (1904-1994) (see also Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies and Catalogue of Interacting Galaxies), Prof. (1918-2008), Dr. (b.1940), among other members of Sternberg Astronomical Institute (ГАИШ) and (AН СССР). In 1976 the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences took over operation. Since then the observatory was used entirely for scientific research, in cooperation with astronomers from the Department of Astronomy at Faculty of Physics of Sofia University and members of foreign institutes. By the time the Institute of Astronomy became a separate structure of the Academy in 1995, the observatory saw a notable revival. During the 1990s and 2000s Assoc. Prof. Dr. Alexander Antov, a second long term director of the observatory, modernized both its residential and scientific facilities, including the addition of a smaller dome in 1994. Its current director is Assoc. Prof. Dr. Anton Strigachev. In July 2015 the observatory marked its 50 years of operation by hosting the X annual conference of the Bulgarian Astronomical Society (SAB).\n\nThe observatory started out with a single 15 cm Cassegrain telescope by Zeiss. Then in August 1969 it was replaced by a 60 cm Cassegrain telescope, mounted in the same 5 m dome of the previous one. Primary focal length is 2400 mm, while focal length at Cassegrain focus is 7500 mm, with a relative aperture of f/12.5. Field of view at Cassegrain focus is 20'. Main instrument also accommodates a smaller 110 mm refractor finder with a focal length of 750 mm and a field of view of 2 degrees. Between 1969 and 1980 it was the biggest telescope on the Balkans to be eclipsed by the 2 m RCC telescope of Rozhen Observatory, which held this title until 2007. The purchase of the telescope was worth 200 000 leva, an enormous value at that time. Both instruments were manufactured by the German Carl Zeiss AG. The connections established with the manufacturer later helped purchase and equip instruments for the Bulgarian National Rozhen Observatory, which also has a twin 60 cm Cassegrain telescope. Currently the 15 cm telescope is used for visitor demonstrations only. In 1994 another catadioptric telescope was added in a separate, smaller dome - a 14-inch (36 cm) Schmidt-Cassegrain model.\n\nIn 1973 the first Bulgarian single channel electro-photometer was constructed and mounted on the main instrument, operating in photon counting regime, using the UBV photometric system of filters and five diaphragms (0.5–5 mm). It was upgraded a couple of years later with an EMI-9789 QA photomultiplier. In 1997 the photometer's preamp-discriminator module was changed with a new one built in Ukraine. It is still used occasionally for bright stars. A ST-8 CCD camera was used between 1997 and 2008. Since 2008 the main 60 cm telescope is equipped with a CCD camera FLI PL-9000, manufactured by Finger Lakes Instrumentation (USA). It uses a KAF-09000 chip with a resolution of 3056 x 3056 px without binning, and a 16-bit ADC. The pixel size is 12 µm which gives, with this telescope, a scale of 0.330 arcsec/px without binning and 1.0 arcsec/px with binning 3 x 3. The field of view is 17' x 17'. BVRcIc Johnson-Cousins standard filters are used.\n\nAt first the observatory has been used for satellite astrometry (1960s-1970s). Between 1964 and 1974 more than 1000 Soviet satellites were observed and data sent to Mission Control Centre in Moscow for orbit corrections. Later, during the 1970s and 1980s, Photo-electric surveys of more than 200 catalogue double and multiple galaxies (1970s-1980s) were carried out. Holmberg effect was used to confirm or rule out physical and visual systems (binaries and multiplets). Notable results were included in \"A General Catalogue of Photoelectric Magnitudes and Colours in the UBV System of 3578 Galaxies,\nBrighter than the 16-th V Magnitude (1936-1982)\" by G. Longo, Antoinette de Vaucouleurs and H.G. Corwin (1983) (see also Gérard de Vaucouleurs), with significant part of its data obtained from Belogradchik observatory. During the 1990s, beside fast stellar electro-photometry of variable stars, it was also a base for meticulous observations of minor bodies of the Solar System, including the famous Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet encounter with Jupiter in July 1994. In recent years Romanian astronomers have jointly used the observatory for an astrometry project, linked to the Gaia programme, prior to its launch in December 2013. It was by that time an automatic seismograph was mounted in an adjacent isolated compartment, where it serves both Romanian and Bulgarian seismologists. Current field of research involves CCD observations mainly of a long range of variable star types, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN) - namely blazars. Observations are performed by researchers of several teams, as part of respective national and international scientific projects. Through the years Belogradchik Observatory saw cooperation and conducted simultaneous observations with similar facilities in Ukraine (Crimean Astrophysical Observatory), Russia (Terskol Observatory (Caucasus)), Armenia (Byurakan Observatory), Greece (Skinakas Observatory (Crete), and Chelmos Observatory (Peloponnese)), Serbia, Romania, Slovakia (Skalnaté pleso Observatory (Tatry)), Czech Republic (Ondřejov Observatory), Poland (Toruń Observatory), Germany, France, and India, among others. Simultaneous observations with Rozhen Observatory are also regularly carried out. Observational time is managed and distributed by a specialized time allocation committee of the institute.\n\n\n"}

After her first marriage to Greg Smith failed, Cheryl took part in several West End theatre shows, during one of which she met entertainer Michael Barrymore in 1974. They married two years later.\n\nCheryl and Michael married in 1976, although not until after he had paid off his mother, who threatened to reveal a previous 18-month-long gay love affair. She later claimed, without contradiction from her estranged husband, that they had had a \"full\" marriage, including connubial relations. With Cheryl as Michael's manager and the mastermind behind his meteoric rise, he won a 1979 edition of \"New Faces\". He later became a panelist on \"Blankety Blank\" and the warm-up man for Larry Grayson on the \"Generation Game\".\n\nFrom there Michael rose to fame presenting ITV entertainment show \"Strike It Lucky\" from 1986, followed by \"Kids Say the Funniest Things\" and \"My Kind of Music\". He was voted the UK's favourite TV star several times, and became one of the highest-paid stars on TV. Cheryl later said that Michael had problems with alcohol, drugs, gambling and depression. As a result of her husband's physical assault on her at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles, California, she was placed by British police on the \"at risk\" register.\n\nAt the height of his popularity, Michael Barrymore suffered increasing alcohol problems. He claimed that he had wanted to seek help, but that his wife told him: \"No, you’re not (alcoholic). Don’t be stupid.\"\n\nIn November 1995, Michael attended the National Television Awards, where, clearly drunk, he made a rambling, incoherent speech. At an after-show party on a live late night radio show, he publicly declared he was gay and \"no longer wanted to live a lie\", following which he and Cheryl split up. She later claimed that Michael took the step and didn't tell her because of his talks with Princess Diana.\n\nAfter several aborted reunions, they divorced in 1997 and Cheryl went on to publish the autobiography \"Catch a Falling Star\", which contained details of their acrimonious split. The couple became estranged, and she ceased acting on her husband's behalf as either agent or manager.\n\nCheryl went on to manage other artists, including Rebecca Loos and ex-EastEnder Danniella Westbrook, the latter of whom she urged to get help for her drug addiction, leading to Westbrook becoming temporarily clean of drugs in 2001.\n\nMichael later wrote in his 2006 autobiography, \"Awight Now: Setting the Record Straight\", that Cheryl was a control freak who controlled his every movement including his clothes, and she had created the character that was \"Michael Barrymore\", which drove him to alcohol, drugs and gay affairs.\n\nAfter her split with Michael, Cheryl's health suffered. On 1 April 2005, she died, aged 55, at St John and St Elizabeth Hospital in St John's Wood, having been diagnosed with lung cancer six weeks earlier. \n"}

Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States, May 30, 1953) is a United States composer and harpist.\n\nAnne LeBaron holds a B.A. in music from the University of Alabama (1974), an M.A. in music from the State University of New York at Stony Brook (1978), and a doctorate in music from Columbia University (1989), where she studied with Chou Wen-chung and Mario Davidovsky. As a Fulbright Scholar in 1980–81, she studied with Mauricio Kagel and György Ligeti . LeBaron has also studied Korean traditional music at The National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts in Seoul (1983) . Although trained in piano from childhood, she took up the harp in college; in 1974 and 1976, she studied privately with Alice Chalifoux at the Salzedo Harp Colony.\n\nLeBaron served as composer-in-residence in Washington, DC, sponsored by Meet the Composer from 1993 until 1996 . She was Assistant Professor of Music at the University of Pittsburgh from 1996 to 2000. Beginning in 2001, she was appointed Professor of Music at the California Institute of the Arts, where she has held the Roy E. Disney Family Chair in Musical Composition since 2013. Her awards include an ASCAP Foundation Grant and a BMI Student Composer Award (1979), the GEDOK International Prize in Mannheim (1982), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1991–1992), the Alpert Award in the Arts (1996–1997), a Cultural Exchange International Grant in 2009 from the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs for \"The Silent Steppe Cantata\" (2011), and the Toulmin Grant from Opera America (2014).\n\nLeBaron's composition in instrumental, electronic, and performance realms embraces a wide range of media and styles. Frequently combining tonal and atonal techniques, she has utilized elements of blues, jazz, pop, rock, and folk music in such scores as the opera \"The E & O Line\" (1993), \"American Icons\" (1996) for orchestra, and \"Traces of Mississippi\" (2000) for chorus, orchestra, poet narrators, and rap artists. She has also used American literary sources with \"Devil in the Belfry\" (1993) for violin and piano, inspired by Edgar Allan Poe, and the Gertrude Stein setting \"Is Money Money\" (2000) for soprano and chamber ensemble. Among her multi-cultural compositions are \"Lamentation/Invocation\" (1984) for baritone and three instruments, using Korean-derived gestures and long sustained tones for the voice; \"Noh Reflections\" (1985) for string trio, which draws upon the music of Japanese Noh theater; \"Breathtails\" (2012) for baritone, string quartet, and Japanese shakuhachi; and her large-scale celebration of Kazakhstan, \"The Silent Steppe Cantata\" for tenor, women's chorus, and an orchestra of traditional Kazakh instruments.\n\nWriting about LeBaron's 1989 \"Telluris Theoria Sacra\" (for flute/piccolo, clarinet/bass clarinet, violin, viola, cello, percussion, and piano), musicologist Susan McClary notes that the work \"...points to LeBaron's more pervasive interest in music's ability to mold temporality, immersing the listener in a sound world in which time bends, stands still, dances, or conforms to the mechanical measure of the clock\" .\n\nTheater has played an important role in LeBaron's music, with such scores as \"Concerto for Active Frogs\" (1974) for voices, three instruments, and tape, and the harp solos \"I Am an American ... My Government Will Reward You\" (1988) and \"Hsing\" (2002). She has also composed a series of monodramas for female voice and chamber musicians: \"Pope Joan\" (2000), \"Transfiguration\" (2003), \"Sucktion\" (2008), and \"Some Things Should Not Move\" (2013). LeBaron's operas \"The E & O Line\", \"Croak (The Last Frog)\" (1996), and \"Wet\" (2005) were all collaborative works that led her to develop the genre she terms \"hyperopera\": \"an opera resulting from intensive collaboration across all the disciplines essential for producing opera in the 21st century – in a word, a 'meta-collaborative' undertaking\" .\n\nWith her hyperopera \"Crescent City\" (2012, libretto by Douglas Kearney), LeBaron went a step beyond the nineteenth-century concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk (the united/total/universal artwork that synthesized architecture, scenic painting, singing, instrumental music, poetry, drama, and dance), championed by Richard Wagner. A more lateral, inclusive, and intensive collaboration of artists occurs with hyperopera, breaking down the usual hierarchical structures of traditional opera, which define and limit the roles of individuals on creative and production teams. The genre of hyperopera involves the collaborations of a diverse group of artists that can portray a variety of meanings or realities . In the postmodern tradition of redefining opera, also seen in the work of Robert Ashley, Meredith Monk, and Robert Wilson, LeBaron replaced the Wagnerian orchestra with smaller and more specialized forces of instruments and electronic sound for \"Crescent City\", with musicians who move readily among stylistic genres, just as the vocalists do. The opera's theatrical action is refracted through a prism of video work, lighting effects, and performance freedoms and simultaneities. For its world premiere production in Los Angeles in 2012, \"Crescent City\" also engaged six visual artists to participate in the collaborative process by designing and building set pieces as various locales in the opera.\n\nAs an improviser LeBaron employs a wide array of extended techniques for the harp, including preparing the harp (similar to John Cage's prepared piano) and bowing the strings, as well as a variety of electronic enhancements. Her development of a new performance vocabulary for the instrument began in the early 1970s, when she played in the Alabama improvising ensemble Trans Museq along with Davey Williams and LaDonna Smith. Her career as an improviser has included performance collaborations with such creative composer/musicians as Anthony Braxton, Muhal Richard Abrams, Evan Parker, George Lewis, Derek Bailey, Leroy Jenkins, Lionel Hampton, and Shelley Hirsch. LeBaron's double-CD \"1, 2, 4, 3\" (Innova 236, 2010) features collaborations with thirteen different musicians in solo, duo, quartet, and trio configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2317414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317414", "title": "Biennio Rosso", "text": "Biennio Rosso\n\nThe Biennio Rosso (English: \"Red Biennium\" or \"Two Red Years\") was a two-year period, between 1919 and 1920, of intense social conflict in Italy, following the First World War. The revolutionary period was followed by the violent reaction of the Fascist blackshirts militia and eventually by the March on Rome of Benito Mussolini in 1922.\n\nThe Biennio Rosso took place in a context of economic crisis at the end of the war, with high unemployment and political instability. It was characterized by mass strikes, worker manifestations as well as self-management experiments through land and factories occupations. Tension had been rising since the final years of the war. Some contemporary observers considered Italy to be on the brink of a revolution by the end of 1918.\n\nThe population was confronted with rising inflation and a significant increase in the price of basic goods, in a period that extensive unemployment was aggravated by mass demobilization of the Royal Italian Army at the end of the war. Association to the trade unions, the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), and the anarchist movement increased substantially. The PSI increased its membership to 250,000, and the major Socialist trade union, the General Confederation of Labour (\"Confederazione Generale del Lavoro\", CGL), reached two million members, while the anarchist Italian Syndicalist Union (\"Unione Sindacale Italiana\", USI) reached between 300,000 and 500,000 affiliates. The vigour of the anarchists was boosted by the return from exile of the anarchist leader Errico Malatesta in December 1919.\n\nIn Turin and Milan, factory councils – which the leading Italian Marxist theoretician Antonio Gramsci considered to be the Italian equivalent of Russia’s soviets – were formed and many factory occupations took place under the leadership of revolutionary socialists and anarcho-syndicalists. The agitations also extended to the agricultural areas of the Padan plain and were accompanied by peasant strikes, rural unrests and armed conflicts between left-wing and right-wing militias. \n\nIndustrial action and rural unrest increased significantly: there were 1,663 industrial strikes in 1919, compared to 810 in 1913. More than one million industrial workers were involved in 1919, three times the 1913 figure. The trend continued in 1920, which saw 1,881 industrial strikes. Rural strikes also increased substantially, from 97 in 1913 to 189 by 1920, with over a million peasants taking action. On July 20-21, 1919, a general strike was called in solidarity with the Russian Revolution.\n\nIn April 1920, Turin metal-workers, in particular at the Fiat plants, went on strike demanding recognition for their 'factory councils', a demand the PSI and CGL did not support. The 'factory councils' more and more saw themselves as the models for a new democratically controlled economy running industrial plants, instead of as a bargaining tool with employers. The movement peaked in August and September 1920. Armed metal workers in Milan and Turin occupied their factories in response to a lockout by the employers. Factory occupations swept the \"industrial triangle\" of north-western Italy. Some 400,000 metal-workers and 100,000 others took part. On September 3, 185 metal-working factories in Turin had been occupied.\n\nThe PSI and CGL failed to see the revolutionary potential of the movement; had it been maximized and expanded to the rest of Italy, a revolutionary transformation might have been possible. Most Socialist leaders were pleased with the struggles in the North, but did little to capitalize on the impact of the occupations and uprisings. Without the support and quarantined, the movement for social change gradually waned.\n\nBy 1921, the movement was declining due to an industrial crisis that resulted in massive layoffs and wage cuts. In contrast to passive demeanor the PSI and CGL, employers and the upcoming fascist did react. The revolutionary period was followed by the violent reaction of the Fascist blackshirts militia (the \"Fasci Italiani di Combattimento\") and eventually by the March on Rome of Benito Mussolini in October 1922.\n\nA quantitative sociological study of the period by analyzing newspaper news in the period (see figure) clearly demonstrates the evolution of violence acts between the social groups involved.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It ran from October 12, 1991, until October 15, 1994, although Myers (who had since left the show) reprised the role once more on March 22, 1997.\n\nIn the sketches, Myers plays a stereotypical Jewish middle-aged woman with an exaggerated New York accent who sports long, painted fake nails; much gold jewelry; gaudy sweaters; large dark glasses; and big hair, which she constantly adjusts. This character was a spoof on his former real-life mother-in-law, Linda Richman.\n\nIntroduced on the January 19, 1991, episode, this sketch was originally called \"Coffee Talk with Paul Baldwin\", with Baldwin also played by Myers. The main joke was the use of as many words that accentuated the stereotypical New York accent as possible, particularly the low back chain shift that changes the vowels in words like \"dogs, daughters, lofts and coffee\" as Baldwin describes the show's preferred topics.\n\nStarting with the October 12, 1991, episode, Paul Baldwin was written out and replaced with the character of Richman as the substitute host. In subsequent episodes, Richman explains that Baldwin is a good friend of hers and is recuperating in Boca Raton, Florida, because \"he developed \"shpilkis\" in his \"genechtagazoink\"\".\n\nRichman's hero was Barbra Streisand. She constantly \"dedicated\" the show to her, often claiming her to be the greatest actress in all of history.\n\nIn what could be considered to be the sketch's most memorable moment, Myers was joined on February 22, 1992, by special guests Madonna and Roseanne Barr as other stereotypical Jewish women. Madonna also lampooned herself by having her character attack Madonna as a bad example for teenage Jewish girls (\"She's a tramp. Every week with the different boyfriend! And this week in the papers with no clothes on! Who needs her? Feh!!\"), referring to the hitchhiking scene from Madonna's \"Erotica\" video. They discussed Streisand's film \"The Prince of Tides\" (1991) on the show.\n\nNear the end of the sketch, the women compared Streisand to \"buttah\"and suddenly, a voice announced, \"All this talk about food, I'm getting hungry, girls.\" It was Streisand herself in a surprise appearance; none of the actors had any idea that she was to appear. All three managed to remain in character as the audience went wild. (Myers as Richman screamed, \"I can die now! That's all the time we have for this week; I have to go and die now!\") The real Richman, sitting in the audience that night to watch her then son-in-law lampoon her, has acknowledged having been \"tickled to death\" at that particular moment, as Streisand is one of her actual heroes as well.\n\nStreisand only stayed long enough to give each character a kiss and wave to the audience. Streisand later revealed that she had been giving a performance at Radio City Music Hall (which is located across West 50th Street from NBC Studios) and happened to overhear that the sketch was being done that night. In the television special \"Saturday Night Live: 101 Most Unforgettable Moments\", this particular sketch is moment number six.\n\nRichman would occasionally take callers. The number to call was always 555-4444, each \"four\" again said with the same accent (though, in some later airings, the 555 is bleeped out and covered up on screen, as 555-4444 is no longer a fictitious telephone number). \"Give a call, we'll talk, no big whoop.\"\n\nRichman occasionally added Yiddish or pseudo-Yiddish words into her speech: \"OK now, this show used to be hosted by my friend Paul Baldwin, but he developed \"shpilkis\" in his \"genechtagazoink\". So now he's in Boca Raton, Florida, recovering nicely, thank you very much.\" The catchphrase often used to describe things Linda admired was \"like butter\", which in the accent becomes \"like buttah\". A typical example is, \"Her voice, it's like buttah.\"\n\nWhenever Richman would get upset, she would put her hand on her chest and say \"I'm all \"verklempt\"\" or \"I'm a little \"verklempt.\"\" Then she would say, \"Talk amongst yourselves,\" sometimes waving her hand in a dismissive gesture toward the audience. She would often follow this with an example by saying, \"I'll give you a topic,\" which would typically have the structure of a bahuvrihi: \"\"[two- or three-part phrase]\" is neither \"[first part]\", nor \"[second part]\" (nor [\"third part\"]). Discuss.\" Richman would then recover after a beat.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nRichman would also make light jokes and good-natured ribbing about people raised in interfaith families, such as: someone who came from a family with Methodist and Jewish parents is called a \"Mu Shu\", whereas people who came from families with Jewish and Roman Catholic parents were called \"cashews\". In one of the final episodes of the sketch, Richman is shown with an Irish-Catholic boyfriend, who is a retired NYPD officer (played by Charlton Heston). When the boyfriend proposes marriage to her, Richman acts stunned, which prompts tremendous cheering from the female audience members.\n\nThe Fran Drescher sitcom \"The Nanny\" (1993–1999) made a direct tongue-in-cheek reference to the Richman sketches by showing brunette Fran Fine (Drescher), her blonde mother (Renée Taylor) and gray-haired grandma Yetta (Ann Guilbert) on the couch watching their respective \"Coffee Talk\" counterparts (Myers', Madonna's, and Roseanne Barr's characters) on television, all very similar in their appearance, voice and mannerisms. While fussing over their big hair in the fashion of the \"Coffee Talk\" regulars, they complain that the sketch is \"so stereotypical\".\n\nThe Richman character was inspired by Myers' then real-life mother-in-law, a woman of New York Jewish extraction who is actually named Linda Richman. During a Larry King interview of Myers, the real Richman called in and expressed good-natured amusement about the character. During his appearance on \"Inside the Actors Studio\", he claimed that his impression for the character was \"underplayed\" and that his mother-in-law actually goaded him into performing the voice of the character when they were in public together.\n\nMyers made an appearance as Richman during Streisand's '93/'94 New Year's Eve concert at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. While Streisand discussed reporting made in \"The New York Times\", Richman was heard from the audience assuring Streisand to ignore such press (\"Don't listen to that woman, Barbra; what does she know? Please! Feh!\"). Streisand then invited Richman up on stage, and they performed a comedy skit lampooning the Coffee Talk discussion topics. (Streisand: \"Now, I'm getting \"verklempt\"! [To audience:] Talk amongst yourselves. I'll give you a topic: \"The Prince of Tides\" was about neither a prince nor tidesDiscuss.\")\n\n\n"}

The town acts as the gateway to the Southern Highlands when coming from Sydney. Mittagong is situated at an elevation of . The town is close to Bowral, Berrima, Moss Vale and the Northern Villages such as Yerrinbool and Colo Vale. Moreover, Mittagong is home to many wineries of the Southern Highlands which has been a recent growing wine and cellar door region.\n\nThe town lies between three small mountain reserves, Mount Alexandra above sea level, Mount Gibraltar above sea level and Ninety Acre Hill (part of the greater Gibbergunyah Reserve) above sea level.\n\nPopular among locals and visitors is a small man made lake, Lake Alexandra, that feeds into the nearby Nattai River. Lookouts are available at all three reserves for viewing. Lookouts on Mount Gibraltar include Bowral Lookout, Mittagong Lookout and Mount Jellore Lookout. Lookouts on Mount Alexandra include Katoomba Lookout and Box Vale Track Lookout. Gibbergunyah Reserve include the Gib Lookout and Ninety Acre Hill Lookout.\n\nMount Gibraltar can also be seen up close when travelling to Bowral from Mittagong along Bowral Road.\n\nThe name \"Mittagong\" is said to come from an Aboriginal word meaning \"little mountain\". Other suggested meanings are \"a companion\" and \"plenty of native dogs\", as the Mittagong range was home to many dingos at one time.\n\nToday, the town offers visitors the chance to explore its history, scenery, small waterfalls, bushwalks and its famed \"Waratah\" flowering in November. A chamber music festival is held each Easter. Tourists can visit Mount Gibraltar, Lake Alexandra and various wineries located around and in Mittagong. It also features one of the first iron mining sites in Australia, close to Lake Alexandra. The main street boasts a wide array of retailers and antique shops.\n\nNotably, Mittagong is close to many of the Southern Highland's wineries and cellar doors. The wineries have established themselves in the region since the 1980s due to the soil and climate of Mittagong which is believed to be perfect for viticulture.\n\nMittagong is home to an abandoned historical building complex known as \"The Maltings\". In the past, The Maltings served as malthouses for the old major beer company of New South Wales, Tooth and Co. One of the malthouse buildings can be seen when entering Mittagong on the Old Hume Highway from Braemar. This building is one of the original buildings and is over 100 years old. This complex is abandoned and in decay. However, A few years ago it had been subject to an attempted renovation which was stopped shortly after.\n\nAt the , the Mittagong Statistical Area 2, which includes the Miittagong town centre and the small surrounding villages of Welby, Balaclava, Braemar and Willow Vale, had a population of 8,999. \n\nThe Mittagong State Suburb, which does not include the surrounding villages, had a population of 5,767. \n\nMittagong is on the Old Hume Highway, which linked Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne, but the highway was diverted in 1992. The opening of the bypass was expected by someto negatively affect business in towns bypassed like Mittagong, but instead the location has become a rest stop for drivers and a daytripper destination from Sydney, only around one hour away. Moreover, Mittagong can be accessed from the Hume Highway in the north via the Aylmerton/Braemar ramp and in the south via the Welby ramp.\n\nMittagong railway station is served by the Southern Highlands Line with regular services to and from Sydney and Moss Vale, with some services extending Goulburn. Long distance services to Canberra and Melbourne also stop at the station.\n\nThe town is also home to the bus company Berrima Buslines depot. Berrima Buslines services the entire Wingecarribee Shire.\n\nA number of long distance coach operators service Mittagong for Canberra, Melbourne and Adelaide. Priors Scenic Express operates a service six days a week to Greater Sydney (Campelltown, Liverpool and Parramatta) and to the Shoalhaven and South Coast of New South Wales.\n\n The first European permanent settler in the Mittagong district was William Chalker (1775–1823) (also known as Charker), a former convict transported from England, who arrived in the area on 10 May 1821. He became the Principal Overseer of Government Stock, Chief Constable and Poundkeeper in the Cowpastures. A memorial plaque to Chalker was unveiled in May 1988 as a Bicentennial project; the plaque overlooks an area once known as \"Chalker's Flat\" and later known as Lower Mittagong.\n\nAs early as February 1841 an attempt was made to sell land in a subdivision called the “Town of Gainsborough”, followed by the “Livingstone Township” subdivision in June 1842, however the sales appeared to have failed and no further attempts to subdivide were attempted for some time until the iron works came into operation.\nIn August 1861 Surveyor Campbell suggested a portion of land be reserved for village purposes. This reserve was made in 1862 and called the “Village of Fitzroy” (now Welby), and in May 1865 a subdivision consisting of 245 blocks was offered for sale in the township of “New Sheffield” an area which substantially coincided with the central portion of the present Mittagong, being subdivided by the Fitzroy Iron Mining Company.\nThe area between the present-day Lyell and Pioneer Streets was called \"Nattai\" and was the postal township for many years before the name \"Mittagong\" was generally applied with the advent of the railway in 1867. In 1802, Barralier wrote of establishing his camp at a place called “Nattai” by the natives.\nAbout 1884 New Sheffield and Nattai united to form the present town of Mittagong.\n\nMittagong has been home to many industries, with iron being first smelted in the area. The Mittagong Coal Mining Company (Box Vale Colliery), Joadja Kerosene Shale, and the first supply of fresh milk and butter to Sydney by the Fresh Food & Ice Company all operated out of Mittagong in years gone by.\n\nThe transport of iron ore and smelted iron was made by steam train. Lake Alexandra was originally a water supply dam for railway engines hauling coal from the back of Mount Alexandra to the iron mines. It was drained in the 1890s when the land around it was given to Council by the Mittagong Land Company.\nThe presence of the ironstone was discovered when the deviation of the southbound road was being made through Mittagong in the early 1830s. Fifteen years elapsed before any attempt was made to work the iron deposit. In 1848 land was taken up and smelting commenced at the Fitzroy Iron Works in a small blast furnace that had been erected. The Sydney Morning Herald of 12 December 1848\nsaid the public had already witnessed the success of the mine by the specimens of manufactured articles exhibited in Sydney. On 2 February 1849\nit was stated that a quarry had been opened and stone prepared for buildings in course of erection. A brickfield had also commenced operations. Smelting was being carried on by means of a Cataline furnace and two shafts had been sunk. The party engaged in operating the mine was living in tents until buildings were erected. The mine was referred to at this time as the Fitz Roy iron mine, doubtless in honour of Sir Charles A. Fitz Roy, the Governor-General.\nAssociated with the iron ore deposit was the Chalybeate Spring, an iron-rich mineral spring that was a tourist attraction mainly during the second half of the 19th century and first few decades of C20th.\n\nThe town was dominated by trucks and in winter inundated with traffic carrying skiers' on their way to the Australian Alps until 1992 when the Hume Highway opened and bypassed Mittagong and all the towns and villages of the Southern Highlands. The highway bypass was first evaluated as having a slightly negative impact on Mittagong's economy for about a year after its opening, due to the loss of traffic-serving business. Expectations were re-evaluated as mildly positive in 1994 taking into account hard-to-quantify benefits such as the increased appeal of the town as a place to live.\n\nMittagong is also home to a prestigious girls secondary private boarding school, Frensham, which was opened by Winifred Mary West in 1913. The school is notable for its alumni which include Dr Catherine Hamlin and former Lord Mayor of Sydney, Lucy Turnbull.\n\nThe Mittagong Farm Homes for Boys, Mittagong TSB (training school boys), as late as the 1970s became known as Renwick and catered for boys and girls, and was situated along Bong Bong Road. Two homes were located along the Old Southern Road near Diamond Fields Road. An apology was issued by the NSW Government in 2013 for the cruel practices suffered by many of the children who spent time in this institution. The institutions alumni are now in the process of having one of the homes donated by the government as a museum and dedicated building to remind of the injustices perpetrated against children.\n\nIn March 2007, the \"Highlands Marketplace\" was opened. The complex is located on the Old Hume Highway towards Welby. The building has retail franchises such as Big W, Woolworths, Priceline and many others. It is built upon the original iron works site dating back to the 1800s. \nThere is a display of some of the original remains of this historical site in the carpark, interpretive signs recording the history. In November 2008, a new shopping complex was opened alongside the \"Highlands Marketplace\" known as the \"Highlands Hub\". It has franchises such as OfficeWorks, Best & Less, Subway, Supercheap, Godfreys and as at 2017 Service NSW being the RMS.\n\nMittagong has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2317437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317437", "title": "Synonymous substitution", "text": "Synonymous substitution\n\nA synonymous substitution (often called a \"silent\" substitution though they are not always silent) is the evolutionary substitution of one base for another in an exon of a gene coding for a protein, such that the produced amino acid sequence is not modified. This is possible because the genetic code is \"degenerate\", meaning that some amino acids are coded for by more than one three-base-pair codon; since some of the codons for a given amino acid differ by just one base pair from others coding for the same amino acid, a mutation that replaces the \"normal\" base by one of the alternatives will result in incorporation of the same amino acid into the growing polypeptide chain when the gene is translated. Synonymous substitutions and mutations affecting noncoding DNA are often considered silent mutations; however, it is not always the case that the mutation is silent. \n\nA synonymous mutation can affect transcription, splicing, mRNA transport, and translation, any of which could alter the resulting phenotype, rendering the synonymous mutation non-silent. The substrate specificity of the tRNA to the rare codon can affect the timing of translation, and in turn the co-translational folding of the protein. This is reflected in the codon usage bias that is observed in many species. A nonsynonymous substitution results in a change in amino acid that may be arbitrarily further classified as conservative (a change to an amino acid with similar physiochemical properties), semi-conservative (e.g. negatively to positively charged amino acid), or radical (vastly different amino acid).\n\nProtein translation involves a set of twenty amino acids. Each of these amino acids is coded for by a sequence of three DNA base pairs called a \"codon\". Because there are 64 possible codons, but only 20-22 encoded amino acids (in nature) and a stop signal (i.e. up to three codons that do not code for any amino acid and are known as stop codons, indicating that translation should stop), some amino acids are coded for by 2, 3, 4, or 6 different codons. For example, the codons TTT and TTC both code for the amino acid phenylalanine. This is often referred to as \"redundancy\" of the genetic code. There are two mechanisms for redundancy: several different transfer RNAs can deliver the same amino acid, or one tRNA can have a non-standard wobble base in position three of the anti-codon, which recognises more than one base in the codon.\n\nIn the above phenylalanine example, suppose that the base in position 3 of a TTT codon got substituted to a C, leaving the codon TTC. The amino acid at that position in the protein will remain a phenylalanine. Hence, the substitution is a synonymous one.\n\nWhen a synonymous or silent mutation occurs, the change is often assumed to be neutral, meaning that it does not affect the fitness of the individual carrying the new gene to survive and reproduce.\n\nSynonymous changes may not be neutral because certain codons are translated more efficiently (faster and/or more accurately) than others. For example, when a handful of synonymous changes in the fruit fly alcohol dehydrogenase gene were introduced, changing several codons to sub-optimal synonyms, production of the encoded enzyme was reduced and the adult flies showed lower ethanol tolerance.\nMany organisms, from bacteria through animals, display biased use of certain synonymous codons. Such codon usage bias may arise for different reasons, some selective, and some neutral. In \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" synonymous codon usage has been shown to influence mRNA folding stability, with mRNA encoding different protein secondary structure preferring different codons.\n\nAnother reason why synonymous changes are not always neutral is the fact that exon sequences close to exon-intron borders function as RNA splicing signals. When the splicing signal is destroyed by a synonymous mutation, the exon does not appear in the final protein. This results in a truncated protein. One study found that about a quarter of synonymous variations affecting exon 12 of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene result in that exon being skipped.\n\n"}

It was so named because Knight, Judith Merril, and James Blish lived in Milford, Pennsylvania when it was founded. It moved to the United Kingdom in 1972 and has run successfully ever since on an annual basis.\n\nJudith Merril, James Blish, and Damon Knight founded the Milford Writer's Conference in 1956. It is both a residential workshop and a writers' conference in which published science fiction writers convene over the course of a week to intensively critique stories and samples from novels (usually works in progress) and to workshop ideas on all aspects of SF writing. It is a peer-to-peer conference with no teachers or students.\n\nMilford and related entities like \"Science Fiction Forum\" presaged the creation of the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1965 and that decade's New Wave movement. In 1972, Blish set up the United Kingdom Milford SF Writers' Conference, which initially met in Milford on Sea, Hampshire. Since then it has been held in various locations, latterly Devon until 2001, York in 2002 and 2003, and (since 2004) at Trigonos Conference Centre in North Wales, usually in mid September.\n\nAn honorary committee is elected annually at the AGM held during the Milford week. The 2015 committee (elected 2014) comprised: Sue Thomason (Chair), Liz Williams (Secretary), Tina Anghelatos (Treasurer), Jacey Bedford (Vice-Chair, Website and Mailing Lists), Kari Sperring, and Karen Williams. Committee members are listed on the workshop's official web site.\n\nParticipants must have sold at least one science fiction story to qualify for attendance, and relative newcomers to publication are welcomed, though participants often have multiple novel and/or short story sales to their credit. Qualification details are quoted on the workshop's official website.\n\nWorkshop participants in the United States (pre-1972) included:\n\nMilford is the model for other peer-to-peer science fiction writer workshops, including the Turkey City Writer's Workshop, the Clarion Workshop and the Clarion West Writers Workshop. \n\nParticipants in the UK (in 1972 and afterward) have included:\n\nA full list of former Milford participants is listed on the workshop's official website.\n\nManuscripts are distributed beforehand. Everyone reads, critiques, and prepares before the formal workshop begins. Etiquette precludes participants from discussing the manuscripts beforehand either with the author or other members of the critique group. The participants sit round in a circle. The author whose work is being critiqued has to sit in silence through the first part in which each participant in turn is allowed an uninterrupted four minutes (timed) to deliver their critique. Then the author gets an uninterrupted right to reply. Following that a general discussion ensues. Constructive criticism is strongly encouraged. In the last few years it has become accepted for the critiqued manuscripts to be given back to the author complete with notes.\n\nThe so-called \"Milford method\" has been adopted by several writers' groups, including the Glasgow Science Fiction Writers Circle.\n\n"}
{"id": "2317480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317480", "title": "Tripod (photography)", "text": "Tripod (photography)\n\nIn photography, a tripod is used to stabilize and elevate a camera, a flash unit, or other photographic equipment. All photographic tripods have three legs and a mounting head to couple with a camera. The mounting head usually includes a thumbscrew that mates to a female threaded receptacle on the camera, as well as a mechanism to be able to rotate and tilt the camera when it is mounted on the tripod. Tripod legs are usually made to telescope, in order to save space when not in use. Tripods are usually made from aluminum, carbon fiber, steel, wood or plastic.\n\nTripods are used for both still and motion photography to prevent camera movement. They are necessary when slow-speed exposures are being made, or when lenses of extreme focal length are used, as any camera movement while the shutter is open will produce a blurred image. In the same vein, they reduce camera shake, and thus are instrumental in achieving maximum sharpness. A tripod is also helpful in achieving precise framing of the image, or when more than one image is being made of the same scene, for example when bracketing the exposure. Use of a tripod may also allow for a more thoughtful approach to photography. For all of these reasons, a tripod of some sort is often necessary for professional photography as well as certain video uses. Tripods are also used as an alternative to C-Stands to photographic accessories.\n\nFor maximum strength and stability, most photographic tripods are braced around a center post, with collapsible telescoping legs and a telescoping section at the top that can be raised or lowered. At the top of the tripod is the head, which includes the camera mount (usually a detachable plate with a thumbscrew to hold on to the camera), several joints to allow the camera to pan, rotate and tilt, and usually a handle to allow the operator to do so without jostling the camera. Some tripods also feature integrated remote controls to control a camcorder or camera, though these are usually proprietary to the company that built the camera. Materials used in the construction of tripod or monopod legs include metal (typically bare or painted aluminum), wood and carbon fiber-reinforced plastics, among others.\n\nPer ISO 1222:2010, the current tripod screw thread standard for attaching the camera calls for a 1/4-20 UNC or 3/8-16 UNC thread. Most consumer cameras are fitted with 1/4-20 UNC threads. Larger, professional cameras and lenses may be fitted with 3/8-16 UNC threads, plus a removable 1/4-20 UNC adapter, allowing them to be mounted on a tripod using either standard.\n\nHistorically, The Royal Photographic Society recommended the thread standard for attaching older cameras to tripods was 3/16-24 BSW (3/16 inch nominal diameter, 24 threads per inch), or 1/4-20 BSW for smaller cameras and 3/8-16 BSW for larger cameras and pan/tilt heads. In this application, the BSW and UNC thread profiles are similar enough that one can mount a modern camera on a legacy tripod and vice versa. The UNC threads are a 60-degree angle and flattened, whereas the BSW are a 55-degree angle and rounded crest. However, at least one English manufacturer uses No.1 B.A. (British Association) for its tripod mount thread.\n\nThere are several types of tripods. The least expensive, generally made of aluminum tubing and costing less than US$50, is used primarily for consumer still and video cameras; these generally come with an attached head and rubber feet. The head is very basic, and often not entirely suitable for smooth panning of a camcorder. A common feature, mostly designed for still cameras, allows the head to flip sideways 90 degrees to allow the camera to take pictures in portrait format rather than landscape. Often included is a small pin on the front of the mounting screw that is used to stabilize camcorders. This is not found on the more expensive photographic tripods.\n\nMore expensive professional tripods are sturdier, stronger, and usually come with no integrated head. The separate heads allow a tripod-head combination to be customized to the photographer's needs. There are expensive carbon fiber tripods, used for applications where the tripod needs to be lightweight. Many tripods, even some relatively inexpensive ones, also include leveling indicators for the legs of the tripod and the head.\n\nMany of the more expensive tripods have additional features, such as a reversible center post so that the camera may be mounted between the legs, allowing for shots from low positions, and legs that can open to several different angles.\nSmall \"tabletop\" tripods (sometimes called \"tablepods\") are also available, ranging from relatively flimsy models costing less than US$20, to professional models that can cost up to US$800 and can support up to 68 kg (150 lb). They are used in situations where a full sized tripod would be too bulky to carry. An alternative is a \"clamp-pod\", which is a ball head attached to a C-clamp.\n\nAnother technique involves forming a string triangle held taut around the two feet of the photographer and linked to the camera. This \"negative\" string \"tripod\" can stabilize the camera sufficiently to use a shutter speed three stops slower.\n\nThe head is the part of the tripod that attaches to the camera and allows it to be aimed. It may be integrated into the tripod, or a separate part. There are generally two different types of heads available.\nA ball head utilizes a ball joint to allow movement of all axes of rotation from a single point. Some ball heads also have a separate panoramic rotation axis on the base of the head. The head has two main parts, the \"ball\", which attaches to the camera and the \"socket\", which attaches to the tripod. The camera is attached to the ball via quick release plate, or a simple UNC 1/4\"-20 screw. The socket is where the ball rotates in, and also contains the controls for locking the ball. The socket has a slot on the side, to allow the camera to be rotated to the portrait orientation. Ball heads come in varying styles of complexity. Some have only one control for both ball and pan lock. While others have individual controls for the ball, pan, and also ball friction. Ball heads are used when a free-flow movement of the camera is needed. They are also more stable and can hold heavier loads, than pan-tilt heads. However, ball heads have the disadvantage that only one control is available to allow or prevent movement of all axes of rotation, so if the camera is tilted on one axis, there may be a risk of tilting on the other axes as well. When a movement of one, or two axes or rotation is needed, a pan-tilt head is used.\nThe pan-tilt head has separate axes and controls for tilting and panning, so that a certain axis can be controlled without risk of affecting the other axes. These heads come in two types, 2-way and 3-way. 2-way heads have 2 axes and controls, one for panoramic rotation, and one for front tilt. 3-way heads have 3 axes and controls, one for panoramic rotation, front tilt, and lateral tilt. The controls on these heads are usually handles that can be turned, to loosen or tighten the certain axis. This allows movement in one, a few, or none of the axes. When the movement of all axes of rotation is needed, a ball head is used. There are some pan-tilt heads that use gears, for precision control of each axis. This is helpful for some types of photography, such as macro photography.\n\nOther head types include the gimbal head, fluid head, gear head, alt-azimuth, and equatorial heads. Fluid heads and gear heads move very smoothly, avoiding the jerkiness caused by the stick-slip effect found in other types of tripod heads. Gimbal heads are single-axis heads used in order to allow a balanced movement for camera and lenses. This proves useful in wildlife photography as well as in any other case where very long and heavy telephoto lenses are adopted: a gimbal head rotates a lens around its center of gravity, thus allowing for easy and smooth manipulation while tracking moving subjects.\n\nIn place of or to supplement a tripod, some photographers use a one-legged telescoping stand called a monopod for convenience in setup and breakdown. A monopod requires the photographer to hold the camera in place, but because the monopod reduces the number of degrees of freedom of the camera, and also because the photographer no longer has to support the full weight of the camera, it can provide some of the same stabilization advantages as a tripod.\n\nFor low-angle shots particularly in cinematography, short tripods with fixed length legs and no center column may be used. The lowest of these is called a low hat, with a slightly higher version referred to as a hi hat.\n\nA travel tripod is one that has been designed to fit certain criteria including lightness and rigidity to give the photographer the freedom to travel and carry his/her tripod for extended periods. It must be small and light enough to be carried as hand baggage yet has enough strength to support a professional DSLR and fast telephoto lens. Typical specifications for a travel tripod legs would be: Weight (without head): 2 to 4 lbs (0.9 to 1.8 kg), Height (contracted): 12 to 20 inches (30 to 50 cm), Height (extended): - 60 to 70 inches (152 to 178 cm) and Max Load: 5 to 10 lbs (2.3 to 4.6 kg).\n\n"}

{"id": "2317493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317493", "title": "Ernst Nolte", "text": "Ernst Nolte\n\nErnst Nolte (11 January 1923 – 18 August 2016) was a German historian and philosopher. Nolte's major interest was the comparative studies of fascism and communism (cf. Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism). Originally trained in philosophy, he was professor emeritus of modern history at the Free University of Berlin, where he taught from 1973 until his 1991 retirement. He was previously a professor at the University of Marburg from 1965 to 1973. He was best known for his seminal work \"Fascism in Its Epoch\", which received widespread acclaim when it was published in 1963. Nolte was a prominent conservative academic from the early 1960s and was involved in many controversies related to the interpretation of the history of fascism and communism, including the \"Historikerstreit\" in the late 1980s. In recent years, Nolte focused on Islamism and \"Islamic fascism\".\n\nHe was the father of legal scholar Georg Nolte. Nolte received several prizes, including the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize and the Konrad Adenauer Prize.\n\nNolte was born in Witten, Westphalia, Germany to a Roman Catholic family. Nolte's parents were Heinrich Nolte, a school rector, and Anna (née Bruns) Nolte. According to Nolte in a March 28, 2003 interview with a French newspaper \"Eurozine\", his first encounter with communism occurred when he was 7 years old in 1930, when he read in a doctor's office a German translation of a Soviet children's book attacking the Catholic Church, which angered him.\n\nIn 1941, Nolte was excused from military service because of a deformed hand, and he studied Philosophy, Philology and Greek at the Universities of Münster, Berlin, and Freiburg. At Freiburg, Nolte was a student of Martin Heidegger, whom he acknowledges as a major influence. From 1944 onwards, Nolte was a close friend of the Heidegger family, and when in 1945 the professor feared arrest by the French, Nolte provided him with food and clothing for an attempted escape. Eugen Fink was another professor who influenced Nolte. After 1945 when Nolte received his BA in philosophy at Freiburg, he worked as a \"Gymnasium\" (high school) teacher. In 1952, he received a PhD in philosophy at Freiburg for his thesis \"Selbstentfremdung und Dialektik im deutschen Idealismus und bei Marx\" (\"Self Alienation and the Dialectic in German Idealism and Marx\"). Subsequently, Nolte began studies in \"Zeitgeschichte\" (contemporary history). He published his \"Habilitationsschrift\" awarded at the University of Cologne, \"Der Faschismus in seiner Epoche\", as a book in 1963. Between 1965 and 1973, Nolte worked as a professor at the University of Marburg, and from 1973 to 1991 at the Free University of Berlin.\n\nNolte married Annedore Mortier and they had a son, Georg Nolte, now a professor of international law at Humboldt University of Berlin.\n\nNolte came to notice with his 1963 book \"Der Faschismus in seiner Epoche\" (\"Fascism in Its Epoch\"; translated into English in 1965 as \"The Three Faces of Fascism\"), in which he argued that fascism arose as a form of resistance to and a reaction against modernity. Nolte's basic hypothesis and methodology were deeply rooted in the German \"philosophy of history\" tradition, a form of intellectual history which seeks to discover the \"metapolitical dimension\" of history. The \"metapolitical dimension\" is considered to be the history of grand ideas functioning as profound spiritual powers, which infuse all levels of society with their force. In Nolte's opinion, only those with training in philosophy can discover the \"metapolitical dimension\", and those who use normal historical methods miss this dimension of time. Using the methods of phenomenology, Nolte subjected German Nazism, Italian Fascism, and the French \"Action Française\" movements to a comparative analysis. Nolte's conclusion was that fascism was the great anti-movement: it was anti-liberal, anti-communist, anti-capitalist, and anti-bourgeois. In Nolte's view, fascism was the rejection of everything the modern world had to offer and was an essentially negative phenomenon. In a Hegelian dialectic, Nolte argued that the \"Action Française\" was the thesis, Italian Fascism was the antithesis, and German National Socialism the synthesis of the two earlier fascist movements.\n\nNolte argued that fascism functioned at three levels, namely in the world of politics as a form of opposition to Marxism, at the sociological level in opposition to bourgeois values, and in the \"metapolitical\" world as \"resistance to transcendence\" (\"transcendence\" in German can be translated as the \"spirit of modernity\"). Nolte defined the relationship between fascism and Marxism as such:\nNolte defined \"transcendence\" as a \"metapolitical\" force comprising two types of change. The first type, \"practical transcendence\", manifesting in material progress, technological change, political equality, and social advancement, comprises the process by which humanity liberates itself from traditional, hierarchical societies in favor of societies where all men and women are equal. The second type is \"theoretical transcendence\", the striving to go beyond what exists in the world towards a new future, eliminating traditional fetters imposed on the human mind by poverty, backwardness, ignorance, and class. Nolte himself defined \"theoretical transcendence\" as such:\n\nNolte cited the flight of Yuri Gagarin in 1961 as an example of “practical transcendence”, of how humanity was pressing forward in its technological development and rapidly acquiring powers traditionally thought to be only the province of the gods. Drawing upon the work of Max Weber, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Karl Marx, Nolte argued that the progress of both types of \"transcendence\" generates fear as the older world is swept aside by a new world, and that these fears led to fascism. Nolte wrote that:\nIn regard to the Holocaust, Nolte contended that because Adolf Hitler identified Jews with modernity, the basic thrust of Nazi policies towards Jews had always aimed at genocide. Nolte wrote that:\nNolte believed that, for Hitler, Jews represented \"the historical process itself\". Nolte argues that Hitler was \"logically consistent\" in seeking genocide of the Jews because Hitler detested modernity and identified Jews with the things that he most hated in the world. According to Nolte, \"In Hitler's extermination of the Jews, it was not a case of criminals committing criminal deeds, but of a uniquely monstrous action in which principles ran riot in a frenzy of self-destruction\". Nolte's theories about Nazi antisemitism as a rejection of modernity inspired the Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka to argue that National Socialism was an attack on \"the very roots of Western civilisation, its basic values and moral foundations\".\n\n\"The Three Faces of Fascism\" has been much praised as a seminal contribution to the creation of a theory of generic fascism based on a history of ideas, as opposed to the previous class-based analyses (especially the \"Rage of the Lower Middle Class\" thesis) that had characterized both Marxist and liberal interpretations of fascism. The German historian Jen-Werner Müller wrote that Nolte \"almost single-handedly\" brought down the totalitarianism paradigm in the 1960s and replaced it with the fascism paradigm. British historian Roger Griffin has written that although written in arcane and obscure language, Nolte's theory of fascism as a \"form of resistance to transcendence\" marked an important step in the understanding of fascism, and helped to spur scholars into new avenues of research on fascism.\n\nCriticism from the left, for example by Sir Ian Kershaw, centered on Nolte's focus on ideas as opposed to social and economic conditions as a motivating force for fascism, and that Nolte depended too much on fascist writings to support his thesis. Kershaw described Nolte's theory of fascism as \"resistance to transcendence\" as \"mystical and mystifying\". The American historian Fritz Stern wrote that \"The Three Faces of Fascism\" was an \"uneven book\" that was \"weak\" on \"Action Française\", \"strong\" on Fascism and \"masterly\" on National Socialism.\n\nLater in the 1970s, Nolte was to reject aspects of the theory of generic fascism that he had championed in \"The Three Faces of Fascism\" and instead moved closer to embracing totalitarian theory as a way of explaining both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. In Nolte's opinion, Nazi Germany was a \"mirror image\" of the Soviet Union and, with the exception of the \"technical detail\" of mass gassing, everything the Nazis did in Germany had already been done by the communists in Russia.\n\nAll of Nolte's historical work has been heavily influenced by German traditions of philosophy. In particular, Nolte seeks to find the essences of the \"metapolitical phenomenon\" of history, to discover the grand ideas which motivated all of history. As such, Nolte's work has been oriented towards the general as opposed to the specific attributes of a particular period of time. In his 1974 book \"Deutschland und der kalte Krieg\" (\"Germany and the Cold War\"), Nolte examined the partition of Germany after 1945, not by looking at the specific history of the Cold War and Germany, but rather by examining other divided states throughout history, treating the German partition as the supreme culmination of the \"metapolitical\" idea of partition caused by rival ideologies. In Nolte's view, the division of Germany made that nation the world's central battlefield between Soviet communism and American democracy, both of which were rival streams of the \"transcendence\" that had vanquished the Third Reich, the ultimate enemy of \"transcendence\". Nolte called the Cold War\n\nthe ideological and political conflict for the future structure of a united world, carried on for an indefinite period since 1917 (indeed anticipated as early as 1776) by several militant universalisms, each of which possesses at least one major state.\n\nNolte ended \"Deutschland und der kalte Krieg\" with a call for Germans to escape their fate as the world's foremost battleground for the rival ideologies of American democracy and Soviet communism by returning to the values of the Second \"Reich\". Likewise, Nolte called for the end of what he regarded as the unfair stigma attached to German nationalism because of National Socialism, and demanded that historians recognize that every country in the world had at some point in its history had \"its own Hitler era, with its monstrosities and sacrifices\".\n\nIn 1978, the American historian Charles S. Maier described Nolte's approach in \"Deutschland und der kalte Krieg\" as: This approach threatens to degenerate into the excessive valuation of abstraction as a surrogate for real transactions that Heine satirized and Marx dissected. How should we cope with a study that begins its discussion of the Cold War with Herodotus and the Greeks versus the Persians? ... Instead Nolte indulges in a potted history of Cold War events as they engulfed Asia and the Middle East as well as Europe, up through the Sino-Soviet dispute, the Vietnam War and SALT. The rationale is evidently that Germany can be interpreted only in the light of the world conflict, but the result verges on a centrifugal, coffee-table narrative.\n\nNolte has little regard for specific historical context in his treatment of the history of ideas, opting to seek what Carl Schmitt labeled the abstract \"final\" or \"ultimate\" ends of ideas, which for Nolte are the most extreme conclusions which can be drawn from an idea, representing the \"ultima terminus\" of the \"metapolitical\". For Nolte, ideas have a force of their own, and once a new idea has been introduced into the world, except for the total destruction of society, it cannot be ignored any more than the discovery of how to make fire or the invention of nuclear weapons can be ignored. In his 1974 book \"Deutschland und der kalte Krieg\" (\"Germany and the Cold War\"), Nolte wrote there was \"a worldwide reproach that the United States was after all putting into practice in Vietnam, nothing less than its basically crueler version of Auschwitz\".\n\nThe books \"Der Faschismus in seiner Epoche\", \"Deutschland und der kalte Krieg\", and \"Marxismus und industrielle Revolution\" (\"Marxism and the Industrial Revolution\") formed a trilogy in which Nolte seeks to explain what he considered to be the most important developments of the 20th century.\n\nNolte is best known for his role in launching the \"Historikerstreit\" (\"Historians' Dispute\") of 1986 and 1987. On 6 June 1986 Nolte published a \" feuilleton\" opinion piece entitled \"Vergangenheit, die nicht vergehen will: Eine Rede, die geschrieben, aber nicht mehr gehalten werden konnte\" (\"The Past That Will Not Pass: A Speech That Could Be Written but Not Delivered\") in the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\". His \"feuilleton\" was a distillation of ideas he had first introduced in lectures delivered in 1976 and in 1980. Earlier in 1986, Nolte had planned to deliver a speech before the Frankfurt Römerberg Conversations (an annual gathering of intellectuals), but he had claimed that the organizers of the event withdrew their invitation. In response, an editor and co-publisher of the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", Joachim Fest, allowed Nolte to have his speech printed as a \"feuilleton\" in his newspaper. One of Nolte's leading critics, British historian Richard J. Evans, claims that the organizers of the Römerberg Conversations did not withdraw their invitation, and that Nolte had just refused to attend.\n\nNolte began his \"feuilleton\" by remarking that it was necessary in his opinion to draw a \"line under the German past\". Nolte argued that the memory of the Nazi era was \"a bugaboo, as a past that in the process of establishing itself in the present or that is suspended above the present like an executioner's sword\". Nolte complained that excessive present-day interest in the Nazi period had the effect of drawing \"attention away from the pressing questions of the present—for example, the question of \"unborn life\" or the presence of genocide yesterday in Vietnam and today in Afghanistan\".\n\nThe crux of Nolte's thesis was presented when he wrote:\n\n\"It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds—with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing—that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s: mass deportations and shootings, torture, death camps, extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria, and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be \"enemies\". \nIt is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated. It is certain that the “White Terror” also committed terrible deeds, even though its program contained no analogy to the “extermination of the bourgeoisie”. Nonetheless, the following question must seem permissible, even unavoidable: Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “Asiatic” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “Asiatic” deed? Wasn’t the 'Gulag Archipelago' more original than Auschwitz? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual \"prius\" of the \"racial murder\" of National Socialism? Cannot Hitler's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had \"not\" forgotten the rat cage? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass?\n\nIn addition, Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the \"negative myth\" of the Third Reich that dominates contemporary perceptions. Nolte took the view that the principal problem of German history was this “negative myth” of the Third Reich, which cast the Nazi era as the \"ne plus ultra\" of evil.\n\nNolte contends that the great decisive event of the 20th century was the Russian Revolution of 1917, which plunged all of Europe into a long-simmering civil war that lasted until 1945. To Nolte, fascism, communism's twin, arose as a desperate response by the threatened middle classes of Europe to what Nolte has often called the “Bolshevik peril”. He suggests that if one wishes to understand the Holocaust, one should begin with the Industrial Revolution in Britain, and then understand the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.\n\nIn his 1987 book \"Der europäische Bürgerkrieg, 1917–1945\", Nolte argued in the interwar period, Germany was Europe's best hope for progress. Nolte wrote that \"if Europe was to succeed in establishing itself as a world power on an equal footing [with the United States and the Soviet Union], then Germany had to be the core of the new 'United States'\". Nolte claimed if Germany had to continue to abide by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, which had disarmed Germany, then Germany would have been destroyed by aggression from her neighbors sometime later in the 1930s, and with Germany's destruction, there would have been no hope for a \"United States of Europe\". The British historian Richard J. Evans accused Nolte of engaging in a geopolitical fantasy.\n\nThese views ignited a firestorm of controversy. Most historians in West Germany and virtually all historians outside Germany condemned Nolte's interpretation as factually incorrect, and as coming dangerously close to justifying the Holocaust. Many historians, such as Steven T. Katz, claimed that Nolte's “Age of Genocide” concept “trivialized” the Holocaust by reducing it to one of just many 20th century genocides. A common line of criticism was that Nazi crimes, above all the Holocaust, were singular and unique in their nature, and should not be loosely analogized to the crimes of others. Some historians such as Hans-Ulrich Wehler were most forceful in arguing that the sufferings of the “kulaks” deported during the Soviet “dekulakization” campaign of the early 1930s were in no way analogous to the suffering of the Jews deported in the early 1940s. Many were angered by Nolte's claim that \"the so-called annihilation of the Jews under the Third Reich was a reaction or a distorted copy and not a first act or an original\", with many wondering why Nolte spoke of the \"so-called annihilation of the Jews\" in describing the Holocaust. Some of the historians who denounced Nolte's views included Hans Mommsen, Jürgen Kocka, Detlev Peukert, Martin Broszat, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Michael Wolffsohn, Heinrich August Winkler, Wolfgang Mommsen, Karl Dietrich Bracher and Eberhard Jäckel. Much (though not all) of the criticism of Nolte came from historians who favored either the \"Sonderweg\" (\"Special Way\") and/or intentionalist/functionalist interpretations of German history.\n\nComing to Nolte's defence were the journalist Joachim Fest, the philosopher Helmut Fleischer, and the historians Klaus Hildebrand, Rainer Zitelmann, Hagen Schulze, Thomas Nipperdey and Imanuel Geiss. The last was unusual amongst Nolte's defenders as Geiss was normally identified with the left, while the rest of Nolte's supporters were seen as either on the right or holding centrist views. In response to Wehler's book, Geiss later published a book entitled \"Der Hysterikerstreit. Ein unpolemischer Essay\" (\"The Hysterical Dispute: An Unpolemical Essay\") in which he largely defended Nolte against Wehler's criticisms. Geiss wrote Nolte's critics had \"taken in isolation\" his statements and were guilty of being \"hasty readers\"\n\nIn particular, controversy centered on an argument of Nolte's 1985 essay “Between Myth and Revisionism” from the book \"Aspects of the Third Reich\", first published in German as \"\"Die negative Lebendigkeit des Dritten Reiches\"\" (\"\"The Negative Vitality of the Third Reich\"\") as an opinion piece in the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" on 24 July 1980, but which did not attract widespread attention until 1986 when Jürgen Habermas criticized the essay in a \"feuilleton\" piece. Nolte had delivered a lecture at the Siemens-Stiftung in 1980, and excerpts from his speech were published in the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" without attracting controversy. In his essay, Nolte argued that if the PLO were to destroy Israel, then the subsequent history written in the new Palestinian state would portray the former Israeli state in the blackest of colors with no references to any of the positive features of the defunct state. In Nolte's opinion, a similar situation of history written only by the victors exists in regards to the history of Nazi Germany. Many historians, such as British historian Richard J. Evans, have asserted that, based on this statement, Nolte appears to believe that the only reason why Nazism is regarded as evil is because Germany lost World War II, with no regard for the Holocaust. In a review which appeared in the \"Historische Zeitschrift\" journal on 2 April 1986 Klaus Hildebrand called Nolte's essay \"Between Myth and Revisionism\" “trailblazing”. In the same review Hildebrand argued Nolte had in a praiseworthy way sought:\n\n\"to incorporate in historicizing fashion that central element for the history of National Socialism and of the \"Third Reich\" of the annihilatory capacity of the ideology and of the regime, and to comprehend this totalitarian reality in the interrelated context of Russian and German history\".\n\nThe philosopher Jürgen Habermas in an article in the \"Die Zeit\" of 11 July 1986 strongly criticized Nolte, along with Andreas Hillgruber and Michael Stürmer, for engaging in what Habermas called “apologetic” history writing in regards to the Nazi era, and for seeking to “close Germany’s opening to the West” that in Habermas's view has existed since 1945.\n\nIn particular, Habermas took Nolte to task for suggesting a moral equivalence between the Holocaust and the Khmer Rouge genocide. In Habermas's opinion, since Cambodia was a backward, Third World agrarian state and Germany a modern, industrial state, there was no comparison between the two genocides.\n\nIn response to Habermas's essay, Klaus Hildebrand came to Nolte's defence. In an essay entitled \"The Age of Tyrants\", first published in the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" on July 31, 1986, he went on to praise Nolte for daring to open up new questions for research.\n\nNolte, for his part, started to write a series of letters to newspapers such as \"Die Zeit\" and \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" attacking his critics; for example, in a letter to \"Die Zeit\" on 1 August 1986, Nolte complained that his critic Jürgen Habermas was attempting to censor him for expressing his views, and accused Habermas of being the person responsible for blocking him from attending the Römerberg Conversations. In the same letter, Nolte described himself as the unnamed historian whose views on the reasons for the Holocaust had caused Saul Friedländer to walk out in disgust from a dinner party hosted by Nolte in Berlin in February or March 1986 that Habermas had alluded to an earlier letter\n\nResponding to the essay \"The Age of Tyrants: History and Politics\" by Klaus Hildebrand that defended Nolte, Habermas wrote:\n\n“In his essay Ernst Nolte discusses the “so-called” annihilation of the Jews (in H.W. Koch, ed. \"Aspects of the Third Reich\", London, 1985). Chaim Weizmann’s declaration in the beginning of September 1939 that the Jews of the world would fight on the side of Britain, “justified” – so opined Nolte – Hitler to treat the Jews as prisoners of war and intern them. Other objections aside, I cannot distinguish between the insinuation that world Jewry is a subject of international law and the usual anti-Semitic projections. And if it had at least stopped with deportation. All this does not stop Klaus Hildebrand in the \"Historische Zeitschrift\" from commending Nolte’s “pioneering essay”, because it “attempts to project exactly the seemingly unique aspects of the history of the Third Reich onto the backdrop of the European and global development\". Hildebrand is pleased that Nolte denies the singularity of the Nazi atrocities”.\n\nIn an essay entitled \"Encumbered Remembrance\", first published in the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" on August 29, 1986, Fest claimed that Nolte's argument that Nazi crimes were not singular was correct. Fest accused Habermas of \"academic dyslexia\" and \"character assassination\" in his attacks on Nolte.\n\nIn a letter to the editor of \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" published on September 6, 1986 Karl Dietrich Bracher accused both Habermas and Nolte of both \"...tabooing the concept of totalitarianism and inflating the formula of fascism\".\n\nThe historian Eberhard Jäckel, in an essay first published in the \"Die Zeit\" newspaper on September 12, 1986, argued that Nolte's theory was ahistorical on the grounds that Hitler held the Soviet Union in contempt and could not have felt threatened as Nolte claimed. Jäckel later described Nolte's methods as a \"game of confusion\", comprising dressing hypotheses up as questions and then attacking critics demanding evidence for his assertions as seeking to block one from asking questions.\n\nThe philosopher Helmut Fleischer, in an essay first published in the \"Nürnberger Zeitung\" newspaper on September 20, 1986, defended Nolte against Habermas on the grounds that Nolte was only seeking to place the Holocaust into a wider political context of the time. Fleischer accused Habermas of seeking to impose on Germans a left-wing moral understanding of the Nazi period and of creating a “moral” \"Sondergericht\" (Special Court). Fleischer argued that Nolte was only seeking the \"historicization\" of National Socialism that Martin Broszat had called for in a 1985 essay by trying to understand what caused National Socialism, with a special focus on the fear of communism.\n\nIn an essay first published in \"Die Zeit\" on September 26, 1986, the historian Jürgen Kocka argued against Nolte that the Holocaust was indeed a “singular” event because it had been committed by an advanced Western nation, and argued that Nolte's comparisons of the Holocaust with similar mass killings in Pol Pot's Cambodia, Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union, and Idi Amin's Uganda were invalid because of the backward nature of those societies.\n\nHagen Schulze, in an essay first published in \"Die Zeit\" on September 26, 1986, defended Nolte, together with Andreas Hillgruber, and argued that Habermas was acting from \"incorrect presuppositions\" in attacking Nolte and Hillgruber for denying the \"singularity\" of the Holocaust. Schulze argued that Habermas's attack on Nolte was flawed because he failed to provide any proof that the Holocaust was unique, and argued there were many \"aspects\" of the Holocaust that were \"common\" to other historical events.\n\nIn an essay first published in the \"Frankfurter Rundschau\" newspaper on November 14, 1986, Heinrich August Winkler wrote of Nolte's essay \"The Past That Will Not Pass\":\n\n“Those who read the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine\" all the way through to the culture section were able to read something under the title “The Past That Will Not Pass” that no German historian to date had noticed: that Auschwitz was only a copy of a Russian original – the Stalinist Gulag Archipelago. From a fear of the Bolsheviks’ Asiatic will to annihilate, Hitler himself committed an “Asiatic deed”. Was the annihilation of the Jews a kind of putative self-defence? That is what Nolte’s speculation amounts to.”\n\nThe political scientist Kurt Sontheimer, in an essay first published in the \"Rheinischer Merkur\" newspaper on November 21, 1986, accused Nolte and his supporters of attempting to create a new “national consciousness” intended to sever the Federal Republic's “intellectual and spiritual ties with the West”.\n\nThe German political scientist Richard Löwenthal noted that news of the Soviet kulak expulsions and the \"Holodomor\" did not reach Germany until 1941, so that Soviet atrocities could not possibly have influenced the Germans as Nolte claimed. In a letter to the editor of the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" on November 29, 1986, Löwenthal argued the case for a \"fundamental difference\" in mass murder between Germany and the Soviet Union, and against the \"equalizing\" of various crimes in the 20th century.\n\nThe German historian Horst Möller, in an essay first published in late 1986 in the \"Beiträge zur Konfliktforschung\" magazine, argued that Nolte was not attempting to \"excuse\" Nazi crimes by comparing them with the crimes of others, but was instead trying to explain Nazi war-crimes. Möller argued that Nolte was only attempting to explain \"irrational\" events rationally, and that the Nazis really did believe that they were confronted with a world Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy out to destroy Germany.\n\nIn an essay entitled \"The Nazi Reign – A Case of Normal Tyranny?\", first published in \"Die neue Gesellschaft\" magazine in late 1986, the political scientist Walter Euchner wrote that Nolte was wrong when he wrote of Hitler's alleged terror of the Austrian Social Democratic Party parades before 1914, arguing that Social Democratic parties in both Germany and Austria were fundamentally humane and pacifistic, instead of the terrorist-revolutionary entities Nolte alleged them to be.\n\nAnother area of controversy was Nolte's 1987 book \"Der europäische Bürgerkrieg\" (\"The European Civil War\") and some accompanying statements, by which Nolte appeared to flirt with Holocaust denial as a serious historical argument. In a letter to Otto Dov Kulka of 8 December 1986 Nolte criticized the work of French Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson on the ground that the Holocaust did in fact occur, but he went on to argue that Faurisson's work had admirable motives in the form of sympathy for Palestinians and opposition to Israel. In \"Der europäische Bürgerkrieg\", Nolte claimed that the intentions of Holocaust deniers are \"often honorable\", and that some of their claims are \"not evidently without foundation\". Kershaw has argued that Nolte was operating on the borderlines of Holocaust denial with his implied claim that the \"negative myth\" of the Third Reich was created by Jewish historians, his allegations of the domination of Holocaust scholarship by Jewish historians, and his statements that one should withhold judgment on Holocaust deniers, who Nolte insists are not exclusively Germans or fascists. In Kershaw's opinion, Nolte is attempting to imply that Holocaust deniers are perhaps on to something.\n\nIn \"Der europäische Bürgerkrieg\", Nolte put forward five different arguments as a way of criticizing the uniqueness of the \"Shoah\" thesis. These were as follows:\n\nThe British historian Richard J. Evans criticized Nolte, accusing him of taking too seriously the work of Holocaust deniers, whom Evans called cranks, not historians. Likewise, Evans charged that Nolte was guilty of making assertions unsupported by the evidence, such as claiming that SS massacres of Russian Jews were a form of counterinsurgency, or taking at face value the self-justifying claims of German generals who professed to be ignorant of the \"Shoah\".\n\nPerhaps the most extreme response to Nolte's thesis occurred on 9 February 1988, when his car was burned by leftist extremists in Berlin. Nolte called the case of arson \"terrorism\", and maintained that the attack was inspired by his opponents in the \"Historikerstreit\".\n\nCriticism from abroad came from Ian Kershaw, Gordon A. Craig, Richard J. Evans, Saul Friedländer, John Lukacs, Michael Marrus, and Timothy Mason. Mason wrote against Nolte, calling for the sort of theories of generic fascism that Nolte himself had once championed:\nAnson Rabinbach accused Nolte of attempting to erase German guilt for the Holocaust. Ian Kershaw wrote that Nolte was claiming that the Jews had essentially brought the Holocaust down on themselves, and were the authors of their own misfortunes in the \"Shoah\". Elie Wiesel called Nolte, together with Klaus Hildebrand, Andreas Hillgruber, and Michael Stürmer, one of the “four bandits” of German historiography.\n\nThe American historian Charles Maier rejected Nolte's claims regarding the moral equivalence of the Holocaust and Soviet terror on the grounds that while the latter was extremely brutal, it did not seek the physical annihilation of an entire people as state policy. The American historian Donald McKale blasted both Nolte and Andreas Hillgruber for their statements that the Allied strategic bombing offensives were just as much acts of genocide as the Holocaust, writing that that was just the sort of nonsense one would expect from Nazi apologists like Nolte and Hillgruber.\n\nIn a 1987 essay, the Austrian-born Israeli historian Walter Grab accused Nolte of engaging in an “apologia” for Nazi Germany. Grab called Nolte's claim that Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain was a \"Jewish declaration of war\" that justified the Germans \"interning\" European Jews a \"monstrous thesis\" that was not supported by the facts. Grab accused Nolte of ignoring the economic impoverishment and total lack of civil rights that the Jewish community in Germany lived under in 1939. Grab wrote that Nolte \"mocks\" the Jewish victims of National Socialism with his \"absolutely infamous\" statement that it was Weizmann with his letter that caused all of the Jewish death and suffering during the Holocaust.\n\nWriting in 1989, the British historian Richard J. Evans declared that:\n\nCiting \"Mein Kampf\", Evans argued that Hitler was an anti-Semite long before 1914 and that it was the SPD (the moderate left), not the Bolsheviks, whom Hitler regarded as his main enemies.\n\nNolte's opponents have expressed intense disagreement with his evidence for a Jewish \"war\" on Germany. They argue that Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain was written in his capacity as head of the World Zionist Organization, not on behalf of the entire Jewish people of the world, and that Nolte's views are based on the spurious idea that all Jews comprised a distinct \"nationality\" who took their marching orders from Jewish organizations.\nBecause of the views that he expressed during the \"Historikerstreit\", Nolte has often been accused of being a Nazi apologist and an anti-Semite. Nolte has always vehemently denied these charges, and has insisted that he is a neo-liberal in his politics. Nolte is by his own admission an intense German nationalist and his stated goal is to restore the Germans' sense of pride in their history that he feels has been missing since 1945. In a September 1987 interview, Nolte stated that the Germans were \"once the master race (\"Herrenvolk\"), now they are the \"guilty race\" (\"Sündervolk\"). The one is merely an inversion of the other\". Nolte's defenders have pointed to numerous statements on his part condemning Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. Nolte's critics have acknowledged these statements, but claim that Nolte's arguments can be construed as being sympathetic to the Nazis, such as his defence of the Commissar Order as a legitimate military order, his argument that the \"Einsatzgruppen\" massacres of Soviet Jews were a reasonable \"preventative security\" response to partisan attacks, his statements citing Viktor Suvorov that Operation Barbarossa was a \"preventive war\" forced on Hitler allegedly by an impending Soviet attack, his claim that too much scholarship on the Holocaust has been the work of \"biased\" Jewish historians, or his use of Nazi-era language such as his practice of referring to Red Army soldiers in World War II as “Asiatic hordes”.\n\nIn his 1991 book \"Geschichtsdenken im 20. Jahrhundert\" (\"Historical Thinking in the 20th Century\"), Nolte asserted that the 20th century had produced three “extraordinary states”, namely Germany, the Soviet Union, and Israel. He claimed that all three were “abnormal once”, but whereas the Soviet Union and Germany were now “normal” states, Israel was still “abnormal” and, in Nolte's view, in danger of becoming a fascist state that might commit genocide against the Palestinians.\n\nBetween 1995–97, Nolte debated with French historian François Furet in an exchange of letters on the relationship between fascism and communism. The debate had started with a footnote in Furet's book, \"Le Passé d'une illusion\" (\"The Passing of an Illusion\"), in which Furet acknowledged Nolte's merit of comparatively studying communism and Nazism, an almost forbidden practice in continental Europe. Both ideologies typify in a radical way the contradictions of liberalism. They follow a chronological sequence: Lenin predates Mussolini who in turn precedes Hitler. Furet noted that Nolte's theses went against the established notions of culpability and apprehension to criticize the idea of anti-fascism common in the West. This prompted an epistolary exchange between the two of them in which Furet argued that both ideologies were Totalitarian twins that shared the same origins, while Nolte maintained his views of a \"kausale Nexus\" (causal nexus) between fascism and communism, to which the former had been a response. After Furet's death, their correspondence was published as a book in France in 1998, entitled \"Fascisme et Communisme: échange épistolaire avec l'historien allemand Ernst Nolte prolongeant la Historikerstreit\" (\"Fascism and Communism: Epistolary Exchanges with the German Historian Ernst Nolte Extending the Historikerstreit\"). This was translated into English as \"Fascism and Communism\" in 2001. While pronouncing Stalin guilty of great crimes, Furet contended that, although the histories of fascism and communism were essential to European history, there were singular events associated with each movement which differentiated them; i.e., he did not feel there was a precise parallel, as Nolte suggested, between the Holocaust and the expulsions of the Kulaks.\n\nNolte often contributed \"Feuilleton\" (opinion pieces) to German newspapers such as \"Die Welt\" and the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\". He has often been described as one of the \"most brooding, German thinkers about history\". The historical consciousness and self-understanding of the Germans form a major theme of his essays. Nolte called the Federal Republic \"a state born of contemporary history, a product of catastrophe erected to overcome catastrophe\" In a \"Feuilleton\" piece published in \"Die Welt\" entitled “\"Auschwitz als Argument in der Geschichtstheorie\"” (\"Auschwitz as An Argument in Historical Theory\") on 2 January 1999, Nolte criticized his old enemy Richard J. Evans’s book \"In The Defence of History\", on the grounds that aspects of the Holocaust are open to revision, and that therefore Evans’s attacks on Nolte during the \"Historikerstreit\" were unwarranted. Specifically, citing the American political scientist Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, Nolte argued that the effectiveness of the gas chambers as killing instruments was exaggerated, that more Jews were killed by mass shooting than by mass gassing, that the number of people killed at Auschwitz was overestimated after 1945 (the Soviets initially exaggerated the death toll at 4 million where the consensus today is 1.1 million), that Binjamin Wilkomirski's memoir of Auschwitz was a forgery and that accordingly the history of the Holocaust is open to reinterpretation. In October 1999, Evans stated in response that he agreed with Nolte on these points, but argued that this form of argument was an attempt by Nolte to avoid responding to his criticism of him during the \"Historikerstreit\".\n\nOn 4 June 2000, Nolte was awarded the Konrad Adenauer Prize. The award attracted considerable public debate. It was presented to Nolte by Horst Möller, the Director of the \"Institut für Zeitgeschichte\" (Institute for Contemporary History), who praised Nolte’s scholarship while trying to steer clear of Nolte’s more controversial claims. In his acceptance speech, Nolte commented, \"We should leave behind the view that the opposite of National Socialist goals is always good and right\", while suggesting that excessive \"Jewish\" support for communism furnished the Nazis with \"rational reasons\" for their anti-Semitism.\n\nIn August 2000, Nolte wrote a favorable review in the \"Die Woche\" newspaper of Norman Finkelstein’s book \"The Holocaust Industry\", claiming Finkelstein’s book buttressed his claim that the memory of the Holocaust had been used by Jewish groups for their own reasons. Nolte’s positive review of \"The Holocaust Industry\" may have been related to Finkelstein’s endorsement in his book of Nolte’s demand, first made during the \"Historikerstreit\", for the “normalization” of the German past\n\nIn a 2004 book review of Richard Overy's monograph \"The Dictators\", the American historian Anne Applebaum argued that it was a valid intellectual exercise to compare the German and Soviet dictatorships, but complained that Nolte's arguments had needlessly discredited the comparative approach. In response, Paul Gottfried in 2005 defended Nolte against Applelbaum's charge of attempting to justify the Holocaust, contending that Nolte had merely argued that the Nazis had made a link in their own minds between Jews and communists, and that the Holocaust was their attempt to eliminate the most likely supporters of communism. In a June 2006 interview with the newspaper \"Die Welt\", echoing theories he first expressed in \"The Three Faces of Fascism\", Nolte identified Islamic fundamentalism as a \"third variant\", after communism and National Socialism, of \"the resistance to transcendence\", expressing regret that he will not have enough time to fully study Islamic fascism In the same interview, Nolte said that he could not forgive Augstein for calling Hillgruber a \"constitutional Nazi\" during the \"Historikerstreit\", and claimed that Wehler had helped to hound Hillgruber to his death in 1989. Nolte ended the interview by calling himself a philosopher, not a historian, and argued that the hostile reactions he often encountered from historians was due to his status as a philosopher who writes history.\n\nIn his 2005 book \"The Russian Roots of Nazism: White Émigrés and The Making of National Socialism\", the American historian Michael Kellogg argued that there were two extremes of thinking about the origins of National Socialism with Nolte arguing for a \"causal nexus\" between Communism in Russia and Nazism in Germany while the other extreme was represented by the American historian Daniel Goldhagen's theories about a unique German culture of \"eliminationist\" anti-Semitism Kellogg argued that his book represented an attempt at adopting a middle position between Nolte's and Goldhagen's positions, but that he leaned closer to Nolte's, contending that anti-Bolshevik and anti-Semitic Russian émigrés played a key and underappreciated role in the 1920s in the development of Nazi ideology with their influence on Nazi thinking about Judeo-Bolshevism being especially notable\n\nIn his 2006 book \"No Simple Victory\", the British historian Norman Davies lends Nolte's theories support by writing:\nDavies concluded that revelations made after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe after 1989–91 about Soviet crimes had discredited Nolte's critics.\n\nCourtois wrote the preface to the French edition of \"The European Civil War\", published in 2000.\n\n\n\nCzech\n\nFrench\n\nEnglish\nGerman\nItalian\nRussian\nSlovene\nBosnian\n\n"}

He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nMcDonald agreed to repeat the eighth grade, because his father felt the extra time would give him a chance to grow. He attended Roy High School in Roy, New Mexico, with an enrollment of around 150 students during his freshman year, where he played quarterback.\n\nAs a sophomore, he transferred to Highland High School in Albuquerque. As a senior, he averaged over 20 yards per carry in football and set the state scoring record with 157 points.\n\nHe also set the city scoring record in basketball, and won five gold medals in the state track meet (100, 220, low hurdles and 2 relays).\n\nMcDonald accepted a football scholarship from the University of Oklahoma, after the Oklahoma basketball coach Bruce Drake, saw him play in an All-star football game in Albuquerque and encouraged him to have his parent write a letter to the football head coach Bud Wilkinson. Based on Drake's recommendation, Wilkinson invited McDonald to the visit the school's campus and offered him a football scholarship soon thereafter.\n\nIn 1953, he spent the season on the freshman team. In 1954, he was a backup running back, registering 27 carries for 128 yards, 2 receptions for 28 yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\nIn 1955, he was named a starter at running back, tallying 114 carries for 715 yards (led the team), 16 rushing touchdowns (led the team), 7 receptions for 110 yards (second on the team) and one receiving touchdown (tied for the team lead). He also was a passer on the option play. He became the first player in school history to score a touchdown in every game of a season.\n\nIn 1956, he led the team with 119 carries for 853 yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, 12 receptions for 282 yards and 4 receiving touchdowns. At the end of the season he received the Maxwell Award as the nation's most outstanding college football player and finished third in the 1956 Heisman voting.\n\nHe excelled as a running back, never played in a losing game and was one of the key players during the school's 47-game winning streak. In 1985, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nMcDonald was also a member of the Delta Epsilon chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity while he was at Oklahoma.\n\nMcDonald was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 1957 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he was moved to wide receiver after he replaced an injured Bill Stribling in the ninth game of the season, making a 61-yard reception and a 25-yard receiving touchdown from quarterback Sonny Jurgensen.\n\nHe was a part of the team that won the 1960 NFL Championship against Vince Lombardi’s Green Bay Packers. In the contest he had a 35-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Norm Van Brocklin.\n\nIn 1961, he led the NFL in receiving yards (1,144) and touchdowns (13). Against the New York Giants, he had 7 receptions for 237 yards and 2 touchdowns, which still is a franchise single-game record.\n\nOn March, 20, 1964, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for Sam Baker, John Meyers, and Lynn Hoyem.\n\nIn 1964, he was switched from flanker to split end, because the Cowboys already had an accomplished flanker in Franklin Clarke and split end Billy Howton had just retired. Looking to improve the receiving corps to help the young quarterback Don Meredith, they also traded with the Pittsburgh Steelers to get Buddy Dial.\n\nIn his only season with the club, he registered 46 receptions for 612 yards (13.3 average) and 2 touchdowns (one of them against the Eagles). In 1965, with the emergence of rookie Bob Hayes he was traded to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for placekicker Danny Villanueva on May 14.\n\nMcDonald recorded a career-high 67 passes for 1,036 yards and 9 touchdowns in 1965. He was selected to his last Pro Bowl. In 1967 he was traded to the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a draft choice.\n\nOn September 10, 1968, he was waived following a season with 33 receptions for 436 yards and 4 touchdowns.\n\nIn 1968, McDonald was picked up by the Cleveland Browns for whom he caught 7 receptions for 113 yards and one touchdown. With the retirement of Raymond Berry the previous year, McDonald was technically the league's active leader in career receiving yards during the off-season but was surpassed in Game 1 by Don Maynard.\n\nHis last NFL game was the 1968 NFL Championship Game against the Baltimore Colts. On March 15, 1969, he announced his retirement from pro football.\n\nMcDonald was selected for six Pro Bowls, led the league in touchdown receptions twice (1958, 1960), and led the league in receiving yards once (1960). McDonald was the last non-kicker to play in the NFL without a facemask.\n\nHe finished his career with 495 receptions for 8,410 yards and 84 touchdowns, the second highest total of touchdown receptions in NFL history at the time. He also rushed for 22 yards and gained 1,459 yards and a touchdown returning punts and kickoffs on special teams, giving him 9,891 career all-purpose yards. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nFollowing the Eagles NFL Championship victory, McDonald wrote a biography: \"They Pay Me to Catch Footballs\", published by Chilton in 1962.\n\nHe also dabbled in art. He owned Tommy McDonald Enterprises, a studio that did portrait paintings and plaques, mainly of athletes. He did not paint the portraits himself, but had two painters who created them, although he signed them as being by McDonald (Enterprises). A portrait of Joe DiMaggio sold at auction for $4,000.\n\nHe died on September 24, 2018, at the age of 84. \"Tommy McDonald lived life like he played the game of football,\" Pro Football Hall of Fame president and CEO C. David Baker said in a statement. \"He was charismatic, passionate and had fun. He was such a character. Heaven is a happier place today.\n\n"}

They are selected for the team after a rigorous training program. They participate with the USSOCOM Parachute Team in addition to their regular duties, with training conducted during off duty time.\n\nThe USSOCOM is one of nine unified commands in the United States military's combatant command structure. The bulk of the command's 47,000 people are made up of Army Rangers and Special Forces (Green Berets); Navy Sea/Air/Land (SEAL) teams; Air Force combat controllers, pararescuemen and combat crew airmen; United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operators; and Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations forces.\n\nFormed in 1991, the USSOCOM Parachute Team represents the elite of the United States armed services, its Special Operations Forces (SOF). Team members are trained for a variety of combatant and humanitarian missions. One of the many techniques used for undetected infiltration into enemy zones is the dangerous and difficult military freefall (MFF) operation.\nThe team normally jumps from an altitude of 12,500 feet above ground level, freefalling approximately 2 miles, reaching speeds in excess of 120 miles per hour. This freefall can last up to one minute. During their freefall, the members of the team maneuver their bodies, like the flight surfaces of an aircraft, to form numerous aerial designs and formations in the sky. When the jumpers approach an altitude of 4,000 feet, they will break their formation and glide in different directions. As each team member reaches an altitude of 2,500 feet, they will begin deploying their parachutes. Once open, the members steer their parachutes and perform what is called \"stacking.\" Stacking enables the jumpers to form up in the air as a group and land one behind the other, with precision accuracy.\n\nThe USSOCOM Parachute Team modifies the military aspects of MFF operations and provides graphic displays of intricate maneuvers and precision canopy control techniques. Jumps by the team may include carrying a flag or passing a baton while descending in freefall, all while wearing burning smoke canisters attached to their boots to allow viewers to see them better.\n\nThe USSOCOM Parachute Team has appeared at numerous military and civilian airshows, sporting events at all levels (professional, college, high) and various patriotic, civic and school celebrations throughout the United States. Members of the USSOCOM Parachute Team have established themselves as showmen, traveling ambassadors, and SOF recruiters for the Department of Defense.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2317568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317568", "title": "Ssh-agent", "text": "Ssh-agent\n\nSecure Shell (SSH) is a protocol allowing secure remote login to a computer on a network using public-key cryptography. SSH client programs (such as codice_1 from OpenSSH) typically run for the duration of a remote login session and are configured to look for the user's private key in a file in the user's home directory (e.g., codice_2). For added security (for instance, against an attacker that can read any file on the local filesystem), it is common to store the private key in an encrypted form, where the encryption key is computed from a passphrase that the user has memorized. Because typing the passphrase can be tedious, many users would prefer to enter it just once per local login session. The most secure place to store the unencrypted key is in program memory, and in Unix-like operating systems, memory is normally associated with a process. A normal SSH client process cannot be used to store the unencrypted key because SSH client processes only last the duration of a remote login session. Therefore, users run a program called ssh-agent that runs beyond the duration of a local login session, stores unencrypted keys in memory, and communicates with SSH clients using a Unix domain socket.\n\ncodice_3 creates a socket and then checks the connections from codice_1. Everyone who is able to connect to this socket also has access to the codice_3. The permissions are set as in a usual Linux or Unix system. When the agent starts, it creates a new directory in codice_6 with restrictive permissions. The socket is located in this directory.\n\nThere is a procedure that may prevent malware from using the codice_3 socket. If the codice_8 option is set when the keys are imported into the codice_3, then the agent requests a confirmation from the user using the program specified by the codice_10 environment variable, whenever codice_1 tries to connect.\n\nOn the local system, it is important that the root user is trustworthy, because the root user can, amongst other things, just read the key file directly. On the remote system, if the codice_3 connection is forwarded, it is also important that the root user on the other end is trustworthy, because it can access the agent socket on the remote (though not the key, which stays local).\n\nThere are many different programs that perform the same functionality as the OpenSSH ssh-agent, some with very different user interfaces. PuTTY, for example, uses a graphical user interface in its bundled Pageant ssh-agent.\n\nThere are tools designed to provide key-agent functionality for both symmetric and asymmetric keys; these usually provide ssh-agent functionality as one of their application interfaces. Examples include GNOME Keyring and KWallet.\n\nSome monolithic SSH clients include the ability to remember SSH passphrases across sessions. Examples include: SecureCRT.\n\nOn the macOS operating system, ssh-agent has been integrated since Leopard, version 10.5 in 2007. Third-party open-source implementations of ssh-agent were available previously.\n\nOpenSSH-based client and server programs have been included in Windows 10 since version 1803. The SSH client and key agent are enabled and available by default and the SSH server is an optional Feature-on-Demand.\n\n"}

This presidency is held by a country, not a person; meetings are chaired by the minister from the country holding the presidency (depending on the topic, or \"configuration\"), except for the Foreign Affairs Council (one so-called \"configuration\" of the Council of the EU), which is usually chaired by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The Presidency of the Council of the European Union has been held by Croatia since 1 January 2020.\n\nAccording to protocol, it is the President of the Parliament who comes first, as it is listed first in the treaties. However, on the world stage, the principal representative of the EU is considered to be the President of the European Council, but the President of the European Commission, as head of the executive branch of the European Union, takes part in the G7 and other international summits as well.\n\nAll four offices have been described as the President of Europe, but none are analogous to the President of the United States (who is both head of state and head of government). Comparisons with other political system have attempted to explain the complex nature of the European institutions. As each institution has its own leader, it has been suggested that the terms \"Speaker\" of the European Parliament, \"Governor\" of the European Central Bank, \"Chairman\" of the Council of the European Union, \"President\" of the European Council and \"Prime Commissioner\" would give a clearer indication of their respective roles.\n\nDuring the height of the Commission President's powers in the late-1980s and 1990s, the Commission President was sometimes referred to as the Europe's Prime Minister and the role of the President is similar to that of a national Prime Minister chairing a cabinet. The formulation of titles is not without precedent in Europe; for comparison, the title for the Prime Minister of Spain in Spanish is the \"Presidente del Gobierno\" (\"President of the Government\"), not Prime Minister.\n\nThe Presidents of each institution are chosen in a slightly different way;\n\nWhilst distinct, each president is required to closely co-operate with one another in a complex political system. Under the ordinary legislative procedure of the European Union, the Commission proposes legislation with the Parliament and Council of the European Union coming to a co-decision on amendments and adoption of the law. The president of each of these organs is generally held responsible their functioning and direction.\n\nThe president of the European Council is considered the principal representative of the EU internationally and diplomatically. They are required to lead the Council, which works to set the EU's general political direction and promote compromise and consensus within the Council. They are appointed by the appropriate national leaders in the European Council.\n\nPrior to the Treaty of Lisbon, each member state in turn took the responsibilities of both the Presidency of the European Council and the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, with the representative to the European Council of the respective member state currently occupying the Presidency of the Council of the EU chairing meetings of the European Council. However, the title and office \"President of the European Council\" or any analogous position, did not exist prior to the Treaty of Lisbon, despite frequent misleading journalistic use of the shorthand tag \"EU President\" to refer to the leader of the member state occupying the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The misleading shorthand tag \"EU Presidency\" is still used by press today to refer to the member state holding the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union.\n\nThe president of the European Commission leads the Commission, the executive and cabinet of the European Union. The president, as part of this institution, is responsible for the political direction, logistics and implementation of European law and held accountable to both the European Parliament and Council of the European Union.\n\nThe role gives the holder the right to allocate portfolios to, dismiss and reshuffle European Commissioners and direct the Commission's civil service. The president is nominated by the European Council and appointed by the European Parliament. It is customary that the European Council uses the result of the last European elections to guide their nomination.\n\nThe president of the European Parliament ensures proper parliamentary procedure is followed and is responsible for representing the Parliament in both legal and diplomatic settings. The president must also give final assent to the EU budget.\n\n\n"}

He has also been the associate head coach at the University of Missouri. He served as interim head coach during the end of the 2006 season, but returned to his former position when new coach Mike Anderson was hired.\n\nBorn in Reidsville, North Carolina, Melvin Watkins attended Reidsville High School. Watkins started for the Reidsville High basketball team for from 1970 to 1973. As a senior, he was named team captain and, after helping the team earn the state championship, was named a 1973 high school All-American.\n\nWatkins played college basketball at University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where he was the point guard and team captain of the Charlotte 49ers' 1977 Final Four team. His #32 jersey was retired at his final home game in 1977. While at Charlotte, Watkins made a point to complete his education, earning a B.A. in Economics in 1977.\n\nWatkins was drafted in the fourth round of the 1977 NBA draft by the Buffalo Braves, but never played in the NBA.\n\nIn 1978, Watkins became an assistant coach for Charlotte's head coach Mike Pratt, and would continue as an assistant with Charlotte through eighteen seasons and three coaches: Pratt, Hal Wissel, and Jeff Mullins. When Mullins retired in 1996, Watkins was promoted and became the seventh head coach in school history and the first Charlotte alumnus to hold the position.\n\nIn his first season as head coach Watkins was named the Conference USA Ray Meyer Coach of the Year. He compiled an overall 42-20 record in his two seasons as head coach, bringing the 49ers to the NCAA Tournament twice, reaching the second round each year.\n\nAt the end of the 1998 season, Watkins accepted an offer to become the head coach at Texas A&M University, a school which had enjoyed only one winning season in the previous eight years. During the next six years, Watkins failed to live up to the success he enjoyed at Charlotte, achieving an unimpressive 60-112 record.\n\nIn one of the team's more controversial games of Watkins's A&M career, A&M beat Texas Tech 78-76 by sinking a basket at the buzzer. As soon as the basket was declared good and A&M given the victory, Watkins shepherded his team off of the court and onto the team bus, without allowing them time to change. After watching a replay, officials declared that the basket had come after the buzzer, but Watkins refused to allow his team back on the court to play overtime, and after thirty minutes of discussion, the officials finally declared that A&M had won. The team left so fast that they forgot to bring their radio crew, leaving Watkins to conduct the post-game news conference from a cell phone while he was on the team's bus.\n\nThe low point came in 2003–04, when the Aggies put up a 7-22 record, going 0-16 in the Big 12 Conference. Watkins was pressured into resigning during the Big 12 Tournament in 2004. Watkins would not coach for a team that beat Texas A&M again until 2013, when Arkansas snapped his own personal 26 game losing streak in games where Texas A&M was playing and he was coaching. He attributed much of the team's poor showing to the youth of the team's very talented recruits, which included freshman Acie Law IV and sophomores Marlon Pompey and Antoine Wright, and under his replacement Billy Gillispie, Watkins's players developed into a very strong team, earning an 8-8 conference record and a trip to the NIT in 2004–2005.\n\nDuring his tenure at Texas A&M, Watkins was noted for his outstanding recruiting, bringing eight National Top 100 recruits to the campus, including Antoine Wright the school's tenth all-time leading scorer. He also placed a large emphasis on academics, turning out 15 Academic All-Big 12 first or second team members during his six years, and ensuring that fourteen of the seventeen players who completed their eligibility at A&M went on to graduate (the remaining three players are playing professional basketball in overseas leagues).\n\nAfter tendering his resignation at Texas A&M, Watkins accepted the job as associate head coach at the University of Missouri on June 21, 2004.\n\nWatkins was named interim head coach at Mizzou following Quin Snyder's firing on February 10, 2006, with the Tigers at a record of 10-11 and suffering from a six-game losing streak. Watkins led the team to a 2-4 record during the remainder of their conference play. Following the hiring of new head coach Mike Anderson, Watkins resumed his title of associate head coach.\n\nOn April 6, 2011, Watkins and other fellow assistants followed Anderson to the University of Arkansas, where Anderson had become head coach.\n\nWatkins is married to the former Burrell Bryant. They have three children, Manuale, Marcus, and Keia. Marcus played for his father at both Texas A&M and the University of Missouri.\n\nWatkins is active in Habitat for Humanity and has served as the co-chair of a battered women's shelter.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Interim coach after Quin Snyder resigned; complete record for the 2005–06 season was 12–16 (5–11 Big 12).\n\n"}

Barry McKenzie was originally a character created by Barry Humphries for a cartoon strip in \"Private Eye\". It was the first Australian film to surpass one million dollars in Australian box office receipts. A sequel, \"Barry McKenzie Holds His Own\", was produced in 1974.\n\nBarry Humphries appears in several roles, including: a hippie, Barry McKenzie's psychiatrist Doctor de Lamphrey, and as Aunt Edna Everage (later Dame Edna Everage). Humphries would later achieve fame with the character of Dame Edna in the UK and US.\n\nThe film was produced by Phillip Adams.\n\nBarry 'Bazza' McKenzie (Barry Crocker) travels to England with his aunt Edna Everage (Barry Humphries) to advance his cultural education. Bazza is a young Aussie fond of beer, Bondi and beautiful 'sheilas'. He settles in Earls Court, where his old friend Curly (Paul Bertram) has a flat. He gets drunk, is ripped off, insulted by pretentious Englishmen and exploited by record producers, religious charlatans and a BBC television producer (Peter Cook). He reluctantly leaves England under the orders of his aunt, after exposing himself on television. His final words on the plane home are, \"I was just starting to like the Poms!\"\n\nBruce Beresford was living in London and knew Barry Humphries socially when he heard about government funding being given to Australian films.\nI said to Barry Humphries that we should do a script from the comic strip because they had money available to make films but it hadn't occurred to them that they had no one to make them. I said, \"I don't think they've thought about that but if we whip back to Australia with a script, with you starring in it and we're all set to go, we have a good chance of getting the money. There wouldn't be all that many going for it.\" And that's more or less what happened. \nThe film was entirely funded by the Australian Film Development Corporation. Shooting started in London in January 1972, with the unit moving to Australia in February. Local unions complained about the presence of British technicians in the crew, but a compromise was reached where Australian technicians joined the crew. Filming ended in March.\n\nPhillip Adams wanted to cast Paul Hogan as Curly but he turned down the role. \"I suspect he was concerned over his ability to work with professional actors,\" says Adams.\n\nPhillip Adams insisted on distributing the film himself initially. The film was very popular at the box office in Australia and London, and the production company repaid the government most of its money within three months of release. Bruce Beresford said in a 1999 interview: \nPersonally, it was a massive mistake for me to do it, a massive mistake, because the film was so badly received critically. Instead of getting me work, even though it was successful commercially, it put me out of work.\n\nBeresford went on to direct \"Barry McKenzie Holds His Own\" again to great commercial success in 1974, and then \"Breaker Morant\" (starring Edward Woodward) in 1980. However, in the 1999 interview, Beresford said that both Barry McKenzie films had been \"mistakes\":\nThat [\"Barry McKenzie Holds His Own\"] was an even bigger mistake. I couldn't find anything else to make because the films were so reviled critically that I thought that, with these two films, I'll never work again. Luckily Phillip Adams saved my life by offering me Don's Party. But that was a couple of years later. I thought the Barry McKenzie films were very funny but the reaction was so hostile that I realised very quickly that I had made a massive mistake.\n\nThis was the first Australian film to surpass $1 million at the national box office, and it led the Australian box office in 1972. The film recovered its $250,000 budget within a few months of release.\n\nThe film explores the cultural distance between Australian popular culture and the manners and mores of England, both nations presented in hyperbolically satirical manner. Barry is the extreme embodiment of \"Ockerism\" of the late fifties and mid-sixties Australia. Swearing, excessive drinking, vomiting, rowdiness and other crassness is glorified. The film also plays with the ideas of the era where the sixties cultural revolution had swept aside the \"certainties\" of classical education.\n\n"}

Her memoirs, entitled Torture and Resistance in Iran, document the events prior to and during her imprisonment. The memoirs provide not only a detailed personal account of Ashraf Dehghani's inner struggles while in prison, but also a description of the broader political struggles and objective conditions required for any revolutionary party to survive outside and inside of prison.\n\nIn 1973, she, together with Nahid Jalali, a member of MKO, organized a successful escape from prison. Ashraf Dehghani wrote her memoirs after escaping the Shah's prison in Iran, near the end of 1971. During her years of underground activity, at some point she worked directly with the OIPFG leader Hamid Ashraf. Later she fled abroad where she directed the international relations of the organization.\n\nIn 1979, she led a split away from OIPFG, and formed the Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas. The dispute with the leadership of the OIPFG stemmed from Ashraf's unwavering loyalty to Masoud Ahmadzadeh's theories. She also accused the leadership of deviating from Fadai's revolutionary traditions and inclination to compromise with the government. After a war between Kurds and Iranian Islamic Republic in 1981, a Kurdish revolutionary group of Ashraf Dehghani's group was formed. \n\n"}
{"id": "2317611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317611", "title": "Shini-tai", "text": "Shini-tai\n\nLiterally meaning 'dead body' or 'dying body,' the term is used to describe a wrestler who was not first to fall or touch outside the ring, but who had no chance of winning owing to the superior technique of his opponent (and his falling position). Whilst a relatively rare event, it is most often seen after close bouts in which one wrestler clearly had the advantage towards the end.\n\nFor example, consider the case where one wrestler overpowered his opponent forcing him to the ground with himself on top. If the overpowering wrestler put his hand down to protect against injury (so-called \"kabai-te\") before the wrestler underneath hit the ground, then the wrestler who was on top will still be judged the winner. This was seen in January 1972 when Kitanofuji was declared the winner over Takanohana despite putting his hand down first. Another example is where a strong wrestler pushes his opponent out of the ring with sufficient force that his opponent is still in the air at the time the winning rikishi steps outside because of his momentum. Alternatively, the wrestler who is on the offensive may lift his opponent and carry him out of the ring by \"tsuri-dashi\", and will still be declared the winner even if he puts his foot out first, as long as his opponent's feet are both in the air and he is moving forward.\n\nThe \"gyōji\" makes a decision as to the winner, which the judges, or any of the waiting wrestlers around the ring, are entitled to challenge. (It is very rare for a wrestler to intervene.) If there is a challenge the five judges step into the \"dohyō\" and have a \"mono-ii\" (talk about things) to discuss the match and the result.\n\nTheir options are to declare either a winner or a \"torinaoshi\" (replay). If declaring a winner, they can decide who fell out of the ring or touched the ground first, that one wrestler was a \"shinitai\" and therefore his opponent won, or declare one wrestler disqualified owing to use of an illegal technique.\n\nTheir explanation is usually that the winning wrestler used a specific technique to overpower his opponent and was in clear control of the match. They grant him the victory regardless of whether or not he touched the ground first.\n\nBy extension, this word means as \"lame duck\" in japanese.\n"}
{"id": "2317624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317624", "title": "Yoshinari Ogawa", "text": "Yoshinari Ogawa\n\nYoshinari Ogawa debuted in All Japan Pro Wrestling in 1985, working on the undercard, until joining Genichiro Tenryu's group Revolution, which helped him elevate higher on the card. He remained in the group until it disbanded in 1990 upon Tenryu's abrupt departure from AJPW.\n\nAfter Tenryu left, Ogawa became one of the top stars in AJPW's junior heavyweight division in the 1990s, winning the junior heavyweight championship three times. He also reigned as tag team champion with his mentor, Mitsuharu Misawa. Ogawa left AJPW for Misawa's newly formed Pro Wrestling Noah in 2000, where he continued his tag team with Misawa, even winning the GHC Tag Team Championship becoming the second ever champions by defeating the team of Scorpio and Vader, holding the titles for nine days before losing the titles to Takao Omori and Yoshihiro Takayama. On April 7, 2002 he scored a huge upset, beating Jun Akiyama very quickly to become the GHC Heavyweight Champion. Ogawa held the title for 153 days, defending his championship twice against Akira Taue and Takeshi Rikio, before ultimately losing it to Takayama on September 7, 2002. On January 10, 2004, Ogawa and Misawa won the GHC Tag Team Championship for a second time, this time defeating Hiroshi Tanahashi and Yuji Nagata at the Great Voyage 2004 show. The team held the championship for a then-record 379 days while defending the belts seven times, another record at the time. They lost the championships to the team of Scorpio and Doug Williams on January 23, 2005. \n\nOgawa became a mainstay in the junior heavyweight division forming a partnership with Zack Sabre Jr. starting in 2013 as the pair joined together to take part in the NTV G+ Cup Junior Heavyweight Tag League for the vacant GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. The team came in second place in their block losing to eventual block and league winners Jyushin Thunder Liger and Tiger Mask IV on the final day. However, the team defeated Liger and Tiger Mask on December 7, 2013, at 'Great Voyage in Tokyo Vol. 2' to become the tag team champions for the first time. The pair defended their titles for the first, and only, time on March 8, 2014, defeating Kenoh and Hajime Ohara at 'Great Voyage in Tokyo' show. The team lost the titles on March 21, 2014, to the team of Atsushi Kotoge and Taiji Ishimori, but Ogawa and Sabre became two-time champions less than a month later by defeating Kotoge and Ishimori for the championships. Yet again, on July 5, 2014, after just one defense over Hiro Tonai and Shiori Asahi which occurred on May 3, Ogawa and Sabre lost the titles to Kotoge and Ishimori at 'Great Voyage in Tokyo Vol.2'. \n\nThe pair entered the 2014 NTV G+ Junior Tag League and finished last in their four team block with four points. On May 10, 2015, Ogawa and Sabre received a title match against the champions El Desperado and Taka Michinoku at Great Voyage in Yokohama. This match was a losing effort from the team and Ogawa, in the summer of 2015, took part in his first singles tournament since 2008, the Global Junior Heavyweight League. Ogawa finished fifth in the block of seven with six points and victories over Desperado, Hitoshi Kumano, and Sho Tanaka. Ogawa and Sabre took part in their third straight NTV G+ Junior Tag League and finished second, again losing to the eventual block winners, Desperado and Michinoku, on the final day of the league. This match was their final match as a team and on November 30, 2015, Ogawa's six man team of Hitoshi Kumano and Muhammad Yone defeated Sabre's team of Genba Hirayanagi and Captain Noah with Ogawa scoring the decision over Sabre in what was Sabre's final match in Pro Wrestling Noah. \n\nOgawa, alongside several Noah company-mates, took part in the first two New Japan Pro-Wrestling 'Lion's Gate Project' shows where he defeated Jay White on the first show on February 25, 2016, then defeated David Finlay on the second show which took place on May 19. Ogawa took part in the qualifying for the 2016 Super J-Cup defeating Hitoshi Kumano in his first qualifier but losing to Taiji Ishimori in the final of his qualifying region.\n\nIn 2019, He later won the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship with Kotaro Suzuki and formed a stable named Stinger later joined by Atsushi Kotoge and Chris Ridgeway.\n\nIn 4th January 2020 Ogawa defeated Hayata to became GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship for first time in his career, thereby completing his win of NOAH's four major GHC titles and becoming the fourth man to do so after Naomichi Marufuji, KENTA and Takashi Sugiura.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2317680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317680", "title": "Pina Bausch", "text": "Pina Bausch\n\nPhilippine \"Pina\" Bausch (27 July 1940 – 30 June 2009) was a German dancer and choreographer who, with a blend of movement, sound, and prominent stage sets, and with performers during the development of a piece (a style now known as ), became an influence in the field of modern dance from the 1970s on. She created the company Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch, which performs internationally.\n\nBausch was born in Solingen, the daughter of August and Anita Bausch, who owned a restaurant with guest rooms which is where she was born. The restaurant provided Pina with a venue to start performing at a very young age. She would perform for all of the guests in the hotel and occasionally go into their rooms and dance while they were trying to read the newspaper. It was then that her parents saw her potential.\n\nPina was accepted into Kurt Jooss's the Folkwangschule at age of 14.\n\nAfter graduation in 1959, Bausch left Germany with a scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service to continue her studies at the Juilliard School in New York City in 1960, where her teachers included Antony Tudor, José Limón, Alfredo Corvino, and Paul Taylor. Bausch was soon performing with Tudor at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet Company, and with Paul Taylor at New American Ballet. When, in 1960, Taylor was invited to premiere a new work named \"Tablet\" in Spoleto, Italy, he took Bausch with him. In New York Bausch also performed with the Paul Sanasardo and Donya Feuer Dance Company and collaborated on two pieces with them in 1961. It was in New York City that Pina stated, \"New York is like a jungle but at the same time it gives you a feeling of total freedom. In these two years, I have found myself.\"\n\nIn 1962, Bausch joined Jooss' new (Folkwang Ballet) as a soloist and assisted Jooss on many of the pieces. In 1968, she choreographed her first piece, (Fragments), to music by Béla Bartók. In 1969, she succeeded Jooss as artistic director of the company.\n\nIn 1973, Bausch started as artistic director of the Wuppertal Opera ballet, as the , run as an independent company. The company has a large repertoire of original pieces, and regularly tours throughout the world from its home base of the Opernhaus Wuppertal. It was renamed later: Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch.\n\nHer best-known dance-theatre works include the melancholic \"Café Müller\" (1985), in which dancers stumble around the stage crashing into tables and chairs. Bausch had most of the dancers perform this piece with their eyes closed. The thrilling (\"The Rite of Spring\") (1975) required the stage to be completely covered with soil. She stated: \"It is almost unimportant whether a work finds an understanding audience. One has to do it because one believes that it is the right thing to do. We are not only here to please, we cannot help challenging the spectator.\"\n\nOne of the themes in her work was relationships. She had a very specific process in which she went about creating emotions. \"Improvisation and the memory of [the dancer's] own experiences ... she asks questions—about parents, childhood, feelings in specific situations, the use of objects, dislikes, injuries, aspirations. From the answers develop gestures, sentences, dialogues, little scenes.\" The dancer is free to choose any expressive mode, whether it is verbal or physical when answering these questions. It is with this freedom that the dancer feels secure in going deep within themselves. When talking about her process she stated, \"There is no book. There is no set. There is no music. There is only life and us. It's absolutely frightening to do a work when you have nothing to hold on to.\" She stated, \"In the end, it's composition. What you do with things. There's nothing there to start with. There are only answers: sentences, little scenes someone's shown you. It's all separate to start with. Then at a certain point I'll take something which I think is right and join it to something else. This with that, that with something else. One thing with various other things. And by the time I've found the next thing is right, then the little thing I had is already a lot bigger.\"\nMale-female interaction is a theme found throughout her work, which has been an inspiration for—and reached a wider audience through—the movie \"Talk to Her\", directed by Pedro Almodóvar. Her pieces are constructed of short units of dialogue and action, often of a surreal nature. Repetition is an important structuring device. She stated: \"\"Repetition is not repetition,\" ... The same action makes you feel something completely different by the end.\" Her large multi-media productions often involve elaborate sets and eclectic music. In , half of the stage is taken up by a giant, rocky hill, and the score includes everything from Portuguese music to k.d. lang.\n\nIn 1983, she played the role of La Principessa Lherimia in Federico Fellini's film \"And the Ship Sails On\". The Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch made its American debut in Los Angeles as the opening performance of the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival.\n\nIn 2009, Bausch started to collaborate with film director Wim Wenders on a 3D documentary, \"Pina\". The film premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in 2011.\n\nBausch was married to Dutch-born Rolf Borzik, a set and costume designer who died of leukaemia in 1980. Later that year, she met Ronald Kay, and in 1981 they had a son, Rolf-Salomon T.\n\nAmong the honours awarded to Bausch are the UK's Laurence Olivier Award and Japan's Kyoto Prize. She was awarded the Deutscher Tanzpreis in 1995. In 1999, she was the recipient of the Europe Theatre Prize. In 2008, the city of Frankfurt am Main awarded her its prestigious Goethe Prize. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2009.\n\nWorks by Bausch were staged in June and July 2012 as a highlight of the Cultural Olympiad preceding the Olympic Games 2012 in London. The works were created when Bausch was invited to visit and stay in 10 global locations – in India, Brazil, Palermo, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Budapest, Istanbul, Santiago, Rome, and Japan – between 1986 and 2009. Seven of the works have not been seen in the UK.\n\nBausch died on 30 June 2009 in Wuppertal, North Rhine Westphalia, Germany at the age of 68 of an unstated form of cancer attributable to smoking, five days after diagnosis and two days before shooting was scheduled to begin for the long-planned Wim Wenders documentary. She is survived by her son Salomon.\n\nThe same year, choreographer and experimental theatre-maker Dimitris Papaioannou created a piece called \"Nowhere\" to inaugurate the renovated Main Stage of the Greek National Theatre in Athens. The show's central and most prolific scene was dedicated to the memory of Pina Bausch and involved performers linking arms and stripping naked a man and woman.\n\nWenders' documentary, \"Pina,\" was released in late 2011 in the United States, and is dedicated to her memory.\n\nBausch's style has influenced performers such as David Bowie, who designed part of his 1987 Glass Spider Tour with Bausch in mind. For the tour, Bowie \"wanted to bridge together some kind of symbolist theatre and modern dance\" and used Bausch's early work as a guideline.\n\nPromotional trailers for the third season of \"\" included a clip for the episode \"Detention\" and were likely influenced by Bausch's work . Stills from the performance and the episode show a group of women seemingly defying gravity as they cling to the walls high above the ground, toes pointed down and hands pressed above them. The photo of Bausch's performance was previously released on Reddit as well as Twitter with the implication that it was from a Russian mental institution, but its source was quickly identified.\n\nThe following table shows works since 1973. Several of Pina Bausch's works were announced as because she chose a title late in the development of a work. The typical subtitle from 1978 was (A piece by Pina Bausch). The translations are given as on the website of Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch. Some of the German titles are ambiguous. \"Kontakthof\" is composed of Kontakt (\"contact\") and Hof (\"court, courtyard\"), resulting in \"courtyard of contact,\" which is also a technical term for an area in some brothels where the first contact with prostitutes is possible. \"Ich bring dich um die Ecke,\" literally \"I'll take you around the corner,\" can mean \"I'll accompany you around the corner\" but also colloquially \"I'll kill you.\" \"Ahnen\" can mean \"ancestors,\" but also (as a verb) \"to foresee\", \"bode\", \"suspect.\"\n\nThe details about the music for the works until 1986 follow a book by Raimund Hoghe who was dramaturg in Wuppertal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Cedar Point had planned to name the ride Banshee, but due to negative publicity following the announcement, the name was later changed to Mantis.\n\nIn September 2014, Cedar Point announced the pending closure of Mantis, scheduled for the following month. The park later revealed that Mantis would not be removed but would be transformed into a floorless roller coaster design for the 2015 season. It reopened as Rougarou on May 9, 2015.\n\nOn September 8, 1995, Cedar Point announced plans to build a new roller coaster, which would open as the tallest, fastest, and longest stand-up roller coaster in the world. The ride was to be named Banshee after the mythical wailing ghost in Irish folklore. In the days following the announcement, there was some negative reaction from the public regarding the term Banshee, which in the dictionary is described as a female spirit that warns of an impending family death. On November 14, 1995, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name \"Mantis\", which later became the ride's official name. As a result of the name change, its logo was also changed to resemble a mantis. The discarded name would later be reused for an inverted roller coaster that opened at Kings Island in 2014.\n\nConstruction on the new roller coaster began in the off season and was completed on January 9, 1996. More than 20% of the track was built over water. Cedar Point held a \"Media Day\" for Mantis on May 9, 1996, and the ride officially opened to the public on May 11, 1996.\n\nOn September 2, 2014, after weeks of leaking clues that a major announcement was forthcoming, Cedar Point released a statement that Mantis would close on October 19, 2014. According to the park, the roller coaster had given over 22 million rides since its debut. However, Cedar Point revealed on September 18, 2014, that Mantis would not be removed, but instead would be converted into a floorless roller coaster complete with new trains, new colors, and a new theme. It reopened as Rougarou, the name of a legendary creature in French folklore that draws comparisons to the mythical werewolf, on May 9, 2015.\n\nThe ride starts with a slight left-turn and then an ascent up the lift hill. Once the train reaches the top and passes through the pre-drop, the track makes a 180 degree right turn, leading into the first drop. Riders then drop at a 52 degree angle, reaching a top speed of and enter a vertical loop. This is immediately followed by a dive loop, a non-inverting overbanked turn directly above the station, and an left-leaning inclined loop. From here, the track makes an uphill right turn into the mid-course brake run. Off the midcourse brakes, the track drops into a Corkscrew, and finish off with a figure-eight turn. The train then enters the final brake run, and then makes a right turn, passing through the transfer track before returning to the station.\n\nAs Mantis, the ride operated with two steel and fiberglass trains. Each train had eight cars with four seats in a single row supporting a total capacity of 32 riders. Mantis originally operated with three trains but the park later reduced operation to two trains due to the trains \"stacking\" on the brake run. Riders were secured by an over-the-shoulder harness. Although Mantis was a stand-up roller coaster, there was a small bicycle seat riders could lean on.\n\nFor its transition to Rougarou, the ride received three new floorless trains which allows riders' legs to dangle freely above the track, as there is no floor between rows. Each has the same 32-rider configuration as the previous trains on Mantis. Riders are also secured by an over-the-shoulder harness with an interlocking seatbelt.\n\nMantis set several records among stand-up roller coasters when it opened in 1996. It set the world record for height at , speed at , and length at . It was also the first stand-up roller coaster to feature a dive loop and an inclined loop.\n\n"}

They are native to the Caribbean, western Mexico through Central America to northern South America, with some species along the Andes down to southern Peru, and a concentration of species in northeastern Brazil. \n\nThe first species was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, as \"Cactus melocactus\". When the genus was separated from \"Cactus\", the pre-Linnaean name \"Melocactus\" was used. Acting on the principle of priority, in 1922 Nathaniel Britton and Joseph Rose resurrected Linnaeus' \"Cactus\". However, the 1905 Vienna botanical congress had already rejected the name \"Cactus\", so this name was not available, and \"Melocactus\" is the correct genus name.\n\nMature plants are easily recognizable by their cephalium, a wool- and bristle-coated structure at the apex of the plant, containing a mass of areoles from which the small flowers grow. Since the red, wool-coated cephalium of the plant is similar to the Fez hat of the Turkish male citizens during late Ottoman Empire, one name for the plant is Turk's cap cactus.\n\nThe fruits of \"Melocactus\" are pink and resemble the shape of pepper fruits. The fruits of this genus are edible, and in the wild they are frequently dispersed by lizards and birds.\n\n, \"Plants of the World Online\" accepted the following species:\n"}

The word has origin in the Sanskrit word of \"Kāmati\" (i.e. Kaam + Maati) meaning \"people who work in soil\" or do farming or cultivate land. \"Camotim\" was used in the erstwhile Portuguese territory of Goa but has given way to \"Kāmat\" today. \"Camat\" word is still in use in Indonesia which was a Portuguese colony at some point of time in the history. In Indonesia \"Camat\" means administrative and political head of the sub-district or taluk. Taluk may be said as kecamatan (spelled as ke-chamatan).

{"id": "2317721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317721", "title": "Cap gun", "text": "Cap gun\n\nA cap gun, cap pistol, or cap rifle is a toy gun that creates a loud sound simulating a gunshot and a puff of smoke when a small percussion cap is exploded. Cap guns were originally made of cast iron, but after World War II were made of zinc alloy, and most newer models are made of plastic.\n\nCap guns get their name from the small discs of shock-sensitive explosive and dangerous compounds (roughly in diameter) that provide the noise and smoke, effectively the same as the Maynard tape primer and percussion caps used in real firearms of the mid to late 1800s but usually smaller and made from cheap plastic or paper. Some are arranged in plastic rings of eight or twelve. There are also single caps, roll caps (of 50 to 500), disk caps, and cap strips all of which are actually extremely small versions of percussion fireworks. Armstrong's mixture is often used today as the explosive, but previously the tiny powder charge was a simple mixture of potassium perchlorate, sulfur, and antimony sulfide sandwiched between two paper layers which hold in the gases long enough to give a sound report when the cap is struck.\n\nReal guns that used caps first appeared around the Civil War era, when faster firing weapons were needed. After the demand for caps, firearms companies experimented with toy cap guns modeled after real percussion cap guns.\n\nCap guns became especially popular when the heroes of cinema and television rode through the West, ridding the territories of villains. Many cap guns were named after or endorsed by leading matinee idols like Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Hopalong Cassidy, The Lone Ranger, Tonto, Dale Evans, Marshal Matt Dillon, or any of countless others.\nThe \"Golden Age\" of cap guns was roughly a 20-year period following World War II when television became popular and such companies as Nichols, Hubley, Kenton, Kilgore, Wyandotte, Classy, Mattel, Actoy, Esquire, George Schmidt, and Stevens in the USA and companies like Lone Star Toys in the UK made millions of cap guns in various versions. While many had their names patterned after a hero or heroine, many cap guns were also named with western-sounding names, like: \"Stallion 45\", \"Pony\", \"Mustang\", \"Pioneer\", \"Cowboy\", \"Texan\", \"Colt 45\", \"Rodeo\", and such.\n\nChildren all over the world emulated their heroes by collecting and playing with these toy guns. However, when the Western television shows began to fade away and the heroes retired, the cap gun continued to be produced in military and secret agent modes until the popularity of the tie-in toy guns also diminished, and eventually all of the famous cap gun manufacturers either sold out to other toy companies or started manufacturing other types of toys.\n\nThere were many types of cap guns, including guns from small Derringers to larger rifles, and even working miniatures of most of them. One of the last famous ones to sell widely was a toy rifle named after the television show, \"The Rifleman\", which aired from 1958 through early 1963. Other shows lasted longer, such as Gunsmoke (which had 20 seasons lasting through 1975), but these did not have as much 'kid-appeal' as the earlier shows, and the sales of toy cap guns began to decline.\n\nThe pistols were generally offered in 3 styles: the semi-automatic, the revolver (which actually had a revolving cylinder carrying a disk of caps), and the mock-revolver which looked like a regular revolver, but opened to load a roll of caps. Almost all of the early models used either roll caps or circular disks of caps, but in 1950 Nichols Industries came out with a large model called the Stallion 45, which had a revolving cylinder into which individual bullets were loaded, which each had two parts. The circular cap was placed into the 2-piece bullet and then when the gun was loaded and fired, it seemed more realistic. Eventually several companies used this idea and a few years later Nichols invented a plastic bullet that was snapped into a hollowed-out version of the regular 2-piece bullet with a compression spring inside. When the gun was fired, the spring pressure \"shot\" the plastic pellet out of the end of the barrel. Eventually Mattel also came out with a similar model called \"Shootin' Shells.\"\n\nMattel produced an automatic firing cap weapon styled after the Thompson submachine gun. Pulling back on a slide, which simulated the charging handle of the real Thompson, prepared the gun for firing by tensioning a spring. When the trigger was pulled the spring power would drive the mechanism, firing a series of up to ten caps from a sprocket-fed roll. It was made initially for a Dick Tracy line of toys, then camouflaged for a Green Beret Guerilla Fighter line of weapons, then restyled again as a tie-in with the \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise.\n\n\nRing cap guns are usually modeled after revolver pistols, with the cap ring placed in the cylinder section of the toy gun. Like its real-world counterpart, when the trigger is pulled, the cylinder rotates a new cap into place, the hammer is drawn back, and then released; the shock causes the cap to explode harmlessly, producing the noise and smoke.\n\nStrip or paper cap guns use the aforementioned cap strip in lieu of the cap ring. As in the ring style of gun, each pull of the trigger advances the cap strip forward, pulls back the hammer to the point where it releases, striking the cap.\n\nPotato or spud guns occasionally use a cap to provide a burst of gas to fire the projectile, a small cutting of potato. One design employs a small reusable metal \"cartridge\" which has a recess for a cap at one end and a small drilling through to the other end, which holds the potato. Due to the low energy contained in a paper cap and the poor seal around the cartridge, these spud guns usually have very modest range, barely enough to eject the potato cutting.\n\nMattel introduced a modified type of roll cap that used sprocket feed instead of simple friction feed.\n\nBeginning in 1988, cap guns and other toy guns in the United States must be manufactured with a bright orange, red, or yellow tip placed over the \"muzzle\" of the cap gun, or with the entire gun made in these or other bright colours. Laws requiring these markings were made because of incidents where children and teenagers were killed by police officers who mistook cap guns for real guns. While these incidents were rare, lawmakers decided that toy guns must be marked so they cannot be mistaken for real guns.\n\nCaps have occasionally been used in toys other than cap guns where an explosive effect is desired. One example would be the \"Thunder Punch\" version of the He-Man action figure from the original 1980s Masters of the Universe toy line. Ring caps were placed in a \"backpack\" integrated into the figure, which contained the striking mechanism for the caps (as well as tiny vents to allow smoke from a triggered cap to escape). This mechanism was triggered by drawing the figure's spring-loaded right arm back and releasing it to swing forward; the explosion of the cap was intended to simulate a thunderous noise caused by the superhuman power of the character's punch. Similar cap firing mechanisms for toy soldiers were produced in Germany for the Elastolin and Lineol toy soldiers and artillery pieces.\n\nAnother example is a relatively new type of Airsoft, called Hybrid Guns. Hybrid guns use small round BBs in the tip of a casing, usually designed to mimic that of its respective magazine. The caps are placed behind the casing. In electric models, the caps are burst, and the pressure is used to propel the BB forward in a manner similar to real firearms. The leftover energy is then sometimes put to use simulating recoil and a blowback system that ejects the casings.\n\nAlso, caps are used in Chinese toy flare guns. The cap propels one or two pyrotechnic star loads in flare cartridge (firearms).\n\nAnother use is in so-called \"cap bombs\"; devices roughly in the shape of an aerial bomb that contain a firing mechanism in the nose capable of holding a single cap, either plastic or paper (cut from a strip), though types are not interchangeable due to the mutually exclusive design. With the newer designs they have both the paper cap or plastic cap. When dropped on a hard surface, the impact detonates the cap.\n\nAnother use is in \"exploding pens\" which are devices that look like ink pens but these contain an anvil where the explosive cap is placed, then a spring-loaded lever is pulled back and held in place by the cap of the pen. The pen is then ready to leave around or given to another person as a practical joke. When an unsuspecting person pulls the cap of the pen off, the spring drives the lever against the explosive cap for a surprise bang.\n\n\n"}

The tradition is especially cultivated in modern-day Poland, where alternatively thirteen meatless dishes on Christmas Eve are sometimes served.\n\nThe specific dishes may differ from country to country, but many of them are universal. Due to the Nativity Fast, no meat, eggs or milk (including cheese) are allowed during the supper. Thus fish, mushrooms and various types of grain are the main offerings.\n\nIn Poland the supper begins with eating soups, traditionally mushroom soup or barszcz. The ritual for Catholics and Orthodox Christians in Ukraine is to start \"Sviata Vecheria\" with Kutia. Kutia, poppy milk (\"aguonų pienas\") together with \"kūčiukai\" are served as a dessert and forms a significant part of the Lithuanian Christmas Eve menu. Poppy seeds are widely used for Christmas Eve dishes, because they symbolise abundance and prosperity. In this respect, it was believed that varenyky, which are also a symbol of prosperity, with poppy-seed filling when served at Ukrainian Sviata Vecheria have the most magical potential for bringing prosperity and fecundity to the villager.\n\nRegarding the fish dishes, these are usually herring, carp or pike. In Lithuania, herring () dishes are popular and diverse. Usually \"silkė su morkomis\" (herring with carrots), or \"silkė su grybais\" (herring with mushrooms) are served on Christmas Eve.\n\nMushrooms, especially dried or pickled, are also one of the main ingredients used in Christmas Eve dishes. Sauerkraut (Polish: \"kiszona kapusta\", Ukrainian: \"кисла капуста\"; kisla kapústa) with wild mushrooms or peas, red borscht, mushroom or fish soups are served in Poland and western Ukraine.\n\nBoiled or deep fried dumplings (Polish: pierogi, Ukrainian: вареники, varenyky, Lithuanian: auselės) with a wide variety of fillings (including cabbage or sauerkraut, mushrooms and crushed poppy seeds), are among the most popular dishes. Doughnuts filled with jam (Polish: pączki, Ukrainian: пампушки, pampushky) are served for dessert in Poland and western Ukraine, but in Lithuania sweet dishes are not common, as they are believed to be inappropriate for the solemn atmosphere of the evening.\n\nAs for beverages, traditionally dried fruit kompot or cranberry kisiel () are common. In earlier times oaten kisiel was more common.\n\nThere is the whole ritual before the meal begins. Once the first star appears on the sky, each member of the family washes his face, hands and legs in cold water saying: \"Be as healthy as this water is.\" The most brave people go to local rivers or lakes and have a short swim there. After the water procedure is finished, the family goes on with a prayer, often the Our Father. After the prayer the head of the household will anoint each person present with honey, making the sign of the Cross on their forehead, saying: \"In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: may you have sweetness and many good things in life and in the new year.\"\n\nThe Christmas Eve supper is usually held under candlelight and starts in the evening after the first star appears in the sky. The star symbolizes the birth of Jesus in Christian tradition and a soul of deceased ancestors in pre-Christian beliefs. Quiet, dim-lighting, and a somewhat mystical atmosphere is characteristic for Christmas Eve supper.\n\nIn Poland, Lithuania and western Ukraine an extra plate and seat are always left at the table. According to the folk beliefs, the spirits of the departed members of the family visit on the night. It is also very customary to be even more hospitable and invite unexpected visitors to the supper.\n\n"}

A full-service fixed-base operator (FBO), TAC Air, provides service to general aviation, airline, and military operators.\n\nThe airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a \"primary commercial service\" airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year). In 2013, the airport had 82,742 passenger boardings (enplanements).\n\nSince 1953, FSM has also been the home to Fort Smith Air National Guard Station and the Arkansas Air National Guard's 188th Wing (188 WG). Formerly a fighter wing that previously operated F-4 Phantom II, F-16 Fighting Falcon, and A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft, the 188th Wing currently features three primary mission sets: Remotely Piloted Aircraft (MQ-9 Reaper); ISR (Distributed Ground Station-Arkansas); and Targeting (Space-Focused).\n\nAir Traffic services are provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from an Air Traffic Control (ATC) Tower and TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control).\n\nThe airline terminal offers efficient operational space, convenience of close to the door parking, complimentary Wi-Fi, wingback seating, and the restrooms were voted the America's Best Public Restroom in 2005. The Fort Smith Air Museum is located within the airline terminal.\n\nFort Smith Regional Airport covers an area of 1,359 acres (550 ha) at an elevation of 469 feet (143 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with asphalt surfaces: 7/25, the primary runway, is 8,017 by 150 feet (2,444 x 46 m) with dual instrument landing systems and can accommodate the largest aircraft; 1/19, the crosswind runway, is 5,001 by 150 feet (1,524 x 46 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending July 31, 2011, the airport had 41,990 aircraft operations, an average of 115 per day: 51% general aviation, 34% military, 11% air taxi, and 4% scheduled commercial. At that time there were 102 aircraft based at this airport: 53% single-engine, 21% military, 16% multi-engine, 10% jet, and 1% helicopter.\n\nHistorically, Fort Smith was served by Braniff International Airways and Mid-Continent Airlines with both airlines commencing service to the airport during the 1940s. In 1965, Braniff introduced the first scheduled passenger jet service into the airport with British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven twin jets with nonstop flights to Shreveport and Tulsa and direct service to Kansas City, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New Orleans, Omaha and other destinations. Braniff would later operate Boeing 727-200 jetliners into Fort Smith with direct, no change of plane service to Chicago, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Kansas City, Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, New York City (JFK Airport) and Oklahoma City as well as nonstop 727 flights to Little Rock, Shreveport and Tulsa during the mid 1970s. Braniff began serving Fort Smith during the late 1940s with Douglas DC-3 aircraft flying a daily round trip routing of Denver-Amarillo-Oklahoma City-Tulsa-Muskogee, OK-Fort Smith-Little Rock-Memphis and later operated Convair 340 and Convair 440 propliners into the airport before switching to jets during the mid 1960s. Mid-Continent Airlines began service to Fort Smith in 1946 flying a daily round trip routing of Kansas City-Joplin-Tulsa-Muskogee, OK-Fort Smith-Texarkana-Shreveport-New Orleans with Douglas DC-3 aircraft. Mid-Continent was acquired by and merged into Braniff International in 1952.\n\nDuring the mid 1970s, the original Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) was operating Boeing 737-200 jetliners and Convair 580 turboprops from the airport with nonstop service to Dallas/Ft. Worth. By the late 1970s, Frontier had added Boeing 737-200 jet flights nonstop to Little Rock and Tulsa with direct one stop 737 service to Memphis and Oklahoma City in addition to nonstop 737 jet flights to Dallas/Ft. Worth. During the early 1980s, Frontier was flying nonstop Boeing 737-200 jet service to Atlanta and Wichita. The 737 flights to Wichita also provided one stop direct service to Denver. At this same time, Frontier was continuing to operate nonstop flights to Dallas/Ft. Worth with Convair 580 turboprops. Frontier began serving Fort Smith in 1967 when it acquired Central Airlines which had operated flights from the airport since the mid 1950s. At the time of the merger with Frontier in 1967, Central was providing service from Fort Smith to Dallas/Ft. Worth, Kansas City, Little Rock, Oklahoma City, St. Louis, Tulsa and other destinations with Convair 600 turboprops and Douglas DC-3 prop aircraft. Frontier then continued to serve these destinations from Fort Smith. Central began serving the airport during the mid 1950s with Douglas DC-3 flights to Dallas and Fort Worth via Paris, TX; to Tulsa and Oklahoma City via Muskogee, OK; to Kansas City via Fayetteville, AR and Joplin, MO; and to Little Rock via Hot Springs, AR.\n\nDelta Connection operated by Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA, now ExpressJet) flew Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprop service nonstop to Dallas/Ft. Worth from the late 1980s to the late 1990s. This service ended when Delta closed its hub operation at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW).\n\nFollowing its acquisition of Republic Airlines (1979-1986) in 1986, Northwest Airlines established a hub in Memphis. By 1989, Northwest Airlink operated by Express Airlines I (now Endeavor Air) was flying nonstop service between Memphis and Fort Smith with British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 and Saab 340 turboprops on behalf of Northwest via a code sharing agreement.\n\nDelta Connection then added a nonstop flight to Atlanta in 2007. With the merger of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines the service to Atlanta was temporarily discontinued, thus leaving Fort Smith with Delta Connection service only to the Memphis hub. On June 7, 2012, service to Atlanta was restored with a single daily flight. Later that year, Delta then terminated Memphis service on September 5, but kept the same number of flights into Fort Smith by increasing service to Atlanta to three flights a day operated by Delta Connection with Canadair CRJ-200 regional jets.\n\nAmerican Eagle service to Dallas/Ft. Worth was initially operated by Metroflight Airlines, a division of Metro Airlines, with Convair 580 turboprops via a code sharing agreement with American Airlines during the early and mid 1980s. The DFW service operated on behalf of American was then flown with Saab 340 turboprops from the late 1980s to the late 1990s in competition with the Delta Connection service to DFW. American Eagle then operated ATR 72 turboprop aircraft with nonstop service to Dallas/Ft. Worth until the late 2000s when it switched to Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets.\n\nOn September 1, 2015, Delta Connection switched to using Canadair CRJ-700 regional jet aircraft featuring first class as well as coach seats. At the same time, flights to Atlanta were reduced from three to two flights per day.\n\nThe following airlines offer scheduled passenger service:\n\nPassenger Boardings by Year (from FAA data)\n\n"}

The Dirtbombs were formed by Mick Collins (of the influential garage punk band The Gories) as a side project and started recording songs by 1995.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since its conception, The Dirtbombs has been home to many Detroit rock musicians, both in the studio and on the road. As of September 2008 the band's lineup consists of Collins on guitar, Ko Melina (formerly of Ko & The Knockouts) on a distorted “fuzz” baritone guitar and Ben Blackwell (owner of record label Cass Records) and Pat Pantano (formerly of the Come Ons) on the two drum sets.\n\nNoted producer Jim Diamond played bass from 1997 until 2004 and during that time Diamond also recorded and co-produced the Dirtbombs output with Mick Collins at his Ghetto Recorders studio in Detroit. Troy Gregory (formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, Prong, and lead singer of The Witches and Troy Gregory & The Stepsisters) played bass from June 2004 to September 5, 2008, also constituting one of the longest runs of any Dirtbombs member: the four-year line-up of Collins, Pantano, Blackwell, Melina, and Gregory is the longest lasting Dirtbombs line-up to date. For a brief time in 2002, the band featured back-up singers Deanne Iovan (also formerly of the Come Ons) and future bass player Ko, in addition to five musicians.\n\nOriginally conceived as a “singles band”, the Dirtbombs were to record only 7” records each in a radically different style. The band's first single, \"High Octane Salvation\", was released in 1996. The band released two singles in 1997, and also appeared on the \"Ghettoblaster Volume 1\" compilation. They released another two singles in 1998.\n\nLos Angeles-based independent label In The Red Records persuaded the Dirtbombs to record an LP. Collins decided that if the band were to record a full-length album they would treat it like a giant single, centering on one musical idea or genre. The full-length 1998 debut \"Horndog Fest\" is a mix of heavy garage punk and pop-inclined rock 'n roll. The songs \"I Can't Stop Thinking About It\", \"Granny's Little Chicken\", and \"Shake Shivaree\" remain live staples. \"I Can't Stop Thinking About It\" was used in a Buick commercial in 2007 and was later covered acoustically by the Romantics.\n\nIn 2000, the band released 2 singles, as well as a split single with The White Stripes. They also appeared on the \"X-Mas Surprise Package Volume 3\" compilation, and backed Andre Williams on two songs on his \"The Black Godfather\" LP.\n\nThe Dirtbombs enjoyed a boost in recognition after the release of their second album, \"Ultraglide in Black\", in 2001, a collection of nearly all soul, R & B, and Motown covers, with one original track - \"Your Love Belongs Under A Rock\". Around this time, a garage rock revival became vibrant in the American and European underground, led in part by fellow Detroit band the White Stripes, and the Dirtbombs were part of a multitude of Detroit bands that subsequently received attention from the music industry. Opening for the White Stripes (and with Jack White acknowledging the Gories as a major influence) brought the band increased publicity as well. In 2005, MSNBC.com listed \"Ultraglide\" on their list of the top albums of the past 20 years.\n\n\"Ode to a Black Man\" was taken from the LP for a 2001 single. A five-song EP, \"Chariots of the Gods?\", was also released that year, and the band appeared on the Jack White-produced \"Sympathetic Sounds of Detroit\" compilation that year as well.\n\nTwo new singles were issued in 2002. That same year, the Dirtbombs appeared on four compilations, as well as on Troy Gregory's solo album, \"Sybil\". The band also toured extensively during this time, playing in Europe and Australia, in addition to the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn 2003 the band released their third LP, \"Dangerous Magical Noise\". This album was originally going to be done in the style of bubblegum pop, but Collins ultimately chose to stick with a radio-friendly pop rock style, described by the band as being \" the car-commercial record\". The album featured a re-recorded version of their contribution to the \"Sympathetic Sounds\" compilation, \"I'm Through With White Girls\" written and sung by Jim Diamond. The single \"Motor City Baby\" was featured on Little Steven's Underground Garage as the \"Coolest Song in the World\".\n\nThe band, with Jim Diamond and Tom Potter on bass, was featured on a Dutch television documentary about the Detroit rock scene that also profiled the White Stripes and the Paybacks. Mick took the filmmakers on a tour of the Detroit music scene, and drummed for the White Stripes while they sang Loretta Lynn's \"Rated X\". The documentary concluded with the three of them bowling.\n\nIn 2004 the band headlined the Rock City Fest in Detroit (the show being Jim Diamond's final show with the band). 2004 was also a major year of record releasing: The band released a split LP with King Khan and the Shrines called \"Billiards at Nine Thirty\", a second single from \"Dangerous Magical Noise\", \"Earthquake Heart\", and a pair of new singles. Split singles were also issued, one backed with a Gories song, one with Justin Robertson, and one with ADULT.\n\nIn 2005 the band released \"If You Don't Already Have a Look\" a 2-disc collection of their singles and rarities, as well as six new songs. The band was showcased at the Motor City Music Conference and later in the year they toured Europe making stops in many places on the continent, including the Primavera Sound Festival in Spain and headlining tour dates in Zagreb and Belgrade.\n\nA new split with the Love Supremes was issued, and the band also appeared on a Gun Club tribute record that year. In the summer of 2006, the song \"Trainwreck\" was used in a Walmart television commercial.\n\nIn October, the band played in Rivera Court at the Detroit Institute of Arts for the premiere of a documentary film called \"It Came From Detroit\", in which the band was featured prominently in interviews and live footage. In May 2007 The Dirtbombs were invited by director Julian Schnabel to play at the Cannes Film Festival in honor of their song \"Chains of Love\", from the \"Ultraglide\" LP, being featured in his award-winning \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\".\n\nIn September, the band played at the reopening of the Crofoot Ballroom in Pontiac, Michigan.\n\nThe band released one single in 2007, a cover of the Black Lips' \"Oh Katrina\".\n\nRecording of \"We Have You Surrounded\", the fourth In The Red LP, began in November 2006 as a five-song EP. The length of time since the band's last full-length, 2003's \"Dangerous Magical Noise\", led to the decision to finish it as an LP, once again postponing the bubblegum record. Recording resumed in the summer of 2007, and \"We Have You Surrounded\" was released in February 2008. Far from being bubblegum, the album's themes are dark. The song \"Leopard Man at C & A\" features lyrics taken from comic book writer Alan Moore's poem of the same name, (described by Collins as \"a fabulous take on urban paranoia\").\n\nIn support of \"We Have You Surrounded\", the band embarked on tours of the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Festival appearances included the Golden Plains Festival in Australia, The Voodoo Music Experience in New Orleans, the Afro Punk Festival in Brooklyn, and the All Tomorrow's Parties's Nightmare Before Christmas Festival in England. In July 2008, the band returned to the eastern U.S., opening for Spiritualized, and later touring with TV on the Radio in the Fall.\n\nFive singles were issued in 2008: a cover of a Suicide song on the Irish label Infirmary Phonographic; an INXS covers single on Australian label Stained Circles; a Sparks covers single on In The Red, which includes \"Sherlock Holmes\", also found on \"We Have You Surrounded\" and an iTunes compilation; and two splits on Cass Records with 2008 touring partners - a cover of Detroit proto-punk band Death on a split with touring partner Kelley Stoltz and a split with Dan Sartain.\n\nWhile touring for \"We Have You Surrounded\", Ko Melina stopped playing her parts on a \"fuzzed\" bass and instead started playing a baritone guitar.\n\nIn 2010, The Dirtbombs recorded the title track for .\n\nIn February 2011, the band released their fifth LP, \"Party Store\". A sequel of sorts to \"Ultraglide In Black\", \"Party Store\" features rock covers of early Detroit techno and house music. A companion remix album was released by Scion's Scion A/V label.\n\nIn September 2013, \"Ooey Gooey Chewy Ka-blooey!\", the long-promised bubblegum record, was finally released.\n\nThe Dirtbombs have a long and widely praised history as a live act. Spin magazine listed the Dirtbombs at number 10 in their list of \"Top 25 Live Bands Now\" in the September 2006 issue. The band has opened for a diversity of famous acts: In 2002, the band opened for Blondie on their Michigan and Illinois tour dates, and in subsequent years, they've opened for Mudhoney, Radio Birdman, TV on the Radio and Spiritualized. Over the years, the band has headlined tours with such up and coming bands as the Black Lips, Be Your Own Pet, and Jay Reatard, many of which would go on to become major label acts. In 2002, rising art-punk band Yeah Yeah Yeahs opened for the Dirtbombs at the relatively small Bowery Ballroom in New York. Four years later, the Dirtbombs would open for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at the massively larger Roseland Ballroom, also in New York City. The band jokingly refers to this trend as \"The Dirtbombs Curse\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2317782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317782", "title": "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men", "text": "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\n\nLet Us Now Praise Famous Men is a book with text by American writer James Agee and photographs by American photographer Walker Evans, first published in 1941 in the United States. The work documents the lives of impoverished tenant farmers during the Great Depression. Although it is in keeping with Evans' work with the Farm Security Administration, the project was initiated not by the FSA, but by \"Fortune\" magazine. The title derives from a passage in the Wisdom of Sirach (44:1) that begins, \"Let us now praise famous men, and our fathers that begat us\".\n\n\"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\" grew out of an assignment that Agee and Evans accepted in 1936 to produce a \"Fortune\" article on the conditions among sharecropper families in the American South during the \"Dust Bowl\". It was the time of U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt's \"New Deal\" programs designed to help the poorest segments of the society. Agee and Evans spent eight weeks that summer researching their assignment, mainly among three white sharecropping families mired in desperate poverty. They returned with Evans' portfolio of stark images—of families with gaunt faces, adults and children huddled in bare shacks before dusty yards in the Depression-era nowhere of the deep south—and Agee's detailed notes. \n\nAs he remarks in the book's preface, the original assignment was to produce a \"photographic and verbal record of the daily living and environment of an average white family of tenant farmers\". However, as the \"Literary Encyclopedia\" points out, \"Agee ultimately conceived of the project as a work of several volumes to be entitled \"Three Tenant Families\", though only the first volume, \"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\", was ever written\". Agee considered that the larger work, though based in journalism, would be \"an independent inquiry into certain normal predicaments of human divinity\".\n\nAgee, who writes modestly and self-consciously about his privileged position in the book's creation, appears as a character himself at times in the narrative, as when he agonizes over his role as \"spy\" and intruder into these humble lives. At other times, as when he simply lists the contents of a sharecropper's shack or the meager articles of clothing they have to wear on Sunday, he is altogether absent. The strange ordering of books and chapters, the titles that range from mundane (\"Clothes\") to \"radically artistic\" (as the \"New York Times\" put it), the direct appeals by Agee for the reader to see the humanity and grandeur of these horrible lives, and his suffering at the thought that he cannot accomplish his appointed task, or should not, for the additional suffering it inflicts on his subjects, are all part of the book's character.\n\nScholars have noted that the book's ambitious scale and rejection of traditional reporting runs parallel with the creative, non-traditional programs of the U.S. government under Roosevelt. Agee argues with literary, political, and moral traditions that might mean nothing to his subjects but which are important for the larger audience and the larger context of examining others' lives.\n\n\"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\" sold only half its press run following publication, but since then has won high praise over the years and is routinely studied in the U.S. as a source of both journalistic and literary innovation. Reading the book inspired Aaron Copland to write his opera, \"The Tender Land\". David Simon, journalist and creator of acclaimed television series The Wire, credited the book with impacting him early in his career and informing his practice of journalism.\n\nThroughout the book, Agee and Evans use pseudonyms to obscure the identity of the three tenant farmer families. This convention is retained in the 1989 follow-up book by D. Maharidge and M. Williamson \"And Their Children After Them: The Legacy of \"Let us now praise famous men\" : James Agee, Walker Evans, and the Rise and Fall of Cotton in the South.\" However Evans' photos that are archived in the Library of Congress American Memory Project have the original names of the photographic subjects.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> There is disagreement over whether the family name is properly spelled Tengle or Tingle. The Library of Congress's spelling is used here.\n\nIn 1966 the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired the 135-minute dramatic feature, \"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\", George Whalley's adaptation of the book. The broadcast was produced by John Reeves, who has written about the radio production.\n\n"}

Muhammad asked: \"Uncle, why have you married her off to Hubayra and ignored me?\" Abu Talib replied: \"Nephew, they are our in-laws, and the noble is an equal for the noble.\" This cryptic reply might have meant that Abu Talib owed a favour to the Makhzum clan; but the more likely meaning was that Muhammad had no money.\n\nHubayra, who was a poet, is described as \"wise and influential\". He and Fakhitah had at least seven children, 3 daughters and 4 sons: Hani (from whom she took her \"kunya\" Umm Hani), Ja'da, Yusuf, Umar, Fulan, Aqla and Amr.\n\nMuhammad was a guest in Fakhitah's house one night in 621. The next morning he told her that he had miraculously travelled to Jerusalem and then to Heaven during the night. She urged him not to tell anyone, as the Quraysh would only laugh at him, and she tried to restrain him physically. Muhammad ignored this advice.\n\nFakhitah became a Muslim when Muhammad conquered Mecca in January 630. Hubayra did not want to convert, so he fled from Mecca and took refuge in the Christian city of Najran. This caused an automatic divorce. Muhammad proposed to Fakhita again, but she refused him, saying that she would not be able to do justice to both young children and a new husband. Muhammad responded: \"The Quraysh are the best women on camel-back! They are so kind to their children and so careful of their husbands' property!\"\n\nLater Fakhitah told Muhammad that her children had grown up and she was now ready to marry him. He told her that she was too late, since a new revelation had forbidden him to marry any first cousin who had not emigrated to Medina before the Conquest.\n\nHer date of death is unknown; however, she outlived her brother Ali, who was killed in 661.\n"}

{"id": "2317809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317809", "title": "Hot box", "text": "Hot box\n\nA hot box is the term used when an axle bearing overheats on a piece of railway rolling stock. The term is derived from the journal-bearing trucks used before the mid-20th century. The axle bearings were housed in a box that used oil-soaked rags or cotton (collectively called \"packing\") to reduce the friction of the axle against the truck frame. When the oil leaked or dried out, the bearings overheated, often starting a fire that could destroy the entire railroad car (and cars coupled to it) if not detected early enough.\n\nThe packing and bearing had to be regularly inspected by yard crews, and packing was often added at major stops. The journal bearing was replaceable, but if neglected, it would heat to a temperature where the babbitt bearing alloy would melt away, leaving the brass carrier riding on the steel axle, and result in a \"taper journal\". This would eventually lead to the axle fracturing and the car above falling onto the wheel, or failure of the taper journal, causing the side frame and journal box to fall below the level of the rails, either of which could cause a major derailment of the train. Train worker duties consisted partly of inspecting the train as it ran by, looking for smoke, sparks, or fire. They would then sound the audible report \"All Black\" to mean the train was not giving off any light energy that would indicate combustion or destruction of the wheel bearings. If the train worker saw \"Red\" or smoke, he would alert other crew members, or else make an emergency stop to the train to prevent further damage.\n\nWhen this type of axle box was used, any diesel exhaust smells had to be tracked to their source, as a hot-box sometimes smells similar. Most of the larger railroads use defect detectors to scan passing trains for hot box conditions. Some of these detectors also have \"automated mile posts\" which send an automated radio signal to the train crew listing the train number, track number, number of axles on the train and train speed.\n\nModern ball, roller or tapered bearings can also overheat, but the likelihood of a roller bearing overheating is usually far smaller than with journal bearings. When modern bearings do fail, the balls or rollers and their races fail, generating heat which can ignite fires or be the ignition source of a dust explosion in grain, coal, sawdust, etc.\n\n\n"}

Colbertism is a variant of mercantilism that is sometimes seen as its synonym. It is more a collection of economical practices than a true current of economic thought.\n\nColbert's central principle was that the wealth and the economy of France should serve the state. Drawing on the ideas of mercantilism, he believed state intervention was needed to secure the largest part of limited resources. To accumulate gold, a country always had to sell more goods abroad than it bought. Colbert sought to build a French economy that sold abroad and bought domestically.\n\nIn the 17th century, European powers had already successfully colonized some part of the world. England had a successful hold on North America and various other areas, including India, Spain had a large hold of South America and North America, and the Dutch had successful outposts in India. The French were beginning to colonize parts of North America, but did not have permanent settlements like the Spanish and British colonies.\n\nIn 1628, Quebec became controlled by the Company of One Hundred Associates, a merchant-run joint-stock enterprise founded by Cardinal Richelieu. The Company received a monopoly over fur trade, and title to all the lands in New France, in trade for 4,000 settlers to the new colony, as well as supplies and priests. Like all other colonies, French influence in the New World led to problems with the natives: war for control of the fur trade and novel diseases killed off large portions of First Nations tribes.\n\nFrance not only had colonies in North America, but also controlled the French West Indies, in the Caribbean Sea. During the 17th century, France colonized several of the West Indian Islands because of competition with the Spanish, English, and Dutch. Despite controlling very many of the West Indian Islands, only Martinique, Guadeloupe, and some nearby small islands survived as the French West Indies.\n\nQuite surprisingly, the idea of mercantilism was first described by the French finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Colbert's idea was a \"favorable balance of trade\" in which goods were exported for gold, versus an \"unfavorable balance of trade\" in which gold would flow out of the country. Colbert also intended to get rid of internal tariffs, and to tax the nobility, but failed.\n\nThe simplified objectives of mercantilism in terms of Colbertism were to improve the structure of taxes in the fiscal administration, or in the burden of taxes can enhance the nation’s wealth, and of all the devices for increasing royal revenues in the king’s fiscal arsenal the best is to improve trade and industry.\n\nColbert immediately struck back at the financiers and tax farmers who had made enormous profits from loans and advances to the state treasury, by holding tribunals to make them give back some of their gains. \nColbert focused his efforts next on reforming the system of taxation. At the time, the King derived the major part of his revenue from a tax called the taille, levied in some districts on individuals and in other districts on land and businesses. The taille was not a rate on income or production but what the French call an impôt de reparation, which means its global sum was fixed in advance of the fiscal year by the royal council, which directed its officials to compensate for lower revenues in one district by higher revenues in another. However, in some districts the taille was apportioned and collected by royal officials, essentially meaning it was voted by the representatives of the district.\n\nThe Crown in the 16th century realized that revenues from its indirect taxes would rise and fall in response to prosperity and depression, but such fluctuations were resisted as much as possible by the system of farming these indirect taxes, which kept the bid prices as high and as stable as possible.\n\nAt the same time, some clergy and nobles, were exempt from the taxes altogether.\n\nColbert sought to make the tax less oppressive by levying the taille on all who should be taxed, and started a review of titles of nobility to discover and expose those falsely claiming exemption. These reforms in combination with the close supervision of the officials concerned brought large sums into the treasury.\n\nHe also changed the tariff system, as a revised in 1664 as part of a system of protection. However, during the Renaissance in internal traits foraines were applied not only to additional commodities but also to additional provinces. Renaissance kings strongly resisted the efforts of tax farmers to unify the administration of these taxes which gave justification that when associations of tax farmers were allowed to bid on grosses fermes they conspired to keep the bid prices down. When examining the import tariffs it can be seen that they were few and far between and that they appear to be devices to force merchants to buy import licenses rather than part of projects to build up the French industry.\n\nHe spent a lot of energy trying to reorganize industry and commerce. He believed that in order to increase French power it would be essential to grow France’s share of international trade and reduce the commercial hegemony of the Dutch.\n\nHe stressed the production of high-quality goods that could compete with foreign products abroad but also the building up of a merchant fleet to carry them.\n\nHe tried to encourage foreign workers to bring their trade skills to France. To guarantee the standard of workmanship, he made regulations for every sort of manufacture and imposed fines and pillory for counterfeiting and shortcomings\n\nHe encouraged the formation of companies dedicated to building ships and attempted to obtain monopolies for French commerce abroad through the formation of trading companies. \nHis system of control was resented by traders and contractors, who wanted to preserve their freedom of action and to be responsible to themselves alone. Thrifty people preferred land, annuities and money lending instead of investing in industry.\n\nIn May 1665, the king established monopoly privileges for a group of French lace manufacturers. The point of this was to prohibit anyone other than the privileged licensees from making lace.\n\nProtective tariffs were levied on imported lace, so it could only be made in France. And then in 1667 they prohibited all foreign lace.\n\nThey next enforced quality standards on production and trade, which meant that the French economy was frozen at the level of the early or mid-17th century. This act prevented or slowed down innovation in new products, new technologies, and new methods of handling production and exchange.\n\nHe granted monopolies, subsidized luxury and the privilege of cartels, and built up a system of central bureaucracy. He created a formidable system of inspection, marks and measurements to be able to identify all those who were straying from the detailed list of state regulations.\n\nHe created a system of spies to make sure nobody was differing from the system, with punishments rating from heavy fines, public mockery or the inability to keep working in the industry.\n\nAs a result of the strictly enforced mercantilism and French absolutism, France was put out of the running as a leading nation in industrial or economic growth.\n\nIn 1670, Colbert made one of his most important single policy statements, in his famous memoire on finances. They can be expressed as follows: the object of economic statesmanship is to provide the monarch with the funds he needs for order and glory. Colonies can be planted and nurtured, home manufacturing improved in quality, internal transportation strengthened, the shipping industry expanded and the idle forced to work. Budgetary control must be put on a sound basis and the dominant revenues must be built up as much as possible. At the heart of this policy was the effort to increase royal revenues indirectly, through economic improvements. The universal rule according to Colbert is to control the economy and the fiscal system so that a sufficient quantity of cash will circulate in every corner of the country, giving all French the opportunity to make profits and pay taxes. His idea on how to lighten taxes was to \"increase the cash available for general commerce [that is, all transactions] by attracting cash from other countries, keeping it inside the kingdom, and hindering its export, thus giving men the means to profit from it\".\n\nSince World War II, high-tech Colbertism has been the historic form used for the intervention of a sovereign nation state, armed with a monopoly of the general interest, in the \"industries of the future\". There are five different qualities that can summarize this model and call into question assumed ideas about interventionism in France.\n\nHigh-Tech Colbertism ended its course at the beginning of the 1980s when the need of adaptation and external constraints collided. This policy was considered a success by the French Development Party, as France experienced a tremendous growth in the post war years and transformed itself into an industrial powerhouse. \nHowever, there were some shortcomings in these policies as major failures in the computer and machine tool industry occurred.\n\nThe first quality is offensive protectionism. A sovereign state will create a means of accumulation of scientific and financial resources. It will provide future national champions with grants, secures markets through procurement policies and will prevent foreign entry. The reasons for doing so are always, defense, technological autonomy and national sovereignty. However, success in the international marketplace is the ultimate goal.\n\nThese innovations are not only scientific or technical in nature. Nuclear power, space industry and speed trains amongst others prove that innovation is important in bringing together different actors from different fields and making them accountable for the success of a venture. National technologies were abandoned in order to guarantee the collective aim and success of the plan as a whole.\n\nIn addition, a grand project is only possible within a flexible state. The hybrid of administration-enterprise embodies two ideas: regalian authority and the logic of an enterprise. \nThis \"Grand Project\" can only emerge when the objectives of industry participants converge with those of the overall policy. Leaving aside the convenient abstraction of the state, the \"Grand Project\" takes off only when a homogeneous elite is capable of mobilizing a workforce committed to the purposes of the state-entrepreneur and of national independence.\n\n\"The 'Grand Project' follows a semence of logics: the 'arsenal' Levic, the logic of public procurement and the logic of the market, which when completed, enriches the national productive systém with new, powerful actors who are sometimes rivals.\"\n\nIts success depends on a transfer of results and close cooperation with industry. This can only be fruitful when the State promotes aggressive protectionism, finances the early stages of industrial development, transfers the results of public research, allows the depreciation of investment over a long period, provides certain markets through public procurement and encourages development by putting the State’s powers at the service of the national champion.\n\nThe five pillars, which the success of the grand plan can be obtained are: technical innovation, emergence of new patterns of consumption, dynamic protectionism, the risk of a new industrial participant and socio-political engineering.\n\nOne of the last identifiable grand plans was that of, which dates back its catchup plan to 1974. Since then, the plans for Minitel satellites, and cable television have appeared, but haven’t given birth to a powerful industry.\n"}

It later merged into the Communist Workers Party of Poland. Its most famous member was Rosa Luxemburg.\n\nThe leading cadre of the SDKPiL were a famous group, many of whom would play a role in the Russian Revolution of October 1917. Chief among them was Rosa Luxemburg, the leading theoretician of the movement. Other notable figures included Leo Jogiches, Julian Marchlewski, Adolf Warski, Felix Dzerzhinsky, Stanisław Pestkowski, Karl Sobelson, Józef Unszlicht, and Jakob Furstenberg. Internationalists, many of them would play leading roles in Germany as well as in Russia.\n\nThe party was founded in 1893 based on an internationalist Marxist program. At its core was the Union of Polish Workers which refused to back the national demands contained within the program of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). As a result of the differing positions on the question of Polish national independence the former Union of Polish Workers and the Second Proletariat left the PPS in 1893 establishing the SDKP, differences between the two parties deepening at the International Socialist Congress of August 1893 when the All-Polish delegation, led by Ignacy Daszyński of Galicia opposed seating Karski and Rosa Luxemburg now making her first appearance at an international gathering. Differences were to deepen at the next International Socialist Congress in 1896 where Luxemburg was opposed by the future dictator of Poland, Józef Piłsudski, representing the PPS.\n\nConceived as the geographical representative party of the workers, rather than national, the SDKP was to fuse with the Union of Workers in Lithuania in 1899 as a result of the work carried out by Feliks Dzierżyński, future Bolshevik head of the Cheka. The SDKP becoming the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania. The young party enjoyed a period of growth impelled by the organisational efforts of Dzierżyński in Warsaw before he was arrested again.\n\nConsistent with its self-conception as a geographic unit of an All-Russian Social Democratic party, the SDKPiL attended the 1903 Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) held in London at which the famous division occurred between the Menshevik and Bolshevik factions. The delegation from the SDKPiL was concerned chiefly with maintaining its own autonomy within the party as a whole and with the removal of recognition of the Right of Nations to Self Determination from the party's program. This was the beginning of the long dispute between the Polish and Russian Social Democrats on this question. Only a little while later theoretical differences would also develop in regard to the Bolshevik slogan of \"the Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and the Peasantry\" which the Polish revolutionaries rejected.\n\nThe War with Japan and the Russian Revolution of 1905 saw the party playing a leading role in the struggle. Strongly defeatist towards the Tsarist state the SDKPiL opposed the PPS which adopted a pro-Japanese stance. However, as the tide of struggle rose the party worked ever more closely with the Bund and the left wing of the PPS. Luxemburg returned from exile and the Mass Strike was placed at the centre of the organisation's revolutionary theory. Despite this emphasis on the actions of the masses the party disposed of fighting squads which defended the workers movement from the Tsarist authorities.\nBy 1906 the party had 40,000 members. 70% were Polish, 25% German and 5% were Jewish.\n\nThe period after the revolution was one of retreat for the left and the SDKPiL was to split into two factions as a result. Always closely connected to the RSDLP the Polish party's problems were intricately interwoven with those of the Russian Party. Attending the Fifth Congress of the RSDLP held in London in 1907 Jogiches and Warski were elected to the united Central Committee where they assumed a position of support in respect of the Bolshevik faction. In the following years however the All-Russia party almost ceased to exist as a unified body and the SDKPiL itself distanced itself from all the Russian factions while seeking to promote unity of the various factions. This perspective ensured that Leon Trotsky was to be a frequent contributor to the theoretical publication of the SDKPiL the Social Democratic Review. The SDKPiL itself split, in 1911, during the downturn in class struggle of these years with the Warsaw Committee leading a breakaway from the Central Committee dominated by Jogiches.\n\nDespite divisions in its ranks the entire party adopted an internationalist position with the onset of World War I in 1914. The Warsaw Committee of the SDKPiL called a conference of all revolutionary factions for August 2 at which both the Warsaw Committee and Central Committee were joined by the PPS Lewica (Left) and the Bund. The conference issued an unequivocal denunciation of imperialist war and called for the workers to take state power. Despite this attempts to coordinate the different parties came to nothing. But as the war continued both social democratic factions joined the Zimmerwald movement with the Warsaw Committee becoming particularly close to the Bolsheviks. The growing clarification of right and left internationally would enable the two factions of the party to reunify at a congress held on November 4, 1916, a new Central Committee was elected and the party pledged support to the Zimmerwald movement.\n\nThe February Revolution of 1917 in Russia saw the Russian Provisional Government issue a manifesto on March 30 recognising Poland's right to an autonomous status, while the Petrograd Soviet recognised Poland's right to self-determination. Those Polish Social Democrats working with the Bolsheviks (such as Dzierżyński and Julian Leszczyński (Leński)) vehemently dissented. The end of the war in 1918 saw SDKPiL members spread throughout revolutionary Europe and playing leading roles everywhere they went. Thus Luxemburg and Jogiches stood at the head of the newly founded Communist Party of Germany (KPD, founded 1918), while Dzierżyński, Radek and Yakov Hanecki all participated fully in the October Revolution in Russia and took up posts in the nascent Soviet government. The history of the SDKPiL drew to a close when its influence and that of its members had never been as widespread. In 1918, many of the party's members would take part in the movement of workers' councils in Poland, before eventually merging with the PPS Lewica to form the Communist Workers Party of Poland.\n\n"}

Outland\n\nJohn Henry Outland (March 17, 1871 – March 24, 1947) was an American football player and coach. He played football at Penn College in Oskaloosa, Iowa, the University of Kansas, and the University of Pennsylvania. He was twice named an All-American while playing for the Penn Quakers, in 1897 as a tackle and in 1898 as a halfback. After playing, Outland coached at Franklin & Marshall College in 1900, the University of Kansas in 1901, and Washburn University from 1904 to 1905, compiling a career college football record of 21–15–2. He is the namesake of the Outland Trophy, an annual award established in 1946 and given to the best interior lineman in college football. Outland was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 2001.\n\nOutland was born in Hesper, Kansas to Thomas Outland and Mahala Outland (née Kemp) into a Quaker family who settled in Kansas from Indiana around 1860 during the Bleeding Kansas period as part of a larger Quaker immigration to Kansas in support of the Free State cause. He grew up mostly in Johnson County, Kansas in the towns of Lexington, Kansas (present day DeSoto, Kansas) and Edgerton, Kansas though. He was a member of the first football team at Penn College in Oskaloosa, Iowa in 1891. Outland captained the team in 1892, scoring 32 of the team's 36 points. After starring in football and baseball at the University of Kansas in 1895 and 1896, Outland went to Philadelphia to complete his medical education at the University of Pennsylvania. There he became one of the few men ever to win All-American football honors as both lineman and the backfield player. He was picked by Walter Camp as a first-team All-American in 1897, as a tackle. In 1898, he was selected again, this time as a halfback. He was captain of the 1898 Pennsylvania team and was voted \"Most Popular Man\" at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nOutland worked his way through college and spent his last two summers as a companion to rich young men who were alcoholics. To keep them away from alcohol, Outland took them on camping trips in the Wyoming mountains.\n\nIn 1900, Outland coached the football team at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania for one season. His team produced a record of 4–5. He was the 11th coach of the program that began in 1887.\n\nOutland was the eighth head football coach for the University of Kansas Jayhawks located in Lawrence, Kansas and he held that position for the 1901 season. His overall coaching record at Kansas was 3–5–2.\n\nOutland also coached at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. He was the ninth head football coach for Washburn and he held that position for two seasons, from 1904 until 1905. His overall coaching record at Washburn was 14–5.\n\nOutland's 1905 season ended with an experimental game with Fairmount University where a new rule forcing the offense to earn a first down in three plays instead of four was in effect. The experiment was considered a failure.\n\nAfter receiving his medical degree, Outland returned to Kansas in 1900 where he set up his medical practice first in Lawrence, Kansas which led to his hiring as the head football coach of the University of Kansas. On January 28, 1902 Outland married Ethel Arnett Grimes in her hometown of Dana, Indiana. He then moved his practice to Topeka, Kansas in 1904 in order to coach the Washburn University football team. In 1906 Outland moved his family to Kansas City, Kansas where he joined the very first staff of the brand new Trinity-Lutheran hospital in Kansas City, Missouri as a general practicing surgeon. Later, in about 1916, while still on staff with Trinity-Lutheran hospital he moved his family across state lines to Kansas City, Missouri where he lived until his retirement. During his time as a practicing surgeon he extensively used his own plane, often flying with famous Kansas City early aviation pioneer pilot John Kerr \"Tex\" LaGrone, to visit patients in rural areas and far flung towns, being the first doctor in the Kansas City area to do so. While practicing medicine in the Kansas City region, Dr. Outland served for many years on the athletic board of the University of Kansas alongside other notable KU alumni, Dr. James Naismith and Dr. Forrest \"Phog\" Allen amongst others. Dr. Outland also served as a referee for college football games, including the 1907 Iowa State - Nebraska game in which he rendered the decision that negated an Iowa State field goal and preserved a 10-9 Nebraska victory. Upon his retirement he moved to Laguna Beach, California. He also served as a major in the United States Army Medical Corps during World War I.\n\nOutland was the founder of the Kansas Relays, having obtained the inspiration for that event at Penn, when as a student, he saw the Penn Relays just getting under way. For many years he held the post of honorary referee of the Kansas events.\n\nOutland conceived the idea of the Outland Trophy because of his belief that interior lineman were not given enough recognition in college football. The trophy is the third oldest college football trophy. Selection of the winner is made by the Football Writers Association of America.\n\nOutland suffered a stroke in March 1947 and died at his home in Laguna Beach, California two weeks later on March 24, 1947. He was survived by his wife, Ethel, daughter Mrs. Mary McDougall of New Orleans, Louisiana, and son John Grimes Outland of Dallas, Texas. Outland was laid to rest in Maple Grove Cemetery in Wichita, Kansas near his parents' graves.\n\n"}

Her work often centers on the nineteenth century, the lives of women, and alienation.\n\nShe is best known as the author of the best-selling novel \"The Jane Austen Book Club\" that was made into a movie of the same name.\n\nFowler was born in Bloomington, Indiana, and spent the first eleven years of her life there. Her family then moved to Palo Alto, California. Fowler attended the University of California, Berkeley, and majored in political science. After having a child during the last year of her master's program, she spent seven years devoted to child-raising. Feeling restless, Fowler decided to take a dance class, and then a creative writing class at the University of California, Davis. Realizing that she was never going to make it as a dancer, Fowler began to publish science fiction stories, making a name for herself with the short story \"Recalling Cinderella\" (1985) in \"L Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future Volume 1\" (1985) and \"Artificial Things\" (1986), a collection of short stories.\n\nShe began publishing sf with \"Recalling Cinderella\" in \"L Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future, Vol I\" (anth 1985) edited by Algis Budrys\n\nHer first novel, \"Sarah Canary\" (1991), was published to critical acclaim. The novel involves a group of people alienated by nineteenth century America experiencing a peculiar kind of first contact. One character is Chinese American, another putatively mentally ill, a third a feminist, and lastly Sarah herself, an extraterrestrial. Fowler meant for Sarah Canary to \"read like a science fiction novel to a science fiction reader\" and \"like a mainstream novel to a mainstream reader.\" Fowler's intentions were to leave room for the readers’ own interpretation of the text.\n\nFowler also collaborated with Pat Murphy to found the James Tiptree, Jr. Award in 1991, a literary prize for science fiction or fantasy that \"expands or explores our understanding of gender.\" The prize is named for science fiction author Alice Sheldon who wrote under the pen name James Tiptree, Jr. Fowler drew inspiration not only from Sheldon's work, but also from the fact that Sheldon's mother was an adventurer, going on several trips to Africa including a gorilla hunting expedition in 1920. As such, she serves as the inspiration for the protagonist in Fowler's “What I Didn’t See.” The award's main focus is to recognize the authors, male or female, who challenge and reflect shifting gender roles.\n\nHer other genre works also tended to focus on odd corners of the nineteenth century experiencing the unexpected or fantastic. Her second novel, \"The Sweetheart Season\" (1996) is a romantic comedy infused with historical and fantasy elements.\n\nHer 1998 collection, \"Black Glass\", won a World Fantasy Award, and her 2010 collection \"What I Didn't See, and Other Stories\" also won a World Fantasy Award.\n\nHer 2004 novel \"The Jane Austen Book Club\" become a critical and popular success including being on \"The New York Times\" bestsellers list. Although it is not a science fiction or fantasy work, science fiction does play an integral part to the novel's plot.\n\nFowler was an instructor at the Clarion Workshop 2007 in San Diego. She was one of the two Guests of Honor at Readercon 2007.\n\nIn 2008, she won the Nebula Award for the second time for Best Short Story for her 2007 story \"Always\". Her short story “The Pelican Bar” won a Shirley Jackson Award in 2009 and a World Fantasy Award in 2010.\n\nFowler's most recent novel, \"We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves\" (2013) won the Pen/Faulkner Award for 2014, and has been nominated for a 2014 Nebula Award as well. It was shortlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.\n\nFowler was inspired to write her short story \"What I Didn’t See\" after doing research about chimpanzees for her book \"We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves\". During her research, Fowler came across an essay by Donna Haraway which discusses a 1920 expedition that was carried out by the curator of the New York National Museum of History. One of the men on the expedition wanted a woman in the group to kill a gorilla in order to ultimately protect these species. He reasoned that if women could carry out this action, gorillas would no longer be seen as a fearsome animal, and the thrill of killing them would be gone. Fowler's reaction was one of appalled interest, and she was inspired to write “What I Didn’t See” by these findings. It won the short story Nebula Award in 2003.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Arrested and sentenced to death, she was executed shortly after she gave birth to a daughter in custody.\nLiane Berkowitz was born in Berlin, the daughter of conductor Victor Vasilyev and his wife, the singing teacher Catherine Jewsienko. Shortly before her birth, her parents had fled from the Soviet Union. When Liane's father died, her mother Catherine married Henry Berkowitz, who immediately adopted Liane in 1930. The family lived on Viktoria-Luise-Platz in the Schöneberg district.\n\nLiane was fluent in German and Russian. Henry arranged for her education at the private \"Heilsche Abendschule\" gymnasium where she prepared for her \"Abitur\" qualification from 1941. There, she joined a circle of friends which coalesced around her schoolmate Eva Rittmeister and the latter's husband, the neurologist John Rittmeister. Ursula Goetze, Otto Gollnow, Fritz Thiel, and Friedrich Rehmer also belonged to the group. Under the guidance of John Rittmeister, the friends became a circle of Hitler's opponents, who later worked against the Nazi regime together with the left-leaning anti-fascist resistance movement that was led by the Luftwaffe officer Harro Schulze-Boysen. Liane became engaged to Friedrich Rehmer and was pregnant when she was arrested.\n\nTogether with Otto Gollnow, while her fiancé was severely wounded in the hospital, Berkowitz pasted about 100 posters saying \"'Permanent Exhibition - The Nazi Paradise - War - Hunger - Lie - Gestapo - How long?\"\" on the evening of 17 May 1942 in the busy area between Kurfürstendamm and Uhlandstrasse. This was intended as a protest against \"The Soviet Paradise\" exhibition organised by the Nazi Party Propaganda Office, currently taking place at the Berlin Lustgarten. They also wanted to show that anti-fascist resistance in Germany was still active. It is not certain whether during this action Berkowitz and Gollnow were discreetly accompanied and protected by Harro Schulze-Boysen.\n\nIn the context of breaking the Red Orchestra group, Liane Berkowitz was arrested and charged on 26 September 1942. Friedrich Rehmer was still in a Wehrmacht hospital in Britz, where he was recuperating from a serious war injury he had suffered on the Eastern Front. He was arrested in his hospital ward on 29 November. On 18 January 1943, the Second Senate of the \"Reichskriegsgericht\" court-martial convicted Berkowitz and Rehmer together with other friends involved in the adhesive label action \"for aiding the preparation of high treason and aiding the enemy,\" and sentenced them to death. \n\nLiane's and Friedrich's daughter Irina was born on 12 April 1943 in the women's prison on Barnimstraße. The grandmother took care of the child from July 1943. As the \"Reichskriegsgericht\" pronounced the sentence recommendation when checking against Adolf Hitler to dismiss the pregnant Liane Berkowitz from prison, he expressly rejected any reprieve. The death sentence was confirmed by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel and countersigned.\n\nThe young mother was executed in Plötzensee Prison on 5 August 1943, two days before her 19th birthday. Friedrich Rehmer had already been executed as early as on 13 May 1943. In 2013 it was revealed by the BBC that her body, like thousands of others, was delivered to anatomist Hermann Stieve to be dissected for research. Her final resting place is unknown. Her daughter Irina died on 16 October 1943 in hospital in Eberswalde under unclear circumstances.\n\nBerkowitz was a member of the Russian Orthodox Church. Her letters from death row are marked by a deep faith. The Catholic prison chaplain Peter Buchholz enabled her to receive the Holy Communion on the day of her death.\n\n\n\n"}

The novel is mainly a series of statements made in the first person; the protagonist is a woman named Kate who believes herself to be the last human on earth. Though her statements shift quickly from topic to topic, the topics often recur, and often refer to Western cultural icons, ranging from Zeno to Beethoven to Willem de Kooning. Readers familiar with Ludwig Wittgenstein's \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" will recognize stylistic similarities to that work.\n\nThough Markson's original manuscript was rejected fifty-four times, the book, when finally published in 1988 by Dalkey Archive Press, was met with critical acclaim. In particular, the \"New York Times Book Review\" praised it for \"address[ing] formidable philosophic questions with tremendous wit.\" A decade later, David Foster Wallace described it as \"pretty much the high point of experimental fiction in this country\" in an article for \"Salon\" entitled \"Five direly underappreciated U.S. novels >1960.\" Wallace also wrote a long essay on the novel detailing its connections with Wittgenstein, entitled \"The Empty Plenum: David Markson’s \"Wittgenstein’s Mistress\"\" for the 1990 \"Review of Contemporary Fiction\". (In 2012, it was added to the novel as an afterword.)\n\n\"Wittgenstein's Mistress\" is heavy with allusions, references, and parallels right from the title. Several of these include, but are not limited to: Vincent van Gogh, William Gaddis, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Helen of Troy, Achilles, William Shakespeare, and Johannes Brahms. Many of these are used to play with the themes, particularly language and memory, and draw parallels between the narrator, Kate, most notably Helen of Troy.\n\nThe novel explores many themes, most notably memory, language, and loneliness. The faultiness of memory plays a large part throughout the novel as the narrator constantly gets facts wrong, sometimes on correcting herself, other times contradicting herself. These include a variety of topics, ranging from art history to the narrator's past, from facts about her house to even what day it is. Her awareness of her faulty memory creates an uncertainty which gives her anxiety, best demonstrated in the painting of the house section early in the novel.\n\nMuch like the philosopher the novel is named after, language has a very important role. The character feels alone because she cannot communicate with anyone but herself, though she is communicating her ideas to the reader. The fluidity of language is also touched upon. Kate discusses how she once read an English translation of Euripides that was influenced by Shakespeare, then later reflects on Greek translations of Shakespeare that was probably influenced by Euripides.\n\nThe main theme is loneliness. The novel itself is the by product of the narrator, Kate, typing at a typewriter in her own house any thought that comes to her head. Her thoughts rarely describe any non-famous, non-mythical character that isn't dead or left her life. David Foster Wallace described it as an important example of \"serious fiction\", particularly in its examination of solipsism. Kate seems to exhibit solipsism syndrome, most notably at the near end of the book. Many of her anxieties come from feelings of loneliness, abandonment, and betrayal, combined with her conviction that language is insufficient for communicating the events of one’s inner life.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

{"id": "2317857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317857", "title": "Thai Forest Tradition", "text": "Thai Forest Tradition\n\nThe Kammaṭṭhāna Forest Tradition of Thailand (; meaning \"place of work\"), commonly known in the West as the Thai Forest Tradition, is a lineage of Theravada Buddhist monasticism. \n\nThe \"Thai Forest Tradition\" started around 1900 with Ajahn Mun Bhuridatto, who wanted to practice Buddhist monasticism, and its meditative practices, according to the normative standards of pre-sectarian Buddhism. After studying with Ajahn Sao Kantasīlo, and wandering through the north-east of Thailand, Ajahn Mun reportedly became a non-returner, and started to teach in North-East Thailand. He strived for a revival of the oldest Buddhism, insisting on a strict observance of the Buddhist monastic code, known as the Vinaya, and teaching the actual practice of \"jhāna\" and the realisation of \"Nibbāna\".\n\nInitially Ajaan Mun's teachings were met with fierce opposition, but in the 1930s his group was acknowledged as a formal faction of Thai Buddhism, and in the 1950s the relationship with the royal and religious establishment improved. In the 1960s western students started to be attracted, and in the 1970s Thai-oriented meditation groups spread in the west.\n\nThe purpose of practice is to attain the Deathless (Pali: \"amata-dhamma\"), c.q. Nibbāna. Forest teachers directly challenge the notion of dry insight, and teach that \"Nibbāna\" must be arrived at through mental training which includes deep states of meditative concentration (Pali: \"jhāna\"), and \"exertion and striving\" to \"cut\" or \"clear the path\" through the \"tangle\" of defilements, in order to set awareness free.\n\nSome representatives of the tradition regard the pure Original or Radiant Mind that remains when all mental productions are stopped as an undying essence.\n\nBefore authority was centralized in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the region known today as Thailand was a kingdom of semi-autonomous city states (Thai: \"mueang\"). These kingdoms were all ruled by a hereditary local governor, and while independent, paid tribute to Bangkok, the more powerful central city state in the region. Each region had its own religious customs according to local tradition, and substantially different forms of Buddhism existed between mueangs. Though all of these local flavors of regional Thai Buddhism evolved their own customary elements relating to local spirit lore, all were shaped by the infusion of Mahayana Buddhism and Indian Tantric traditions, which arrived in the area prior to the fourteenth century. Additionally, many of the monastics in the villages engaged in behavior inconsistent the Buddhist monastic code (Pali: \"vinaya\"), including playing board games, and participating in boat races and waterfights. \n\nIn the 1820s young Prince Mongkut (1804–1866), the future fourth king of the Rattanakosin Kingdom (Siam), ordained as a Buddhist monk before rising to the throne later in his life. He travelled around the Siamese region, and quickly became dissatisfied with the caliber of Buddhist practice he saw around him. He was also concerned about the authenticity of the ordination lineages, and the capacity of the monastic body to act as an agent that generates good karma (Pali: \"puññakkhettam\", meaning \"merit-field\"). \n\nMongkut started to introduce innovations and reforms to a small number of monks, inspired by his contacts with western intellectuals. He rejected the local customs and traditions, and instead turned to the Pali Canon, studying the texts and developing his own ideas on them. Doubting the validity of the existing lineages, Mongkut searched for a lineage of monks with an authentic practice, which he found among the Burmese Mon people in the region. He reordained among this group, which formed the basis for the Dhammayut movement. Mongkut then searched for replacements of the classical Buddhist texts lost in the final siege of Ayutthaya. He eventually received copies of the Pali Canon as part of a missive to Sri Lanka. With these, Mongkut began a study group to promote understanding of Classical Buddhist principles.\n\nMongkut's reforms were radical, imposing a scriptural orthodoxy on the varied forms of Thai Buddhism of the time, \"trying to establish a national identity through religious reform.\" A controversial point was Mongkut's belief that nibbana can't be reached in our degenerated times, and that the aim of the Buddhist order is to promote a moral way of life, and preserve the Buddhist traditions.\n\nMongkut's brother Nangklao, King Rama III, the third king of the Rattanakosin Kingdom, considered Mongkut's involvement with the Mons, an ethnic minority, to be improper, and built a monastery on the outskirts of Bangkok. In 1836, Mongkut became the first abbot of Wat Bowonniwet Vihara, which would become the administrative center of the Thammayut order until the present day.\n\nThe early participants of the movement continued to devote themselves to a combination of textual study and meditations they had discovered from the texts they had received. However, Thanissaro notes that none of the monks could make any claims of having successfully entered meditative concentration (Pali: \"samadhi\"), much less having reached a noble level.\n\nThe Dhammayut reform movement maintained strong footing as Mongkut later rose to the throne. Over the next several decades the Dhammayut monks would continue with their study and practice.\n\nThe Kammaṭṭhāna Forest Tradition started around 1900 with Ajahn Mun Bhuridatto, who studied with Ajahn Sao Kantasīlo, and wanted to practice Buddhist monasticism, and its meditative practices, according to the normative standards of pre-sectarian Buddhism, which Ajahn Mun termed \"the customs of the noble ones\".\n\nWhile ordained in the Dhammayut movement, Ajaan Sao (1861–1941) questioned the impossibility to attain nibbana. He rejected the textual orientation of the Dhammayut movement, and set out to bring the \"dhamma\" into actual practice. In the late nineteenth century he was posted as abbot of Wat Liap, in Ubon. According to Phra Ajaan Phut Thaniyo, one of Ajaan Sao's students, Ajaan Sao was \"not a preacher or a speaker, but a doer,\" who said very little when teaching his students. He taught his students to \"Meditate on the word 'Buddho,'\" which would aid in developing concentration and mindfulness of meditation objects.\n\nAjaan Mun (1870–1949) went to Wat Liap monastery immediately after being ordained in 1893, where he started to practice kasina-meditation, in which awareness is directed away from the body. While it leads to a state of calm-abiding, it also leads to visions and out-of-body experiences. He then turned to his keeping awareness of his body at all times, taking full sweeps of the body through a walking meditation practice, which leads to a more satisfactory state of calm-abiding.\n\nDuring this time, Chulalongkorn (1853–1910), the fifth monarch of the Rattanakosin Kingdom, and his brother Prince Wachirayan, initiated a cultural modernization of the entire region. This modernisation included an ongoing campaign to homogenize Buddhism among the villages. Chulalongkorn and Wachiraayan were taught by Western tutors, and held distaste for the more mystical aspects of Buddhism. They abandoned Mongkut's search for the \"noble attainments\", indirectly stating that the noble attainments were no longer possible. In an introduction to the Buddhist monastic code written by Wachirayan, he stated that the rule forbidding monks to make claims to superior attainments was no longer relevant.\n\nDuring this time, the Thai government enacted legislation to group these factions into official monastic fraternities. The monks ordained as part of the Dhammayut reform movement were now part of the Dhammayut order, and all remaining regional monks were grouped together as the Mahanikai order.\n\nAfter his stay at Wat Liap, Ajaan Mun wandered through the Northeast. Ajaan Mun still had visions, when his concentration and mindfulness were lost, but through trial and error he eventually found a method for taming his mind.\n\nAs his mind gained more inner stability, he gradually headed towards Bangkok, consulting his childhood friend Chao Khun Upali on practices pertaining to the development of insight (Pali: \"paññā\", also meaning \"wisdom\" or \"discernment\"). He then left for an unspecified period, staying in caves in Lopburi, before returning to Bangkok one final time to consult with Chao Khun Upali, again pertaining to the practice of paññā.\n\nFeeling confident in his paññā practice he left for Sarika Cave. During his stay there, Ajaan Mun was critically ill for several days. After medicines failed to remedy his illness, Ajaan Mun ceased to take medication and resolved to rely on the power of his Buddhist practice. Ajaan Mun investigated the nature of the mind and this pain, until his illness disappeared, and successfully coped with visions featuring a club-wielding demon apparition who claimed he was the owner of the cave. According to forest tradition accounts, Ajaan Mun attained the noble level of \"non-returner\" (Pali: \"anagami\") after subduing this apparition and working through subsequent visions he encountered in the cave.\n\nAjaan Mun returned to the Northeast to start teaching, which marked the effective beginning of the Kammatthana tradition. He insisted on a scrupulous observance of the \"Vinaya\", the Buddhist monastic code, and of the protocols, the instructions for the daily activities of the monk. He taught that virtue was a matter of the mind, not of rituals, and that intention forms the essence of virtue, not the proper conduct of rituals.\nHe asserted that meditative concentration was necessary on the Buddhist path, and that the practice of jhana and the experience of Nirvana was still possible even in modern times.\n\nAjahn Mun's approach met with resistance from the religious establishment. He challenged the text-based approach of the city-monks, opposing their claims about the non-attainability of \"jhana\" and \"nibbana\" with his own experience-based teachings.\n\nHis report of having reached a noble attainment was met with very mixed reaction among the Thai clergy. The ecclesiastical official Ven. Chao Khun Upali held him in high esteem, which would be a significant factor in the subsequent leeway that state authorities gave to Ajaan Mun and his students. Tisso Uan (1867–1956), who later rose to Thailand's highest ecclesiastical rank of \"somdet\" thoroughly rejected claims to the authenticity of Ajaan Mun's attainment.\n\nTension between the forest tradition and the Thammayut administrative hierarchy escalated in 1926, when Tisso Uan attempted to drive a senior Forest Tradition monk named Ajaan Sing—along with his following of 50 monks and 100 nuns and laypeople — out of Ubon, which was under Tisso Uan's jurisdiction. Ajaan Sing refused, saying he and many of his supporters were born there, and they weren't doing anything to harm anyone. After arguing with district officials the directive was eventually dropped.\n\nIn the late 1930s Tisso Uan formally recognized the Kammatthana monks as a faction. However, even after Ajaan Mun died in 1949, Tisso Uan continued to insist that Ajaan Mun had never been qualified to teach because he hadn't graduated from the government's formal Pali studies courses. \n\nWith the passing of Ajaan Mun in 1949, Ajahn Thate Desaransi was designated the de facto head of the Forest Tradition until his death in 1994. The relationship between the Thammayut ecclesia and the Kammaṭṭhāna monks changed in the 1950s, when Tisso Uan had become ill, and Ajahn Lee went to teach meditation to him to help cope with his illness.\n\nTisso Uan eventually recovered, and a friendship between Tisso Uan and Ajaan Lee began, that would cause Tisso Uan to reverse his opinion of the Kammaṭṭhāna tradition, inviting Ajahn Lee to teach in the city. This event marked a turning point in relations between the Dhammayut administration and the Forest Tradition, and interest continued to grow as a friend of Ajaan Maha Bua's named Nyanasamvara rose to the level of somdet, and later the Sangharaja of Thailand. Additionally, the clergy who had been drafted as teachers from the Fifth Reign onwards were now being displaced by civilian teaching staff, which left the Dhammayut monks with a crisis of identity.\n\nIn the tradition's beginning the founders famously neglected to record their teachings, instead wandering the Thai countryside offering individual instruction to dedicated pupils. However, detailed meditation manuals and treatises on Buddhist doctrine emerged in the late 20th century from Ajahn Mun and Ajahn Sao's first-generation students as the Forest tradition's teachings began to propagate among the urbanities in Bangkok and subsequently take root in the West.\n\nAjahn Lee, one of Ajahn Mun's students, was instrumental in disseminating Mun's teachings to a wider Thai lay audience. Ajahn Lee wrote several books which recorded the doctrinal positions of the forest tradition, and explained broader Buddhist concepts in the Forest Tradition's terms. Ajaan Lee and his students are considered a distinguishable sub-lineage that is sometimes referred to as the \"Chanthaburi Line\". An influential western student in the line of Ajahn Lee is Thanissaro Bhikkhu.\n\nAjahn Chah (1918–1992) was a central person in the popularisation of the Thai Forest Tradition in the west. In contrast to most members of the Forest Tradition he was not a Dhammayut monk, but a Mahanikai monk. He only spent one weekend with Ajaan Mun, but had teachers within the Mahanikai who had more exposure to Ajaan Mun. His connection to the Forest Tradition was publicly recognized by Ajaan Maha Bua. The community that he founded is formally referred to as \"The Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah\".\n\nIn 1967, Ajahn Chah founded Wat Pah Pong. That same year, an American monk from another monastery, Venerable Sumedho (Robert Karr Jackman, later \"Ajahn Sumedho\") came to stay with Ajahn Chah at Wat Pah Pong. He found out about the monastery from one of Ajahn Chah's existing monks who happened to speak \"a little bit of English\". In 1975, Ajahns Chah and Sumedho founded Wat Pah Nanachat, an international forest monastery in Ubon Ratchatani which offers services in English.\n\nIn the 1980s the Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah expanded to the West with the founding of Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in the UK. Ajahn Chah stated that the spread of Communism in Southeast Asia motivated him to establish the Forest Tradition in the West. The Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah has since expanded to cover Canada, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States.\n\nAnother influential student of Ajahn Chah is Jack Kornfield.\n\nWith the passing of Ajaan Thate in 1994, Ajahn Maha Bua was designated the new \"Ajaan Yai\". By this time, the Forest Tradition's authority had been fully routinized, and Ajaan Maha Bua had grown a following of influential conservative-loyalist Bangkok elites. He was introduced to the Queen and King by Somdet Nyanasamvara Suvaddhano (Charoen Khachawat), instructing them how to meditate.\n\nIn recent times, the Forest Tradition has undergone a crisis surrounding the destruction of forests in Thailand. Since the Forest Tradition had gained significant pull from the royal and elite support in Bangkok, the Thai Forestry Bureau decided to deed large tracts of forested land to Forest Monasteries, knowing that the forest monks would preserve the land as a habitat for Buddhist practice. The land surrounding these monasteries have been described as \"forest islands\" surrounded by barren clear-cut area.\n\nIn the midst of the Thai Financial crisis in the late 1990s, Ajaan Maha Bua initiated \"Save Thai Nation\"—a campaign which aimed to raise capital to underwrite the Thai currency. By the year 2000, 3.097 tonnes of gold was collected. By the time of Ajaan Maha Bua's death in 2011, an estimated 12 tonnes of gold had been collected, valued at approximated 500 million USD. 10.2 million dollars of foreign exchange was also donated to the campaign. All proceeds were handed over to the Thai central bank to back the Thai Baht.\n\nThe Thai administration under Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai attempted to thwart the \"Save Thai Nation\" campaign in the late 1990s. This led to Ajaan Maha Bua's striking back with heavy criticism, which is cited as a contributing factor to the ousting of Chuan Leekpai and the election of Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister in 2001. The Dhammayut hierarchy, teaming-up with the Mahanikaya hierarchy and seeing the political influence that Ajaan Maha Bua could wield, felt threatened and began to take action.\n\nIn the late 2000s bankers at the Thai central bank attempted to consolidate the bank's assets and move the proceeds from the \"Save Thai Nation\" campaign into the ordinary accounts which discretionary spending comes out of. The bankers received pressure from Ajaan Maha Bua's supporters which effectively prevented them from doing this. On the subject, Ajaan Maha Bua said that \"it is clear that combining the accounts is like tying the necks of all Thais together and throwing them into the sea; the same as turning the land of the nation upside down.\"\n\nIn addition to Ajaan Maha Bua's activism for Thailand's economy, his monastery is estimated to have donated some 600 million Baht (19 million USD) to charitable causes.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Ajaan Maha Bua was accused of political leanings—first from Chuan Leekpai supporters, and then receiving criticism from the other side after his vehement condemnations of Thaksin Shinawatra.\n\nAjaan Maha Bua was the last of Ajaan Mun's prominent first-generation students. He died in 2011. In his will he requested that all of the donations from his funeral be converted to gold and donated to the Central Bank—an additional 330 million Baht and 78 kilograms of gold.\n\nThe purpose of practice in the tradition is to attain the Deathless (Pali: \"amata-dhamma\"), an absolute, unconditioned dimension of the mind free of inconstancy, suffering, or a sense of self. According to the traditions exposition, awareness of the Deathless is boundless and unconditioned and cannot be conceptualized, and must be arrived at through mental training which includes states of meditative concentration (Pali: \"jhana\"). Forest teachers directly challenge the notion of dry insight, arguing that \"jhana\" is indispensable. The tradition further asserts that the training which leads to the Deathless is not undertaken simply through contentment or letting go, but that the Deathless must be reached by \"exertion and striving,\" sometimes described as a \"battle\" or \"struggle,\" to \"cut\" or \"clear the path\" through the \"tangle\" of defilements that bind the mind to the conditioned world, in order to set awareness free.\n\n\"Kammatthana\", (Pali: meaning “place of work”) refers to the whole of the practice with the goal of ultimately eradicating defilement from the mind.\n\nThe practice which monks in the tradition generally begin with are meditations on what Ajaan Mun called the five \"root meditation themes\": the \"hair of the head\", \"the hair of the body\", the \"nails\", the \"teeth\", and the \"skin\". One of the purposes of meditating on these externally visible aspects of the body is to counter the infatuation with the body, and to develop a sense of dispassion. Of the five, the skin is described as being especially significant. Ajaan Mun writes that \"When we get infatuated with the human body, the skin is what we are infatuated with. When we conceive of the body as being beautiful and attractive, and develop love, desire, and longing for it, it's because of what we conceive of the skin.\"\n\nAdvanced meditations include the classical themes of contemplation and mindfulness of breathing:\n\n\"Mindfulness immersed in the body\" and \"Mindfulness of in-and-out breathing\" are both part of the ten recollections and the four satipatthana, and are commonly given special attention as primary themes for a meditator to focus on.\n\nAjaan Lee pioneered two approaches to breath meditation wherein one focuses on the subtle energies in the body, which Ajaan Lee termed \"breath energies\".\n\nThere are several precept levels: Five Precepts, Eight Precepts, Ten Precepts and the patimokkha. The Five Precepts (\"Pañcaśīla\" in Sanskrit and \"Pañcasīla\" in Pāli) are practiced by laypeople, either for a given period of time or for a lifetime. The Eight Precepts are a more rigorous practice for laypeople. Ten Precepts are the training-rules for sāmaṇeras and sāmaṇerīs (novitiate monks and nuns). The Patimokkha is the basic Theravada code of monastic discipline, consisting of 227 rules for bhikkhus and 311 for nuns bhikkhunis (nuns).\n\nTemporary or short-term ordination is so common in Thailand that men who have never been ordained are sometimes referred to as \"unfinished.\" Long-term or lifetime ordination is deeply respected. The ordination process usually begins as an anagarika, in white robes.\n\nMonks in the tradition are typically addressed as \"Venerable\", alternatively with the Thai Ayya or Taan (for men). Any monk may be addressed as \"bhante\" regardless of seniority.\nFor Sangha elders who have made a significant contribution to their tradition or order, the title \"Luang Por\" (Thai: \"Venerable Father\") may be used.\n\nAccording to \"The Isaan\": \"In Thai culture, it is considered impolite to point the feet toward a monk or a statue in the shrine room of a monastery.\" In Thailand monks are usually greeted by lay people with the \"wai\" gesture, though, according to Thai custom, monks are not supposed to wai laypeople. When making offerings to the monks, it is best not to stand while offering something to a monk who is sitting down.\n\nAll Thai monasteries generally have a morning and evening chant, which usually takes an hour long for each, and each morning and evening chant may be followed by a meditation session, usually around an hour as well.\n\nAt Thai monasteries the monks will go for alms early in the morning, sometimes around 6:00 AM, although monasteries such as Wat Pah Nanachat and Wat Mettavanaram start around 8:00 AM and 8:30 AM, respectively. At Dhammayut monasteries (and some Maha Nikaya forest monasteries, including Wat Pah Nanachat), monks will eat just one meal per day. For young children it is customary for the parent to help them scoop food into monks bowls.\n\nAt Dhammayut monasteries, \"anumodana\" (Pali, \"rejoicing together\") is a chant performed by the monks after a meal to recognize the mornings offerings, as well as the monks' approval for the lay people's choice of generating merit (Pali: \"puñña\") by their generosity towards the Sangha.\n\nDhutanga (meaning \"austere practice\" Thai: Tudong) is a word generally used in the commentaries to refer to the thirteen ascetic practices. In Thai Buddhism it has been adapted to refer to extended periods of wandering in the countryside, where monks will take one or more of these ascetic practices. During these periods monks will live off of whatever is given to them by laypersons they encounter during the trip, and sleep wherever they can. Sometimes monks will bring a large umbrella-tent with attached mosquito netting known as a \"crot\" (also spelled krot, clot, or klod). The crot will usually have a hook on the top so it may be hung on a line tied between two trees.\n\nVassa (in Thai, phansa), is a period of retreat for monastics during the rainy season (from July to October in Thailand). Many young Thai men traditionally ordain for this period, before disrobing and returning to lay life.\n\nWhen Ajaan Mun returned to the Northeast to start teaching, he brought a set of radical ideas, many of which clashed with what scholars in Bangkok were saying at the time:\n\nAjaan Lee emphasized his metaphor of Buddhist practice as a skill, and reintroduced the Buddha's idea of \"skillfulness\"—acting in ways that emerge from having trained the mind and heart. Ajaan Lee said that good and evil both exist naturally in the world, and that the skill of the practice is ferreting out good and evil, or skillfulness from unskillfulness. The idea of \"skill\" refers to a distinction in Asian countries between what is called warrior-knowledge (skills and techniques) and scribe-knowledge (ideas and concepts). Ajaan Lee brought some of his own unique perspectives to Forest Tradition teachings:\n\nAjaan Mun and Ajaan Lee would describe obstacles that commonly occurred in meditation but would not explain how to get through them, forcing students to come up with solutions on their own. Additionally, they were generally very private about their own meditative attainments.\n\nAjaan Maha Bua, on the other hand, saw what he considered to be a lot of strange ideas being taught about meditation in Bangkok in the later decades of the 20th century. For that reason Ajaan Maha Bua decided to vividly describe how each noble attainment is reached, even though doing so indirectly revealed that he was confident he had attained a noble level. Though the Vinaya prohibits a monk from directly revealing ones own or another's attainments to laypeople while that person is still alive, Ajaan Maha Bua wrote in Ajaan Mun's posthumous biography that he was convinced that Ajaan Mun was an arahant. Thanissaro Bhikkhu remarks that this was a significant change of the teaching etiquette within the Forest Tradition.\n\nThe \"mind\" (Pali: \"citta\", \"mano\", used interchangeably as \"heart\" or \"mind\" \"en masse\"), within the context of the Forest Tradition, refers to the most essential aspect of an individual, that carries the responsibility of \"taking on\" or \"knowing\" mental preoccupations. While the activities associated with thinking are often included when talking about the mind, they are considered mental processes separate from this essential knowing nature, which is sometimes termed the \"primal nature of the mind\".\n\nOriginal Mind is considered to be \"radiant\", or \"luminous\" (Pali: \"pabhassara\"). Teachers in the forest tradition assert that the mind is an immutable reality and that the mind is indestructible; the mind simply \"knows and does not die.\" The mind is also a \"fixed-phenomenon\" (Pali: \"thiti-dhamma\"); the mind itself does not \"move\" or follow out after its preoccupations, but rather receives them in place. Since the mind as a phenomenon often eludes attempts to define it, the mind is often simply described in terms of its activities.\n\nAjaan Mun further argued that there is a unique class of \"objectless\" or \"themeless\" consciousness specific to Nirvana, which differs from the consciousness aggregate. Scholars in Bangkok at the time of Ajaan Mun stated that an individual is wholly composed of and defined by the five aggregates, while the Pali Canon states that the aggregates are completely ended during the experience of Nirvana. This presents a logical problem regarding the nature of mind when Nirvana is reached. According to Ajahn Mun, who had experienced that the mind precedes mental fashionings, Ajaan Mun asserted that the mind sheds its attachments to its preoccupations, yet is not itself annihilated during the Nirvana experience, and the mind of one who has attained Nirvana continues.\n\nThe \"twelve nidanas\" describe how, in a continuous process, \"avijja\" (\"ignorance,\" \"unawareness\") leads to the mind preoccupation with its contents and the associated feelings, which arise with sense-contact. This absorption darkens the mind and becomes a \"defilement\" (Pali: \"kilesa\"), which lead to \"craving\" and \"clinging\" (Pali: \"upadana\"). This in turn leads to \"becoming\", which conditions \"birth\". \n\nWhile \"birth\" traditionally is explained as rebirth of a new life, it is also explained in Thai Buddhism as the birth of self-view, which gives rise to renewed clinging and craving.\n\nThe Forest tradition is often cited as having an anti-textual stance, as Forest teachers in the lineage prefer edification through ad-hoc application of Buddhist practices rather than through methodology and comprehensive memorization, and likewise state that the true value of Buddhist teachings is in their ability to be applied to reduce or eradicate defilement from the mind. In the tradition's beginning the founders famously neglected to record their teachings, instead wandering the Thai countryside offering individual instruction to dedicated pupils. However, detailed meditation manuals and treatises on Buddhist doctrine emerged in the late 20th century from Ajahn Mun and Ajahn Sao's first-generation students as the Forest tradition's teachings began to propagate among the urbanities in Bangkok and subsequently take root in the West.\n\nRelated Forest Traditions are also found in other culturally similar Buddhist Asian countries, including the Sri Lankan Forest Tradition of Sri Lanka, the Taungpulu Forest Tradition of Myanmar and a related Lao Forest Tradition in Laos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonasteries\nAbout the Tradition\nDhamma Resources\n"}

With his brother Abu Talib, he took responsibility for the family obligation to provide food and drink for the pilgrims. He also shared joint guardianship of the young Muhammad. It is said that he took Muhammad on a journey to Yemen c.584.\n\nA tradition that Ibn Kathir calls \"weak\" states that he died c.585. This is contradicted by several traditions that indicate that he was still alive many years later.\n\nAz-Zubayr was the founder of the order of chivalry known as the Hilf al-Fudul.

{"id": "2317882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317882", "title": "Teh tarik", "text": "Teh tarik\n\nTeh tarik (literally \"pulled tea\") is a popular hot milk tea beverage most commonly found in restaurants, outdoor stalls and kopitiams within the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. Its name is derived from the pouring process of \"pulling\" the drink during preparation. It is made from a strong brew of black tea blended with condensed milk. It is the national drink of Malaysia.\n\nTeh tarik is formed by two languages: \"Teh\" which means \"tea\" and \"tarik\" which means \"pulled\". The word \"Teh\" for tea originates from Hokkien word 茶 tê for tea, the word \"Tarik\" for pulled originates from Malay.\n\nThe origins of \"teh tarik\" can be traced to Indian Muslim immigrants in the Malay Peninsula who set up drink stalls at the entrance of rubber plantations after World War II to serve the workers there. Since colonial times, \"teh tarik\" has been a popular Malaysian Indian cuisine for many in British Malaya and Singapore. Traditionally, \"teh tarik\" has been seen served with the Roti canai which is a popular breakfast set among Malaysians.\n\nAn element of showmanship exists in the preparation of \"teh tarik\". The ability to drag a long stream of tea above the heads of the patrons without giving them a shower is an amusing novelty for the locals and tourists alike. In Malaysia, there are occasions where \"teh tarik\" brewers gather for competitions and performances to show their skills. \"Teh tarik\" has become recognised along with \"nasi lemak\" as part of the food and beverage heritage of Malaysia by the Malaysian government ministry.\n\nThe mixture is poured back and forth repeatedly between two vessels from a height, giving it a thick frothy top. This process cools the tea to optimal drinking temperatures, thoroughly mixes the tea with the condensed milk, and improves its flavour. This is often compared to the decanting of toddy to enhance its flavour.\n\nLocally and regionally sourced tea used for \"teh tarik\" are not of the highest grade. Despite the strong aroma from the common Ceylonese variety, the taste is rather acrid and generally would not go well with a little cream or fresh milk like other fine tea. Hence condensed milk is used to balance any overpowering taste with its creamy and sweet flavour. \n\nThe term \"kurang manis\", which can be translated to \"less sweet\", is a common request for those who are health conscious or not fond of sugary drinks, as \"teh tarik\" is typically prepared on the sweet side to taste by most vendors.\n\n\n"}

He came to public spotlight in 1980s as a member of VIVA LUDEŽ, trio of young humourists who wrote for humour sections of Split newspapers and magazines like \"Slobodna Dalmacija\", \"Nedjeljna Dalmacija\" and \"Omladinska Iskra\". Those weekly supplements, which would ultimately become \"Feral Tribune\", featured his regular column called \"Bilježnica Robija K.\" (Notebook of Robi K.), in which he gave satirical comments on important social and political events seen through the eyes of an elementary school pupil.\n\nDuring the first years Croatian independence, Ivančić and \"Feral Tribune\" came into conflict with the government of Franjo Tuđman and his Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). In early 1993 \"Slobodna Dalmacija\" was taken over by Miroslav Kutle, a businessman with close ties to Tuđman's right-hand man Gojko Šušak. As a result, \"Feral Tribune\" was removed from the pages of Split daily.\n\nHowever, few months later, \"Feral Tribune\" appeared as bi-weekly, becoming weekly newspaper in December 1993. Viktor Ivančić became its editor-in-chief. During his tenure, the magazine was one of the first to openly criticise the government, expose war crimes committed by Croatian Army, as well as HDZ role in the most controversial aspects of privatisation and other scandals.\n\nIvančić received high praise from his peers for his efforts and received many prestigious journalism awards. Tuđman's government, on the other hand, reacted with the campaign that included controversial pornography taxes, defamation of characters of suits, criminal charges against \"Feral\" staff and economic sabotage through government-friendly businesses. Some of it was directed at Ivančić himself. Soon after receiving public death threat from top HDZ officials, Ivančić was mobilised into Croatian Army on 31 December 1993. He was released from Army - which he served in 4th Guards Brigade - in short time, following series of international protests.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Ivančić ceased to be \"Feral\"s editor-in-chief, but he continued to work in the magazine as columnist. Some of his columns were later published as books. After Feral Tribune ceased to exist in 2008, he join the national weekly newspaper Novosti where he still writes regularly as a columnist.\n\nIn 2017, Ivančić has signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins.\n\n"}

Co-founder of the musical collective Bang on a Can, he was awarded the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Music for \"The Little Match Girl Passion\", which went on to win a 2010 Grammy Award for Best Small Ensemble Performance. He was nominated for an Academy Award for \"Simple Song #3\" from the film \"Youth\".\n\nLang was born in Los Angeles, California. After completing his undergraduate degree at Stanford University, he went to the University of Iowa; he says, \"There was a teacher in composition at the University of Iowa named Martin Jenni, and he had come to Stanford as a leave replacement to teach for a semester. And I just thought he was amazing. He knew a lot of stuff that I'd never heard of before. So when I thought about grad school, I went to Iowa. I was happy I did. It was really a kind of golden age. I really loved it.\" Lang went on to earn a Doctorate of Musical Arts at Yale University in 1989. In addition to Jenni, his teachers have included Henri Lazarof, Lou Harrison, Richard Hervig, Jacob Druckman, Hans Werner Henze, and Martin Bresnick. Together with Julia Wolfe and Michael Gordon, Lang co-founded Bang on a Can in 1987. In 2008 he joined the Yale School of Music composition faculty.\n\nLang has received several awards, including:\n\n\nIn 1999 he collaborated with composers Julia Wolfe and Michael Gordon and librettist/illustrator Ben Katchor on the composition of the \"comic strip opera\" \"The Carbon Copy Building\". The production won an Obie Award for Best New American Production. Lang, Wolfe and Gordon subsequently collaborated with librettist Deborah Artman on the 'oratorio' \"Lost Objects\", the recording of which was released in summer 2001 (Teldec New Line). Their next collaborative project was \"Shelter\", a multi-media work also with librettist Deborah Artman, for the Scandinavian vocal group Trio Mediaeval and the German ensemble musikFabrik, which was performed in Germany and the U.S. in 2005. In 2017 Chinese singer Gong Linna premiered \"Cloud River Mountain,\" written by the three Bang on a Can composers in addition to Lao Luo. They also premiere \"Road Trip,\" a celebration of Bang on a Can's 30-year journey, together at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in October 2017.\n\nAlso in 1999, Lang and playwright Mac Wellman based their opera \"The Difficulty of Crossing a Field\" on a short story by Ambrose Bierce, about an Alabama planter named Williamson who purportedly vanished while walking across a field in 1854.(Bierce's story reoccurs in urban-legend form, in which, coincidentally, the vanished man is often given the name David Lang.)\n\nA piece with multiple choruses and dance, \"battle hymns\" was first performed in Philadelphia in 2009 by the Mendelssohn Club and the Leah Stein Dance Company. Its U.S. west coast premiere was directed by Robert Geary and performed by the San Francisco Choral Society, Volti, the Piedmont Children's Choir, and the Leah Stein Dance Company in April 2013 at the Kezar Pavilion. In May 2014, the Collegiate Chorale and the Manhattan Girls Chorus performed \"battle hymns\" at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. In 2015, the Shenandoah Chorus (Shenandoah University) performed 'battle hymns' at an on-campus concert.\n\nLang was awarded the 2008 Pulitzer Prize in music for his piece \"The Little Match Girl Passion\", composed in 2007. The piece, based on Hans Christian Andersen's fable \"The Little Match Girl\" and inspired by Bach's \"St. Matthew Passion\", was co-commissioned by the Carnegie Hall Corporation and the Perth Theatre and Concert Hall and premiered on October 25, 2007, in Zankel Hall in New York City. Tim Page of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that \"I don't think that I've ever been so moved by a new...composition as I was by David Lang's \"The Little Match Girl Passion\", which is unlike any music I know.\" For the 2017 Metropolitan Museum of Art's annual holiday concert, which has included \"the little match girl passion\" for five years, Lang has written a new version called \"the little match girl (observed)\", in which the audience is the congregation and participates with interstitial hymns.\n\nThe recording of \"The Little Match Girl Passion\" on Harmonia Mundi received a 2010 Grammy Award for Best Small Ensemble Performance.\n\nLang composed this song cycle – a commission from Carnegie Hall and Stanford Lively Arts, premiered at both in late January, 2012 – as a companion piece to \"the little match girl passion\". In that work, death was an implied character; in this follow-up song cycle, death is personified. For the texts sung by the character \"Death,\" Lang turned to the songs of Franz Schubert, from which he made his own translations into English. The part of Death was sung by Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond; the instrumentalists included Bryce Dessner of The National (band) on guitar, Nico Muhly on piano, and Owen Pallett on violin and voice. National Public Radio chose the commercial recording as one of its ten favorite classical albums of 2013.\n\nLang wrote the libretto by typing short, personal phrases into a search engine and writing down the results. The opera includes these anonymous confessions, which are whispered by soprano Tony Arnold, while four instrumentalists from the International Contemporary Ensemble never play above a hush. No audience member can hear the entire opera and it cannot be recorded, so it can only be experienced live.\n\nInspired by the powerful singing he heard from the crowd at an Arsenal F.C. football match, Lang came up with the idea of composing a song for over 1,000 people to sing. The first performance was 9 June 2014 at Birmingham's Millennium Point. Singers were split into groups arranged on the steps of the atrium, each one with a leader with a megaphone. The conductor was Simon Halsey. The lyrics came from Lang doing internet searches for the phrase \"When I am in a crowd I …\" Lang then organised the results into thematic groups.\n\nThe composer surveyed all of the national anthems of the world, drew ideas and phrases from them, and translated them into English. Musically, it is very similar to \"The Little Match Girl Passion\" made up primarily of short, arpeggiated phrases. It is scored for chorus and string quartet. It was premiered on June 7, 2014 at Walt Disney Concert Hall by the Los Angeles Master Chorale, and the recording of the world premiere came out on Cantaloupe Music in the spring of 2016. The Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, where Lang was Composer-in-Residence in 2015-16, performed the Canadian premiere of \"the national anthems,\" Trinity Choir Wall Street performed the New York premiere as part of their Twelfth Night Festival, and the London Symphony Chorus performed the UK premiere.\n\nInspired by the 18th-century practice of public dissections of criminals, \"anatomy theater\", with music by Lang and libretto by Lang and visual artist Mark Dion, premiered at Los Angeles Opera in 2016. It begins with the confession and execution of an English murderess and follows the quest of the anatomist, searching for signs of evil within her body, including an aria for the corpse. The audience was served food and drink and placed in the balcony, to put it in the position of the 18th-century witnesses to the dissection. When the work premiered at LA Opera this June, critics called it a fascinating, grisly, and profound exploration of the nature of evil.\n\nLang's one-act chamber opera for solo baritone is based on Thomas Bernhard's novel, \"The Loser\". Lang first read Bernhard's novel in 1998 and immediately sensed it was something he wanted to set to music. Lang served as composer, librettist and director of \"the loser\". Produced by Bang on a Can, \"the loser\" opened the 2016 BAM Next Wave Festival. Its unusual staging placed the singer Rod Gilfry on a platform above the orchestra seating and at eye level with the theater's balcony. The only other person visible was pianist Conrad Tao, on a platform far behind Gilfry. A small ensemble was heard offstage. The orchestra seating was removed for the production. Lang and \"the loser\" were awarded the 2016 Richard B. Fisher Next Wave Award.\n\nMore than 1,000 musical instruments owned by the School District of Philadelphia cannot be played because they are broken. As part of an ongoing project to repair the broken instruments, in collaboration with Temple Contemporary, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Boyer College of Music and Dance, the Curtis Institute of Music, and the school district, Lang is writing a symphony specifically for the sounds that the instruments make in their broken state. Community members can play in the orchestra or adopt an instrument, and after the performance all the instruments will be fixed and returned to the public schools.\n\nThis opera with the New York Philharmonic received its premiere on June 6, 2019. It is based on \"Fidelio\" by Beethoven and directed by Elkhanah Pulitzer.\n\nHe wrote the arrangements for the Kronos Quartet in \"Requiem for a Dream\", scored the documentary \"The Woodmans,\" and wrote the soundtrack for \"(Untitled)\". In \"(Untitled)\", Lang wrote the score and the music for the main character, a classical composer played by Adam Goldberg. In Lang's 2015 film score, \"Youth\" for Italian director Paolo Sorrentino, he also provided the music for the protagonist, a composer and conductor played by Michael Caine. \"Simple Song #3\", an original song from \"Youth\", was nominated for the 2016 Academy Award, Golden Globe Award and Critics Choice Award for best original song. In Italy, the \"Youth\" score and \"Simple Song #3\" won the David di Donatello awards for Best Score and Best Original Song. Most recently, he is scoring Paul Dano's film \"Wildlife\".\n\nLang's music has been released on the Argo/Decca, BMG, Cantaloupe Music, Chandos, CRI, Naxos Records, Point Music, and Sony Classical labels. His solo albums for Cantaloupe include \"The Passing Measures\" (2001) with the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, \"Child\" (2003) played by Sentieri Selvaggi, and \"Elevated\" (2005) featuring performances by Audrey Riley, A Change of Light, and Lisa Moore.

It is within Havasupai tribal lands.\n\nHavasu Falls is located from Supai. It is the more famous and most visited of the various falls along Havasu Creek. It consists of one main chute that drops over a vertical cliff into a series of plunge pools. High calcium carbonate concentration in the water creates the vivid blue-green color and forms the natural travertine dams that occur in various places near the falls.\n\nDue to the effects of flash floods, the appearance of Havasu Falls and its plunge pools has changed many times. Prior to the flood of 1910, water flowed in a near continuous sheet, and was known as Bridal Veil Falls. The notch through which water flows first appeared in 1910, and has changed several times since. Water currently flows as one stream. In the past, there were sometimes multiple streams, or a continuous flow over the edge.\n\nThere are many picnic tables on the opposite side of the creek, and it is easy to cross over by following the edges of the pools. It is possible to swim behind the falls and enter a small rock shelter behind it. However, drownings have occurred.\nFrom the trail head parking lot, until the Supai Village, there is no access to drinking water. Hikers are advised to bring their own water with them. In the town of Supai, there is a general store and cafe where food and beverage can be purchased.\n\nA campground is located nearby. Visitors are required to reserve permits prior to their travel to the Havasupai Indian Reservation.\n\nHavasu Falls appeared in the 2007 movie \"Next\" starring Nicolas Cage, Julianne Moore, and Jessica Biel.\n\nThe falls also appear in Beyoncé's 2019 music video for \"Spirit\", a song written for the remake of \"The Lion King\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2317900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317900", "title": "The Great Raid", "text": "The Great Raid\n\nThe Great Raid is a 2005 war film about the Raid at Cabanatuan on the island of Luzon, Philippines during World War II. It is directed by John Dahl and stars Benjamin Bratt, James Franco, Connie Nielsen, Marton Csokas, Joseph Fiennes with Motoki Kobayashi and Cesar Montano. The principal photography took place from July 4 to November 6, 2002, but its release was delayed several times from the original target of Fall 2003. The film is adapted from two books, William Breuer's \"The Great Raid on Cabanatuan City\" and Hampton Sides' \"Ghost Soldiers\".\n\nThe film opened in theaters across the United States on August 12, 2005, three days before the 60th anniversary of V-J Day.\n\nThe film showcases the efforts of American soldiers and the Filipino resistance guerrilla, especially a stand at a bridge that delayed Japanese reinforcements. These units fought alongside Americans against Japanese occupiers during the war.\n\nIn 1944, American forces were closing in on the Japanese-occupied Philippines. The Japanese held around 500 American prisoners who had survived the Bataan Death March in a notorious POW camp at Cabanatuan and subjected them to brutal treatment and summary execution, as the Japanese code of bushido viewed surrender as a disgrace. Many prisoners were also stricken with malaria.\n\nThe film opens with the massacre of prisoners of war on Palawan by the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military's secret police (though factually, it was committed by the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army).\n\nMeanwhile, at Lingayen Gulf, the 6th Ranger Battalion under Lt. Col Mucci is ordered by Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger to liberate all of the POWs at Cabanatuan prison camp before they are killed by the Japanese. The film chronicles the efforts of the Rangers, Alamo Scouts from the Sixth Army and Filipino guerrillas as they undertake the Raid at Cabanatuan.\n\nThroughout the film, the viewpoint switches between the POWs at Cabanatuan, the Rangers, the Filipino resistance and the Japanese.\n\nIn particular, the film covers the resistance work undertaken by nurse Margaret Utinsky, who smuggled medicine into the POW camps. The Kempeitai arrested her and sent her to Fort Santiago prison. She was eventually released, but spent six weeks recovering from gangrene as a result of injuries sustained from beatings.\n\nThe Americans used a Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter to divert Japanese attention while the Rangers were crawling toward the camp; the aircraft used in the movie was a Lockheed Hudson, because none of the four surviving P-61s were airworthy when the film was made.\n\nThe movie was filmed in south-east Queensland, Australia utilising a huge, authentic recreation of a prisoner of war camp. In addition, numerous local Asian students were employed to play Japanese soldiers.\n\nThe movie was shot in 2002 but it was pulled from release schedule on several occasions. It was finally released in August 2005, by Miramax Films, which coincided with the formal departure of co-founders Bob and Harvey Weinstein from the company.\n\nJames Franco wrote about the making of the movie in his novel \"Actors Anonymous\".\n\nAs of August 2014, the film had a score of 48 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 29 reviews, and on Rotten Tomatoes, the film had a score of 37% based on 119 reviews. The consensus on Rotten Tomatoes was that the film was too long with too many subplots, although the actual raid was exciting. However, it received more praise from \"Chicago Sun-Times\" critic Roger Ebert, who gave it three stars.\n\nEbert praised the film, saying, \"Here is a war movie that understands how wars are actually fought.\" He continued, \"[The film] has been made with the confidence that the story itself is the point, not the flashy graphics. The raid is outlined for the troops (and for the audience), so that, knowing what the rescuers want to do, we understand how they're trying to do it. Like soldiers on a march, it puts one step in front of another, instead of flying apart into a blizzard of quick cuts and special effects. Like the jazzier but equally realistic \"Black Hawk Down\", it shows a situation that has moved beyond policy and strategy and amounts to soldiers in the field, hoping to hell they get home alive.\" He also said the film gave \"full credit\" to the Filipino guerrillas who assisted the Rangers. He concluded, \"it is good to have a film that is not about entertainment for action fans, but about how wars are won with great difficulty, risk, and cost.\"\n\nWesley Morris of \"The Boston Globe\" criticized a lack of character development and the pace of the film, saying, \"On screen, at least, the raid to free the prisoners isn't all that great - just a bunch of explosions and combat maneuvers. Still, it's the one sequence in the film where everybody works with the same conviction. The audience, meanwhile, has to sit around with the prisoners, waiting for this to happen. It's a long wait.\" He concluded that the film \"amounts to a noble failure.\"\n\nStephen Hunter of \"The Washington Post\" praised the film as \"a riveting, even inspirational account of an American feat of arms about which few know but about which many more should.\" He said the film was made more in the style of movies from the 1940s, with the hero being the unit involved in the action instead of individuals, a technique which is rarely used today and explains the \"essentially starless\" cast drawing mainly from television or film supporting roles. He praised its accuracy, saying, \"The war stuff is first-rate all the way through. A great deal of effort has been made to achieve a level of anthropological correctness: The weapons are right, the uniforms are right, the equipment is right...The raid itself is a dynamo of action filmmaking, exactly like what the real thing must have been -- swift and brutal, with a lot of shooting and no prisoner-taking.\"\n\nJoel Selvin of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" called the film \"very boring\"; a \"story without irony, perspective or any leavening that would make it something other than an ordinary military-action caper. The story line is telegraphed from word one and the meticulous unfolding plot plods ahead inexorably without the slightest bit of suspense.\"\n\nRoger Moore of the \"Orlando Sentinel\" said, \"[The characters are] all real people, and much of this really happened. But director John Dahl (Joy Ride) and the screenwriters have conjured a dreary, old-fashioned 'last roundup' of war movie and prisoner-of-war movie cliches, small but forgivable sins. Less forgivable is how Dahl squanders tension for an hour and a half cutting between the suffering prisoners and resistance intrigues in Manila and the long march of the Rangers, and a fictionalized romance story that might have made a nice little movie by itself.\"\n\nJames Plath of Movie Metropolis wrote, \"In many ways, \"The Great Raid\" adheres to the genre right down to the character types and before-battle thoughts, but it's also a curious combination of modern war tale in the manner of \"Saving Private Ryan\" and the kind of patriotic films that were made in the waning years of the war and in the fifties. It has both a realistic sheen, and an element of idealistic flag-waving. \"The Great Raid\" isn't a perfect film, but it's an engaging one, and, at times, a powerful one.\"\n\nScott Weinberg of DVD Talk gave it a positive review, and described the film as \"truly an 'old-fashioned' war movie...based on, and adhering very closely to, actual events that occurred in early 1945[.] \"The Great Raid\" is not a hyper-kinetic flash-banger like \"Pearl Harbor\", nor it is a cerebral rumination like \"The Thin Red Line\"; it's just a well-hewn and efficient re-telling of true story that's worthy of remembrance.\" He opined that the film was delayed not because it was bad, but because its old-fashioned style is a \"tough sell...in today's marketplace.\"\n\nMike Clark of \"USA Today\" said, \"Just about any golden age Hollywood hack could have made a zestier drama about one of the greatest rescue missions in U.S. military history,\" and criticized \"Franco's droning voice-over\" for spelling out \"every sliver of historical context\", and also said \"a huge chunk of time is given to an uncompelling romance between a major...and a widowed nurse.\"\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" said it \"lacks a center. It's an exhausted sprawl with multiple story foci, none of them terribly compelling,\" concluding, \"Dahl does vividly re-create that least heralded burden of war: the boredom.\"\nSteven Rea of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" wrote, \"\"The Great Raid\", which documents the largest rescue mission in U.S. military history (and ends with archival footage of many of the real soldiers portrayed in the film), lacks the visceral sweep of \"Saving Private Ryan\". But Spielberg's story, for all its gut-wrenching intensity, was a fiction. Dahl's movie, slower in pace and conscious of its own artifice, addresses the same issues of courage and sacrifice - and tells a true story. That's worth something. In fact, it's worth a lot.\"\n\nThe movie was a box office bomb, covering only 12% of its $80 million budget. \"The Great Raid\" was released on August 12, 2005, and opened at #10 at the box office, gathering $3,376,009 in the opening weekend. Its worldwide gross stands at $10,769,311.\n\n"}

The word is a form of the Latin verb \"\"exequi\"\", which denotes \"let it be executed\".\n\nAn exequatur is a patent which a head of state issues to a foreign consul, guaranteeing the consul's rights and privileges of office and ensuring recognition in the state to which the consul is appointed to exercise such powers. If a consul is not appointed by commission, the consul receives no exequatur; the government will usually provide some other means to recognize the consul. The exequatur may be withdrawn, but in practice, where a consul is obnoxious, an opportunity is afforded to his government to recall him.\n\nAn exequatur is a legal instrument issued by secular authorities in Roman Catholic nations to guarantee the legal force of Papal doctrines within the jurisdiction of the secular authority. This custom began during the Western Schism, when the legitimately elected Supreme Pontiff permitted secular leaders to verify the authenticity of Papal decrees before enforcing them.\n\nSome dissidents in the Church claim, however, that the custom arose as an implication of the nature of secular authority over the Church and that such a state privilege to verify Papal doctrine was exercised since the early days of the Church. However, Church doctrine denies that any permission from secular authority is necessary for Papal decrees to be legally effective, even though secular authorities sometimes do not enforce them.\n\nIn Brazilian, French, Luxembourg, Italian, Mexican, and Spanish law, an exequatur is a judgment of a tribunal (in the case of Italy, the Court of Appeal) that a decision issued by a foreign tribunal is to be executed in the jurisdiction of the former, thereby granting authority to the decision of the foreign tribunal as if it issued from the native tribunal.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, an exequatur is a document that validates a court order of a United States civil court as if a court of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico issued it.\n\n"}

She is the lead ship of the \"Radiance\" class, which includes \"Jewel of the Seas\", \"Brilliance of the Seas\" and \"Serenade of the Seas\". All of the \"Radiance\"-class ships have a gas turbine powertrain, which produces higher efficient speeds than other cruise ships, and emissions to the air are much lower than cruise ships powered by diesel engines.\n\nBuilt in 1998, the ship cost Royal Caribbean International about 338 million dollars to build. The ship is considered to be one of the more environmentally-friendly but less fuel-efficient. As one of the Radiance Class ships it contained more glass than any other Royal Caribbean ship when it was launched. It has over 700 balcony staterooms, a two level main dining room and a retractable glass roof over the solarium (adults-only) pool.\n\n\"Radiance of the Seas\" was designed in Germany by Meyer Werft to cruise varied climates. The ship is faster than most cruise ships and has the ability to maneuver with the combination of the Azipod propulsion system, the powerful bow thrusters, and the dynamic positioning system. The ship is economically efficient through the design of the power plant consisting of two gas turbines and one steam turbine. The waste heat from each gas turbine is fed through a heat recovery steam generator, thus using the steam to power the steam turbine. Once electricity is generated from this power plant it then powers the external propulsion pods and thrusters.\n\nThe ship has many unique features, including a $6 million art collection and gyroscopically-stabilized pool tables. Royal Caribbean ships all include art in passenger areas; \"Radiance of the Seas\" has displayed art from over 100 artists around the world.\n\n\"Radiance of the Seas\" is the first cruise ship to feature pool tables that are stabilized by a computer-controlled gyroscope. They adjust with the motion of the ship to keep the table-top level with the horizon. The vessel has the most glass of any Royal Caribbean ship. She has 10 dining choices, a rock-climbing wall, a mini-golf course, pools, and a water slide.\n\nDuring the northern summer season, \"Radiance of the Seas\" operates in Alaska. When the ship is cruising in Alaska guests are able to stand on the helipad to enjoy picturesque views of the glaciers passing by the ship as they cruise along. In spring and fall, she visits the Hawaiian Islands, and in the winter season, the southern summer, she visits Australia and New Zealand. The inaugural Australian cruise of the performing arts on the \"Radiance of the Seas\" in November 2014 included, among others, Cheryl Barker, David Hobson, Teddy Tahu Rhodes, Simon Tedeschi, Elaine Paige, Marina Prior, and John Waters.\n\nThe ship was ordered to leave Sydney by the New South Wales police under \"Operation Nemesis\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic]. It was provisioned in Sydney on 3 April and left port without passengers on 4 April towards Singapore.\n\n"}

In 1863, Ewart conceived the idea of a Blue plaque to commemorate a link between a location and a famous person or event, serving as a historical marker. It is the oldest such scheme in the world.\n\nEwart was born in Liverpool on 1 May 1798. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, gaining the Newdigate prize for English verse. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1827, and the next year entered Parliament for the borough of Bletchingley in Surrey, serving until 1830.

The boom was grappled by the Canadarm and served as an extension of the arm, doubling its length to a combined total of 100 feet (30 m). At the far end of the boom was an instrumentation package of cameras and lasers used to scan the leading edges of the wings, the nose cap, and the crew compartment after each lift-off and before each landing. If flight engineers suspected potential damage to other areas, as evidenced in imagery captured during lift-off or the rendezvous pitch maneuver, then additional regions could be scanned.\n\nThe OBSS was introduced to the shuttle fleet with STS-114, the \"Return to Flight\" mission executed by \"Discovery\", and was flown on every mission after that until the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2011. It was used to inspect the shuttle for damage to the heat shield, officially called the Thermal Protection System (TPS), that could jeopardize the shuttle during re-entry. The decision to perform focused inspections of the TPS was prompted by the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" disaster, in which \"Columbia\" was destroyed due to damage inflicted to its TPS during lift-off. The OBSS was central to focused inspections of the TPS, not only because it carried all the instruments necessary for detailed measurements and observations, but also because without it, the Canadarm was too short to reach to all the areas that needed to be surveyed.\n\nThe boom was essentially the same design as the Canadarm itself, except that the articulatory joints are fixed. OBSS arms for the three remaining orbiters were manufactured relatively quickly, primarily because some spare parts for the Canadarm system were used.\n\nTwo instrumentation packages are installed at the far end of the OBSS. Sensor package 1 consists of the Laser Dynamic Range Imager (LDRI) and an Intensified Television Camera (ITVC). Sensor package 2 is the Laser Camera System (LCS) and a digital camera (IDC). The sensors can record at a resolution of a few millimeters, and can scan at a rate of about per second.\n\nIt is also fitted with handrails, so that the boom could be used to provide spacewalkers with access to the shuttle's underbelly in case in-flight repairs were required.\n\nDuring STS-120 the OBSS was used as an extension boom for the space station's Canadarm2, something it was never designed to do. During this mission the P6 solar array had become damaged during the redeploy. Canadarm2 grabbed the arm on its center Flight-Releasable Grapple Fixture and then astronaut Scott E. Parazynski was mounted at the end of the boom to make the repair. Because Canadarm2 was unable to power the OBSS, it was without power many hours more than it was designed to handle, but because it was heated up considerably before the start of the repair it stayed undamaged.\n\nDue to the benefits for spacewalkers from the extended range provided by connecting an OBSS to the International Space Station (ISS)'s robotic arm, NASA implemented a plan for STS-134 to leave its OBSS behind on the ISS, where it would permanently remain. The plan resulted in a number of modifications to the OBSS, now known as the Enhanced ISS Boom Assembly, including the addition of a Power Data and Grapple Fixture which enables mating to the robotic arm on the end of the boom with a Canadarm2-compatible grapple fixture to favor station use. The boom was stowed on the ISS S1 Integrated Truss Structure on the fourth spacewalk of STS-134 on May 27, 2011. The OBSS sensors were disconnected during the EVA, and are not designed to withstand thermal conditions outside the ISS without power to keep them warm. However, the modification of the grapple fixture could enable such equipment to be mounted onto the OBSS in the future.\n\n"}
{"id": "2317947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317947", "title": "Debabrata Biswas", "text": "Debabrata Biswas\n\nDebabrata Biswas (also known as George Biswas and George-\"da\"; 22 August 1911 – 18 August 1980), was an Indian Rabindra Sangeet singer.\n\nBiswas was born in 1911 in Barisal and then later came to Kishoreganj of Mymensingh district of British colonial undivided Bengal province of India. It was the time when King George V was visiting India for the Delhi Durbar, so he was nicknamed \"George\". He was popularly called \"George Biswas\" and \"George Da\".\n\nBiswas' music was notable for its exceptional depth of emotional expression combined with an exploration of the subtle dramatic element in Tagore's lyrics. His early gramophone recordings of Tagore songs brought out in the early 1940s demonstrate soulful full-throated expression of melody with a strict adherence to the rules and norms of tradition, written and unwritten, which he felt obliged to break in the early 1960s – considered by most to be his heyday up to the year 1969. His renderings in this period show amazing power of voice and modulation, compounded with an overt emotional expression of a kind hitherto unpractised by his contemporaries and even himself. His voice at this period ranged at ease within the three octaves and with varied tempos and rhythms and showed a greater variety of emotional expression from the thunderous and rumbling to the soft and mellow. Somewhat audacious and overpowering in his personal feelings and mores, his enunciation of the words of even the most familiar of Tagore's lyrics extracted new meanings and freshness from the compositions. Some of his renditions that go deep into the heart of Bengalis include Akash bhora surjo tara, Purano sei diner kotha, E monihar amay nahi saje, Klanti amar khoma koro probhu, Je ratey mor duarguli, Tomar kache e bor magi, Chokher joler laglo joar, Swapne amar mone holo, among others.\n\nBiswas is the only singer who sang Rabindra Sangeet in Sanskrit, English, German, French, and Russian. He got trained at Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Kolkata for learning the rudiments of foreign languages.\n\nFilmmaker Ritwik Ghatak took help of Biswas for song selection & playback of Tagore songs. Those Tagore songs used in the movies became extremely popular among the masses. \nDebabrata Biswas was actively engaged with IPTA group for a long period. He sang a few songs set to music by Salil Choudhury, Hemanga Biswas, Jyotirindra Moitra and recorded songs during the liberation movement of Bangladesh. Kazi Nazrul Islam himself was the trainer when Debabrata recorded songs by Nazrul.\n\nAuthoritarian eyebrows started to be raised from 1964 onwards with the liberties he started taking by challenging the published tune-notations, scansion, traditional tempo, beat and rhythms which people were accustomed to associating with Tagore lyrics, as well as with his inclination towards the use of Western musical instruments for the purposes of accompaniment and interlude – an obsession that remained with him till his death. He challenged the sensibilities of Tagore song listeners with the use of the Spanish guitar, the saxophone, the clarinet, the piano and the cello along with the sitar, the sarod, the esraj and the violin; and all this in the name of 'interpretation' and 'freedom of expression'. His popularity swelled beyond bounds with the masses, young and old – connoisseurs and dilettante alike for, despite these excesses, the power and intrinsic purity of style and spirit of his renditions were unparalleled.\n\nIn the later part of the 1960s, Debabrata was seriously challenged by the authorities over his audacious style and quite a number of his records were prohibited from commercial production for reasons attributed to wrong spirit, wrong tempo and other melodic excesses not regarded as harmonious to the purity of Tagore compositions. Although initially he did brace himself to meet the challenge, he retreated later and on his own volition stopped all record production. As further controversy fuelled, his public live performances continued with an ever- increasing demand but with age (now he was 60) and a declining voice and his lifelong asthma affliction, he withdrew from public appearance, venting his anguish and frustrations in his autobiographical reflections : \"Bratya Janer Ruddha Sangit\" (or \"The Stifled Music of an Untouchable\"), published in 1979, a year before his death on 18 August 1980.\n\nA bachelor, a teetotaller, an excellent cook, a visitor to the Royal Calcutta Turf Club, a traditionalist at heart yet posing as a bohemian in a tongue-in-cheek style, and by any standards an eccentric, he lived a simple, modest and spartan life at his rented flat in South Calcutta, retiring in 1971 from the Life Insurance Corporation of India where he held a clerical position throughout his tenure; this, despite his being a post-graduate in economics from the Calcutta University. A confirmed communist throughout his life, he held his party membership with the Communist Party of India till the mid-1950s. However, he was hurt at the fact that a conflict had arisen among the core groups of the Communist Party itself. Hence, when Communist Party of India (Marxist) was formed, he was in a confused state. However, he remained in touch with the communist party till his death. In one of his memoirs he has said: \"When the party got divided into two sections, I was confused, because I was attached to the members of both, Communist Party of India or CPI, as well as the newly formed Communist Party of India (Marxist). So, I decided to remain away from active politics. However, I must confess that I have been lucky to get the true love of all the members of both the wings of the communist party all through my life.\"\n\nApart from Rabindrasangeet, he is known to have held the masses spellbound with his booming and baritone voice singing \"Ganasangit\" or Peoples' Songs in party gatherings, meetings and plenary sessions up to the mid-1950s. He remains one of the towering personalities of the peak era of Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), as a cultural delegate of which he visited China twice in the early 1950s with other great cultural luminaries from India. He recorded his experiences with China in a well-written but somewhat simplistic and naive book titled \"Antaranga Chin\" or \"China of My Heart\".\n\nA broad-hearted man of caustic humour even to the point of self-mockery, buffoonery and feigned frivolity, he was fond of sketching and often gave drawings along with autographs. One such signature features himself praying to Tagore and another showing Tagore hitting a sixer with a cricket bat. Immensely popular as he was, he had shunned the press and the media all his life, not even allowing his own photographs or career history on blurbs or record covers.\n\nHe lent his voice to a number of films and after his death was the subject of a documentary film by his name, based on archival footage and interviews.\n\nTo this day, he remains the most popular exponent of the art of \"Rabindra Sangeet\", a model of orthodoxy when orthodox, and an icon of protest against the establishment, organized media and cultural dictatorship when breaking away from the orthodox. Even after 40 years from his passing away, his popularity remains supreme cutting across fan base.\n"}

The evection, formerly called the moon's second anomaly, was approximately known in ancient times, and its discovery is attributed to Ptolemy. The current name itself dates much more recently, from the 17th century: it was coined by Bullialdus in connection with his own theory of the Moon's motion.\n\nEvection causes the Moon's ecliptic longitude to vary by approximately ± 1.274° (degrees), with a period of about 31.8 days. The evection in longitude is given by the expression formula_1, where formula_2 is the mean angular distance of the Moon from the Sun (its \"elongation\"), and formula_3 is the moon's mean angular distance of the moon from its perigee (\"mean anomaly\").\n\nIt arises from an approximately six-monthly periodic variation of the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit and a libration of similar period in the position of the Moon's perigee, caused by the action of the Sun.\n\nThe evection opposes the Moon's equation of the center at the new and full moons, and augments the equation of the center at the Moon's quarters. This can be seen from the combination of the principal term of the equation of the center with the evection: formula_4\n\nAt new and full moons, D=0° or 180°, 2D is effectively zero in either case, and the combined expression reduces to formula_5\n\nAt the quarters, D=90° or 270°, 2D is effectively 180° in either case, changing the sign of the expression for the evection, so that the combined expression then reduces to formula_6 .\n\n"}

He is the youngest member of the sibling musical group the Osmonds. As a solo artist, Osmond has accumulated six gold records, one platinum record, and two gold albums.\n\nOsmond was born in Canoga Park, California, the ninth and youngest child of Olive May (née Davis; 1925–2004) and George Virl Osmond (1917–2007). His siblings are Virl, Tom, Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Jay, Donny, and Marie Osmond. He is also the only Osmond of the nine not to have been born in the family's hometown of Ogden, Utah.\n\nGrowing up, Osmond was taught by tutors to accommodate his professional life.\n\nHe received his first gold record at age five for a song he recorded in Japanese, \"My Little Darling\". He was the first Osmond to achieve this.\n\nHis recording of \"Long Haired Lover from Liverpool\" in 1972 resulted in \"The Guinness Book of World Records\" designating him the youngest performer to have a #1 single on the UK Singles Chart. The song was credited to \"Little Jimmy Osmond\". In Japan, he had the moniker \"Jimmy Boy.\"\n\nIn 1978, Osmond starred in the feature film \"The Great Brain\". He starred in other acting roles as well, including two episodes of the TV series \"Fame\". He performed on stage and television often with his older siblings.\n\nIn 1985, he met Latino impresario Manuel Montoya at A&M Records, and this led to his only Spanish recording, \"Siempre Tu\". He toured Latin US markets, including Puerto Rico, Mexico, Venezuela and Chile.\n\nThe 2012 Osmonds album \"I Can't Get There Without You\" was performed with Jimmy Osmond on lead vocals; it was the first album to feature Jimmy as lead singer, as older brother Merrill Osmond historically held that role in the band. In live performances, Jimmy often serves as a co-lead singer with Merrill, a role previously held by Donny during the band's heyday in the early 1970s.\n\nJimmy Osmond is president of Osmond Entertainment. He has developed and supervised most of the Osmonds' merchandising business, as well as producing hundreds of hours of programming for networks including ABC, PBS, the BBC and the Disney Channel.\n\nHe has also featured in musical theater. Like his brother Donny many years earlier, he starred in \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\". He also starred in \"Boogie Nights\" in 2004 at the Grand Theatre, Blackpool.

Along with consulates in Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, and Naha, the Embassy provides assistance to American citizens and residents who live in Japan and issues visas to Japanese nationals, and legal residents in Japan who wish to visit or immigrate to the United States.\n\nWilliam F. Hagerty, the current Ambassador to Japan, was sworn in on July 27, 2017.\n\nJoseph M. Young became Deputy Chief of Mission, U.S. Embassy Tokyo in July 2017. \n\nThe current embassy building was designed by César Pelli and Norma Merrick Sklarek, and completed in 1976. It succeeded the previous embassy building built on the same property in 1931 by Harold Van Buren Magonigle and Antonin Raymond. \n\nThe Ambassador's official residence, built together with the then new embassy in 1931, was one of the first buildings specifically built by the US as an Ambassador's residence. It served as the historic meeting place between Emperor Hirohito and General Douglas MacArthur in 1945. \n\nIn January 2001, the U.S. Department of State authorized the Residence of the U.S. Ambassador to Japan to be labeled an important cultural asset. \n\nThe embassy is located in the Akasaka neighborhood of Minato, Tokyo, steps away from the Nagatachō district, home of the Japanese legislature and the Prime Minister's residence. The address is 1-10-5, Akasaka, Minato-ku Post Code: 107-8420.

Gyokusen-ji is also the location of a small number of foreign graves dating from as early as 1854 marking the final resting place of US forces personnel that died while serving as part of Commodore Matthew Perry's 'Black Ship' fleet. \n\nHarris negotiated the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the two countries, which was signed at nearby Ryōsen-ji in 1858.\n\nThe United States established its first legation in Tokyo in 1859 under Townsend Harris. This legation was located at Zenpukuji, a Buddhist temple in the Motoazabu neighborhood of southern Tokyo.\n\nIn 1875, the legation was moved to a site on the Sumida River near Tsukiji, in an area slated as a district for foreigners outside the employ of the Japanese government; this site is now occupied by the St. Luke's Garden complex.\n\nThe legation moved to the current embassy site in 1890.\n\nIn January 1906, following Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan and the U.S. mutually elevated their legates to the rank of ambassador. Several European powers did so at the same time, indicating a perception of equality between Japan and the major Western powers.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy was closed shortly following the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941. Its American employees (including military attaches) were interned on the embassy grounds until June 1942, when they were sent by ship to Portuguese East Africa and handed over for repatriation. Simultaneously, Japanese diplomats who had been in U.S. were handed over for repatriation. \n\nThe U.S. Embassy remained closed during the Allied occupation, as the U.S. was the occupying power in Japan. Following restoration of diplomatic relations under the Treaty of San Francisco, the U.S. Embassy reopened on April 28, 1952. Robert D. Murphy arrived to serve as the American ambassador. The Embassy of Japan in Washington, D.C. also reopened on the same day.\n\nThe land on which the embassy sits is about 13,000 m² (3.21 acres), and has been leased from the Japanese government since 1896. In 2005, it was reported that the US government had made no payments for the embassy's premises since 1998 after failing to agree on a renewal of the lease agreement. In 2007, the two governments agreed to renew the lease through 2027, following which the US government paid its unpaid rent. The annual rent for the underlying land was set at 7 million yen for 1998-2007, 10 million yen for 2008-12, and 15 million yen for 2013-27. The very low rent amount for the land is due to the age of the lease agreement, and the fact that it originally contained no escalation or adjustment provisions.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on October 4, 1999, in the United Kingdom and on February 29, 2000, in the United States. Produced by Jimmy Pop and Richard Gavalis, it is the band's second release with Geffen Records after \"One Fierce Beer Coaster\" (1996). This was the second and last album to feature drummer Spanky G, who left the band to finish his studies.\n\nThe album was a commercial success that generated favorable reviews and brought the Bloodhound Gang into the mainstream consciousness. In the US, it initially debuted at number two on the Top Heatseekers chart, but peaked at number 14 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. However, the album reached number one in Australia, Austria, and Germany. \n\nFive singles were released from the album: \"Along Comes Mary\", \"The Bad Touch\", \"The Ballad of Chasey Lain\", \"Mope\", and \"The Inevitable Return of the Great White Dope\". \"The Bad Touch\" was listed on 14 different charts worldwide, and reached number one on five of them.\n\nIn March 1995, the Bloodhound Gang signed a record deal with Columbia Records and released their debut studio album, \"Use Your Fingers\", that July, but were subsequently dropped by the label. After adjusting its lineup, the group began working on their second album, \"One Fierce Beer Coaster\".\n\nReleased on December 3, 1996, it eventually sold over 500,000 copies in the US. The album's first single, \"Fire Water Burn\", played a major role in the slow build of interest that ultimately led to the band's mainstream breakthrough. Geffen Records signed the band within two months as word-of-mouth praise for the album spread.\n\nThe album, reminiscent of the band's first album, features various skits in between songs. The first of these skits, entitled \"Mama's Boy\" is an impromptu phone conversation between Jimmy Pop and his mother. \"R.S.V.P.\" features a short monologue from Vivid pornstar Chasey Lain. \"That Cough Came With a Prize\" is 15 seconds of coughing. \"This Is Stupid\" is an arbitrary track performed by the vocal duo who feature in \"Right Turn Clyde.\" Finally, \"The Ten Coolest Things About New Jersey\" is simply ten seconds of silence. According to the liner notes, Jimmy Pop had to explain the track to band member DJ Q-Ball.\n\n\"A Lap Dance Is So Much Better When the Stripper Is Crying\" is a parody of the narrative of Red Sovine's \"trucker songs\".\n\n\"Right Turn Clyde\" features a chorus parodying Pink Floyd's hit single \"Another Brick in the Wall Part II\"; \"All in all you're just another dick with no balls.\" Because of the issue, the album was delayed in the US. It was eventually resolved and the album was finally released in the US. In Europe, the album was initially released without the song or \"Take the Long Way Home\", thus containing only 45 CD tracks. Later pressings featured the complete track list. The original version of \"Take the Long Way Home\", containing samples of someone saying \"May I have your attention please? May I have your attention please?\" before the verses and \"That's enough. I said that's enough!\" at the end of the song, can be heard on the 1999 acetate CD and a 2016 CD reissue of the album. Australian editions of the album only ever contained 45 tracks – the album was never reissued there with the complete track list, however in recent years, US imports with the complete track list have been available for sale in Australian shops.\n\nA \"clean\" version of the CD was released titled simply \"Hooray\". It featured an alternative cover image of a cow's udder.\n\nThe track \"The Inevitable Return of the Great White Dope\" appeared on the \"Scary Movie\" soundtrack.\n\nThe track \"Magna Cum Nada\" appeared in the movie \"Loser\".\n\nA double vinyl version of the album, with the American track listing, was released in 2000 and is currently out of print. A new single vinyl release, on blue vinyl and with the original European track list, was released on 22 July 2016. Neither vinyl release includes the hidden track. A third reissue was announced for 28 February 2020 as a double album, with \"Take the Long Way Home\" and \"Right Turn Clyde\", on transparent vinyl.\n\n\"Hooray for Boobies\" received generally positive reviews. Many reviewers complimented the album's duncical, but ultimately enjoyable, humor. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas wrote, \"on one hand, it's easy to hate the Bloodhound Gang. [...] On the other hand, you almost have to admire the lengths that they go to be, well, defiantly stupid.\" Many reviewers also complimented the album's eccentric plunderphonic-esque approach to music. \"PopMatters\" reviewer Patrick Schabe compared the Bloodhound Gang to Beck, saying, \"if anomalous characterization, synthesis, and a popular culture repertoire make Beck the big brother of postmodern music, then surely he’s part of a family? If so, then perhaps the Bloodhound Gang are the snotty, juvenile, teenage brother in that family.\"\n\nNot all reviews were complimentary. Many critics criticized the band for its heavy use of outdated music and its toilet- and sex-based humor. \"Entertainment Weekly\" writer Doug Brod decried the album, saying \"on Hooray for Boobies these knuckleheads tap into '80s-style metal and New Orderish dance-wave to back their dumbbell odes to oral sex, porn stars, revenge, and – did I mention oral sex?\"\n\n\"Hooray for Boobies\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 19 on March 18, 2000.

{"id": "2318009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318009", "title": "Saint Malo, Louisiana", "text": "Saint Malo, Louisiana\n\nSaint Malo () was a small fishing village that existed along the shore of Lake Borgne in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana as early as the mid-eighteenth century until it was destroyed by the 1915 New Orleans hurricane. Located along Bayou Saint Malo, about east of the Isleño fishing village of Shell Beach, it was the first permanent settlement of Filipinos and perhaps the first Asian-American settlement in the United States.\n\nThe exact date of the establishment of Saint Malo is disputed. The settlement may have been formed as early as 1763 or 1765 by Filipino deserters of the Spanish Manila galleon trade. The members of the community were commonly referred to as \"Manila men,\" or \"Manilamen,\" and later \"Tagalas\". \n\nOral tradition states that the fisherman of Saint Malo witnessed the British invasion of Louisiana leading up to the Battle of New Orleans and joined the Baratarians under Jean Lafitte in the defense of New Orleans.\n\nSmall communities of criminals, fugitive slaves, and Filipinos commonly found refuge along Lake Borgne in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The settlement of Saint Malo was established, by some accounts, as early as 1763 by Filipinos who deserted Spanish ships during the Manila galleon trade. It is also possible that the community was established later into the early nineteenth century. The Manilamen settled in the marshlands of Louisiana where no Spanish officials could reach them. Reasons for their desertion varied; however their desire to escape brutalities dealt by the Spanish is generally regarded as the main reason. \n\nBeginning in 1784, Juan San Maló () led a group of maroons () below New Orleans and in St. Bernard Parish which stole livestock, destroyed property, and seeded other chaos. In May of that year, the Spanish government began preparing for an expedition to capture San Maló and his maroons after a group of Americans were murdered. San Maló retreated with his group to live in the extensive marshland surrounding Lake Borgne, but Spanish forces led by Francisco Bouligny eventually captured him along with sixty maroons. On June 19, 1784, he was hanged in Jackson Square.\n\nThe same area that San Maló and his group found refuge became known by his name. It wasn't until March 31, 1883 that the journalist Lafcadio Hearn published an article in \"Harper's Weekly\" which documented the community firsthand. The article is the first published article about the Filipinos in the United States.\n\nSaint Malo was completely destroyed, along with much of the region, by the New Orleans hurricane of 1915 and consequently the remnants of the community assimilated into New Orleans.\n\nAccording to oral tradition, the Manilamen of Saint Malo took part in the Battle of New Orleans by joining privateer Jean Lafitte to assist Major General Andrew Jackson. Historian Marina Espina states that the defending American force under Jackson consisted of \"regular army troops, state militia, western sharpshooters, two regiments and pirates from the Delta Swamps.\" \n\nConversely, Major Arsène Lacarrière Latour mentioned in his memoirs that Filipinos had guided British forces through the marshland to the Mississippi River.\n\nThe Manilamen lived in small houses supported above the water by stilts in a similar style to the nipa huts of the Philippines. Wood needed to construct dwellings had to be acquired elsewhere as it could not be easily found in the swamps. The palmetto and woven-cane construction often did not withstand the harsh climate of marsh and had to be repaired or replaced frequently. Windows were draped with netting to protect from mosquitoes and other biting insects. Dwellings lacked furniture including tables, chairs, and bed frames. Mattresses were stuffed with dried Spanish moss which had been a common practice in the region and had even been used to upholster the Ford Model T. The mattresses were laid upon a series of shelves mounted against the walls. According to Hearn, the fishermen slept at night “among barrels of flour and folded sails and smoked fish.”\n\nThe diet of the community consisted mainly of seafood, principally raw fish with oil and vinegar. Fish was also smoked and hung for later consumption. Chickens and pigs were raised among the dwellings, and depictions illustrated small gardens along the walkways and porches.\n\nThe Manilamen of Saint Malo were entirely devoted a subsistence lifestyle based upon fishing and trapping. Rarely did women live in the village. In fact, there were no women in the community during Hearn's visit. If fisherman did have families, they often lived in New Orleans and its environs. The reason for this can be attributed to the isolated and harsh conditions of the settlement. Manilamen often courted and married Isleño, Cajun, and American Indian women. When it was possible, Manilamen sent profits made from fishing to acquaintances in Manila so that it may be delivered to their families.\n\nDue to the isolation of Saint Malo, the Manilamen paid no taxes and the community lacked law enforcement officials. The village had never been visited by any official from St. Bernard Parish, the state of Louisiana, or the United States government. As a result, the community governed itself. In extreme cases, the eldest man of the community would consider disputes and mediate over the situation. In the rare case that a given verdict is not accepted, the individual was imprisoned in a “fish-car,” which was a makeshift prison cell. The offender generally accepted the terms given to him due to the harsh physical conditions, lack of food, and/or rising tide.\n\nThe predominant religion of the Manilamen was Roman Catholicism. Priests rarely went to visit the settlement due to its isolation.\n\nSome descendants of these Filipinos continue to live in Louisiana today as multiracial Americans. A number of Isleños and their descendants possess Filipino ancestry, so much so that Los Isleños Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard lists \"Filipino\" as a significant community that developed the Isleño identity.\n\nIn November 2019, a historical marker for the settlement was installed at Los Isleños Museum Complex.\n\n"}

He was the drummer for the seminal Minneapolis alternative-rock band The Replacements from 1979 to 1990, and then he joined the informal supergroup Golden Smog before beginning a solo career. Mars more or less left music behind in the late '90s in order to concentrate on his artwork.\n\nIn \"Rolling Stone's Alt Rock-a-Rama\", Mars detailed the kind of hell-raising that he and the other Replacements—singer-guitarist Paul Westerberg, lead guitarist Bob Stinson, and bassist Tommy Stinson—indulged in when they were together. Among other incidents, Mars was thrown in jail for playing chicken with an unmarked police car. Also, in conjunction with Bob Stinson, he sabotaged a gig where he knew there would be a lot of record-industry personnel in attendance by going to a novelty store and purchasing some bottles of stink juice. Mars sometimes transformed into an alter ego named Papi the Clown while on tour; he would paint his face when inebriated and spook the band and road crew.\n\nMars appeared on only a few songs on the Replacements' final album, \"All Shook Down\" (1990), and left before the subsequent tour, unhappy with Westerberg's increasing control of the band.\n\nMars's first solo album, \"Horseshoes and Hand Grenades\" (1992), was a revelation for fans and critics used to his fairly limited role in The Replacements. He wrote every track and played drums, guitar, and keyboards in addition to handling all lead and backing vocals. Except for the presence of bass guitarist J.D. Foster and brief contributions from Soul Asylum's Dave Pirner and Dan Murphy, it was essentially a D.I.Y. affair. Mars followed it up a year later with \"75% Less Fat\".\n\nMars wasn't interested in touring behind his third album, \"Tenterhooks\" (1995), so another band, The Wallmen, toured behind it with a cardboard cutout of Mars placed onstage. He released one more album, \"Anonymous Botch\" (1996), before fully turning his attention to his visual-art career.\n\nMars self-published a fifth album, \"Note to Self\", in 2017. He announced the news on Twitter and later on his Facebook page.\n\nHis painting style, examples of which grace all of his album covers, is marked by nightmarish landscapes and grotesque, distorted figures. He draws inspiration from his older brother's struggle with schizophrenia.\n\nHe generally likes to use oils or pastels, although he ventures into other media, like acrylic and scratchboard. He created a 13-minute animated film about his work titled \"The Severed Stream\".\n\nHis work, which has fetched prices of more than $30,000, has been shown throughout the United States and Canada. He has had solo exhibitions at Billy Shire Fine Arts, The Erie Art Museum, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, The Steensland Museum, Coker Bell Gallery and the Mesa Arts Center.\n\nMars lives in Minneapolis with his wife, Sally Mars.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1873 and offers undergraduate and graduate degrees through seven colleges and schools. In the fall of 2016, it enrolled 1,817 students. The main academic and residential campus is located northwest of Atlanta, Georgia in Rome. There are adult education and graduate programs at distance learning facilities in North Atlanta and Rome. In addition Shorter operates the Robert H. Ledbetter College of Business and the School of Nursing at off-campus facilities in the Rome area.\n\nFielding athletic teams known as the Shorter Hawks, the university became a provisional member of NCAA Division II, and the Gulf South Conference in July, 2013. The official school and athletic colors are blue and white. The majority of Shorter's students are from Georgia, with only 6% of student enrollment coming from out-of-state and an additional 3% as international students. The university offers many extracurricular activities to its students, including athletics, honor societies, clubs and student organizations, as well as fraternities and sororities.\n\nShorter University was founded in 1873 by Luther Rice Gwaltney, pastor of the Rome Baptist Church, as a women's college known as the Cherokee Baptist Female College. The college was renamed in 1877 to Shorter Female College because of the financial contributions of Alfred and Martha Shorter. Shorter was located in Victorian-style buildings on Shelton Hill near downtown Rome and educated young women at primary, preparatory and collegiate levels. Classes were held Tuesdays through Saturdays and early curriculum included science, music, art, drama and literary works. Through additional contributions from the J.L. Bass and J.P. Cooper families, the university was relocated to its current site just outside Rome in 1910. During the 1920s the college constructed the first indoor swimming pool in the United States and swimming became a physical education graduation requirement. The era also included the first women were selected for the Board of Trustees. During the 1920s Shorter became an accredited member in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, in which the university holds accreditation.\n\nThrough the years of the college struggled with financial problems during the 1930s with the Great Depression and World War II in the 1940s, Led by President Paul M. Cousins faculty took cuts in salary in the periods of crisis. Academics were strengthened through membership with the National Association of Schools of Music.\n\nIn the 1950s, the college became co-educational and the addition of male students created a need for a new male-only residence hall. The university also began intercollegiate athletics program in the NAIA and initiated new clubs organizations and fraternities. Randall Minor became the college's 14th president in 1958. Under Minor, control of the selection process for trustees was given to the Georgia Baptist Convention. The college constructed a new administration building, student center, library, fine arts center and hired additional faculty for the expanding school. The late 1950s also saw the first African-American student graduate.\n\nThe political and social climate of the 1960s had a great effect on the college throughout the decade. During the era the student government's power increased and new organizations were created on campus. A number of special events were held on campus, including memorial services for both the John F. Kennedy assassination and Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Earth Day was observed for the first time. In 1973 Shorter College celebrated its 100th anniversary through special activities and traditions.\n\nInternational programs began in the 1990s and the university expanded MBA programs and adult education programs with the establishment of the School of Professional Programs in the Atlanta area. The university dedicated the Winthrop-King Centre and created the Fitton Student Union when it converted the old gym into the facility. Shorter College constructed the Bass Apartments, the J. Robert Eubanks Welcome Center and the Robert H. Ledbetter baseball field.\n\nIn 2005, the college attempted to break away from the Georgia Baptist Convention. The Georgia Supreme Court, however, ruled that Shorter's board didn't have the authority to sever ties with the convention. On June 1, 2010, Shorter College changed its name to Shorter University to reflect the institution's growth and expansion.\nIn December 2012 SACSCOC reaffirmed Shorter University's accreditation through 2022.\n\nIn October 2011, the university introduced a requirement that its employees sign a \"Statement of Faith\" and a \"Personal Lifestyle Statement\" in which they agree to adhere to the following principles:\n\n\nThe university is located on a 155-acre campus in Rome. There is a satellite campus in North Atlanta.\n\nShorter also offers online degrees for various associate's, bachelor's, master's programs.\n\nIn 2005, the college enrolled approximately 1,000 students in its traditional programs with an additional 1,500 individuals enrolled in its professional studies programs. Shorter offers bachelor's degrees in 30 fields of study as well as some master's degrees.\n\nShorter University claims to have had a graduate school acceptance rate of 80 percent and an 87 percent acceptance rate to medical colleges over the past fifteen years.\n\nShorter athletic teams are known as the Shorter Hawks. The university currently sponsors 21 varsity sports programs, including ten men's teams, nine women's teams and two co-ed cheerleading squads. In May 2011, Shorter announced it would apply for membership into the NCAA at the Division II level. It was accepted into the NCAA reclassification process in July 2011 and joined the Gulf South Conference. The University became a provisional member of NCAA Division II in the summer of 2013.\n\nIn its final year in the NAIA, Shorter University athletics finished ranked second in the final NAIA Learfield Sports Directors' Cup standings. Shorter's No. 2 final ranking was the highest in school history. The Hawks scored in 12 sports and claimed the softball and men's outdoor track and field championships – Shorter won an outdoor track title for the second straight year. Shorter also placed second in men's indoor track and field, third in men's basketball, fourth in women's indoor track and field and fifth in women's golf. Shorter's No. 2 final ranking is a culmination of a journey to the top of the NAIA that began to build momentum five years ago. The Hawks managed just 182.00 total points in 2006–07. Shorter ended the campaign ranked No. 87, and a 13th-place finish in softball is all that kept Shorter from finishing in the triple digits. That all changed a year later. Shorter shot up 66 spots to No. 21 with 509.25 points in the 2007–08 final standings behind a record spring that resulted in six programs accounting for 356.25 points. The Hawks dipped to No. 33 in 2008–09, but ascended to No. 11 in 2009–10, finishing for the first time ahead of perennial power and rival Lee University to end the year as the top rated member of the Southern States Athletic Conference. A fourth-place finish in women's outdoor track and field, fifth place in softball and sixth place in men's track and field paved the way for Shorter's highest Directors’ Cup finish to date that resulted in 587.25 points. Shorter climbed all the way to No. 3 last year thanks in large part to its indoor and outdoor double in men's track, setting the stage for a record setting 2011–12 year that helped Shorter depart the NAIA with a bang.\n\nThe Hawks placed third in 2010–11 on the shoulders of men's indoor and outdoor track and field national championships and 11th in 2009–10. In addition, track and field head coach, Scott Byrd, was named the NAIA Men's Indoor Track and Field National Coach of the Year after the indoor title, and won his second National Coach of the Year honor for the outdoor crown.\n\nMen's sports\n\nWomen's sports\nNotable alumni include the famous concert organist J. Buxte Max, Texas painter and art teacher Vivian Louise Aunspaugh, Tennessee businesswoman and politician Marilyn Lloyd, Georgia politician Nathan Dean, opera singer Jamie Barton, Bill Foster, head basketball coach in the NCAA and one of only 16 coaches to win 500 or more games in his career, and Phil Jones, a football coach who won the 2008 FCA Grant Teaff Coach of the Year honor and the 2008 AFCA Regional Coach of the Year. Anthony O'Garro is a professional soccer player currently playing for AC St. Louis in the USSF Division 2 Professional League.

{"id": "2318021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318021", "title": "Paddy Chew", "text": "Paddy Chew\n\nPaddy Chew (; 29 March 1960 – 21 August 1999) was the first Singaporean person with HIV/AIDS to come out to the general public.\n\nHe attended St. Stephen's School and St. Patrick's School before becoming a flight steward.\nHe worked for Singapore Airlines for thirteen years, after which he joined the Boom Boom Room, Singapore's first drag cabaret.\n\nChew was not aware of :AIDS or HIV during the first half of his career as a flight attendant, and never used a condom. He began practising safe sex after hearing of the disease in 1986 or '87, but fell ill in 1995, two years after leaving Singapore Airlines.\nHis hospital caretakers were inexperienced with his condition, failing to recognise his oral thrush until he made the diagnosis. He was put through a series of standard medical tests before being administered an HIV test at his request, to the reluctance of his doctors.\n\nAfter his diagnosis he was relieved to know what was wrong. He travelled to Brussels to begin receiving treatment unavailable in Singapore at the time, but by 1996 he had lost 45% of his weight and his health was failing rapidly.\n\nOut of an inability to function and a desire to prevent scandalising his workplace should his condition be discovered, he left the Boom Boom Room.\n\nOn 12 December 1998 during the First National AIDS Conference in Singapore, Chew became the first Singaporean AIDS patient to publicly declare his disease, but he was not the first AIDS patient in Singapore. The first was his colleague, a flight steward of mixed parentage. He declared himself bisexual but had yet to identify a woman who had slept with him.\n\nHe became a public figure overnight, giving many interviews and inviting attention everywhere he went.\nHis likeness and words on AIDS in Singapore were printed in local and foreign publications. His public position drew controversy. A columnist in the Chinese-language daily Lianhe Zaobao criticised him for being a promiscuous bisexual while others considered him a publicity-seeker.\n\nResponding to the allegations, Chew retorted, \"I do not mind being famous for winning the Miss Universe crown, or as a singer, or a beautiful face, you know? Who wants to be famous for having AIDS? For goodness sake!...I have seen too many AIDS patients die. Most die alone. There is no warmth, no care for them. They are not ready to die- you can see it in their eyes. I told myself I had to do something worthwhile for myself and for the cause- to clear the path for future patients, so that they will not die like that.\"\n\nIn 1998 he began working on a one-man autobiographical play called \"Completely With/Out Character\", his debut effort. The final version was produced by The Necessary Stage, written by Haresh Sharma, directed by Alvin Tan and staged at The Drama Centre from 10–17 May 1999. At the end of each performance, Chew would strip to his shorts and raise his arms to allow the audience to take in his emaciated frame. This was followed by a frank question and answer session. All proceeds from the play were donated to the charity organisation for which he was an outspoken volunteer, Action for AIDS (AfA). Reviewing the play in \"The Straits Times\", poet and playwright Alfian Sa'at called \"Completely With/Out Character\" \"the most extreme form of docu-theatre\", writing, \"The audience was given the privilege of witnessing a play, which, like its subject, was too aware of its ephemeral existence\".\n\nChew dreamed aloud of writing a book and taking a last holiday in Europe, but his last wishes were not to be. His health deteriorated rapidly, necessitating his admission to the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) in Moulmein Road in June 1999, 2 months before his death.\n\nAt the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival 2015, artist Zihan Loo presented \"With/Out\", a performance installation based on Chew's monologue \"Completely With/Out Character\". Loo told \"The Straits Times\": \"As a queer person, I have always been inspired by Paddy's strength and fortitude. I often wonder, if I was put in his position, whether I would have the courage to step out like he did.\" \"With/Out\" also featured the first public screening of taped performances from three evenings of \"Completely With/Out Character\".\n\nChew died at the CDC from complications of HIV infection at 6:15 a.m. on 21 August 1999, three months after his play's run ended.\n\nChew's sister, who declined to be named, and Alvin Tan, the Artistic Director of The Necessary Stage were by his bedside. Tan called the press to request for help in informing Chew's friends about his funeral service at 3:45 p.m. at the Mount Vernon Crematorium, Hall two. Chew's family requested that there be \"no wreaths, no sad tears, no black attire and for everybody to dress glam\".\n\nDance music played at Mount Vernon Crematorium's Hall Two and the mourners came dressed in red, blue, pink and orange. People with AIDS must be buried or cremated within 24 hours of death in Singapore, so his funeral was held that very afternoon, with about 80 people present.\n\nChew's sister Jessie, 37, said in her short eulogy, \"He wanted everyone to come, preferably in red, and party with him.\" She said that her brother remained full of spirit and fought all the way to the end.\n\nThere also were 2 older siblings present, Shirley, 53 and Edwin, 52. Another sister, Joanne, 41, was living abroad. 2 others, the managing director of Boom Boom Room, Alan Koh and an old friend, Audrey Fegen, gave additional eulogies.\n\nThe service, led by Roman Catholic priest Augustine, lasted less than half-an-hour. Calvin Tan, 38, a friend of Chew's since Primary 1, said: \"He was in critical condition at 8 p.m. on Friday, but he was a fighter. He fought from 8 p.m. to 6 this morning. He refused to give up.\"\n\nAction for Aids president, Assoc. Prof. Roy Chan, who knew Chew since he was diagnosed with AIDS in 1995 and who worked closely with him on several AIDS awareness projects, said: \"Paddy was a very outspoken person. He had a lot of guts to do what he did. He was selfless and courageous. He did not do it for himself, but for society.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2318034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318034", "title": "Taroona", "text": "Taroona\n\nTaroona (an Aboriginal word meaning sea-shell, specifically that of a 'Chiton') is a major residential suburb approximately 15 minutes drive from the centre of Hobart, Tasmania on the scenic route between Hobart and Kingston. Although on the edges of the City of Hobart, Taroona is actually part of the municipality of Kingborough.\n\nThe traditional owners of the lands now known as Taroona were the Aboriginal people of the Derwent estuary known as the Mouheneener people. Relatively little is known about the indigenous people's use of these lands, although some shell middens are said to have been found along the shorelines.\n\nThis district was originally known as Crayfish Point and the diaries of Robert Knopwood contain reference to expeditions to catch crayfish there.\n\nThe first European settlement at Taroona took place in the early 19th century, when land was granted to settlers who had relocated from Norfolk Island. For the remainder of that century, the area was largely used for farming, and was sparsely populated. \n\nIn the mid 1890s, Clarendon James Cox Lord purchased an 18-acre property which he called Taroona, after an Aboriginal word for sea shell. Lord built himself a pretty homestead and also established tea rooms where visitors could indulge in delicacies such as strawberries and cream while overlooking the River Derwent, Hobart.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, more large and elegant residences were built, as well as beach shacks and cottages which were used for seaside holidays by the residents of Hobart. Taroona Post Office opened on 2 August 1906.\n\nOn the foreshore above Taroona Beach there is the grave of a young sailor, Joseph Batchelor, who died on the Sailing Ship Venus in the Derwent Estuary in 1810, and was buried ashore on 28 January 1810. It is reputed to be the oldest European grave in Tasmania, and it is a declared Historical site.\n\nAfter WWII, significant subdivision of Taroona was undertaken, and the suburb's population rapidly expanded. Having been developed mainly in the \"era of the automobile\", Taroona was from the beginning a commuter suburb, and it has a notable absence of commercial or retail premises, many of the early retail enterprises having lost the battle with larger supermarkets elsewhere.\n\nIn 1958 a public High School was established on a large parcel of land on the Channel Highway central to the suburb, and with a frontage on to the foreshore of the Derwent River.\n\nIn 1960 the Taroona Primary School re-located to the same site, from an older building further south on the Channel Highway. Those original primary school buildings were adapted for kindergarten and pre-school but were burnt down by an arsonist in 1974. The kindergarten and pre-school were then re-built adjacent to the primary school.\n\nTaroona High School and Taroona Primary school are completely separate educational institutions, although they do share one oval. \n\nOriginally the high school catered for grades 7 to 11, but with the establishment of the separate Matriculation College system in 1962 the grade 11 students were transferred to the Hobart Matriculation College. At its maximum the enrolments at Taroona High School were about 1200 in the 1960s, with students traveling from Ferntree, South Hobart, Sandy Bay, Battery Point, Kingston, Blackmans Bay, and several centers further south.\n\nThere are now approximately 1150 students in high school, now only drawing students from the southern suburbs of Hobart. The current principal is Matthew Bennell.\n\nIn February 1967, southern Tasmania was engulfed in the most vicious wildfires on record, resulting in many deaths. Taroona was the closest suburb to the city of Hobart to take the full brunt of the fires, which swept across the suburb in the mid afternoon, wreaking havoc, and destroying many homes. Children and residents fled to the river, and many people's survival was due to the refuge the safe waters provided.\n\nTaroona was the childhood home of Tasmanian-born Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark, who attended the river-side Taroona High School before completing her high schooling at Mount Nelson's Hobart College and embarking on her tertiary degree at the University of Tasmania.\n\nLead vocalist of The Seekers, Judith Durham (born Judith Mavis Cock, 3 July 1943) lived in Taroona as a young girl, and attended the Fahan School in Sandy Bay before moving back to Melbourne in 1956. She joined The Seekers in 1963.\n\nDavid Bartlett, former Tasmanian premier (2008), was also raised in Taroona.\nGwen Harwood, poet and librettist, lived in Taroona with her family for a number of years in the nineteen fifties.\n\nSituated on the Channel Highway just south of Taroona is one of the State's most unusual historic buildings, the Shot Tower. The Shot Tower is a 48 m (157 ft) tall, 10 m (32 ft) in diameter circular sandstone tower constructed by Joseph Moir in 1870 from locally quarried sandstone blocks. Lead shot was made by dropping molten lead through a sieve at the top of the tower and by the time it hit the water at the bottom it was cold and spherical in shape. A climb up the 259 steps to the top of the tower gives a wonderful view of the Derwent Estuary.\n\nJust before reaching Taroona is the Truganini Reserve, named after the woman cited (with some contention) as the last surviving \"full-blooded\" Tasmanian aboriginal. A steep track leads from the reserve through forest up the side of Mount Nelson to the semaphore station at the summit that offers superb views over the Derwent River. The return walk takes around an hour and a half.\n\nCommunity website http://taroona.tas.au\n"}

As an actor, Dutt began his career in Bengali cinema in the Mrinal Sen film \"Chalachitro\", for which he won the best newcomer actor award at the Venice Film Festival. He acted in Aparna Sen's hit film, \"Mr. and Mrs. Iyer\". In 2018 he featured in Swapnasandhani's new play \"Taraye Taraye\", as Vincent Van Gogh, under the direction of Kaushik Sen.\n\nHe is also a national award-winning filmmaker and is one of the most prominent directors of Bengali cinema, directing \"Dutta Vs Dutta\",\"Madly Bangali\", \"The Bong Connection\", \"Chalo Let's Go\", and \"Ranjana Ami Ar Ashbona\". In recent years, he has directed the \"Byomkesh Bakshi\" movie series.\n\nAnjan Dutt was raised in the mountains of North Bengal. He had his schooling from St. Paul's School in Darjeeling.\n\nIn the late seventies, he joined a group called Open Theatre and in the early eighties performed plays translated from works of renowned foreign playwrights like Sartre, Peter Weiss, Jean Genet and Bertold Brecht. The group clearly drew inspiration from Nandikar, a highly active and already famous theatre group at that time. Due to politically sensitive content, they faced many obstructions in producing and performing their work, and eventually, the group discontinued its repertoire.\n\nDutt was first selected in the feature film \"Chalachitro\", directed by renowned filmmaker Mrinal Sen. The film and his performance were critically acclaimed at the Venice Film Festival, but for unknown reasons, it was never released commercially. Dutt said that he was more interested in doing art cinema rather than commercial mainstream cinema. After doing a few art films that were not so commercially successful, including the critically well-received \"Juganto\", scarcity of job opportunities forced him to take up jobs in advertising and later as a journalist for the Kolkata-based daily, \"The Statesman\".\n\nAt that time, Dutt was greatly influenced by the music of Kabir Suman who had heralded a new era in Bengali music through his songs. These songs and lyrics, commonly referred to as \"Jeebonmukhi\" (literally meaning \"towards life\"), were concerned with the tough reality of Bengali middle-class social life, in and around Kolkata.\n\nAnjan Dutt is married to Chanda Dutt. They have a son together- Neel Dutt, who is a famous music director of the Indian industry.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Common ownership of the means of production is a central goal of communist political movements as it is seen as a necessary democratic mechanism for the creation and continued function of a communist society. Advocates make a distinction between \"collective ownership\" and \"common property\" as the former refers to property owned jointly by agreement of a set of colleagues, such as producer cooperatives, whereas the latter refers to assets that are completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone.\n\nWhile virtually all societies have elements of common ownership, societies have existed where common ownership extended to essentially all possessions. Another term for this arrangement is a \"gift economy\" or communalism. Many nomadic societies effectively practiced common ownership of land. \n\nMarxist theory (specifically Friedrich Engels) holds that hunter-gatherer societies practiced a form of primitive communism as based on common ownership on a subsistence level.\n\nThe first church in Jerusalem shared all their money and possessions (Acts of the Apostles 2 and 4). Inspired by the Early Christians, many Christians have since tried to follow their example of community of goods and common ownership. Common ownership is practiced by some Christian groups such as the Hutterites (for about 500 years), the Bruderhof (for some 100 years) and others. In those cases, property is generally owned by a charity set up for the purpose of maintaining the members of the religious groups.\n\nCommon ownership is practised by large numbers of voluntary associations and non-profit organizations as well as implicitly by all public bodies. Most co-operatives have some element of common ownership, but some part of their capital may be individually owned.\n\nMany socialist movements advocate the common ownership of the means of production by all of society as an eventual goal to be achieved through the development of the productive forces, although many socialists classify socialism as public-ownership of the means of production, reserving common ownership for what Karl Marx termed \"upper-stage communism\". From a Marxist analysis, a society based on a superabundance of goods and common ownership of the means of production would be devoid of classes based on ownership of productive property.\n\nCommon ownership in a hypothetical communist society is distinguished from primitive forms of common property that have existed throughout history, such as Communalism and primitive communism, in that communist common ownership is the outcome of social and technological developments leading to the elimination of material scarcity in society.\n\nFrom 1918 until 1995 the \"common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange\" was cited in Clause IV of its constitution as a goal of the British Labour Party and was quoted on the back of its membership cards. The clause read:\n\nNeoclassical economic theory analyzes common ownership using contract theory. According to the incomplete contracting approach pioneered by Oliver Hart and his co-authors, ownership matters because the owner of an asset has residual control rights. This means that the owner can decide what to do with the asset in every contingency not covered by a contract. In particular, an owner has stronger incentives to make relationship-specific investments than a non-owner, so ownership can ameliorate the so-called hold-up problem. As a result, ownership is a scarce resource that should not be wasted. In particular, a central result of the property rights approach says that joint ownership is suboptimal. If we start in a situation with joint ownership (where each party has veto power over the use of the asset) and move to a situation in which there is a single owner, the investment incentives of the new owner are improved while the investment incentives of the other parties remain the same. However, in the basic incomplete contracting framework the sub-optimality of joint ownership holds only if the investments are in human capital while joint ownership can be optimal if the investments are in physical capital. Recently, several authors have shown that joint ownership can actually be optimal even if investments are in human capital. In particular, joint ownership can be optimal if the parties are asymmetrically informed, if there is a long-term relationship between the parties, or if the parties have know-how that they may disclose.\n\n"}

It is basically a musical stage adaptation of John Milton's epic poem \"Paradise Lost\", a tribute to Milton rather than a satire of the poem. That Dryden was an admirer of Milton's is surprising as the two men were politically opposed. Milton was against the restoration of the British monarchy, while the royalist Dryden was created England’s first Poet Laureate by the restored Charles II.\n\nSo great an admirer of Milton was Dryden that he said of the blind writer: \"This man cuts us all out.\" Milton actually gave permission for Paradise Lost to be transformed by Dryden, saying \"Ay, you may tag my verses if you will.\" The presumptuousness of Dryden's proposal never occurred to him.\n\nWritten in heroic couplets, \"The State of Innocence\" begins thus (in the voice of Lucifer):\n\nIt seems the musical score was never written to accompany the libretto. \"The State of Innocence\" has never been performed. At the time of its writing, the scenery required, and special effects like \"rebellious angels wheeling in the air, and seeming transfixed with thunderbolts\" over \"a lake of brimstone or rolling fire\", were too expensive for the King's Company, for which Dryden was working, and too technically demanding for their Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nThough the special effects required fall outside the reach of most independent projects, a silent film adaptation can be seen at http://vimeo.com/22760943.\n"}

{"id": "2318101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318101", "title": "The Grass Roots", "text": "The Grass Roots\n\nThe Grass Roots are an American rock band that charted frequently between 1966 and 1975. The band was originally the creation of Lou Adler and songwriting duo P. F. Sloan and Steve Barri. In their career, they achieved two gold albums, one gold single and charted singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 a total of 21 times. Among their charting singles, they achieved Top 10 three times, Top 20 three times and Top 40 fourteen times. They have sold over 20 million records worldwide.\n\nUntil his death in 2011, early member Rob Grill and a newer lineup of the Grass Roots continued to play many live performances each year. By 2012, the group featured no original band members, with a lineup personally chosen by Grill carrying on the legacy of the group with nationwide live performances.\n\nThe name \"Grass Roots\" (originally spelled as one word \"Grassroots\") originated in mid-1965 as the name of a band project by the Los Angeles songwriter and producer duo of P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri. Sloan and Barri had written several songs in an attempt by their record company, Dunhill Records (owned by Lou Adler), to cash in on the budding folk rock movement. One of these songs was \"Where Were You When I Needed You,\" which was recorded by Sloan and Barri. Sloan provided the lead vocals and played guitar, Larry Knechtel played keyboards, Joe Osborn played the bass and Bones Howe was on drums. The song was released under \"The Grass Roots\" name and sent, as a demo, to several radio stations of the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nWhen moderate interest in this new band arose, Sloan and Barri went to look for a group that could incorporate the Grass Roots name. They found one, The Bedouins, in a San Francisco band that won a Battle of the Bands at a Teenage Fair in San Mateo, California. A new version of \"Where Were You When I Needed You\" with that band's lead vocalist, Willie Fulton (later, an early member of Tower of Power) was recorded.\n\nIn late 1965, the Grass Roots got their first official airplay on Southern California radio stations, such as KGB (AM) in San Diego and KHJ in Los Angeles, with a version of the Bob Dylan song \"Mr. Jones (Ballad of a Thin Man)\". Dylan granted Sloan the opportunity to cover the song after Sloan showed appreciation for his first listen to Dylan's demo acetate of the song.\n\nFor some months, the group appeared as the first \"real\" Grass Roots. They were utilized by Dunhill to back up The Mamas & the Papas and Barry McGuire and became a house band at The Trip nightclub in Hollywood. The partnership with Sloan and Barri broke up when the band demanded more space for their own more blues rock-oriented material (which Dunhill was not willing to give them). Willie Fulton (lead vocals, guitar), Denny Ellis (guitar, backing vocals), and David Stensen (bass, backing vocals) went back to San Francisco, with drummer Joel Larson being the only one who remained in Los Angeles (he later returned to the group in 1971). Fulton, Ellis and Stensen continued to appear as the Grass Roots, with original Bedouins drummer Bill Shoppe, until Dunhill ordered them to cease since they decided to start all over again with another group they would groom to be the Grass Roots. In the meantime, the second version of \"Where Were You When I Needed You\" peaked in the Top 40 in mid-1966, while an album of the same name sold poorly.\n\nStill looking for a group to record their material and promote it with live dates, in 1966 Sloan and Barri offered Wisconsin-based band The Robbs (for whom they produced some early material) a chance to assume the identity of the Grass Roots, but the group declined.\n\nThe group's third – and by far most successful – incarnation was finally found in a Los Angeles band called The 13th Floor (not to be confused with the 13th Floor Elevators). This band consisted of Creed Bratton (vocals, guitar), Rick Coonce (drums, percussion), Warren Entner (vocals, guitar, keyboards), and Kenny Fukomoto (vocals, bass) and had formed only a year earlier. Entner, who had been attending film school at UCLA alongside future Doors members Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek, was drifting through Europe in the summer of 1965 singing and playing on street corners, when he met fellow busker and American Creed Bratton in Israel, where an Israeli businessman expressed interest in managing and promoting them. But the duo moved on individually and ended up back in LA by 1966, where they formed the 13th Floor and submitted a demo tape to Dunhill Records. After Fukomoto was drafted into the army, the group went through two replacements before finding singer/bassist Rob Grill. In 1967 the band was offered the choice to go with their own name or choose to adopt a name that had already been heard of nationwide.\n\nIn the beginning, they were one of many U.S. guitar pop/rock bands, but with the help of Barri and their other producers, they developed a unique sound for which they drew as heavily on British beat as on soul music, rhythm and blues and folk rock. Many of their recordings featured a brass section, which was a novelty in those days among American rock bands, with groups like Chicago just developing.\n\nThe bulk of the band's material continued to be written by Dunhill Records staff (not only Sloan and Barri) and the LA studio-musicians who were part of what became known as the Wrecking Crew played the music on most, if not all, of their hits. The Grass Roots also recorded songs written by the group's musicians, which appeared on their albums and the B-sides of many hit singles.\n\nAs the Grass Roots, they had their first Top 10 hit in the summer of 1967 with \"Let's Live for Today\", an English-language cover version of \"Piangi con me\", a 1966 hit for the Anglo-Italian quartet The Rokes. \"Let's Live for Today\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. With Rob Grill as lead singer, they recorded a third version of \"Where Were You When I Needed You.\" The band continued in a similar hit-making vein for the next five years (1967–1972).\n\nThe Grass Roots played at the Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival on Sunday, June 11, 1967, in the \"Summer of Love\" as \"Let's Live for Today\" was at #15 and climbing.\n\nIn late 1967, the band recorded the album \"Feelings\", which featured much heavier input in the songwriting and playing by the group members themselves. But its failure to sell prompted Barri to take full hold of the reins again as he began to move the band in a more R&B, horn punctuated, direction. By this time, Sloan had phased out of his involvement with the band and relocated to New York City to pursue a solo career.\nOn Sunday, October 27, 1968, the Grass Roots played at the San Francisco Pop Festival as their hit \"Midnight Confessions\" (their first record to feature horns, and with Carol Kaye playing the opening bass-line) was peaking at #5, and then played at the Los Angeles Pop Festival and Miami Pop Festival in December 1968.\n\nCreed Bratton became frustrated by Dunhill's refusal to allow the band to write its own songs and play the instruments on its records (although the members did play alone at concerts). After a disastrous appearance at the Fillmore West in April 1969, a \"slightly inebriated\" Bratton was asked to leave the band. He was replaced by Dennis Provisor on keyboards and vocals, and lead guitarist Terry Furlong (1970–1971) was brought in the following year to form a quintet. This was the first of many line-up changes for this version of the band.\n\nThe Grass Roots, with their new members, played at Newport Pop Festival 1969 at Devonshire Downs, which was a racetrack at the time but now is part of the North Campus for California State University, Northridge. The group played on Sunday June 22, 1969, a week before their hit \"I'd Wait A Million Years\" reached the Hot 100. In Canada they played at the Vancouver Pop Festival at the Paradise Valley Resort in British Columbia in August 1969.\n\nBy 1971 Furlong had stopped touring with the group to pursue a solo career but would continue to contribute on the records during the rest of their time on Dunhill. His touring replacement was Brian Naughton, who left in 1972. Drummer Rick Coonce was gone as well by the beginning of 1972 and new members Joe Pollard (drums, percussion) and another guitarist named Terry (last name unknown) joined up. Terry was soon replaced by Reed Kailing (vocals, guitars). However, drummer Pollard and keyboardist Dennis Provisor left soon after to go out as a duo (although Provisor was featured on the band's 1972 \"Move Along\" album) and were replaced by a returning Rick Coonce and keyboard man Virgil Weber (ex-Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds and Climax). Coonce was back for only a short period before he was gone again, turning the drum throne over to original member Joel Larson. Singers Rob Grill and Warren Entner remained the point of focus during these years.\n\nThe group's songs during 1967–1972 include: \"Let's Live for Today\", a cover of an Italian hit by The Rokes, \"Piangi con me\" (U.S. #8) and \"Things I Should Have Said\" (U.S. #23) (1967); \"Midnight Confessions\" (U.S. #5, their biggest hit) (1968); \"Bella Linda\" (a cover of an Italian hit by Lucio Battisti, \"Balla Linda\") (U.S. #28), \"Lovin' Things\" (a cover of a UK hit by Marmalade the previous year) (U.S. #49), \"The River Is Wide\" (U.S. #31), \"I'd Wait a Million Years\" (U.S. #15), and \"Heaven Knows\" (U.S. #24) (1969); \"Walking Through the Country\" (U.S. #44), and \"Baby Hold On\" (U.S. #35) (1970); \"Temptation Eyes\" (#15), \"Sooner or Later\" (U.S. #9), and \"Two Divided by Love\" (U.S. #16) (1971); \"Glory Bound\" (U.S. #34) and \"The Runway\" (U.S. #39) (1972).\n\nBy early 1974, the Grass Roots had left Dunhill (now ABC Records) and Kailing, Weber and longtime member Entner (later a successful manager with groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Quiet Riot) moved on, while former members Terry Furlong and Dennis Provisor returned to the fold. Furlong left permanently by mid-1974 to be succeeded by Gene Barkin, then by Reggie Knighton. The resulting group was Grill, Larson, Provisor and Knighton. Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter, who had penned the group's 1971 hit \"Two Divided By Love\" and many others, invited the band to join their Haven label, where they released an eponymous album in 1975, \"The Grass Roots\", containing the single \"Mamacita\", which charted at #71 on the Billboard Hot 100. Follow-up singles failed to chart.\n\nTheir 1976 single \"Out In The Open\" proved to be their swan song on Haven. Knighton left in 1976 and Alan Deane took over, followed by guitarist Glen Shulfer in 1977. ABC Records issued a final greatest hits package of the group titled \"ABC Collection\" in 1976. But in late 1977, Grill decided to take a break from performing and later recorded the \"14 Greats\" album on Gusto Records featuring himself and Provisor. This album consisted of 1978 rerecordings of their hits.\n\nThe group, still managed and booked by Grill (who owned the group's name),in late 1977 continued touring with Larson, Mark Miller (lead vocals, guitar) and Brian Carlyss (bass, backing vocals), joined by Lonnie Price (lead vocals, keyboards) and Randy Ruff (organ, backing vocals) for touring dates and TV appearances until November 1978. Larson was then joined by new players Scott Hoyt (lead vocals, guitars), David Nagy (lead vocals, bass) and Gene Wall (keyboards). Nagy and Larson left in 1979 and were replaced by a returning Carlyss and Reagan McKinley (drums, percussion).\n\nDuring this period, the group appeared on an HBO television special, \"60's Rock Scrapbook\", filmed at Magic Mountain amusement park in Valencia, California in October 1979, with Grill and Dennis Provisor making special appearances.\n\nGrill launched a solo career in 1979 (assisted on his solo album, \"Uprooted\", by Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie of Fleetwood Mac on the song \"Rock Sugar\"). Grill toured as a solo act in 1979–1980 opening for Fleetwood Mac's \"Tusk\" Tour with a band led by guitarist Rick Alexander.\n\nWhen interest in bands of the 1960s began to rise again in 1980, Grill (along with Provisor, Shulfer and new players Steve Berendt (bass) and Luke Meurett (drums) took back the Grass Roots name and toured the United States and Japan. Guitarist Miller returned to sub more dates with the group in 1981.\n\nIn 1982 Grill decided to go forward with a brand new lineup consisting of seasoned session players. They were Terry Oubre (guitars, backing vocals), Charles Judge (keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals) and Ralph Gilmore (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Another keyboardist, Bob Luna, came in around mid-1982 to sub for Judge on dates when he wasn't available. That same year, the new band released \"Powers of the Night\" on MCA. This would be the last album of new material to be released by the Grass Roots.\n\nLater in 1982, the Grass Roots performed an Independence Day concert on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., attracting a large crowd and setting a record for attendance (over half a million people), at that time, for an outdoor concert for a single musical act. However, in April 1983, James G. Watt, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of the Interior, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that \"rock bands\" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted \"the wrong element\", who would mug people and families attending any similar events in the future. During the ensuing uproar, Grill stated that he felt \"highly insulted\" by Watt's remarks, which he called \"nothing but un-American\".\n\nAfter \"Powers\" failed to attract much attention, Grill and the group continued to tour into 1984. Dave Rodgers (keyboards, backing vocals) replaced Charles Judge and after Terry Oubre and Ralph Gilmore departed, Grill brought in two additional new players named George Spellman (guitars, backing vocals) and Coy Fuller (drums, percussion) and headed over to tour Europe in the summer of '84. According to Grill, there was also a country single, \"St. Somewhere\", recorded in Nashville with this same lineup. This single was never released.\n\nBy late 1984, Grill had returned to the US and was touring with yet another new group of Grass Roots that included Dusty Hanvey (guitars, backing vocals), Larry Nelson (keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals) and David Page (drums, percussion). This lineup's first show was in Okinawa.\n\nFrom this point on, Grill and the group would concentrate on the \"60s nostalgia\" circuit, starting with the \"Happy Together 85\" Tour with fellow 1960s groups The Turtles, The Buckinghams and Gary Lewis & the Playboys.\n\nIn 1986 another package had them appearing with The Monkees, Gary Puckett, and Herman's Hermits. They were joined in this show by bassist Mark Clarke (ex-Uriah Heep and Rainbow) and a horn section, and backed up the Monkees and Gary Puckett during their sets as well.\n\nHanvey and Nelson continued backing the Monkees for their 1987 tour, while the Grass Roots joined \"Classic Superfest\", which also featured Herman's Hermits, Mark Lindsay, and Gene Clark's Byrds. For this tour, Mark Tamorsky handled guitar and Michael Lewis (soon replaced by Robbie Barker) was on keyboards. Terry Danauer was also added on bass at this point. But by October 1987, Hanvey and Nelson were back with Grill and Joe Dougherty replaced David Page on drums in 1989.\n\nIn 1991 Rhino Records released a double CD anthology of the group.\n\nMike Stec came in for Danauer on bass in 1992–1993 before Grill took over bass again.

Owned by iHeartMedia, the station serves the Chicago metropolitan area. The WLIT studios are located at the Illinois Center complex in the Chicago Loop, while the station transmitter is on top of the Willis Tower. Besides a standard analog transmission, WLIT broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio.\n\nThis station signed on the air as WEBH-FM on April 7, 1958; the call letters stood for the Edgewater Beach Hotel, the location of its original studios and transmitter site. The station was owned by the Buddy Black Broadcasting Co.\n\nWEBH-FM aired easy listening music, along with popular jazz on weekday evenings, a classical music block on Sundays afternoons, and Sunday morning religious programming. In 1968, the station's transmitter was moved to Riverside Plaza, and its studios were moved to the Congress Plaza Hotel. In 1969 the station was sold to Rich Communications Corp. for $325,000.\n\nIn January 1970, the station's call sign was changed to WWEL. WWEL broadcast a beautiful music format. The EL in WWEL's call sign was chosen to describe its Easy Listening format. In 1971, the station's transmitter was moved to the John Hancock Center, and it was sold to Sudbrink Broadcasting. The station's studios were moved to the John Hancock Center the following year.\n\nIn February 1972, the station's call sign was changed to WLAK. This time the call letters referred to Lake Michigan where Chicago is the largest port. WLAK adopted the beautiful music format produced and distributed by Stereo Radio Productions, as did the other Sudbrink FM stations. WLAK did well in the ratings throughout the 1970s, and was the top rated FM station in 1975.\n\nIn 1974, the station's transmitter and studios were moved to the Sears Tower. In 1978, WLAK was sold to Storer Broadcasting for $4.25 million. That December, Storer announced that it would exit radio to focus on its television stations and cable systems. While the company's other radio stations were sold in 1979, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations of the time required Storer to retain WLAK for three years. Storer sold WLAK to Viacom International for $8 million in 1981.\n\nIn March 1982, WLAK's format began to shift towards soft adult contemporary. More soft vocals were added to the playlist, while the share of instrumentals was reduced. Core artists included Neil Diamond, Barbra Streisand, Lionel Richie, and softer selections by the Beatles. On August 8, 1983, it completed its transition to soft AC. The instrumentals were cut entirely, and the station was branded as \"Love Songs.\" It featured love songs from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, from artists such as Dionne Warwick, Frank Sinatra, and Gordon Lightfoot. Later, its slogan was \"Songs to Sing Along With,\" as it continued to air a soft AC format.\n\nWLAK changed call letters on January 16, 1989, to WLIT-FM, and rebranded as \"Lite FM\", using the slogan \"Lite Favorites.\" Viacom sold its radio stations to Chancellor Broadcasting in 1997. In 1999 Chancellor restructured as AMFM Inc. In 2000, WLIT's ownership changed to Clear Channel Communications after Clear Channel's merger with AMFM.\nOver time, the station evolved to a mainstream adult contemporary format. WLIT became Chicago's only adult contemporary station on August 1, 2011, when former rival 105.9 WCFS-FM flipped to a simulcast of all-news radio 780 WBBM. This marked the first time in years Chicago only had one AC radio station.\n\nOn June 17, 2013, at 9 AM, WLIT rebranded as \"93.9 My FM.\" The first song on \"My FM\" was \"Teenage Dream\" by Katy Perry. The station's playlist was adjusted to be more current/recurrent-based. On December 1, 2017, during its annual Christmas music programming, WLIT returned to the Lite FM branding. The station also dropped its carriage of the syndicated \"On with Mario Lopez\" evening show, replacing it with the syndicated call-in and dedications show \"Delilah\".\n\nIn December 2018, Robert Feder reported that WLIT planned to flip to a soft adult contemporary format. It would begin using the slogan \"Relaxing Favorites\" after the conclusion of its Christmas programming.\n\nIn February 2006, WLIT began broadcasting in HD Radio. WLIT's HD-2 subchannel was originally a simulcast of the now-defunct \"Real Oldies\" AM 1690 WRLL (now WVON). It later changed to a mix of disco music and 1970s/1980s oldies called \"Flashback.\" In August 2009, the format changed again, this time to a gold-based AC format known as \"Chicago's Classic Lite,\" and later branded as \"Delilah.\" \n\nOn February 1, 2016, WLIT's HD-2 adopted a Regional Mexican format branded \"Poder 97.5\" (Power 97.5), which was rebroadcast at 97.5 MHz through FM translator W248BB. On May 6, 2019, WLIT-HD2 dropped the \"Poder 97.5\" Regional Mexican format and switched to iHeart's \"The Breeze\" soft adult contemporary format. The 97.5 translator flipped to Christian contemporary music, as an affiliate of K-Love.\n\nFrom early November through Christmas Day each year, WLIT changes its branding to \"The Holiday Lite\". The format switches to all Christmas music, resuming its regular branding and Soft AC sound on December 26. \n\nDuring the period between December 26 and January 2, the Christmas music moves to the HD2 channel while the main terrestrial station resumes the regular format. After the mid-2013 rebranding, the all-Christmas tradition was continued without reference to \"lite\".\n\nIn December 2000, the station began airing the nationally syndicated Delilah program on weekday evenings. It is produced by Premiere Networks, which is co-owned with WLIT. WLIT cancelled Delilah's program in November 2007, but it returned in October 2008. Delilah's program was taken off WLIT again in March 2012 but was brought back in December 2017, after the station returned to its \"Lite FM\" branding. Delilah is currently heard Sunday through Friday evenings.\n\nWLIT also carries the Ellen K Weekend Show from co-owned KOST Los Angeles on Saturday mornings. As with Delilah, Ellen K is syndicated by Premiere Networks.\n\nMelissa Forman joined WLIT as morning host in 2001, remaining until 2006, but returning 14 months later. Forman was again let go in 2009, and began co-hosting \"You & Me This Morning\" on WCIU-TV, but was again hired as morning host on WLIT in May 2018.\n\nWLIT's midday DJ is Robin Rock, Mick Lee is heard in afternoon drive time and Theresa Lucas overnight.\n\n"}

Later, Shueisha collected the chapters and published them in 18 \"tankōbon\" volumes. The \"Cobra\" manga spawned various sequel manga series, one-shots, a feature-length anime film, two anime seriesa 31-episode series in 1982, and a 13-episode series in 2010, two original video animations (OVAs), audio albums, video games, and other merchandise. In 2010, Alexandre Aja announced the interest in producing a live-action film.\n\nIn the United States, portions of the manga were published by Viz Media in 1990 and the complete series was published in Kindle format by Creek & River in 2015. The feature film was licensed by Tara for its release in American theaters and by Manga Entertainment in British theaters in 1995. Urban Vision and Discotek Media released it for home video market, while Madman Entertainment acquired it for the Australasian region's release. The anime series was licensed in the Northern American region by Nozomi Entertainment.\n\nIn Japan, the \"Cobra\" manga has sold 40 million copies, making it one of \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\"s best-selling manga series of all time. Publications for manga, anime and other media have compared the series to \"Star Wars\" and \"Barbarella\", and the main character's attitude to James Bond. Its film adaptation received mixed reviews, and the original anime series as well as \"Cobra the Animation\" has been well received by reviewers.\n\nIn the far future, an office worker named Johnson leads a dull and mundane life. One Sunday morning, his robotic servant Ben suggests that he go to the Trip Movie Corporationa company that enables its customers to experience a dream as though it were a reality. Johnson asks to be a king of a harem and to command a battlestar.\n\nIn his dream, however, Johnson instead becomes \"Cobra\", an adventurer who explores space with his android partner Lady Armaroid. Cobra wields the Psychogun, a cybernetic arm-laser gun, to fight monsters and the Pirate Guild, an organized crime syndicate of pirates. After a battle with the Guild, Cobra allows its leader Captain Vaiken to escape. Vaiken distributes Cobra's picture to other pirates, making him a wanted man. After the dream ends, Johnson describes the fantasy to an attendant, who is surprised because Johnson's dream should not have any reference to pirates or to Cobra.\n\nOn his way back home, Johnson crashes into a speeding car whose driver looks like Captain Vaiken. When Johnson mentions the resemblance, the driver reveals himself as Vaiken. He asks Johnson about \"Cobra\" and threatens to kill Johnson if he does not answer. Johnson unconsciously lifts his arm and a ray shoots out of his hand, killing Vaiken. The shot explodes Johnson's arm, revealing the Psychogun embedded in it.\n\nJohnson rushes home, where Ben notices the weapon on his arm. Johnson then realizes that he remembers nothing from before the last three years. After looking into a mirror, he finds a knob and turns it to reveal a secret room. There, he finds the revolver which he used in his dream. At that moment, armed intruders break into the house and address him as \"Cobra\". A battle ensues, and Ben's robot shell breaks to reveal Lady Armaroid, with whom Johnson kills the intruders.\n\nJohnson starts to remember his previous existence as Cobra. Hunted by the Pirate Guild for meddling in their criminal enterprises and tired of life on the run, Cobra surgically altered his face and had his memories erased. Lady Armaroid tells Cobra that the Trip Movie has triggered his subconscious to regain access to the memories of his former life. Cobra and Lady Armadroid resume their adventurous life together.\n\n\n\"Cobra\" is Buichi Terasawa's debut manga series. Previously he had written and illustrated between twenty and thirty science-fiction \"shōjo\" (targeted towards girls) short stories for manga contests held by manga magazines, with one of them earning an honorable mention. Terasawa created \"Cobra\" by combining the spaghetti western subgenre and Japanese stories featuring a \"wandering swordsman\". Terasawa wanted to create a hero who would be able to carry a concealed weapon and then the Psychogun was created before the titular character. His concept of a hero has been greatly influenced by \"spaghetti westerns with a James Bond-type spin to them.\" Also from Bond series came the concept of several women who circulate around Cobra. For Cobra, he also drew inspiration from the French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo and his \"phlegmatic style\", specifically from his characters on \"Breathless\" (1960) and \"That Man from Rio\" (1964). The then rising actresses Dominique Sanda and Catherine Deneuve also inspired the names of the Royal Sisters.\n\nIn general, Terasawa has been influenced by films, including \"Star Trek\", \"Star Wars\", René Laloux's animations, the \"James Bond\" film series, Akira Kurosawa's films, and Disney films prior to \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989). For example, Jane Fonda's performance in the cult science-fiction film \"Barbarella\" (1968) served as a direct model for his character Jane, whose hairstyle was also inspired by Princess Aurora's in the Disney animated film \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1959). For his storytelling, panel layout, and narrative pacing in general, he draws influence from manga artist Osamu Tezuka, who mentored him. Terasawa declared, \"Without him, ... \"Cobra\" would never have existed.\n\nWritten and illustrated by Buichi Terasawa, \"Cobra\" was first published in 1977 in Shueisha's Japanese \"shōnen\" manga magazine \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" as a one-shot edition.

Ivevei Upatkoon of \"EX\" online magazine praised it as a \"rich fantasy\" that was unmatched by any other. She said the main character took \"after James Bond, albeit somewhat on the silly side, and the costumes and bizarre worlds are but a shade shy of plagiarizing \"Barbarella\"\". She was impressed that the series \"is surprisingly devoid of the sexual innuendo and exploitation that anime fans have come to associate with decorative female characters\"; it avoids the stereotypical, beautiful women, and instead creates its own \"extreme\" world. Upatkoon also said that modern readers might find the manga dated and would be discouraged from reading it, despite the improvement in artistic quality as the series progresses. Writing for Anime News Network (ANN), Jason Thompson described \"Cobra\" as \"a significant piece of manga history\". Thompson wrote that the women of the series have a \"realistic physique and not some \"moe\" jailbait or grotesque \"bakunyu\" explosion\". Thompson deemed \"Cobra\" as a parody of both Western action heroes and \"Star Wars\" and 1970s \"shōjo\" science fiction and its concept of beauty\".\n\nPedro Cortes from Japanator affirmed, \"\"Space Adventure Cobra\" is interesting in that it takes a shard of an idea from a classic and then spins it out into its own epic.\" Cortes praised its \"charming\" designs, while criticized the main character lack of development as \"the only negative thing.\" He added, \"There isn't a ton of depth, but the show doesn't pretend to be anything but a fun, sci-fi romp around the galaxy.\" ANN's Theron Martin praised its \"surprisingly solid\" art \"for a series of its era\" and affirmed, \"it does stand up well as high-spirited, fun-loving action fare with occasional darker overtones.\" Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post said, \"It's simple but full of adventure, interesting characters and locations and a sense of fun that definitely makes it work in a very good way\" and has \"a solid visual design.\" Washington, in a review for \"Otaku USA\", commended it for being \"entertaining overall\" and having \"an overall fun vibe\" because of its \"smooth\" art; he, however, criticized what he called \"serious misogynistic tendencies.\"\n\nChris Beveridge from Mania.com praised the \"Cobra the Animation\" anime series and its visual design, comparing to \"The Psychogun\" ones, but said it is not for those who are unaware the original series. He said the anime has \"a healthy dose of action, the kind of sexuality that's a trademark of the series ... as well as a good bit of silly fun\". In the second episode review, Beveridge said it \"seems to be following much the same kind of pace and structure\" as the OVAs. Its animation was compared with the \"Darkside Blues\"; ANN's Erin Finnegan said it was a \"gritty\" animation, but that from episode five, the animation quality looks more modern and much less gritty. Beveridge said the anime's idea is simple, but added it is \"also not a show you see often since it doesn't center around teenagers, schools or the harem concept\". He said it is not \"a great show\", but that \"it gives us something different than the usual\"the reason it is \"enjoyable\".\n\n\"Cobra\" made Terasawa, who at the time was 22 and was little known, famous. Approximately 40 million copies of \"Cobra\" have been sold, making it one of \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\"'s best-selling manga series of all time. The anime television series was a major success in France in the 1980s. \"Le Monde\"s Frédéric Potet said it \"marked a whole generation of young viewers\", and Joel Metreau of \"20 minutes\" asserted it gained a cult following. Alexandre Aja and Luc Besson are among the French filmmakers that are fans of the series.\n\nIts humorous style and sexual innuendos influenced \"City Hunter\", and Shinichirō Watanabe's works \"Cowboy Bebop\" and \"Space Dandy\" owe their nostalgic appearance and the ironic tone, respectively, to \"Cobra\". Cobra's \"provoking look\", ironic style and capacity of changing from a little smile to a serious face also inspired video game designer Hideki Kamiya to create the character of Dante from the \"Devil May Cry\" series.\n\nThirty years later, \"Cobra the Animation\" has been well received by fans; the OVA was among the best-selling for two weeks, and the sixth volume of the anime series was one of the best-selling DVDs for one week.\n\nIn 2008, Buichi Terasawa said he received a Hollywood offer to purchase the rights to a live-action film adaptation of the series. He stated it was \"off-the-record\", and that if it happened it would be partly standalone and separate from his original manga. However, in 2010, Alexandre Aja announced he had purchased its rights, and that he planned to direct a live-action film adaptation of \"Cobra\". Aja was inspired to create this film adaptation because the original manga was one of his childhood favorites. Aja said he wanted to create a \"tent pole-sized live action franchise\".\n\nIn 2011, Aja wrote a script with Gregory Levasseur, and production was held by Aton Soumache and Dimitri Rassom under Onyx Films and Studio 37 with a budget of more than $100 million. Later, a teaser poster depicting promotional concept art for \"Cobra: The Space Pirate\", along with a release date scheduled for mid-2013, was unveiled. In September 2013, however, Aja admitted that making the film will be \"very hard\" since \"to do a new kind of \"Star Wars\", [is] expensive\" though he stated \"we are trying everything, we will make it.\" In July 2014, Aja revealed it was estimated that the project would require a budget of over $150 million and that he was seeking to have an A-list actor to help attract a funder. One of his main difficulties, Aja said in 2015, was to decide who would star the film: \"When I think 'who the heck is going to play that Cobra?', I become unable to move forward.\"\n\nIn a June 2016 interview, Aja said he did not abandon it and that \"The project is well advanced\". Working with the Orange Studio and a group of twenty concept artists, Aja was able \"to develop an absolutely huge universe in visual research\". One of the drawbacks that made him slow the process was the release of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" in 2014, because Aja had to change several aspects of \"Cobra\" to differentiate it. In June 2017, he revealed the script was ready, but commented that another drawback is the big budget required for the film, which finds no funders in the US because the franchise is relatively unknown there. In April 2018, Aja revealed the film was in preproduction at Lionsgate until a regime change occurred; the company's new staff considered the film budget (US$130 million) to be high and the release of \"\" was also a factor on the cancellation.\n\n"}

He appeared as Queen Vic landlord Eddie Royle in BBC One soap opera EastEnders between 1990 and 1991.\n\nMelia was born in Berkshire and attended St Mary's College, Strawberry Hill, the oldest Roman Catholic college in England. Before taking up acting he was a teacher. At one stage he ran a bar in Spain and thought about applying for a pub tenancy in England. However the idea was vetoed by his wife, former actress turned teacher, Celia Melia.\n\nHe began acting in television in the early 1970s, usually playing heavies or policemen, though he spent four years performing classic plays with the National Theatre. In 1990, he joined the BBC One soap opera \"EastEnders\" as pub landlord Eddie Royle; however, he only lasted just over a year in this role as his character was killed off in September 1991. His character was stabbed by Nick Cotton (John Altman) who was later tried for the murder but cleared.\n\nAfter leaving \"EastEnders\", he appeared as Frank Dagley on \"Dangerfield\"; and, more recently, Jerry Block for over a hundred episodes of the footballing soap opera \"Dream Team\".\n\nHis rugged features have led to parts in numerous crime dramas: \"The Sweeney\", \"Fox\", \"The Bill\", \"Minder\" in the Series 1 episode \"Monday Night Fever\", \"C.A.T.S. Eyes\", \"Campion\", \"The Chinese Detective\", \"Dempsey and Makepeace\", \"Rumpole of the Bailey\", \"Inspector Morse\", \"Maigret\", \"The Detectives\", \"Daylight Robbery\" and \"New Tricks\".\n\nHe has also had parts in many other established dramas including \"When the Boat Comes In\", \"Coronation Street\", \"Casualty\" and most recently \"Doctors\" and \"Emmerdale\".

One of the most widespread sundew species, it has a circumboreal distribution, being found in all of northern Europe, much of Siberia, large parts of northern North America, Korea and Japan but is also found as far south as California, Mississippi and Alabama in the United States of America and on New Guinea.\n\nThe leaves of the common sundew are arranged in a basal rosette. The narrow, hairy, long petioles support long laminae. The upper surface of the lamina is densely covered with red glandular hairs that secrete a sticky mucilage.\n\nA typical plant has a diameter of around , with a tall inflorescence. The flowers grow on one side of a single slender, hairless stalk that emanates from the centre of the leaf rosette. White or pink in colour, the five-petalled flowers produce , light brown, slender, tapered seeds.\n\nIn the winter, \"D. rotundifolia\" produces a hibernaculum to survive the cold conditions. This consists of a bud of tightly curled leaves at ground level.\n\nThe plant feeds on insects, which are attracted to the glistening drops of mucilage, loaded with a sugary substance, covering its leaves. It has evolved this carnivorous behaviour in response to its habitat, which is usually poor in nutrients or is so acidic that nutrient availability is severely decreased. The plant uses enzymes to dissolve the insects – which become stuck to the glandular tentacles – and extract ammonia (from proteins) and other nutrients from their bodies. The ammonia replaces the nitrogen that other plants absorb from the soil, and plants that are placed in a high-nitrogen environment rely less upon nitrogen from captured insects.\n\nIt has been assumed that insects were also attracted to the bright red color of the common sundew, but studies using artificial traps have suggested that color does not affect prey attraction.\n\nIn North America, the common sundew is found in all parts of Canada except the Canadian Prairies and the tundra regions, southern Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and along the Appalachian Mountains south to Georgia and Louisiana.\n\nIt is found in much of Europe, including the British Isles, most of France, the Benelux nations, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Poland, Belarus, the Baltic countries, Sweden and Finland, as well as northern portions of Portugal, Spain, Romania, mountain regions of Bulgaria and in Iceland and southern regions of Norway and Greenland. It is infrequent in Austria and Hungary, and some populations are scattered around the Balkans.\n\nIn Britain, this is the most common form of sundew and it can be found on Exmoor, Dartmoor, Sedgemoor, the Lake District, Shropshire, Pennines and in Scotland, among other places. It is usually found in bogs, marshes and in hollows or corries on the sides of mountains. It is the county flower of Shropshire.\n\nIn Asia, it is found across Siberia and Japan, as well as parts of Turkey, the Caucasus region, the Kamchatka Peninsula and southern parts of Korea. Populations can also be found on the island of New Guinea and Italy.\n\nThe common sundew thrives in wetlands such as marshes and fens. It is also found in wet stands of black spruce, \"Sphagnum\" bogs, silty and boggy shorelines and wet sands. It prefers open, sunny or partly sunny habitats.\n\nThe round-leaved sundew is classified as Least Concern in the IUCN red list. \nIn North America, it is considered endangered in the US states of Illinois and Iowa, exploitably vulnerable in New York, and threatened in Tennessee. \n\n\"D. rotundifolia\" is one of the temperate species of \"Drosera\" cultivated by growers interested in carnivorous plants. To be grown successfully, plants of the wild species must be given a substantial period of winter dormancy during which they form hibernacula. The cultivar \"D. rotundifolia\" 'Charles Darwin' can be grown more successfully without a period of dormancy.\n\nAccording to D.H. Paper, \"et al.\", \"Drosera rotundifolia\" plant extracts show great efficacy as an anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic, more so than \"D. madagascariensis\", as a result of the flavonoids such as hyperoside, quercetin and isoquercetin, but not the naphthoquinones present in the extracts. The flavonoids are thought to affect the M muscarinic receptors in smooth muscle, causing the antispasmodic effects. Ellagic acid in \"D. rotundifolia\" extracts has also been shown to have antiangiogenic effects.\n\n"}

It comprises the Australian Federal Police, Australian Border Force, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre and the Australian Institute of Criminology . Each state and territory runs its own police service.\n\nThe national justice system is overseen by the Attorney-General's Department (Australia), with each state and territory having its own equivalent.\n\nPrison services are run independently by correctional services department in each state and territory.\n\nCrime statistics are collected on a state basis and then collated and further analysed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Between 2008–09 and 2017–18 the national victimisation rate decreased for personal crime in all categories except sexual assault (which remained steady), and also all household crimes selected in the national statistics. Approximately 5.0% (966,600) of Australians aged 15 years and over experienced personal crime.\n\nLaw enforcement in Australia is served by law enforcement officers under the control of federal government, states and territories and local agencies. A number of state, territory and federal agencies also administer a wide variety of legislation related to white-collar crime. Police are responsible for the administration of criminal law. Sheriffs and bailiffs in each state and territory are responsible for the enforcement of the judgments of the courts exercising civil law (common law) jurisdictions. The various state police forces are responsible for enforcing state law within their own states, while the Australian Federal Police (AFP) are responsible for the enforcement of and investigation of crimes against Commonwealth law which applies across the whole country.\n\nIn addition to the standard prisons run by the states (and not included in prisoner statistics), the Department of Home Affairs also operates a separate system of Australian immigration detention facilities to detain non-citizens who have breached the terms of or lack a visa. Some of these immigration detention centres are used to indefinitely detain asylum seekers and refugees, often without trial and in many cases for several years.\n\nDuring the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, large numbers of convicts were transported to the various by the UK Government. One of the primary reasons for the British settlement of Australia was the establishment of a penal colony to alleviate pressure on their overburdened correctional facilities. Over a period of eighty years, more than 165,000 British convicts were transported to Australia.\nDiscipline was poor among the early convicts, with high rates of theft, physical and sexual assault. Law enforcement was initially the preserve of the New South Wales Marine Corps, which accompanied the First Fleet. Australia's first civilian crime prevention force was established in August 1789, comprising a twelve-man nightwatch authorised to patrol the settlement at Sydney Cove and with powers \"for the apprehending and securing for examination\" anyone suspected of \"felony, trespass or misdemeanour.\"\n\nFrom the earliest days of settlement at Sydney Cove, settlers clashed with the indigenous peoples. Governor Arthur Phillip himself gave ex-convicts muskets which were utilised to shoot at Aboriginal people in the area, and also deployed soldiers to their allotted areas, who \"dispersed\" about 50 Aboriginal people. Hidden or sanctioned massacres continued through to the 20th century, the last recorded being in 1928 at Coniston massacre in Western Australia.\n\nBushrangers were originally escaped convicts in the early years of the British settlement of Australia who used the Australian bush as a refuge to hide from the authorities. By the 1820s, the term \"bushranger\" had evolved to refer to those who took up \"robbery under arms\" as a way of life, using the bush as their base. Bushranging thrived during the gold rush years of the 1850s and 1860s when the likes of Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner and John Gilbert led notorious gangs in the country districts of New South Wales.\n\nCivil disturbances and prison riots, have occurred throughout the history of European settlement in Australia, a selection of which follows:\n\nThe Australian Institute of Criminology hosts an interactive gateway to statistics and information on Australian crime and justice issues, called Crime Statistics Australia. This provides the easiest public access to statistics showing all aspects of crime in Australia, including death in custody, offender and victim statistics, types of crime, drug use, prisons and criminal courts. \n\nThe number of offenders proceeded against by police during 2016–2017 increased by 1% from the previous year to approximately 414,000.\n\nIn 2016–2017, the offender rate, which is the number of offenders in the population of Australia, increased slightly from 1.98% to 2%. The youth offender rate decreased for the seventh consecutive year in 2016–17; between 2009–10 and 2016–17, the rate fell from 3,339 to 2,330 offenders per 100,000 persons aged 10 to 17.\n\nThe most common type of offence in 2016-17 was illicit drug offences (20%), with sexual assault and related offences increasing by 3%, being the sixth successive annual increase and a total increase of 40%.\n\nData from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) shows that during the 2009/10 year police took action against 375,259 people, up by 4.8 percent from 2008/09 figures. Young offenders aged 10 to 19 comprised about 29 percent of the total offender population across Australia.\nIn the 2009/10 financial year, 84,100 women had police action taken against them across Australia, up by six percent compared with the previous year. 290,400 men had police action taken against them in 2009/10, an annual increase of 4 percent. About 30 percent of the women were accused of theft, whereas the most common principal offence for men was intention to cause injury and matters related to public order.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2017, the number of homicide victims across Australia decreased from 453 victims to 414 victims (down 39 victims or 9%). The murder victimisation rate was 0.8%. \n\nBetween the 1989-1990 and 2013-2014 statistical years, the national homicide rate decreased from 1.8 per 100,000 people to 1 per 100,000. There were 238 homicide incidents in Australia in 2013-14 compared with 307 in 1989–90. From the National Australian Homicide Monitoring program report 2012: \"The homicide rate has continued to decrease each year, since 1989-90. The periods 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 are the lowest homicide rate since data collection began in 1989\".\n\nPrisoner statistics 2000-present can be found on the Australian Bureau of Statistics page for \"4517.0 - Prisoners in Australia\".\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018 the national imprisonment rate increased by 3% from 216 to 221 prisoners per 100,000 adult population.\n\nIn 2018, adult prisoner numbers were up by 4% on the previous year, with female prisoner numbers increasing at a faster rate than male prisoners and with drug offences responsible for the highest rise by category. There were rises in all states except for South Australia. The breakdown was: acts intended to cause injury (9,659 prisoners or 22%); illicit drug offences (6,779 prisoners or 16%); and sexual assault and related offences (5,283 prisoners or 12%). Males accounted for 92% of all prisoners. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prisoners accounted for over a quarter of the total Australian prisoner population.\n\nResearch from the Australian Institute of Criminology showed that from 1990 until the middle of 2011, 40 percent of people who were fatally shot by police were suffering from a mental illness. In NSW, the fatalities included Adam Salter (shot dead in Sydney in 2009); Elijah Holcombe (shot dead in Armidale in 2009); and Roni Levi (shot dead on Bondi Beach in 1997). In Victoria, the fatalities included the 2008 shooting death of Tyler Cassidy. At age 15, Cassidy is believed to be the youngest person ever shot dead by police in Australia.\n\nIndigenous Australians are both convicted of crimes and imprisoned at a disproportionately high rate in Australia. The issue is a complex one, to which federal and state governments as well as Indigenous groups have responded with various analyses and numerous programs and measures. Many sources report over-representation of Indigenous offenders at all stages of the criminal justice system.\n\nThe gun buy-back program which was implemented in 1996, purchased and destroyed mostly semi-automatic and pump action firearms. Relatively frequent mass murders committed in the United States serve to re-ignite the debate on gun control laws from time to time, and Australia's gun control laws have been held up as an example of a workable solution for the safer management of guns and gun licensing by citizens of the United States and some members of Congress.\n\nCrime statistics before and after the implementation of gun laws have shown a decrease of the use of guns in crime. According to the national homicide monitoring program, the number of homicide incidents involving a firearm decreased by 57% between 1989-90 and 2013–14, from 75 to 32. Firearms were used in 13% of homicide incidents in 2013–14, compared with 24% in 1989–90.\n\n\n"}

Also featured are Harvard Medical School in Roxbury, Massachusetts and Harvard University in nearby Cambridge. The film's story earned Leonard Spigelgass a nomination as Best Story for the 23rd Academy Awards.\n\nBlonde B-girl Vivian (played by Jan Sterling) is pregnant and tries to contact the father to seek financial help. He refuses to meet and stops taking her calls. She goes to \"The Grass Skirt\" bar in Boston where she works and picks up a drunk (Marshall Thompson) so she can use his car to drive to Cape Cod, where she can confront the father face to face.\n\nVivian drives with the car's owner drunk by her side. When the man realizes he's in Cape Cod miles from Boston, he demands to be taken back. Instead, she ditches him and steals the car. But the father of the child kills Vivian rather than pay up or risk exposure of the affair to his wife and family. He buries Vivian's body in the dunes and sinks the car in a pond.\n\nA day later, the man reports his car stolen to his insurance but neglects to mention the blonde, not wanting to get in trouble with his wife (Sally Forrest), who had been hospitalized suffering from the loss of a pregnancy. Months later, the B-girl's skeleton is found half-buried on the beach. State Police Lt. Peter Moralas (Montalban), an overzealous and heartless police officer new to homicide division assigned to the District Attorney's Office in Barnstable, teams up with Boston police and uses forensics with the help of Dr. McAdoo, a Harvard doctor (Bennett), to figure out who the woman is.\n\nMoralas wants to know how she died. Mrs. Smerrling (Lanchester), a vile woman who is the owner of the boarding house where Vivian lived, visits James Harkley, the man Vivian had been calling from her boarding house, going so far as to steal the wealthy married man's gun during her visit. Moralas tracks down the stolen car from police records and questions Henry Shanway, the man Vivian was with the night she disappeared. Moralas eventually finds Shanway's car in the pond and he's identified in a police lineup. The innocent man is arrested and charged with the murder.\n\nDr. McAdoo discovers a bullet stuck in the car. Smerrling shows Harkley's gun to Jackie Elcott (Betsy Blair), a tenant in her building, who is familiar with firearms. Elcott removes the magazine, keeps the magazine, ensures the gun is unloaded and gives the gun back to Smerrling. Morales learns Smerrling has the gun. However, before he can question her, she attempts to blackmail Harkley for $20,000. She is knocked over the head and dies. Moralas chases but loses the killer. He comes across a hidden baggage check in the landlady's birdcage, which sends Moralas racing to catch the killer before the murder weapon can be disposed of. At the train station, he apprehends Harkley and takes him into custody. Morales phones Shanway's wife to tell her that her husband will soon be released. Mrs. Shanway answers Moralas with silence.\n\n\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $429,000 domestically and $346,000 foreign, resulting in a loss of $284,000.\n\n\"Time\" magazine called it a \"low-budget melodrama without box-office stars or advance ballyhoo [that] does not pretend to do much more than tell a straightaway, logical story of scientific crime detection\" but notes that \"within such modest limits, Director John Sturges and Scripters Sydney Boehm and Richard Brooks have treated the picture with such taste and craftsmanship that it is just about perfect.\" \"The New York Times\" called it \"an adventure which, despite a low budget, is not low in taste or its attention to technical detail, backgrounds and plausibility\" with a performance by Montalban that is \"natural and unassuming.\"\n\nNominated\n\n"}

It is similar to Java Web Start for the Java Platform or Zero Install for Linux.\n\nThe core principle of ClickOnce is to ease the deployment of Windows applications. In addition, ClickOnce aims to solve three other problems with conventional deployment models: the difficulty in updating a deployed application, the impact of an application on the user's computer, and the need for administrator permissions to install applications.\n\nClickOnce-deployed applications are considered \"low impact\", in that they are installed per user, not per machine. Administrator privileges are not required to install these applications. Each ClickOnce application is isolated from the others. This means one ClickOnce application is not able to \"break\" another. ClickOnce employs Code Access Security (CAS) to prevent system functions being called by a ClickOnce application from the web, ensuring the security of data and the client system in general.\n\nThe ClickOnce model supports both installed applications (akin to conventional Windows applications with Start Menu integration) and online applications (browser-hosted applications that are not installed, only run and cached). ClickOnce applications can be deployed to a computer from an internet location, a network share, or a local file location such as a CD-ROM.\n\nThe ClickOnce deployment technology has been integrated into Visual Studio 2005 and later. It is also natively supported by MSBuild, Microsoft's build management technology.\n\nA ClickOnce deployment is controlled through the use of two XML manifest files: a deployment manifest and an application manifest. The manifests are in the same XML format as the side-by-side assembly implementation. The deployment manifest (*.application file) describes the deployment model: the current version, update behavior, publisher identity along with a digital signature; this manifest is intended to be authored by administrators who handle deployment. The application manifest (*.exe.manifest file) describes the application assemblies, dependent libraries, and permissions required by the application. This file is intended to be authored by the application developer.

This episode focuses on Jadzia Dax, a Trill alien that has been implanted with Dax. The episode explores the nature of Dax and of Trill society.\n\nThis episode was co-written by D.C. Fontana, who had also written for the original series.\n\nAfter having a meal with Dr. Bashir, Lt. Dax is abducted by a group of aliens while walking back to her quarters. Dr. Bashir comes across the group and alerts Commander Sisko that she has been taken. The aliens nearly escape with her on their ship, having sabotaged Deep Space Nine's tractor beam, but the Deep Space Nine crew is able to reestablish the tractor beam and prevent the ship from leaving.\n\nBack on the station, one of the abductors, Ilon Tandro, accuses Dax—the Dax \"symbiont\", then in the body of Curzon Dax—of murdering his father, Ardelon Tandro, a famous military hero from Klaestron IV; he wants to punish Jadzia Dax for the crime. His claim is based on the fact that during a civil war a coded message informed the opposing side of his father's location, and of the people who knew the location, Curzon was the only one without an alibi.\n\nMajor Kira insists that Dax cannot be extradited to Klaestron without an arbitration hearing under Bajoran law. At the hearing, Sisko argues that Jadzia and Curzon Dax are two different individuals, sparking a lengthy debate. The arbiter suggests removing the Dax symbiont and leaving Jadzia behind, but Dr. Bashir says that neither would survive the operation.\n\nWhile Sisko and Ilon debate the merits of Ilon's claim that Trills are responsible for crimes committed by past hosts, Odo visits Ilon's mother, Enina. She tells him that Ilon has become obsessed with finding the one who betrayed his father. Tandro's murder inspired his people to victory and he has since become a worldwide hero. However, Enina is adamant that Curzon did not betray her husband.\n\nBack on the station, Dax's fate is uncertain. Ilon argues that failure to punish Trill symbionts for acts committed in past lifetimes would create a perfect crime. Curiously, Jadzia seems complacent about the entire affair. \n\nOdo discovers evidence of an affair between Curzon and Enina, giving him a motive for the murder. Enina admits the affair to Odo and reveals that her husband was not the hero in life that he was in death. As the hearing resumes, Enina states that at the time of the murder, Curzon was in her bed. The arbiter dismisses the case. \n\nAfter the hearing is over, Enina talks privately with Dax of how no one must ever know that her husband had sent the coded message himself in an attempt to betray his own people, and the rebels killed him for the favor.\n\nIn 2018, SyFy included this episode on their Jadzia Dax binge-watching guide for this character. They note this episode helps build the relationship between Jadzia and Sisko, as well as explore the nature of Dax.\n\n"}

It closed in March 2013.\n\nThe former prison site, on Howard Street, adjacent to Shrewsbury railway station, is near the site of the Dana Gaol, a medieval prison. The name The Dana is still often used for the prison, as well as being the name of the road to one side of the prison and the pedestrian route that runs from near the front of the prison into the town centre via a footbridge over the station. The now disused platform 8 at the station, masked from the opposite platform by a high wall, was used for transporting prisoners between 1868 and the First World War.\n\nA bust of prison reformer John Howard is above the main entrance to the prison. The street leading up to the prison from the main road is also named after him.\n\nCurrently the Dana Prison, Shrewsbury is open as a tourist attraction. Jailhouse Tours runs guided tours, theme events and experiences, educational days, history days, seasonal events, horror tours and School tours. Jailhouse Tours will continue to manage the site until development work begins on the building in 2019.\n\nThere has been a prison on the site since 1793, the original building being constructed by Thomas Telford to plans by Shrewsbury architect John Hiram Haycock; the present prison building was constructed in 1877. The prison took female convicts until 1922.\n\nFor 20 years, Samuel Webster Allen was the Roman Catholic chaplain at the prison before being made the Bishop of Shrewsbury in 1897. Former Wales Rugby Union international player John Strand-Jones was the part-time Church of England chaplain from 1930 to 1934.\n\nBetween 1902 and 1961 the following seven people were executed by hanging within the walls of HMP Shrewsbury for the crime of murder:-\n\n\nThe names of their victims and their relationships with them appear also. In almost every case the murder victim was female. Executions took place at 8.00 am. All executed prisoners were buried in unmarked graves inside the prison, as was customary. The four executions which took place during the 1950s were all conducted by Albert Pierrepoint and his assistant. The last execution in 1961 was conducted by Harry Allen and his assistant. In February 2014 the Ministry of Justice stated that the remains of ten executed prisoners were exhumed from the prison in 1972, with nine cremated at a local crematorium and the ashes scattered there. The remaining body was handed over to relatives.\n\nIn September 2004, Member of Parliament George Stevenson, called for an enquiry into the number of suicides which had occurred at Shrewsbury Prison. This came after 3 inmates had hanged themselves at the jail in 2 weeks.\n\nA report in 2005 named Shrewsbury prison as the most overcrowded in England and Wales. In August 2008 a further report stated that the prison had 178 places in use but held 326 inmates - an overcrowding rate of 183%. A report in June 2012 by the Prison Reform Trust awarded Shrewsbury second place in England and Wales for overcrowding, holding 326 prisoners in space designed for 170 men, a figure exceeded only by Kennet in Liverpool at the time. In 1934, the prison had contained the larger number of 204 cells.\nBefore closure, Shrewsbury was a Category B/C prison accepting adult males from the local courts in its catchment area. Accommodation at the prison consisted of double occupancy cells in mostly Victorian buildings. The prison offered education and workshops to inmates. A Listener Scheme was also available to prisoners at risk of suicide or self-harm.\n\nIn January 2013, it was announced that the prison was scheduled for closure. The last inmates were transferred from Shrewsbury to other prisons on 27 February 2013, ahead of its closure in March.\n\nThe Grade II listed former prison building was sold by the Ministry of Justice to developers, the Trevor Osborne Property Group, in 2014, and is expected to be converted into homes and offices. In April 2015, it was revealed proposals included accommodation for around 200 students of the recently created University Centre Shrewsbury. In January 2016 formal planning proposals to convert the former prison to flats and student accommodation were submitted but in December 2016 Shropshire Council refused the outline plans, also including restaurants, shops and a gym, on grounds of effects on traffic.\n\nThe prison is mentioned in \"On Moonlit Heath and Lonesome Bank\" which is part of the poem, \"A Shropshire Lad\" by A.E. Housman. The proximity of the prison to Shrewsbury railway station and junction is highlighted in the verse:\n\nSince its closure, in September 2015 it was reported the buildings would be used as a setting for the Sky 1 television drama, \"Lucky Man\" (producer, Carnival Films) being cast as the fictional \"Whitecross Prison\". Filming would take place there for a week.\n\nShrewsbury Prison was used as the filming location of the prison for series 2 of the ITV drama series \"Prey\".\n\nIn 2016, Shrewsbury Prison was featured on a season 2 episode of \"Paranormal Lockdown\" as a haunted location. It also appeared in three \"Most Haunted\" episodes at the end of August and in early September. This was followed by a 2-hour long Halloween special of \"Most Haunted As Live!\" released on 31 October on UKTV Play and shown on 3 November on Really.\n\nIn 2018, the prison was used for the location of Prince Charles' prison cell for the Sky One film, The Queen and I. \n\nIn 2019, the prison was used for episodes of Coronation Street featuring Jack P. Shepherd\n\nIn 2020, the prison features in the final episode of ITV's Bancroft when DCI Elizabeth Bancroft is sent down at the end of the episode.\n\n"}

{"id": "2318207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318207", "title": "Shin'a'in", "text": "Shin'a'in\n\nThe Shin'a'in (translation: \"People of the Plains\") are a fictional ethnographic group created by fantasy author Mercedes Lackey. They comprise roughly half of the descendants of an ancient race, the Kaled'a'in; the other half are the Tale'edras (\"Brothers of the Hawk\"). They are characterized by their chosen homeland, the Dhorisha Plains, an enormous grassland in the bottom of a great crater, and by their refusal to use magic except as part of the shamanic rituals. They resemble the Bedouins in lifestyle; they are nomadic, living in tents, and they are predominantly herders and horse-breeders. \n\nThe Shin'a'in are also traders, and have a semi-permanent settlement, Kata'shin'a'in, on the rim of the Plains. They are characterized by a certain racial type; black-haired, blue-eyed, with golden skin. \n\nShin'a'in worship their deity in the form of a Goddess, Kal'enel (\"Sword of the Stars\", or \"The Star-Eyed\") with four aspects; Maiden, Warrior, Mother, Crone. They also have a male deity who does not appear much in the books. Like the Goddess, he has four aspects that correspond to the four aspects of the Goddess: the Rover, Guardian, Hunter and Guide. \n\nThe Shin'a'in are famous for their relationship to their horses, whom they often refer to as \"dester'edre\" (Wind-born Siblings), or \"ever-younger clanschildren\" (Jel'sutho'edrin).\n\nThe Shin'a'in horses are famous for their quality, especially the warsteeds. A warsteed off the Plains is always female: the Shin'a'in prefer the mares for their intelligence. No Shin'a'in warsteed is ever permitted to belong to a non-Shin'a'in, and they are never sold. Battlemares, as they are known, are distinguished as being ugly, as they are bred for their brains, agility and muscle rather than for looks. In appearance they are somewhat coarse, with large, broad foreheads, dusty gray coats and muscular quarters (the hindquarters often somewhat higher than the forequarters). They are trained to allow only their riders to handle or ride them, and will seriously injure or (more often) kill anybody unauthorized who comes close to them. \n\nThe studs never leave the plains, and the only Shin'a'in horses sold to outsiders are their saddle-beasts and their culls, which are of entirely different breeding stock to the warsteeds (though highly superior to non-Shin'a'in horses).\n\nThe Shin'a'in and Tale'edras became two separate peoples at the Sundering of the Clans, an event remembered with some sorrow. A great war between Urtho, a wise and good mage, and Ma'ar, an evil one, resulted in the death of both and the destruction of their citadels. Ma'ar's fortress became a crater that filled with water and was later named Lake Evendim. Urtho's tower become a massive crater covered in black glass. The Goddess appeared to the Kaled'a'in and gave them two tasks: The Clans who were given the first task were to use magic to restore the damage done to the land through magic; these people became the Tale'edras. The Clans who shunned the use of any magic except for that of the Shaman were to live in the crater and guard the weapons still sealed in Urtho's tower. The clans who accepted the second task became the Shin'a'in, and the Goddess covered the ruined land with grass so that they could live there. This re-populating of the Plains came at a great cost: the lives of the Elders of the four Clans who were the first of the Shin'a'in (Hawk, Wolf, Grass-Cat, and Deer). This gave the Plains their name - the \"Dhorisha Shin'a\", the \"Plains of Sacrifice\".\n\nThere was also a Kaled'a'in clan that had gated so far out from the others that they were considered the Lost Clan, the k'Leshya. The k'Leshya reunited with the others during the Mage Wars and Mage Storms near 2400 years later, per Mercedes Lackey's timelines found in the Valdemar novels.\n\nThe Shin'a'in are organized in Clans named for a totemic animal (Clan of the Cat, Clan of the Hawk, etc. E.g.: Liha'irden as Clan of the Racing Deer, or Tale'sedrin as Children of the Hawk.) They have a clan elder and a shaman (or several shamans) who rule the Clan. The shamans are the only magic users; children born to the Clan who have the ability to use magic must join the shamans or leave the Plains to join Tayledras for training. If they wish to do neither, then the Shaman will call upon the Goddess to seal away the touch of magic and the child will continue to live life in the Clan. \n\nThe Shin'a'in clan has several pivotal members: the Clan Elders, Shaman and Healers, in addition to a Clanmother. Clan is so important to the Shin'a'in that a Shin'a'in Clanless is considered as having no reason to live. They live and die for their Clans.\n\nShamans are the spiritual leaders of the Shin'a'in. They hold a great place of respect within the Clans. They are the keepers of outClan knowledge. Shamans can be distinguished as they wear simple headdress' with two small deer antlers. The Shaman possess their own type of Kal'enedral who instead of warriors are scholars and keepers of knowledge. These Scrollsworn, as they are known, wear a dark navy blue, and are as devoted to the preservation of the Clan and outClan knowledge and history, as the Swordsworn are to the way of the fighting and combat.\n\nA sub-group of Shin'a'in is a class of warriors known as the \"Kal'enedral\" (literally \"Her Sword Brothers\", or \"Sword Sworn\"). Such persons swear an oath to the Goddess for various reasons; one famous Kal'enedral was Tarma shena Tale'sedrin, who took the oath to avenge her Clan after every member but herself was murdered by bandits. \n\nBlood-feud is forbidden amongst the Shin'a'in. In order to pursue blood-feud or revenge, the oath of Kal'enedral must be sworn. This oath is in three parts: first, the Kal'enedral are Sworn to the Goddess of the South Wind and the New Moon (the Warrior), secondly they are Sworn to the service of the Shin'a'in Clans as a whole, and only then are they Sworn to their particular clan. This arrangement precludes inter-clan rivalry, and no Shin'a'in may take up arms against another. \n\nKalen'edral are celibate, entirely without sexual desire (the Goddess removes it to free them from distraction) and are frequently androgynous. Ordinary Kal'enedral dress only in dark brown or black: the black is only worn when on blood-feud or engaging in ritual combat. \n\nKal'enedral continue to serve their Goddess after death; they are \"leshy'a-Kal'enedral\" (spirit-Kal'enedral) and are distinguished by their black clothing, normally only worn when the Kal'enedral is on blood-feud, and veiled faces (giving them the nickname \"the Veiled Ones\"). It is the Veiled Ones who are entrusted with the training of the living Kal'enedral: on every night spent not within the confines of a building, the Veiled Ones will train the Kal'enedral in weapons-work. This makes a Kal'enedral one of the most feared and accomplished warriors in the world.\n\nThe Shin'a'in are notoriously clan-conscious, and do not normally have a great deal of contact with outsiders. Occasionally, however, one will swear the oath of She'enedran (Blood Brother/Sister) with an outlander. \n\nThis oath involves each participant making a small, crescent shaped incision on their right palm and joining hands to mingle the blood. The bond of She'enedran renders the bondmates closer than siblings or lovers, and allows them to feel a little of what the other is feeling (and if one is in danger, the other will know it). \n\nIt was in this way that Tarma shena Tale'sedrin and her She'enedra, the sorceress Kethryveris (Kethry) repopulated the core clan of Tale'sedrin, for by swearing the oath Kethry became Shin'a'in by adoption. Tale'sedrin was repopulated by the children of Kethry and her husband Jadrek, in addition to receiving adoptees from other Clans. From then on, the Tale'sedrin were renowned as being the only Shin'a'in Clan to have blond-haired and/or green-eyed members.\n"}

Through his career he earned commercial as well as critical success, and he remains as an Indian cultural icon.\n\nConsidered as the most popular film star of Bengali cinema, popularly known as \"\"Mahanayak\"\", Kumar managed to have a huge fan following, that mainly concentrated in the regions of West Bengal, India and Bangladesh. He was a recipient of many awards over his lifetime, including National Film Award for Best Actor.Tollygunge Metro station in Kolkata was renamed as Mahanayak Uttam Kumar Metro Station in his honour.\n\nUttam Kumar was born in Kolkata at the home of his maternal uncle at Ahiritola, while his ancestral house is on Girish Mukherjee Road, Bhowanipore. After his schooling in South Suburban School, he went for higher studies in Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration, a college affiliated to the University of Calcutta. He could not complete his studies and started working at the Kolkata Port trust as a clerk. During this period, he acted in amateur theatre groups. His prodigious joint family had its own theatre group, the \"Suhrid Samaj\", which staged many amateur shows. He used to have French wine everyday as suggested by his physician and to hold up his glamour.\n\nUttam Kumar was the eldest of three sons (Arun, Barun and Tarun) of Satkari Chatterjee and Chapala Debi. The youngest, whose screen name was Tarun Kumar, acted in several Bengali films and grew to become an actor of considerable repute, in screen and on stage. There are several films in which Uttam Kumar and Tarun Kumar starred together like \"Saptapadi\", \"Sonar Harin\", \"Maya Mriga\", \"Sesh Anka\", \"Deya Neya\", \"Jeeban-Mrityu\", \"Dhanyi Meye\",\"Mon Niye\", \"Sanyasi Raja\", \"Kamal lata\" and \"Agniswar\". Uttam Kumar married Gauri Debi in 1948. His grandson Gourab Chatterjee is also an actor. Uttam Kumar lived together with Supriya Devi till 1980 following Kumar's death. Pulak Bandyopadhyay, a noted lyricist, was his uncle. Actor Rajesh Khanna once said about Kumar, \"He is the perfect ambassador of Indian cinema. No one carries Indian culture in a Kurta and Dhoti as well as he does.\"\n\nUttam's first release was \"Drishtidan\" (The gift of sight, 1948) directed by Nitin Bose, though he worked in an earlier unreleased film called \"Mayador\" (Embrace of Affection). Then he acted in about four to five films, all of which were flops. In those films he constantly varied his name: Arun Chatterjee, Arun Kumar, Uttam Chatterjee and finally Uttam Kumar. He was dubbed as the 'Flop Master General'. When he entered the studio, people would laugh at him and comment \"Here comes the new Durgadas...\" \"Meet the new Chabbi Biswas..\". He considered leaving the world of cinema and start working at Calcutta Ports. But his wife, Gouri Chatterjee told him that it would be better if he did not to do a job his heart was not in. He later got the contact at M.P. Studios for three years. M.P. studios produced the film \"Basu Paribar\" in which he came into prominence, but his breakthrough film was \"Agni Pariksha\" in 1954, that began the success of the all-time romantic pair of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen, though they had first paired in \"Sharey Chuattor\" (1953). The film ran for 65 weeks and established Uttam in the industry.\n\nOn the background of the mass migration from the then East Pakistan to Calcutta, the Uttam-Suchitra pair gave expression to the yearnings of a new, transformed city. They played out on screen the new desires of a young audience trying to come to terms with industrial modernity and a new form of urban existence. The stylised, black-and-white romanticism of landmark Uttam-Suchitra films of the 1950s like \"Agni Pariksha\", \"Shapmochan\", \"Sagarika\" (1956), \"Shilpi\" (1956), or \"Harano Sur\", \"Indrani\", \"Sabar Uparey\", \"Surjyo Toron\" reflected a novel, youthful urban desire to break free from the confines of the feudal joint family and set up a nucleated, private space for the couple in love. In contrast to the earlier phase of Bengali cinema mostly dominated by the dramatised style of the New Theaters' films (in the 1940s), the Uttam-Suchitra films were marked by a more naturalistic acting style, a bit dramatic-stylized, soft-focus black-and-white cinematography with chiaroscuro effects, and a more popular and modern form of music that broke away more decisively from earlier dependence on classical types. These features were put in place by a new generation of cinematographers like Dinen Gupta and Ajoy Kar, a fresh batch of directors (Kar himself, Sudhir Mukherjee, Naresh Mitra, Sushil Majumdar, the combines of Jatrik and Agradoot) and musicians like Nachiketa Ghosh, Rabin Chattopadhyay, Anupam Ghatak, Hemanta Mukherjee, Anil Bagchi, Sudhin Dasgupta and Salil Chowdhury, along with lyricists like Gauriprasanna Majumdar, Pranab Roy, Pulak Bandopadhyay. A number of them hailed from the left wing Indian People's Theater Association (IPTA) movement, popularly known as \"Gananatya Sangha\".\n\nUttam Kumar was especially adored for his effortless naturalism in front of the camera and a distinctively urbane charisma that broke free from the prototypical Bengali screen hero of the past. He went on to form successful screen pairs with many leading ladies like Suchitra Sen, Supriya Choudhury, Sabitri Chatterjee, Mala Sinha, Madhabi Mukherjee, Sharmila Tagore, Anjana Bhaumick, Tanuja Samarth, Aparna Sen and Sumitra Mukherjee, apart from Sandhyarani in the 50s, Arundhati Devi in the 50s and 60s and Kaberi Bose and Tanuja in the 60s and 70s. He acted in \"Nayak\" by Satyajit Ray in which the master-director scripts the rise of a young actor with an ordinary background to a star sought after by one and all. In fact, this film may be considered as a tribute to Uttam Kumar. Often hailed as the one-man industry, Uttam Kumar dominated Bengali cinema for three decades until his death. This near-total reign was somewhat slightly disturbed during the politically turbulent era of the late sixties up to the Emergency, when Uttam Kumar's regular, politically passive or relatively conservative romantic film persona sometimes found it difficult to fit into the narratives of unrest that came to the fore.\n\nNever quite satisfied with his undisputed matinée idol status, Uttam Kumar started experimenting with character roles early in his career. This was evidenced in films like \"Khokababur Pratyabartan\" (1960), \"Mayamriga\" (1960) or \"Thana Theke Aschi\" (1965) and \"Bicharak\". In \"Marutirtha Hinglaj\" (1959), he played a mentally disturbed character. In \"Kuhak\" he was a murderous thief, while in \"Sesh Anka\", he was a suave businessman who had murdered his wife and was romantically engaged to the daughter of a social elite and rich nobleman. In \"Aparichita\" (1969) he also played the role of a villain. Such departures were unusual in relation to set formats of stardom in Indian popular cinematic cultures, where deviating from established 'star images' were often considered to be risky. However, this brought Uttam Kumar early recognition as a genuine actor of substance apart from a box office superstar and stood him in good stead later, especially in his collaborations with Satyajit Ray in \"Nayak\" (1966) and \"Chiriyakhana\". A perfectionist, Uttam Kumar performed on stage for a full year, opposite Sabitri Chatterjee in Star Theatre in the play \"Shyamali\" (On screen, he played opposite Kaberi Bose) to hone up his skills as an actor.\n\nApart from Bengali, Uttam Kumar also acted in 15 Hindi films such as \"Chhoti Si Mulaqat\" (along with Vyjayanthimala), \"Amanush\", \"Anand Ashram\", \"Dooriyaan\" (with Sharmila Tagore), \"Bandie\" with Sulakshana Pandit and \"Kitaab\" with Vidya Sinha, etc. He was also offered the role of Rajendra Kumar in the Raj Kapoor-starrer film \"Sangam\", but for some reason he refused the role.\n\nPerhaps his most lauded appearance was in Satyajit Ray's \"Nayak\" (The Hero). It is now widely accepted that Ray wrote the script with Uttam in mind. Many people feel the film bears resemblance to Uttam Kumar's own life – the sense of anxiety and restlessness mirrored Uttam's insecurities about his phenomenal success and abiding fear that his superstardom might not last. Uttam made the role of Arindam (Mukherjee) his own and Ray later confessed that if Uttam had refused the film, he would have abandoned it. He worked with Ray the following year in \"Chiriyakhana\" (1967).\n\nUttam also worked with another great film director Tapan Sinha in his film Jhinder Bondi (with another great actor Soumitra chatterjee),\n\nWhen the Indian government instituted the National Film Awards for National Film Award for Best Actor and National Film Award for Best Actress in 1967, Uttam Kumar was the first-ever recipient of the Best Actor Award for his performances in \"Antony Firingee\" and \"Chiriyakhana\" in 1967.\n\nHe explored new avenues of film-making by trying his hand at production, singing, composing music, screenplay writing and directing. The success of his Indian films as producer — \"Harano Sur\", \"Saptapadi\", \"Bhrantibilash\", \"Jotugriha\" (1964), \"Grihadah\" — won greatest acclaim. On producing \"Chhoti Si Mulaqat\" in 1967, which was a Hindi film starring Uttam and Vyjayanthimala, Uttam almost used up all his savings, since the film had to be shot in colour and was shot in extravagant locations. Both Uttam and Vyjayanthimala had huge hopes associated with the film, but the film was a flop leading to great disappointment for Uttam Kumar. It was later said that this flop was one of the main reasons for triggering the heart attack, which ultimately led to his death. Later, Uttam directed much-lauded films such as \"Sudhu Ekti Bochhor\" and \"Bon Palashir Padaboli\". He composed music for the film \"Kaal Tumi Aleya\" in which Hemanta Mukherjee and Asha Bhosle sang to his tune.\n\nHe came out with an authorised biography \"Aamar Ami\" in 1979–80. He had a phenomenal fan base which continues even to this day. In 1960, he started writing an autobiography named \"Harano Dinguli Mor\" (My Bygone Days), but could not complete it. Parts of that book were published by the magazine \"Nabokallol\". On the day Uttam died, the original manuscript was stolen. Later, a member from \"Times of India\" had found the manuscript and the national library helped to find old editions of \"Nabakallol\" and then the incomplete book was finally published in the 37th Calcutta Book Fair. As a singer, he recorded songs for the AIR – All India Radio – and very recently, an album of Tagore songs (Rabindrasangeet) sung by him, has been brought out.\n\nThere was a time, when at the heights of his popularity Uttam Kumar was approached to recite the Chandi Path in the All India Radio (AIR) studios. Traditionally this had always been done by Birendra Krishna Bhadra. But there was a huge uproar amongst the audience as to why Uttam Kumar had been chosen instead of Birendra Krishna. Uttam personally met Mr. Bhadra and apologised and from the next year Mahalaya on AIR was again done by Bhadra.\n\nReruns of his films on television decades after his death are still eagerly watched. Uttam Kumar's time is considered by most as the Golden Era of Bengali cinema.\n\nUttam Kumar was a football lover and was a die hard fan of Mohun Bagan A.C..\n\nLate journalist Randra Trivedi, in his \"Modern Uttam\", explained the incredible bankability of this star. From 1947 to 1980, both in Bengali and Hindi, Uttam Kumar acted in 217 films. In 1947, he got an offer for a brief role in a Hindi film called \"Mayador\". The film never saw the light of day. His first release was the Bengali film \"Drishtidaan\" (1948), directed by Nitin Bose. In the film Uttam was credited as Arun Kumar. The film was a flop. In 1949 he made his debut as the leading man in the film \"Kamona\", crediting him as Uttam Chatterjee. But this too bombed. By then the Industry had labelled him a \"flop master.\" In 1948, he married Gauri Ganguli. Fortunately for Uttam, \"Basu Paribar\" (1952), co-starring Sabitri Chatterjee, was a big hit. Uttam delivered another big hit, \"Sharey Chuattor\" in 1953. After that everything was part of making history. Though trying out in Hindi movies was quite disappointing to him, because of his Bengali accent which did not much impress audiences all over the country. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest actors in the history of Indian cinema and known by the honorific \"Mahanayak\". Through his career, he earned commercial as well as critical success, and he remains a cultural icon.\n\n\n\n\nThe on-screen chemistry between Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen has always been much adored and admired. Both of them together constituted the evergreen and popular romantic pair of Bengali Cinema till date. Some of Uttam's famous films co-starring Suchitra Sen include \"Share Chuattor\", \"Agni Pariksha\", \"Shilpi\", \"Saptapadi\", \"Pathe Holo Deri\", \"Harano Sur\", \"Chaowa Paowa\", \"Bipasha\", \"Jiban Trishna\", \"Sagarika\", \"Trijama\", \"Indrani\", \"Sabar Upare\", \"Surjyo Toron\", \"Rajlakshmi O Sreekanto\", \"Ekti Raat\", \"Grihadaha\", \"Kamallata\", \"Har Mana Har\", \"Alo Amar Alo\".\n\nShonar Harin (1959) saw Supriya Devi (who would win great accolades for her performance in Ritwik Ghatak's \"Meghe Dhaka Tara\" the following year) play the lead opposite Uttam Kumar. As they began to act in more films together, the two got involved off-screen as well. In 1963, Uttam left his family home at Girish Mukherjee Road, Bhowanipur and stayed with Supriya for the next 17 years till his death. They starred together in several other films like \"Uttarayan\", \"Chiradiner\", \"Agni Sanskar\", \"Suno Baranari\", \"Kal Tumi Aleya\", \"Lal Pathor\", \"Andha Atit\", \"Sudhu Ekti Bochhor\", \"Mon Niye\", \"Bilambita Loy\", \"Bhola Maira\", \"Sanyasi Raja\", \"Bon Palashir Padabali\", \"Sister, \"Jibon Mrityue\", \"Bagh Bandir Khela\".\n\nAppreciated by many to be the most talented of Bengali heroines, Sabitri Chatterjee was ardently admired by the Mahanayak as his most powerful heroine. Together, they performed in a number of blockbusters and superhits, a few of which are acclaimed as evergreen comedies. Uttam-Sabitri starrers include \"Abhoyer Biye\", \"Hat Barelei Bandhu\", \"Dui Bhai\", \"Kuhak\", \"Nishi Padma\", \"Manjari Opera\", \"Bhrantibilash\", \"Momer Alo\", \"Kalankita Nayak\" (also starring Aparna Sen), \"Dhanyee Meye\", \"Shes anko\" and \"Mouchak\". In a radio interview, the actress recorded her admiration to Uttam Kumar for taking up challenging roles like that of Raicharan in \"Khokababur Pratyabartan\", the judge in \"Bicharak\" and police officer in \"Thana Theke Aaschhi\" at a time when he was at the height of popularity as a matinee idol of Indian cinema.\n\nA workaholic, he was rumoured to have said that his preferred demise would be on the floor of a studio, doing what he loved best: acting. While filming \"Ogo Bodhu Shundori\" in 1980 Uttam Kumar suffered a stroke and was admitted to the Belle vue Clinic. The doctors did their best for 16 hours but he died that night on 24 July 1980 at the age of 53. As his dead body found its way across Bhowanipur and finally to the Keoratala Burning Ghat, traffic in Kolkata came to a halt as thousands flocked the streets to pay their respects and have a last glimpse of the legend.\n\nTollygunge Metro station in Kolkata was renamed as Mahanayak Uttam Kumar Metro Station in his honour.\nThere is a theatre (Uttam Mancha) named after him in Kolkata. A life-size statue has been erected near Tollygunj metro station which has recently been renamed after the iconic actor by the Central Railway Ministry. Besides, Shilpi Sansad, the actor's pet project of safegurading the artistes especially the poor and the old, is active still. Celebrating the 89th birth anniversary of Uttam Kumar, the Department of Posts in 2009, released a series of new postal stamps featuring the actor on them.The Department of Posts also released a brochure on the Uttam Kumar Stamp release with a note that says \"Uttam Kumar – The Legend of Indian Cinema\". \"The government of India\" release 19 June 2015 \"UTTAM\" AWARD for Best acting. In the year of 2016, a television series called 'Mahanayak' was telecast. It was based on his life.\n\n\n\n"}

She has been a key figure in the revival of Afro-Peruvian music.\n\nIn July 2011, she was named Peru's Minister of Culture in the Ollanta Humala government, becoming the second Afro-Peruvian cabinet minister in the history of independent Peru.\n\nIn November 2011 she was elected to the Organization of American States (OAS) as the President of the Commission of Culture for the period 2011–13.\n\nBaca grew up in a coastal fishing village Chorrillos, a district of the Lima Province of Peru, and part of greater Lima. Her music is a mixture of traditional and contemporary. Her backing band features indigenous Peruvian instruments such as the \"cajón\" (\"wooden box\", whose origins lie in an upturned fruit crate), \"udu\" (clay pot), and \"quijada\" (jawbone of a burro) \"cheko\" a dried gourd, as well as acoustic guitar and electric upright baby bass. Although many of her songs are based on traditional forms such as the \"landó\" or \"vals\", she also incorporates elements of Cuban and Brazilian music. Her debut album for Luaka Bop, produced by Greg Landau, brought her to the attention of World Music audiences worldwide.\n\nBaca is an important figure in the revival of Afro-Peruvian music within Peru (see, for example, dancers from the Perú Negro troupe, as well as \"Festejo\" music), which, like the culture that produced it, had previously been little recognized, but which is now regarded as an important part of Peruvian culture. Baca has contributed much to its international popularity, which began in 1995 with the release of the compilation CD \"\". The album, which features the Baca song \"Maria Lando\", was released by the Luaka Bop record label, which belongs to ex-Talking Heads frontman David Byrne.\n\nAccording to several important critics Baca is more than just an Afro-Peruvian diva.\nMichael Heumann from \"Stylus Magazine\" says: \"Maria Lando put Susana Baca on the world music map. Since then, she has released a number of very popular albums, most on Luaka Bop, and all of incredibly high quality.\"\n\nTimothy G. Merello from \"PopMatters\" said of her performance in Old Town School of Folk Music, Chicago: \"Susana Baca, more than just a singer, is a poet, a historian, a spelunker and explorer of Afro-Peruvian folklore and music [...] she and her band entertain, educate and entrance a sold out crowd with a musical melange of rhythms, melodies, beats, and dance.\"\n\nWhile Deanne Sole, also from \"PopMatters\", says of Baca's 2009 album \"Seis Poemas\" (Six Poems): \"After watching Peruvian singer Susana Baca perform on an open stage in burning heat with malfunctioning equipment, one can't help but respect Baca not only as a voice but as a performer, as a person [...] Seis Poemas, a small album but a charming one.\"\n\nBaca founded the Instituto Negrocontinuo (Black Continuum Institute) in her seafront home in Chorrillos, to foster the collection, preservation and creation of Afro-Peruvian culture, music and dance.\n\nIn 2002, Susana Baca won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album, for her \"Lamento Negro\" CD besides a nomination for the Grammy as \"Best World Music Album\".\n\nIn November 2011 she won the second Latin Grammy of her career for her collaboration with urban group Calle 13 on the song \"Latinoamérica\", which was recorded in Peru, also featuring Brazilian singer-songwriter Maria Rita and Colombian recording artist Totó la Momposina.\n\nIn July 2011 the newly elected President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, announced that Baca would become his Minister of Culture. On 28 July she was sworn in, becoming the second Afro-Peruvian cabinet minister in the history of independent Peru. She resigned due to a cabinet reshuffle on 11 December 2011.\n\nIn November 2011 she was elected to the Organization of American States (OAS) as President of the Commission of Culture for the period 2011–13.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2318261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318261", "title": "Private Use Areas", "text": "Private Use Areas\n\nIn Unicode, a Private Use Area (PUA) is a range of code points that, by definition, will not be assigned characters by the Unicode Consortium. Three private use areas are defined: one in the Basic Multilingual Plane (codice_1–codice_2), and one each in, and nearly covering, planes 15 and 16 (codice_3–codice_4, codice_5–codice_6). The code points in these areas cannot be considered as standardized characters in Unicode itself. They are intentionally left undefined so that third parties may define their own characters without conflicting with Unicode Consortium assignments. Under the Unicode Stability Policy, the Private Use Areas will remain allocated for that purpose in all future Unicode versions.\n\nAssignments to Private Use Area characters need not be \"private\" in the sense of strictly internal to an organisation; a number of assignment schemes have been published by several organisations. Such publication may include a font that supports the definition (showing the glyphs), and software making use of the private-use characters (e.g. a graphics character for a \"print document\" function). By definition, multiple private parties may assign different characters to the same code point, with the consequence that a user may see one private character from an installed font where a different one was intended.\n\nUnder the Unicode definition, code points in the Private Use Areas are assigned characters—they are not noncharacters, reserved, or unassigned. Their category is \"codice_7\", and no character names are specified. No representative glyphs are provided, and character semantics are left to private agreement. Private-use characters are assigned Unicode code points whose interpretation is not specified by this standard and whose use may be determined by private agreement among cooperating users. These characters are designated for private use and do not have defined, interpretable semantics except by private agreement.\nNo charts are provided for private-use characters, as any such characters are, by their very nature, defined only outside the context of this standard.\n\nIn the Basic Multilingual Plane (plane 0), the block titled Private Use Area has 6400 code points. Planes 15 and 16 are almost entirely assigned to two further Private Use Areas, Supplementary Private Use Area-A and Supplementary Private Use Area-B respectively.\n\nIn order to encode characters from planes 15 and 16 in UTF-16, a further block of the BMP is assigned to High Private Use Surrogates (U+DB80..U+DBFF, 128 code points).\n\nMany people and institutions have created character collections for the PUA. Some of these private use agreements are published, so other PUA implementers can aim for unused or less used code points to prevent overlaps. Several characters and scripts previously encoded in private use agreements have actually been fully encoded in Unicode, necessitating mappings from the PUA to other Unicode code points.\n\nOne of the more well-known and broadly implemented PUA agreements is maintained by the ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR). The CSUR, which is not officially endorsed or associated with the Unicode Consortium, provides a mapping for constructed scripts, such as Klingon pIqaD and Ferengi script (Star Trek), Tengwar and Cirth (J.R.R. Tolkien's cursive and runic scripts), Alexander Melville Bell's Visible Speech, and Dr. Seuss' alphabet from \"On Beyond Zebra\". The CSUR previously encoded the undeciphered Phaistos characters, as well as the Shavian and Deseret alphabets, which have all been accepted for official encoding in Unicode.\n\nAnother common PUA agreement is maintained by the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative (MUFI). This project is attempting to support all of the scribal abbreviations, ligatures, precomposed characters, symbols, and alternate letterforms found in medieval texts written in the Latin alphabet. The express purpose of MUFI is to experimentally determine which characters are necessary to represent these texts, and to have those characters officially encoded in Unicode. As of Unicode version 5.1, 152 MUFI characters have been incorporated into the official Unicode encoding.\n\nSome agreed-upon PUA character collections exist in part or whole because Unicode Consortium is in no hurry to encode them. Some, such as unrepresented languages, are likely to end up encoded in the future. Some unusual cases such as fictional languages are outside the usual scope of Unicode but not explicitly ruled out by the principles of Unicode, and may show up eventually (such as the Star Trek and Tolkien writing systems). In other cases, the proposed encoding violates one or more Unicode principles and hence is unlikely to ever be officially recognized by Unicode—mostly where users want to directly encode alternate forms, ligatures, or base-character-plus-diacritic combinations (such as the TUNE scheme).\n\n\nInformally, the range U+F000 through U+F8FF is known as Corporate Use Area.\n\nThere are three PUA blocks in Unicode.\n\nThe concept of reserving specific code points for Private Use is based on similar earlier usage in other character sets. In particular, many otherwise obsolete characters in East Asian scripts continue to be used in specific names or other situations, and so some character sets for those scripts made allowance for private-use characters (such as the user-defined planes of CNS 11643, or \"gaiji\" in certain Japanese encodings). The Unicode standard references these uses under the name \"End User Character Definition\" (EUCD).\n\nAdditionally, the C1 control block contains two codes intended for private use \"control functions\" by ECMA-48: 0x91 (PU1) and 0x92 (PU2). Unicode includes these at and but defines them as control characters (category codice_27), not private-use characters (category codice_28).\n\nEncodings which do not have private use areas but have more or less unused areas, such as ISO/IEC 8859 and Shift JIS, have seen uncontrolled variants of these encodings evolve. For Unicode, software companies can use the Private Use Areas for their desired additions.\n"}

One year earlier, 170 experts met in Brussels, invited by the Commission, to analyse the European dependence on the American GPS system, but also to gather civilian applications propositions.\n\nIn 2001, the project was first presented as a European calling system, in the context of the German youth science competition Jugend forscht.\n\nIn 2007, the project was postponed.\n\nIn 2011, the project was pushed again by the European Commission.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, the project was adopted and was scheduled to be completed by 1 October 2015.\n\nOn 6 September 2013 trade associations operating in the automotive after market (like AIRC, CLEPA, FIA, FIGEAFA) welcomed the European Commission’s eCall initiative and fully support the Europe-wide mandatory introduction of eCall by 2015 in all new type-approved cars and light commercial vehicles. AIRC (Association des Reparateurs en Carrosserie) General Secretary Karel Bukholczer said that eCall represents an important initiative to reduce fatalities and the severity of injuries on Europe’s roads.\n\nSlovenia introduced eCall in December 2015. Italy deployed a pilot program in selected regions in May 2017, and Sweden adopted eCall in October 2017.\n\nThe deployment of eCall devices was made mandatory in all new cars sold in the European Union on April 1, 2018.\n\nIP-based emergency services mechanisms is introduced to support the next generation of the Pan-European in-vehicle emergency call service on May 2017. \n\nThe Recommendation identifies requirements of an Internet of things (IoT)-based automotive emergency response system (AERS), \"i.e.\" eCall, for aftermarket devices on March 2018.\n\nThe eCall initiative aims to deploy a device installed in all vehicles that will automatically dial 112 in the event of a serious road accident, and wirelessly send airbag deployment and impact sensor information, as well as GPS or Galileo coordinates to local emergency agencies. A manual call button is also provided. eCall builds on E112. According to some estimates, eCall could reduce emergency response times by 40 percent in urban areas and by 50 percent in rural areas.\n\nMany companies are involved with telematics technology to use in different aspects of eCall including in-vehicle systems, wireless data delivery, and public safety answering point systems. Standardization of communication protocols and human language issues are some of the obstacles. Prototypes have been successfully tested with GPRS and in-band signalling over cellular networks. At the same time proprietary eCall solutions that rely on SMS exist already today from car makers such as BMW, PSA and Volvo Cars. Once in active deployment, other telematic services such as route advisories and traffic information are expected to explode.\n\nThe project is also supported by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), an interest group of European car, bus, and truck manufacturers, and ERTICO. Many of the stakeholder companies involved with telematics technology have membership in ERTICO or ACEA. An advantage of this membership is increased ability to influence developing eCall standards.\n\nAs with all schemes to add mandatory wireless transceivers to cars, there are privacy concerns to be addressed. Depending on the final implementation of the system, it may be possible for the system to become activated without an actual crash taking place. Also, the occupants of the car have no control over the remote activation of the microphone, making a car susceptible to eavesdropping.\n\nIn Russia, a fully interoperable system called ERA-GLONASS is being deployed, with the aim to require an eCall terminal and a GPS/GLONASS receiver in new vehicles by 2015-2017. As ERA-GLONASS was the first system started to operate eCall is based on its technology.\n\nIn North America, a similar service is available from GM via their OnStar service, and by Ford with \"Sync with Emergency Assistance\".\n\n\n"}

It opened in 1835, and closed in 1944, although the main line of the Shropshire Union Canal still runs through it.\n\nThe Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal was authorised by an act of Parliament in 1825, to create a link between the southern end of the Ellesmere and Chester Canal at Nantwich and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Autherley Junction. Thomas Telford was the engineer, and the canal was one of a new generation of canals which used cuttings and embankments to follow a relatively straight line across the countryside, unlike earlier canals which often followed tortuous paths as they followed the contours. Norbury was a little over half way towards Autherley, and to the north, the canal passed through the deep Grub Street Cutting. To the south, Telford's preferred route could not be followed, as Lord Anson objected to it passing through parts of his estate. The only option was a massive embankment, which starts just below the site of the junction, and is punctured by two road tunnels. Shelmore embankment proved difficult to engineer, as the marl soil used to build it kept slipping. It was the last part of the canal to be completed, as it took five and a half years to build, and was not finished until January 1835, six months after Telford had died.\n\nThe Shrewsbury Canal was authorised in 1793, and connected Shrewsbury to the Wombridge Canal at Trench, passing through Wappenshall and up an inclined plane to reach Trench. It was part of a small network of canals in East Shropshire, which were isolated from the main canal network of the time. A meeting was held between the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal and the Shrewsbury Canal in 1827, at which the idea of a link was formulated, but the engineering problems on the main line meant that no progress was made until 1831. The link from Wappenshall Junction to Newport was opened in January 1835, and the final section, which included a flight of seventeen locks up to Norbury Junction, opened in March, along with the main line. It became part of the Shropshire Union network in 1846, after the Ellesmere and Chester company merged with the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction company, and took over most of the East Shropshire network.\n\nThe junction continued in operation until 1944, when the Shrewsbury Canal, along with much of the Shropshire Union network, was abandoned as a result of an Act of abandonment obtained by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, which had owned the canals since 1922.\n\nThe small settlement by the junction is named after the canal junction. The first lock on the Newport Branch has been turned into a dry-dock. There is a pub, the \"Junction Inn\", a boatyard with full facilities for boaters, including the \"Old Wharf Tearoom\", and a Canal & River Trust maintenance depot.\n\nThe junction site is situated in the middle of a long level pound. To the north, it stretches for to Tyrley Top Lock, the first of 25, arranged as two flights of five and a flight of fifteen, which descend to Nantwich, while to the south it is to Wheaton Aston lock, which raises the canal level a little and is the only lock before the stop lock at the junction at Atherley. A very short section of the Shrewsbury Canal remains, up to the dry dock, which is used as private moorings by the boatyard.\n\nSince 2004, the Shrewsbury & Newport Canals Trust has teamed up with the Norbury village community and the Junction Inn to jointly organise the May Bank Holiday Canal Festival. During the festival, there is a gathering of boat traders, modern narrowboats and restored working boats, and people visiting have the opportunity to look inside some of the boats to see what life is like on board.\n\nThe festival includes stalls, refreshments and boat trips along the canal, and for the last couple of years Windmill Broadcasting has been at the event, along with a fairground, bouncy castle and WI tea stall.\n\n\n\n"}

As a child, he was well known for making up long stories and tales. In such situations, his mother used to make him play the \"quiet game\", where he had to see how long he could go without talking. He also recalled that despite being a loving mother, she was also very tough. One phrase she would lovingly use was, \"I love you, now get out.\"\n\nGalecki made his acting debut in the 1987 CBS miniseries \"Murder Ordained\" with JoBeth Williams and future \"Roseanne\" co-star John Goodman.

In late 2006 and early 2007, Galecki appeared in the Broadway play \"The Little Dog Laughed\" as a prostitute called Alex. \"At its core, the play is about what we all sacrifice to be successful, whatever our careers or goals,\" he explains. Galecki originated the role earlier in 2006 at Second Stage Theatre. The widely popular comedy by Douglas Carter Beane had a successful run at Second Stage and moved to the Cort Theatre. The play closed on February 18, 2007, with Galecki taking home a 2007 Theater World Award for his performance.\n\nGalecki played Leonard Hofstadter in the CBS sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory\", which debuted September 24, 2007. He was originally asked to play the role of Sheldon Cooper, but he said he was better suited for the role of Leonard Hofstadter, and Sheldon's role was eventually given to Jim Parsons.

It stars Hilary Duff, Heather Locklear, Ben Feldman and Chris Noth. Shooting for the film began in May 2004. The film was a critical and commercial failure.\n\nTeenager Holly Hamilton (Duff) is tired of moving every time her single mom Jean (Locklear) is through with her latest mistake of a man. To prevent her mother from making another bad decision, Holly has an idea: create a secret admirer who is the perfect man. However, things spin out of control and Holly has to improvise.\n\nSingle mother Jean relocates every time she gets her heart broken by another guy, much to the dismay of her teenage daughter, Holly. Holly devises a plan to invent a secret admirer for her mother, so she will be happy and not have to relocate anymore. Holly overhears her friend Amy's uncle Ben ordering flowers for a woman, and decides to use his advice on women (which she acquires by telling him she needs help for a school project on romance). Following Ben's advice, she sends her mother orchids and other gifts and love notes, and is soon communicating with her mother as this fictitious admirer (who Holly names Ben) via the Internet. As her mother becomes more interested, Holly has to find a photo of this admirer. She sends one of the real Ben, and then devises a reason why they cannot meet in person, claiming he is working in China.\nWhile she is developing the online romance between her mother and fake Ben, and preventing her mother and the real Ben from meeting in person, she finds herself drawn to a cute, artistic boy in her class, Adam, but is unwilling to get close to anyone due to her history of being uprooted and having to say goodbye so often.\n\nAs the charade continues, and as Holly spends more time with Ben while picking his brain for romance tips, she slowly begins to see qualities in Ben which make her believe he is her mother's \"perfect man\". Holly asks for Adam's help to disguise as Ben in the telephone and break up with Jean. But he fails, as he is revealed to be harboring feelings for Holly as well, in effect telling Holly's mother the opposite of what is planned.\n\nThe following day at school, Holly confronts Adam angrily because of his failed attempt to disguise as Ben and break up with her mother over the phone did not go according to plan. Adam apologizes and tells Holly that he just got distracted. Holly demands to know what he could have possibly been distracted by and Adam admits his feelings for Holly by kissing her. That night, Lenny, a man who is infatuated with Jean, proposes to her and she replies with a \"maybe\". Holly, in an act of desperation, then disguises herself as Ben's secretary and arranges a meeting between Ben and her mother. The next day, when Holly mistakenly thinks Ben is marrying someone else, she disrupts the wedding to tell Ben he should be with her mother, not knowing he was there because the bride is his dear friend and he was catering the wedding. A disappointed Ben follows her out and she admits the full story. Holly then goes to the meeting place and admits the whole ruse to Jean, who seems to take it terribly. Days pass by and Holly and her mother maintain a cold relationship, and Holly is offended by her interpretation of Adam's drawing of \"Princess Holly\". Holly begs Jean for them to move again. Her mother is humiliated and wants to stay, but Holly tells her to leave this once for herself, as she always has to move for her mother. Her mother cannot argue with that so they start to pack. Adam, for what he thinks is the last time, goes to Holly's home and gives Holly's mother his drawing, commenting that the drawing has another side that Holly did not see before she left, which turns out to be Adam telling Holly that he will always be there for her.\n\nTouched, Jean logs onto the Internet using Holly's screen name and talks to Adam. Adam, thinking it is Holly, says that her mom is setting a bad example, getting up and leaving when things get bad and that, in return, is making a bad role model for her own daughters. Jean is deeply moved by this and decides to stay, finding a new job and trying to rebuild her life without running away. She also apologizes to her daughter and tells her to look at the other side of the drawing, making Holly happy.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben is inspired by what Holly told him about her mother, and with Holly's help, Jean and Ben finally meet and Jean finds her \"perfect man\" at last. Holly is on the road to her perfect man as well since she has some stability in her life and finally opens up and admits her feelings for Adam. At the end, Adam and Holly go to their first school dance together.\n\n\nShooting for the film began in May 2004 and was based on screenwriter Heather Robinson's life in Tucson, Arizona. Carson Kressley missed two days of shooting on his reality makeover show, \"Queer Eye\", due to filming on \"The Perfect Man\" overrunning. \"Queer Eye\" explained his absence by claiming the fashion expert was busy shopping. On the weekends, Duff was busy recording songs for her then-upcoming self-titled album.\n\nRotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 6% based on 115 reviews. The critical consensus describes the film as \"a lifeless, occasionally creepy movie that gives romantic comedies a bad name\".\nMetacritic rated the film as having \"generally unfavorable reviews\" and gave the film a score of 27% based on a normalized average of 29 reviews.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $5,300,980 million in 2,087 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking number eight at the box office, the best debut for a teen comedy film that week. By the end of its run, \"The Perfect Man\" grossed $16,535,005 domestically and $3,235,470 internationally, totaling $19,770,475 worldwide.\n\nThe Perfect Man (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the soundtrack album to the film of the same name, released on June 14, 2005, by independent label Curb Records.\n\n2007 Teen Choice Awards\n\n2005 Golden Raspberry Awards\n\n"}

She won the London Film Critics Circle Award for British Actress of the Year for the film \"The Mother\" (2003).\n\nReid was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, the daughter of Colin Norman Reid (1896–1979) and Annie Eliza Weetman Reid (1896–1980). She lived with her parents and three older brothers in Redcar, where she attended John Emmerson Batty primary school and the White House School. From the age of 11 she attended Penrhos College, a boarding school in North Wales, when her father was posted abroad as a foreign correspondent for the \"Daily Telegraph\": she visited her parents occasionally in India, Tehran and Beirut in the school holidays. Upon leaving school she moved to London to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She then became a stage manager and worked in repertory theatre.\n\nAlthough she had already appeared in other television programmes including \"The Benny Hill Show\" (1957), \"Hancock's Half Hour\" (1957) and \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1958), Reid's first major acting role was as the character of Valerie Tatlock (later Barlow) on \"Coronation Street\". Her character was very popular with the show's fans; as such, Valerie's marriage to Ken Barlow can be seen as an early example of a soap supercouple.\n\nValerie was the mother of the twins Susan and Peter. Reid joined the cast, initially for two months, starting in August 1961 and leaving in October. She returned to the programme to marry Ken on 1 August 1962, in a wedding watched by 15.8 million viewers. In 1965, Val and Ken had twins, and Granada Television received numerous congratulation gifts addressed to the couple.\n\nIn 1968, Reid played one of her most difficult parts in \"Coronation Street\" when Val was held hostage by a rapist. Although Val was not harmed, viewers sent in hate mail to the actor who played the rapist. In November 1970, Reid announced she was leaving \"Coronation Street\". In a 2011 interview with the \"Radio Times\", Reid said she had had enough and wanted to do other things:\n\nI was a basket case when I left! I'd already had too much of it. That kind of work suits some people, but it didn't suit me. It was my decision to leave and I was desperate, really desperate, to go. Because I knew I was good at comedy and there was no way that Valerie Barlow was ever going to be funny.\n\nOn 27 January 1971, 18.26 million viewers watched as Valerie Barlow was written out, dying after being electrocuted by a hairdryer with a faulty plug. On 3 February 1971, the character's funeral was shown and 18.92 million people watched.\n\nFollowing a break from acting to bring up her son, during which time she made occasional TV appearances for Granada, such as in \"Crown Court\", Reid resumed her career on stage and television in the 1980s.

Its headmaster, Richard Marshall, is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.\n\nIt was founded in 1877 as a boarding school for boys by the United Methodist Free Church, and incorporated Elmfield College and New College, Harrogate in the 1930s. It is now open to non-Methodists and to those of non-Christian religions. The college accepted girls in 1982 and is fully co-educational. It thrives as the oldest independent school in Harrogate and owns an estate of 60 acres on the south side of the spa town.\n\nIn 1875 the United Methodist Free Church Assembly agreed to establish a college that promoted a sound and advanced education. A set of six committee members were appointed to search for suitable premises and thereafter became the founding fathers of the school: Alderman R. Ellis, Rev. E. Boaden, Rev. R. Chew, Rev. J. Garside, W. H. C. Hardy and Rev. K. Kirksop. Ald. Ellis found a small private school and estate called Ashville on the outskirts of Harrogate and purchased it for £5,800. Dr William Richardson was appointed as headmaster and the school opened on 17 July 1877 with 30 pupils and two masters, with school fees being £25 per annum.\n\nIn 1889 the school underwent a period of expansion which began with the opening of the East Wing in order to house more boys. By 1902 the school site included a cricket pavilion, tennis courts and a gymnasium. The school's clock tower was built in 1911. \n\nIn World War I, 300 of the school's pupils were called up and 38 died in the conflict, including 8 who died in the Battle of the Somme. In 1921 a cenotaph was built, funded by the Old Boys' Association.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s the school underwent further expansion to include the Memorial Hall, Library, Music Rooms and an open-air swimming pool.\n\nIn 1929 Ashville purchased New College, Harrogate for £40,000 which included 27 acres of land. In 1932 the school merged with Elmfield College bringing its student population to 280 boys and making Ashville the largest private school in the north of England. \n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Ashville was requisitioned to the Royal Air Force and the school was evacuated to The Hydro Hotel in Bowness-on-Windermere. During the war 465 of the school's pupils volunteered for the forces, 59 were killed and 90 decorations were awarded to Old Ashvillians. The school did not return to its original site in Harrogate until 1946.\n\nIn 1982 girls were admitted to the school for the first time, initially only as day pupils until 1989 when the girls' boarding house was opened.\n\nEllis (Green), Riverdale (Red), Duckworth (Yellow), Windermere (Blue)\n\nIn December 2018, Ashville College was officially accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC).

The Cessna 185 is a high-winged aircraft with non-retractable conventional landing gear and a tailwheel.\n\nOver 4,400 were built with production ceasing in 1985. When Cessna re-introduced some of its most popular models in the 1990s, the tailwheel equipped Cessna 180 and 185 were not put back into production.\n\nThe aircraft is basically a Cessna 180 with a strengthened fuselage. The main difference between the two aircraft is the larger vertical fin on the 185 and the 300 hp (224 kW) Continental IO-520-D engine as opposed to the 230 hp (172 kW) Continental O-470-S fitted to the Cessna 180. The exception was that a Continental Motors IO-470-F engine of 260 hp (194 kW) was initially fitted until midway through the 1966 production year. The later model Skywagon II has a factory fitted avionics package.\nThe Skywagon can also be fitted with floats, amphibious float, or skis.

The A 3 is a major connection between the Rhine-Ruhr area and southern Germany, resulting in heavy traffic. Consequently, large parts have three lanes (plus a hard shoulder) in each direction, including a 300 km (187.5 mi) section between Oberhausen and Aschaffenburg.\n\nThe A3 passes by the Frankfurt Airport.\n\nThe A 3 begins at the border crossing Elten in North Rhine-Westphalia as a four-lane continuation of the Dutch A 12. Until Oberhausen the highway runs on the right bank of the Lower Rhine past the cities Emmerich, Wesel and Dinslaken and reaches the Ruhrgebiet. At Kreuz Oberhausen you have to change the carriageway to stay on the A 3, as the continuous driving direction to the south forms the A 516 which starts here to the center of Oberhausen or to the east towards the A 2 towards Berlin. From here the A 3 is six lanes developed. The cities of Oberhausen, Duisburg, are linked by the western Ruhr area parallel to the A 59 between Dinslaken and Düsseldorf, as well as Ratingen and the east-west highways A 42, A 40 and A 52, before the capital city of Düsseldorf is bypassed with greater distance east. In the further course up to the cross Leverkusen the A 3 runs parallel to the federal highway 59 which forms an alternative route between the cities Cologne and Duesseldorf. From Leverkusen, where the A 1 (Fehmarn-Saarbrücken) is crossed, the A 3 forms the eastern Cologne Ring. Due to the very high volume of traffic, this section is often congested, which is why a section between Cologne-Mülheim and the Heumar triangle has been expanded to eight lanes. Between Cologne-Ost and Heumarer Dreieck, the A 4 (Aachen-Olpe) runs on a common route with the A 3. After Cologne, the motorway again six lanes and affects the city of Siegburg, where at the interchange Bonn / Siegburg the A 560 is connected to Bonn. Then the landscape becomes hilly, the Siebengebirge and the Westerwald are reached and the motorway changes to Rhineland-Palatinate.\n\nAs far as the Rhine-Main area, the motorway is marked by numerous gradients and gradients, the best known are in the Hallerbachtal and Elzer Berg. Also runs largely parallel to the 2002 completed ICE high-speed line Cologne -Rhine-Main. At the triangle Dernbach, not far from Koblenz, the A48 branches off to Trier. Then the Westerwald district town of Montabaur is connected before the Limburg area and thus Hesse is reached. The local Lahntalbrücke also serves local traffic and was replaced in 2016 by a new building with eight lanes. Then the route leads over the Taunus into the plain of the Rhine-Main area. At the Wiesbadener Kreuz the A66 is crossed, which connects the two largest cities of the region, Frankfurt am Main and the provincial capital Wiesbaden. After crossing the Main on the Mainbrücke Raunheim, the A67 branches off at the Mönchhof-Dreieck, forming a route to Stuttgart as well as to Switzerland. Immediately thereafter, the A 3 crosses the grounds of Frankfurt Airport, the largest in Germany. Two runway bridges connect the northwest runway to the north of the highway. Also, the airport's ICE station is just north of the A 3, which cross pedestrians on a bridge to get from the station to the terminals. Afterwards, the most frequented German motorway interchange, the Frankfurter Kreuz, will pass through, connecting the A 5 (Kassel-Basel).\n\nUntil Aschaffenburg a large forest area is passed through. First, Frankfurt will drive around eight lanes south. The Frankfurt-Süd junction, which is located near the stadium, is the only direct link with Frankfurt. At the Offenbacher Kreuz the A 661, which bypasses Frankfurt to the east, closes. This is followed by the six-lane route again the northern cities of Offenbach am Main, Hanau and Seligenstadt, which are also connected with one connection point. In the middle of the Seligenstädter Triangle, which marks the end of the A 45 from Dortmund, the state border with Bavaria runs. The Main is again crossed on the Mainbrücke Stockstadt and Aschaffenburg and the suburbs Goldbach and Hösbach, in whose local layers two noise protection enclosures were built, tied. From the community Weibersbrunn the track is four-lane, but is expanded since 2014, and leads across the heights of the Spessart.\n\nBehind the third Main Crossing on the Main Bridge Bettingen the highway runs on an approximately six-kilometer section through Baden-Württemberg. Shortly before Helmstadt, the highway is again six lanes and bypasses Würzburg south, after the triangle Würzburg-West, the A 81 branches off to Stuttgart. South of Würzburg the Main is crossed on the Mainbrücke Randersacker a fourth time. Then follows the cross Biebelried, which crosses the A 7 (Flensburg-Füssen), before the A 3 is back four-lane, crosses the Main on the Main bridge Dettelbach near Kitzingen for a fifth time and continues towards Nuremberg. This section leads through the Steigerwald and is characterized by a high traffic volume. Passing Höchstadt and Erlangen, Nuremberg is bypassed northeast. When Erlangen crosses the A 73 (Feucht-Suhl). The motorway crosses the Nuremberg Reichswald, in which two motorway junctions lie, which connect the A 3 with the A 9 (Berlin-Munich) and the A 6 (Saarbrücken-Prague).\nBehind Nuremberg, past Neumarkt in the Upper Palatinate, crossed the Franconian Alb and reached the Danube valley at Regensburg. To Passau, the highway runs parallel to the river past Straubing and Deggendorf (A 92 to Munich), after which the first heights of the Bavarian Forest are crossed. At Passau, the route turns south, passes through the Neuburg Forest and crosses the Inn, the border between Germany and Austria. Continuation of the road on the Austrian side is the Innkreisautobahn A 8, which continues to Linz.\n\nThe first plans for the northern section between Emmerich and Oberhausen, the so-called \"Holland line\" (Reichsautobahnstrecke 92), date to the year 1936. Despite difficulties in the route definition (industrial areas in Oberhausen and Dinslaken are crossed) was already in July 1939 with the construction to be started. Because of the Second World War, the construction work had to be stopped in October of the same year until July 1940. . Up to about a third of the earthworks were completed. The route was already cleared and construction had started on 29 buildings\n\nThe first plans for the Cologne-Düsseldorf route go back to 1925. In 1929 the Provincial Association of the Prussian Rhine Province legally established the route between Cologne-Düsseldorf and in 1931 the construction started of a 2.5-kilometer section at Opladen. I was opened on 27 September 1933 and shortened the section of trunk road 8 between the two cities. The southern part of this route was not further upgraded and included in a simple bypass, now part of the B 8 / L 288 (Bonner road).\n\nIn the years up to 1940, the rest of the Reichsautobahn Oberhausen (following the A 2) was built over Cologne to Wiesbaden sections. The 25-kilometer section from Cologne-Mülheim to Mettmann was opened on May 21, 1936 to traffic. In the same year, the section from Breitscheid to Oberhausen-Lirich / Duisburg-Meiderich was completed in the northerly direction. In 1937, the northern continuation of the current motorway junction Oberhausen and the gap closure between Mettmann and Breitscheid followed.\n\nThe southern route allowed the direction Reichsautobahnen simultaneously from both Cologne in the south and Wiesbaden in the north. The section between the interchange Köln-Mülheim and Siegburg 30 km in length was handed over on December 17, 1937 after about three years of construction time traffic. One year later, on 15 December 1938, the 12 km section was taken to the junction Siebengebirge and on 20 September 1939 followed by another 30 km to Dierdorf.\n\nThe southern section with 48 km length between the former junction Wiesbaden, today's Wiesbadener Kreuz, and the junction Limburg-Nord was opened on 23 September 1939 traffic. The most elaborate structure in this section was the then approximately 500 m long and 60 m high Lahntalbrücke. The 41.5 km long gap between Limburg and Dierdorf took place on 15 June 1940. The construction of the section south of the Wiesbadener cross with the Main Bridge between Raunheim and Eddersheim was started in 1938, but had to be discontinued in early 1943. The section from Erlangen to the Nuremberg junction was completed in 1941, partly in one lane.\n\nIn 1937, planning for the motorway section from Nuremberg via Regensburg to Passau was begun. In the area between Nuremberg and Oberpfraundorf, however, a different route was chosen than the later built. The original route led over the area of the enlarged military training area Hohenfels after the Second World War. Also, in contrast to today running south of the city A 3 Deggendorf north should be bypassed. After 1939 already in some sections on the Franconian Alb and Wörth on the Danube and Deggendorf with earthworks and bridge construction work was started, they stopped the work, as on the northern section, 1942 due to the war. In the course of this work, the construction of a Danube bridge near Regensburg was started.\n\nAfter the war, in 1958 with the continuation of construction of the line Emmerich-Oberhausen (\"Holland Line\") started. In 1961, the 17,5 km long section from the cross Oberhausen to Wesel was completed. Already two years earlier, in 1959, the construction of the \"Zubringers Oberhausen\" as the southern extension of the road to the B 223 (today's A 516) began. Also the 7.2 km long section between the border crossing Elten and Emmerich has already been built. This was then in an area that was still under Dutch administration until 1962, the construction was in collaboration with the Dutch Road Administration. The road cross section, however, corresponded to the German standard. The construction work was completed in 1962 and completed the section.\n\nIn 1963, both the \"Oberhausen connection\" south of the Oberhausen cross and the section between Wesel and Hamminkeln were released. The total distance from Oberhausen to the Dutch border was completed in 1965.\nIn June 1950, the construction work on the motorway south of Wiesbaden was resumed. The completion of the 3.5 km section to Weilbach was 1951, the following 17.4 km to Frankfurt-South were inaugurated on 10 July 1956. This was near the Frankfurt Rhein-Main airport for linking with the Federal Highway 5, the Frankfurter Kreuz and thus the first motorway junction in West Germany.\n\nThe 214 km section from Frankfurt to Erlangen-Tennenlohe was built within nine years. The total cost amounted to about one billion DM. During construction, 21 construction workers were killed. From 15 December 1959, the highway with the maximum four percent steep Spessart climb to Rohrbrunn was passable. The traffic clearance to Würzburg-West followed on October 27, 1961. On the way to the Nuremberg area was gradually built in the next few years. The 42 km long piece of the gap between Rottendorf and Schlüsselfeld was handed over to traffic on November 26, 1964. The line was equipped with a total of 54 rest stops in the direction of Nuremberg and 64 in the direction of Frankfurt as well as four rest stops. Between Aschaffenburg and Würzburg 11 springs and wells were offered to motorists.\n\nFrom Tennenlohe to the cross Nuremberg, the highway was already passable in 1941, but only in the section AS Nuremberg / Behringersdorf to AS Nürnberg-Mögeldorf two lanes. The complete release for this area could take place only 1959. The route was from 19 December 1963 from Nuremberg to Schlüsselfeld passable.\n\nAfter the plans for the motorway section Nuremberg-Regensburg-Passau were resumed in 1958, due to the training area Hohenfels the originally planned and partly built track could not be further developed, they decided on a route through Altorf, Neumarkt and Parsberg, the at Oberpfraundorf again on the prewar road encounters. This could be largely retained in the course.\n\nThe 25.5 km long section Nittendorf-Rosenhof could be completed as early as 1965, the western adjoining, 25 km long section Parsberg-Nittendorf 1969. In 1971, the A 3 in the direction of Nuremberg was already passable for another 27.6 km to Neumarkt. Since then, the motorway from the Dutch border to the east of Regensburg (junction Rosenhof) was continuously passable.\n\nIn 1968 the construction of the motorway between Deggendorf and Passau began. The 20 km long section from the motorway intersection Deggendorf to Iggensbach was completed in 1975, followed in 1978 by the subsequent approximately 21 km long route to the junction Passau -Nord and in 1979 another 9 km to Passau-Süd together with the Danube bridge Schalding. In 1983, the motorway section between Passau-South and the Austrian border was completed.\n\nBetween Regensburg and Deggendorf was only built in the late 1970s to early 1980s. In 1980, the A 3 of Rosenhof was extended by 9 km to Wörth on the Danube, with a further Danube crossing was created (Danube bridge Wörth). In 1981, 20 km were added to Straubing, the gap closure to Deggendorf was opened in 1984. Thus, the highway was completely completed and passable.\n\n1992 was a general reorganization of the motorway network in Germany. As a result, the signage had to be revised, the number of goals on the signposts was reduced, which was partly accompanied by a considerable loss of information. At the same time, a numbering of all junctions, triangles and crosses in the German motorway network was carried out.\n\nAs part of this reorganization arose by linking the former A 2 section from the Dutch border at Straelen to Duisburg with the former A 430 Duisburg-Kaiserberg-Dortmund the A 40. The double designation \"A 2 / A 3\" for the hitherto common Motorway section from the cross Duisburg-Kaiserberg to the cross Oberhausen could thus be reduced to A 3. At the same time, the junctions of this along the city limits Duisburg / Oberhausen running part of the motorway were renamed. The junction Duisburg-Meiderich received the new name \"Oberhausen-Lirich\", the cross Duisburg / Oberhausen, which is located entirely on Duisburg city, the new name \"Cross Oberhausen-West\" and the junction Duisburg-Hamborn the new name \"Oberhausen- Holten \". The name for the cross Duisburg-Kaiserberg has been corrected in \"Kreuz Kaiserberg\". The reference to the destination Duisburg along the A 3 from the cross Hilden in the north was deleted. Since then, there is such a hint only on the cross Breitscheid.\n\nThe two connection points on Leverkusen city area were renamed in 2009. Thus, the AS 22 (Leverkusen-Opladen) was formerly called only \"Opladen\" and the AS 24 (Leverkusen-Zentrum) only \"Leverkusen\". The basis for this was a decree of the North Rhine-Westphalian Ministry of Transport (so-called \"large city regulation\"), which states that in connection with cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, the city name must be prioritized.\n\nThe A 3 runs parallel to the Bundesstraße 8, which it thus replaced as a main highway. Both follow the medieval trade route \"Via Publica\" that was first mentioned in a document from 839.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2008, the section between the junctions Aschaffenburg and Aschaffenburg-Ost was expanded to six lanes. A fatal accident occurred on October 23, 2006, when a World War II aerial bomb exploded while milling a cement-lime mixture in the new hard shoulder. A construction worker was killed, the milling machine was completely destroyed and several vehicles and buildings were damaged. During a subsequent unearned dupe search in the peripheral areas and at greater depths, even more duds were found.\n\nIn a highway renewal work in the summer of 2014, a 500 kg heavy bomb from the Second World War was found on 19 August between the Offenbacher Kreuz and the junction Obertshausen. For defusing the A 3 between the Offenbacher cross and the junction Obertshausen was closed in both directions. Since it was not possible to remove the detonator of the British dud, the bomb had to be blown up on site. The result was a crater with dimensions of about 10 × 5 meters and a depth of about 3 meters. Furthermore, the road superstructure of the first lane and the stationary strip of the directional road raised up to about half a meter. The road to Würzburg was closed until 21 August.\n\nThe A3 is four-laning for the first 65 kilometers (41 mi) up from the Dutch border. There are six lanes, three lanes in each direction, between interchange \"Kreuz Oberhausen\" and \"Köln-Mülheim\". On a short part inside of \"Kreuz Kaiserberg\" the A3 has two lanes. The Autobahn is equipped with eight lanes on the Cologne Beltway between \"Köln-Mülheim\" and autobahn triangle \"Dreieck Köln-Heumar\".\n\nThe course until Waldaschaff near Aschaffenburg has six lanes. The A3 is seven-laning between \"Mönchhof-Dreieck\" and \"Wiesbadener Kreuz\" (four lanes in the direction of Cologne, three to Würzburg) and eight-laning between \"Frankfurter Kreuz\" and \"Offenbacher Kreuz\".\n\nThe A3 has only four lanes from \"Aschaffenburg-Ost\" to the junction with the A 73 \"Kreuz Fürth/Erlangen\" in 2009. The \"Spessart\"-slope near Waldaschaff and some slope areas near Würzburg have additional lanes. There are plans to expand this area of the A3 up to six lanes in the next few years. The construction between \"Hösbach\" and \"Bessenbach/Waldaschaff\" was finished in 2011, and the new building of the \"Haseltalbrücke\" was terminated in 2012. The section in the area of Würzburg — from the border between Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria near \"Helmstadt\" to \"Würzburg-Heidingsfeld\" and from \"Würzburg\" to \"Rottendorf\" — was expanded until 2012. The next kilometers between \"Rottendorf\" and interchange \"Kreuz Biebelried\" was in late 2012. The expansion of the last section near Würzburg, between \"Würzburg-Heidingsfeld\" and \"Würzburg/Rottendorf\" started in 2013.\n\nThere are six lanes between \"Kreuz Fürth/Erlangen\" and \"Kreuz Nürnberg\" while the remaining section towards the Austrian border only has two lanes in each direction.\n\nBetween Cologne and Frankfurt an ICE high-speed railway line (300 km/h) closely follows the A 3's route.\n\nTwo sections in the Frankfurt area are equipped with a special kind of facility to allow a temporary release of the emergency lanes during the rush hour. The section between \"Hanau\" and \"Offenbacher Kreuz\" and also the section between \"Kelsterbach\" and \"Mönchhof-Dreieck\" have this facility, so that a further lane for each direction can be opened. These sections are monitored by cameras, so that the additional lane can be closed in critical situations, for example in case of a vehicle breakdown.\n\nSome parts of the A3 are among the most busy roads in Germany. According to a survey from 2010, three sections are in the Top 10 of roads with major average traffic each day. Only the Berlin city autobahn A100 had more traffic in 2010.\n\n\nThe eastern Cologne ring road is to be expanded eight miles between the cross Leverkusen and the triangle Cologne-Heumar on about fourteen kilometers in length. The route between Dreieck Heumar and Kreuz Köln-Ost was expanded between 2003 and 2005. The following section to the Cologne-Dellbrück junction was completed in 2008 and then to the junction Köln-Mülheim in 2012. [27] However, the central building in the interchange Leverkusen is reinforced as it is no longer able to cope with the burdens.\n\nThe further expansion up to the cross Leverkusen is in the federal traffic route plan (BVWP) with the status urgent need. From the investment framework plan for the years 2011 to 2015 of the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development, the view was expressed that for the reconstruction of the AK Leverkusen and the expansion between the interchanges Leverkusen Center and Cologne-Mülheim, the planning should be promoted priority to start construction by 2015. The planning approval decision for the eight-lane expansion in the section from Cologne-Mülheim to AS Leverkusen-Zentrum was available at the end of January 2012. The eight-lane expansion between AS Köln-Mülheim and AS Leverkusen has been open to traffic since June 2, 2017. The expansion between AK Leverkusen and AS Leverkusen-Zentrum is considered to be another important project with a realization after 2015. This further expansion of the A3 is also in direct functional connection with the expansion / conversion of the A1 between the Rhine bridge Leverkusen and the interchange Leverkusen and should therefore probably be realized together.\n\nIn the BVWP 2030 was also classified an eight-lane expansion of the sections between Heumar and Königsforst, as well as between the crosses Leverkusen and Oberhausen in the Priority Needs, as well as a conversion of the motorway junctions Oberhausen, Kaiserberg and Hilden. The north adjacent four-lane section to Dinslaken North is also urgently to be expanded to six lanes.\n\nIn the course of the new construction of the Lahntalbrücke Limburg, the highway route between km 107 and 110 was moved slightly to the east and expanded from six (without side stripes) to eight (plus side stripes) strips with additional noise barriers. This section between the junctions Limburg-Nord and Limburg-Süd takes up a lot of inner-city traffic. The official ground-breaking ceremony took place in June 2013 and the completion of the work in 2017. An eight-lane extension of the subsequent section to the Wiesbadener Kreuz received in the BVWP 2030 a classification in the Further Needs.\n\nIn the urgent need, it is an expansion of the Wiesbaden and Offenbacher cross planned. Between the Wiesbadener Kreuz and the Frankfurter Kreuz, as well as from Offenbach to Hanau, an eight-lane extension is planned in priority need. For the section between Mönchhof-triangle and the interchange airport (in the western part of the Frankfurter Kreuz) began in the spring of 2009, the planning approval process. The eight-lane section between Frankfurter Kreuz and Offenbacher Kreuz is to be extended to ten lanes. This expansion was classified as Further Demand with Planning Law.\n\nWith the status urgent need is provided in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2003, the highway from Aschaffenburg on the Spessart and Main Franconia to the intersection Biebelried six-lane expand. All sections not yet realized have been included in the investment framework plan for the years 2011 to 2015 of the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development as priority measures.\n\nThe 19 km long western subsection from the junction Aschaffenburg up to and including Kauppenbrücke was expanded in the years 2001 to 2011 on six lanes. The Autobahndirektion Nordbayern indicated in 2016 that construction costs amounting to 580 million euros. From height Keilberg the route was moved with the Kauppenbrücke for reasons of noise protection from Waldaschaff away to the south.\n\nThe 30 km long middle subsection, for which the Autobahndirektion Nordbayern in 2016 stated construction costs of 287 million euros, lies between the Kauppenbrücke and the Mainbrücke Bettingen. The 7.7 km long route to the junction Rohrbrunn was expanded since April 2013 and released on 17 November 2015 for traffic. In the direction of Würzburg, an additional fourth lane was built on the slope of the Spessart climb. The approximately five-kilometer-long route between the Rohrbrunn junction and the Haseltalbrücke (including the expansion of the Spessart Süd refueling facility) has been under construction since 2016. The construction period should be around four years and be completed in 2018. Here, the connection point is moved out of the T + R Spessart. Between 2007 and May 2012, the replacement new construction of the Haseltal bridge was erected and, in addition, two 1.2 km-long sections of the adjacent planning sections were extended on both sides of the bridge. For the following approximately -kilometer-long section to the west of Marktheidenfeld, the plan approval decision has been available since July 2008. The expansion started in 2016 and will take four years, to be completed by 2020. The plan approval decision has been in place since October 2008 for the section to the Main; the expansion began in 2014 and was expected to be completed in 2017. The adjoining Mainbrücke Bettingen was previously completed in 2001 after three and a half years of construction. The bridge is passable, but until the 6-lane completion of the adjacent sections, provisionally only four lanes are open.\n\nThe eastern subsection, for which the Autobahndirektion Nordbayern 2016 construction costs of 574 million euros stated, lies between the Main Bridge Bettingen and the intersection Biebelried. It consisted of seven planned parts. The first included a 6.5 km section of track, which began east of the Main Bridge Bettingen and was in Baden-Württemberg. Construction work began in 2014 after the planning approval decision in 2007 and was completed by the end of 2017. A two kilometers after the border beginning eleven-kilometer section to the interchange Würzburg-West was extended between June 2009 and December 2011. The expansion of the 8.0 km-long section to the junction Würzburg-Heidingsfeld took place from mid-2007 to December 2009. In the direction of travel in Frankfurt, there is a 2.0 km-long lane in the incline area.\n\nThe most elaborate section lies between the junctions Würzburg-Heidingsfeld and Würzburg / Randersacker and is 5.4 km long. In May 2008, after contradictions by the city of Würzburg, a new plan approval procedure was initiated, which was concluded with the plan approval decision of 17 December 2009. Afterwards, the valley bridge Heidingsfeld should be lowered and the district Heuchelhof underpassed with the Katzenberg tunnel. It is expected to have a construction time of about five and a half years. An action was brought against the decision, which the Federal Administrative Court dismissed by judgment of 3 March 2011. The preparatory work began in September 2012, the construction work in July 2014. By December 2017, the first phase of construction, consisting of the northern directional lane, the future direction Frankfurt, to be completed. Afterwards, the existing bridge will be demolished and the 2nd construction phase started. Completion with the release of both lanes is planned for the end of 2019.\n\nThe subsequent 2.0 km section with the construction of the Randersacker Main Bridge and the extension of the Randersacker junction was started in 2007 and completed in July 2011. The six-lane traffic release took place together with the eastern adjacent section. In Fahrtrichtung Würzburg wurde im Steigungsbereich des Spessartaufstiegs ein zusätzlicher vierter Fahrstreifen errichtet. The last part of the track construction is long and ends at the intersection Biebelried. From June 2007 to December 2009, the early, partial conversion of the junction Rottendorf was carried out. The start of construction for the actual expansion was in the fall of 2009.\n\nThe first section to the junction Rottendorf has been expanded since March 2012. Since then, four lanes have been usable here in the gradient area on the Nuremberg directional road. The construction work for the second section of the junction Rottendorf to the intersection Biebelried were completed on 12 October 2012.\n\nThe six-lane expansion of the route between the Biebelried interchange and the Fürth / Erlangen intersection is classified as an ongoing project in the new BVWP 2030 and is to be implemented via a public-private partnership. Planning took place during the lifetime of the FTIP 2003, with the section west of the AS key field classified as Priority Demand, and east of the AS key field in Additional Demand with planning rights. The route is divided into eleven planning sections:\n\nIt is planned to connect the Nuremberg Airport to the motorway with the B 4f (\"Nordspange\"). This creates a new connection point on the A 3.\n\nEast of Neumarkt in the Upper Palatinate in December 2012, the new junction \"Neumarkt East\" was opened to traffic. This now bears the number \"92b\".\n\nHowever, in March 2008 the Federal Ministry of Transport approved an early start of planning. The plan approval procedure was initiated on 25 August 2014. Now it is considered to expand the 120 kilometers between Regensburg and Passau completely six-lane. The cost of this is estimated at 1.2 billion euros. In the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030, the sections between Nittendorf and Rosenhof as well as between Deggendorf and Hengersberg were finally classified as Priority Needs, the section between Hengersberg and Aicha vorm Wald into further demand with planning rights. For the remaining sections, there is currently no extension due to a low cost-benefit ratio.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018, the carriageway in the Regensburg-Straubing section will be rehabilitated.\n\nSince October 2017, the six-lane expansion is being driven forward between the Regensburg junction and the Rosenhof junction.\n"}
{"id": "2318386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318386", "title": "Lorraine O'Grady", "text": "Lorraine O'Grady\n\nLorraine O'Grady (born September 21, 1934 in Boston) is an American artist and critic. She works in conceptual art and performance art that integrates photo and video installation. Her work explores the cultural construction of identity - particularly that of black female subjectivity - as shaped by the experience of diaspora and hybridity.\n\nBorn in Boston, Massachusetts to Jamaican parents, O'Grady studied at Wellesley College and the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop before becoming an artist.\n\nRegarding the purpose of art, O'Grady said in 2016: \"I think art’s first goal is to remind us that we are human, whatever \"that\" is. I suppose the politics in my art could be to remind us that we are \"all\" human.\"\n\nO'Grady was born in Boston to Jamaican parents, who helped establish St. Cyprian's, the first West Indian Episcopal church in Boston. Drawn to the form and aesthetics of the \"high church\" of nearby St. John's of Roxbury Crossing, O'Grady recalls: \"I was permanently formed by the aesthetics of that experience, of the rituals, which are a more stately and elegant version of Roman Catholicism. I did \"believe\" until my mid-twenties, until my sister [Devonia] died, then I stopped believing.\" In 1955, O'Grady graduated from Wellesley College, where she majored in economics and minored in Spanish literature. She was honored with a Wellesley College Alumnae Achievement Award in 2017. O'Grady pursued a master's degree in fiction from the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop before becoming an artist in 1980. Prior to becoming an artist O'Grady worked in many other professions, from a translator, a critic and an intelligence analyst for the American Government.\n\nIn the 1980s, she created the persona of Mlle Bourgeoise Noire, who invaded art openings wearing a gown and a cape made of 180 pairs of white gloves, first giving away flowers, then beating herself with a white studded whip, which she often referred to as, \"the whip-that-made-the-plantations-move\". Whilst doing this she would often shout in protest poems that railed against a segregated art world that excluded black individuals from the world of mainstream art, and which she perceived as not looking beyond a small circle of friends. Her first performance as Mlle Bourgeoise Noire was in 1980 at the Linda Goode Bryant's Just Above Midtown gallery in Tribeca. \n\nIn 1983, she choreographed a final participatory performance as Mlle Bourgeoise Noire called \"Art Is...\", which consisted of a parade float she entered in the annual African American Day Parade in Harlem. The float was shepherded up Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard by \"O’Grady [in character as Mlle Bourgeoise Noire] and a troupe of 15 African-American and Latino performers, dressed all in white, [who] walked around the float carrying empty gold picture frames.\" The performance not only encouraged onlookers - primarily people of color - to consider themselves art, but also drew attention to racism in the artworld. Printed for the first time more than three decades later, O’Grady’s photographs from the performance continue its legacy by interrogating issues of representation, celebrating Blackness, and claiming avant-garde art as a Black medium. From 2015-2016, \"Art Is...\" was featured at the Studio Museum in Harlem, where Assistant Curator Amanda Hunt asserted that O’Grady’s performance “affirmed the readiness of Harlem’s residents to see themselves as works of art.” In January of 2020, four of O'Grady's \"Art Is...\" photographs were featured in Artpace’s exhibit titled\"Visibilities: Intrepid Women of Artpace\". As a past summer 2007 International Artist-in-Residence at Artpace, O'Grady's series was included in a show celebrating female-identifying artists.\n\nO'Grady also gives credit to Mlle Bourgeoise Noire for curating exhibitions, such as \"The Black and White Show\" in 1983 at Kenkeleba House, a black-run gallery situated in Manhattan's East Village. The concept for this event was to show the work of 30 black artists alongside 30 white artists. Beginning in 1991 she added photo installations to her conceptually based work. And in 2007, she made her first video installation during a residency at Artpace in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nHer strongly feminist work has been widely exhibited, particularly in New York City and Europe. O'Grady's early \"Mlle Bourgeoise Noire\" performance was given new recognition when it was made an entry-point to the landmark exhibit \"WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution\", the first mainstream museum show of this groundbreaking art movement. Her practice, seemingly located at and defining the cusp between modernism and a \"not-quite-post-modernist\" present, has been the subject of steadily increasing interest since it received a two-article cover feature in the May 2009 issue of \"Artforum\" magazine. In December 2009, it was given a one-person exhibit in the U.S.'s most important contemporary art fair, Art Basel Miami Beach. Subsequently, O'Grady was one of 55 artists selected for inclusion in the 2010 Whitney Biennial. Her work has since featured in many seminal exhibitions, including: \"This Will Have Been: Art, Love & Politics in the 1980s\"; \"Radical Presence: Black Performance in Contemporary Art\", and \"En Mas': Carnival and Performance Art of the Caribbean\".\n\nO'Grady first exhibited at the age of 45, after successful careers among others as a government intelligence analyst, literary and commercial translator, and rock critic. In addition to the articles she has written for \"Artforum\" magazine and \"Art Lies\", her essay, \"Olympia's Maid: Reclaiming Black Female Subjectivity,\" has now been anthologized numerous times, most recently in Amelia Jones (ed.), \"The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader\" (2nd edition, Routledge, 2010).\n\nShe was featured in \"We Wanted a Revolution: Black Radical Women 1965-85\", an exhibition organized by Catherine Morris, Sackler Family Senior Curator for the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, and Rujeko Hockley, former Assistant Curator of Contemporary Art, Brooklyn Museum. The exhibit was shown at the Brooklyn Museum April 21–September 17, 2017 and at the California African American Museum October 13, 2017 - January 14, 2018 and will be at The Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston June 27 – September 30, 2018. It explores Black feminist art where the ideas come first, and then through multiple mediums including, video, sculpture, performance, photography and painting she decided which will portray her expression best. The work of each artist is placed in the historical context of cultural movements during 1965-85.\n\nO'Grady lives and works in the Meatpacking District of New York City.\n\n\"Olympia's Maid: Reclaiming Black Female Subjectivity\" is an essay originally published in 1992 in the book, New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action. The first part of the essay was published in Afterimage 20 (Summer 1992). Widely referenced in scholarly works, it is a cultural critique of the representation of Black female bodies, and the reclamation of the body as a site of black female subjectivity. O'Grady has made the essay available on her website.\n\nO’Grady opens the essay stating that the female body in the West is not a unitary sign. She uses the metaphor of the coin- that which has two sides but cannot be separated- to distinguish the separate bodies of the West’s metaphorical construction of the woman: white and non-white. This separation designates woman as white and omits the non-white figure from the discourse dealing with sexual difference. This construction of the West’s ‘woman’ places whiteness as fundamental and Blackness as the 'other', the entity that is parallel in the defining of the self. O’Grady uses the Victorian painting Olympia by Édouard Manet as an example of the Eurocentric depiction of Black womanhood. The painting features a nude prostitute, modeled by Victorine Meurent with her black maidservant, modeled by Laure, in the background. \"The image of the black female constructed in this period reflected everything the white female was not.\" The West, she writes, has constructed the not-white woman as unseen.\n\nThe metaphors of both the prostitute and feminist psychoanalysis’ the female eunuch as a way of describing Olympia’s maid’s positionality as a Black woman are used by O'Grady. The white body of Olympia is the only object of male gaze, and Laure’s inclusion is subconsciously critiqued through the reading of the white figure. In a damaging critique of the painting from when it was originally shown, Amedee Cantaloube describes as \"a kind of female gorilla, a grotesque rubber figure surrounded by black, a monkey on a bed, completely nude.\"\n\n\"O'Grady specifically refers to a tradition of iconography of black female sexuality that casts black women as simplistic stereotypes, such as the \"Hottentot Venus,\" \"Jezebel,\" \"mammy,\" \"Sapphire,\" \"welfare queen,\" and more recently \"quota queen\" and \"baby mama.' \" Quoting Patricia Hill Collins, Janelle Hobson states that these stereotypes are products of the systems of power, meant to control those without white skin privilege and \"distort the way black women see themselves and each other\" They also create the process of unmirroring. Where mirroring in terms of psychology refers to the imitating of one by another, unmirroring refers to the process in which a subjected figure imitates the distorted image of themselves, projected by the authority of the status quo.\n\nO’Grady references African-American artist Adrian Piper’s art practice, specifically her performance, \"Food for the Spirit\" (1971), as an example of the proper representation of the subjective Black nude, though this is problematic because as of September 2012, Piper has \"retired from being black.\"\n\nConceptual artist Renée Greene’s work \"Seen\" (1990) is also mentioned as representation based on Black female subjectivity, except according to O’Grady, the work falls short \"because it is addressed more to the other than to the self\" O’Grady discusses the struggle in depicting race, identity and proper representation as a Black female artist, drawing examples from her own artwork: the politics of skin color, hair texture and facial features. In privileging a facial feature that looks a particular way over another or in pairing light and dark skin tones, hierarchies of difference are created. These hierarchies of difference exist because of historical ideologies and they have difficulty breaking down because they are supported by the preconceived importance of the whiteness in the West. O’Grady states:\"to win back that position for the African-American female will require balancing in mental solution a subversion of two objects which may appear specifically distinct: on one hand, phallocentric theory; and on the other, the lived realities of Western imperialist history\" It comes from the understanding of the structures put in place by these two theories and an overall restructuring of these theories for progress to be made. Social change cannot happen, she writes, without the reorientation of the systems that exist to subjugate Black people.\n\nO’Grady picks out psychoanalysis as the \"linchpin of Western (male) [sic] cultural theory.\" She quotes Jacqueline Rose’s description of psychoanalysis and race: \"To say that psychoanalysis does not, or cannot, refer to non-European cultures, is to constitute those cultures in total ‘otherness’ or ‘difference’; to say, or to try to demonstrate, that it can, is to constitute them as the ‘same.’ \"\n\n\"The creation of a black feminist aesthetic must challenge dominant culture's discourse of the black body [as] grotesque and articulate a black liberation discourse on the black body [as] beautiful.\" European and European-American society has historically viewed Blackness as ugly. It is up to those working within Black feminist theory and critique to reinvent a new positionality. This, O’Grady argues, comes at a time when subjectivity itself has been problematized by ideology. Ideology is a patriarchal practice and theory is what substantiates it; theories of the political and social as well as the ideological/intellectual aided in the creation of the devalued Black figure. Out of ideology, she writes, came the notion of binary logic: either/or-ism.\n\nAs a standard, the Western mode of thinking, as proposed by many feminists, is ‘either:or-ism.’ It describes two modes of thought or plans of action that can be reached, but never can the two be reached together. \"The binary logic of the west takes on an added dimension when confronted with the presence of a black woman.\" Behind the binary logic of science in the nineteenth century, literature and art situates the representations of Black woman at both the site and sight of violation. Either/or logic fragments that which it is applied to. Riffing off of this logical ideology, O’Grady makes mention of a contrasting Eastern mode of thinking: ‘both/and’ logic. It describes dialogical thinking and living, implying the functioning of both options within a scenario and suggests the abandonment of the either/or hierarchy.\n\nIn 1995–96, O'Grady held the Bunting Fellowship in Visual Art at Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study. There she became immersed in the internet during its early years.\n\nSince 1997, she has been a Senior Fellow of the Vera List Center for Art and Politics, New School University. In 2009 she received the \"Anonymous Was A Woman\" award, a United States Artists Rockefeller Fellowship in Visual Art in 2011, the College Art Association's Distinguished Feminist Award in 2014, and a Creative Capital Award in Visual Art in 2015.\n\nIn October 2017 she received the Alumnae Achievement Award, the highest honor given to Wellesley College alumnae.\n\nO'Grady's work is the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago, Illinois; the Brooklyn Museum, New York; the Davis Museum and Cultural Center, Wellesley, Massachusetts; the Fogg Museum at Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, California; the Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts; the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and the Worcester Art Museum, Massachusetts.\n\nA review by O'Grady of the night Bob Marley and the Wailers opened for Bruce Springsteen at Max's Upstairs in Manhattan, July 18, 1973, was rejected at the time by her \"Village Voice\" editor, who said \"It's too soon for them.\" The review was first published nearly 40 years later in \"Max's Kansas City: Art, Glamour, Rock and Roll,\" 2010, a photo book with texts by Lou Reed, Lenny Kaye, Danny Fields, Lorraine O’Grady, and Steven Watson.\n\nO'Grady's name is one of those shouted in the hit song \"Hot Topic,\" by electroclash band Le Tigre.\n\nIn 2016 O’Grady was the subject of musician Anohni's video \"Marrow\" from the \"Hopelessness\" album.\n\n"}

{"id": "2318393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318393", "title": "SNARE (protein)", "text": "SNARE (protein)\n\nSNARE proteins — \"SNAP REceptor\" — are a large protein family consisting of at least 24 members in yeasts and more than 60 members in mammalian cells. The primary role of SNARE proteins is to mediate vesicle fusion – the fusion of vesicles with the target membrane; this notably mediates exocytosis, but can also mediate the fusion of vesicles with membrane-bound compartments (such as a lysosome). The best studied SNAREs are those that mediate the neurotransmitter release of synaptic vesicles in neurons. These neuronal SNAREs are the targets of the neurotoxins responsible for botulism and tetanus produced by certain bacteria.\n\nSNAREs can be divided into two categories: \"vesicle\" or \"v-SNAREs\", which are incorporated into the membranes of transport vesicles during budding, and \"target\" or \"t-SNAREs\", which are associated with nerve terminal membranes. Evidence suggests that t-SNAREs form stable subcomplexes which serve as guides for v-SNARE, incorporated into the membrane of a protein-coated vesicle, binding to complete the formation of the SNARE complex. Several SNARE proteins are located on both vesicles and target membranes, therefore, a more recent classification scheme takes into account structural features of SNAREs, dividing them into R-SNAREs and Q-SNAREs. Often, R-SNAREs act as v-SNAREs and Q-SNAREs act as t-SNAREs. R-SNAREs are proteins that contribute an arginine (R) residue in the formation of the zero ionic layer in the assembled core SNARE complex. One particular R-SNARE is synaptobrevin, which is located in the synaptic vesicles. Q-SNAREs are proteins that contribute a glutamine (Q) residue in the formation of the zero ionic layer in the assembled core SNARE complex. Q-SNAREs include syntaxin and SNAP-25. Q-SNAREs are further classified as Qa, Qb, or Qc depending on their location in the four-helix bundle.\n\nSNAREs are small, abundant, sometimes tail-anchored proteins which are often post-translationally inserted into membranes via a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Seven of the 38 known SNAREs, including SNAP-25, do not have a transmembrane domain and are instead attached to the membrane via lipid modifications such as palmitoylation. Tail-anchored proteins can be inserted into the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and peroxisomes among other membranes, though any particular SNARE is targeted to a unique membrane. The targeting of SNAREs is accomplished by altering either the composition of the C-terminal flanking amino acid residues or the length of the transmembrane domain. Replacement of the transmembrane domain with lipid anchors leads to an intermediate stage of membrane fusion where only the two contacting leaflets fuse and not the two distal leaflets of the two membrane bilayer.\n\nAlthough SNAREs vary considerably in structure and size, they all share a segment in their cytosolic domain called a SNARE motif that consists of 60-70 amino acids and contains heptad repeats that have the ability to form coiled-coil structures. V- and t-SNAREs are capable of reversible assembly into tight, four-helix bundles called \"trans\"-SNARE complexes. In synaptic vesicles, the readily-formed metastable \"trans\" complexes are composed of three SNAREs: syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 resident in cell membrane and synaptobrevin (also referred to as vesicle-associated membrane protein or VAMP) anchored in the vesicle membrane.\n\nIn neuronal exocytosis, syntaxin and synaptobrevin are anchored in respective membranes by their C-terminal domains, whereas SNAP-25 is tethered to the plasma membrane via several cysteine-linked palmitoyl chains. The core \"trans\"-SNARE complex is a four-formula_1-helix bundle, where one formula_1-helix is contributed by syntaxin 1, one formula_1-helix by synaptobrevin and two formula_1-helices are contributed by SNAP-25.\n\nThe plasma membrane-resident SNAREs have been shown to be present in distinct microdomains or clusters, the integrity of which is essential for the exocytotic competence of the cell.\n\nDuring membrane fusion, v-SNARE and t-SNARE proteins on separate membranes combine to form a trans-SNARE complex, also known as a \"SNAREpin\". Depending on the stage of fusion of the membranes, these complexes may be referred to differently.\n\nDuring fusion of \"trans\"-SNARE complexes, the membranes merge and SNARE proteins involved in complex formation after fusion are then referred to as a \"\"cis\"\"-SNARE complex, because they now reside in a single (or \"cis\") resultant membrane. After fusion, the \"cis\"-SNARE complex is bound and disassembled by an adaptor protein, alpha-SNAP. Then, the hexameric ATPase (of the AAA type) called NSF catalyzes the ATP-dependent unfolding of the SNARE proteins and releases them into the cytosol for recycling.\n\nSNAREs are thought to be the core required components of the fusion machinery and can function independently of additional cytosolic accessory proteins. This was demonstrated by engineering \"flipped\" SNAREs, where the SNARE domains face the extracellular space rather than the cytosol. When cells containing v-SNAREs contact cells containing t-SNAREs, \"trans\"-SNARE complexes form and cell-cell fusion ensues.\n\nThe core SNARE complex is a 4-formula_1-helix bundle. Synaptobrevin and syntaxin contribute one formula_1-helix each, while SNAP-25 participates with two formula_1-helices (abbreviated as Sn1 and Sn2). The interacting amino acid residues that zip the SNARE complex can be grouped into layers. Each layer has 4 amino acid residues - one residue per each of the 4 formula_1-helices. In the center of the complex is the \"zero ionic layer\" composed of one arginine (R) and three glutamine (Q) residues, and it is flanked by leucine zippering. Layers '-1', '+1' and '+2' at the centre of the complex most closely follow ideal leucine-zipper geometry and aminoacid composition.\n\nThe \"zero ionic layer\" is composed of R56 from VAMP-2, Q226 from syntaxin-1A, Q53 from Sn1 and Q174 from Sn2, and is completely buried within the leucine-zipper layers. The positively charged guanidino group of the arginine (R) residue interact with the carboxyl groups of each of the three glutamine (Q) residues.\n\nThe flanking leucine-zipper layers act as a water-tight seal to shield the ionic interactions from the surrounding solvent. Exposure of the \"zero ionic layer\" to the water solvent by breaking the flanking leucine zipper leads to instability of the SNARE complex and is the putative mechanism by which formula_1-SNAP and NSF recycle the SNARE complexes after the completion of synaptic vesicle exocytosis.\n\nSNARE proteins must assemble into \"trans\"-SNARE complexes to provide the force that is necessary for vesicle fusion. The four α-helix domains (1 each from synaptobrevin and syntaxin, and 2 from SNAP-25) come together to form a coiled-coil motif. The rate-limiting step in the assembly process is the association of the syntaxin SNARE domain, since it is usually found in a \"closed\" state where it is incapable of interacting with other SNARE proteins. When syntaxin is in an open state, \"trans\"-SNARE complex formation begins with the association of the four SNARE domains at their N-termini. The SNARE domains proceed in forming a coiled-coil motif in the direction of the C-termini of their respective domains.\nThe SM protein Munc18 is thought to play a role in assembly of the SNARE complex, although the exact mechanism by which it acts is still under debate. It is known that the clasp of Munc18 locks syntaxin in a closed conformation by binding to its α-helical SNARE domains, which inhibits syntaxin from entering SNARE complexes (thereby inhibiting fusion). The clasp is also capable, however, of binding the entire four-helix bundle of the \"trans\"-SNARE complex. One hypothesis suggests that, during SNARE-complex assembly, the Munc18 clasp releases closed syntaxin, remains associated with the N-terminal peptide of syntaxin (allowing association of the syntaxin SNARE domain with other SNARE proteins), and then reattaches to the newly formed four-helix SNARE complex. This possible mechanism of dissociation and subsequent re-association with the SNARE domains could be calcium-dependent. This supports the idea that Munc18 plays a key regulatory role in vesicle fusion; under normal conditions the SNARE complex will be prevented from forming by Munc18, but when triggered the Munc18 will actually assist in SNARE-complex assembly and thereby act as a fusion catalyst.\n\nMembrane fusion is an energetically demanding series of events, which requires translocation of proteins in the membrane and disruption of the lipid bilayer, followed by reformation of a highly curved membrane structure. The process of bringing together two membranes requires input energy to overcome the repulsive electrostatic forces between the membranes. The mechanism that regulates the movement of membrane associated proteins away from the membrane contact zone prior to fusion is unknown, but the local increase in membrane curvature is thought to contribute in the process. SNAREs generate energy through protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions which act as a driving force for membrane fusion.\n\nOne model hypothesizes that the force required to bring two membranes together during fusion comes from the conformational change in \"trans\"-SNARE complexes to form \"cis\"-SNARE complexes. The current hypothesis that describes this process is referred to as SNARE \"zippering.\"\n\nWhen the \"trans\"-SNARE complex is formed, the SNARE proteins are still found on opposing membranes. As the SNARE domains continue coiling in a spontaneous process, they form a much tighter, more stable four-helix bundle. During this \"zippering\" of the SNARE complex, a fraction of the released energy from binding is thought to be stored as molecular bending stress in the individual SNARE motifs. This mechanical stress is postulated to be stored in the semi-rigid linker regions between the transmembrane domains and the SNARE helical bundle. The energetically unfavorable bending is minimized when the complex moves peripherally to the site of membrane fusion. As a result, relief of the stress overcomes the repulsive forces between the vesicle and the cell membrane and presses the two membranes together.\n\nSeveral models to explain the subsequent step - the formation of stalk and fusion pore - have been proposed. However, the exact nature of these processes remains debated. In accordance with the \"zipper\" hypothesis, as the SNARE complex forms, the tightening helix bundle puts torsional force on the transmembrane (TM) domains domains of synaptobrevin and syntaxin. This causes the TM domains to tilt within the separate membranes as the proteins coil more tightly. The unstable configuration of the TM domains eventually causes the two membranes to fuse and the SNARE proteins come together within the same membrane, which is referred to as a \"\"cis\"\"-SNARE complex. As a result of the lipid rearrangement, a fusion pore opens and allows the chemical contents of the vesicle to leak into the outside environment.\n\nThe continuum explanation of stalk formation suggests that membrane fusion begins with an infinitesimal radius until it radially expands into a stalk-like structure. However, such a description fails to take into account the molecular dynamics of membrane lipids. Recent molecular simulations show that the close proximity of the membranes allows the lipids to splay, where a population of lipids insert their hydrophobic tails into the neighboring membrane - effectively keeping a \"foot\" in each membrane. The resolution of the splayed lipid state proceeds spontaneously to form the stalk structure. In this molecular view, the splayed-lipid intermediate state is the rate determining barrier rather than the formation of the stalk, which now becomes the free energy minimum. The energetic barrier for establishment of the splayed-lipid conformation is directly proportional to the intermembrane distance. The SNARE complexes and their pressing of the two membranes together, therefore, could provide the free energy required to overcome the barrier.\n\nThe energy input that is required for SNARE-mediated fusion to take place comes from SNARE-complex disassembly. The suspected energy source is N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), an ATPase that is involved with membrane fusion. NSF homohexamers, along with the NSF cofactor α-SNAP, bind and dissociate the SNARE complex by coupling the process with ATP hydrolysis. This process allows for reuptake of synaptobrevin for further use in vesicles, whereas the other SNARE proteins remain associated with the cell membrane.\n\nThe dissociated SNARE proteins have a higher energy state than the more stable \"cis\"-SNARE complex. It is believed that the energy that drives fusion is derived from the transition to a lower energy \"cis\"-SNARE complex. The ATP hydrolysis-coupled dissociation of SNARE complexes is an energy investment that can be compared to \"cocking the gun\" so that, once vesicle fusion is triggered, the process takes place spontaneously and at optimum velocity. A comparable process takes place in muscles, in which the myosin heads must first hydrolyze ATP in order to adapt the necessary conformation for interaction with actin and the subsequent power stroke to occur.\n\nThe Q-SNARE protein Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) is composed of two α-helical domains connected by a random coil linker. The random coil linker region is most notable for its four cysteine residues. The α-helical domains combine with those of both syntaxin and synaptobrevin (also known as vesicle associated membrane protein or VAMP) to form the 4-α-helix coiled-coil SNARE complex critical to efficient exocytosis.\n\nWhile syntaxin and synaptobrevin both contain transmembrane domains which allow for docking with target and vesicle membranes respectively, SNAP-25 relies on the palmitoylation of cysteine residues found in its random coil region for docking to the target membrane. Some studies have suggested that association with syntaxin via SNARE interactions precludes the need for such docking mechanisms. Syntaxin knockdown studies however, failed to show a decrease in membrane bound SNAP-25 suggesting alternate docking means exist. The covalent bonding of fatty acid chains to SNAP-25 via thioester linkages with one or more cysteine residues therefore, provides for regulation of docking and ultimately SNARE mediated exocytosis. This process is mediated by a specialized enzyme called DHHC palmitoyl transferase. The cysteine rich domain of SNAP-25 has also been shown to weakly associate with the plasma membrane possibly allowing it to be localized near the enzyme for subsequent palmitoylation. The reverse of this process is carried out by another enzyme called palmitoyl protein thioesterase (see figure).\n\nThe availability of SNAP-25 in the SNARE complex is also theorized to possibly be spatially regulated via localization of lipid microdomains in the target membrane. Palmitoylated cysteine residues could be localized to the desired target membrane region via a favorable lipid environment (possibly cholesterol rich) complementary to the fatty acid chains bonded to the cysteine residues of SNAP-25.\n\nAs an action potential reaches the axon terminal, depolarization events stimulate the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) allowing the rapid influx of calcium down its electrochemical gradient. Calcium goes on to stimulate exocytosis via binding with synaptotagmin 1. SNAP-25 however, has been shown to negatively regulate VGCC function in glutamatergic neuronal cells. SNAP-25 leads to a reduction of current density through VGCC's and therefore a decrease in the amount of calcium that is binding the synaptotagmin, causing a decrease in neuronal glutamatergic exocytosis. Conversely, underexpression of SNAP-25 allows for an increase in VGCC current density and increase in exocytosis.\nFurther investigation has suggested possible relationships between SNAP-25 over/underexpression and a variety of brain diseases. In attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or ADHD, polymorphisms at the SNAP-25 gene locus in humans have been linked to the disease suggesting a potential role in its manifestation. This is further suggested by heterogeneous SNAP-25 knockout studies performed on coloboma mutant mice, which led to phenotypic characteristics of ADHD. Studies have also shown a correlation of SNAP-25 over/underexpression and the onset of schizophrenia.\n\nSyntaxin consists of a transmembrane domain (TMD), alpha-helical SNARE domain, a short linker region, and the Habc domain which consists of three alpha-helical regions. The SNARE domain in syntaxin serves as a target site for docking of SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin in order to form the four helix bundle requisite to the SNARE complex and subsequent fusion. The Habc domain, however, serves as an autoinhibitory domain in syntaxin. It has been shown to fold over and associate with the SNARE domain of syntaxin inducing a \"closed\" state, creating a physical barrier to the formation of the SNARE motif. Conversely, the Habc domain can again disassociate with the SNARE domain leaving syntaxin free to associate with both SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin.\n\nThere is an immense diversity of syntaxin subtypes, with 15 varieties in the human genome. It has been suggested that syntaxin1B has a role in regulating number of synaptic vesicles ready for exocytosis in the axon terminal. This is also called the readily releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles. A knock out study in 2014 showed that the lack of syntaxin1B led to a significant decrease in RRP size.\n\nMany neurotoxins directly affect SNARE complexes. Such toxins as the botulinum and tetanus toxins work by targeting the SNARE components. These toxins prevent proper vesicle recycling and result in poor muscle control, spasms, paralysis, and even death.\n\nBotulinum Toxin (BoNT) is one of the most potent toxins to have ever been discovered. It is a proteolytic enzyme that cleaves SNARE proteins in neurons. Its protein structure is composed of two peptide subunits, a heavy chain (100kDas) and a light chain (50kDas), which are held together by a disulfide bond. The action of BoNT follows a 4-step mechanism including binding to the neuronal membrane, endocytosis, membrane translocation, and proteolysis of SNARE proteins.\n\nIn its mechanism of action, the heavy chain of BoNT is first used to find its neuronal targets and bind to the gangliosides and membrane proteins of presynaptic neurons. Next, the toxin is then endocytosed into the cell membrane. The heavy chain undergoes a conformational change important for translocating the light chain into the cytosol of the neuron. Finally, after the light chain of BoNT is brought into the cytosol of the targeted neuron, it is released from the heavy chain so that it can reach its active cleavage sites on the SNARE proteins. The light chain is released from the heavy chain by the reduction of the disulfide bond holding the two together. The reduction of this disulfide bond is mediated by the NADPH-thioredoxin reductase-thioredoxin system. The light chain of BoNT acts as a metalloprotease on SNARE proteins that is dependent on Zn(II) ions, cleaving them and eliminating their function in exocytosis.\n\nThere are 8 known isotypes of BoNT, BoNT/A - BoNT/H, each with different specific cleavage sites on SNARE proteins. SNAP25, a member of the SNARE protein family located in the membrane of cells, is cleaved by BoNT isotypes A, C, and E. The cleavage of SNAP-25 by these isotypes of BoNT greatly inhibits their function in forming the SNARE complex for fusion of vesicles to the synaptic membrane. BoNT/C also targets Syntaxin-1, another SNARE protein located in the synaptic membrane. It degenerates these Syntaxin proteins with a similar outcome as with SNAP-25. A third SNARE protein, Synaptobrevin (VAMP), is located on cell vesicles. VAMP2 is targeted and cleaved by BoNT isotypes B, D, and F in synaptic neurons. The targets of these various isotypes of BoNT as well as Tetanus Neurotoxin (TeNT) are shown in the figure to the right.\n\nIn each of these cases, Botulinum Neurotoxin causes functional damage to SNARE proteins, which has significant physiological and medical implications. By damaging SNARE proteins, the toxin prevents synaptic vesicles from fusing to the synaptic membrane and releasing their neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. With the inhibition of neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft, action potentials cannot be propagated to stimulate muscle cells. This result in paralysis of those infected and in serious cases, it can cause death. Although the effects of Botulinum Neurotoxin can be fatal, it has also been used as a therapeutic agent in medical and cosmetic treatments.\n\nTetanus toxin, or TeNT, is composed of a heavy chain (100KDa) and a light chain (50kDa) connected by a disulfide bond. The heavy chain is responsible for neurospecific binding of TeNT to the nerve terminal membrane, endocytosis of the toxin, and translocation of the light chain into the cytosol. The light chain has zinc-dependent endopeptidase or more specifically matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity through which cleaveage of synaptobrevin or VAMP is carried out.\n\nFor the light chain of TeNT to be activated one atom of zinc must be bound to every molecule of toxin. When zinc is bound reduction of the disulfide bond will be carried out primarily via the NADPH-thioredoxin reductase-thioredoxin redox system. Then the light chain is free to cleave the Gln76-Phe77 bond of synaptobrevin. Cleavage of synaptobrevin affects the stability of the SNARE core by restricting it from entering the low energy conformation which is the target for NSF binding. This cleavage of synaptobrevin is the final target of TeNT and even in low doses the neurotoxin will inhibit neurotransmitter exocytosis.\n\nNeurotransmitters are stored in readily releasable pools of vesicles confined within the presynaptic terminal. During neurosecretion/exocytosis, SNAREs play a crucial role in vesicle docking, priming, fusion, and synchronization of neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft.\n\nThe first step in synaptic vesicle fusion is tethering, where the vesicles are translocated from the reserve pool into physical contact with the membrane. At the membrane, Munc-18 is initially bound to syntaxin 1A in a closed structure. It is postulated that the dissociation of Munc-18 from the complex frees syntaxin 1A to bind with the v-SNARE proteins. The next step in release is the docking of vesicles, where the v- and t-SNARE proteins transiently associate in a calcium-independent manner. The vesicles are then primed, wherein the SNARE motifs form a stable interaction between the vesicle and membrane. Complexins stabilize the primed SNARE-complex rendering the vesicles ready for rapid exocytosis.\n\nThe span of presynaptic membrane containing the primed vesicles and dense collection of SNARE proteins is referred to as the active zone. Voltage-gated calcium channels are highly concentrated around active zones and open in response to membrane depolarization at the synapse. The influx of calcium is sensed by synaptotagmin 1, which in turn dislodges complexin protein and allows the vesicle to fuse with the presynaptic membrane to release neurotransmitter. It has also been shown that the voltage-gated calcium channels directly interact with the t-SNAREs syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25, as well as with synaptotagmin 1. The interactions are able to inhibit calcium channel activity as well as tightly aggregate the molecules around the release site.\n\nThere have been many clinical cases that link SNARE genes with neural disorders. Deficiency in SNAP-25 mRNA has been observed in hippocampal tissue of some schizophrenic patients, a SNAP-25 single-nucleotide polymorphism is linked to hyperactivity in autism-spectrum disorders, and overexpression of SNAP-25B leads to the early onset of bipolar disorder.\n\nMacroautophagy is a catabolic process involving the formation of double-membrane bound organelles called autophagosomes, which aid in degradation of cellular components through fusion with lysosomes. During autophagy, portions of the cytoplasm are engulfed by a cup-shaped double-membrane structure called a phagophore and eventually become the contents of the fully assembled autophagosome. Autophagosome biogenesis requires the initiation and growth of phagophores, a process that was once thought to occur through de novo addition of lipids. However, recent evidence suggests that the lipids that contribute to the growing phagophores originate from numerous sources of membrane, including endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, plasma membrane, and mitochondria. SNAREs play important roles in mediating vesicle fusion during phagophore initiation and expansion as well as autophagosome-lysosome fusion in the later stages of autophagy.\n\nThough the mechanism of phagophore initiation in mammals is unknown, SNAREs have been implicated in phagophore formation through homotypic fusion of small, clathrin-coated, single-membrane vesicles containing Atg16L, the v-SNARE VAMP7, and its partner t-SNAREs: Syntaxin-7, Syntaxin-8, and VTI1B. In yeast, the t-SNAREs Sec9p and Sso2p are required for exocytosis and promote tubulovesicular budding of Atg9 positive vesicles, which are also required for autophagosome biogenesis. Knocking out either of these SNAREs leads to accumulation of small Atg9 containing vesicles that do not fuse, therefore preventing the formation of the pre-autophagosomal structure.\n\nIn addition to phagophore assembly, SNAREs are also important in mediating autophagosome-lysosome fusion. In mammals, the SNAREs VAMP7, VAMP8, and VTI1B are required in autophagosome-lysosome fusion and this process is impaired in lysosomal storage disorders where cholesterol accumulates in the lysosome and sequesters SNAREs in cholesterol rich regions of the membrane preventing their recycling. Recently, syntaxin 17 (STX17) was identified as an autophagosome associated SNARE that interacts with VAMP8 and SNAP29 and is required for fusion with the lysosome. STX17 is localized on the outer membrane of autophagosomes, but not phagophores or other autophagosome precursors, which prevents them from prematurely fusing with the lysosome. In yeast, the fusion of autophagosomes with vacuoles (the yeast equivalent of lysosomes) requires SNAREs and related proteins such as the syntaxin homolog Vam3, SNAP-25 homolog Vam7, Ras-like GTPase Ypt7, and the NSF ortholog, Sec18.\n\n"}

They are perennial herbaceous plants with blue or sometimes white flowers that open from pink-tinged buds. Such a change in flower color is common in Boraginaceae and is caused by an increase of pH in the flower tissue. \"Mertensia\" is one of several plants that are commonly called \"bluebell\". In spite of their common name, the flowers are usually salverform (trumpet-shaped) rather than campanulate (bell-shaped).\n\n\"Mertensia\" is native to most of North America and to a large part of Asia from western China to northeastern Russia. Its center of diversity is in the Rocky Mountains. \"Mertensia\" is mostly restricted to alpine, subalpine, and montane habitats. Notable exceptions are \"Mertensia maritima\", a maritime plant of Arctic and subarctic coastlines, and \"Mertensia virginica\", which is found from the Appalachian Mountains west to Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri. Most of the species are endemic to very small areas of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n\"Mertensia virginica\" has the largest flowers in the genus and is commonly cultivated. It is sparingly naturalized in Europe. About 12 other species are known in cultivation. The Inuit ate the rhizomes of \"Mertensia maritima\".\n\nMany of the species of \"Mertensia\" are hard to distinguish and some are possibly cryptic. Around 150 species names have been published in \"Mertensia\". Most authors have recognized about 45 species, but in 2014, the authors of a molecular phylogenetic study recommended the acceptance of at least 62.\n\nAuthor citations are from Tropicos or the International Plant Names Index.\n\n\"Mertensia\" is a member of the tribe Cynoglosseae. Its closest relative is the monotypic Eurasian genus \"Asperugo\". These two are probably close to \"Anoplocaryum\", a genus of Central Asia and Siberia. The relationships of \"Anoplocaryum\" have never been investigated by cladistic analysis of DNA sequences.\n\nThe type species for \"Mertensia\" is \"M. virginica\". \"Mertensia\" is divided into two sections: Stenhammaria and Mertensia. Section Stenhammaria consists of the circumboreal \"M. maritima\" and 11 of the 12 species from Asia.\n\nThe Central Asian species, \"M. dschagastanica\", is assigned to section Stenhammaria, but it is morphologically unusual and might constitute a third section of \"Mertensia\". It has never been sampled for DNA.\n\nSection Mertensia consists of all of the North American species plus \"M. rivularis\", a denizen of the Russian half of the Beringian floristic region.\n\nThe North American species \"M. pilosa\" has been reported from Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. It is the only species of \"Mertensia\" that is native to both Asia and North America. It resembles \"M. rivularis\" and might be closer to that species than to the other species of North America. It also resembles \"M. platyphylla\" and some authors have placed it in synonymy under \"Mertensia platyphylla\" variety \"platyphylla\". It has not yet been sampled in a molecular phylogenetic study.\n\nWith the possible exception of \"M. pilosa\", North American \"Mertensia\" is a monophyletic group consisting of three clades that are known informally as the Pacific Northwest clade, the Southern Rocky Mountain clade, and the Central Rocky Mountain clade. These groups are named for the region where most of their species occur, but each includes species from well outside of that region.\n\nIn 1753, in his landmark \"Species Plantarum\", Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus placed five species in the genus \"Pulmonaria\". Albrecht Wilhelm Roth, in 1797, separated what are now \"M. virginica\", \"M. maritima\", and \"M. sibirica\" from \"Pulmonaria\" to form the genus \"Mertensia\", based on their smaller and differently structured calyx, their different anther position, and the presence of nectar glands on the inner surface of the corolla. Roth described one species as \"Mertensia pulmonarioides\", apparently unaware that Linnaeus had already described it as \"Pulmonaria virginica\". He thus created a superfluous synonym that has been a source of confusion ever since.\n\n\"Mertensia\" was named after the German botanist, Franz Carl Mertens.\n\nIn the time since \"Mertensia\" was erected in 1797, it has been the subject of six major revisions. These, in chronological order, were done by George Don (George Don, the younger (G. Don), not George Don, the elder (Don)), Asa Gray, James Francis Macbride, Per Axel Rydberg, Louis Otho Williams, and Mikhail Grigorevich Popov.\n\nAsa Gray divided \"Mertensia\" into two sections: Stenhammaria and Mertensia. The section Stenhammaria was named for the Swedish naturalist and clergyman Christian Stenhammar, who is best known for his work in lichenology. Gray defined the section Stenhammaria as consisting only of the littoral species \"M. maritima\", but in 2014, it was expanded to comprise 12 species.\n\nIn 1886, Asa Gray described seven species in \"Mertensia\". After Gray completed his monograph of \"Mertensia\", many species were discovered by botanical expeditions in the western United States. Many of the species recognized by Macbride and Rydberg were later placed in synonymy by Louis O. Williams in his treatment of North American \"Mertensia\" in which he accepted only 24 species, far fewer than Macbride and Rydberg. \"M. pilosa\" was not mentioned anywhere in the monograph by Williams, not even as a synonym. Popov (1953) recognized the same 24 North American species as Williams as well as 14 species from Asia, including \"M. pilosa\". Phylogenetic analysis of DNA data has shown that many of the species are polyphyletic, but no comprehensive revision of the Asian or of the North American species has been attempted since 1953.\n\nIn 1967, one of the sections delineated by Popov was raised to the rank of genus as \"Pseudomertensia\". This reclassification has been confirmed by molecular phylogenies which place \"Pseudomertensia\" closer to \"Myosotis\" than any of the genera that have been sampled so far.\n\nIn the earlier infrageneric classifications of \"Mertensia\", some of the groups were based on shared \"primitive\" characters rather than the derived character states that show true phylogenetic relationships. In \"Mertensia\", as elsewhere, such groups have often proved to be paraphyletic. More recently, molecular phylogenetics has greatly clarified the ancestral and derived character states in \"Mertensia\". Some of the traits evolving later have appeared independently as many as seven times.\n\nAncestral states in \"Mertensia\" include short plant height (< 40 cm), long stamens (> 1.5 mm), filaments inserted higher in the corolla, calyces divided at least ⁄ of the way to the base, and acute to acuminate calyx lobe apices. Their derived alternatives are greater plant height (> 40 cm), short stamens (< 1.5 mm), filaments attached lower in the corolla, and calyces divided less than halfway to the base, and obtuse calyx lobe apices.\n\nThe nutlets and pollen of \"Mertensia\" are nearly uniform and consequently, are not of much taxonomic value.\n\nThere are no known fossils of \"Mertensia\". A molecular clock analysis has estimated that \"Mertensia\" diverged from \"Asperugo\" in the late Oligocene or early Miocene. \"Asperugo\" and \"Mertensia\" do not closely resemble each other morphologically. Being mostly plants of subarctic climates, \"Mertensia\" spread southward and to lower elevation during periods of Pleistocene glaciation, then retreated northward and to higher elevation during interglacials. \"Mertensia\" originated in Asia and dispersed over the Beringian land bridge to North America. Most of the groups that originated in Asia are more diverse there, but \"Mertensia\" is a conspicuous exception in having most of its species in North America.\n\n"}
{"id": "2318404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318404", "title": "Arthropleuridea", "text": "Arthropleuridea\n\nArthropleuridea is an extinct subclass of myriapod arthropods that flourished during the Carboniferous period, having first arose during the Silurian, and perishing due to climate change just before the Early Permian. Members are characterized by possessing diplosegement (fused \"double segments\", as in modern-day millipedes) paranotal tergal lobes separated from the body axis by a suture, and by sclerotized plates buttressing the leg insertions. Despite their unique features, recent phylogenetic research suggests Arthropleuridea be included among millipedes in the class Diplopoda. The subclass contains three recognized orders, each with a single genus.\n\nArthropleurids lived in the moist coal swamps that were common at the time and may have burrowed in the undergrowth. They were either herbivores or detritivores. Besides their size, their most distinguishing features were their legs with eight segments (as many as 30 pairs) and extremely tough exoskeletons. There is no evidence of spiracles, so the animals must have used lungs or gills for respiration.\n\nMost arthropleurideans are thought to have been terrestrial, although, without any known respiratory structure, terrestriality is assumed only by analogy to modern arthropods. Early forms, however, including \"Eoarthropleura\" (order Eoarthropleurida), appear to have been aquatic. For this reason, some question Arthropleuridea's inclusion among millipedes because no modern aquatic myriapods are known.\n\nArthropleuridea is most famous for \"Arthropleura\" (order Arthropleurida). Tracks from \"Arthropleura\" up to 50 cm wide have been found at Joggins, Nova Scotia. Reaching over 2 meters in length, arthropleurids are among the largest arthropods ever to have lived. The lack of large terrestrial vertebrate predators and the highly oxygenic atmosphere at that time probably enabled them to grow so large. \"Arthropleura\" became extinct as the climate became drier and the coal swamps dried out. \"Arthropleura\" has been found from the Upper Carboniferous of Europe and North America.\n\n\"Eoarthropleura\" has been found from the Upper Silurian through the Upper Devonian of Europe and North America.\n\n\"Microdecemplex\", of the order Microdecemplicida, was smaller in comparison to the other arthropleurideans, at just a few millimeters long. The genus is known from the Middle through Upper Devonian of New York state, USA.\n\nAfter several decades of uncertainty, Arthropleuridea was placed within the Diplopoda in the year 2000. However, there is still controversy regarding the relationships of the three orders to living millipede groups. Some authors place Arthropleuridea within the Chilognatha, as a sister group to all living Chilognathan millipedes (Pentazonia + Helminthomorpha). An alternate hypothesis breaks up the subclass: placing the orders Arthropleurida and Eoarthropleurida within the basal Penicillata (as sister to the living Polyxenida), and leaving only Microdecemplicida as a sister group to the living Chilognatha. Under this hypothesis, Arthropleuridea would be paraphyletic.\n\n"}

He was a vocalist in the 1980s two-tone band the Beat (known in North America as the English Beat) and later General Public. Later, he headed up a reformed Beat lineup.\n\nThe \"Ranking\" moniker is short for \"top-ranking\" or \"high-ranking\", and is a boast typical of many MCs.\n\nRoger Charlery was born in Birmingham, England, and grew up in the Small Heath area of the city. The son of Jean Baptiste Charlery and his wife Anne Marie, he was of West Indian descent; his mother and father were from Saint Lucia. He attended Archbishop Williams school, and while still at school began deejaying with reggae sound systems before becoming a drummer with the Dum Dum Boys in 1978.\n\nRoger became a punk rock fan as a teenager and was the drummer in the Dum Dum Boys before joining ska revival pioneers the Beat in the late 1970s. The Dum Dum Boys' first gig was with the Beat and his burgeoning friendship with them meant he began to gatecrash their gigs, take the mic, and start toasting. He had appeared on stage, toasting and singing with them, many times before officially joining the band. His energetic style and Jamaican-influenced vocals, paired with Dave Wakeling, were crucial in distinguishing the band from the other second-wave ska bands. The Beat released three albums: the critically acclaimed and seminal \"I Just Can't Stop It\" (1980), \"Wha'ppen?\" (1981) and \"Special Beat Service\" (1982).\n\nMusic journalist Richard Grabel wrote in 1985: \"In the Beat, his role was mainly to 'toast' — Jamaican slang for the rhythmic raps that Roger would interject into the middle of the Beat's songs. But those toasts often contained the songs' most important emotional messages. Beyond that, Roger was the one whose looseness and humor, great dancing and general presence made the Beat happen on stage.\"\n\nIn 1981, Joe Strummer and Mick Jones of the Clash invited him to sing on a version of \"Rock the Casbah\" which was released in 2015. \n\nAfter the Beat's 1983 break-up, Roger and Wakeling formed General Public with former members of Dexys Midnight Runners and Horace Panter of the Specials. Roger took more of a leading role with vocals in this group. They released the album \"All the Rage\", aided by the single \"Tenderness\". Three years later, they released \"Hand to Mouth\", which was less successful, and the band split up. \n\nIn 1995, Roger and Wakeling reformed General Public with a new supporting band, and released the album \"Rub It Better\". The duo also worked on various projects and reunited for the 1994 \"Threesome\" soundtrack, recording a cover of \"I'll Take You There\".\n\nRoger released \"Radical Departure\", his first solo album, in 1988 which included band members Panter and Fuzz Townshend. The single \"So Excited\" reached #23 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. On 2001's \"Inside My Head\", Roger pursued a more dance/electronic sound.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Roger joined members of the Specials to form the new band Special Beat which released two live albums. In 1996, he sang back-up and toasting on the new version of \"The Bed's Too Big Without You\" on Sting's \"Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot\" CD-Maxi single. The rock band Smash Mouth featured Roger on their song \"You Are My Number One\" in 2003.\n\nHe collaborated with Pato Banton in 1995 on \"Bubbling Hot\", which reached number 15 on the UK single charts.\n\nIn 2005, the Beat re-formed, with Roger and Everett Morton of the original line-up, with Roger's son, Ranking Junior also on vocals. Performing some new material, the Beat performed at Glastonbury the same year, where Roger was joined by Ranking Junior.\n\nRoger sang on \"Roxanne\" on stage with the Police on their 2007 world tour. He was a guest performer on Big Audio Dynamite's seventh album \"Higher Power\" in 1994 when the band were known as simply 'Big Audio'. He later became a member of Big Audio Dynamite for their final studio album \"Entering a New Ride\" (1997).\n\nRoger contributed to \"Walls Come Tumbling Down: The Music and Politics of Rock Against Racism, 2 Tone and Red Wedge\", written by Daniel Rachel and published in 2016.\n\nRoger continued to lead the Beat and tours throughout Europe as well as works on solo projects. In his last years he released a series of new albums. 2013 saw the release of \"Retrospective\", an album of solo work recorded over the 25 years since the break-up of General Public, featuring various artists and producers including Sly and Robbie, and songs such as \"Bubbling Hot\" (the 1994 hit collaboration with Pato Banton) and a cover of \"The Bed's Too Big Without You\" (first recorded with Sting for the 1996 film \"The Truth About Cats & Dogs\").\n\n\"Live in London\" was released in 2013 – a live recording of the Beat playing at 229 The Venue, featuring some of their greatest hits as well as new tracks by Roger and Ranking Junior.\n\n2014’s \"Pop Off the Head Top\" consisted of entirely new compositions, including additional vocals and song writing from Ranking Junior. They recorded tracks for this project with Hugh Harris from London, Dopegrinders from Brighton and Mr. Anonymous from Colorado. Other key tracks involved the Italian producer AleXannA whose version of “16 Tons” features vocals by Roger, Ranking Junior, and Roger’s daughter Saffren Murphy.\n\n\"Rock the Casbah\", released in 2015 in collaboration with the charity Strummerville (founded by the friends and family of Joe Strummer to support aspiring musicians and projects that create social mobility through music) is a five-track EP which features a previously unheard version of \"Rock the Casbah\", which Joe Strummer and Mick Jones of the Clash had asked Roger to sing on back in 1981, re-recorded by the Brighton producers Dopegrinders, and using the original stems donated by Mick Jones. The EP features new tracks by Roger, Ranking Junior and Hugh Harris as well as a re-working of \"Muscle Ska\", co-written by Roger and Neville Staple from the Specials.\n\nIn September 2016, DMF released \"Bounce\"; the first new album by the Beat in 30 years. Written by Ranking Roger, Mick Lister and Ranking Junior, it was produced by Mick Lister and mixed by Tim Hamill and Mick Lister, with the exception of \"Side to Side\" and \"My Dream\", which were mixed by Dennis Bovell. The album was recorded in Roger's 'eco-friendly hideaway' – a round recording studio in his back garden, which he called The Pod. The album received generally positive reviews with reviewers typically praising the band's 'passionately political edge' and pointing to how the album 'encompasses every aspect of one of the most musically diverse bands to come out of the multi-racial, multi-cultural explosion that made British pop music what it was in the 80’s'.\n\nThe band continues to tour and currently features Roger’s son Ranking Junior (real name Matthew Murphy), with drummers Oscar Harrison of Ocean Colour Scene and Fuzz Townshend of Pop Will Eat Itself. The line-up is completed by Chiko Hamilton on sax, bass guitarist Andy Pearson, Ex. Bad Manners and Specialbeat guitarist Andy Perriss and Bobby Bird of Higher Intelligence Agency.\n\nIn 2017, the Beat joined fellow 2-tone band the Selecter for a co-headline UK tour, Owing to demand, the tour was extended to cover other countries.\n\nIn early August 2018, Ranking Roger was hospitalised with a suspected mini-stroke. He recuperated at home, but cancelled planned live shows in the United Kingdom and United States. The band had just finished recording an album and Roger had written his autobiography, \"I Just Can't Stop It\", published June 2019.\n\nRoger had five children, including son Ranking Junior (Matthew Murphy) and daughter Saffren who both featured with their father in a Beat revival band.\n\nIn January 2019, it was announced that Roger had undergone surgery for two brain tumours, and was undergoing treatment for lung cancer. He died at his home in Birmingham on 26 March 2019 at the age of 56.\n\n\n"}

It is also the name given to the waterway which flows through the town and into the sea at this point. Situated some 155 km west of Melbourne, on the Otway Coast part of the scenic Great Ocean Road, the Wye River township is a popular tourist destination about 15 km west of the resort town of Lorne, Victoria. It became a popular place for Melburnians to holiday after the Great Ocean Road was officially opened in 1932. The postcode of Wye River is 3234. At the , Wye River had a permanent population of 66 although its holiday population is ten times that number.\n\nThe site was occupied by white settlers in 1882. Brothers Alex and Donald MacRea and their cousin Alex MacLennan were looking for an area suited to farming and fishing and chose this site. The MacRaes settled near Separation Creek, establishing a farm which they named The Wye after a river in Wales and Herefordshire. Alex MacLennan settled a little further west at a site he named The Kennet (later the town of Kennett River) after another UK river.\n\nWye River Post Office opened on 19 January 1914 though before 1945 it was reduced to just a telegraph office for considerable periods of time, mail being delivered from Lorne. A school was established in the local hall in 1920, but closed in 1921 after the closure of a sawmill resulted in a loss of population. It was re-established in a converted residence in 1931, operated part-time with the Aireys Inlet school from 1935, and closed permanently in 1942.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2015 on the town's darkest day in history a bushfire destroyed at least 98 homes in Wye River. At nearby Separation Creek another 18 homes were destroyed. No lives were lost at either town.\n\nThe area is known for scenic coastal views, beautiful beaches, Otway Forest walks, wildlife including koalas and birds as well as the Great Otway National Park. Active tourism opportunities include fishing and excellent surfing.\n\nThe official tourism organisation representing Wye River is Otway Coast Tourism.\n\nThere are many self-contained holiday rental houses available. Wye River is an all season tourist destination where visitors enjoy beaches in summer and drives, food trails and water falls in winter. Tourists travelling with dogs are encouraged in many places.\n\nThere are two caravan parks, the Seasonal Foreshore, located close to the main beach, and the BIG4 Wye River Holiday Parkin the valley, which is privately owned and operates all year round.\n\nThere is one pub, the Wye Beach Hotel (formally known as \"The Rookery Nook Hotel\") and a general store Wye General which also contains the post office and a cafe.\n\nIn recent years, the numbers of southern right whales and humpback whales seen around the shores are increasing as the whale populations recover as well as other species such as bottlenose dolphins.\n\nWye River has a Country Fire Brigade and a Surf Life Saving Club.\nA cycling group called the Wye Riders ride bikes in the morning on the Great Ocean Road.

Covering , the forest is broken into nine separate sections and stretches across eight counties in the southwestern area of the state. President Theodore Roosevelt named the two forests in 1908 and they were merged in 1996. Forest headquarters are located in Dillon, Montana. In Roosevelt's original legislation, the Deerlodge National Forest was called the Big Hole Forest Reserve. He created this reserve because the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, based in Butte, Montana, had begun to clearcut the upper Big Hole River watershed. The subsequent erosion, exacerbated by smoke pollution from the Anaconda smelter, was devastating the region. Ranchers and conservationists alike complained to Roosevelt, who made several trips to the area.\n\nThe greatest part of the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness is located in the larger Beaverhead National Forest portion of , which is 64% of the total area of the forest. The rest of this wilderness extends into the neighboring Deerlodge and Bitterroot National Forests. The Beaverhead section includes most of the Pioneer, Gravelly, and Sapphire Ranges. Both the Centennial and Bitterroot mountain ranges are also located here, with the Continental divide found in the Bitterroot range. Lemhi Pass, at an elevation 7,323 feet (2,300 m) above sea level, is a rounded saddle in the Beaverhead Mountains of the Bitterroot Range, along the Continental Divide, between Montana and Idaho. Here, in 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition first saw the headwaters of the Columbia River, which flow to the Pacific Ocean, and crossed what was then the western boundary of the United States. Lemhi Pass was the point at which the members of the expedition realized that there was not a waterway that would lead from east to west across the continent. Lemhi Pass was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. The Lee Metcalf Wilderness, in the Madison mountain range, is a part of what is known as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. However, most of the Lee Metcalf lies in neighboring Gallatin National Forest. The Beaverhead section lies, in descending order of land area, in parts of Beaverhead, Madison, Deer Lodge, and Silver Bow counties. There are local ranger district offices located in Dillon, Ennis, Wisdom, and Wise River.\n\nThe smaller Deerlodge National Forest portion of , at 37% of the total area of the forest, encompasses much of the Tobacco Root Mountains and Flint Creek Range and parts of the Elkhorn Mountains; it straddles the Continental Divide in the Boulder and Highland Mountains. A number of ghost towns serve as reminders of the extensive mining history of the region. The Deerlodge portion of the forest, located northwest of the Beaverhead portion, lies in sections of Granite, Jefferson, Silver Bow, Deer Lodge, Powell, and Madison counties. There are local ranger district offices located in Butte, Philipsburg, and Whitehall.\n\nPonderosa pine, and various species of fir, spruce and juniper are the dominant tree species. Almost a third of the forest lands have no forest at all, and are instead rangeland with sagebrush, grass and the occasional cactus. The forest is also home to the grizzly bear, Canadian lynx, bald eagle, bull trout, Arctic grayling, and the wolf, the latter being a migrant from northern Montana and from the Yellowstone wolf reintroduction program. Elk, mule deer, moose, bighorn sheep and pronghorn and black bear are more commonly found.\n\nThe highest mountains in the forest top out at over 11,000 feet (3,400 m). The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail and the Nez Perce National Historical Trail both pass through sections of the forest. In total, there are over 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of hiking trails, 50 campgrounds, dozens of lake and river boating access points and even 250 miles (400 km) of groomed snowmobile trails.\n\nForest Service offices administering the National Forest are in Butte, Dillon (which is the headquarters location), Philipsburg, Deer Lodge, Whitehall, Boulder, Ennis, Sheridan, Wise River, Wisdom, and Lima.

Richard had launched an abortive military attempt to overthrow the Lords Appellant and negotiate peace with the kingdom of France so he could focus all his resources against his domestic enemies. The Lords Appellant counteracted the attempt and called the Parliamentary session to expose his attempts to make peace. Parliament reacted with hostility and convicted almost all of Richard's advisers of treason. Most were executed and a few exiled. Parliament was dissolved after violence broke out in Kent and the Duke of York and his allies began objecting to some executions. The term \"merciless\" was coined by Augustinian chronicler Henry Knighton.\n\nThe kingdom of England was in the midst of the Hundred Years' War with the kingdom of France, and the English had been consistently losing territory to the French since 1369. The losses were a politically sensitive topic and led to a shift in the English position after the death of Edward III, with his successor Richard II favoring peace while many of the landed nobility wanted to continue the war. The Wonderful Parliament in 1386 blamed the young King Richard's advisers for the military failures and accused them of misappropriating funds intended for the war. They authorized a commission of nobles known as the Lords Appellant to effectively take over management of the kingdom and act as Richard's regents. Richard refused to acknowledge the authority of the commission but lacked the power to challenge them. He began to devise a plan to secure his authority over the kingdom by raising an army among his allies and negotiating a secret peace with France so he could focus all his military forces against his domestic enemies. \n\nRichard began negotiations with the French in June 1387 using his agents in Hainault as intermediaries. He agreed to surrender all of England's possessions in northern France, including Calais and make peace. In exchange the French agreed to restore most of the Duchy of Aquitaine to Richard, provided he would pay homage to the king of France for it. Richard agreed to seal the treaty at a personal meeting with Charles V of France. Richard's enemies soon learned of the attempt and decided to move against him to prevent the peace treaty from being formalised.\n\nIn August, 1387, to establish a legal basis for overthrowing the appellants, Richard called seven judges of the superior courts to answer a series of questions regarding their legitimacy. Under significant duress, each of the judges agreed that the appellants had no authority and were guilty of treason and signed a statement authorizing their arrest. Armed with the legal ruling, Richard called the sheriffs of several counties to inform them they were to no longer answer to the Lords Appellant. Working with his ally Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland and Earl of Oxford, an army was raised in Chester and reinforced with royal retainers from East Anglia, the Midlands and eastern Wales. Although rumored to his enemies to be an army of 20,000, it contained no more than 4,000 men. De Vere was put in command. \n\nThe Lords Appellant became aware of Richard's dealings with the French, and later of his attempt to raise an army. Rumours began to circulate that Richard had agreed to accept military support from France, and that he would place England under French military occupation. Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, and several lesser nobles mobilized an army of their retainers numbering 4,500 and marched on de Vere's army.\n\nIn December 1387, the two armies met at Radcot-on-Thames where the Lords Appellant's army won the Battle of Radcot Bridge against the forces of Robert de Vere. The victory placed the anti-Ricardian Lords Appellant in a position of incontestable strength. Richard fled Westminster for London and barricaded himself in the Tower of London. On 27 December the Appellant's army reached the tower in full battle array and forced Richard to surrender. When the leading Appellants, the Duke of Gloucester (Thomas of Woodstock) and the Earls of Arundel, Warwick, Derby (Henry Bolingbroke, later Henry IV) and Nottingham, met with Richard on an improvised throne, they seized him and threatened to execute him for his dealings with France. Ultimately they decided against it, instead forcing him to call a session of Parliament.\n\nThe Parliamentary session began on 3 February 1388. The term \"Merciless Parliament\" was first employed by a local chronicler, Henry Knighton, who was referring to the ruthless manner in which many were convicted and executed. During the Parliament, the Appellants pursued their earlier accusations against Richard and his inner circle, almost wholly unopposed. They levelled a series of charges against Richard's advisers, accusing them of offering to surrender English-held fortresses in France and widespread embezzlement from the treasury. Most of the charges were likely false. \n\nThis meant that a number of Richard's intimate associates, namely Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk, Nicholas Brembre, Robert de Vere, Alexander Neville, and Chief Justice Robert Tresilian, were found guilty of \"living in vice, deluding the said king ... embracing the mammon of iniquity for themselves\". None were given formal trials. Neville was a bishop and spared execution, but all his assets were seized and he was exiled. The rest were ordered drawn and hanged.\n\nThe purge continued deep into the administration, dozens of retainers, clerks, chaplains, and secretaries to Richard were summarily condemned and executed. The seven judges who authorized Richard's actions under duress were arrested. The judges were the only men to be given formal trials before the House of Lords, but despite their pleas for leniency, they too were convicted and executed. As the purge continued, men less obviously involved in the plot were arrested. Richard's confessor, Thomas Rushook, Bishop of Chichester, was accused of being involved in the plot, but the House of Lords refused to try him and the Parliament adjourned on 6 March and resumed on 12 March. \n\nThe session continued through April and May as Richard's chamber knights were tried and executed. Richard's intermediaries who had been negotiating with France were discovered and executed. By the end of April, most of what remained of Richard's staff had fled to the countryside or left the country altogether and many were convicted \"in absentia\". The session began to come to an end with the trial of a knight named Simon Burley, who was accused of involvement in the plot. He was a veteran of the war and had been an adviser of the Black Prince, Richard's father. He had friends among the nobility and was a close friend of Edmund Langley, Duke of York. Langley was an influential lord who represented a significant bloc, and rose to defend Burley. The Duke of Gloucester endorsed Burley's condemnation. The two men became increasingly hostile in the first week of May. The King, who was presiding during the entire session, rose for the first time to join the Duke of York in resisting the effort. Gloucester and the King began quarreling and nearly came to blows. Before the entire council, Gloucester informed the King that if he wished to retain his crown, he should stop attempting to defend his friends. The King gave in. Burley was condemned and executed. Gloucester brought Rushook before Parliament again and he was convicted of treason and exiled to Ireland.\n\nAmong the members of King Richard's retinue to be condemned, were John Beauchamp of Holt, James Baret, and John Salisbury, who were all hanged and beheaded; Robert Bealknap (Belknap), Roger Fulthorp, William Burgh, John Locton and Sir John Cary Chief Baron of the Exchequer who were exiled to Ireland. Thomas Usk (author of \"The Testament of Love\") and John Blake, members of Brembre's and Tresilian's households respectively, were also put to death.\n\nAt the session's start, the Lords Appellant repudiated all of Richard's deals with France. The commanders of the English garrisons in France were replaced with men loyal to the Appellants, who began to pursue an aggressive war policy. Parliament however, was unwilling to grant a significant tax grant to pay for military operations. On 21 February the Parliament grudgingly agreed to a subsidy equal to half the normal subsidy granted, amounting to about £30,000 and authorized a fleet to be hired to patrol the English Channel for the year. Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, acting as agent for the French government, sent emissaries requesting that the English abide by Richard's agreement, but they were sent away without a reply. \n\nThe Duke of York was furious over the treatment of Burley, threatening to break the coalition of lords, leading Gloucester to support ending the Parliament. A series of peasant revolts broke out in Kent and southwest England, necessitating military action in late April. A second recess was agreed to after Easter and resumed on 20 May. The remainder of the session was spent dealing with financial issues and the Parliament was finally dissolved on 4 June.\n\nAfter this virtual \"coup d'état\", the Appellants continued to dominate English politics for the next year. Richard was effectively their puppet until the return of John of Gaunt from his Spanish campaigns in 1389. The power of the Appellants rested on popular support from the commons in parliament, but by the end of 1388 this support had already begun to wane. In the subsequent parliament held at Cambridge in September 1388, the commons were highly critical of the Appellants' record in government. Indeed, it has been argued that the Appellants were predominantly concerned with the task of destroying various members of Richard II's court, and after this objective had been achieved they ceased to concern themselves with the governance of England. Richard immediately began formulating plans for revenge and afterwards finally enacted a de facto peace with France with the Truce of Leulinghem. Most of the Appellants were executed during the 1390s. Gloucester was exiled to Calais where he was suffocated, probably on the orders of Richard. Bolingbroke and many other lords were eventually exiled. In 1399 Bolingbroke led a group of exiles back to England, seized the country, forced Richard to abdicate, and then starved Richard to death. Bolingbroke, Richard's cousin, was crowned Henry IV.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2318469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318469", "title": "Paddy Mayne", "text": "Paddy Mayne\n\nLieutenant Colonel Robert Blair \"Paddy\" Mayne, (11 January 1915 – 14 December 1955) was a British Army soldier from Newtownards, capped for Ireland and the British Lions at rugby union, lawyer, amateur boxer and a founding member of the Special Air Service (SAS). \n\nDuring the course of the Second World War he became one of the British Army's most highly decorated soldiers and, by destroying 47 aircraft in a single action, he may well have destroyed more German aircraft than the RAF's highest scoring ace . He was controversially denied a Victoria Cross.\n\nRobert Blair \"Paddy\" Mayne was born in Newtownards, County Down, the sixth of seven children in a Protestant family. The Maynes were prominent landowners who owned several retail businesses in the town. He was named Robert Blair after a second cousin, who at the time of his birth was a British Army officer serving in the First World War. The family home, Mount Pleasant, is situated on the hills above Newtownards. A paternal ancestor was Gordon Turnbull, who led the famous Scotland Forever Charge at Waterloo.\n\nMayne attended Regent House Grammar School. It was there that his talent for rugby union became evident, and he played for the school 1st XV and also the local Ards RFC team from the age of 16. While at school he also played cricket and golf, and showed aptitude as a marksman in the rifle club. On leaving school he studied law at Queen's University of Belfast, studying to become a solicitor. While at university he took up boxing, becoming Irish Universities Heavyweight Champion in August 1936. He followed this by reaching the final of the British Universities Heavyweight Championship, but was beaten on points. With a handicap of 8, he won the Scrabo Golf Club President's Cup the next year. While at university Mayne was an officer cadet with the Queen's University, Belfast Contingent, Officer Training Corps.\n\nMayne's first full Ireland rugby cap also came in 1937, in a match against Wales. After gaining five more caps for Ireland as a lock forward, Mayne was selected for the 1938 British Lions tour to South Africa. While the Lions lost the first test, a South African newspaper stated Mayne was \"outstanding in a pack which gamely and untiringly stood up to the tremendous task\". He played in seventeen of the twenty provincial matches and in all three tests. On returning from South Africa, he joined Malone RFC in Belfast.\n\nWhile on tour in South Africa with the Lions in 1938, Mayne's rambunctious nature came to the fore, smashing up colleagues' hotel rooms, temporarily freeing a convict he had befriended and who was working on the construction of the Ellis Park Stadium and also sneaking off from a formal dinner to go antelope hunting.\n\nIn early 1939 Mayne graduated from Queen's and joined George Maclaine & Co in Belfast, having been articled to TCG Mackintosh for the five previous years. Mayne won praise during the three Ireland matches he played in 1939, with one report stating \"Mayne, whose quiet almost ruthless efficiency is in direct contrast to O'Loughlin's exuberance, appears on the slow side, but he covers the ground at an extraordinary speed for a man of his build, as many a three quarter and full back have discovered.\" His legal and sporting careers were cut short by the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nIn March 1939, prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, Mayne had joined the Supplementary Reserve in Newtownards and received a commission in the Royal Artillery, being posted to 5 Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, in 8th Anti-Aircraft Regiment, later 8th (Belfast) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment. When the battery was assigned to 9th Anti-Aircraft Regiment (later 9th (Londonderry) Heavy AA Regiment) for overseas' service, Mayne was transferred out to 66th Light AA Regiment in Northern Ireland. Then, in April 1940, he was transferred again, this time to the Royal Ulster Rifles. \n\nFollowing Churchill's call to form a \"butcher and bolt\" raiding force following the evacuation of Dunkirk, Mayne volunteered for the newly formed No. 11 (Scottish) Commando. He first saw action in June 1941 as a second-lieutenant with 11 Commando during the Syria–Lebanon Campaign. Mayne successfully led a section of men during the Litani River operation in Lebanon against Vichy French Forces. The operation was commanded by Major Dick Pedder, Highland Light Infantry, who was killed in action. Mayne played a distinguished part in the raid, for which he was awarded a mention in despatches.\n\nMayne's name was recommended to Captain David Stirling by his friend Lt. Eoin McGonigal, a fellow officer of No. 11 (Scottish) Commando, and an early volunteer for the Special Air Service (SAS) – then known simply as the Parachute Unit. It is widely believed that Mayne was under arrest for hitting his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Charles Tasker Keyes when Stirling met him. This story is untrue. A hand-written entry in Keyes' personal diary proves conclusively that he was not at the officer's mess of No. 11 (Scottish) Commando at Salamis on Cyprus on the evening of 21 June 1941, the date on which Mayne was accused of beating up a fellow officer, Major Charles Napier. Keyes had stayed the night elsewhere, and arrived at Salamis the following day, 22 June 1941, when the trouble was already over. Keyes states in his diary that he conducted an investigation and found Mayne responsible.\n\nKeyes' diary makes it clear that Mayne was brought before the divisional commander, Brigadier Rodwell, on 23 June, for assaulting Napier, the second-in-command of his battalion. Mayne had a grudge against Napier, who had not taken part in the Litani raid, and who, according to a serving member of 11 Commando, had shot Mayne's pet dog while Mayne had been away. Mayne was attached to his pet (there is a famous photo of him carrying a dog on his shoulders), and was furious about this. Keyes' diary records that, on the evening of 21 June, after drinking heavily in the mess, Mayne waited by Napier's tent and assaulted him when he returned. Keyes also records in his diary that Mayne was dismissed from 11 Commando the following day, 23 June, but does not say that he was arrested.\n\nThere is no proof that Mayne was under arrest or in prison when Stirling first met him, nor that Stirling obtained his release so that he could join the newly formed SAS. \n\nFrom November 1941 through to the end of 1942, Mayne participated in many night raids deep behind enemy lines in the deserts of Egypt and Libya, where the SAS wrought havoc by destroying many enemy aircraft on the ground. Mayne pioneered the use of military jeeps to conduct surprise hit-and-run raids, particularly on Axis airfields. It was claimed that he had personally destroyed up to 100 aircraft. \n\nHis first successful raid at Wadi Tamet on 14 December 1941, where aircraft and petrol dumps were destroyed, helped keep the SAS in existence, following the failure of the previous initial raid behind enemy lines. For his part in the Tamet raid Mayne was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). He also received a mention in despatches on 24 February 1942.\nMayne's official report on the Tamet raid notes:\n\nMayne took part in the most successful SAS raid of the Desert war when on the night of 26 July 1942 with eighteen armed Jeeps, he along with Stirling raided the Sidi Haneish Airfield. They avoided detection, destroyed up to 40 German aircraft and escaped with the loss of only three Jeeps and two men killed. The regular Army wanted to disband the SAS but the success helped keep the critics at bay.\n\nFollowing Stirling's capture in January 1943, 1st SAS Regiment was reorganised into two separate parts, the Special Raiding Squadron (SRS) and the Special Boat Section (the forerunner of the Special Boat Service). As a major, Mayne was appointed to command the Special Raiding Squadron and led the unit in Sicily and Italy until the end of 1943. In Sicily, Mayne was awarded a Bar to his DSO. The official citation reads as follows:\n\nIn January 1944 Mayne was promoted to lieutenant colonel and appointed commanding officer of the re-formed 1st SAS Regiment. He subsequently led the SAS with great distinction through the final campaigns of the war in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Norway, often campaigning alongside local resistance fighters including the French Maquis. In recognition of his leadership and personal disregard for danger while in France, in which he trained and worked closely with the French Resistance, Mayne received the second Bar to his DSO. The official citation stated:\nDuring the course of the war he became one of the British Army's most highly decorated soldiers and received the DSO with three Bars, one of only seven British servicemen to receive that award four times during the Second World War. Additionally, the post-war French Government awarded him the Legion of Honour and the Croix de guerre.\n\nDuring the 1938 Lions tour it is said that Mayne relaxed by \"wrecking hotels and fighting dockers\". During the war, his men admired him in battle but were very wary of him during quiet times once he had consumed alcohol. Many urban legends of his post-war years exist in Belfast and Newtownards. These mostly tell of incidents in which, after drinking for several hours, Mayne would challenge every man in the bar to a fight, which he would invariably win. Other accounts describe him as a courageous leader of his men and a ferocious opponent. \n\nMayne is also described as growing increasingly withdrawn as the war progressed, preferring books to the company of friends. This tendency was said to have become more marked after the death of his father during World War II. Mayne was refused leave to attend the funeral and a story has him embarking on a drinking binge and rampage in central Cairo in an effort to find and beat up Richard Dimbleby, although Dimbleby may have been in London at the time. After separating fact from myth, it is clear that Mayne was an extraordinary war hero, and some of the criticism comes from disbelief that one man could have achieved what Mayne achieved, without injury, although Mayne suffered from longstanding back pain sustained in the Western Desert.\n\nMayne was inclined to remonstrate with colleagues in the armed services who showed little or no understanding of the complex politics of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe question of why Mayne was not awarded a Victoria Cross was raised by his contemporaries, and the matter came to a head when brought before British Parliament in January 2006 after a public campaign to re-open the case. The British Government declined to do so, though the Blair Mayne Association vowed to continue their campaign to have the Victoria Cross retroactively awarded. Mayne's actions were not in doubt and his citation, approved by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, commander of the Allied 21st Army Group, noted that he led two armoured jeep squadrons through the front lines toward Oldenburg. \n\nThe success of his mission to clear a path for the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division and sow disorganization among the enemy was due to his \"brilliant military leadership and cool calculating courage\" and a \"single act of bravery\" which \"drove the enemy from a strongly held key village thereby breaking the crust of the enemy defences in the whole of this sector.\" However, in a standard practice of the time, the award was downgraded to a lesser award, and Mayne received instead a third bar to the DSO (in other words, a fourth award of the DSO).\n\nMajor General Sir Robert Laycock, Postwar Chief of Combined Operations, wrote:\n\nAn Early Day Motion put before the House of Commons in June 2005 and supported by more than 100 MPs also stated that: \n\nAfter a period with the British Antarctic Survey in the Falkland Islands, cut short by a crippling back complaint that had begun during his army days, Mayne returned to Newtownards to work first as a solicitor and then as Secretary to the Law Society of Northern Ireland. He suffered severe back pain which prevented him from even watching rugby as a spectator. He rarely talked about his wartime service.\n\nOn the night of Tuesday 13 December 1955, after attending a regular meeting of the Friendship Lodge, Mayne continued drinking with a masonic friend in the nearby town of Bangor, before making his way home in the early hours. At about 4am he was found dead in his Riley roadster in Mill Street, Newtownards, having reportedly collided with a farmer’s vehicle. \n\nAt his funeral hundreds of mourners turned out to pay their respects and to see him interred in a family plot in the town’s old Movilla Abbey graveyard. After his death his masonic jewel was preserved for many years by an old schoolfriend before it was presented to Newtownards Borough Council where it was displayed in the Mayoral Chamber of the Council Offices.\n\nA less-than lifesize bronze statue of Blair Mayne stands in Conway Square, Newtownards, and the western bypass of the town is also named in his honour.\nIn 2003 a temporary British Army base in Kuwait, occupied by the first battalion of the Royal Irish Regiment, was named after him – Camp Blair Mayne. It was there that Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins, 1 Battalion, the Royal Irish Regiment's commanding officer (himself a former SAS officer), gave his celebrated address to his troops on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nA film of Blair Mayne's life has long been mooted. Eddie Irvine has become executive producer for the film.\n\nA number of books have been written about Mayne, the first being \"Colonel Paddy\" by Patrick Marrinan (1960).\n\n\"Rogue Warrior of the SAS: the Blair Mayne legend\" was written by Roy Bradford and Martin Dillon (1989, updated 2003) and features a foreword by David Stirling, who endorses the book. It purports to separate the facts from myths.\n\n\"Paddy Mayne\" by Hamish Ross (2004) has also sought to debunk the myths and concerning Mayne's character and exploits, preferring a more circumspect account based on tangible evidence. Ross's book is endorsed by the Mayne family.\n\n\"The Regiment\" by Michael Asher (2007) contains a detailed account of Mayne's part in the creation of the SAS Regiment, and credits Mayne, rather than Stirling, with the main role in perpetuating it. Asher presents the most accurate account of Mayne's dismissal from 11 Commando, for striking his 2 i/c, Charles Napier, rather than his CO, Geoffrey Keyes (based on entries from Keyes' personal diaries, property of Lord Roger Keyes, Private Collection)\n\nAnother book, \"SAS: The History of the Special Raiding Squadron: Paddy's Men\" by Stewart McClean was published in early 2006.\n\n\"Legendary Warrior of the SAS\" by John O'Neill was published in 2012 and describes his character and publishes for the first time letters to family.\n\n\"Stirling's Men: the inside history of the SAS in World War Two\", by Gavin Mortimer [Cassell, 2004], also features extensive accounts, both of Mayne's exploits and of his character, by many soldiers who served with him in the SAS.\n\n"}

Pina also serves as a Country Expert on Haiti for the Varieties of Democracy project sponsored by the University of Notre Dame Center for Research Computing, the University of Gothenburg Department of Political Science, and the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies.\n\nPina is known for his reporting focusing on human rights abuses in Haiti following the ouster of Jean-Bertrand Aristide on February 29, 2004 and the installation of the interim government of Gerard Latortue and Boniface Alexandre in March 2004. Pina reported on events in Haiti between 2003 and 2006 as a Special Correspondent for the radio program, \"Flashpoints\", heard on KPFA – the flagship station of Pacifica Radio based in Berkeley, California.\n\nKevin Pina began reporting from Haiti in 1991 for the KPFA News in the United States. He reported on human rights violations committed by the Haitian military in the poor neighborhood of Cité Soleil following the coup of September 30, 1991 that was led by Raoul Cédras and Michel François. In late July 1993, he was declared persona non-grata and deported by General Raoul Cedras following a drive-by shooting during an interview with Senator Thomas Eddy Dupiton in Canape Verte.\n\nPina's first Haiti documentary, \"\", focused on the formation of Aristide's Lavalas political movement, the military coup of 1991 and Aristide's eventual return from exile in October 1994. The Haitian Creole version of \"Haiti: Harvest of Hope\" was narrated by Haitian poet Jean-Claude Martineau and premiered in Haiti on Haitian Mother's Day in May 1995. The English version is narrated by the actor Roscoe Lee Brown and was released for distribution in the U.S. in 1997.\n\nIn early January 1999, Pina moved to Port-au-Prince where he lived and worked for the next seven years. He was the first journalist to write that paramilitary forces of the former Haitian military and the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haïti (FRAPH), operating in the neighboring Dominican Republic, were being used as part of a larger strategy to oust the government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in April 2003.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2003 Pina was hired as an independent consultant for Télévision Nationale d'Haïti (TNH), a government owned station, to teach camera and digital editing. Pina was contracted concurrently for a similar position with the privately owned station Tele-Haiti in 2003, and later became the Station Manager for Haiti's largest privately owned television station TeleMax in early 2004.\n\nAccording to Yves Engler and Anthony Fenton in their book \"Haiti: Waging War on the Poor Majority\", Pina was beaten by an off-duty SWAT officer of the Haitian National Police on June 4, 2005. In subsequent interviews, Pina said he believed this was retribution for his actions during a demonstration on May 18, 2005 where he and several Haitian journalists blocked police from firing on unarmed protesters. A Brazilian military commander, working for the United Nations mission in Haiti known as MINUSTAH, gave orders to have Pina's picture taken during the demonstration while threatening, \"You are always making trouble for us. I have taken your picture and I am going to give it to the Haitian police. They will get you.\" \n\nPina was arrested in Haiti on September 9, 2005 and held in jail for three days after attempting to videotape a search by Judge Jean Pérs Paul in the church of prisoner of conscience Father Gérard Jean-Juste. Pina later said he had gone to St. Claire's parish because he had received information that the judge intended to plant weapons in Jean-Juste's rectory to justify holding the priest in prison.\n\nAfter , Pina released a second video entitled \"Haiti: The UNtold Story\". The film chronicles human rights abuses by the Haitian police and a military assault on July 6, 2005 by United Nations forces where residents accuse them of massacring civilians in the impoverished neighborhood of Cité Soleil. \"Haiti: The UNtold Story\" was an earlier version of Pina's latest documentary, \"Haiti: We must kill the Bandits\", subsequently re-edited for a final release in 2009 at the Bahamas International Film Festival. Although \"Haiti: We must kill the Bandits\" recycles rare footage from Pina's earlier documentary \"Haiti: Harvest of Hope\" for context, most of the video is original footage shot between 2004-2006.\n\nPina's film credits and videography include \"El Salvador: In the Name of Democracy\" (1985), \"Berkeley in the Sixties\" (1990), \"Amazonia: Voices from the Rainforest\" (1990), \"\" (1997), \"Haiti: The UNtold Story\" (2005) and \"HAITI: We Must Kill the Bandits\" (2007).\n\n"}

It was written by Jane Espenson, directed by Regis Kimble, and first broadcast, out of sequence, on September 21, 1999. The originally scheduled broadcast was postponed following the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999.\n\nOn patrol, Buffy runs into two mouthless demons and succeeds in killing one, but some of its blood is absorbed through her skin. When her hand starts itching, Giles explains that she may be infected with an aspect of the demon. Buffy worries about what aspect she will be getting and is horrified when Willow wonders if the demon was male.\n\nThe next day, as she is walking through the halls, Buffy finds that she can hear the thoughts of others. In class, she answers the teacher's questions by listening to the thoughts of her classmates. She also hears the thoughts of Freddy Iverson, who writes editorials for the school newspaper and who has a negative opinion about everything at Sunnydale.\n\nLater that day, Buffy goes to the mansion to use her mind-reading abilities to check up on Angel and find out the truth about what happened between him and Faith. He informs her that she can no more read his mind than see his image in a mirror. He tells her that what happened with Faith meant nothing and that in 243 years, he has loved only Buffy.\n\nAt the library, Buffy tells her friends about her ability to read minds. She learns that Xander constantly thinks about sex, Cordelia says almost exactly what she thinks, Oz thinks extremely deep thoughts, Willow thinks about how she is left out of things, and Wesley thinks about Cordelia romantically but reprimands himself for having amorous feelings for an underage girl.\n\nIn the lunchroom, Buffy hears that someone is planning to kill all the students. She tells everyone to get organized and find out who the potential killer is. Buffy goes home to rest while Willow and the others go around interviewing students and faculty.\n\nAngel hunts down the surviving demon and brings its heart in a glass mixed with other ingredients, after Buffy finds the effects of mind-reading to be stressful and distracting. He forces Buffy to drink it and she goes into convulsions. When she wakes up, she is no longer able to hear thoughts.\n\nWillow and the rest of the Scooby Gang locate all the students on the list except Freddy Iverson, so they all go looking for him. They finally corner Freddy in his office and learn that he is not the potential killer. They find a letter from Jonathan apologizing for his upcoming actions. The gang finds Jonathan in the clock tower, assembling a rifle. Buffy takes it from him, and then discovers that he was planning to kill only himself. Xander checks the kitchen and stumbles upon a lunch lady putting rat poison into the food. She tries to kill him with a cleaver, but Buffy knocks her unconscious.\n\nGiles and Buffy recap what happened as they walk in the school grounds. Buffy tells Giles that she now knows he had sex with her mother; Giles walks into a tree.\n\nIn her commentary on the DVD, writer Jane Espenson reveals that when she found out that she was going to write this episode she knew that she wanted the student in the tower to be Jonathan. Even though Danny Strong had only had small, comedic parts on the series over the years, she had faith that he would be able to handle the dramatic scene. Espenson also mentions in her commentary that she included the exchange in which Buffy discovers that her mother slept with Giles in \"Band Candy\" because she was surprised that fans were not sure that they had had sex and she wanted to eliminate any doubts. James South wrote that Oz's thoughts, overheard by Buffy, \"I am my thoughts... if they exist in her, Buffy contains everything that is me, and she becomes me. I cease to exist.\" is a reference to the philosopher Descartes.\n\nGiles walking right into a tree after Buffy told him she knew he slept with her mother was Anthony Head's idea, although he did not expect that Joss Whedon would actually let him do it.\n\nThe Columbine High School massacre occurred one week before the episode was originally scheduled to air. Because it included a scene with a student loading a rifle – apparently for mass murder, but in reality for suicide – the WB substituted a rerun of \"Bad Girls\". The episode was delayed until September 1999, two weeks prior to the season four premiere. The season finale was also delayed due to \"school violence concerns\".\n\nNoel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" criticized the portrayal of telepathy in the episode, and generally on T.V. and film, but praised the humorous and poignant insights it gave into what Buffy's friends were thinking. A review for the BBC praised the concept of Buffy the mind reader, but was less impressed by the plot's more routine group investigation.\n\n"}

It was the 109th annual grand final of the Australian Football League (formerly the Victorian Football League), staged to determine the premiers for the 2005 AFL season. The match, attended by 91,898 spectators, was won by Sydney by a margin of four points, marking the club's fourth Premiership and their first since 1933.\n\nIt remains the highest-rating AFL game of all time (with 3.4 million metropolitan viewers), since the current OzTam measurement system was introduced in 2001.\n\nThis was West Coast's first appearance in a grand final since winning the 1994 premiership, whilst it was Sydney's first since losing in 1996, and the Swans had not won a premiership since 1933 (as South Melbourne). \n\nTwo players from the Eagles' last premiership in 1994 were appearing in this grand final, Drew Banfield for the Eagles and Jason Ball for the Swans in his last AFL game.\n\nAt the conclusion of the home and away season, West Coast finished second on the AFL ladder behind Adelaide with 17 wins and five losses. Sydney finished third with 15 wins and seven losses. They met in the qualifying final at Domain Stadium, and West Coast won by four points.\n\nA major turning point in the Swans' season came when they lost to at Marvel Stadium in round ten, after which Swans coach Paul Roos came under heavy criticism from the entire AFL for his side's game plan.\n\nThe Eagles then punched their ticket to the grand final by defeating minor premiers Adelaide in their preliminary final by 16 points. Meanwhile, Nick Davis famously rescued Sydney in their semifinal at the SCG against Geelong with four 4th-quarter goals including one just seconds before the final siren. The Swans then overcame St Kilda in their preliminary final at the MCG after overturning a 7-point deficit going into the last quarter into a 31-point win with a seven-goal barrage.\n\nIn the week leading up to the grand final, West Coast's Ben Cousins was awarded the Brownlow Medal.\n\nWest Coast opened the game aggressively, with Sydney struggling to get the ball to their end of the field. However, better goal kicking accuracy by the Swans put them ahead by two points at the first change.\n\nIn the second quarter Sydney appeared to be asserting control of the game, kicking three goals while the Eagles got none. However, after the long break, West Coast put their stamp on the game, kicking three goals while the Swans went goalless.\n\nBoth teams had seemingly easy goals that were missed, but the Eagles most clearly would remember theirs from the fourth quarter. With just under five minutes remaining in the match, West Coast's Brent Staker almost cost his team the match following a 50-metre penalty to the Swans sending them out of their defensive 50 in a very costly play. With the Swans holding a five-point lead in the closing moments, Sydney's Tadhg Kennelly rushed a behind to blunt a ferocious Eagles attack. After the ensuing kick in, West Coast regained control of the ball and sent a long kick back to the half forward line by Dean Cox. Sydney's Leo Barry responded by taking a mark in the midst of the pack full of Eagles players (with the commentator Stephen Quartermain mentioning words made famous through frequent replays - \"Leo Barry you star!\"), denying the Eagles an opportunity to kick a game winner on or after the final siren, thus ensuring that the Swans would win their first premiership in 72 years (when they were South Melbourne), ending the longest premiership drought in VFL/AFL history.\n\nThe match has been labelled as a 'classic', with the final margin being the closest since the 1977 drawn grand final. This was the first time since the 1989 VFL Grand Final that the grand final was decided by a goal or less.\n\nEagles player Chris Judd was awarded the Norm Smith Medal for being judged the best player afield, although he finished on the losing side; this is one of only four instances of a grand final player having won a Norm Smith Medal without being on the winning premiership team.\n\nThe same teams met again in the 2006 AFL Grand Final, in another close match, with the Eagles emerging victors by one point.\n\n"}

It was written by David Fury, directed by James A. Contner, and first broadcast on May 4, 1999.\n\nThe Box of Gavrok is due to arrive by courier at the airport; the Mayor offers Faith a knife in return for intercepting it. Buffy tells Wesley and Giles that she wants out of Sunnydale. She offers a deal: if she takes the offensive against the Mayor, defeats him, and stops the ascension, they could afford to be Slayerless for long enough for her to go away to college.\n\nThat night, Faith kills the courier, and separates him from the box by taking off his hand. Watching from the bushes, Buffy sees Faith deliver the box to the Mayor. After the coast is clear, Buffy forces the driver to disclose information about the box before staking him.\n\nThe gang plan an attack on City Hall to steal the Box of Gavrok. First, Willow will remove the magic protecting the box so Buffy and Angel can take it. Then, Xander and Oz will prepare the ritual Willow will use to destroy the box.\n\nWesley and Giles drop off Buffy, Willow and Angel at City Hall. Everything goes fine until Buffy's guy rope sticks and an alarm goes off. As two vampires enter, Angel drops to Buffy's rescue. After a fight, they escape with the box. The Mayor's anger and the gang's relief reverse when it is discovered that Faith has captured Willow.\n\nA library discussion ensues: is Willow's life worth those of the many thousands who would be saved if the box is destroyed? Oz settles the matter by smashing the pot containing the potion needed for the ritual. Buffy tells Giles to set up a meeting to exchange Willow for the Box of Gavrok.\n\nAt City Hall, Willow escapes from the room she is imprisoned in and examines the Mayor's office. She is reading the Books of Ascension when Faith finds her. Giles's call comes in time to stop Faith from killing her.\n\nThe meeting is in the school cafeteria where the Mayor tells Buffy and Angel that they have no future together. They make the trade, but are disrupted by Principal Snyder and his security guards, bent on drug-busting. One of the guards opens the box and a large beetle-like creature jumps out and kills him. Another beetle breaks free and the two attack the Mayor and Buffy. Both beetles are killed.\n\nBack at the library, Willow presents Giles with a few important pages she tore from the Books of Ascension. Wesley counts the cost of her rescue: the gang are now back exactly where they started, with no way to stop the Ascension.\n\nAt school the next day, Buffy and Willow talk again about their future. Buffy knows she can not leave Sunnydale; Willow now knows she does not want to leave because fighting evil and studying Wicca are what she wants to do. Both will attend UC Sunnydale.\n\nNoel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" described \"Choices\" as \"an exciting episode, marked by an especially rousing score and some of the best fight scenes I've yet seen on the show\". He went on to praise Willow's character development, and the way the episode \"reinforced its theme in nearly every plot point, line of dialogue and set dressing\". A review for the BBC criticised the plot, particularly Willow being kidnapped and staying to read the Books of Ascension rather than escaping, but praised the character interactions and Alyson Hannigan's performance.\n\n"}

It is used in the study of solutions of Maxwell's equations and has applications in Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\nThe electromagnetic field at a point \"p\" (i.e. an event) of a Lorentzian spacetime is represented by a real bivector defined over the tangent space at \"p\".\n\nThe tangent space at \"p\" is isometric as a real inner product space to E. That is, it has the same notion of vector magnitude and angle as Minkowski spacetime. To simplify the notation, we will assume the spacetime \"is\" Minkowski spacetime. This tends to blur the distinction between the tangent space at \"p\" and the underlying manifold; fortunately, nothing is lost by this specialization, for reasons we discuss as the end of the article.\n\nThe classification theorem for electromagnetic fields characterizes the bivector \"F\" in relation to the Lorentzian metric by defining and examining the so-called \"principal null directions\". Let us explain this.\n\nThe bivector \"F\" yields a skew-symmetric linear operator defined by lowering one index with the metric. It acts on the tangent space at \"p\" by . We will use the symbol \"F\" to denote either the bivector or the operator, according to context.\n\nWe mention a dichotomy drawn from exterior algebra. A bivector that can be written as , where \"v\", \"w\" are linearly independent, is called \"simple\". Any nonzero bivector over a 4-dimensional vector space either is simple, or can be written as , where \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", and \"y\" are linearly independent; the two cases are mutually exclusive. Stated like this, the dichotomy makes no reference to the metric \"η\", only to exterior algebra. But it is easily seen that the associated skew-symmetric linear operator \"F\" has rank 2 in the former case and rank 4 in the latter case.\n\nTo state the classification theorem, we consider the \"eigenvalue problem\" for \"F\", that is, the problem of finding eigenvalues \"λ\" and eigenvectors \"r\" which satisfy the eigenvalue equation\nThe skew-symmetry of \"F\" implies that:\n\n\nA 1-dimensional subspace generated by a null eigenvector is called a \"principal null direction\" of the bivector.\n\nThe classification theorem characterizes the possible principal null directions of a bivector. It states that one of the following must hold for any nonzero bivector:\nFurthermore, for any non-null bivector, the two eigenvalues associated with the two distinct principal null directions have the same magnitude but opposite sign, , so we have three subclasses of non-null bivectors:\nwhere the rank refers to the rank of the linear operator \"F\".\n\nThe algebraic classification of bivectors given above has an important application in relativistic physics: the electromagnetic field is represented by a skew-symmetric second rank tensor field (the electromagnetic field tensor) so we immediately obtain an algebraic classification of electromagnetic fields.\n\nIn a cartesian chart on Minkowski spacetime, the electromagnetic field tensor has components\nwhere formula_3 and formula_4 denote respectively the components of the electric and magnetic fields, as measured by an inertial observer (at rest in our coordinates). As usual in relativistic physics, we will find it convenient to work with geometrised units in which formula_5. In the \"Index gymnastics\" formalism of special relativity, the Minkowski metric formula_6 is used to raise and lower indices.\n\nThe fundamental invariants of the electromagnetic field are:\n\nA null electromagnetic field is characterised by formula_9. In this case, the invariants reveal that the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular and that they are of the same magnitude (in geometrised units). An example of a null field is a plane electromagnetic wave in Minkowski space.\n\nA non-null field is characterised by formula_10. If formula_11, there exists an inertial reference frame for which either the electric or magnetic field vanishes. (These correspond respectively to \"magnetostatic\" and \"electrostatic\" fields.) If formula_12, there exists an inertial frame in which electric and magnetic fields are proportional.\n\nSo far we have discussed only Minkowski spacetime. According to the (strong) equivalence principle, if we simply replace \"inertial frame\" above with a frame field, everything works out exactly the same way on curved manifolds.\n\n\n"}

It was written by Marti Noxon, directed by David Solomon, and first broadcast on May 11, 1999.\n\nAt school, Anya asks Xander to the Prom. Later, Buffy, Willow, Oz, and Xander discuss prom plans, and dresses. Buffy's mother Joyce visits Angel at the mansion and tells him that he cannot get in the way of Buffy's future, and that he will have to do something about it.\n\nWhile patrolling, Buffy and Angel have an argument. Angel tells Buffy that it is unfair for her to be in a relationship with him because of all the things he can't give her, and breaks up with her. He also reveals that he will be leaving Sunnydale after the ascension in hopes that Buffy will have a normal life. In a small house, someone plays a video for a caged beast that makes it go wild.\n\nAt the store where Cordelia secretly works, Xander spots her through the window and goes in to tease her for what he thinks is her spending a long time trying to pick a dress. She reveals that she is working there to save up for a prom dress, because her family lost all of their money. The argument is cut short as a beast breaks through the window and kills a boy dressed in a tuxedo.\n\nAt the library, the gang study the video of the attack, and identify Tucker Wells, who used to have a chemistry class with Oz. Tucker has plans to ruin prom night by sending a hellhound to attack the students in formal wear, because he was turned down for a prom date. Buffy vows not to let the hellhound ruin the big night and issues orders for everyone to split up and search for clues. As Cordelia leaves work, she finds that her prom dress has been paid for.\n\nBuffy returns from her searching and orders everyone else to attend the prom while she takes care of Tucker. She finds him in his basement and ties him up before he can release the hellhound, but three more she did not know about are already on their way to the school. After killing all of them, Buffy changes into her prom dress and shows up for the dance. Cordelia thanks Xander for paying for her dress and dances with Wesley while Anya tells Xander of her past cursing unfaithful men as a vengeance demon, and Willow and Oz just enjoy the evening.\n\nWhen Class awards are given out, Buffy is given an ornately decorated parasol bearing a small engraving saying 'Buffy Summers — Class Protector'. Angel surprises her by showing up in a tux and they dance. He tells her he understands that it's an important night for her, but it doesn't change anything between them, which she understands.\n\nIn the scene where Angel breaks up with Buffy, Sarah Michelle Gellar admits that she \"could not stop crying,\" and the set was closed for 25 minutes to allow her to recover.\n\nA review for the BBC praised the acting and writing of the break-up scene, but thought too much time was spent on the prom scene compared with the monster-of-the-week plot.\n\n"}

Orochimaru goes after them, transforming into a giant serpent. He sank the boat and almost succeeded in killing Ikazuchi-Maru, until a giant eagle flew in, injured Orochimaru, and saved the young boy.\n\nYears later, Ikazuchi-Maru (Matsukata Hiroki), now a young man, has mastered the art of ninjutsu and toad magic, thanks to an old hermit named Dojin Hiki (Nobuo Kaneko). When a band of ninja sent by Daijo Yuki try to attack Ikazuchi-Maru, the young ninja puts his skills to the test. Along the way, he meets a beautiful young girl named Tsunade (Tomoko Ogawa), whom he becomes friends with. Meanwhile, Hiki is confronted by Orochimaru, who turns out to be an old apprentice of his! Hiki also turned out to be the giant eagle that saved the young Ikazuchi-Maru and gave his former pupil a scar on his head (when he was in serpent form). Orochimaru then attacks the old master with ninja magic and poisons him. Ikazuchi-Maru and Tsunade return almost too late, as the dying Hiki tells him all he needs to know about Orochimaru, telling his pupil to avenge his death. And just before he dies, he reacts to Tsunade in shock, as though he realized something about her. Before setting out on his mission to avenge his master, Ikazuchi-Maru says farewell to Tsunade, who is taken care of by an old \"spider\" woman (Sen Hara), who tells her to follow the young man. She gives the young woman a spider hairpin, with which she can summon a giant spider, but she can do so only once, lest the giant spider will turn on her if used more than once.\n\nThe course of Ikazuchi-Maru's journey has him befriending a girl named Saki (Yumi Suzumura) and her little brother Shirota (Takao Iwamura), whose village was oppressed by Daijo Yuki's men. Yuki himself tries to execute Saki and Shirota for treason, only to be attacked by Ikazuchi-Maru, who proclaims himself to be the invincible ninja \"Jiraiya\"! Demanding revenge against Yuki for the murder of his parents and the overthrow of his kingdom, Jiraiya is then confronted by Orochimaru, whom he duels with spectacular ninja magic. We also learn of a shocking secret about Tsunade; She is the daughter of Orochimaru! Her father urges her to kill Jiraiya with poison (after a hired assassin failed to kill him also). After these failed attempts on his life, Jiraiya sets out to rescue Saki and Shirota from Yuki (who was in the midst of celebrating with his kingdom). He transforms into a giant toad, rampaging Yuki's stronghold. Orochimaru confronts Jiraiya in his powerful giant serpent form, and a spectacular showdown between two giant magical forces ensues.\n\n\"The Magic Serpent\" was released in Japan in 1966.

Until the takeover the company name was \"Kabel Deutschland\".\n\nVodafone Kabel Deutschland GmbH (VKD), operates in 13 of the 16 states of Germany except Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse. In 2006, of the 15.4 million households passed by their cable the company served 9.6 million, however only one third of these are direct customers of Kabel Deutschland, since especially in large apartment complexes the in-house cable networks are owned by cable service companies or housing associations.\n\nKabel Deutschland was founded in January 1999 by the former German telecom monopoly Deutsche Telekom operating as Deutsche Telekom Kabel Services GmbH (DeTeKS) in order to spin off its entire Cable Television business as required by regulatory terms.

On 23 September the deal was approved by the European Commission, and shortly after Vodafone completed its acquisition of 76.57% of shares in the company.\n\nWith a basic plan, Kabel Deutschland offers about 30 free-to-air analogue TV and an equal number of FM and digital radio channels. All analogue TV channels are available in the digital DVB-C encoding format, Plus an additional 70 television channels are not available in analogue.\n\nOn top of that, about 100 digital pay TV channels can be ordered as a subscription-based service. This includes Germany's pay TV broadcasters Sky Deutschland as well as Kabel Deutschland's own offerings.\n\nOn February 1, 2012, Kabel Deutschland ceased to use the Astra 23.5°E position for distribution, switching to its terrestrial fibre network.\n\nFurthermore, Kabel Deutschland offers Internet (\"Kabel Internet\", up to 200 MBit/s downstream and 12 MBit/s upstream from November 2014) and telephone services (\"Kabel Phone\").\n\nFor historic reasons, Kabel Deutschland cannot offer its products directly to all who are connected via Kabel Deutschland's network, since only one third of all viewers are direct customers. In the early 1980s, when the cable network was established, Kabel Deutschland's predecessor, Deutsche Bundespost had to leave in-house cables to other companies or the house owners. This turned out to be a significant obstacle since Kabel Deutschland now has to make single contracts with hundreds of small cable operators.\n"}

It promotes excellence among solicitors through the support and regulation of its members. It also promotes the interests of the public in relation to the profession. The Society helps to shape the law for the benefit of both the public and the profession.\n\nThe Society was established by statute in 1949 and its rules are set out in the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980. All practising solicitors, currently around 10,500, are members. The Society is funded by its members and has an annual budget of almost £8 million.\n\nLawyers in Scotland have been organised in professional bodies since at least the sixteenth century. The Faculty of Advocates was established as the body for practising advocates in 1532, though its origins are thought to date from even earlier. Other lawyers were represented by associations and faculties of procurators and solicitors. Among those that still exist, the Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet (WS Society) was formally established in 1594 and the Royal Faculty of Procurators in Glasgow was incorporated before 1668.\n\nAs the legal profession expanded in line with the volume of legislation introduced in the twentieth century, it became clear that a representative body for all solicitors was needed along with reform of the informal system of lawyers voluntarily providing legal services to those who could not afford representation, which had existed since 1424. The Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1949 established the Law Society of Scotland as the governing body for solicitors at the same time as it laid the foundation of the modern legal aid and assistance scheme.\n\nSolicitors elect representatives to sit on the Society's Council, the ruling body. The Council has overall responsibility for strategy and policy. The work of the Council is supported by the management Board, which draws members from the Council and the Society's executive staff. This is the principal decision-making team at the Society.\n\nThe Society's president and the vice president hold office for one year. The current president is Graham Matthews, while Alison Atack is the vice president. The other office bearers are the treasurer and immediate past president, John Mulholland and Eilidh Wiseman respectively. The chief executive is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Society, working with a staff of approximately 120. The current chief executive is Lorna Jack.\n\nMost of the Society’s departments are grouped in five main areas of work: regulation and standards; member services and engagement; education, training and qualifications; external relations; finance and operations. Other departments work within those areas. Policy is developed by teams in external relations and education, training and qualifications.\n\nThe work of the Society is supported by solicitors and non-solicitors who contribute their time and expertise through many committees and working groups.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014 the Society went through a process to reform its structures and governance. Some new committees and the management Board were established as part of this governance reform. A consultation on the composition and election of the Council was held and a new constitution drafted.\n\n"}

He later claimed to have perfected the art of \"running away from a ball while seeming to run towards it.\"\n\nAt the age of 16, Beirne entered the University of Dublin (Trinity College) where he devised his own course of studies and received his Ph.D. at age 22. He held the prestigious Overseas Scholarship of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, before becoming a full-time member of the faculty of Trinity College in 1943, at the age of 25. He received an appointment as Senior Entomologist for the Canadian Government in Ottawa in 1949, and in 1955 was appointed director of the research of the Research Institute for Biological Control in Belleville, Ontario.\n\nIn 1967, he led seven of his scientific colleagues to Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia where they established the Pestology Centre, the first structured professional program leading to the then-novel degree of Master in Pest Management (MPM). At SFU Dr. Beirne also served as Dean of Graduate Studies and Emeritus Professor of Pest Management. After his retirement in 1983, he maintained close ties with the university and energetically involved himself in innovative business enterprises in pest control and in research on the histories of pest control in both Canada and Ireland. Dr. Beirne was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1944. He was the recipient of many honours and awards including the gold medal of the Entomological Society of Canada and the Career Achievement Award of the Science Council of British Columbia.. He lectured in more than 20 countries, published over 15 books and more than 120 scientific research papers. The insect genus Beirneola was named after him as were a number of insect species. He discovered and named more than 30 previously unknown species. His career accomplishments were great and provide on-going benefit. More important still was his positive influence on family, friends, students and colleagues.\n\nHe died in Burnaby, British Columbia in 1998.\n\nHe has been memorialised at Simon Fraser University with the \"B.P. Beirne Prize in Pest Management.\" He will be remembered by his clansmen for his book, \"The Family O'Beirne,\" published in 1997 and as the inspiration for \"The O'Beirne Family Journal,\" first published January 1998.\n\n\n"}

The company is owned by Kontoor Brands, a spin-off of VF Corporation's Jeans wear Division.\nIts headquarters is currently in Merriam, Kansas, just outside Kansas City, Missouri. The company states that they are an international retailer and manufacturer of casual wear and work wear and that they have more than 400 employees in the United States. In Australasia, the brand is owned by Pacific Brands since 2007, after it was acquired from Yakka.\n\nThe company was formed in 1889 by Henry David Lee as the HD Lee Mercantile Company at Salina, Kansas producing dungarees and jackets. The growth of Lee was prompted by the introduction of the Union-All work jumpsuit in 1913 and their first overall in 1920. Later in the 1920s Lee introduced a zipper fly and continued to expand. Around this time, the first children's overall line was sold. In 1928 H.D. Lee, founder and president of The H.D. Lee Mercantile Company, died. During the 1930s and 1940s the company became the leading manufacturer of work clothes in the US. In 1944, the Lazy \"S\" became the official Lee back pocket. A flood wiped out Lee's Kansas City distribution center. It ruined the entire stock of merchandise, except the Buddy Lee dolls, which floated. In 1954, Lee expanded into casual wear. During the 1960s the company expanded to 81 countries and in 1969 was acquired by VF Corporation, becoming a brand. Lee aired its first television advertisement, which promoted Lee western wear. In the 1970s Lee shifted its focus from the workwear business and began catering to fashion cycles. Lee created an all-new fit for women under the Ms. Lee label. A youth wear line for boys and girls was introduced. In 1996, the company launched Lee National Denim Day as part of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Working with the Entertainment Industry Foundation, Lee National Denim Day has raised over $75 million to help fund breast cancer research programs. In 2014, the brand was relaunched in Paris via the Citadium Paris store. In 2019, Lee, Wrangler, Rock & Republic, and VF Outlet were Separated from VF Corporation into Kontoor Brands.\n\nIn 1981, 240 factory workers in Greenock, Scotland, staged a sit-in in protest against plans to move the factory to Northern Ireland. What was planned as a one-night protest continued for 7 months. As of 2005, Lee Jeans have been manufactured by Arvind Mills in a number of small factories in Chamarajanagar, India. Around the world, about 60,000 workers produce 5,000 pairs of jeans a day.\n\nWithin the United States, the company spends more than $40 million per year on advertising. In 2009, Olson was appointed as the lead interactive agency for the American brand and redesigned their website. Barkley Inc. had previously handled interactive advertising for the brand.

It is a colorless liquid, although aged samples appear yellow. Although it belongs to the acid chlorides group of compounds, its synthesis and reactivity are somewhat different.\n\nAcryloyl chloride can be prepared by treating acrylic acid with acid chlorides, originally benzoyl chloride. Conventional one-pot chlorinating agents, e.g. thionyl chloride, phosphorus trichloride, are ineffective. Flow conditions allows use of a broadened range of chlorinating agents including oxalyl chloride and thionyl chloride. \n\nThis compound undergoes the reactions common for acid chlorides. For example, it reacts readily with water, producing acrylic acid. When treated with sodium salts of carboxylic acids, the anhydride is formed. Reactions with alcohols and amines gives esters and amides, respectively. \nAcryloyl chloride is most commonly employed for the introduction of acrylic groups into other compounds, e.g. the preparation of acrylate monomers and polymers.\n\n"}

He attended Phillips Academy, and Tulane University in New Orleans, where he received a B.A. degree in English. He also briefly attended University of California, Berkeley. In the early 1960s, Blank studied filmmaking at the University of Southern California and received his master's degree.\n\nFollowing his university education, he worked for a production company called Operation Success, making films that he would later describe as \"insipid films that promote business and industry.\" In 1967 he founded his own production company, Flower Films, with the release of \"God Respects Us When We Work, but Loves Us When We Dance\", a short colorful document of Los Angeles' Elysian Park Love-in. This was followed by \"The Blues Accordin' to Lightnin' Hopkins\" (1968) and \"The Sun's Gonna Shine\" (1968) about Houston blues musician Lightnin' Hopkins. He never went back to work making industrial films and all of his films were independently produced, often with the assistance of grants from cultural agencies, both governmental and non-governmental.\n\nMost of his films focused on American traditional music forms, including (among others) blues, Appalachian, Cajun, Creole, Tex-Mex, polka, tamburitza, and Hawaiian music. Many of these films represent the only filmed documents of musicians who are now deceased.\n\nBlank's films focusing on musical subjects often spent much of their running time focusing not on the music itself but on the music's cultural context, portraying the surroundings from which these American roots musics come.\n\nOther notable films on non-musical subjects include a film about garlic and another about gap-toothed women, as well as two films about German film director Werner Herzog: \"Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe\" (1980) and \"Burden of Dreams\" (1982), the latter about the filming of Herzog's \"Fitzcarraldo\". \"The Maestro: King of the Cowboy Artists\" (1994) and \"Sworn to the Drum: A Tribute to Francisco Aguabella\" (1995) were Blank's last two films using 16mm film. He later worked in digital video. His last film, \"All in This Tea\", which was co-directed by Gina Leibrecht, was a profile of the western Marin County-based tea importer and adventurer David Lee Hoffman. In 2007 Blank was awarded the prestigious Edward MacDowell Medal in the Arts.\n\nLes's son, Harrod Blank, has also become a documentary filmmaker.\n\nBlank lived in the Berkeley Hills and for more than 30 years he was a resident of Berkeley, which celebrated Les Blank Day on Jan 22, 2013. His company, Flower Films, was based in El Cerrito, Contra Costa County, California. Blank died of bladder cancer at his Berkeley Hills home on April 7, 2013.\n\nBlank was the first documentary filmmaker to earn the Edward MacDowell Medal in 2007, a national honor given to one artist a year. He was awarded in 1990 the American Film Institute's Maya Deren Award for outstanding lifetime achievement as an independent filmmaker. In 2011, the International Documentary Association honored Blank with a career achievement award.\n\nTwo months prior to Blank's death, the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival announced that Blank had been accepted to receive its 2013 Outstanding Achievement Award along with a retrospective of his work at the festival, which took place from April 25 to May 5, 2013.\n\nThe moving image collection of Les Blank is held at the Academy Film Archive.

Clark–Sheard is best known as the youngest member of the American gospel group The Clark Sisters. Clark–Sheard is also the mother of contemporary gospel singer and actress Kierra \"Kiki\" Sheard. She has released five solo albums, seventeen with The Clark Sisters and collaborated with her son J. Drew Sheard and her daughter Kierra Sheard.\n\nDuring the hiatus of the Clark Sisters, Clark–Sheard rose to fame after she recorded her critically acclaimed and much anticipated solo album \"Finally Karen\", which spawned her hit, \"Balm in Gilead\" (a re-recording of a song she originally recorded as part of The Clark Sisters back in the 1980s for their \"Heart & Soul\" album) the R&B-flavored \"Just For Me\" and \"Nothing Without You\" – a contemporary duet with R&B diva Faith Evans. \"Finally Karen\" became one of the most successful gospel albums of 1998 earning Sheard a Grammy nomination and earning her a Soul Train Lady of Soul Award for \"Best Female Vocalist\"\n\nAfter her debut album success and much touring, Clark–Sheard was hospitalized in 2001 after one of her blood vessels burst during a minor surgery, resulting in doctors giving her a 2% chance of survival. Her testimony inspired the title name for her long-awaited sophomore project, \"2nd Chance\" released in 2002, featuring \"A Secret Place\" – which is now considered a classic amongst fans. Clark–Sheard recorded two more live albums, including \"The Heavens Are Telling\" and \"It's Not Over\" (which featured some studio recordings), before releasing \"All in One\", Clark–Sheard's first all-studio-recorded album in 13 years. The album debuted at #3 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Gospel Chart and #98 on \"Billboard\"'s Top 200 albums chart, while its first single \"Prayed Up\" has so far peaked at #10 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Gospel Songs chart.\n\nSingers Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Faith Evans, Coko of SWV, Jovan Lacroix, Blu Cantrell, Lil' Mo, Missy Elliott, and Fantasia all count Clark-Sheard as one of their vocal influences.\nClark–Sheard was born Karen Valencia Clark on November 15, 1960 in Detroit, Michigan, the youngest child of Reverend Elbert Clark and Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, a pioneering gospel choral director. The youngest of six children, Clark–Sheard's siblings are Leo, Jacky, Denise, Elbernita \"Twinkie\" and Dorinda. Clark–Sheard began singing gospel with her sisters at age 6 in what became known as The Clark Sisters. For high school, Clark-Sheard attended Mumford High School in Detroit, Michigan; graduating in 1979.\n\nClark–Sheard's involvement in the Island Inspirational All Stars' \"Don't Give Up\" in 1996 (along with Donald Lawrence, Hezekiah Walker, and Kirk Franklin) led to her signing with Island Records. Clark–Sheard's solo career began with the release of her debut album \"Finally Karen\" in 1997. The album, consisting of half studio recordings and half live recordings, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album in 1998, won Clark-Sheard the Lady of Soul award for Best Gospel Album that same year and peaked at #28 and #2 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and U.S. \"Billboard\" Gospel Albums charts respectively.\n\nAfter Yolanda Adams, Clark-Sheard became the 2nd gospel artist to sign to Elektra Records. She released her Elektra debut album \"2nd Chance\" in 2002 (so named because of the \"second chance\" she was given by God after her near-death experience – which is referenced in her daughter Kierra's song \"You Don't Know\"). The album was led off by the single \"Be Sure\" and though Clark–Sheard was in excellent form vocally, the slick, progressive sound of the disc was not received well in the gospel community. However, the album still performed well commercially and critically reaching #82 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200, #27 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart (her highest chartings on those charts to date) and #2 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Gospel Albums.\n\nThe 2003 followup \"The Heavens Are Telling\" fared well, but came at an awkward time when Elektra Records was being dissolved into Atlantic Records and so failed to match the commercial success of Clark-Sheard's previous albums, peaking a whole 106 places below \"2nd Chance\" at #188 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 – though it managed to reach a respectable #44 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, a high #3 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Gospel Albums chart and was her first album to chart on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Christian Albums chart, where it peaked at #11.\n\nIn 2005, after a bidding war with several labels, Clark-Sheard finally signed with Word Records and issued \"It's Not Over\", (Originally titled \"Finally Karen Returns\"), the sequel to her 1997 debut album \"Finally Karen\" was set to be released November 15, 2005, Clark-Sheard's 45th birthday, but was delayed and released the following year. Most of \"It's Not Over\" was recorded live in 2005 at Karen's home church in Detroit, Michigan while the last three tracks were studio-recorded. \n\nIt was Clark-Sheard's first solo album not to feature guest vocals from her daughter (Kierra Sheard) and was the first to include production from Israel Houghton – who handled the majority of the project. Despite having a much grander sound than her previous albums, it was another critical success for Karen and charted modestly at #124 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 and #4 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. As the songwriter, on February 10, 2008, Clark-Sheard won the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Song for \"Blessed & Highly Favored\" sung by The Clark Sisters.\n\nIn early 2009, Clark-Sheard and her husband, J.Drew Sheard partnered together and launched a new record label entitled Karew Records (Karew being a combination of both their forenames: Karen & Drew, pronounced: Kuh-rue); Distribution is via EMI Gospel. The Clark Sisters' Christmas album – which was released in October 2009 – was the first project to be released from Karew Records.\n\nOn January 31, 2010, Clark-Sheard won the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance for \"Wait on the Lord\" which she was featured with Donnie McClurkin. On April 6, 2010, Clark-Sheard released her fifth album (and first on her newly founded own record label – Karew Records) titled \"All in One\", which features additional vocals from her daughter Kierra Sheard, son J. Drew Sheard II, sister Dorinda Clark Cole, niece Angel Chisholm and cousin J. Moss. Though her first all-studio-recorded album since her 2002 release \"2nd Chance\", \"All in One\" managed to debut and peak at #98 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 (her second highest charting on that chart to date) and #3 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Gospel Albums chart, while the album's lead single – \"Prayed Up\" – peaked at #9 and stayed over 22 weeks on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot Gospel Songs chart. Clark-Sheard released her latest single \"Sunday A.M\" in 2014, which is nominated for the Best Gospel Song in the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nAs of 2019, Clark-Sheard is in talks to play Kitty Parham, a member of The Famous Ward Singers in Aretha Franklin's upcoming biopic \"Respect\".\n\nKaren was portrayed by her daughter, Kierra Sheard in the Lifetime TV biopic The Clark Sisters: First Ladies of Gospel, released April 11, 2020.\n\nClark-Sheard has been married once and has two children. On June 16, 1984, Clark-Sheard married Bishop J. Drew Sheard, a Detroit-based minister. Her husband is senior pastor of Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ in Detroit.

Kiki is also a gospel recording artist, with four albums, plus various projects to her credit. J. Drew is a musician and producer. He has a son named Jacob Dillon Sheard and daughter named Kali Drew Sheard.\nIn 2001, Clark-Sheard was faced with a life-threatening crisis when a blood vessel burst during a scheduled bariatric surgery. Her doctors only gave her a 2% chance of survival due to her complications. After the blood clot was surgically removed, Clark-Sheard fell into a coma.

{"id": "2318600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318600", "title": "Wonderful Parliament", "text": "Wonderful Parliament\n\nThe Wonderful Parliament was an English parliamentary session held in October to November 1386 which pressed for reforms of King Richard II's administration. The King had become increasingly unpopular in the preceding years due in the main to perceived extravagance to his favourites and the unsuccessful prosecution of the ongoing war in France. Further, there was a well-grounded fear that the King of France was poised to invade England, as he had been gathering a fleet in Flanders for much of the year. Discontent with Richard II climaxed when the King requested a then-unprecedented sum with which to invade France himself. Instead of granting the King's request as he must have expected, the two Houses of the Lords and Commons effectively united against him and his unpopular Chancellor, Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk. They saw de la Pole as both a favourite who had benefited—unfairly—from the King's unwarranted largesse, and the minister responsible for the King's failures. They demanded the Earl's impeachment.\n\nThe King at first refused to attend the parliament; he in fact attempted to dissolve the sitting, to no avail. Richard requested Parliament send a delegation to negotiate with him at Eltham Palace; they, fearing an ambush, sent two Lords instead. One of them, the Duke of Gloucester (Richard's uncle) proceeded to threaten Richard with deposition until the King agreed to return to Westminster and do parliament's bidding. He was forced to sack his unpopular minister and was only allowed to appoint a royal council that was vetted by the Lords and Commons. The King was immensely angry at what he perceived to be an unnatural restriction on his natural right to receive his choice of counsel and appoint his own ministers, and soon left London. He spent much of the following year gathering support in the regions, ignoring his parliament-imposed council, and taking legal advice as to how to overthrow the restraints that constrained his rule. During this time de la Pole was returned to royal favour. Although the King managed to overturn most of the restrictions the Wonderful Parliament placed upon him, within a few years the crisis had resurged, even worse than in 1386, resulting in armed conflict between Crown and nobility, and, eventually, de la Pole's exile and death.\n\nFor the previous three years, Richard II had been growing in unpopularity. He was increasingly seen as distributing patronage (\"lavish to the point of foolishness,\" states one biographer) to royal favourites, rather than using the funds he had available to him to the benefit of the common weal. At the same time, parliament was increasingly coming to the view that the King needed to rule as economically as was possible; against this, they saw, they believed, not only friends of the King receiving extravagant patronage, but even his own ministers—specifically, Suffolk. Furthermore, the Hundred Years' War had been restarted by the French in the last years of the reign of King Edward III until an uneasy peace with the Treaty of Bruges in 1375 (an \"abject and costly failure\"). War had broken out again a couple of years later. By the accession of Richard II in 1377, there had been few expeditions to France to defend English territories, and those that had been launched were military and political failures (for example, the Bishop of Norwich's expedition in 1383). Yet in the meantime, parliament faced requests from the King for increased subsidies to pay for these assaults, regardless of their lack of strategic success. The King and his advisers, therefore, were increasingly unpopular, and one of those advisers—Michael de la Pole, the Chancellor—became even more disliked due to his influence on foreign policy. De la Pole has been described as a \"staunch loyalist,\" and Richard had elevated him to the peerage as Earl of Suffolk only the previous year. Suffolk advocated making peace overtures to the French, which, although (as historians have noted with hindsight) was most likely the sensible strategy at the time, was unpopular with much of the English nobility, some of whom probably still expected a martial career as their fathers had enjoyed, with the financial and chivalric benefits it could bring the successful. Indeed, some, it has been said—such as the Earls of Arundel and Warwick—had \"been kept in good humour since 1376 only by a lavish distribution of Crown perquisites and war salaries.\"\n\nHowever, as Anthony Tuck has said, subsequent royal \"policy of \"rapprochement\" with France made little headway.\" In fact, it may, combined with his uncle John of Gaunt's 1385 invasion of Castile, have provoked the planned French invasion of England of 1386. On top of this, France had just renewed the 'Auld Alliance' with Scotland, by which the former promised the latter an Expeditionary Force and 40,000 gold florins. The absent Gaunt could use neither his wealth nor his retinue in defence of his nephew the King when the attacks of the Wonderful Parliament came. Either way, the war with France, such as it was, was the immediate cause of the parliament as it was not only exorbitantly expensive, but had no military successes to show for the expense. For Richard, too, as Roskell put it, it also had the result of creating an \"adversely critical attitude towards the government\" that reflected (poorly) upon the King.\n\nThe King urgently needed funds to defend both the border with Scotland and the kingdom itself from both Scottish border raids and a French invasion, and the absence of Gaunt probably added to the sense of panic. It is also possible that Richard took advantage of Gaunt's absence to advance some of his favoured courtiers further up the peerage.\n\nThe previous parliament of October 1385 had attempted to force a commission upon the King in an effort to reform his Royal Household and especially its expenditure. This commission not only criticised the King's distribution of patronage, but also prevented him from elevating his choice of men to the ranks of the upper nobility. However, this commission and its advice to take more judicious counselling appears to have been ignored by Richard. Combined with a series of external events beyond the government's control, by the time the 'Wonderful Parliament' sat—the following October—\"an atmosphere of political crisis\" was apparent to all. No successes had been achieved since the previous parliament (for instance, a victory over the Scots would have diverted some negative attention from the King's finances and patronage), so by 1386, \"the Commons had no good reason to overlook the excessive generosity of the King or to acquiesce in his government's arbitrary taxation\" as Palmer put it. Most of the critical elements of the 1386 parliament had already been touched on in the previous one; little had been done, however, to resolve them by either King or Chancellor, and when the 1386 parliament convened it \"nursed a number of very substantial grievances.\"\n\nDomestically, there was a financial crisis, which was blamed on Suffolk and the King's perceived extravagance. The biggest external threat influencing political decision making at this time was the threat of imminent French invasion. King Charles VI of France had, after six years of siege, finally taken Ghent and crushed its revolt. He soon turned his eye to England, and from March 1386 he gathered a large invasion fleet at Sluys, and by September it was reckoned in England to be on the verge of sailing. The King summoned the royal council to Osney Abbey, in Oxfordshire on 8 October. and it was there decided to summon parliament. As a result, writs of summons were issued to the Lords Spiritual and Lords Temporal (including Richard's newly elevated favourites), as well as nearly 300 commoners. In the meantime an army of 10,000 men had been gathered to surround London and protect it from the expected invasion, and it was that invasion, and the concomitant necessity for urgent funds, that provided the main reason for parliament being called.\n\nParliament opened on 1 October 1386, with a notably small number of ecclesiasts attending. Those that did—such as Bishop Courtenay, brother of one of Richard's most outspoken critics—were probably regarded by the King as partisan—against him. The Chancellor, de la Pole made the opening speech as was customary; it would be the last occasion on which he would do so. In his speech he claimed that it had been decided in Oxfordshire that the King would personally lead a foreign expedition to defend his claim to the French throne and prosecute the war with France with increased vigour. No sooner had the Chancellor finished his address than the Commons themselves came before the King in the House of Lords.\n\nThe opening—and for the King, most important—business on the parliamentary agenda was a subsidy of four fifteenths and two tenths—the then massive sum of about £155,000. \"Never before had such a sum been demanded, and it was this that precipitated Suffolk's fall. There was an immediate—and concerted—assault by the Commons and the Lords, who were of \"with one mind\" and \"complaining grievously.\" The Commons represented public opinion (which, explains May McKisack, \"demanded a scapegoat\") and with the Lords (composed of such powerful men as the Earls of Warwick and Arundel, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishops of Winchester and Exeter), would have, it has been said, \"presented a formidable opposition to a boy of nineteen,\" as the King was. The precise political manoeuvrings of the various parties are now obscured, but no royal business was transacted. At some point the discussions moved from the question of tax to that of the King's Chancellor. However it came about, it certainly resulted in the King making a spirited defence of his right to choose his own ministers and the royal prerogative. The Commons also demanded that the King appoint his councillors in parliament.\n\nEven so, Richard did eventually agree to dismiss Michael de la Pole. Also dismissed alongside de la Pole was the Bishop of Durham (the Treasurer) and Walter Skirlaw (Keeper of the Privy Seal). Their successors took office immediately.\n\nIt is possible that the original plan was to Impeach de Vere, who was felt to have at least as much influence with the King as Suffolk, if not more. However, the fact that the attack was eventually launched on the Chancellor is probably down to the simple fact that he was more parvenu and thus, of the two, the easier target. Whatever the original tactics, the plan that was finally acted upon was to impeach de la Pole, and thus to attack the King indirectly; but the articles of impeachment had been sloppily prepared (in fact, it was only the second time in its history that parliament had attempted to impeach anyone). This is not to say that the articles were \"frivolous, trivial or paltry.\" But even so, as a result, the most general charges were unprovable. Others (for example, the conduct of the war with France) were shown to be the joint responsibility of the royal council, and so not solely Suffolk's fault. A recent verdict upon the claims against Suffolk suggests that they were \"trivial or unfounded... merely pretexts for dismissing the chief minister of an unpopular King.\" Even so, the parliament itself became increasingly focused on personally attacking the Earl and the perceived abuse of the authority of the chancellorship, even down to the supposed theft of a charter from Dover Castle. The affair ended up \"dragg[ing] on for at least a month [and] degenerated into three badly sustained and trivial charges, behind each of which motives of malice or private interest may be suspected,\" one commentator has written. De la Pole's main defence was two-pronged: on the one hand, he accused his accusers of expecting a higher morality from him than from the King's other advisers, and on the other hand, that he could not be held solely responsible for what were collective decisions. \n\nKing Richard had not attended the parliament in person, having retired—possibly in anger—to the royal palace at Eltham, and he refused to obey its demands for impeachment. According to one contemporary chronicler, he declared he would not get rid of a kitchen scullion on the grounds that parliament asked him to. According to the author of another chronicle, the \"Eulogium Historiarum\", he even tried to dissolve parliament at this point, but the Commons refused to leave.\n\nThe Commons reported to the King that they could achieve little without his presence in parliament, so Richard sent for a deputation of forty of them to finalise discussions at Eltham. However, the St Albans Chronicler, Thomas Walsingham, reports that the King was planning on having the parliamentary group arrested or even ambushed and killed, and that, more to the point, the Mayor of London, Sir Nicholas Exton had discovered the plan and warned them. This is the event described by Henry Knighton as the \"occultus rumor\" in which the King invited forty members of that parliament to a dinner—and then dispose of them. This may well have merely been a rumour, as Knighton suggests—perhaps reflecting the extent to which the King's reputation had declined—but parliament was taking no chances: they sent the King's uncle, the Duke of Gloucester and the Bishop of Ely in their stead. \n\nThe Lords spoke \"eloquently, if fictitiously\" to the King, on how they perceived his duty and Gloucester appears ultimately to have made a threat of deposition against Richard (under 'ancient law' which dictated that, without a King's presence in an annual parliament, the Commons could go home, facing no punishment for leaving parliamentary business unfinished—in this case, Richard's war tax). The \"Eulogium Historiarum\" chronicler alleged that Richard even threatened to appeal to the King of France for aid against his domestic enemies, until the Duke and the Bishop pointed out that the King of France himself was England's greatest enemy. The same chronicle relates how, in parliament, the Lords sent for \"the statute by which Edward [II] had been adjudged\" and that it was as a result of this manoeuvre that the King became melancholic, and agreed to return to parliament and accept the Commons' petitions. The King eventually dismissed de la Pole as Chancellor on 23 October, and appointed the Bishop of Ely the next day. In what may have been intentional or just \"a masterly piece of bad timing\" and \"extraordinarily ill-judged,\" he had promoted his favourite, Robert de Vere from Earl of Oxford to Marquess of Dublin on 13 October. This, says one historian, enraged people all the more.\n\nThe Parliament is highly important in the context of later events, and has been described as \"the worst political crisis of the reign to date\" and a direct assault on the traditional principle that medieval kings governed by personal prerogative. It marks the first stage in an ongoing power struggle between the King and a set of magnates who became known as the Lords Appellant. On 19 November, Richard appointed his councillors in parliament as the Commons had requested; this was described as a \"great and continual council,\" composed of eleven peers and three principal officials. They included the Archbishops of York and Canterbury, the Bishops Wickham and Brantingham, Abbot Morice of Waltham Abbey, the Dukes of York and Gloucester, the Earl of Arundel, and Lords Cobham, Scrope and Devereaux. However, Richard was also able to limit their terms of office to a year only, as well as to ensure that the majority of the members were men who already had a history of loyalty to him. This amounted to a concession from parliament; further, except for the Duke of Gloucester and the Earl of Arundel, none of the future Appellants who were to do so much harm to the King and his reign, were appointed. The Commons did not appear to believe the King to be sufficiently restrained by these measures, though, and proceeded to call for further concessions from the Crown.\n\nAlmost immediately parliament had concluded, Richard denounced the appointed council, and made it clear he would consult it only when absolutely necessary and preferably not at all. Following his impeachment, de la Pole had had his royal grants of land reversed (although he retained his earldom), and was sentenced to be imprisoned, probably in Corfe Castle. The King soon overturned these judgments; not only was de la Pole soon set free, but he joined the King for the Christmas festivities at Windsor later that year, where Richard treated him with \"ostentatious warmth.\" In New Year 1387, the King left London for a prolonged period (on what has been known as his \"gyration\" around the country), The word \"gyrare\" is used by the contemporary chronicler Henry Knighton, the at-least partial goal of which was to gather together and consolidate his supporters. Not only did Richard ignore the parliament-imposed council, but, whilst he was out of London, he even held councils of his own. Since the royal commission was unable to follow him everywhere, this had the effect of removing the royal household from their oversight. \n\nBy August 1387, Richard was in Shrewsbury, where he summoned the royal justices. Presenting a number of 'Questions for the judges', as they have been called, to them, Richard intended establishing once and for all the parameters and extents of the liberties and prerogatives of the Crown. More, he wanted an explicit condemnation of those he held responsible as traitors, and a ruling that, therefore, they should die as traitors. Most importantly, he intended to establish whether the law passed imposing his unwanted council was \"derogatory... to the lord King.\" The King clearly intended, despite the constraints parliament had set on his authority, to regain his previous political pre-eminence. The judges, at least, gave him the answers he required; Michael de la Pole was personally involved in both drawing up the questions for the judges and subsequently attesting to them. According to one contemporary, he was personally responsible for threatening the Chief Justice with execution if he refused to seal the document. Further encouragement to the King's campaign was provided around this time, when Archbishop Neville resigned from the parliamentary council and re-pledged his allegiance to Richard II, and by August 1387, de la Pole had returned to his position as the King's closest adviser, entering London with the Richard on the King's return to the capital in November 1387.\n\nThe 'Wonderful Parliament' has been described as setting \"the political stage for the rest of Richard's reign\" and the first outright conflict between the King and his magnates. Also the King's first political defeat; it was not to be the last. Richard's defiant response to the parliament, and attempts to convict its promoters of treason, ultimately led to the Battle of Radcot Bridge and the Merciless Parliament of 1388. One twentieth-century historian has commented that \"it is generally recognised that all the constitutional and political troubles of Richard II's reign can be traced back to the Wonderful parliament.\" This includes the subsequent military attack by the Lords Appellant on Robert de Vere and those of Richard on the Appellants; although the court party was swept from power in 1386—when, as J. S. Roskell put it, \"the exercise of royal authority was virtually handed over to a parliamentary commission\"—Richard II had a \"violent reaction\" to the proceedings. Roskell also suggests that the affair was not so much an argument about who should rule, King or parliament, as the answer to that being anything other than the King would have been anachronistic. Rather, it was regarding whose attitude towards parliament would prevail: the King, who saw parliament as being a tool of royal authority, or parliament, who saw themselves as conciliar to the King.\n\nAlthough the epithet 'wonderful' is often applied to this parliament (stemming from the use of the Latin \"mirabilis\" by a contemporary chronicler to describe it), it actually applied to the later—and more bloody—1388 assembly. Although the parliament of 1386 was described by a later contemporary as having \"wrought wonders,\" modern historians have been more critical. One has noted the \"inanity of the proceedings and the vindictiveness that motivated them, the weakness of the King's government and the inability of anyone to do anything about it.\"\n\nOne member of the 'Wonderful Parliament,' the M.P. for Kent, was Geoffrey Chaucer, already a well-known poet. Although his personal position regarding later events is unknown, it has been suggested that he used the experience of this and the later Merciless Parliament (which he was also elected to attend) as a basis for his work \"The Parliament of Foules\". His attendance has also been attributed to influencing the Trojan Court scene in his later epic poem, \"Troilus and Criseyde\", in which it is the assembled parliament, rather than the King or the Trojan princes, that is responsible for the subsequent political calamity. Recent commentators have suggested that it shows how Chaucer was \"astounded at the vindictiveness of some of [the King's] political adversaries.\" This work is a more cynical treatment of parliamentary affairs than his previous \"Parliament of Foules\". Indeed, Chaucer was probably personally affected by the goings-on of the parliament and particularly its bloody consequences, it has been argued, as he was not only a royal appointee to his post of London customs' controller, but also a personal friend to some of those under attack.\n\n"}

His method, exemplary of a \"golden age\" of Sufi metaphysics, was related to the Illuminationism of Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi as well as to Rumi's Shams Tabrizi. Kubra was born in 540/1145 and died in 618/1221.\n\nBorn in 540/1145 in Konye-Urgench, Najmuddin Kubra began his career as a scholar of hadith and kalam. His interest in Sufism began in Egypt where he became a murid of Ruzbihan Baqli, who was an initiate of the Uwaisi. After years of study, he abandoned his exploration of the religious sciences and devoted himself entirely to the Sufi way of life.\n\nSufi sheikh Zia al-Din-'Ammar Bitlisi was Kubra's teacher, who tried to present Sufi thought in a new way to provide contemplation and influence for the reader. After receiving his khirka, Kubra gained a large following of gnostics and writers on Sufism.\n\nBecause his followers were predominantly Sufi writers and gnostics, Kubra was given the title \"manufacturer of saints\" (in Persian: \"vali tarash\") and his order was named the Kubrawiya.\n\nKubra's main body of works concerns the analysis of the visionary experience. He wrote numerous important works discussing the visionary experience, including a Sufi commentary on the Quran that he was unable to complete due to his death in 618/1221. Kubra died during the Mongol invasion and massacre after refusing to leave his city, where he fought in hand-to-hand combat against the Mongols.\n\nOverall, Kubra is remembered as a pioneer of the Sufi tradition and explanation of spiritual visionary experiences. Kubra's work spread throughout the Middle East and Central Asia where it flourished for many years, until it gradually was taken over by other similar more popular ideologies and Sufi leaders.\n\nIn addition to his work centering on the Sufi commentary of the Qu'ran, Kubra wrote other important treatises including:\n\n\nHis works discuss the analysis of dreams and visions, such as the \"significance of dreams and visions, the degrees of luminous epiphany that are manifested to the mystic, the different classes of concept and image that engage his attention, and the nature and interrelations of man's 'subtle centres.'\" The interpretation and understanding of dreams was important because Muhammad had developed the Islamic faith based on dreams and visions, so the Qu'ran was seen as a visionary text. The Kubrawiya order were avid practitioners of seeking the meaning of visions through ritual performances and meditation. Kubra, being the manufacturer of saints, led him to analyze popular dream episodes from Muslim hagiographical works, and his disciples would follow in his analysis of these well known and important works.\n\nThe Kubrawiya was Kubra's Sufi order, focusing on explaining the visionary experience. The influence of the Kubrawiya can be seen on the Islamic world as a whole because of its relationship to the strong influence of Shi'ism in Iran. The Kubrawiya was not largely popular until after Kubra's death in the 13th century. The Kubrawiya found great development outside of Central Asia, but its influence and presence only lasted till the 15th/16th century, when it was overshadowed by the Naqshbandiya (another, more attractive Sufi group) during the Ottoman Empire, though a nominal following continued on. Before this occurred, the order split after the leadership of Isḥāḳ al-Khuttalānī (d. 1423) into the Nurbakshiyya and the Dhahabiyya. The former were eventually persecuted under the Safavids in the later 16th century, whereas the latter survives presently with Shiraz as its centre.\n\nThe Kubrawiya's influence in Central Asia established many political, social, and economic activities there, but the Naqshbandiyah developed these ideas to their fullest potential. The Kubrawiya's main teaching was a \"well-developed mystical psychology based on the analysis of the visionary experience.\" They focused on explaining the spiritual visionary experiences that Sufis underwent in everyday life. Their largest concern was the total focus on the zikr as a means of allowing for the perception of spiritual visions.\n\nThe Firdausi Kubrawi order was popularized in Bihar and Bengal region of India by Makhdoom Sharfuddin Ahmed Yahya Maneri Hashmi who is buried in Biharsharif. The branch Firdausia's linage from Najmuddin Kubra is through his disciple Saif ed-Din al-Boharsi through Sheikh Badruddin Samarqandi through Sheikh Ruknuddin Firdausi through Sheikh Najeeduddin Firdausi of Mehrauli, Delhi, who was Makhdoom Sheikh Sharafuddin Ahmad Yahya Maneri Hashmi's peer.\n\nAmong his twelve students one can mention Najmeddin Razi, Sayfeddin Bakhezri, Majd al-Dīn Baghdādī, Ali ibn lala ghznavi and Baha'uddin Walad, father of Jalaluddin Rumi. However, one of his most well-known and influential disciples though was Sa'd al-Din Hamuwayi. Kubra informed Hamuwayi to leave the city in which they resided with the impending Mongol invasion on the horizon. However, Hamuwayi stayed with Kubra and received his ijaza from him, which shows his favorable reputation with the Sufi Master, as not only a student, but as a friend. Hamuwayi wrote over thirty important manuscripts and other works concerning the work of Kubra, and the influence of the Kubrawiyah.\n\nToday, the practices of the Kubrawiyya are similar to certain yoga practices (Tibetan and other sadhana), wherein the practitioners focus on prayer, fasting, seclusion, and entry into visionary states. Although the focus on visionary states can lead to infer that the practice of yoga could be attributed to the influence of the Kubrawiyah, and although mutual influences have taken place between sufism and indian yoga practice, there is no evidence of a direct influence of Kubrawiyya on Hatha Yoga which is contemporary (tenth to eleventh century CE). Experience of visions and colours which are systematically studied by Kubra, have close counterparts in yoga treatises (Hatha yoga pradipika, Gheranda Samhita, etc). Kubra said \"the mystical traveller will similarly sense the generation of lights from the whole of his body and the veil will possibly be withdrawn from the entire selfhood, so that with all of the body you will see the All!\" The physical action of yoga will help one to see the All (God) through dreams, visions, and experiences. In a modern attempt to explain the connection of the divine through yoga, they attribute another quote of Kubra saying \"The light that is derived from God's lights and witnessed by the heart serves to make God known to the heart: He makes Himself known by means of Himself.\" These two groups show similar spiritual experiences such as total isolation which invokes a connection with the divine seen in accounts by both parties. Even though, there are numerous similarities between the mystical experiences achieved through yoga and those achieved by various sufi practices, it is not a fact that connection between these two groups can be attributed to the spread of the Kubrawiyah's ideologies in the 15th century, but rather that mutual influences have taken place via Kashmir and other northern parts of India, and via Bengal where the two - sufism and hinduist yoga - are proven to have been in contact, and still are influencing each other today (cf th Baul movement).\n\n"}

It is roughly divided as follows:\n\nIn addition, the discipline examines German under various aspects: the way it is spoken and written, i.e., spelling; declination; vocabulary; sentence structure; texts; etc. It compares the various manifestations such as social groupings (slang, written texts, etc.) and geographical groupings (dialects, etc.).\n\nThe study of German literature is divided into two parts: \"Ältere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft\" deals with the period from the beginnings of German in the early Middle Ages up to post-Medieval times around AD 1750, while the modern era is covered by \"Neuere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft\". The field systematically examines German literature in terms of genre, form, content, and motifs as well as looking at it historically by author and epoch. Important areas include edition philology, history of literature, and textual interpretation. The relationships of German literature to the literatures of other languages (e.g. reception and mutual influences) and historical contexts are also important areas of concentration. \"The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory: Fourth Edition\" () is printed in English but contains many German-language literary terms that apply cross-culturally in the field of literary criticism; quite a few of the in terms in the book originated in German but have since been adopted by English-language critics and scholars.\n\nAt least in Germany and Austria, German studies in academia play a central role in the education of German school teachers. Their courses usually cover four fields:\nSeveral universities offer specialized curricula for school teachers, usually called \"'\". In Germany, they are leading to a two step exam and certificate by the federal states of Germany cultural authorities, called the ' (\"state exam\").\n\nIn recent years, German has looked for links with the fields of communications, cultural studies and media studies. In addition, the sub-branch of film studies has established itself.\n\nAs an unsystematic field of interest for individual scholars, German studies can be traced back to Tacitus' \"Germania\". The publication and study of legal and historical source material, such as Medieval Bible translations, were all undertaken during the German Renaissance of the sixteenth century, truly initiating the field of German studies. As an independent university subject, German studies was introduced at the beginning of the nineteenth century by Georg Friedrich Benecke, the Brothers Grimm, and Karl Lachmann.\n\n\n\n\n\"German studies\" is taught at many German universities. Some examples are:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He may have left Arkansas for Texas in 1829, when he transferred land to a Charlton Thompson in Lovely County, Arkansas, in what is now Oklahoma. When he settled in Harrison County, Texas in 1838 he received a first-class certificate grant, which were only issued to married men who were in Texas when the Texas Declaration of Independence was ratified, indicating he was in Texas before March 2, 1836.\n\nIn 1841 a new seat was sought for Harrison County, and Whetstone offered some of his land in central Harrison County to build a church and a school on, and to subsequently divide the remainder into 190 lots. Commissioners were initially concerned that the water in the area would not be good. The reason for moving the county seat from a site on the Sabine River like Pulaski was that it had poor water and was prone to disease and flooding. Whetstone supposedly convinced the commissioners that the water was good by pulling a jug of whiskey out from a hollow in an oak tree in what is now downtown Marshall. He passed around the jug, and convinced the commissioners to build on the site; either by convincing them that the whiskey (and water) were good, getting them drunk, or both. Some historians view this account as embellished or untrue.\n\nDespite being credited with the founding of Marshall, Whetstone's friend Isaac Van Zandt laid out the city and named it in honor of John Marshall. \n\nWhetstone soon became entangled in the Regulator–Moderator War as a Moderator. He supposedly killed over twenty people, and was described in his obituary as a \"noted freebooter who for many years has been an object of terror and hatred on the eastern frontier of Texas\". \n\nIn November 1843, Whetstone was shot and killed by a Regulator, Col. William T. Boulware, on Marshall's city square, later named Whetstone Square. His estate remained unsettled by his widow Dicey for some years after his death. Whetstone's grave is unmarked, although he is traditionally believed to be buried at a site off what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard.\n\nIronically, Whetstone, who was illiterate, is often attributed with establishing Marshall as an educational center by helping to finance early schools and academies.\n"}

Awards include the 1984 Penguin Award for best actor, 1995 Green Room Award for outstanding fringe performer and a nomination for the 1998 AFI Award for best actor in a leading role in a television drama.\n\nConnor also played guest roles in Australian soap operas: He played a guest role of Kevin, husband of Cheryll (Lisa Aldenhoven), in the women's prison drama serial \"Prisoner\". Then in 1986 he returned to the series in the recurring role of biker Bongo Connors. Connor had a brief role as another biker, Angel, in \"Sons and Daughters\" in 1986.\n\nHe appeared in the USA television miniseries \"Moby Dick\" as Flask.\n\nIn July 1999, Connor began filming the ongoing role of builder and family patriarch Joe Scully in the television soap opera \"Neighbours\", with his first scene's going on air in October. The show's producers invited him to audition for the role, and he decided to accept when he found out that he would be working with actress Janet Andrewartha, who plays Joe's on-screen wife Lyn Scully. Connor had previously played a guest role in the series as character Phil Hoffman debuting on-screen in \"Episode 1410\" on 26th March and appearing until 16th April, 1991. Joe Scully gave Connor the chance to play a character who was not a \"bad guy, a confrontational type, a man on the verge\". Connor was initially contracted with \"Neighbours\" for three years, with 12-month renewal options.\n\nConnor was fired from the series in September 2003, several months after receiving a written warning from producers and overcoming an amphetamine habit. There had been ongoing hostility between him and Andrewartha; who had been the source of the vast majority of complaints about him. He sued the show's producer, Grundy Television, for wrongful termination of his contract, seeking about $200,000.\n\nThe court hearing heard that he had an amphetamine drug habit while performing on the show. Connor's older brother died in June 2001 and he had been badly affected by this, leading to the drug habit. Members of the cast and crew had complained about his behaviour at work. This included alleged aggressive behaviour and lateness that delayed production. After being confronted about his problem he met with the cast in May 2003 and admitted the problem and apologised.\n\nConnor won the case and was awarded by the Supreme Court of Victoria over $230,000 in libel damages.\n\nConnor worked in the United Kingdom in pantomime.

Employing 50 'operatives' on 1500 spindles and 25 looms, the mill was incorporated by local planter Christian Breithaupt in 1833, with later investors George McDuffie, John Bauskett, and William Gregg. Gregg found it under-capitalized and too small for economic survival, producing an unmanageable variety of products, and suffering due to a lack of active management. As such it served Gregg as a training ground for his successful Graniteville project of 1847.\n\nGregg observed 'the most indifferent overseer's house in Lowell, Massachusetts, at least such as I saw, cost more than the whole village of Vaucluse, containing upwards of 200 inhabitants including a comfortable dwelling recently built as a residence for one of its owners'.

While its original version was related to Intel's DVI video stream format, a hardware-only codec for the compression of television-quality video onto compact discs, Indeo was distinguished by being one of the first codecs allowing full-speed video playback without using hardware acceleration. Also unlike Cinepak and TrueMotion S, the compression used the same Y'CbCr 4:2:0 colorspace as the ITU's H.261 and ISO's MPEG-1.\nIndeo use was free of charge to allow for broadest usage.\n\nDuring the development of what became the P5 Pentium microprocessor, the Intel Architecture Labs implemented one of the first, and at the time highest-quality, software-only video codecs, which was marketed as \"Indeo Video\". It has been developed since the 1980s based on the hardware-only Digital Video Interactive (DVI) which was previously developed by General Electric. Indeo was first released in 1992 along with Microsoft's Video for Windows platform. At its public introduction, it was the only video codec supported in both the Microsoft (Video for Windows) and Apple Computer's QuickTime software environments, as well as by IBM's software systems of the day. It was sold to Ligos Corporation in 2000.\n\nIntel produced several different versions of the codec between 1993 and 2000, based on very different underlying mathematics and having different features.\n\nThough Indeo saw significant usage in the mid-1990s, it remained proprietary. Intel slowed development and stopped active marketing, and it was quickly surpassed in popularity by the rise of MPEG codecs and others, as processors became more powerful and its optimization for Intel's chips less important. Indeo still saw some use in video game cutscene videos, such as in 1998's \"\".\n\nThe original format was designed for real-time playback on low-end Intel CPUs (i386 and i486), optionally supported by specialized decoder hardware (Intel i750). Decoding complexity was significantly lower than with contemporary MPEG codecs (H.261, MPEG-1 Part 2).\n\nThe codec was highly \"asymmetrical\", meaning that it took much more computation to \"encode\" a video stream than to decode it. Intel's ProShare video conferencing system took advantage of this, using hardware acceleration to encode the stream (and thus requiring an add-in card), but allowing the stream to be displayed on any personal computer.\n\npreviously known as \"Real-Time Video 2\", works by delta coding pixels line by line, either against the temporally or spatially directly preceding line, coupled with static Huffman coding.\n\nis a traditional DCT-based transform coding format designed for video playback from CD-ROM that is very similar to the competing Cinepak. It uses chroma subsampling, delta encoding, vector quantization, run-length encoding and motion compensation (inter-frame coding) with a recommended key-frame interval of 4 and has distinctly asymmetric runtime characteristics.\n\nhad greater computational complexity and was aimed at video game developers. It was based on wavelet transforms and included novel features such as chroma-keyed transparency and hot spot support. Initially, there was no support for Apple systems. Two variants of this technology were produced: Indeo Video 4 and 5. The format was never officially documented but later reverse engineered to allow for third-party decoders.\n\nis a transform coding format based on the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT).\n\nOfficial Indeo 5 decoders exist for Microsoft Windows, the classic Mac OS, BeOS R5 and the XAnim player on Unix. Reverse engineered decoders for versions 2, 3, 4 and 5 were introduced in FFmpeg between 2003 and 2011. Indeo version 3 (IV31 and IV32), 4 (IV41) and 5 (IV50) are supported by MPlayer and XAnim. Version 5.11 is freeware and may be used on all 32-bit versions of Windows prior to Vista. Version 5.2 has been created for XP and is available for purchase from the official website for use only with Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000 and XP. This includes support for Indeo Video 4.5 and Indeo Audio 2.5 codecs but the version 3.2 video codec has been removed since the original release of Indeo XP for Windows. Although Indeo video is not officially supported by Windows Vista and Windows 7, simply entering the following into the command prompt might enable the playback of Indeo encoded video: codice_1\n\nThe Microsoft Windows implementation of the Indeo codec contains several security vulnerabilities and one should not play Indeo videos from untrusted sources. MS tried to remove them in XP SP1 but had to release a hotfix to add it back \n. The codec was originally licensed from Intel and MS likely don't have the source code that would be required to fix the vulnerabilities. On fully patched systems and all Windows Vista and later systems the Indeo codec is partially disabled in most circumstances. \n\n"}

Written by co-creators Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt and directed by Whedon, it was originally broadcast on October 5, 1999 on the WB network.\n\nAngel (David Boreanaz) was a character in the first three seasons of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". Angel had been a soulless, immortal vampire who was legendary for his evil acts, until a band of wronged Gypsies punished him in the 19th century by restoring his soul, which overwhelmed him with guilt over his past actions. In the third-season finale, Angel leaves to go to Los Angeles to get away from Buffy, whom he loves but can never be with. In Los Angeles, he meets Doyle (Glenn Quinn), a half-demon who is sent visions by the Powers That Be about people whom Angel is supposed to rescue from danger. Acting on Doyle's first tip, Angel encounters Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), who has moved to L.A. from Sunnydale (where \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" takes place) to pursue a film career. Cordelia convinces Angel that she, Angel and Doyle should start up an agency to help people having supernatural or demonic problems.\n\nAngel drunkenly slumps at the bar of a dive in downtown Los Angeles, growing maudlin about a lost love, when he notices three guys leave the bar with two women, Janice and Laura. His drunken facade fading, Angel unobtrusively follows them out. In the dark alley, Angel kills the three men, who are revealed to be vampires. One of the frightened girls, Janice, bleeding from a minor head wound, tries to thank him, but Angel, fixated on the blood, warns them harshly to get away from him, and strides down the dark alley.\n\nAngel makes his way to his new home, a basement apartment beneath a ground floor office, where he finds Doyle waiting for him. Doyle introduces himself, explaining he's half human, half demon, then recaps the story of Angel's life, ending with his recent, painful breakup with the Slayer and his subsequent move to L.A.. Doyle explains that Angel's isolation, combined with the fact that he recently drank human blood, puts him at serious risk of relapse. Doyle gets visions from The Powers That Be (accompanied by debilitating headaches) regarding people whose lives Angel must touch; true redemption lies not just in saving lives, but in saving souls as well. Doyle concludes by handing over a scrap of paper on which he's jotted information about a young woman named Tina. When Angel asks why Tina needs him, Doyle replies that getting involved in her life enough to figure that out is Angel's first order of business.\n\nAngel finds Tina during her shift and manages to persuade her to meet him after work. Waiting by his car, Angel is surprised to see her in elegant evening dress, and even more surprised when she pulls pepper spray from her purse. Tina accuses Angel of being employed by someone named Russell, but he slowly convinces her to accept his offer of a lift to the \"fabulous Hollywood party\" she plans to attend. When they arrive, Angel runs into Cordelia Chase, whom he last saw at her graduation ceremony at Sunnydale High some months earlier. After a short chat during which she brags about how successful she is, Cordelia leaves, saying that she needs to be talking to \"people that are somebody\". Angel, slightly offended, walks away saying that \"It's nice to see that she's grown as a person.\" Angel sees a man harassing Tina and asks about him. She tells him that he's Stacy, a creep, and says that she would like to leave. On their way into the parking garage, Angel fights off Stacy and his goons.\n\nMeanwhile, in her dingy apartment, Cordelia hangs up her one dress and nibbles snacks she stole from the party because she couldn't afford food, while listening to her talent agent's discouraging phone message. After Tina falls asleep, Angel spends the night on the public library's computers, searching for information about Tina's friend Denise, who disappeared after becoming involved with Russell. The next morning, Angel tells Tina he believes her friend Denise was murdered. As she listens, Tina suddenly spots Doyle's note listing her name and workplace, and, convinced afresh that Angel has been running some scam for Russell, panics and runs. Angel tries to grab her at the building's entrance, but sunlight burns his hand, causing him to turn vampirish reflexively. In stark terror, Tina flees.\n\nRussell Winters, a well-dressed, middle-aged, multi-millionaire businessman, appears and finds Tina when she returns to her apartment to pack. She allows herself to be drawn into his arms; however Russell is actually a vampire and bites her. Angel races to the rescue, only to find Tina dead, marks of vampire predation livid on her throat. \n\nLater that day at his heavily guarded mansion residence, Russell Winters meets with a young lawyer from Wolfram & Hart to discuss his airtight (fictitious) alibi in the matter of Tina's unfortunate demise. Then, Russell orders the lawyer to bring him Cordelia, whom he has selected as his next victim after seeing her in a video clip image taken during the Hollywood party.\n\nAngel tracks down Stacy and interrogates him until he reveals Winters' location, then persuades a reluctant Doyle to help him avenge Tina's death. Excited by her limo ride to meet \"the\" Russell Winters, Cordelia is impressed by his ornate mansion. After a servant ushers her into Russell's den, Cordelia promptly spills the story of her life to her seemingly sympathetic host - until she notices the unusually heavy drapes and lack of mirrors, and concludes aloud that Winters is a vampire. Winters vamps and reaches for Cordelia, who flees. Angel has arrived just in time, though, and rescues her (Although, Doyle stupidly crashed the convertible into the front gate while trying to help after hearing gunshots).\n\nThe next day, Angel stalks into a top floor conference room at the heavily guarded Russell Winters Enterprises building, where Winters is conducting a meeting with his business associates and the young lawyer from the evil law firm of Wolfram & Hart. Not impressed by Winters' claim that he can do whatever he wants in L.A. and get away with anything, Angel asks the CEO if he can fly... then forcefully kicks his executive chair through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Exposed to direct sunlight, a screaming Winters bursts into flame and disintegrates to dust in mid-air. The chair, scorched and empty, smashes to the sidewalk below. As Angel calmly departs, the young Wolfram & Hart lawyer uses his cell phone to report to his firm that, although the \"Senior Partners\" needn't be disturbed by the news of the death of their client just yet, there seems to be a \"new player in town.\"\n\nBack at home, Angel despondently calls Buffy, but when he hears her voice, hangs up without speaking. Later, Cordelia proposes that they put a sign out front and go into the business of saving souls as a team—at least until her \"inevitable stardom\" materializes. Doyle observes many people in L.A. need help and asks Angel if he's game. Angel stands alone atop a skyscraper, looking out over the bustling L.A. nightscape, and responds, \"I'm game.\"\n\nThe vampire prosthetics were a newly created prototype design for this episode, as the production team wanted to try a darker, scarier look. However, they were unhappy with the effect, and soon returned to \"Buffy\"-style vamp-faces.\n\nIn the original script, the scene in which Angel finds Tina's dead body ends with him cradling her, then licking her blood from his fingers. Although creator Joss Whedon claims that moment was the point of the episode, as it shows how Angel is struggling in his goal of redemption, it was ultimately cut. \"It was dark enough that he didn’t save this girl,\" says supervising producer Tim Minear. \"I don’t think you needed him licking her dead body.\" A similar scene occurs in flashback in Season Four, where Angelus reveals this caused Angel to revert to the pathetic state he is in when Whistler encounters him eating rats in 1996.\n\nIn his essay on music as narrative agent, Matthew Mills points out how the theme used for the character of Angel is used multiple times in this episode, at different tempos and by different instruments. When Doyle first offers Angel a chance of redemption, his theme starts but does not end; its \"incompleteness mirroring Angel's inability to answer Doyle's question\". When Angel finally accepts Doyle's challenge at the end of the episode, his theme plays with a \"brief respite from minor tonality\" to underscore his newfound determination.\n\nThe episode has been novelized by Nancy Holder. The novel \"City of\" was published in 1999 and translated into French (\"La Cité des Anges\"), German (\"Stadt der Träume\") and Brazilian Portuguese (\"Bem-Vindo a Los Angeles\"). \n\nSalon.com cautiously praised \"Angel\" for merging the two genres - film noir and the superhero graphic-novel - that best showcase Angel's \"wounded, night-crawling loner mystique\", but worried that Angel's new mission was overly sentimental: \"Is the show going to turn into \"Touched by Angel\"?\"\n\n"}

The format focuses on contemporary hit radio, specialising pop music and chart hits from the 1980s to the present. Ö3 has the biggest audience share by far (averaging 31%) of all Austrian radio stations.\n\nThe station was launched by the ORF broadcaster on 1 October 1967 to a new numbered system, together with the classical music station Österreich 1 and the local radios of the Ö2 group, following a 1964 national referendum against the alignment of the public broadcasting service on the Austrian political \"Proporz\" system. The journalist and radio host Ernst Grissemann was commissioned to build up an entertainment station; he was supported by Frank Elstner, who had worked for Radio Luxembourg, and André Heller presenting the \"Musicbox\" avant-garde music journal. Grissemann served as programme director until 1979, known as \"Mister Ö3\".\n\nA 24-hour programme was introduced in 1977, including hourly news broadcasts, weather forecasts, and traffic news in co-operation with the public ASFiNAG transport company. In the 1980s the popular \"Ö3-Wecker\" morning show was also aired by the German Sender Freies Berlin broadcaster.\n\nUnlike the present-day format radio programme, the Ö3 schedules initially comprised alternative genres and many specialist music shows, with radio hosts like satirists Gerhard Bronner and Stermann & Grissemann, singer-songwriter Ludwig Hirsch or theatre director Axel Corti. While Schlager music was proscribed, the station played a vital role in promoting German-language Austropop tunes. Since a reorganization of ORF's radio channels in 1996, shortly before the introduction in Austria of private commercial radio, alternative programmes have been moved to Ö1 or the newly established FM4 young-adult radio station.\n\nSince 1997, Ö3 broadcasts from a large office floor in the Heiligenstadt district of Vienna. Transmissions include the survey of the Austrian record charts, since 1967 presented by the weekly Austria Top 40 programme. Current renowned presenters include Andi Knoll and Katharina Bellowitsch. Band contests like \"Ö3-Soundcheck\" promoted the career of Austrian music groups such as SheSays, Luttenberger*Klug, Mondscheiner, and Excuse Me Moses. The station participates in the annual Donauinselfest music festival, the \"Licht ins Dunkel\" telethon and co-operates with the Austrian Red Cross.\n\nThe station also broadcasts via satellite television, with a display showing the previous, current and upcoming tracks, the time and other information such as traffic reports.\nThe station's website provides latest reports and information, record charts, a studio webcam, streaming audio, and a daily playlist reaching back to 2009. Several broadcasts are available as podcasts.\n\nÖ3 was for a long time the only ORF station permitted to broadcast commercials, and it remains the station with the largest reach and amount of advertising time per day, more than all private radio stations together. For this reason it is often called \"ORF's cash cow\". \n"}

Western Ghats form an almost continuous mountain wall, except near Palakkad where there is a natural mountain pass known as the Palakkad Gap. When the independent India amalgamated small states together Travancore and Cochin states were integrated to form Travancore-Cochin state on 1 July 1949. However, Malabar remained under the Madras province. The States Reorganisation Act of 1 November 1956 elevated Kerala to statehood.\n\nThe state of Kerala is divided into 14 revenue districts. On the basis of geography the state's districts are generally grouped into three parts :- The \"North Kerala\" districts of Kasaragod, Kannur, Wayanad, Kozhikode, Malappuram ; the \"Central Kerala\" districts of Palakkad, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Idukki and the \"South Kerala\" districts of Kottayam, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram. Such a regional division occurred being part of historical Kingdoms of Kochi, Travancore and British Province of Malabar. The Travancore region was again divided into three zones as Northern Travancore (Hill Range) (Idukki and parts of Ernakullam), Central Travancore (Central Range) (Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha and Kottayam) and Southern Travancore (Southern Range) (Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam). The districts in Kerala are often named after the largest town or city in the district. The 14 districts are further divided into 75 taluks, and 941 Gram panchayats. Some of the districts were renamed in 1990 from the anglicised names to their local names.\n\nKerala State has been divided into 14 districts, 77 taluks, 152 community development blocks, 941 Gram panchayats, 6 corporations and 87 municipalities.\n\nA district is governed by a District Collector, who is an officer from Indian Administrative Service (IAS) of Kerala cadre and is appointed by the State Government of Kerala. Functionally the district administration is carried on through the various Departments of the State Government each of which has an office of its own the district level. The District Collector is the executive leader of the district administration and the District Officers of the various Departments in the district render technical advice to him in the discharge of his duties. The District Collector is a key functionary of Government having large powers and responsibilities. He has a dual role to both as the agent of the Government of the state and also as the representative of the people in the district. He is also responsible for the maintenance of the law and order of the district.\n\nOther than urban units such as town municipalities and rural units called Gram panchayats, other government administrative subdivisions includes taluks and 'community development blocks' (also known as CD blocks or blocks). A taluk consists of urban units such as census towns and rural units called gram panchayats. The \"Tahsildar\" in charge of each taluk is primarily the Revenue Official responsible for the collection of revenue of the taluk, but he is also expected to be in direct contact with the people at all levels and to have first hand knowledge of the conditions of every village under his jurisdiction. The Tahsildar is assisted in each village by village officers and village assistants. A block also consists of such as census towns and Gram panchayats. A block is administered by a Block Development Officer (BDO), who is appointed by the Government of Kerala. A gram panchayat, which consists of a group of villages, is administered by a village council headed by a Gram Panchayat President.\n\nA District Superintendent of Police, better known as a Superintendent of Police, heads the District Police organization of Kerala Police. This is as per the Police Act of 1861, which is applicable to the whole of India. The Superintendents of Police are officers of the Indian Police Service. For every subdivision, there is a Subdivision Police, headed by a Police officer of the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police or Deputy Superintendent of Police. Under subdivisions, there are Police Circles, each headed by an Inspector of Police. A Police Circle consists of Police Stations, each headed by an Inspector of Police, or in case of rural areas, by a Sub-Inspector of Police.\n\nThe Kerala High Court has the jurisdiction of the state of Kerala. Each of the districts has a District Court.\n<mapframe latitude=\"10.347\" longitude=\" 76.638\" zoom=\"7\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" text=\"Districts in Kerala\" align=center>\n</mapframe>\n\nAt the time of formation, Kerala had only five districts: Malabar (part of the erstwhile Madras State), Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Kottayam and Thrissur (together constituting the erstwhile Travancore-Cochin). On 1 January 1957, the Malabar district was divided into the districts of Kozhikode, Palakkad, and Kannur. Alappuzha district was carved out of erstwhile Kottayam and Kollam districts on 17 August 1957. Ernakulam district was formed on 1 April 1958, carving out of parts of erstwhile Thrissur and Kottayam districts. Malappuram district was formed on 16 June 1969 with Ernad and Tirur taluks of the erstwhile Kozhikode district and Perinthalmanna and Ponnani taluks of Palakkad district. Idukki district was formed on 26 January 1972 with Devikulam, Udumbanchola and Peermedu taluks of the erstwhile Kottayam district and Thodupuzha taluk of the erstwhile Ernakulam district. Wayanad district was formed on 1 November 1980 as the 12th district in Kerala by carving out areas from Kozhikode and Kannur districts. Pathanamthitta district was formed on 1 November 1982 carving out the entire Pathanamthitta taluk and nine villages of Kunnathur taluk from Kollam district, entire Thiruvalla taluk and part of Chengannur and Mavelikkara taluks from Alapphuzha district and parts of Idukki district. Kasaragod district was formed on 24 May 1984 as the 14th revenue district by carving out a major portion of the erstwhile Kannur district.\n\n\n"}
