They played 2 Test matches against Zimbabwe and also participated in a triangular Limited Overs International competition with Zimbabwe and India.\n\nConcern for human rights violations in Zimbabwe, in particular the slum clearances known as Operation Murambatsvina, prompted calls by the Green Party and human rights advocates including Amnesty International for the cricket team to boycott the tour. The New Zealand Government made it clear that the scheduled return visit of the Zimbabwean cricket team to New Zealand in December 2005 would not occur as entry to New Zealand would be denied to the Zimbabwean players.\n\nThe Black Caps were obliged to tour by the International Cricket Council, and faced a fine of over NZ$3 million if they did not tour. The ICC was asked to waive this fine but refused. It was also claimed that withdrawal from the tour would greatly harm New Zealand's chances of co-hosting the 2011 Cricket World Cup with a potential loss of $NZ20 million. Two opinion polls showed a majority of New Zealanders opposed the tour. The TVNZ/Colmar Brunton poll taken on 30 June found 77 percent opposed, and a Fairfax New Zealand/ACNielsen poll on 18 July showed 53 percent opposed, (NZ Herald). Parliament voted with a substantial majority on 26 July to ask the Black Caps to abandon the tour. Only ACT and the Māori Party voted against the resolution.\n\nThe two Tests against Zimbabwe were being followed by a tri-nations One Day International series, with India making up the threesome.\n\n\nNew Zealand ran out easy winners in the First Test, winning inside two days by such a margin that it again called the Zimbabweans Test status into question. After the Zimbabwean seamers made early inroads to surprise both the New Zealand batsmen and neutral spectators, New Zealand got the match into their groove. Heath Streak, making his return to international cricket after a one-year self-imposed exile following a dispute with the national selectors, bowled well without much reward, while from the other end Blessing Mahwire removed both openers with three balls, as New Zealand wobbled to 24 for 2. Stephen Fleming and Hamish Marshall rebuilt quickly, punishing Streak in particular, and runs flowed - until Hamish Marshall was lbw to Chris Mpofu with a good in-cutter. New Zealand survived to lunch, but then Nathan Astle and Scott Styris fell, and suddenly the score was 113 for 5.\n\nFrom there, the situation deteriorated for Zimbabwe. Chris Mpofu injured his leg and had to go off the field, leaving only three bowlers, whom Brendon McCullum and Daniel Vettori attacked with venom. Both reached their centuries in less than 100 balls, Vettori smacking twenty fours and two sixes in his 127 before finally being bowled by Streak. Vettori had enjoyed a slice of luck - having inside edged onto his leg stump, the bail refused to fall down, and Vettori made a further 60. By the time he was out, the score had exploded to 432 for 9 - helped by Shane Bond's blitzing 41. At stumps on day one, New Zealand were 452 for 9, and comfortably back in the drivers' seat, as Zimbabwe were left to rue all the poor deliveries in the evening session - which had yielded 213 runs.\n\nJames Franklin and Chris Martin led the NZ attack, taking three wickets each for almost no runs at all, as the Zimbabwean's were dismissed for a dismal 59, with only Taylor (10) and Carlisle (20 not out) and extras (14) making double figures. Five players, including all-rounder Streak failed to score. Forced to follow on, the home side managed 99 in nearly 50 overs. Hamilton Masakadza's 42 was the sole highlight, while nine batsmen were dismissed in single figures, and Vettori enjoyed a cheap four for 28.\n\nNew Zealand ran out comfortable winners yet again, but at least Zimbabwe put up some kind of fight with the bat, passing 200 in both innings. Tatenda Taibu, the Zimbabwean captain, won the toss and chose to bat - and immediately saw the full fury of fast bowler Shane Bond, whose inswingers took care of Dion Ebrahim for 0 and Stuart Carlisle for 1. Bond got a wicket in each of his first three overs, also dismissing Hamilton Masakadza without scoring. Zimbabwe had made seven runs for three wickets, and looked to fade to another sub-100 score.\n\nHowever, Brendan Taylor wanted to repair his dire first Test. After a good partnership with Craig Wishart, the score stood at 74 for 4, and Taylor was there with Tatenda Taibu - however, he went for an overly aggressive cut shot, and Shane Bond got his fourth wicket of the morning session. He got another with the next ball, and by lunch, Zimbabwe were 75 for 6. Taibu, however, recorded his highest innings as captain against anyone except Bangladesh, and his partnership with Blessing Mahwire turned things from total despair to slight hope. Zimbabwe were eventually all out for 231, Daniel Vettori finishing off with the last two wickets after having bowled 27 of 79 overs in the innings.\n\nZimbabwe got a good start by dismissing both Marshall twins, James and Hamish, in successive overs. Hamish's dismissal concluded the day, but Zimbabwe would be hopeful before the second day started. That hope quickly turned to despair. Twenty-eight overs were bowled before lunch, but Zimbabwe failed to take a single wicket, and New Zealand moved into a comfortable position at 180 for 2. New Zealand could push on the accelerator, Nathan Astle getting 128 and Lou Vincent 92, as New Zealand amassed 406 runs on the second day. Graeme Cremer, the leg spinner, bowled 24 overs for 111 runs, to illustrate the Zimbabweans' predicament. Test debutant Keith Dabengwa got two for 87, however, suggesting that he might be a better choice than Cremer for the spinner place in the Zimbabwean team.\n\nHaving been bowled out in 11 overs on the third morning, New Zealand went out into the field with a lead of 253 runs. And the second Zimbabwean innings proceeded in much the same way as the first - Bond dismissing Ebrahim early, Brendan Taylor and Tatenda Taibu staging a recovery, before Blessing Mahwire staged fireworks towards the end. Three of the wickets came as run outs, the last one with Chris Mpofu running back towards Mahwire, who was concentrating on celebrating his half-century. This had evidently not registered with Mpofu, and before he realised his mistake, the stumps at his end were down. Following the match, Zimbabwe's coach Phil Simmons was sacked and replaced with former Zimbabwean international and Zimbabwe A coach Kevin Curran.\n\nPlease see Videocon Tri-Series 2005 for a full treatment of the one-day international matches with Zimbabwe and India.\n\n"}

He is best known as the author of \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\" (1981), which was adapted into the hit feature-length film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988).\n\nWolf was born on January 24, 1941. He grew up in Earlville, Illinois, the son of Ed and Hattie Wolf. His father owned the town's pool hall and later had an upholstering business, while his mother worked in the school cafeteria. As an only child, Wolf would occupy himself by reading comic books and science fiction stories. Wolf graduated from Earlville High School in June 1959.\nHe later attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Advertising and a Master's degree in Communications. He served as an Air Force Captain with the 5th Air Commando Squadron in the Vietnam War, where he won a Bronze Star and two Air Medals.\n\nWolf and childhood friend John J. Myers, former Catholic Archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, co-wrote a novel named \"Space Vulture\", released by TOR books during 2008. \nWolf and co-author Jehane Baptiste have a story named \"The UnHardy Boys in Outer Space\" in the annual anthology of humorous science fiction, \"Amityville House of Pancakes Vol 3\" ().\n\nWolf owns an extensive collection of carousel horses. Because of this, Wolf was featured on the cover of the September 4, 1976 issue of Peninsula Living Magazine; the magazine issue itself also showcased his collection.\n\nWolf currently resides with his wife of 50 years, Bonnie, and their cats, in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nWolf is best known for a series of comedic mystery novels featuring the now famous Roger Rabbit, a cartoon character who inhabits an alternate universe where so-called \"toons\" (an abbreviation for the word \"cartoons\") and humans co-exist. The series begins with the novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\" (1981),\nwhich was the basis of the film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988). The series continued with \"Who P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit?\" in 1991 and \"Who Wacked Roger Rabbit?\" in 2013; these two books were non-canonical to the original book, and had more in common with the hit Disney movie.\n\nWolf filed a lawsuit in 2001 against The Walt Disney Company. Wolf claimed he was owed royalties based on the value of \"gross receipts\" and merchandising sales. In 2002, the trial court in the case ruled that these only referred to actual cash receipts Disney collected and denied Wolf's claim. In its January 2004 ruling, the California Court of Appeals disagreed, finding that Wolf's expert testimony regarding the customary use of \"gross receipts\" in the entertainment business could support a broader reading of the term. The ruling vacated the trial court's order in favor of Disney and remanded the case for further proceedings. In a March 2005 hearing, Wolf estimated he was owed $7 million. Disney's attorneys not only disputed the claim, but also said Wolf actually owed Disney $500,000–$1 million because of an accounting error discovered in preparing for the lawsuit. Wolf won the decision in July 2005, receiving between $180,000 and $400,000 in damages.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2310527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310527", "title": "The Specials (2000 film)", "text": "The Specials (2000 film)\n\nThe Specials is a 2000 American superhero comedy film written by James Gunn and directed by Craig Mazin. It stars an ensemble cast, featuring Thomas Haden Church, James Gunn, Rob Lowe, Jamie Kennedy, Judy Greer, Sean Gunn, Paget Brewster, Jordan Ladd, Jim Zulevic and Kelly Coffield.\n\nThe film follows a group of ordinary superheroes on their day off. According to the film, the Specials are the sixth or seventh most popular group of superheroes in the world. Unlike most superhero films, \"The Specials\" has almost no action and few special effects; instead it focuses on the average day-to-day lives of the heroes.\n\nThe superhero team the Specials has never achieved great popularity or prestige, partially because unlike other super teams it is not corporation-friendly and has been unable to secure merchandising deals. Without the corporate or private financial resources of more well-established teams, the Specials often get underrated villains, small disasters, and the occasional alien invasion to repel — all of which are deemed too low-priority for other superhero teams. Even the members with formidable powers have shortcomings that prevented a transition for the team as a whole. Because team-members such as the Strobe, Ms. Indestructible, The Weevil, Deadly Girl, Power Chick, Amok, Alien Orphan, and Eight all possess various social dysfunctions, they've never quite broken through the superhero glass ceiling.\n\nThe team welcomes Nightbird (Jordan Ladd), the group's newest member, a teenage girl with \"bird powers.\" Nightbird, who idolizes the Specials, soon realizes that her heroes do not function as a harmonious team but like a dysfunctional family. One of the two greatest points of stress in the team is the slowly fracturing relationship between the Strobe (Thomas Haden Church) and Ms. Indestructible (Paget Brewster), a married couple at the core of the team. Also problematic is that the Weevil is trying to negotiate an exit into a more high-profile superhero team, playing both on his own popularity and his legacy status from following in his father's footsteps.\n\nThe cracks begin to show as they prepare to attend a dinner in their honor thrown by Kosgrov Toys, which is releasing a line of action figures based upon the group. The event is a travesty. It becomes quickly apparent that Kosgrov did little research on the Specials, and low-balled the production by utilizing cheap accessories and recycled parts. Worse yet, the leader of the Specials, the Strobe, discovers that his wife, Ms. Indestructible, is cheating on him with the most popular member of the group, The Weevil (Rob Lowe). In a fit of anger, the Strobe disbands the group, and the members go their own ways.\n\nThe Strobe goes to Zip Boy's (Barry Del Sherman) house and asks for a job at New Standards Inc., a plastics company in Detroit, denying there's a problem by saying that he's great, now that he has \"a great new job as a welding asshole.\" Ms. Indestructible spends the night watching her old wedding video and crying over a glass of wine. The Strobe's brother, Minute Man (James Gunn), who had had a crush on the new girl, Nightbird, ultimately falls into the arms of Deadly Girl (Judy Greer), who, because of her loyalty to the Strobe as leader, was hurt to learn about Weevil and Ms. Indestructible. Meanwhile, Amok (Jamie Kennedy), Power Chick (Kelly Coffield), Alien Orphan (Sean Gunn), and Mr. Smart (Jim Zulevic) indulge in a night of drinking and dancing.\n\nDuring the disbandment, the Weevil finalizes his transfer to another superhero team, only to find that his negative press from the Specials still follows him. Reporters focus more on his controversy than his ability to apprehend villains, and the Weevil finds he has gone from being the top dog in a small team to the team runt in the larger one. The Strobe and Ms. Indestructible reconcile, and the Strobe renews his passion for justice instead of image. The team is immediately called back into action and the heroes resolve to do the right thing not because it will bring popularity or glory, but because as misfits, they've become the champions of society's underdogs. They exit to face down another crisis, giant ants attacking the White House; as they assemble, they actively demonstrate their powers for the first time in the entire film.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2310531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310531", "title": "HMS Erebus (1807)", "text": "HMS Erebus (1807)\n\nHMS \"Erebus\" was originally built as a Royal Navy fireship, but served as a sloop and was re-rated as such in March 1808. She served in the Baltic during the Gunboat and Anglo-Russian Wars, where in 1809 she was briefly converted to a fireship, and then served in the War of 1812. In 1814 she was converted to a rocket vessel to fire Congreve rockets. While serving off America, \"Erebus\" participated in the sack of Alexandria, Virginia, and launched the rockets that bombarded Fort McHenry in Baltimore on 13 September 1814. In March 1815, off Georgia, she fired the second-to-the-last-shot of the war. She was laid up in 1816 and sold for breaking up in 1819.\n\nCommander William Autridge commissioned \"Erebus\" in January 1808, and she sailed for the Baltic in April.\n\nIn July, Vice-Admiral Sir James Saumarez and his British fleet were blockading Rager Vik (Ragerswik or Rogerswick or Russian: Baltiyskiy) where the Russian fleet was sheltering after the British 74-gun third rates and \"Centaur\" had destroyed the Russian 74-gun ship of the line \"Vsevolod\".\n\nSaumarez wanted to attack the fleet and ordered that \"Erebus\" and \"Baltic\" be prepared as fireships. However, when the British discovered that the Russians had stretched a defensive chain across the entrance to the harbour, precluding an attack by fireships, Saumarez abandoned the plan and the two vessels returned to normal duties.\n\nBetween 28 October and 9 November, \"Erebus\" captured the Danish sloops \"Debitor\", \"Ellen Maria\" and \"Rengende Jacob\". On 28 October \"Erebus\" captured the Danish galliot \"Emanuel\". On 29 November \"Erebus\" and \"Devastation\" captured the Danish galliots \"Ellen Maria\", \"Gertrude Maria\" and \"Fem Sodskende\". Between 30 November and 6 December, \"Erebus\" captured the Danish vessels \"Neptunus\", \"Neptunus\" and \"Frau Maria\".\n\nAt some point Commander Henry Withy assumed command. On 4 August 1809, Captain Thomas Byam Martin of \"Implacable\", while off Hogland, assigned \"Erebus\" to patrol between Aspo and Sommars rock. Her mission was to harry Russian shipping and give warning should she spot the Russian fleet exiting Kronstadt.\n\nOn 24 October \"Erebus\", again under the command of Autridge, captured the \"Courier\". Almost a month later, on 16 November, , with \"Erebus\" in company, captured the \"Concordia\". That day \"Rose\" was in company with \"Erebus\", the cutter and the hired armed cutter \"Mary\" when they captured the \"Catherine Elizabeth\".\n\nThe next day \"Erebus\" captured four vessels. One was the \"Chriftina\", N. Jorgensen (or Jergensen), master. \"Erebus\" was in company with \"Rose\" when they captured the Danish sloop \"Anna Catherina\", H.P. Larsen, master. \"Rose\", \"Cheerful\" and \"Mary\" were in sight as \"Erebus\" captured the \"Twende Brodre\", H. Holmer, master. \"Rose\" was also in company when she and \"Erebus\" captured the Danish sloop \"Anna Margaretha\".\n\nOn 29 December \"Erebus\" captured the Crown schooner No. 27. The next day \"Erebus\" captured the \"Elizabeth Christina\". The day after that \"Erebus\" captured the \"Victoria\", Hans Larsen, late master.\n\n\"Erebus\" was employed on convoy duties and on 21 June 1810 she and \"Loire\" escorted 100 vessels through the Great Belt into the Baltic. On 6 July 1810, \"Erebus\" captured the \"Vrou Sitske\". On 28 July \"Erebus\" captured the \"Maria\", J. Schumacha, master. Then on 13 August she captured the \"Maria Sophia\", J.C. Guhlstoff, master.\n\n\"Erebus\" was at Hull on 2 October, having just detained the \"Hopper\", \"Somanberg\", and \"Maria Sofie Guhlstorff\", from Saint Petersburg. On 17 December 1811, \"Erebus\" captured the Danish sloop \"Fuldmannen\", A. Anderson, master.\n\nIn 1812 \"Erebus\" was again employed on convoy escort in the Baltic under Saumarez. On 12 May \"Erebus\", under the command of Commander George Brine, the Danish sloop \"Snelvegen\". Then on 25 May \"Erebus\" recaptured the \"Diverdina\".\n\nOn 15 June \"Erebus\", again under the command of William Autridge, captured the Danish sloop \"Henrietta\", Anders Jergensen, master. On 18 August 1812, Commander Henry Lyford took command and served on her until he was made post-captain on 4 December 1813.\n\nOn 4 October captured the Danish sloop \"Speculation\" and shared the prize money with \"Persian\", \"Erebus\", and by agreement. Then on 17 October \"Persian\" and \"Erebus\" were again in company with \"Podargus\" when \"Podargus\" captured the Danish vessels \"Anna Maria\", \"Twende Brodre\", and two market-boats. Next month, on 11 November \"Podargus\" captured \"Syerstadt\", with \"Persian\" and \"Erebus\" in company. On 16 December \"Persian\" captured the Danish galliot \"Ebenetzer\", with \"Thracian\" in company. \"Erebus\" shared in the prize money by agreement with \"Persian\".\n\nOn 27 July 1813 \"Sheldrake\", \"Erebus\", \"Thracian\", and \"Woodlark\" captured the \"Forsoget\", \"Stephanus\", and \"Erskine\". Prize money was paid on 15 January 1819. Then on 20 October , \"Erebus\", and captured the \"Venus\". Prize money for this vessel too was paid on 15 January 1819. After Lyford, \"Erebus\" then came under the command of Commander John Forbes.\n\nIn early 1814, during the War of 1812, while under the command of John Forbes, \"Erebus\" was again in Baltic. However, in April, while under Commander David Ewen Bartholomew, she was at Woolwich, fitting as a Congreve rocket ship and for the North American station. She was equipped with a battery of 32-pound Congreve rockets installed below the main deck, which fired through portholes or scuttles pierced in the ship's side. This was an improved version of the design that Congreve had first installed in . On 23 May \"Erebus\" attempted to leave Portsmouth for the North American station but contrary winds forced her to put back. Still, on 29 May she was at Cork and got underway with the convoy for Newfoundland, Halifax and Quebec.\n\nOn 17 August 1814, Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane detached \"Devastation\", \"Euryalus\", \"Ætna\", \"Meteor\", \"Manly\" and \"Erebus\", all under Captain Alexander Gordon in \"Seahorse\", to go up the Potomac and bombard Fort Washington, which was on the left bank of the river, some ten or twelve miles below Washington itself. The British suffered from several disadvantages. First, they lacked pilots that knew the Kettle-Bottoms, a difficult stretch of the river. Second, the winds blew in the wrong direction, slowing their advance. Consequently, it took them ten days to reach the fort, and during the journey all the ships grounded at least 20 times. For five successive days they had to warp over a distance of 50 miles.\n\nOn the evening of 27 August the bomb vessels started bombarding Fort Washington. This caused the garrison to flee. However, suspecting trickery, Captain Gordon ordered the vessels to continue to fire, only ceasing when the powder magazine exploded at eight o'clock.\n\nThe following morning the British occupied the defenses. The principal fort contained two 52-pounder, two 32-pounder and eight 24-pounder guns. On the beach there was also battery of five 18-pounders; there was also a Martello tower with two 12-pounders and a battery in the rear with two 12 and six 6-pound field guns. Before they fled the Americans had spiked the guns; the British landing party of seamen and marines completed the destruction, especially of the gun carriages. The loss of the forts and batteries left the town of Alexandria undefended.\n\nBetween 31 August and 6 September \"Erebus\" and the squadron continued on the Potomac River. They took Alexandria and also captured 21 merchant vessels. While there the British looted stores and warehouses of 16,000 barrels of flour, 1,000 hogsheads of tobacco, 150 bales of cotton and some $5,000 worth of wine, sugar and other items.\n\nThe Americans had placed two field guns in a battery situated high on a bluff at White House Plantation (modern day Fort Belvoir), and had fired on as she sailed to reach Gordon. On 1 September, Gordon sent \"Fairy\" and \"Meteor\" to engage the battery to impede its completion, but they were unsuccessful. In all, the Americans had established batteries with a total of 11 guns - five naval long guns and eight artillery field pieces.\nThe British spent most of 2 September mustering their ships and prizes for the run down river while awaiting favourable winds. At the same time they were working to free \"Devastation\", which had run aground.\n\nOn 3 September the bomb vessel \"Ætna\" and \"Erebus\" joined in the effort to suppress the American batteries. That same day, Commodore John Rodgers, with four U.S. gunboats and some fireships, made an unsuccessful attempt to destroy \"Devastation\". Sniping and gunfire continued throughout 4 and 5 September, as the Virginia militia arrived to block British landings at the batteries.\n\nOn 6 September the frigates \"Seahorse\" and \"Euryalus\" came down the river and joined \"Fairy\". The three vessels shifted their ballast to the port side to enable their combined 63 starboard guns to elevate sufficiently to engage the batteries. They then opened fire and within 45 minutes had silenced the American cannons.\n\nAll eight British warships and their prizes, 22 merchant vessels, brigs, ships and schooners, moved back to the main fleet. During the run down the river the British had suffered only seven dead and 35 wounded, including Charles Dickson, \"Fairys\" second lieutenant. However, \"Erebus\" alone lost one man killed and 16 men wounded; two died, eight were severely wounded and Commander Bartholomew, Lieutenant Reuben Paine and four others were slightly wounded. The Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with the clasp \"The Potomac 17 Augt. 1814\" to those members of the vessels' crews that had survived to 1847.\n\n\"Erebus\" was one of the ships involved in the bombardment of Fort McHenry in the Battle of Baltimore.\n\n\"Erebus\", \"Meteor\", \"Ætna\", , , and \"Devastation\" moved up the Patapsco River on 12 September 1814 in preparation for an attack on Baltimore. They commenced their bombardment on Fort McHenry and the water batteries on 13 September, but were ordered to withdraw the next day. It was fire from \"Erebus\" that provided the \"rockets' red glare\" that Francis Scott Key described in The Star-Spangled Banner.\n\nIn February 1815 \"Erebus\" was with Sir George Cockburn's squadron off Georgia. She contributed her boats to a force of 186 seamen and marines under Captain Phillott of . This force then proceeded to sail up the St Mary's River to attack an American detachment.\n\nThe force had navigated fairly far up river when they came under unexpected fire from Spanish Florida. The British soon silenced the fire, but Phillott decided to retreat as the river ahead was narrow (only 30 to 40 yards wide), with commanding heights and houses to their rear. During the withdrawal, the expedition was exposed to harassing fire for over ten hours. In all, the expedition cost the British three men killed and 15 wounded. Bartholomew, of \"Erebus\", was hit four times. He took his first hit in his head and then a second ball hit his middle finger and thumb when he put his hand up to feel the first wound. He was also hit in the neck and throat. Phillott too was wounded twice.\n\nOn 16 March 1815 \"Erebus\" fired the second-to-the-last shot of the war when she fired a shot at Gunboat No. 168 in Wassaw Sound, off Georgia, even though Bartholomew knew the war was over and the gunboat's master, Mr. John H. Hurlburd, had announced that he was carrying letters for Cockburn. No. 168 fired one shot \"pro forma\" across the bows of \"Erebus\" and then struck. When Hurlburd came aboard \"Erebus\", Bartholomew apologized and stated that he had not given any order to fire. Fortunately, \"Erebuss\" shot had been fired high and had only done a little damage to some ropes and the sail on No. 168.\n\n\"Erebus\" returned to England on 28 April. Bartholomew received promotion to post-captain on 13 June, but remained with \"Erebus\" until after she had assisted in the repatriation via Ostend of the British wounded from Waterloo. Still, in June 1815 \"Erebus\" came under the command of Commander Francis le Hunte.\n\nOn 25 June and again on 5 July \"Erebus\" and arrived at Deal from Ostend with French prisoners. On the first trip she convoyed transports that between them were carrying 8,000 French prisoners.\n\n\"Erebus\" was laid up at Deptford in 1816. The Admiralty sold her on 22 July 1819 for ₤1,150 to Mr. Manlove for breaking up.\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n"}

It is a phrase which can also be used as an excuse to deflect blame away from specific individuals, such as high-powered executives, and instead redirect it to the more anonymous clerical staff.\n\nA clerical error in a legal document is called a scrivener's error.\n\nThere is a considerable body of case law concerning the proper treatment of a scrivener's error. For example, where the parties to a contract make an oral agreement that, when reduced to a writing, is mistranscribed, the aggrieved party is entitled to reformation so that the writing corresponds to the oral agreement.\n\nA scrivener's error can be grounds for an appellate court to remand a decision back to the trial court. For example, in \"Ortiz v. State of Florida,\" Ortiz had been convicted of possession of less than 20 g of marijuana, a misdemeanor. However, Ortiz was mistakenly adjudicated guilty of a felony for the count of marijuana possession. The appellate court held that \"we must remand the case to the trial court to correct a scrivener's error.\"\n\nIn some circumstances, courts can also correct scrivener's errors found in primary legislation.\n\nOver 18 minutes of the Watergate tapes were erased by Richard Nixon's secretary, Rose Mary Woods, in a claimed clerical error. Some writers have suggested that this may have changed the course of American history.\n\n"}
{"id": "2310546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310546", "title": "Hooked on Monkey Fonics", "text": "Hooked on Monkey Fonics\n\n\"Hooked on Monkey Fonics\" is the twelfth episode of the third season of the animated television series \"South Park\". It originally aired on November 10, 1999. It features issues of homeschooling and phonics, a method of teaching children to read. This is the final episode of South Park to feature the voice talents of Mary Kay Bergman, who died by suicide the day after the episode aired. The final episode to use her dialogue was \"Starvin' Marvin in Space\" which ended production shortly before her death.\n\nIn preparation for a spelling bee, Cartman's mother buys him a \"Hooked on Monkey Fonics\" system that features an actual live monkey playing the drums to keep with the beat of spelling and sounding out the words. After spelling a couple of words, Cartman believes he will have a chance to win the spelling bee. While at the spelling bee, the children face stiff competition from two homeschooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswalds. Cartman asks the monkey to help him spell his word, \"chair\", but Phonics Monkey is masturbating, and Cartman misspells it as \"C-H-A-R-E\"; angered, he runs off to chase the monkey. In the final round, Kyle is unable to spell his word, \"\"Kroxldyphivc\"\" (which in reality isn't an actual word), correctly and Rebecca and Mark are declared the champions. Although Kyle is annoyed at having been beaten, he ends up developing a crush on Rebecca.\n\nMark becomes intrigued by the interactions he sees between Cartman, Kyle, and Stan, and begs his father to be allowed to attend public school. His father objects due to how dangerous public schools can be, but reluctantly relents. At the school, Mark, placed in a largely protective hamster ball by his overprotective father, is tormented for his haughty attitude and superior knowledge, and ends up duct taped to a bench by the other boys. This prompts Mark's father to speak with the adults in Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails about the incident and the fact that Kyle has become smitten with Rebecca and should stop pursuing her. The adults are quick to dislike him as much as the kids dislike Mark; after learning that he does not drink beer but prefers wine coolers, they proceed to duct tape Mark's father to one of the bar's benches.\n\nAfter questioning Mark about why he has never been seen before and why he does not attend school like the other children, Cartman is introduced to the concept of home schooling. The idea of never having to go to school appeals to him greatly, and, using Mr. Garrison's condescending remarks towards him as an excuse, demands to be home schooled himself. To him, this involves a regimen of sleeping in and sitting in bed while snacking and watching television, while his mother unsuccessfully attempts to get him to study. When Stan and Kenny come to visit to tell him about the Bay of Pigs Memorial Dance, Phonics Monkey kills Kenny.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle makes many efforts to make his feelings known to Rebecca, although several end up humorously unsuccessful. Ultimately he convinces her to explore the world of public schooling, and she agrees to go to the South Park dance with him. He also explains what love is to her and, out of curiosity, she asks Kyle if she can experiment a kiss with him, to which he agrees. After kissing him, Rebecca immediately changes when she agrees to Kyle's dance proposal (\"You bet your sweet ass I'll go.\")\n\nAt the dance, the band Dio plays their song \"Holy Diver\". The boys of the school hatch a plan to duct tape Mark to the flagpole while the adults also hatch a similar plan for Mark's father. When Rebecca enters the dance dressed up promiscuously and kissing every boy in sight, Mark is outraged and attacks Kyle for turning his sister \"into a slut.\" The other boys perceive his beating up Kyle as cool and finally accept him; Randy Marsh breaks up the fight, with Mark warning Kyle he's not through with him. Mr. and Mrs. Cotswald arrive and interrupt the dance, looking for their children so they could leave. Mark gets onstage and makes a speech to his parents (particularly to his father) about the benefits of public schools - \"...it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves.\" Mr. Cotswald, affected by his son's speech, agrees to let Rebecca and Mark regularly attend public school; Rebecca and Kyle then share a kiss. Mark's father, however, is then duct taped to the flagpole in front of the school by the adults, regardless of his change in attitude and opinion. Dio restarts and plays \"Holy Diver\" over the end credits, with Phonics Monkey joining in on drums.\n\nThe character of Rebecca is based on Rebecca Sealfon who won the 1997 Scripps National Spelling Bee. She is one of the most well-known spelling bee winners, spelling her final word, \"euonym,\" by screaming out each letter. She also displayed the odd habit of covering her mouth and whispering each letter before saying it, which was parodied in the episode as well.\n\nKyle's speech to Rebecca about love parodies the \"Star Trek\" episode \"The Gamesters of Triskelion\"; a musical cue often used in romantic scenes during \"The Original Series\" can also be heard during this scene. Kyle's love confession and kiss with Rebecca parodies a scene between Judah Ben-Hur and Esther in \"Ben-Hur\".\n\nWhen band leader Ronnie James Dio was asked how he felt about \"South Park\"'s parody of him, he said \"I thought it was wonderful. I initially didn't want to let it be done because I felt that they were just going to crucify me [and] that I would end up being like what they did to Rod Stewart, and what they did to Elton John, and what they did to Ozzy. But they assured our office that they were real Dio fans and that I would like it. So I thought to myself \"Well if you want to be an American icon, you better let them do it\". And they did, and I was knocked out. It was funny. I thought they were more cruel to the drummer, if anything else.\"\n\nIn 2006, IGN listed the episode as #10 on their list of their 10 Favorite South Park Episodes.\n\n"}

It was released six years after the original, and was the first in the series to be a direct-to-video production.\n\n\"The Great Valley Adventure\" is also the first \"The Land Before Time\" direct-to-video film to be animated overseas by AKOM in Seoul, South Korea. The tone, action and plot of the film was made much softer and slower than that of the original, and features musical numbers, in order to appeal to a more preschooler-oriented audience. Candace Hutson is the film's only returning voice actor, reprising her role as Cera. After the film's release, subsequent sequels in the series, with animation services by AKOM, were released each year up until 1998's \"\".\n\nLittlefoot, Cera, Ducky, Petrie and Spike live a carefree life in the Great Valley under their families' watchful eyes. One day, the gang attempts to get to the sheltering grass to play, but land in the sinking sand surrounding it. The adults rescue them and chastise them for their recklessness. The next night, the children have a secret meeting and decide to prove their bravery and maturity by venturing into the Mysterious Beyond, a location outside the Valley that is inhabited by Sharpteeth. Before they leave, they notice two egg stealers, Ozzy and Strut, stealing an egg from the nest of Ducky's mother. The children pursue the intruders into the Mysterious Beyond. An ensuing landslide damages the Great Wall that surrounds the Valley and protects it from the Sharpteeth, and the stolen egg rolls safely back to the nest, but the group do not notice this in the confusion.\n\nIn the Mysterious Beyond, the group discover another, larger egg and mistake it for the original. The gang transports the egg into the Valley, and despite finding the original egg back in Ducky's nest, they decide to hatch it. The egg eventually hatches, revealing a baby Sharptooth. Although Littlefoot's friends are frightened off, Littlefoot quickly realizes that the baby Sharptooth is not yet dangerous, and decides to raise the newly-christened \"Chomper\" as his parent. This task proves difficult as Chomper is not an herbivore, and Littlefoot has no experience raising a child. Ozzy and Strut appear to exact revenge on the group for foiling their earlier theft, but are driven away by Chomper's enlarged shadow, which they mistake for that of an adult Sharptooth. The rest of the gang meets Chomper and they accept him as part of the group until he hungrily bites Cera by instinct. The group's knee-jerk reaction causes Chomper to run off in tears. The others follow him to a smoking mountain, where Ozzy and Strut attempt once more to attack the children, but are stopped when the mountain's eruption sends them plummeting down a canyon. After the group escapes, they encounter two adult Sharpteeth, who have managed to enter the Valley through the opening in the Great Wall. The whole Great Valley population drives the Sharpteeth off, and the children make it back to their families, but Chomper feels left out and runs away again.\n\nThe adults inquire as to how the Sharpteeth entered the Valley, prompting the children to explain the events that resulted in the landslide. The adults set off to put together a plan to close the opening for good, telling the children to stay behind. Littlefoot runs to the forest to find Chomper. After finding him, they are chased and cornered by the two Sharpteeth. Chomper roars at them, and they recognize him as their son and leave with him. Littlefoot is then kidnapped by Ozzy and Strut, who plan to throw him off the Great Wall. Chomper hears Littlefoot screaming and leads his parents to Littlefoot's location. Chomper's parents rescue Chomper from an attempted intervention, and inadvertently do the same for Littlefoot by chasing Ozzy and Strut back into the Mysterious Beyond. Littlefoot bids Chomper farewell as he follows his parents, and he returns to the Valley to assist the adults in sealing up the entrance between the Valley and the Mysterious Beyond. Following his experiences, Littlefoot tells his grandparents that being young is not so bad after all, but decides he still looks forward to growing up.\n\n\nThe songs are written by The Roches. This was the film that introduced the musical element into the series and it has consistently remained ever since. This was also the first time Spike \"sings\"; his lips can be seen moving during \"You're One of Us Now\".\n\n\nAlso, even though the film features an original score by Michael Tavera, it contains musical cues from James Horner's score of the original film. Tavera has been the main music composer for the sequels ever since.\n\nIn July 1993, Universal Cartoon Studios announced that a direct-to-video sequel to \"The Land Before Time\" was in development. A release date was not set at that time.\n\nThe film was released on VHS and laserdisc on December 23, 1994 in the US, and on December 31, 1995 in the UK. It was re-released on VHS on December 4, 2001. On December 10, 2002, the film was released onto DVD. On December 2, 2003, the film was released onto VHS and DVD as part of the \"4 Movie Dino Pack (Volume 1)\" and \"9 Movie Dino Pack\" movie collections. On January 25, 2005, the film was re-released onto DVD as part of the \"2 Great Movies Featuring Chomper\" collection. On May 3, 2016, the film was re-released on DVD as part of a DVD pack alongside all 14 films.\n\nIn 2011, \"Total Film\" ranked it as 7th among the \"50 Worst Kids Movies\". In August 2014, the \"New York Post\" ranked each of the 13 \"Land Before Time\" films released up to that point and placed \"The Great Valley Adventure\" at number 5. The \"New York Post\" wrote that out of each film, \"The Great Valley Adventure\" \"does the best job of maintaining some of the darker tone of the original movie while broadening its humor for younger audiences. But it's also responsible for introducing the musical format, so, boo.\" The film received a nomination for \"Best Animated Video Production\" at the 23rd Annie Awards in 1995, losing to \"The Gate to the Mind's Eye\".\n"}
{"id": "2310551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310551", "title": "Steve Stricker", "text": "Steve Stricker\n\nSteven Charles Stricker (born February 23, 1967) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour and the PGA Tour Champions. He has twelve victories on the PGA Tour, including the WGC-Match Play title in 2001 and two FedEx Cup playoff events. His most successful season on tour came at age 42 in 2009, with three victories and a runner-up finish on the money list. Stricker spent over 250 weeks in the top-10 of the Official World Golf Ranking, reaching a career-high world ranking of No. 2 in September 2009. Stricker will serve as U.S. Ryder Cup captain for the 2020 matches, set for Whistling Straits in his home state of Wisconsin.\n\nBorn in Edgerton, Wisconsin, Stricker grew up playing golf at both Lake Ripley Country Club in nearby Cambridge and at the Edgerton Towne Country Club in Edgerton. A 1990 graduate of the University of Illinois, Stricker earned All-American honors as a member of the Illini golf team in 1988 and 1989.\n\nStricker turned professional in 1990 and began his career on the Canadian Professional Golf Tour, where he won two tournaments. He joined the PGA Tour in 1994, and his first success at the top level came in 1996, when Stricker notched two victories (Kemper Open, Motorola Western Open) and seven top ten finishes on his way to finishing fourth on the 1996 PGA Tour money list.\n\nIn 1998, Stricker played himself into contention in the final round of the PGA Championship at Sahalee Country Club near Seattle. Thanks to a back-nine surge, PGA Tour veteran Vijay Singh bested Stricker down the stretch and claimed a two-stroke victory. This runner-up finish remains Stricker's best result in a major championship to date. Stricker has finished inside the top-20 six times at the U.S. Open, with his best finish a fifth-place in 1999 at Pinehurst No. 2. He won his third and most prestigious PGA Tour title at the WGC Match Play Championship in 2001, where he defeated Pierre Fulke 2 and 1 in Australia, to earn the $1,000,000 prize. This remains as the only time that the WGC Match Play Championship was played outside of the United States.\n\nStricker lost his tour card in 2004. At age 39 in 2006, relying on sponsor exemptions, he managed seven top-ten finishes and was voted the tour's Comeback Player of the Year. In 2007 he won his fourth PGA Tour title at The Barclays on August 26, ending an 11-year victory drought on American soil, although he had previously triumphed down in Australia in 2001. This run of success earned him a spot on the Presidents Cup team in 2007.\n\nAfter his victory at The Barclays, which was the first of the four FedEx Cup playoff events, Stricker reached No. 4 in the Official World Golf Ranking, his highest career ranking at that point. Stricker finished runner-up in the 2007 FedEx Cup Playoffs behind Tiger Woods, and was again selected as Comeback Player of the Year. He was also inducted into the Wisconsin State Golf Association Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nAt the Mercedes Benz Championship, the opening event of the 2008 season, Stricker lost out in a play-off to Daniel Chopra. This result took Stricker to No. 3 in the Official World Golf Ranking, again at the time his highest ranking to date.\n\nAt the Bob Hope Classic in January 2009, Stricker shot third and fourth round scores of 61 and 62, at the PGA West Palmer and Nicklaus courses, to set the 36-hole scoring record on the PGA Tour at 123, beating a record that Pat Perez had held for only two days. (This record fell in October when Troy Matteson shot 61-61=122 at the Frys.com Open.) His four-round total of 33-under-par in the five-round event also set the PGA Tour record for lowest score relative to par for 72 holes, exceeding Ernie Els' total of 31 under par in the 2003 Mercedes-Benz Championship at Kapalua. The third-round 61 was Stricker's best score on tour to that point, but a 77 in the final round dropped him into a tie for third.\n\nStricker won his fifth PGA Tour title at Colonial in Texas at the end of May 2009, with a playoff win over Tim Clark and Steve Marino. The win was aided by a chip-in on the 71st hole. He won again in July at the John Deere Classic in Silvis, Illinois. After the second round was rained-out on Friday, the field was forced to play 36 holes on Sunday. Stricker shot an afternoon round of 64, which included a hole-out wedge shot for eagle on the 6th hole, and by three strokes over runners-up Zach Johnson, Brandt Snedeker, and Brett Quigley. He also matched his career low round on tour with a second round of 61 (−10).\n\nStricker's third win of 2009, and seventh overall, came in September at the Deutsche Bank Championship, the second of four playoff events. He began the final round tied with Retief Goosen and Sean O'Hair, and birdied the final hole to win the event by one stroke over Jason Dufner and Scott Verplank. It was Stricker's second FedEx Cup playoff win, a win that also vaulted him ahead of Tiger Woods to the top of the FedEx Cup standings and vaulted him to No. 2 in the Official World Golf Ranking, his highest ranking achieved during his career. Stricker has been called \"Mr. September\" due to his success in the FedEx Cup playoffs, where he has never finished outside the top-25 in his first ten career starts.\n\nIn February 2010, Stricker won his eighth tour title at the Northern Trust Open with a 16-under-par 268 winning total. With this win at Riviera, he passed Phil Mickelson and regained his ranking as World No. 2.\n\nIn July, Stricker shot a career-low 60 (−11) in the first round of the John Deere Classic. However, a 59 shot by Paul Goydos incredibly put him one stroke back of the lead. He followed with rounds of 66 and 62, for a total of 188, to set a tour 54-hole scoring record. He then shot 70 on Sunday to win his ninth PGA Tour win, two strokes ahead of Goydos.\n\nIn June 2011, Stricker won at the Memorial Tournament in Ohio, his tenth tour title. He opened with 68 and bettered this with 67 in the second round. However, this was made special by the hole-in-one he recorded at the par three 8th hole to hold a three stroke advantage at the halfway stage. Remarkably, he then opened round three with two eagles in the first five holes to open up a six-shot lead midway through round three, but some uncharacteristic mistakes on the back nine saw him fall back towards the rest of the field. He held on to the 36-hole lead to eventually win by one stroke over runners-up Matt Kuchar and Brandt Jobe. With this victory, Stricker became the highest-ranked American in the Official World Golf Ranking, at fourth in the world. For the first time in his career, 44-year-old Stricker was ranked higher than all other American golfers, including Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. Stricker played the tournament at −20 for the front nine, a record by 6 shots, versus +4 for the back nine.\n\nStricker gained his eleventh tour win at the John Deere Classic in July, sinking a birdie putt at the 72nd hole, one stroke ahead of runner-up Kyle Stanley. In a commanding position throughout most of Sunday's round, Stricker bogeyed the 15th and 16th to fall two strokes behind Stanley. He then bounced back with a birdie on the par five 17th while Stanley made bogeyed the 18th. Stricker, tied for the lead at this point, drove into a fairway bunker off the tee and then played his second shot just over the back of the green, but holed the putt from the fringe for the victory. This was Stricker's third straight victory at the John Deere Classic becoming just the 10th golfer since World War II to win a tournament three straight times.\n\nStricker tied a major championship record with a 63 in the first round at the PGA Championship in 2011, and led by two shots. His next three days were 74-69-73, and he tied for twelfth. Stricker's career earnings are over $44 million through the end of the 2018–19 season, among the highest of those without a major title.\n\nStricker started the 2012 season with a win in the season-opening Tournament of Champions at Kapalua on Maui. He shot a ten-under 63 on day two and held the lead until the very end, three strokes ahead of runner-up Martin Laird. It was his twelfth PGA Tour title. He missed the cut in May at The Players Championship, his first since the 2009 PGA Championship. It ended a streak of 49 consecutive cuts, which was the longest on tour.\n\nAt the start of the 2013 season, Stricker announced he would cut his schedule \"in half,\" hoping to play just \"10 or 12\" tournaments. As the defending champion, he finished runner-up at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions despite suffering from a herniated disc. He then reached the quarterfinals at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, his best performance since his victory in 2001.\n\nIn 2017, Stricker joined the PGA Tour Champions. In his first event, the Tucson Conquistadores Classic, he finished one stroke behind Tom Lehman. Stricker asked the USGA for a special exemption to play in the 2017 U.S. Open held in his home state, but his request was denied. He eventually earned entry through a qualifying tournament in Memphis. Stricker was the captain of the victorious U.S. team in the 2017 Presidents Cup.\n\nIn March 2018, Stricker won his first event on the PGA Tour Champions, the Cologuard Classic by two strokes. He then won his second straight start at the Rapiscan Systems Classic in Saucier, Mississippi. In September 2018, he won the Sanford International tournament on the PGA Tour Champions.\n\nIn 2018, U.S. captain Jim Furyk named Stricker as a non-playing vice-captain for the 2018 Ryder Cup team. The U.S. lost 17 1/2 to 10 1/2 to the European team.\n\nIn 2019, Stricker won his first senior major championship at the Regions Tradition, claiming a six stroke win over the field. Then in June of the same year, Stricker won his second senior major at the U.S. Senior Open, again by six strokes over Jerry Kelly and David Toms.\n\nStricker married into a golfing family. His father-in-law, Dennis Tiziani, and his brother-in-law, Mario Tiziani, both played on the PGA Tour. He and his wife, Nicki, have two children.

Gilbert was acquainted with Jack Spicer and Allen Ginsburg, both prominent figureheads of the Beat Movement, but is not considered a Beat Poet; he described himself as a \"serious romantic.\" Over his five-decade-long career, he published five full collections of poetry.\n\nBorn and raised in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania neighborhood of East Liberty, he attended Peabody High School before failing out. Gilbert then worked as a door-to-door salesman, an exterminator, and a steelworker. \n\nHe was admitted to the University of Pittsburgh due to a clerical error and graduated in 1954. During these college years he and his classmate Gerald Stern developed a serious interest in poetry and writing. \n\nGilbert received his master's degree from San Francisco State University in 1963.\n\nAfter college, Gilbert went to Paris and worked briefly at the \"Herald Tribune\" before moving to Italy. Gilbert spent several years there before moving to San Francisco and then to New York, where his life as a poet began.\n\nHis work has been distinguished by simple lyricism and straightforward clarity of tone, as well as a resonating control over his emotions: “We look up at the stars and they are / not there. We see memory / of when they were, once upon a time. / And that too is more than enough.” His first book of poetry, \"Views of Jeopardy\", (1962) won the Yale Younger Poets Prize and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, and Gilbert was quickly recognized.\n\nHe then retreated from his earlier activity in the San Francisco poetry scene, where he had participated in Jack Spicer's \"Poetry as Magic\" workshop, and moved to Europe. Living on a Guggenheim Fellowship he toured 15 countries as a lecturer on American Literature for the U.S. State Department and lived in England, Denmark, and Greece. Nearly the whole of his career after the publication of his first book of poetry was marked by what he described as \"a self-imposed isolation.\"\n\nHis books of poetry were few and far between; however he continuously maintained his writing and contributed to \"The American Poetry Review\", \"Genesis West\", \"The Quarterly\", \"Poetry\", \"Ironwood\", \"The Kenyon Review\", and \"The New Yorker\". Gilbert was the 1999-2000 Grace Hazard Conkling writer-in-residence at Smith College.\n\nGilbert was also a visiting professor and writer-in-residence at the University of Tennessee in 2004. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, who discovered Jack Gilbert when she succeeded him in the same writing chair, declared, \"He became the poet laureate of my life.\"\n\nOn April 15, 2013 it was announced that Gilbert's \"Collected Poems\" was a finalist for the 2013 Pulitzer Prize in Poetry. The Pulitzer jury's citation read: \n\nMuch of Gilbert's work is about his relationships with women. While in Italy, he met Gianna Gelmetti, a romantic partner who appears frequently in his work. The relationship ended after a year. Gilbert was a close friend of the poet Linda Gregg, whom he met when she was nineteen and his student in San Francisco, and with whom he was in a relationship for six years. Of the poet, Gregg once said, \"All Jack ever wanted to know was that he was awake—that the trees in bloom were almond trees—and to walk down the road to get breakfast. He never cared if he was poor or had to sleep on a park bench.\"\n\nHe was also in a significant long-term relationship with the poet Laura Ulewicz during the late fifties and early sixties in San Francisco. Ulewicz was a great influence on his early work, in fact much of his characteristic style for which he later became known came directly from her, and his first book was dedicated to her. Gilbert also was in a relationship with Michiko Nogami, another former student and a Japanese language instructor 21 years his junior, about whom he wrote many of his poems.

Thus profits or losses for a profit center are calculated separately.\n\nA profit center manager is held accountable for both revenue and costs (expenses), and therefore for profits. This means that the manager is accountable for driving the sales revenue generating activities which lead to cash inflows and at the same time controlling the cost-generating activities. This makes the profit center management more challenging than cost center management. Profit center management is equivalent to running an independent business because a profit center business unit or department is treated as a distinct entity enabling revenues and expenses to be determined and its profitability to be measured. \n\nBusiness organizations may be organized in terms of profit centers where the profit center's revenues and expenses are held separate from the main company's in order to determine their profitability. Usually different profit centers are separated for accounting purposes so that the management can follow how much profit each center makes and compare their relative efficiency and profit. Examples of typical profit centers are a store, a sales organization and a consulting organization whose profitability can be measured.\n\nPeter Drucker originally coined the term \"profit center\" around 1945. He later recanted, calling it \"One of the biggest mistakes I have made\". He later asserted that there are only cost centers within a business, and “the only profit center is a customer whose cheque hasn’t bounced”.\n\n"}

NISP counts each bone and fragment as one unit.\n\nNISP can often be an overestimate of the actual number of individuals at the site, especially when preservation is good but bones are highly fragmented. Multiple fragments of the same bone lead to it being counted multiple times. However, too much fragmentation can lead to an inability to identify a bone as a particular type in the first place. At many sites with poor preservation the total NISP severely underestimates the total possible number of individuals that contributed to the assemblage. Some paleoindian sites, which often exhibit poor organic preservation, are a case in point. However, this and some other problems can be corrected analytically.\n\nA more serious problem is the one of interdependence. There is generally no reliable way to determine if individually counted specimens originated from the same organism on the ancient landscape and are therefore interdependent. Since dependence is generally possible, NISP consistently overestimates, and to some unmeasurable extent, the actual number of individual animals represented in a recovered assemblage.\n\nAn alternative estimate to NISP, often done in concert, is minimum number of individuals (MNI). Both are influenced by fragmentation and limited preservation, but in different ways. NISP tends to overestimate the number of individuals under moderate fragmentation, but the overestimate lessens as fragmentation increases due to the inability to classify the bones. MNI tends to underestimate the actual number under medium fragmentation, and even more severely when bones are highly fragmented. Under hypothetically perfect preservation and no fragmentation, these estimates should be the same. MNI also suffers from the aggregation problem, in which different aggregations will generate at least two values, a MNI minimum and maximum, which are generally empirically indistinguishable. Both NISP and MNI are likely only ordinals scale measurements, which means at best they can only give an ordered series of taxonomic abundance, i.e. \"Taxon A is more numerous than Taxon B.\"\n\nNISP should not be used when calculating a sample size for inferential statistics, because it will inflate the statistical significance. Thus in these situations MNI should be used instead.\n\nLyman, Lee R. (2008) Quantitative Paleozoology. Cambridge: Cambridge UP.\n"}

He has been credited with saving the business from bankruptcy. An acid scar on his face gave Gargantua a snarling, menacing expression, which the circus management exploited by generating publicity falsely exaggerating his purported hatred of humans. He was also claimed to be the largest gorilla in captivity.\n\nGargantua was captured as a baby in Africa, and was known as \"Buddy\" for years. After he was sold to Ringling Brothers by his previous owner, Gertrude Lintz, he was renamed, after François Rabelais's the giant character, to sound more frightening.\n\nHe had a \"mate\" named Toto, but apparently never showed any interest in her. She was nevertheless advertised by the circus as \"Mrs. Gargantua\".\n\nGargantua was born wild in the Belgian Congo in approximately 1929. In the early 1930s, the gorilla was given to a Captain Arthur Phillips as a gift from missionaries in Africa. The captain was fond of him and called him \"Buddy\". He was kept aboard his freighter and became popular with most of the crew. One sailor, however, drunk and seeking revenge on the captain's strictness, threw nitric acid in Buddy's face. This did not kill the gorilla but the attack almost blinded him, left physical scars, and led to much more aggressive behaviour.\n\nUnable to deal with this aggression, the captain gave Buddy to Gertrude Lintz, a wealthy eccentric who looked after sick animals in Brooklyn. Her husband, Dr Bill Lintz, diagnosed Buddy with double pneumonia. Mrs Lintz treated the little gorilla back to health, including chewing his food for him, and along with her kennel-man, Richard \"Dick\" Kroener, trained and raised Buddy. She cared for Buddy, and other apes, as her children and even arranged for plastic surgery on the scar, leaving Buddy with a permanent sneer. She was known to drive around Brooklyn with Buddy, dressed in clothes, in the passenger seat. The arrangement came to an end one night in 1937 when the seven year-old, Buddy, frightened by thunder, broke out of his cage and climbed into bed with his \"mother\" for comfort; Mrs Lintz contacted John Ringling shortly thereafter.\n\nRingling bought Buddy from Mr. Lintz for a sum less than $10,000 ($ in 2020) and renamed him \"Gargantua\" at his wife's suggestion. The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, in financial problems after the Great Depression, heavily advertised their newest attraction. Their extravagant claims included:\n\n\nRegardless of the truth of these slogans, Gargantua attracted millions and single-handedly saved the circus.\n\nA special cage was built for Gargantua by The Crane Company. It was air-tight and air conditioned, designed to keep Gargantua in and the spectators' diseases out.\n\nAnother source attributes construction of Gargantua's special climate-controlled cage to the Carrier Corporation: \"Gargantua's cage, a 20-foot-long steel and plate glass climate-controlled box constructed at a cost of $20,000 by the Carrier Corporation, became as celebrated as its occupant, and was paraded around the ring at every performance.\"\n\nHis first public appearance was in April 1938 and was recorded by \"Time\" magazine: \"Appearing as Display No. 14 on the 26-item program, Gargantua was hauled round & round the Garden in a heavily barred, thickly glassed, air-conditioned wagon drawn by six white horses. Stocky & truculent, he stared menacingly out of his cage, was characterized by Frank Buck as \"the most ferocious, most terrifying and most dangerous of all living creatures.\"\" \nGargantua's supposed aggression and violence were emphasized in the Circus' publicity. For example, \"Time\" magazine also wrote this earlier in the same year:\n\n\"\"Gargantua the Great, wrote Gargantuan Columnist Heywood Broun three weeks ago, \"is the fiercest looking thing I have ever seen on two legs. And probably his power and truculence were all the more impressive because he did look a good deal like a distant relative. No one was allowed to go close to his cage, because Gargantua can reach about five feet through the bars and get a toe hold on a visitor whom he dislikes.\" Gargantua may not be the world's biggest captive gorilla—since the death of Berlin Zoo's monster, many zoos have claimed that honor for their gorillas—but he is one of the most vindictive. Last week the circus' executive vice president, young John Ringling North, nephew of the late John (\"Three-Ring\") Ringling, was inspecting the circus' Sarasota, Fla. winter quarters. Imprudently disregarding warning signs, he leaned against the bars of Gargantua's cage to rest. Gargantua reached through, got no toe hold but wrenched Circusman North's left arm into the cage, bit & wrung it until Trainer Richard Kroner, pounding the gorilla with an iron stake, distracted its slow attention.\"\n\nIn 1941, he was paired with another gorilla, Toto (short for \"Mitoto\" or \"M'Toto\"), who was advertised as \"Mrs Gargantua\". Nothing ever came of the relationship, however, and both lived in separate cages.\nIn May 1942, his trainer since babyhood, Richard Kroener, died. As Kroeners' assistant Julius Gerlick had just been drafted, this left Gargantua to be trained by strangers.\n\nGargantua died in November 1949 of double pneumonia. A necropsy performed at Johns Hopkins Hospital revealed that Gargantua had been suffering from several conditions at the time of his death, including skin disease and four impacted and rotten wisdom teeth.\n\nHis skeleton was donated to the Peabody Museum in 1950, but it is now only displayed on special occasions.\n\nSources report Gargantua's weight variously as -. The seven-year-old Gargantua was described as when first displayed. His standing height was said to be 1.68 m (5 ft 6 in). Lowland Gorillas usually only reach in the wild.\n\nThe film \"Buddy\", starring Rene Russo, is very loosely based on the early life of Gargantua/Buddy and another of Mrs Lintz's gorillas, Massa.\n\n\n"}

It climbs to a height of 98 metres (320 feet) above sea level near Tetford, and, on a fine day, provides a view of the hamlets, fields, hills and landmarks of the area, such as Lincoln Cathedral, Boston Stump and the North Sea.\n\nThe route is marked on the \"Landranger No 122\" (Skegness Area) Ordnance Survey map.\n\nThe route is thought to have been developed by the earliest Celtic settlers of the region and used as a drove road for moving livestock. The primary evidence for this is the route's width compared to nearby routes and its relative distance from existing settlements of the time.\n\nThe route continued to be used by the Romano-British, sometimes closely following the original Celtic route and sometimes deviating from it. Between Ulceby and approximately Skendleby the road was straightened by the Romans and formed part of the Roman Road between Lincoln (Lindum Colonia) and the ancient coast around Wainfleet, Burgh le Marsh and Skegness. This Roman Road deviates from the Bluestone Heath Road around Ulceby but runs parallel to it about a mile to the south until it reaches the Tetford/Belchford area.\n\nThere is a disputed claim that the road was used as a munitions store during World War II due to its proximity to a number of air fields, together with a local legend that a German Doodlebug or V-2 rocket landed on Tetford Hill but never detonated.\n\n"}

The explosion killed 33 and wounded 69 others when the building collapsed. It is one of the deadliest disasters to have occurred on the island.\n\nThe explosion occurred at about 8:35 a.m. on Thursday, November 21, 1996 in the middle of a bustling commercial sector of Río Piedras. The six-story building that housed the Humberto Vidal shoe store, a jewelry store, a music shop store and the head offices of Humberto Vidal was virtually destroyed; it was later demolished.\n\nThe immediate theory was that the explosion was caused by a bomb planted by clandestine paramilitaries or even arson because of previous deliberate acrs. However, there was no trace of explosives, nor were there flammable materials an arsonist could have used.\n\nUnited States President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico a disaster area, which ensured the receipt of federal aid to help the victims, including the assistance of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which launched an investigation. San Juan Gas Company, owned by Enron Corporation, denied any responsibility, claiming that the building had no gas service at the time of the explosion.\n\nThe explosion killed 33 victims and wounded 69 others. Most of the victims were inside the building at the moment of the explosion, but others were in the streets surrounding the building. After the explosion, bodies of victims were placed on the pavement in front of the nearby La Milagrosa church, where Cardinal Luis Aponte Martínez administered last rites. \"There were just parts of bodies lying in the street, torsos, bones, cars blasted against the building,\" Police Chief Pedro Toledo said. The owners of the shoe store claimed that they had reported a gas leak to the San Juan Gas Company several days before the explosion.\n\nThe NTSB's investigation revealed that several persons had reported a gas leak in the building in the days leading up to the explosion, complaining about a bad smell in the store's basement. The store had no gas supply, so another nearby gas line appeared to be the culprit. It was discovered that a gas pipe carrying the heavier-than-air propane gas was broken. A few years earlier, a water main was installed below, which bent the pipe in the process. When the pipe had been installed, it was tightly bent, adding to its stress levels. The addition of the water main caused it to break.\n\nThe explosive gas reached the shop basement by migrating around and over pipes, causing the foul odor. However, gas company technicians were unable to detect the gas before the blast. Investigators discovered that holes used to detect gas below ground were only deep when the gas was about down; therefore, there was no way that the gas could be detected in this manner. Perhaps the most crucial error in detection occurred when a technician turned on his equipment while in the building rather than in fresh air as required, causing a failure to detect gas. The ignition source was found to be an air-conditioning switch with heated wiring.\n\nThe San Juan Gas Company vehemently denied responsibility and suggested that the blast could have been caused by sewer gas. However, the lighter-than-air sewer gas collects in the ceiling, while propane collects on the floor. The investigation showed that stored shoes were tossed up by the explosion, meaning that the fuel had to be at ground level. An upward-bent beam was also crucial to determining that the blast had come from below.\n\nThe San Juan Gas Company was sued by the victims' families and owners of the businesses affected. There were a total of 1,500 lawsuits presented. Through the process, the company admitted no wrongdoing. Of all the lawsuits, 725 were settled out of court, while 101 were ruled against the company. The remaining lawsuits were settled in 2002 for $28 million. There was also criticism of the company's training practices, which management promised to rectify.\n\nAccording to a city resolution, all underground gas lines in Río Piedras were removed to avoid further tragedies. The area of the explosion now has a mural in remembrance of those who died.\n\nThe disaster was examined in the \"Puerto Rico Gas Explosion\" episode of the documentary series \"Seconds From Disaster\" on the National Geographic Channel.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2310624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310624", "title": "Extensible Metadata Platform", "text": "Extensible Metadata Platform\n\nThe Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) is an ISO standard, originally created by Adobe Systems Inc., for the creation, processing and interchange of standardized and custom metadata for digital documents and data sets.\n\nXMP standardizes a data model, a serialization format and core properties for the definition and processing of extensible metadata. It also provides guidelines for embedding XMP information into popular image, video and document file formats, such as JPEG and PDF, without breaking their readability by applications that do not support XMP. Therefore, the non-XMP metadata have to be reconciled with the XMP properties. Although metadata can alternatively be stored in a sidecar file, embedding metadata avoids problems that occur when metadata is stored separately.\n\nThe XMP data model, serialization format and core properties is published by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 16684-1:2012 standard.\n\nThe defined XMP data model can be used to store any set of metadata properties. These can be simple name/value pairs, structured values or lists of values. The data can be nested as well. The XMP standard also defines particular namespaces for defined sets of core properties (e.g. a namespace for the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set). Custom namespaces can be used to extend the data model.\n\nAn instance of the XMP data model is called an XMP packet. Adding properties to a packet does not affect existing properties. Software to add or modify properties in an XMP packet should leave properties that are unknown to it untouched.\n\nFor example, it is useful for recording the history of a resource as it passes through multiple processing steps, from being photographed, scanned, or authored as text, through photo editing steps (such as cropping or color adjustment), to assemble into a final document. XMP allows each software program or device along the workflow to add its own information to a digital resource, which carries its metadata along. The prerequisite is that all involved editors either actively support XMP, or at least do not delete it from the resource.\nThe abstract XMP data model needs a concrete representation when it is stored or embedded into a file. As serialization format, a subset of the W3C RDF/XML syntax is most commonly used. It is a syntax to express a Resource Description Framework graph in XML. There are various equivalent ways to serialize the same XMP packet in RDF/XML.\n\nThe most common metadata tags recorded in XMP data are those from the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, which include things like title, description, creator, and so on. The standard is designed to be extensible, allowing users to add their own custom types of metadata into the XMP data. XMP generally does not allow binary data types to be embedded. This means that any binary data one wants to carry in XMP, such as thumbnail images, must be encoded in some XML-friendly format, such as Base64.\n\nXMP metadata can describe a document as a whole (the \"main\" metadata), but can also describe parts of a document, such as pages or included images. This architecture makes it possible to retain authorship and rights information about, for example, images included in a published document. Similarly, it permits documents created from several smaller documents to retain the original metadata associated with the parts.\nThis is an example XML document for serialized XMP metadata in a JPEG photo:\n<?xpacket begin=\"?\" id=\"W5M0MpCehiHzreSzNTczkc9d\"?>\n<x:xmpmeta xmlns:x=\"adobe:ns:meta/\" x:xmptk=\"Adobe XMP Core 5.4-c002 1.000000, 0000/00/00-00:00:00 \">\n</x:xmpmeta>\n\n<!-- whitespace padding -->\n<?xpacket end=\"w\"?>\n\nThis metadata describes various properties of the image like the creator tool, image dimension or a face region within the image.\n\nEmbedding metadata in files allows easy sharing and transfer of files across products, vendors, platforms, without metadata getting lost; embedding avoids a multitude of problems coming from proprietary vendor-specific metadata databases.\n\nXMP can be used in several file formats such as PDF, JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, GIF, PNG, WebP, HTML, TIFF, Adobe Illustrator, PSD, MP3, MP4, Audio Video Interleave, WAV, RF64, Audio Interchange File Format, PostScript, Encapsulated PostScript, and proposed for DjVu. In a typical edited JPEG file, XMP information is typically included alongside Exif and IPTC Information Interchange Model data.\n\n\"For more details, the XMP Specification, Part 3, Storage in Files listed below has details on embedding in specific file formats.\"\n\nThe XMP Toolkit implements metadata handling in two libraries:\n\nAdobe provides the XMP Toolkit free of charge under a BSD license. The Toolkit includes specification and usage documents (PDFs), API documentation (doxygen/javadoc), C++ source code (XMPCore and XMPFiles) and Java source code (currently only XMPCore). XMPFiles is currently available as a C++/Java implementation in Windows, Mac OS, Unix/Linux.\n\n\n\nThe mainstream IPTC Information Interchange Model editing tools also support editing of XMP data.\n\nXMP is a registered trademark of Adobe Systems Incorporated.\nThe XMP specification became an ISO standard and is not proprietary anymore.\n\nInitially, Adobe released source code for the XMP SDK under a license called the \"ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED — OPEN SOURCE LICENSE\". The compatibility of this license with the GNU General Public License has been questioned. The license is not listed on the list maintained by the Open Source Initiative and is different from the licenses for most of their open source software.\n\nOn May 14, 2007, Adobe released the XMP Toolkit SDK under a standard BSD license.\n\nOn August 28, 2008, Adobe posted a public patent license for the XMP. Adobe continues to distribute these documents under the \"XMP Specification Public Patent License\".\n\nXMP was first introduced by Adobe in April 2001 as part of the Adobe Acrobat 5.0 software product.\n\nOn June 21, 2004, Adobe announced its collaboration with the International Press Telecommunications Council. In July 2004, a working group led by Adobe Systems' Gunar Penikis and IPTC's Michael Steidl was set up, and volunteers were recruited from AFP (Agence France-Presse), Associated Press, ControlledVocabulary.com, IDEAlliance, Mainichi Shimbun, Reuters, and others, to develop the new schema.\n\nThe \"IPTC Core Schema for XMP\" version 1.0 specification was released publicly on March 21, 2005. A set of custom panels for Adobe Photoshop CS can be downloaded from the IPTC. The package includes a User's Guide, example photos with embedded XMP information, the specification document, and an implementation guide for developers. The \"User's Guide to the IPTC Core\" goes into detail about how each of the fields should be used and is also available directly as a PDF. The next version of the Adobe Creative Suite (CS2) included these custom panels as part of its default set.\n\nThe Windows Photo Gallery, released with Windows Vista, offers support for the XMP standard, the first time Microsoft has released metadata compatibility beyond Exif.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2310660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310660", "title": "Man at the Crossroads", "text": "Man at the Crossroads\n\nMan at the Crossroads (1934) was a fresco by Diego Rivera in New York City's Rockefeller Center. It was originally slated to be installed in the lobby of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the main building of the center. \"Man at the Crossroads\" showed the aspects of contemporary social and scientific culture. As originally installed, it was a three-paneled artwork. A central panel depicted a worker controlling machinery. The central panel was flanked by two other panels, The Frontier of Ethical Evolution and The Frontier of Material Development, which respectively represented socialism and capitalism.\n\nThe Rockefeller family approved of the mural's idea: showing the contrast of capitalism as opposed to communism. However, after the \"New York World-Telegram\" complained about the piece, calling it \"anti-capitalist propaganda\", an image of Vladimir Lenin and a Soviet Russian May Day parade were secretly added in protest. When these were discovered, Nelson Rockefeller – at the time a director of the Rockefeller Center – wanted Rivera to remove the portrait of Lenin, but Rivera was unwilling to do so. In May 1933, Rockefeller ordered the mural to be plastered-over and thereby destroyed before it was finished, resulting in protests and boycotts from other artists. \"Man at the Crossroads\" was peeled off in 1934 and replaced by a mural from Josep Maria Sert three years later. Only black-and-white photographs exist of the original incomplete mural, taken when Rivera suspected it might be destroyed. Using the photographs, Rivera repainted the composition in Mexico under the variant title Man, Controller of the Universe.\n\nThe controversy over the mural was significant because Rivera's communist ideals contrasted with the theme of Rockefeller Center, even though the Rockefeller family themselves admired Rivera's work. The creation and destruction of the mural is dramatized in the films \"Cradle Will Rock\" (1999) and \"Frida\" (2002). The reactions to the mural's controversy have been dramatized in Archibald MacLeish's 1933 collection \"Frescoes for Mr. Rockefeller's City\" as well as in E. B. White's 1933 poem \"I paint what I see: A ballad of artistic integrity\".\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller Jr., a businessman and member of the Rockefeller family, was heavily involved in the 1930s construction of Rockefeller Center. He wanted to have a mural placed on the lobby wall of the RCA Building (now 30 Rockefeller Plaza), the largest structure in Rockefeller Center. Meanwhile, his wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, was a patron of the socialist Mexican artist Diego Rivera. This had been the case since winter 1931–1932, when Abby purchased many of Rivera's pieces at a Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) show. At the time, Rivera was painting a controversial fresco in Detroit titled \"Detroit Industry\", commissioned by the Rockefellers' friend, Edsel Ford, who later became a MoMA trustee. Rivera had recently been kicked out of Communist Party USA for accepting commissions from wealthy patrons, and his commission for \"Detroit Industry\" did not help improve the Communist Party's views of him.\n\nThe writer Daniel Okrent states that a key event in the mural's conception occurred during a luncheon that Abby Rockefeller hosted in January 1932, at which Rivera was a guest. Abby suggested that a mural by Rivera would be a positive addition to Rockefeller Center. The entire Rockefeller family became close friends with Rivera and his wife Frida Kahlo over the next few months, which would lead to the decision to commission Rivera for the RCA Building's mural. Rivera was given the theme \"Man at the Crossroads Looking with Hope and High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future\", since John wanted the painting to make people pause and think. The historian Alan Balfour writes that the Rockefellers had full knowledge of Rivera's communist activities, but hired him anyway.\n\nRivera was officially commissioned by Todd, Robertson & Todd, the development agents for the complex. The full commission had planned for \"Man at the Crossroads\" to be a three-paneled mural. The two panels to either side, \"The Frontier of Ethical Evolution\" and \"The Frontier of Material Development\", would respectively contrast capitalism and socialism. According to Rivera's verbal description of the planned mural, the center panel would depict a person at the literal intersection of these two ideals (namely, the \"man at the crossroads\").\n\nThe RCA Building lobby's wall had such a prominent position within Rockefeller Center that John and Abby Rockefeller's son Nelson had originally wanted Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso to create the paintings on either side of \"Man at the Crossroads\". Nelson Rockefeller had chosen these artists because he favored their modern style. Rivera's artistic renown made his commission all the more fitting, since it was so prominently located. However, neither of the other two artists were available: Matisse was already completing commissions for Philadelphia's Barnes Foundation at the time, while Picasso never responded to the wire that requested a meeting with \"Pierre Picasso\". Josep Maria Sert and Frank Brangwyn were later hired to paint other murals in their place. Sert would paint murals on the northern corridor, while Brangwyn would paint murals on the southern corridor.\n\nRivera did not agree with principal Rockefeller Center architect Raymond Hood's suggestion that the mural be commissioned exclusively in grayscale colors. Rivera also declined to take part in an artistic competition prior to the announcement of his commission, and he wanted to withdraw from the project when it was announced that neither Matisse nor Picasso would be painting at the RCA Building. He eventually acquiesced after Nelson convinced Hood to remove his grayscale requirement and allowed Rivera to paint \"Man at the Crossroads\" in a fresco format. However, Rivera withdrew again after Sert and Brangwyn were announced as the new artists, calling them \"two inferior painters\". He eventually rejoined the project by fall 1932.\n\nAs part of the contract, Rivera would be paid $21,000 for the work. This was considerably more than the $10,000 he had been paid for \"Detroit Industry\", which he continued painting even as he was negotiating for \"Man at the Crossroads\". According to Daniel Okrent, Rivera did not read the fine print of the contract that he signed, which stipulated that in exchange for the $21,000, Rockefeller Center Inc. would hold full ownership of \"Man at the Crossroads\"; this would lead to a controversy when the work was later removed from the RCA Building.\n\nRivera showed Abby the sketch of his proposed work on November 1932. Nelson and John also looked at the sketch, and Nelson concluded that there was nothing controversial about the planned mural. Rivera and the Rockefellers signed a contract in which they agreed that the sketch was the final plan for the mural, and that the completed work could not be different from what was on that sketch. In March 1933, Rivera traveled from Detroit to New York so he could work on the RCA Building mural. He employed artists from around the world in his six-person crew, which also included the artists Ben Shahn and Lucienne Bloch. Rivera's assistants converted his small sketch to full-size pieces of tracing paper, which would then be painted onto the wall. Also in March 1933, Webster B. Todd, one of the contractors working on the construction of Rockefeller Center, requested sketches of \"Man at the Crossroads\" because he was concerned about the mural's potential controversial effect. Even so, Rivera did not express worry about any potential issues, even expressing pride over his work when \"The New York Times\" wrote a lengthy profile on him on April 2, 1933. The Rockefellers did not show concern either, and the complex's publicist Merle Crowell took credit for the \"New York Times\" article.\n\nRivera's composition depicted many aspects of contemporary social and scientific culture, and as with his other paintings, contained influences from Communism. In the center, a workman was depicted controlling machinery. Before him, a giant fist emerged holding an orb depicting the recombination of atoms and dividing cells in acts of chemical and biological generation. From the central figure four propeller-like shapes stretched to the corner of the composition, depicting arcs of light created by giant lenses anchoring the left and right edges of the space. Rivera described these as \"elongated ellipses\". Within these, cosmological and biological forces such as exploding suns and cell-forms were depicted. These represented the discoveries made possible by the telescope and the microscope.\n\nBetween and beyond the arcs were scenes of modern social life. Wealthy society women were seen playing cards and smoking at the left. Opposite, on the right, Lenin was seen holding hands with a multi-racial group of workers. Soldiers and war machinery occupied the top left above the society women, and a Russian May Day rally with red flags was seen at the right, above Lenin. For Rivera, this represented contrasting social visions: the \"debauched rich\" watched by the unemployed while war raged, and a socialist utopia ushered in by Lenin. Beyond the giant lenses to left and right were depicted figures contemplating the central scene, behind which were gigantic classical statues. The one on the left depicted an angry Jupiter, whose raised hand holding a thunderbolt had been severed by a lightning strike. This comprised \"The Frontier of Ethical Evolution\". The one on the right was a headless seated Caesar. This comprised \"The Frontier of Material Development\". For Rivera these represented the replacement of superstition by scientific mastery of nature, and the overthrow of authoritarian rule by liberated workers.\n\nThe bottom part of the painting was to depict the controlled growth of natural resources, in the form of a variety of plants emerging from their roots, visible in a cut-away view under the soil. This portion of the original mural was never completed, and it exists only in the later recreation of the composition in Mexico.\n\nOn April 24, 1933, the \"New York World-Telegram\" published an article attacking the mural as anti-capitalist propaganda. As a defiant response to the article, Rivera or one of his assistants added scenes of Moscow May Day and a portrait of Lenin to the mural, which had not been apparent in initial sketches. The Rockefellers did not express any visible concern about the mural. On April 28, to ensure that the late addition of Lenin would be undetected, Rivera sent his assistants to make sure that there was no trace of Lenin portrait in the blueprints and outlines for \"Man at the Crossroads\". Rivera thought that if anyone were to check the blueprints, they would not be able to discern the hidden portrait of Lenin unless they looked closely. He believed that his close relationship with the Rockefellers would permit the surreptitious addition of the portrait. The Lenin portrait would still have gone unnoticed if not for a mistake made by workmen applying a final coat of paint to the wall above Rivera's mural. Some of the paint dripped onto the mural, and when Raymond Hood went to examine the drip, he found the portrait of Lenin.\n\nFollowing the discovery of Lenin's portrait, Nelson Rockefeller delayed the mural's planned May 1 unveiling. He wrote to Rivera to request that the painter remove the picture of Lenin. The portrait was the only thing about \"Man at the Crossroads\" that offended the Rockefeller family, despite the presence of other overtly Communist icons such as the hammer and sickle. A letter of reply from Rivera, written on May 6, politely declined the offer to remove Lenin's portrait, but offered to add Abraham Lincoln to the work by way of a compromise. Rivera also said that he would be amenable to adding portraits of other American icons such as the abolitionists Nat Turner, John Brown, or Harriet Beecher Stowe, but he refused to remove the portrait of Lenin: \"Rather than mutilate the conception [of the mural], I shall prefer the physical destruction of the conception in its entirety, but preserving, at least, its integrity.\" Daniel Okrent states that Rivera did not write the letter himself, instead leaving the task to Ben Shahn, the assistant most strongly opposed to Nelson's request to remove the Lenin portrait.\n\nNelson then left the decision about the future of the mural to Todd, Robertson & Todd. Hugh Robertson, one of the firm's principals, had written a reply to Rivera by May 9. In the letter, Robertson wrote that Rivera had deceived Rockefeller Center Inc. in the contract he made with them, and thus, Rivera was compelled to remove the Lenin portrait immediately. However, it was unclear if Rivera understood that the painting belonged to Rockefeller Center Inc. After reading the letter, Rivera went back to his painting.\n\nOn May 10, 1933, as Rivera and his assistants worked on the mural, they were scrutinized throughout the day during what Rivera called \"the battle of Rockefeller Center\". By the evening, Robertson had ordered that Rivera stop all work on the mural. Rivera was paid in full, but the mural was covered in drapery and left incomplete. He was unsatisfied with the monetary payment, saying that he intended to complete the mural: \"I will not change my mural even if I lose in the courts.\" Rivera's net profit from \"Man at the Crossroads\" only amounted to US$7,000 (), a third of his total payment, after accounting for all expenses. He promised to reproduce the mural at any building that asked him to do so. On May 12, two days after the stop-work order was announced, Rivera was also dismissed from a commission at Chicago's Century of Progress exhibition, where he had been hired to paint a mural for General Motors' pavilion. An architect for GM cited the controversy surrounding \"Man at the Crossroads\" as the grounds for Rivera's dismissal.\n\nThe concealment of \"Man at the Crossroads\" was itself controversial. The artist John Sloan, the writer Lewis Mumford, and the photographer Alfred Stieglitz all showed support toward Rivera's position, while the Communist Party was stuck between endorsing a former member or his wealthy patron. The painter Edwin Blashfield supported Rivera's dismissal because the premise of \"Man at the Crossroads\" was contrary to the American government. In May 1933, Rockefeller Center Inc. announced that the mural would \"remain hidden for an indefinite time\". Within days of the stop-work order, artists' groups had drawn up manifestos to demand that Rivera be able to complete his mural.\n\nIn December 1933, Rockefeller Center developer John R. Todd proposed that \"Man at the Crossroads\" be moved to MoMA, and suggested that Rivera could be re-hired to finish the mural. Rockefeller Center Inc. agreed to this proposal, but it was never carried out for unknown reasons. The mural remained covered until February 1934, when workmen peeled the mural off the wall. Rivera said that the mural's destruction \"will advance the cause of the labor revolution\", while Rockefeller Center Inc. simply issued a two-sentence press release saying that the walls had been replastered, resulting in the mural's demolition.\n\nThe destruction caused widespread controversy, with many artists vowing to boycott any future exhibitions or commissions at Rockefeller Center. Ralph Stackpole and Bernard Zakheim created paintings in which figures held up newspapers with headlines alluding to the \"Man at the Crossroads\" controversy.\n\nThe communist New Workers School in Manhattan was one of the entities who protested the destruction of \"Man at the Crossroads\". Its leader Bertram Wolfe was one of Rivera's associates and would later become his biographer. Rivera painted 21 frescoes and gave them to the school as a gift for their protests.\n\nThe protests largely stopped when Robertson released Rivera's previous correspondence about preferring the mural's destruction.\n\nDespite the disagreement over \"Man at the Crossroads\", Nelson Rockefeller still admired Rivera's work, and the two had an amicable relationship. Years afterward, he would collect paintings and loan them to Rivera's art shows. However, according to Daniel Okrent, his mother felt \"betrayed\" by Rivera, and they were not known to see each other again after the dispute had subsided. As a result of the controversy, John Rockefeller saw to it that no artwork would be commissioned for Rockefeller Center without his explicit approval. As for Rivera, Bertram Wolfe wrote that the artist commissioned paintings for movements that opposed the Rockefellers' \"continued rule\".\n\nAfter \"Man at the Crossroads\" was demolished, Brangwyn was asked to exclude Jesus Christ from his own mural in the RCA Building's lobby, which depicted the Sermon on the Mount. Todd reportedly made the request because Christ could have been depicted in many different ways, but unlike with \"Man at the Crossroads\", there was very little controversy. Brangwyn wrote to John Rockefeller to ask for reconsideration of this request. Brangwyn's mural, completed in December 1933, ultimately featured a depiction of Christ with his back turned. At the mural's unveiling, Todd said that Rockefeller Center management had not cajoled Brangwyn in any way.\n\nMeanwhile, replacements for \"Man at the Crossroads\" were being considered, and Rockefeller Center Inc. approached many artists for possible offers Initially, Picasso showed interest in the commission, but Todd declined the offer because Picasso refused to show a preview of what he was going to paint, and because Picasso would not negotiate from his stated price of $32,000. In 1937, Sert agreed to paint the replacement mural for $27,000. The mural, titled \"American Progress\", depicts a vast allegorical scene of men constructing modern America, and contains figures of Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. \"American Progress\" wraps around the west wall of 30 Rockefeller Plaza's Grand Lobby.\n\nConcerned that Nelson Rockefeller would destroy the work, Rivera had asked Lucienne Bloch to take photographs of the mural before it could be destroyed. In late 1933, Rivera went to Mexico City and persuaded the Mexican government to let him repaint the mural on a blank wall at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. In his biography of Rivera, Bertram Wolfe stated that the artist did not care for the location of the mural this time around. Rather, Wolfe wrote, Rivera had been \"looking for a public place where he could let men see what kind of painting it was that these 'patrons of the arts' had chosen to destroy\".\n\nUsing the photographs as a reference, Rivera repainted the mural, though at a smaller scale, where it was renamed \"Man, Controller of the Universe\". The composition was almost identical, but the central figure was moved slightly to be aligned with the supporting mast of the cylindrical telescope above him. The new version includes a portrait of Leon Trotsky alongside Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels at the right. Others appear at the left, including Charles Darwin. Beside Darwin is John Rockefeller, Jr, a lifelong teetotaler, drinking in a nightclub with a woman. Above their heads is a dish of syphilis bacteria.\n\nThe Rockefeller–Rivera dispute has become an emblem of the relationship of politics, aesthetics, creative freedom and economic power. Some works dramatized the incident, and a few went so far as to lampoon it. The American poet Archibald MacLeish's 1933 collection \"Frescoes for Mr. Rockefeller's City\" was inspired by the incident. It included six poems about the mural in which both Nelson Rockefeller and Rivera were criticized. \"The New Yorker\" published E. B. White's poem \"I paint what I see: A ballad of artistic integrity\", an imaginary debate between Nelson Rockefeller and Rivera, on May 20, 1933. The incident has also been dramatized in the American films \"Cradle Will Rock\" (1999) and \"Frida\" (2002), both set in the 1930s.\n\nOther works focused specifically on Nelson Rockefeller's and Diego Rivera's conduct during the dispute over \"Man at the Crossroads\". In her 1983 biography \"\", Hayden Herrera mentions that Kahlo wrote, \"one could fight against [the Rockefellers] without being stabbed in the back\". This referred to Rockefeller and Rivera's continued relationship even after the controversy had passed. Cary Reich writes in \"The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller\" that the controversy was an instance of Nelson's \"princely tendency [...] to have surrogates handle his dirty work\".\n\n\n"}

The player, represented by a pair of eyes, must navigate the haunted mansion of the late Zachary Graves to recover the three pieces of an urn. The game has been identified as one of the earliest examples of the survival horror genre by a GameSpy article.\n\nThe house has three floors and a basement. The player's character may pick up only one of three items at a time (a key to open doors, a sceptre to ward off evil spirits, or the urn) and must avoid a bat, a tarantula, and the ghost of Mr. Graves himself. If the player is hit by the monsters nine times, the game ends. If the player escapes the house with the urn, the player wins.\n\nThe items (and house layout in higher difficulties) can only be seen when the player uses the 'fire' button on the joystick to light a match, illuminating a small radius directly around his character; this can be done an infinite number of times, although the match only lasts for a limited amount of time before being snuffed out. If a monster enters the same room as the player, a howling wind from the monster will blow out any lit match.\n\nHaunted House has a total of nine different levels which make the game more challenging; in particular, later difficulty levels make the walls of the house itself invisible unless the player lights a match.\n\n\"Electronic Games\" in 1983 stated that \"Haunted House\"s graphics were \"on the simple side, but the effect of creeping through the darkened rooms is very well done\".\n\nRichard A. Edwards reviewed \"Haunted House\" in \"The Space Gamer\" No. 54. Edwards commented that \"There are no drawbacks that come immediately to mind about \"Haunted House\". This is a sure winner and should be spirited away from your nearest store.\"\n\nIn a 1993 review, \"Digital Press\" gave the game 6 out of 10, and called it \"the dinosaur of the SCARY genre\" but said it is not a bad game.\n\nIn 2010, a sequel by the same name was released by Atari who revamped \"Haunted House\" with updated graphics for Windows, the Wii, and Xbox Live Arcade. It was released for Windows on September 28, 2010, for the Wii on October 5, 2010 and on Xbox Live Arcade on October 28, 2010.\nThe game takes place 30 years after the original protagonist was implied to have mysteriously vanished inside the mansion, with his grandchildren searching for him inside the mansion.\n\nAn unofficial sequel to the game, titled \"Return to Haunted House,\" was one of the several built-in games included in the second rendition of the Atari Flashback, a line of plug-and-play game systems. It used Adventure's source code and graphics and was not included on any other Atari Flashback releases.\n\nA new installment of the series, titled \"Haunted House: Cryptic Graves\", was announced on September 1, 2014 and was released on November 25, 2014 for the Microsoft Windows.

Following closure it became notable for being deconstructed in a top-down approach, the building appearing to shrink in height over time.\n\nThe original hotel, opened in 1955, was located in the Kitashirakawa Palace, built in 1930 as the residence of Yi Un, the last crown prince of Korea. The newer tower building designed by architect Kenzo Tange and completed in 1982 was 40 storeys tall and laminated in aluminium. Because of its proximity to Nagatachō Station and the National Diet buildings, it was often used by Japanese politicians for meetings and press conferences.\n\nFor most of its life, the hotel operated as the Akasaka Prince Hotel, but in 2007 the hotel was renamed Grand Prince Hotel Akasaka following the reorganization of the Prince hotel group.\n\nWhen its closure was scheduled, Akasaka Prince Hotel tower was relatively new, being expected to last further decades with proper maintenance and renovation, it was one of the buildings that \"fell victim to the vagaries of commercial real estate here, where high property values, changing design standards and other factors have conspired to create a bull market for demolition\". It had low ceilings like many office contemporaries built in the 1970s during the country's economic boom (height standards were increased in the 1990s to accommodate information technology infrastructure). In recent years it faced competition from upscale hotels run by foreign companies.\n\nAlthough it closed as a hotel in March 2011, after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the Akasaka Prince Hotel housed evacuees from Fukushima prefecture.\n\nThe hotel closed in March 2011 for demolition.\n\nThe top floors of the building were used as a working space for deconstruction, and these are gradually jacked down and lowered as each intermediate floor is removed. As of February 2013 the building had shrunk by 30 metres. Regenerative braking is used on the cranes being used to lower disassembled elements down to ground level, which recovers energy and generates electricity for powering aspects of the demolition operation.\n\nThe hotel was replaced by the Tokyo Garden Terrace development, but the historic Kitashirakawa Palace, original home of the hotel, was restored and reopened in 2016 as a function center for banquets and weddings, known as Akasaka Prince Classic House.\n\n"}

The school is situated on a large area of land in the eastern suburb of Marryatville, part of the City of Norwood Payneham and St Peters. First Creek cuts through the school grounds and large gum trees line the property. The school was founded in 1976 during the Dunstan era, from the amalgamation of the Norwood Boys' Technical High School and the Kensington & Norwood Girls' High School.\n\nMarryatville High School's roots go back to 1877, moving through several incarnations until its naming in 1976 as a co-educational high school:\n\nThe Norwood Model School was opened on the east side of Osmond Terrace (between the Parade and Beulah Road) in response to the 1875 Act which provided for State funding of school buildings and compulsory education for children aged 7 to 13. With the establishment of Norwood High School in 1910, it continued as a \"Central School\" until they were abolished in 1940, at which point it became a Junior Technical School.\n\nThe Junior Technical School continued to expand at the Osmond Terrace site, and in 1944 the Education Department bought 20 acres on Kensington Road at Marryatville. In 1947 Premier announced that classrooms and workshops would be built at Marryatville, and in 1950 tenders were called and work began. The workshops were opened in 1953. enrolments increased rapidly through the 1950s.\n\nNorwood Boys Technical School was officially opened in 1961 and the school continued to expand. In 1964 the school enrolment was 695 boys, 784 students attending night classes, and the Astronomical Observatory opened. enrolments peaked in the low 700s in the late 1960s, but by 1972 this had dropped to 316 and it was announced that the school would be converted to a comprehensive high school.\n\nThe school was renamed in 1974 with an enrolment of 290. In 1975 it was announced that the school would amalgamate with the Kensington & Norwood Girls' High School.\n\nMarryatville High School, known colloquially, by the school referring to itself and by others in reference to its sports teams, etc. as MHS, formed in 1976 with a focus on a special music program, which it maintains today. The first principal was Glen McArthur, who served in the position till 1991, by which time the school had a well-established reputation and enrolment.\n\nSevere floods in November 2005 overflowed the banks of First Creek and caused some damage to the school.\n\nMarryatville High School was accredited as an international school by the Council of International Schools in 2003 and formed a number of sister school relationships in France, Japan and China. The school specialises in particular subject areas, including music, drama, languages and tennis.\n\nOne of the school's main focuses is music, as the school is one of four Specialist Interest Music Schools in South Australia. The Marryatville High School big bands have also won music competitions around the country, notably at Generations In Jazz several times over recent years. In 2007, the Concert Choir won the SA state final of the inaugural ABC Classic FM Choir of the Year Competition and second place in the national final, and won the Children's and Youth Choir section of the 10th International Choir Festival \"Tallinn 2007\" in Estonia. \n\nThe school provides two types of music education in the junior high school, known as \"Music I\" and \"Music II\". The Music I program is less intense than \"Music II\", with only 5 lessons of music a week while \"Music II\" has 10 lessons. \"Music II\" is aimed at musicians with professional music potential, and includes lessons in Musical Development, Theory and Composition, Music Experience, Concert Practice and Choir.\n\nThe Performing Arts Centre, named \"The Forge\", is able to showcase drama, dance and musical performances. For the official opening of the school's theatre in 2005, a production by drama students was presented to guests including then South Australian Premier Mike Rann and state member for Norwood Vini Ciccarello. When talking to the cast and crew after the opening show, Mr Rann exclaimed, \"I've never seen anything this good, at either a High School, University or TAFE\". The drama department performs year level performances for students in year 10, 11 and 12, as well as putting on a Fringe performance in term 1, that for the first time in 2018, included a class of dancers, led by Ms K Cornish.\n\nMarryatville High not only has an international student program, but has a large influence on languages for students. All students in year 8 do a language for the year, one of the three, Chinese, French or Japanese, and are then given the choice to continue languages later during their high school life. The language staff include 2 Japanese teachers, 2 Chinese teachers, and 4 French teachers.\n\nMarryatville High School also has a strong tennis program for students who are chosen by the school when they are in years 6 and 7. Each year level contains an average of 7 tennis students. These students sturdy tennis as a subject, with the history and analyse of technique, as well as practice lessons during, before and after school. The tennis program is taught by PE teachers and previous scholars and participates in many state and national competitions.\n\nEden Park, a grand two-storey Victorian house, is now used as the high school's Year 12 campus; the timber stables have been converted into a music centre. In 2005 Marryatville's Performing Arts Centre, The Forge, was opened. It serves as a performance area for year 11 and 12 Drama Productions and is also used by outside theatre groups. There is also a large gymnasium.\n\n\n\nThe film \"Hey Hey It's Esther Blueburger\" (2008) included several scenes filmed at the school.\n\n"}
{"id": "2310698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310698", "title": "Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo", "text": "Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo\n\nThe club name of \"Consadole\" is made from \"consado\", a reverse of the Japanese word and the Spanish expression \"Ole\".\n\nUnlike other teams, their main home ground at Sapporo Dome is also used by the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters baseball team, so some home games are moved to Sapporo Atsubetsu Stadium.\n\nConsadole's club tradition dates back to 1935 when Toshiba Horikawa-cho Soccer Club was founded in Kawasaki, Kanagawa. They were promoted to the now-defunct Japan Soccer League Division 2 in 1978. They adopted new name Toshiba Soccer Club in 1980 and were promoted to the JSL Division 1 in 1989. Their highest placement, 4th in the 1990 and 1991 seasons. Relegating themselves as they were not ready for J.League implementation, they joined the newly formed Japan Football League in 1992 and played the last season as Toshiba S.C. in 1995.\n\nThey sought to be a professional club but the owner Toshiba did not regard Kawasaki as an ideal hometown. This was because Verdy Kawasaki, one of the most prominent clubs at that time, was also based in the city, which Toshiba apparently believed was not big enough to accommodate two clubs. (Verdy has since crossed the Tama River to be based in Chōfu City in the west of Tokyo and has been renamed as Tokyo Verdy 1969; the only remaining professional club is Kawasaki Frontale, originally part of Fujitsu.)\n\nThey decided to move to Sapporo where the local government and community had been keen to provide a base for a professional soccer team as they awaited Sapporo Dome to be completed in 2001. The ownership was transferred from Toshiba to Hokkaido Football Club plc. before the start of the 1996 season.\n\nToshiba does not have financial interest in the club any more but Consadole still boasts their forerunner's red and black colours on their uniform.\n\nConsadole Sapporo inherited the JFL status from Toshiba S.C.. Their debut season in 1996 was not overly successful as they finished 5th and missed promotion. However, they won the JFL championship in 1997 and were promoted to J.League.\n\nIn 1998, their first J.League season saw them finish 14th out of 18 but this did not guarantee them staying up. From the 1999 season, the J.League had 2 divisions and the play-offs involving five teams (four J.League sides and the champions of the JFL) were to be played. In order to decide who were involved in the play-offs, not only the results of the 1998 season but also those of the 1997 were taken account of. Consadole, who did not play in the previous season, was placed 14th in the aggregate standing and despite finishing above Gamba Osaka (who had finished 4th in 1997), was forced to face the play-offs. They lost all four games, two against Vissel Kobe, and another two against Avispa Fukuoka, and became the first-ever J.League side that experienced relegation.\n\nIn 1999, Takeshi Okada, the former Japan national team coach, was appointed as head coach in an effort to make an immediate comeback to J1, but this attempt failed as they finished 5th. Their heavy investment on players counted against them and, at this point, the debt owed by the club exceeded 3 billion yen (US$33 million). The bankruptcy looked a near-certainty.\n\nIn 2000, they cut costs dramatically. As a result, the team often included as many as eight on-loan players in the starting line-up. However, this strategy paid off and the club won the J2 championship as well as promotion to J1. The club posted a single-year profit for the first time in their history this year.\n\nIn 2001, they finished 11th in J1. However, at the end of the season, the club failed to persuade Okada to renew the contract and several leading players also left the club. In 2002, they finished bottom and were relegated to J2 for a second time.\n\nIn 2003, they again tried to return to the top-flight immediately by investing heavily but the team didn't perform well on the pitch. They finished 9th and their debt again crossed the 3 billion yen mark.\n\nThe deficit-ridden club realized they needed a drastic restructuring and released highly paid leading players including mainstay Yasuyuki Konno. The rejuvenated but inexperienced team finished bottom of J2 in 2004. The bright side was their improved financial situation where the debt was sharply reduced to less than 100 million yen.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, they finished 6th. In 2007 they finally earned promotion as champions and play in J1 in the 2008 season.\n\nA loss on October 19, 2008 confirmed Sapporo's relegation to J2 for the 2009 season, overtaking Kyoto Sanga as the league's most relegated side. Having won the Japanese second-tier championship a record 5 times (including two JSL Second Divisions as Toshiba, and one former JFL title), they were promoted to Division One after finishing third in 2011. However, a torrid 2012 season ended with Consadole holding the highest goals conceded per game ratio, the worst points per game ratio and the highest loss percentage in J.League history as they were relegated after just 27 matches played, making the 2012 team one of the worst to have ever featured in the top division.　From the 2016 season, the club has adopted the new name as \"Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo\".\nIn 2016, Club changed name to Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo.\n\nOn Feb. 9, 2018, the team won the inaugural Pacific Rim Cup tournament in Honolulu, Hawaii, defeating the Vancouver Whitecaps 1–0. 2018 was the season they reached their highest placing in the J.League era and in Sapporo – 4th, 27 years after achieving the same place in Kawasaki.\n\n\n\n\"As of 1 June 2020\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Captain Tsubasa manga series, two characters were from Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo. The midfielder Hikaru Matsuyama and the forward Kazumasa Oda. In 2017, Matsuyama became an Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo player and also an official ambassador of the team from Hokkaido.\n"}

He was a warring ruler, and constantly moved about the frontiers of his dominions. He was hailed \"Yanai Katchai\" meaning 'the One with an Eye-sight Like an Elephant'.\n\nAccording to early Tamil literature, Mantharan Cheral was a contemporary of famous Pandya ruler Nedum Chezhian (II, early 3rd century CE). \"Purananuru\" tells that he participated in the battle of Talaiyalam-Kanam allied with Chola ruler Killivalavan and five other small rulers including Ezhini, Thithiyan, Irungo Vaenman, Porunan and Erumaiyuran against Nedum Chezhian. However, the Pandyas invaded the Chera country, won the battle and Mantharan Cheral was taken as a prisoner to Madurai. After his court trial at Madurai he was locked in a fort \"inside a bamboo forest surrounded by the crocodile lake\". Mantharan Cheral later escaped from his cell and returned to his country and \"continued to rule his loving people in peace, plenty and harmony for many more uninterrupted years\".\n\nThe Chola ruler was also at war with Mantharan Cheral, and Thervan Malayan chief of Miladu is said to have assisted the Cholas in these battles. Kurunkozhiyur Kizhar, a poet in the Mantharan Cheral's court, praises the king for having once saved a city called Vilamkil from the enemies.\n\nThe poet Kurunkozhiyur Kizhar and Kudalur Kizhar who were present at the death of Mandaran Cheral state that the death was portended by a falling star (possibly a comet) seven days previous to the occurrence.\n\nThe mentioned brightly visualised comet that appeared in the said month of March and April might have been the Halley's comet of 141 CE (February–April) under the Aries across \"Phalguna\". \n"}

The unbroken yolk causes the drink to bear a texture similar to that of an oyster. The concoction has been referred to as a traditional cure for hangovers, and has appeared in media for decades.\n\nA nourishing item known as \"kai luak\" (ไข่ลวก) is served commonly at breakfast in Thailand. It consists of soy sauce and pepper atop a soft-boiled egg in a shot glass.\n\nThough considered a traditional hangover remedy, the prairie oyster has not been scientifically proven to treat hangover symptoms. Headache experts say that a prairie oyster will not work as a remedy for a hangover.\n\nIt has been suggested that the raw egg in a prairie oyster may alleviate the symptoms of a hangover since eggs contain cysteine, an animo acid which helps the body break down acetaldehyde, a by-product of processing alcohol. However, there is no reliable evidence showing that consuming foods with this amino acid relieves hangover symptoms. Furthermore, research shows that amino acids in raw eggs are less digestible than amino acids in cooked eggs.\n\nIt has also been suggested that a prairie oyster may seem to relieve hangover symptoms by acting as a distraction and a placebo.\n\n\n"}

Galveston ISD also serves unincorporated areas of Galveston County, including the communities of Port Bolivar and Crystal Beach on the Bolivar Peninsula.\n\nEach Galveston ISD house or residential area is assigned to an elementary school and a middle school. In Port Bolivar, the houses and residential areas are zoned to a K-8 center. All high school students in Galveston ISD attend Ball High School.\n\nGalveston College serves the catchment area of Galveston ISD.\n\nIn 1881, the citizens of Galveston, authorized by the legislative act of 1879 which specified that all cities of a certain size could initiate and maintain their own school system, organized a public school district and elected a board of trustees. Some 20 teachers were employed to teach students in grades one through seven. Prior to this time, all education in Galveston was private or parochial.\n\nIn the summer of 1883, a local dry goods businessman, George Ball, offered to finance construction of new schools. Ball's offer was accepted, and the cornerstone for what would become Ball High School was laid on February 15, 1884. Ball died on March 11, 1884 without seeing his gift completed.Ball High School opened its doors to 200 pupils on October 1, 1884, with a building consisting of 12 classrooms, two offices and an auditorium. According to Gary Cartwright's \"Galveston, A History of the Island\", two alderman pressured the school board to open the new school to all races. At first, the school board agreed to do that, but changed its mind when Ball's heirs offered to give another $10,000, if the high school was only for white students. Susan Wiley Hardwick's \"Mythic Galveston: Reinventing America'a Third Coast\" documents that Central High School was opened as a high school for black students in a storefront in 1885. Central High and Ball High merged into one high school in 1968.\n\nPublic schools in Galveston were operated by the city from 1884 until 1949, when Galveston ISD was established by the Texas Legislature.\n\nIn the 2000s skyrocketing home prices created by the completion of many high-rise projects have forced many middle class Galveston residents to move off of the island to many cities, including Texas City, League City, and La Marque. Galveston ISD's tax base grew by 13% in 2005. Including all students, GISD lost 8% of its students (780) between the 2002-2003 school year and the 2006-2007 school year, with a 7% loss (610) in 2006 The district lost 12% of its students during the same years when Hurricane Katrina evacuees and out-of-district students are excluded.\n\nGalveston ISD lost students to mainland school districts such as Clear Creek ISD and Dickinson ISD. District enrollment fell by 101 students from 2004-2005 to 2005-2006. The district missed 772 students on October 30, 2006. Elementary school enrollment had dropped about 2.3 percent from the 1996-1997 school year to the 2006-2007 school year. If the trend continues for fall 2007, the district would lose 300 students to the newly opened Ambassadors Preparatory School, a charter school, in addition to 94 students, translating to a loss of 10.6% of the district's total elementary school students. At the end of 2006, GISD's total enrollment was about 8,700.\n\nOn January 2, 2007, the \"Galveston County Daily News\" published a report about parents frustrated over plans to close Scott Elementary School. On May 15, 2007, the \"Houston Chronicle\" reported that the League of United Latin American Citizens, in an attempt to prevent schools from closing, filed a complaint with the U.S. federal government asserting that GISD violated a desegregation order. Pat Guseman, an official with Pasa Demographics, predicted that GISD would lose about 1,468 students in the five years after 2007. Guseman said that many of the student losses would originate from the East End of the island. The demographer, characterizing the change in Galveston demographics as \"Hamptonization,\" stated that economically disadvantaged children and Hispanic children are increasing, while African-American children are decreasing, as of 2007. Guseman cited increasing private school enrollment, increasing costs of housing, and a dearth of local employment as reasons for the loss of students in Galveston. During that year, Christine Hopkins, a spokesperson for the district, said that the housing costs and perceptions of GISD schools caused many families to move from the GISD area.\n\nBefore Hurricane Ike hit Galveston in September 2008, GISD had 7,900 students. After Ike hit Galveston, the district lost 25% of its total enrollment. Burnet and Scott elementary schools and Central Middle School received severe damage; the district said the schools would not open in fall 2009. In March 2009 GISD cut 163 positions, including 99 teaching positions; 40% of the total cut positions had already been vacant.\n\nIn the fall of 2009 the district had 6,235 students, 1,665 fewer than the previous year. This was a 20% decrease from pre-Ike. The district had expected 6,000 students to be enrolled during the 2009-2010 school year; it had 235 more than expected.\n\nIn March 2007, Galveston ISD announced that it would introduce plans to change the configurations of its elementary and middle schools within the city of Galveston.\n\nSome parents expressed concern about consolidating the middle schools, because Weis and Central had different student demographics, with Weis having a wealthier student body.\n\nEnding in the 2007-2008 school year, Galveston ISD operates:\n\nAfter spring 2008, Alamo Elementary School would be converted into a multi-purpose center.\n\nStarting in the 2008-2009 school year, Galveston ISD would operate four PreK-4 elementary school and two K-4 elementary schools.\n\nWeis Middle School would become a 5-6 school.

If the district decided to renovate Courville stadium, it would have had to purchase 75 structures, including a church, to build enough parking spaces. Galveston law requires one parking space per of building space, and Courville, which had 140 parking spaces, did not have the sufficient number specified by law; if GISD renovated it, it would have been required to create the legally specified number of parking spaces.

Any function formula_1 that satisfies the property formula_2 is a radial function. The distance is usually Euclidean distance, although other metrics are sometimes used. They are often used as a collection formula_7which forms a basis for some function space of interest, hence the name.\n\nSums of radial basis functions are typically used to approximate given functions. This approximation process can also be interpreted as a simple kind of neural network; this was the context in which they were originally applied to machine learning, in work by David Broomhead and David Lowe in 1988, which stemmed from Michael J. D. Powell's seminal research from 1977.\nRBFs are also used as a kernel in support vector classification. The technique has proven effective and flexible enough that radial basis functions are now applied in a variety of engineering applications.\n\nA radial function is a function formula_8. When paired with a metric on a vector space formula_9 a function formula_10 is said to be a radial kernel centered at formula_11. A Radial function and the associated radial kernels are said to be radial basis functions if, for any set of nodes formula_12\n\n\nformula_17\nis non-singular. \n\nCommonly used types of radial basis functions include (writing formula_18 and using formula_19 to indicate a \"shape parameter\" that can be used to scale the input of the radial kernel):\n\nThese radial basis functions are from formula_20 and are strictly positive definite functions that require tuning a shape parameter formula_21\n\n\n\nThese RBFs are compactly supported and thus are non-zero only within a radius of formula_32, and thus have sparse differentiation matrices\n\nformula_33\n\nRadial basis functions are typically used to build up function approximations of the formformula_34\n\nwhere the approximating function formula_35 is represented as a sum of formula_36 radial basis functions, each associated with a different center formula_37, and weighted by an appropriate coefficient formula_38 The weights formula_39 can be estimated using the matrix methods of linear least squares, because the approximating function is \"linear\" in the weights \"formula_39\".\n\nApproximation schemes of this kind have been particularly used in time series prediction and control of nonlinear systems exhibiting sufficiently simple chaotic behaviour, 3D reconstruction in computer graphics (for example, hierarchical RBF and Pose Space Deformation).\n\nThe sumformula_34can also be interpreted as a rather simple single-layer type of artificial neural network called a radial basis function network, with the radial basis functions taking on the role of the activation functions of the network. It can be shown that any continuous function on a compact interval can in principle be interpolated with arbitrary accuracy by a sum of this form, if a sufficiently large number \"formula_42\" of radial basis functions is used. \n\nThe approximant formula_35 is differentiable with respect to the weights \"formula_39\". The weights could thus be learned using any of the standard iterative methods for neural networks.\n\nUsing radial basis functions in this manner yields a reasonable interpolation approach provided that the fitting set has been chosen such that it covers the entire range systematically (equidistant data points are ideal). However, without a polynomial term that is orthogonal to the radial basis functions, estimates outside the fitting set tend to perform poorly. \n\n\n"}

It is located in the Wanchai Law Courts, Wanchai Tower, 12 Harbour Road. In the past there were six district courts, namely Victoria, Kowloon, , , and , before being amalgamated and moved to the same location in March 1991.\n\nThe District Court has limited civil jurisdiction. For a contract, quasi-contract or tort claim to be handled by the District Court, it should be for an amount over $50,000 but not more than $1 million. If the claim is more than $1 million, the claim can still be pursued in the District Court provided that the excess is abandoned. If the claim is $50,000 or less, an adverse costs order may be made against the winning plaintiff due to pursuing its claim in the wrong court.\n\nEven if a claim does not exceed $1 million, provided that the defendant counterclaims for over $1 million, the claim and the counterclaim or just the counterclaim may be transferred to the Court of First Instance. For good reasons, the District Court may continue to handle the claim when the counterclaim exceeds $1 million, but a report has to be made to the High Court and the High Court may transfer the case.\n\nAs to claims for possession of land, the District Court can deal with buildings or premises the annual rent or rateable value or the annual value of which does not exceed $240,000.\n\nIf a claimant invokes the District Court's equity jurisdiction, the above limits are equally applicable, except that in proceedings related to land, the maximum value shall not exceed $3 million.\n\nDistraint claims are handled by the District Court.\n\nThe system is modelled after the English legal system, with indictable offences being taken up by the District Court if they are transferred from the magistrate's court. A District Court Judge sits alone without a jury.\n\nThe District Court hears all serious cases except murder, manslaughter and rape, and can impose a sentence of up to seven years. Cases are heard in either the Cantonese or English languages.\n\nA person who has practised for at least 5 years as a barrister, advocate, solicitor or judicial officer in Hong Kong or another common law jurisdiction is eligible to be appointed as a Judge, Registrar or Master of the District Court.\n\nDistrict Judges, as well as the Registrar and Masters of the District Court, are appointed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of the independent Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission (JORC).\n\nLimited-term or vacancy-filling Deputy District Judges may be appointed by the Chief Justice.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a person to sit as a short-term Deputy District Judge prior to appointment in a permanent capacity.\n\nIn 1986, Her Honour Judge Helen Lo was the first woman to be appointed as a District Judge.\n\nDistrict judges are mandated to retire at age 65.\n\nThe Chief District Judge is the Court Leader of the District Court.\n\nThe Judges who have held the position of Chief District Judge to date are:\n\nDistrict Judges are referred to as ‘His/Her Honour Judge [surname]’.\n\nThe current Judges of the District Court (as at 3 January 2020) are (ranked according to seniority):\n\nChief District Judge\n\nDistrict Judges\n\nPursuant to a general power of appointment to vacancies or on a temporary basis under sections 10 and 37A of the High Court Ordinance, Cap. 4, the Chief Justice frequently makes short-term appointments of District Court judges to sit in the High Court as a Deputy Judge or Master.\n\nAll District Judges are, by virtue of their office, Presiding Officers of the Lands Tribunal.

{"id": "2310795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310795", "title": "Albion and Albanius", "text": "Albion and Albanius\n\nAlbion and Albanius is an opera, closely resembling a French \"tragédie en musique\", by Louis Grabu with an English libretto by John Dryden.\n\nThe words were written by Dryden in 1680. It was initially intended as a prologue to his opera \"King Arthur\", which he explicitly states in the prologue to that opera. \"But some intervening accidents having hitherto deferred the performance of the main design, I proposed to the actors to turn the intended prologue into an entertainment by itself, as you now see it, by adding two acts more to what I had already written.\" (Dryden's \"Preface\")\n\nThe music was written in 1685. After the period of court mourning for the late King and many other delays, the sumptuous production (costing the company over £4000 to mount) had its premiere on Sunday, 3 June that same year at Dorset Garden Theatre, London. This was \"a very unlucky day\", observes Downes in \"Roscius Anglicanus\", \"being the day the Duke of Monmouth landed in the west: the nation being in a great consternation, it was performed but six times, which not answering half the charge they were at, involved the company very much in debt.\" This fiasco helps explain the rarity of operas in the 1680s, until Londoners had settled down after the Glorious Revolution of 1689. In addition, events of the five years of James's reign quickly rendered the adulatory allegory of Dryden's machinery no longer current.\n\n\"Albion and Albanius\" is the first all-sung and \"full-length\" English opera that still survives, with John Blow's Venus and Adonis being its shorter predecessor by about two years.\n\nIt was written as a tribute to King Charles II, and after his death was intended to apply to his successor James II.\n\nBased in style on a pre-civil war court masque, \"the allegory itself so very obvious that it will no sooner be read than understood\", the hero and his supporters in the plot are mythological and Arthurian; they are, however, quite clearly based on the Stuart dynasty, in a thinly veiled allegory. In terms of production the opera was a restoration spectacular, visuals included much mere mythological display to take advantage of the \"machines\" at the Dorset Garden Theatre, such as \"The clouds divide, and Juno appears in a machine drawn by peacocks: while a symphony is playing, it moves gently forward, and as it descends, it opens and discovers the tail of the peacock, which is so large that it almost fills the opening of the stage between scene and scene\" (Act I). More pointedly political allegorizing of the Tory message includes a figure representing Shaftesbury \"with Fiend's Wings, and snakes twisted round his body; he is encompassed by several fanatical rebellious heads, who suck poison from him, which runs out of a tap in his side.\"\n\nWhen \"Albion and Albanius\" came to be printed, Dryden's \"Preface\" was the first explication of opera in the English language. \"An opera is a poetical tale, or fiction, represented by vocal and instrumental music, adorned with scenes, machines and dancing,\" Dryden informed his readers. The \"machines\" were required to effect the dramatic changes of scenery the action required. Pointing out that the persons were supernatural or heroic, Dryden linked his work with the genre we would call Romance: \"The subject, therefore, being extended beyond the limits of human nature, admits of that sort of marvelous and surprising conduct, which is rejected in other plays... it would follow of necessity, that the expressions should be lofty, figurative, and majestical.\" In this way, at the very birth of opera in London, Dryden gives the character that \"opera seria\" retained for a century, as long as the librettos of Metastasio were being set, into the age of Mozart.\n\nIn the 17th-century Italian operas that Dryden admitted were his general models— and the French ones that he did not mention— the recitative drove the action, and the arias— \"which for want of a proper English word, I must call the \"songish part\"\"— were meant to please the ear rather than gratify the understanding.\n\n"}
{"id": "2310813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310813", "title": "Ilocano literature", "text": "Ilocano literature\n\nIlocano literature or Iloko literature pertains to the literary works of writers of Ilocano ancestry regardless of the language used - be it Ilocano, English, Spanish or other foreign and Philippine languages. In Ilocano language, the terms \"Iloko\" and \"Ilocano\" are different. Generally, \"Iloko\" is the language while \"Ilocano\" refers to the people or the ethnicity of the people who speak the Iloko language.\n\nIlocano literature in the Philippines is one of several regional Philippine literatures. It is one of the most active tributaries to the general Philippine literature, next to Tagalog (Filipino) and Philippine Literature in English.\n\nIlocanos are descendants of Austronesian-speaking people from southern China via Taiwan. Families and clans arrived by viray or bilog, meaning \"boat\". The term Ilokano originates from i-, \"from\", and looc, \"cove or bay\", thus \"people of the bay.\" Ilokanos also refer to themselves as Samtoy, a contraction from the Ilokano phrase sao mi ditoy, \"our language here\".\n\nPre-colonial Iloko literature were composed of folk songs, riddles, proverbs, lamentations called \"dung-aw\", and epic stories in written or oral form. Ancient Ilokano poets expressed themselves in folk and war songs as well as the \"dallot\", an improvised, versified and at times impromptu long poem delivered in a sing-song manner.\n\nDuring the Spanish regime, Iloko poetry was generally patterned after Spanish models. In fact, the earliest known written Iloko poems were the romances translated from Spanish by Francisco Lopez, an Augustinian friar who, in 1621, published his own Iloko translation of the \"Doctrina Cristiana\" by Cardinal Bellarmine, the first book to be printed in Iloko.\n\nA study of Iloko poetry could be found in the \"Gramatica Ilokana\", published in 1895, based on Lopez's \"Arte de la Lengua Iloca\", earlier published in 1627, but was probably written before 1606.\n\nSome Iloko writers credit Pedro Bucaneg, who collaborated with Lopez in the translation of the Doctrina into Iloko, for having been the first known Ilokano poet, and as the \"Father of Ilokano Poetry and Literature.\" Bucaneg, blind since childhood, authored the popular epic known as \"Biag ni Lam-ang\" (\"Life of Lam-ang\") written in the 17th century. The earliest written form of the epic poem was given by Fr. Gerardo Blanco to Isabelo de los Reyes, who published it in \"El Ilocano\" from December 1889 to February 1890, with Spanish translation in prose, and also reprinted it in his El Folklore Filipino, under the title \"Vida de Lam-ang.\"\n\nIlocano literature developed in many ways. During the 18th century, the missionaries used religious as well as secular literatures among other means to advance their mission of converting the Ilokanos to Christianity. The century also saw the publication of religious works like Fr. Jacinto Rivera's \"Sumario de las Indulgencias de la Santa Correa\" in 1719 and the \"Pasion\", a translation of St. Vincent Ferrer's sermons into Iloko by Fr. Antonio Mejia in 1845.\n\nThe 19th century likewise saw the appearance of Leona Florentino, who has since been considered by some as the \"National Poetess of the Philippines\". Her poems which have survived, however, appear to the modern reader as being too syrupy for comfort, too sentimental to the point of mawkishness, and utterly devoid of form.\n\nFr. Justo Claudio Fojas, an Ilokano secular priest who wrote novenas, prayerbooks, catechism, metrical romances, dramas, biographies, a Spanish grammar and an Iloko-Spanish dictionary, was Leona Florentino's contemporary.\n\nIsabelo de los Reyes, Leona's son, himself wrote poems, stories, folklore, studies, and seemingly interminable religious as well as political articles. The achievement of both Claudio Fojas and de los Reyes is possibly more significant than the critical reader of Iloko literature today is ready to admit.\n\nThe comedia, otherwise known as the moro-moro, and the zarzuela were presented for the first time in the Ilocos in the 19th century. The comedia, a highly picturesque presentation of the wars between Christians and Muslims, and the zarzuela, an equally picturesque depiction of what is at once melodrama, comic-opera, and the skit interminably preoccupied with the eternal theme of boy-meets-girl-who-always-live-happily-ever-after-against-seemingly-impossible-odds are still as popular today as they were when first staged in the Ilocos.\n\nThe comedia was scripted from the corridos like \"Principe Don Juan\", \"Ari Esteban ken Reyna Hipolita\", \"Doce Paris\", \"Bernardo Carpio\", \"Jaime del Prado\". Marcelino Mena Crisologo helped popularize the zarzuela based on the culture and tradition of the Ilokanos particularly those in Vigan, Ilocos Sur. So did Pascual Agcaoili y Guerrero (1880–1958) of Ilocos Norte who wrote and staged \"\"Daguiti Agpaspasukmon Basi,\"\" and Isaias R. Lazo (1887–1983) of San Vicente, Ilocos Sur who wrote comedia and zarzuela.\n\nThe year 1892 saw the printing for the first time of the first Iloko novel, written by Fr. Rufino Redondo, an Augustinian friar, titled \"\"Matilde de Sinapangan.\"\" Another Iloko novel which was written before the end of the 19th century by one Don Quintin Alcid was \"\"Ayat, Kaanonto Ngata?\"\" (\"Love, When Shall it Be?\").\n\nArturo Centeno of Vigan, Ilocos Sur, also wrote three novels titled \"Apay a Di Mangasawa?\" (\"Why Doesn't He Get Married?\"), \"Dispensara\" and \"Padi a Puraw Wenno Naamo a Kibin\" (\"A White Priest or a Good Guide\").\n\nThe 20th century was comparatively more intense in literary activity. Some of the literature in this period are \"\"Biag ti Maysa a Lakay, Wenno Nakaam-ames a Bales\"\" (\"Life of an Old Man, or a Dreadful Revenge\") by Mariano Gaerlan (1909); \"\"Uray Narigat no Paguimbagan\"\" (\"Improvement Despite Obstacles\") by Facundo Madriaga (1911); \"\"Mining Wenno Ayat ti Cararua\"\" (\"Mining or Spiritual Love\") by Marcelino Peña Crisologo (1914); \"\"Nasam-it ken Narucbos nga Sabong dagiti Dardarepdep ti Agbaniaga\"\" (\"Sweet and Fresh Flower of a Traveller's Dreams\") by Marcos E. Millon (1921); \"\"Sabsabong ken Lulua\"\" (\"Flowers and Tears\") by R. Respicio (1930); \"\"Apay a Pinatayda ni Naw Simon?\"\" (\"Why Did They Kill Don Simon?\") first known detective novel in Iloko by Leon C. Pichay (1935); \"\"Puso ti Ina\"\" (\"A Mother's Heart\") by Leon C. Pichay (1936).\n\nWhen the \"Bannawag\" magazine, a sister publication of \"Liwayway\", \"Bisaya\" and \"Hiligaynon\", hit the streets on Nov. 3, 1934, Iloko literature reached a headland. Many Ilokanos started to write literary pieces.\n\nThe early \"Bannawag\" short stories showed sustained growth. The short stories written in the 1920s were poor imitations of equally poor American fiction. Early short story writers had practically no literary background in their attempts.\n\nThe growth of the short story was not apparent until \"Bannawag\" resumed publication in 1947. Most of the stories published dealt with themes of war; guerrilla activities, Japanese atrocities, murder, pillage and death. By the latter part of the decade, writers of different ages emerged, and from their ranks came stories that were less verbose, tighter,and with more credible characterization than those written previously.\n\nWhile many articles have been written by Ilokanos and non-Ilokanos about the Ilocos Region, few scholarly studies have been conducted. Among these scholars were Leopoldo Y. Yabes of the University of the Philippines, who made a brief survey of Iloko literature in 1934. His findings showed that Iloko literature began with Pedro Bucaneg.\n\nIn 1940, Thomas B. Alcid of the University of Santo Tomas made a study on the Iloko prose fiction and discussed the Iloko short story and the Iloko novel and their possibilities in Philippine literature. His study showed that the short stories and novels at that time were still young and needed more improvement.\n\nIn 1954, Mercedes F. Guerrero of the Manuel L. Quezon Educational Institution (now MLQU) made a masteral thesis titled \"\"Critical Analysis of the Outstanding Iloco Short Stories Published in the Bannawag from 1948 to 1952.\"\" Her findings showed that the Iloko stories offer a mine of information about the ideals and customs of the Filipino people. In the display of emotions and feelings, the Iloko author has been free or spontaneous in dealing with the life he portrayed. Most often he has been compassionate with his characters. He has treated a wide variety of subjects that there is no important place of Filipino life that has not been depicted. There are stories on mere trifling matters as well as their own nation-slaking subjects. These are stories about persons, about animals, about places and about events.\n\nGuerrero also found out that the Ilokano author served his society by: 1.) Preserving the ideals, customs and traditions of the people. 2.) Bringing out the social consciousness of the era—its mood, conflicts, struggles, and rehabilitation. 3.) Awakening man's sensibilities to the joys, sorrows, loves, hatreds and jealousies of the people. 4.) Casting away sectional sentiments and prejudices and bringing about fuller understanding of the different ethnic groups.\n\nA related literature published by Dr. Marcelino A. Foronda, Jr. in 1967, titled \"\"Dallang: An Introduction to Philippine Literature in Iloko,\"\" discussed the traits and characteristics of the Ilokanos. Of their literature, he stated: \"...The Ilokano language is so highly developed as to have produced the greatest number of printed works in any Philippine language, next to Tagalog.\n\n\"Bannawag\" has played and still plays a major role in the development of Iloko literature. At present, it publishes poems (daniw), short stories (sarita), novels (nobela), essays (salaysay), comics, biographies, folktales and many others including what some call avant garde literary output. It is the only magazine where Ilokano writers hope to publish most of their writings.\n\nDuring the magazine's infancy years in the 1930s, most of its contents were translations from the \"Liwayway\" magazine save a novel by Hermogenes F. Belen titled \"\"Nadaraan a Linnaaw\"\" (Blood-stained Dew) which was serialized in 1947. Other writers at that time included Benjamin M. Pascual, David D. Campañano, Godofredo S. Reyes, Benito de Castro, Jose P. Acance, Benjamin Gray, Marcelino A. Foronda,Jr.\n\nIn the 1960s, poems, short stories and novels published by the Bannawag became better — in craftsmanship, development of plots and themes, among others. Writers by then, most of whom were college students and professionals, had a bigger library of literary books.\n\nTo help in the development of the Iloko short story, \"Bannawag\" launched a writing contest in 1961. The judges were Prof. Santiago Alcantara of the National University, Prof. Angel C. Anden of the Manuel L. Quezon University, and Dr. Marcelino A. Foronda, Jr. of the De La Salle University-Manila. This contest lasted until 1970. One of the judges said the quality of Iloko short stories was competitive with those written in English. Before the martial-law era, most of the poems, stories and novels dwelt on political unrest and protests, like rallies and demonstrations by students, professionals and workers against the government.\"\"'(From an essay by Jose A. Bragado. Bragado is one of the foremost writers in contemporary Ilokano literature. He is a former literary editor of Bannawag magazine and past president of GUMIL, an international association of Ilokano writers.)\"\n\nIlokano writers have also published their works in foreign countries. One of the most popular authors of Ilocano ancestry abroad was the late Carlos Bulosan, a California immigrant born to Ilokano parents in Pangasinan. And currently, the most internationally translated Filipino author is an Ilokano from Rosales, Pangasinan—Francisco Sionil Jose, popularly known as F. Sionil Jose. He is famous for his Rosales saga, a five-novel work about an Ilokano clan, virtually documenting Philippine history from Spanish time to the years of the Marcos administration. The novels, translated in about 22 languages, are circulated and read around the world.\n\nBack home, many Iloko writers have won major prizes in the annual Palanca Awards, the most prestigious and most anticipated of all literary contests in the Philippines. These famous winners' names include Reynaldo A. Duque, Ricarte Agnes, Aurelio S. Agcaoili, Lorenzo G. Tabin, Jaime M. Agpalo Jr., Prescillano N. Bermudez, William V. Alvarado, Maria Fres-Felix, Clarito G. de Francia, Arnold Pascual Jose, Eden Aquino Alviar, Severino Pablo, Ariel S. Tabag, Daniel L. Nesperos, Roy V. Aragon, Danilo Antalan, Joel B. Manuel, Bernardo D. Tabbada, Noli S. Dumlao and others.\n\nClarito G. de Francia expanded his writings by composing songs in English, when he immigrated to the U.S. His first work \"Fil-Am Song\" deals with the pursuit of Filipino-Americans' struggles in the green fields and their triumphs in great cities. This is followed by \"Loyalty for Our Country and Humanity,\" a tribute to America as a sanctuary of migrants. President Barack Obama reacted to this work: \"...We should be proud of what we have accomplished together...It’s the optimism and hard work of people like you that have changed our country for the better...\" After that, come \"Today is Your Special\" a birthday greetings; \"Home Sweet Home\" an upliftment of family togetherness; \"Celebrate a Recommitment\" an anniversary song; \"Live and Share Christ to the World\" for evangelization, etc. These pieces show De Francia's way of encouraging his fellow Filipinos to impart their heritage, culture and traditions to the world. As a bridge for this idea, he has been sponsoring a short story writing contest in English, the DEfrancia Awards for Literature(DEAL), since 2017.\n\nOn October 19, 1968, GUMIL Filipinas (Ilokano Writers Association of the Philippines) was organized in Baguio City. Arturo M. Padua, then mayor of Sison, Pangasinan, was elected president. The officers took their oath of office before President Ferdinand E. Marcos.\n\nGUMIL Filipinas or Gunglo dagiti Mannurat nga Ilokano iti Filipinas, Inc., was incorporated and registered with the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission on January 8, 1977.\n\nGUMIL Filipinas' main objectives are:\n\n\n\"(Excerpted from an essay by Jose A.

{"id": "2310823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310823", "title": "Anthem of the Sun", "text": "Anthem of the Sun\n\nAnthem of the Sun is the second album by rock band the Grateful Dead. Released in 1968, it is the first album to feature second drummer Mickey Hart, who joined the band in September 1967. The album was ranked number 288 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, in both the 2003 and 2012 iterations of the list.\n\nIt was voted number 376 in Colin Larkin's \"All Time Top 1000 Albums\".\n\nThe mix of the album combines multiple studio and live recordings of each song. The result is an experimental amalgam that is neither a studio album nor a live album, but both at the same time (though it is usually classified as a studio album).\n\nDrummer Bill Kreutzmann's description of the production process describes the listening experience of the album as well: \"...Jerry [Garcia] and Phil [Lesh] went into the studio with [Dan] Healy and, like mad scientists, they started splicing all the versions together, creating hybrids that contained the studio tracks and various live parts, stitched together from different shows, all in the same song — one rendition would dissolve into another and sometimes they were even stacked on top of each other... It was easily our most experimental record, it was groundbreaking in its time, and it remains a psychedelic listening experience to this day.\"\n\nThe band entered American Studios in Los Angeles in November 1967 with David Hassinger, the producer of their eponymous debut album. However, determined to make a more complicated recorded work than their debut release, as well as attempt to translate their live sound into the studio, the band and Hassinger changed locations to New York City. By December they had gone through two other studios, Century Sound and Olmstead Studios (both \"highly regarded eight-track studios\").\n\nEventually, Hassinger grew frustrated with the group's slow recording pace and quit the project entirely while the band was at Century Sound, with only a third of the album completed. It has been reported that he left after guitarist Bob Weir requested creating the illusion of \"thick air\" in the studio by mixing recordings of silence taken in the desert and the city. Hassinger commented that \"Nobody could sing [the new tracks recorded in NYC], and at that point they were experimenting too much in my opinion. They didn't know what the hell they were looking for.\" Garcia noted that \"we want[ed] to learn how the studio work[ed]. We [didn't] want somebody else doing it. It's our music, we want[ed] to do it.\"\n\nReturning to San Francisco's Coast Recorders, the band recruited their soundman, Dan Healy, to help produce. In between studio sessions, the band also began recording their live dates. Lesh commented that this was in part because the songs were not \"road tested.\" Healy, Garcia, and Lesh then took these concert tapes (encompassing two Los Angeles shows from November 1967, a tour of the Pacific Northwest in January and early February 1968, and a California tour from mid-February to mid-March 1968) and began interlacing them with existing studio tracks. Garcia called this \"mix[ing] it for the hallucinations\". Kreutzmann explained, \"Phil and Jerry were the ones who figured out that we could exploit studio technology to demonstrate how these songs were mirrors of infinity, even when they adhered to their established arrangements. It's the old paradox of 'improvisational compositions'. Jazz artists knew all about the balance between freedom and structure, but a few rock bands were now catching on. Most rock bands, however, tended to head in an opposite direction, afraid of the uncertainty of improvisation. We decided that \"Anthem of the Sun\" was going to be our statement on the matter\".\n\nTom Constanten, a friend of Lesh and Garcia, joined the band in the studio while on leave from the United States Air Force to provide piano, prepared piano, and electronic tape effects influenced by John Cage. Constanten would formally join the band following his discharge in November 1968; however, his contributions to the band's sound were more evident in the studio than in live shows, and \"Anthem of the Sun\" was no exception. Constanten developed piano pieces that sounded like three gamelan orchestras playing at once and created effects by setting a spinning gyroscope on the piano soundboard. Likewise, the rest of the band used a large assortment of instruments in the studio to augment the live tracks that were the base of each song, including kazoos, crotales, harpsichord, timpani, trumpet, and a güiro. Garcia commented that parts of the album were \"far out, even too far out... We weren't making a record in the normal sense; we were making a collage.\" He also acknowledged the influence of Lesh's study of Stockhausen and other avant-gardists. Warner Bros. executive Joe Smith was noted as characterizing \"Anthem of the Sun\" as \"the most unreasonable project with which we have ever involved ourselves.\"\n\nJerry Garcia's longtime friend and songwriting partner, Robert Hunter, had made his first lyrical contributions to the band the previous year for \"Dark Star\". He added words to the Lesh/Pigpen composition \"Alligator\" on this album.\n\nAs much as the entire album can be seen as an \"Anthem\", it is one of rock music's earliest song cycles, or perhaps concept albums. The front cover art, by Bill Walker, resembles a mandala and incorporates the likenesses of the band members' heads. The back cover features a circular fisheye group shot, photographed by Thomas Weir.\n\nOn the original pressing, all of the songs were credited to the band as a whole. Individual writing credits were subsequently published. In order to increase royalty points on the album, the band divided opening track \"That's It for the Other One\" into four somewhat arbitrary movements. The opening section, the Garcia-sung \"Cryptical Envelopment\", was dropped from live performances of the suite after 1971 (though it reappeared a few times in 1985). The second section, ostensibly a quodlibet (misspelled as \"quadlibet\"), is a short jam connecting to the main section, sung by Weir (\"Spanish lady comes to me, she lays on me this rose\"), with a short reprise of \"Cryptical Envelopment\". Though labeled as \"The Faster We Go, the Rounder We Get\", played live, Weir's section became known simply as \"The Other One\". The final section is a Constanten piece featuring the aforementioned prepared piano and sound effects (this section is missing from the album cover on original pressings).\n\nThe \"Dark Star\" single, released just prior to \"Anthem of the Sun\", is not included on the album, but its B-side, \"Born Cross-Eyed\", is included in a stereo mix, without the \"Feedback\" ending.\n\nEarly pressings of the album include the phrase \"The faster we go, the rounder we get\" inscribed on the vinyl in the run-out matrix around the label area. This was the inspiration for Rounder Records' name.\n\nThe album was remastered for the 2001 box set \"The Golden Road\". This version includes four bonus tracks (the single version of \"Born Cross-Eyed\" plus contemporaneous live tracks) and was issued separately in 2003.\n\nThe making of \"Anthem of the Sun\", \"Aoxomoxoa\", \"Workingman's Dead\", and \"American Beauty\" are described by former members and associates of the Grateful Dead in the 1997 \"Classic Albums\" documentary \"Anthem to Beauty\".\n\nWhile no certain date for the beginning of recording is known, it is unlikely that any material was recorded before September 19, 1967, the date when Mickey Hart first played with the band. The melange of the final product makes it difficult to tell where many of the live excerpts listed in the credits were used. However, significant fragments of \"Alligator\" (e.g. the post-vocals \"jam section\") are known to come from the February 14, 1968, show at San Francisco's Carousel Ballroom (the venue that later became the Fillmore West). The \"Alligator\" vocal reprise is taken from November 10, 1967, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Similarly, the skeletal framework of \"Caution (Do Not Stop on Tracks)\" dates from the Shrine Auditorium on November 10, 1967, and the Carousel Ballroom on March 31, 1968. Excerpts from two shows at Kings Beach Bowl in Lake Tahoe, California, on February 23–24, 1968, that were used — most notably the car horn heard at the end of \"Caution (Do Not Stop on Tracks)\" — were later released on \"Dick's Picks Volume 22\". Another show known to be sourced, from March 17, 1968, was released as \"Download Series Volume 6\". Used from that performance were the verse(s) section of \"The Faster We Go\" portion of \"That's It for the Other One\", and the first half of the \"New Potato Caboose\" jam (after the vocals).\n\nStudios used:\n\nLive tracks recorded at (according to liner notes):\n\nThe February 14, 1968, recording at Carousel Ballroom has been used to create sound patches for Moog Music's award-winning Animoog app.\n\nBonus tracks on the 2001/2003 reissue recorded at:\n\nA remixed version of \"Anthem of the Sun\", supervised by Phil Lesh, was issued in 1972 (with the same product number, WS-1749), and can be identified by the letters RE after the master numbers. The remix particularly differs from the original in terms of segues, use of live recordings, and stereo imaging. For example, the original mix starts with vocals and organ panned wide, while the remix has them centered; Bob Weir's studio vocal on the first track is doubled with a live recording on the original mix and solo on the remix. \"Born Cross-Eyed\" ends with a power chord in the key of E on the remix, whereas the original mix has an earlier fade-out.\n\nAround the same time Jerry Garcia supervised a remix of the Grateful Dead's following album \"Aoxomoxoa\". While the \"Aoxomoxoa\" remix was used for original Warner Bros and subsequent Rhino CD issues, the original mix of \"Anthem of the Sun\" was chosen for CD reissues.\n\nIn 2013 the Grateful Dead studio albums were remastered again for listening in digital high resolution. The 2013 download is the first digital issue of the \"Anthem of the Sun\" early 70s remix. Confusingly, the promotion for this reissue emphasized the use of original mixes (particularly those of the \"Workingman's Dead\" and \"American Beauty\" albums which had been remixed for previous high resolution digital releases). However, \"Anthem of the Sun\" and \"Aoxomoxoa\" appear in the 2013 HD release not in their original mixes, but in remixed form, as released in 1972.\n\nAs remix masters were not sent to the UK, vinyl pressings of the album in this region (and probably other foreign markets) continued to use the original mix after 1972.\n\nWhen the album was reissued in 1975, Warner Brothers changed the background color on the front cover from midnight blue to white, and the stylized title was changed to a standard font. As the band had not approved the change, the following pressings reverted to blue.\n\nOn July 13, 2018 Rhino Records released the \"50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition\" of \"Anthem of the Sun\", on two CDs.

Smith-Cameron, with Amy Irving reprising the role of Sue Snell from the first film. Its plot follows the younger half-sister of Carrie White, also suffering with telekinesis, who finds that her best friend's suicide was spurred by a group of popular male classmates who exploited her for sexual gain. The film is a sequel to the 1976 horror film \"Carrie\", based on the 1974 novel of the same name by Stephen King and the second film in the \"Carrie\" franchise.\n\nThe film was released on March 12, 1999, and received generally negative reviews from critics. The film was a box office bomb at the time of release, grossing $17 million against a $21 million production budget.\n\nIn 1986, as a child, Rachel Lang is placed in foster care when her mother, Barbara, is diagnosed with schizophrenia after she interprets signs of Rachel's telekinesis as possession by Satan. 13 years later in September 1999, Rachel, an outcast, is living with unsympathetic foster parents and attending high school. After her best friend Lisa commits suicide by leaping from a building at the school, it is uncovered that Eric, a popular football star, rejected her after exploiting her for sex.\n\nA devastated Rachel finds a photo of Lisa and Eric kissing while developing rolls of Lisa's film at a photo lab where she works. Rachel turns the photograph into police, and explains that Lisa had confessed to her that she had recently lost her virginity. Sheriff Kelton, along with the school's guidance counselor, Sue Snell, pursue statutory rape charges against Eric, who is over eighteen. It is uncovered that Eric and his football player peers, including Mark Bing, are engaged in a competition to see who can seduce the most girls by the end of the year.\n\nLate one night while driving home, Jesse, another player on the football team, is flagged down by Rachel after her Basset Hound, Walter, is hit by a car on the road. Jesse, who is not as callous as his peers, takes a genuine interest in Rachel, at the behest of cheerleader Tracy, who is pursuing him. Meanwhile, Eric and Mark have discovered that Rachel implicated them in Lisa's death, and they attempt to scare her into not talking by harassing her at her home, but they become victims of her unusually strong telekinetic powers, which frighten them away.\n\nMeanwhile, Sue gradually begins to suspect Rachel may possess telekinetic powers through their counseling sessions. She tracks down Rachel's institutionalized mother, Barbara, whose schizophrenia has stabilized, and Barbara confesses that Rachel's father was Ralph White, the father of Carrie White. Sue subsequently brings Rachel to the ruins of the former high school, which Carrie destroyed in a telekinetic rage in 1976 after being humiliated at her senior prom. Sue, a peer of Carrie's, survived the incident. When Sue discloses that Carrie is Rachel's half-sister, she dismisses her as a liar.\n\nLater, the statutory rape charges against Eric is covered up by the district attorney because of the political influence of the families of the players. In retaliation against Rachel, Mark sets up a romantic getaway for Rachel and Jesse, which he covertly films unbeknownst to them. Monica, the girlfriend of Mark's friend Brad, then befriends Rachel under false pretenses, inviting her to a party after a football game. Rachel leaves with Monica to the party, while Jesse is forced to ride with Tracy after his car's tires are slashed. Tracy stops at her house first and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce him. Meanwhile, Sue manages to sneak Barbara out of the institution so that she can confess Rachel's father's identity to her.\n\nAt the party, Rachel is soon confronted by Mark and Chuck, who reveal their sex game and falsely claim that Rachel was added to Jesse's list of girls he has bedded. They also project the footage of her and Jesse having sex for all of the partygoers to see. This triggers Rachel's telekinesis, and she seals the house closed. She kills most of the partygoers by causing a large glass window to explode, slashing them to death, and also triggers a fire. Meanwhile, Sue and Barbara track Rachel to the party, but Sue is killed by a fire-poker that impales the front door. As Rachel pursues Monica, Eric, and Mark through the house, they arm themselves with weapons. Rachel kills Monica by causing her glasses to implode into her eyes, causing Monica to inadvertently castrate Eric with a harpoon. Mark shoots her with a flare gun and Rachel falls into the swimming pool. When Mark goes over to inspect whether she is dead, Rachel appears out of the water and pulls Mark into the pool. Rachel triggers the sensor to the automatic pool cover, and manages to free herself while Mark drowns.\n\nAn injured Rachel is confronted by Barbara, who initially attempts to comfort her, but proceeds to accuse her of being possessed, and flees. Jesse and Tracy arrive moments later, and Rachel kills Tracy by causing a piece of ceiling to collapse on her. On a balcony, Rachel confronts Jesse about his supposed list, but he denies it. Rachel then notices that the videotape of her and Jesse, still playing in the living room, captured Jesse saying \"I love you\" while she slept. She immediately realizes that Jesse's feelings for her are genuine. Moments later, an awning collapses on Rachel. Jesse is unable to free her, and she uses her telekinesis to throw him over the balcony onto the pool cover as she burns to death.\n\nOne year later in 2000, Jesse, now studying at King's University, shares a dormitory with Rachel's dog Walter. He has a vision of Rachel appearing in his room, and they kiss before she shatters into pieces. He awakens in a panic, realizing the vision was only a nightmare.\n\nOriginally titled \"The Curse\", the film was initially scheduled to start production in 1996 with Emily Bergl in the lead, however production stalled for two years. The plot heavily borrows from a real-life 1993 incident in which a group of high school jocks known as the Spur Posse were involved in a sex scandal. The film eventually went into production in 1998 under the title \"Carrie 2: Say You're Sorry\". A few weeks into production, director Robert Mandel quit over creative differences and Katt Shea hurriedly took over the reins with less than a week to prepare to start filming, and two weeks' worth of footage to reshoot.\n\nAmy Irving reprised the role of Sue Snell, which she originated in the first \"Carrie\", though she was initially wary of taking the role and asked Brian De Palma, director of the original film, for his blessing. Director Shea was told that she would not be able to use footage of Sissy Spacek from the original \"Carrie\", but she edited several scenes into the film and presented the film to Spacek, who granted permission for her likeness to be used.\n\n\"The Rage: Carrie 2\", was released on March 12, 1999. It opened in second place that weekend but was not successful. It grossed a total of $17,762,705 domestically against a $21 million budget, making the film a box office disappointment.\n\nThe film received mostly negative reviews upon its release, with many moviegoers and critics criticizing the film's failure to capture the essence of what made the original so creepy, yet believable. Rotten Tomatoes reported the film had a 20% approval rating based on 35 reviews with the consensus: \"As disposable as its predecessor is indispensable, \"The Rage: Carrie 2\" mimics the arc of Stephen King's classic story without adding anything of value.\" On Metacritic it had a rating of 42 on a scale from 0–100 based on 21 reviews indicating mixed or average reviews.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars stating \"The original \"Carrie\" worked because it was a skillful teenage drama grafted onto a horror ending. Also, of course, because De Palma and his star, Sissy Spacek, made the story convincing. \"The Rage: Carrie 2\" is more like a shadow\". Anita Gates of \"The New York Times\" characterized it as \"typical B-movie making. The actors are attractive and do credible jobs, and in the tradition of the original film, there's one really good scare at the end.\" Dennis Harvey of \"Variety\" panned the film, noting that it \"uses the original as a blueprint, but leaves out all the wit, sympathy and bravado.\"\n\nTy Burr of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a more favorable B-minus rating, praising Bergl's performance and summarizing that the film is \"better than it deserves to be.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" championed the film as a \"well-directed sequel\" that \"accepts the telekinetic gimmick as an obligatory plot device [to] rage against high school machismo.\"\n\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on October 12, 1999 and Laserdisc on November 9, 1999. A Blu-ray version of the film was released on April 14, 2015 in a double feature with the 2002 TV version of \"Carrie\" from Scream Factory. This edition went out of print on October 8, 2019.\n\nThe accompanying soundtrack album was released on March 23, 1999 by Edel Records.\n\n"}

It was first launched in 1935, by Fred Walker.\n\nLD&D Foods (who also held a stake in the company) were the previous operator of the brand, until it was sold back to WCB in May 2015.\n\nCoon cheese is named after its American creator, Edward William Coon (1871–1934) of Philadelphia, who patented a method, subsequently known as the Cooning process, for fast maturation of cheese via high temperature and humidity. Former manufacturer Kraft, and later Dairy Farmers and National Foods, have vigorously defended the trademark.\n\nE. W. Coon was the grandson of Amherst Coon (1795–1877), a farmer born in Russia, New York, who married Sally Betsey Treat in 1822. His sons Mattison (b. 1823) and Ephraim Coon (b. 1832) were described in 1893 as having been in the butter and cheese business together at 29 South Water Street, Philadelphia, for more than thirty years. \n\nEphraim's son Edward Willie Coon was born on 30 July 1871, and had taken out at least one cheese patent by 1912.\n\nIn August 1923, \"The Journal and Republican\" of Lowville, New York, reported the sale by \"E. W. Coon of Philadelphia, maker and shipper of cheese\", of five milk plants in villages around Watertown to the Dairymen's League Co Operative Association, Inc. It also stated that \n\nOn 27 February 1926, Coon filed an application for a Process for Ripening Cheese. Patent No 1579196 was issued on 30 March 1926. Coon's patent claimed:\n\nFrom 1933, a cheese was marketed by Fred Walker as \"Red Coon\", and was coated with red wax. The wax was later replaced with cellophane, and the red stripe in the logo is a residual reference to the original packaging.\n\nAfter selling his processing plants, Edward W. Coon became a cheese dealer in Philadelphia. He died in 1934, aged sixty two. Coon was working at the office in Philadelphia of the Kraft-Phoenix Cheese Corporation at the time of his death, according to \"The Journal and Republican\" in Lowville, New York.\n\nBritish comedian Stephen K. Amos regularly performs a skit on Coon Cheese as part of his live show, due to the word \"Coon\" also being an ethnic slur used for black people in the United States.\n"}

It was first released on 12 July 2004 in the United Kingdom on V2 Records. After releasing several limited-edition singles and the extended play \"Man Bites Man\", the band released the album to critical praise.\n\nThe album reached number 44 on the UK Albums Chart, and was preceded by the singles \"Godhopping\" and \"I Love You 'Cause I Have To\" and \"Lounger\".\n\nDogs Die in Hot Cars were formed when secondary school pupils Craig Macintosh (lead vocals, guitar), Gary Smith (vocals, guitar), Lee Worrall (bass) and Laurence Davey (drums) met whilst attending Madras College in St Andrews, Scotland. The band practiced in Davey's basement, slowly graduating from Nirvana cover versions to original songs. After practicing in Wormit, Fife, the band relocated to Glasgow, adding Ruth Quigley (keyboard, vocals) as the final member. The band released their first single \"I Love You ’Cause I Have To\" on label Radiate, along with \"Celebrity Sanctum\" and \"Somewhat Off The Way.\" The three-track release peaked at number 79 on the UK Singles Chart. Described as \"mix of ska rhythms and new wave pop hooks\" by Allmusic, \"I Love You 'Cause I Have To\" gained enough critical and commercial success to gain a recording contract with V2 Records, and an EP titled \"Man Bites Man\" was released by the band in 2004, including the album track \"Pastimes & Lifestyles.\"\n\nThe band embarked on an extensive promotional tour, including the British Glastonbury Festival and T in the Park, as well as supporting Eskimo Joe on several dates in Australia.\n\nMacintosh has said of the album title,\n\n\"[...] part of the reason why we decided to call the album \"Please Describe Yourself\" [is because] it's like those dating channels: everybody goes, 'from London, happy-go-lucky'; nobody says, 'I’m a manic depressive', or 'I think I’m indescribable'. So we’re kind of throwing the question back.\"\nMacintosh has said that they wanted \"to write tunes where the song would reach its conclusion and you might even want to play it again\" on the record. He also spoke of their willingness to record songs that were \"big already\" and did not need guitar solos, or what he described as \"the new guitar solo\" – rap.\n\n\"Please Describe Yourself\" takes influence from a wide variety of genres. One article in \"The Times\" said \"Dogs Die don’t slot into any one musical genre — their forthcoming album, Please Describe Yourself, covers everything from ska to summer pop to Talking Heads-type rock\", while another said \"Please Describe Yourself ... changes styles so often that it’s hard to keep up. The thread is that all ten tracks are catchy, quirky pop-rock with clever, slightly off-kilter lyrics that tend to take a dig at modern living.\" \"The New York Times\" described the band's style on the album as \"XTC-meets-Dexy's Midnight Runners sound.\" However, the band have claimed that they do not list them as an influence, as \"none of us has ever owned a single Dexys record.\" Heather Phares of Allmusic stated that \"Instead of just beating one style into the ground, on Please Describe Yourself Dogs Die in Hot Cars mine the past of British pop but find relatively fresh ways of rediscovering it.\"\n\nAustralian newspaper \"The Age\" called Craig Mactintosh's vocal delivery \"biting social observations in a BBC-friendly accent.\" Macintosh responded by noting that he was \"frustrated with singers who slurred their words and made it hard to make out what they were saying. I've got things I want to say\", adding that he wanted people to understand the lyrics that mean something to him.\n\nLyrically, \"Godhopping\", the opening track, is about people who change their religion according to what is fashionable. It was released as the album's lead single on 25 May 2004 in the UK. Described as \"a jauntily piano-driven slip of white funk\" by \"The Independent\", the song reached number 24 on the UK Singles Chart, their highest-charting song to date. Speaking of the song's minor success, Lee Worral noted that \"It was 17 midweek, so we were like, 'Wow, we could be on Top of the Pops!' But obviously, later on in the week all the kids get their pocket money and go out and buy Britney Spears or whatever. So 24 was great. See if we can better it with the next one.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Independent\", the second song on the album, \"Lounger\", is \"a song about an overeducated, lazy bohemian\" with lyrics such as \"I get up when I want/Don't have to eat my greens/Or keep my bedroom tidy\" guaranteed to appeal to students. The song was called the album's \"telling moment\" by Pitchfork Media, whilst Stylus said that it \"fizzes along like no-one’s business, guitar on super-jangle and piano set to hyper-jaunty.\" It was released as the album's third single, and reached a peak of 43 on the UK Singles Chart. It was the last Dogs Die in Hot Cars single to chart.\n\nThe third song and second single from the album is titled \"I Love You 'Cause I Have To.\"\n\n\"Celebrity Sanctum\", both the fourth track and fourth single from the album, according to Gareth Dobson of Drowned in Sound, is \"a song about vicarious love and image obsession.\" Dobson called the song, which namechecks celebrities such as Lucy Liu and Catherine Zeta-Jones, \"a moving sense of ennui rather than attempting to play it for laughs\", whilst \"The Age\" said that \"[Cameron is] losing himself in the thrall of icon obsession.\"\n\nThe final single was \"Pastimes and Lifestyles.\" Described as \"the closest the band gets to a fashionably post-punk style.\"\n\n\"Please Describe Yourself\" was critically well received. Allmusic's Heather Phares said: \"on \"Please Describe Yourself\" Dogs Die in Hot Cars mine the past of British pop but find relatively fresh ways of rediscovering it\", whilst Gareth Dobson, giving the album nine out of ten, noted that \"rarely does a debut record offer such assuredness, consistency and creative quality.\" Dobson went on to say \"\"Please Introduce Yourself\" is the best indie record of the year bar none, for no other band has successfully mixed playful and serious, novel and attention grabbing and hip and super uncool as much as this has.\" David Peinser of \"Rolling Stone\" placed the album at number four on his list of the top ten best albums of 2004, saying: \"[The] Scottish five-piece makes a buoyant pop album that nods to a bunch of bands you never knew you missed.\"\n\nWilliam Swygart of Stylus drew attention to the \"frustratingly flimsy feel\" of the album, calling it \"that of a band that think they’re much better than they really are.\" However, Swygart went on to acknowledge the \"genuinely enjoyable moments\", noting that it was the band's first album. Andy Gill of \"The Independent\" called it \"an oddly hollow experience.\"\n\n\"Please Describe Yourself\" debuted and peaked on the UK Albums Chart at number 44 on the week of 24 July 2004. The album dropped to number 71 the following week before exiting the Top 100.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2310875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310875", "title": "Gall (Native American leader)", "text": "Gall (Native American leader)\n\nGall (c. 1840–December 5, 1894), Lakota Phizí (Native American), was a battle leader of the Hunkpapa Lakota in the long war against the United States. He was also one of the commanders in the Battle of Little Bighorn.\n\nBorn in present-day South Dakota around 1840, and orphaned, Gall was said to receive his name after eating the gall of an animal killed by a neighbour.\n\nAn accomplished warrior by his late teens, Gall became a war chief in his twenties. As a Lakota war leader in the long conflict against United States intrusion onto tribal lands, Gall served with Sitting Bull during several battles, including the famous Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.\n\nSince the early 1980s, archaeological researchers conducted battlefield excavations after a major grass fire. Historians have been studying accounts by participating Indians and tribal oral histories. Based on these elements, a contemporary reassessment of the Battle of the Little Bighorn has given Gall greater credit for several crucial tactical decisions that contributed to the Sioux and Cheyenne's overpowering defeat of the five companies of cavalry led by Custer of the 7th Cavalry. \n\nMajor Marcus Reno's initial attack on the southeast end of the Indian village killed Gall's two wives and several children. Gall described it: \"My heart was very bad that day.\" During the opening phase of the battle, the Lakota and Cheyenne repulsed Reno's three companies of cavalry from the south-eastern end of their large village. Gall was one of the few Indians to suspect that Custer's strategy was probably a two-pronged attack. He believed that determining the location of the other half of Custer's attacking force was critical to Indian defense.\n\nGall crossed the river and rode to the northeast, where he spied Custer's chief scout, Mitch Bouyer, returning to Custer from an overwatch of the Indian village. After locating the main element of Custer's five companies, Gall correctly determined that they probably intended to force a river crossing and an entrance into the northern end of the village. Riding back down from the bluffs, Gall told Sioux and Cheyenne forces returning from Reno's repulse of his suspicions. With Crazy Horse, he led forces north across the river to drive Company E and F due north up present-day Calhoun Couley to present-day Finley Ridge. There they forced three of Custer's companies to fight a largely defensive battle.\n\nWithin minutes, Gall and his forces took a position north east of Finley Ridge and poured a withering fire down on Companies C, I and L. When Crazy Horse charged through an opening between Lt Calhoun's Company L and Company I in a sudden surprise right envelopment attack, Company L probably began to pull back off the ridge to try to link up with Company I. Companies C and L's tried to redeploy from holding off Gall's men to the east and others to the south. This probably looked like a panicked retreat to Gall and his forces.\n\nSeeing that the two Cavalry companies no longer had the fire superiority that held the Indians at bay, Gall and his men attacked from the east as the other Indians attacked the cut-off elements of Company C from both the east and the south. They soon finished off Companies C and L, and forced survivors and some of Company I to flee towards Custer and his men north of the so-called \"Last Stand Hill.\" A few of the soldiers of Companies C, I and L also fled south toward the river. The places where they fell were later marked by white marble monuments, which still stand.\n\nSoon the Indians finished off Custer and his men in the remaining companies C, E, and K. The last approximately 28 survivors made a dash south for the river. They were trapped in the box canyon called \"Deep Ravine\". After killing them, the Indians had won the battle, having completely annihilated Custer's five companies.\n\nIn later years, Gall recounted his role in the battle. He had mistakenly thought the survivors of Custer's three southeastern companies fled northwest to Custer because they ran out of ammunition. The horse soldiers may also have fled after losing their will to fight, as many men simply ran, even abandoning loaded rifles. The Sioux and Cheyenne picked these up and fired the weapons to drive off the soldiers' horses, thus depriving them of a key tactical mobility advantage. The native warriors' attacking Greasy Grass Ridge from the southeast came mostly on foot. Gall kept up enfilading fire from the northeast.\n\nIn late 1876, many of the Hunkpapa bands crossed over the border into Canada, where they struggled to survive for the next several years. Gall came to disagree with Sitting Bull and brought his band back to the United States in 1880 and surrendered. On May 26, 1881, he and his followers were loaded onto steamers (along with Crow King, Black Moon, Low Dog and Fools Heart) and shipped downriver to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The first complete census of the Lakota at Standing Rock, taken in the fall of 1881 listed Gall with a band of 52 families, totaling 230 people.\n\nBecoming a farmer, Gall encouraged his people to assimilate to reservation life. He also converted to Christianity, took the additional name Abraham, and served as a judge on the reservation's Court of Indian Affairs. He became friendly with the Indian Agent, James McLaughlin. The 1885 reservation census listed Gall as responsible for 22 lodges and 114 people.\n\nEventually Gall disagreed with Sitting Bull, who had become involved with the Ghost Dance movement, and who was killed by a tribal policeman in a bungled confrontation in 1890.\n\nGall lived on the Standing Rock Agency until his death at his Oak Creek home on December 5, 1894. He is buried in Saint Elizabeth Episcopal Cemetery in Wakpala, South Dakota. In 1991, his remains were exhumed because a Utah state park museum purported to have his skull, but his remains were found intact.\n\n"}

In the ensuing action, known as the Battle of Cape Passaro, the Spanish fleet was devastated: 10 ships of the line were captured, four ships of the line sunk or burnt and four frigates were captured at this early and critical stage of the War of the Quadruple Alliance. He went on to be First Lord of the Admiralty during the reign of King George II.\n\nBorn the son of John Byng and Philadelphia Byng (née Johnson), Byng joined the Royal Navy as a King's Letter Boy in May 1678. He served initially in the fourth-rate HMS \"Swallow\" and then transferred to the fourth-rate HMS \"Reserve\" in November 1678 and to the fourth-rate HMS \"Mary Rose\" in June 1679. He sailed with the fifth-rate HMS \"Phoenix\" to Tangier in Summer 1680 and, after a short period of military service with the 2nd Tangier Regiment, he rejoined the Royal Navy as a lieutenant on 23 February 1684 and assigned to the fourth-rate HMS \"Oxford\" before returning to HMS \"Phoenix\" in which he sailed to the East Indies on a mission to put down a rebellion in Bombay. He transferred to the fourth-rate HMS \"Mordaunt\" in May 1688 and to the third-rate HMS \"Defiance\" in September 1688.\nIn October 1688 Byng, still a lieutenant, delivered a letter from various captains to Prince William of Orange, who had just landed at Torbay, assuring the Prince of the captains' support; the Prince gave Byng a response which ultimately led to the Royal Navy switching allegiance to the Prince and the Glorious Revolution of November 1688.

He transferred to the command of the second-rate HMS \"Duchess\" in September 1690 and to the third-rate HMS \"Royal Oak\" in January 1691 before becoming Flag Captain to Admiral Edward Russell in the first-rate HMS \"Britannia\" in December 1693.\n\nByng was given command of the third-rate HMS \"Nassau\" in June 1702 and saw action at the Battle of Vigo Bay, when the French fleet were defeated, in October 1702 during the War of the Spanish Succession.\n\nPromoted to rear admiral on 1 March 1703, Byng became third-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet under Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell with his flag in the third-rate HMS \"Ranelagh\" later that month. He led the bombardment squadron while serving under Admiral Sir George Rooke at the Capture of Gibraltar in August 1704 and then took part in the Battle of Málaga in August 1704. Knighted on 22 October 1704, and promoted to vice admiral on 3 January 1705, he was elected Member of Parliament for Plymouth later that year.\n\nByng became Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, with his flag in the first-rate HMS \"Royal Anne\", in late 1705 and then took part in the bombardment of Alicante in June 1706. After taking part in the British defeat at the Battle of Toulon in July 1707 and, while sailing aboard his flagship HMS \"Royal Anne\", Byng was present during the great naval disaster off the Isles of Scilly in October 1707 when Shovell and four of his ships were lost, claiming the lives of nearly 2,000 sailors.\n\nPromoted to full admiral on 26 January 1708, Byng became Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet in January 1709 and went on to join the Board of Admiralty led by the Earl of Orford in November 1709. Byng was advanced to Senior Naval Lord on the Admiralty Board in October 1710. He stood down from the Admiralty Board in January 1714 but was reappointed, as Senior Naval Lord again, on Orford's return to the Admiralty in October 1714.\nByng took part in the suppression of the Jacobite rising by cutting off the Old Pretender's supplies in 1715 and for this he was created a baronet on 15 November 1715. He was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 14 March 1718 and, with his flag in the second-rate HMS \"Barfleur\", he was sent out as Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet to thwart any attempt by the Spanish to gain or to consolidate their position in Sicily. He encountered the Spanish fleet at Naples and, after pursuing it down the Strait of Messina, sent ahead his fastest ships causing the Spanish fleet to split in two.

Following his return to England, Byng became both Treasurer of the Navy and Rear-Admiral of Great Britain on 21 October 1720. He was admitted to the Privy Council on 3 January 1721 and, having stepped down from the Admiralty Board in September 1721, was created Baron Byng of Southill in the county of Bedford, and 1st Viscount Torrington in Devon on 21 September 1721.

Together the couple had fifteen children (eleven sons and four daughters) of whom six lived to survive him:\n\nByng died on 17 January 1733 and was eventually buried in a vault within the newly constructed \"Byng Mausoleum\" attached to the north side of the Church of All Saints in the parish of Southill, Bedfordshire, in which parish was situated his residence of Southill Park. The mausoleum was constructed for his burial, with licence granted by the Bishop of Lincoln in 1733.

{"id": "2310881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310881", "title": "Spider-Ham", "text": "Spider-Ham\n\nSpider-Ham is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is an anthropomorphic funny animal parody version of Spider-Man, and was created by editor Larry Hama, Tom DeFalco and Mark Armstrong.\n\nHe first appeared in the one-shot humor comic book \"Marvel Tails Starring Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham\" (November 1983), which was then followed by an ongoing bi-monthly series, \"Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham\", under Marvel's Star Comics imprint, with both titles edited by Hama. The character existed on Earth-8311, which was a universe populated by anthropomorphic funny animal parody versions of the Marvel superheroes and supervillains. Spider-Ham made his feature film debut in \"\" (2018), voiced by John Mulaney.\n\nSpider-Ham was first featured as star of the 1983 humorous one-shot \"Marvel Tails\", with a backup cast of other anthropomorphic funny animal parody versions of popular Marvel superheroes, such as Captain AmeriCat (a cat version of Captain America), Hulk-Bunny (a rabbit version of Hulk) and Goose Rider (a goose version of Ghost Rider).\n\nTwo years later, a solo series, titled \"Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham\" debuted under Marvel's Star Comics imprint. The series, published bi-monthly, lasted seventeen issues before its cancellation in 1987. With the cancellation of \"Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham\", the character became a backup feature in \"Marvel Tales\", a monthly reprint series showcasing Spider-Man's past adventures. Beginning with issue #201 (cover dated July 1987), these new Spider-Ham stories appeared in issues #201–212, 214–219, 223–230, 233, 236, 237, 239, 240, and 247 before ceasing altogether.\n\nIn issue #3 of \"What The--?!\" (cover dated October 1988), Porker meets with Raven the Hunter (a parody of Spider-Man's nemesis Kraven the Hunter) in a story that satirized the popular \"Kraven's Last Hunt\" storyline which had been featured a year earlier in Marvel's Spider-Man titles. Spider-Ham also makes appearances in issues #18, 20, 22, and 24 of \"What The--?!\" The 26th issue of \"What The--?!\" (cover dated fall 1993) features \"Spider-Ham 15.88\", a humorous take-off on Peter Parker's future counterpart, Miguel O'Hara a.k.a. \"Spider-Man 2099\". The \"15.88\" is not seen as a year, but rather a humorous take on the price of a ham (the cover states that it was marked down from the original price of $20.99).\n\nSpider-Ham has also appeared on the cover of \"Wha...Huh?\" #1, and was referred to as a fictional character in the Earth-616 Marvel Universe, in \"Generation X\" #52.\n\n\"Spider-Man Family\" #1 (2005 one-shot) features a sixteen-page \"Spider-Girl\" story, in which May Parker (Peter Parker's daughter) watches a DVD showing a small portion of a fictional Spider-Ham animated series, discovering that it was created by one of Spider-Man's enemies, Jack O'Lantern. Here, Spider-Ham appears to mostly be a parody of Batman. Also in the issue, there is a partial reprint of \"Marvel Tails\" #1.\n\nSpider-Ham was selected by fans and retailers to be the focus of the final variant cover by Mike Wieringo to the \"\" crossover, \"Amazing Spider-Man\" #528.\n\nIn January 2007, J. Michael Straczynski authored the \"Ultimate Civil War Spider-Ham\" one-shot, featuring Spider-Ham's attempt to find his missing \"thought balloons\" against a Civil War parody. The story does not fit in with previously established Spider-Ham continuity.\n\nTom Defalco returned to Spider-Ham's world in 2009, in the pages of \"Amazing Spider-Man Family\" #4–5. He introduces Swiney-Girl, the daughter of Spider-Ham and counterpart of Defalco's other creation Spider-Girl. Once again, the story strays away from the established, albeit loose, continuity of the original Spider-Ham stories by altering the character's origin and supporting characters, most notably in establishing Peter Porker as a natural-born pig bitten by a radioactive spider (directly mirroring Spider-Man's origin) and altering his love interest (a counterpart of Mary Jane Watson) from a water buffalo to a crane.\n\nHe fights alongside the \"X-Babies\" in issue #4 (March 2010) of their four-issue miniseries from 2009–2010.\n\nTo mark the anniversary of \"Peter Porker, The Spectacular Spider-Ham\" #1, Marvel released the \"Spider-Ham 25th Anniversary Special\" in July 2010, with Tom Defalco writing both Spider-Ham and Swiney-Girl stories. These stories feature most of Spider-Ham's original cast and origin, but incorporates the Mary Crane Watsow character from \"Amazing Spider-Man Family\" rather than her original counterpart.\n\nPeter Porker was born a spider (simply named Peter). He resided in the basement lab of May Porker, a slightly goofy animal scientist who had created \"the world's first atomic powered hairdryer\", hoping that \"the introduction of nuclear fusion into America's beauty salons\" would \"revolutionize the hair care industry\". After dousing her head with water and activating the dryer, May Porker accidentally irradiated herself, and in a fit of delusion, bit Peter, who then found himself transformed into an anthropomorphic swine much like May Porker herself. Running from the Porker homestead disoriented, Peter soon came to realize that he still retained a spider's abilities:\n\n\"\"This is astounding! Am I a spider with the limitations of a pig? Or a pig with the proportionate strength and agility of a spider? I've become something greater than either spider or pig... I've become a Spider-Ham!\"\" – \"Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham\" #15 (May 1987)\n\nAfter this startling series of events, Peter (who adopted the surname \"Porker\", that of his benefactor May Porker, who after the accident mentally attuned to a state in which she believed she was Peter's loving aunt) dedicated himself and his new-found abilities to fighting injustice and the occasional animal parody of established Marvel Comics villains. May Porker's scientific genius was transferred to Peter, giving him the know-how to devise his webspinner gauntlets to replace his lost natural ability.\n\nPorker, in his spider-themed alter-ego's first adventure, teamed up with Captain Americat, as they attempted to foil the nefarious plot of The Marauder, in a series of events that led to the creation of the Hulk-Bunny (\"Marvel Tails\" #1, \"If He Should Punch Me\").\n\nSeveral months later, Spider-Ham encountered his main nemesis and one of his only recurring enemies in the form of Ducktor Doom, a duck parody of Doctor Doom (\"Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham\" #1, \"The Mysterious Island of Ducktor Doom\"). Spider-Ham would meet again with Doom when Porker would foil the would-be world conqueror's plot to create an army of living super vegetables (\"Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham\" #6, \"Salad Daze\").\n\nOther notable menaces Porker would face along the way include the Bull-Frog (a parody of the Marvel villain Man-Bull), the Buzzard (an opossum take on the Spider-Man adversary the Vulture), Hogzilla (a swine counterpart to the more popular Godzilla), and the King-Pig (seemingly the swine equivalent of Marvel's mob-boss the Kingpin).\n\nThree characters, not parallels to anybody in the Spider-Man series, also begin in #1: J. Jeremiah Jackal, Jr. (J. Jonah Jackal's nephew), Bunson Bunny and Upton Adam Stray (a cat with shades), all junior trainees at the Daily Beagle. They acquire super-powers in #15, encouraging Spider-Ham in his already made decision to abandon his super-hero career, but they fumble their first mission, forcing Peter Porker to resume his alter-ego as Spider-Ham. Further misadventures of the Beagle Brigadeers were presented within the back-up stories in \"Marvel Tales\".\n\nThe series also included back-up stories featuring such characters as Deerdevil (Daredevil), Goose Rider (Ghost Rider) and the Fantastic Fur (the Fantastic Four).\n\nWhen Spider-Ham accidentally travels to the \"Marvel Zombies\" universe, he is suddenly zombified by a group of zombies, namely Captain America, Hulk, and Wolverine. It appears that he is directly shot in the head by an energy bullet by Earth 616's Ultron, effectively killing him but, in a zombie state, Spider-Ham turned into Ham-ibal Lecter.\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Verse\" storyline which featured Spider-Men from various alternate realities, Spider-Ham became a member of the Spider-Army fighting against the Inheritors. He played a crucial role in the final confrontation when he switches places with Benjy Parker (the baby brother of Spider-Girl of Earth-982) – one of the three sacrifices needed for the Inheritors to destroy the Spider-Totems – allowing Ben Parker to get Benjy to safety.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Wars\" event when all universes were destroyed and their remains formed a single planet called Battleworld, Spider-Ham found himself the only pig in the domain of the Battleworld called Arachnia and ended up as the captive of its Mayor, Norman Osborn. He was rescued by Spider-Gwen, and the two eventually discovered and teamed up with other spider-powered people (Spider-Man Noir, , Spider-UK and Anya Corazon), neither of whom remembered their previous encounter during the original \"Spider-Verse\".\n\nFollowing the conclusion of \"Secret Wars\", the team of six Spiders that formed during the event feature in a new ongoing series called \"Web Warriors\", a name that was coined by the Peter Parker of the \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" TV series during the original \"Spider-Verse\".\n\nEarth-8311 features anthropomorphic funny animal parody versions of a variety of other Marvel characters including some superheroes and supervillains.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August 2009, \"TIME\" listed Spider-Ham as one of the \"Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters\".\n\n"}

He was captured by French forces and was a prisoner of war. While being held by the French he was taken to France and there he became aware of deism. He soon became a deist.\n\nUpon returning to Spain, he used his position as a school master to teach others about deism. There he was soon accused by the Spanish Inquisition of being a deist and of teaching his students about deism. He was later arrested for heresy and held in jail for close to two years.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Faith from the Diocese of Valencia, Miguel Toranzo, an inquisitor, sent to the nuncio Archbishop of Valencia a report that said Ripoll did not believe in Jesus Christ, in the mystery of the Trinity, in the Incarnation of God the Son, in the Holy Eucharist, in the Virgin Mary, in the Holy Gospels, in the infallibility of the Holy Catholic Church, or in the Apostolic Roman Congregation. Ripoll did not fulfill his Easter duty, he discouraged children from reciting the 'Ave Maria Purisima' and suggested they need not bother making the sign of the cross. It was alleged that, according to Ripoll, it was not necessary to hear Mass in order to save one's soul from damnation, and he failed to instruct them to give due reverence to the Sacraments of the Catholic Church, even the \"Viaticum\" administered for the comfort of the sick and to pardon the dying that they might be resurrected into heaven.\n\nFor these grievous sins and his denial of the Catechism of the Catholic Church the clergymen of the Spanish Inquisition demanded Ripoll be burned at the stake for his religious offenses in order that he might recant in his agony and thus go to heaven. However, the civil authority chose to hang him instead.\n\nAllegedly, the Church authorities, upset that Ripoll had not been burned at the stake, placed his body into a barrel, painted flames on the barrel and buried it in unconsecrated ground. Other reports state that the Church authorities placed his body into a barrel and burned the barrel, throwing the ashes into a river. Ripoll is recorded as being the last known person to have been executed under sentence from a Church authority for having committed the act of heresy.\n\nRipoll's famous last words were, \"I die reconciled to God and to man.\"\n"}

It was held by many petty authorities, including many lords of the manor, who sat in justice over the serfs, unfree tenants, and freeholders on their land. \nMiddle justice would involve full civil and criminal jurisdiction, except for capital crimes, and notably excluding the right to pass the death penalty, torture and severe corporal punishment, which was reserved to authorities holding high justice, or the \"ius gladii\" (\"right of the sword\").\n\nAlthough the terms \"high\" and \"low\" suggest a strict subordination, this was not quite the case; a case could often be brought in any of several courts, with the principle of \"prevention\" (in the etymological sense of Latin \"praevenire\", \"to come before\") granting jurisdiction to the court in which the case was first filed or otherwise brought.\n\nAs a rule, each court administered justice in general (criminal cases were generally not separate from civil actions and other types of justice, while certain matters were separated such as canon law), as long as the matter was not reserved for a higher court or by virtue of some \"privilegium fori\" (e.g., of clerics to be judged in canon courts by other clergy, sometimes under ecclesiastical law, the origin of the English common-law concept—benefit of clergy). In addition to civil and criminal trials, the notion of justice also included \"voluntary justice\", which is really the official recording of deeds (unilateral or bilateral) such as marital agreements, wills, grants, etc.\n\nA right of appeal was not automatically available, only when explicitly established, and if so not always to a court of the superior political level or a higher degree of the trio. In fact, feudal justice was a labyrinth of specific customs and rules in nearly endless variation, not governed by any clear legal logic, and subject to significant historical evolution in time, though the largely customary law tended by nature to be quite conservative. In judicial matters—as in all spheres of life—feudal society did not see uniformity as either possible or necessarily desirable, each town and region having its own customs and ways of doing things, and resented attempts to interfere with them.\n\nWhile the right of justice is held by many \"unique\" courts, relatively strong states make it a pillar of their absolutist (re)emergence to establish numerous courts to administer justice in their name in different territorial circumscriptions, such as the royal (high) sheriffs in England, or to impose an appeal (at least unifying the law as such) to a royal court, as to the various French provincial \"parlements\".\n\nHigh justice, also known as \"ius gladii\" (\"right of the sword\") or in German as \"Blutgerichtsbarkeit\", \"Blutgericht\" (lit. \"blood justice\", \"blood-court\"; sometimes also \"Halsgericht\", lit. \"neck-justice\", or \"peinliches Gericht\") is the highest penal authority, including capital punishment, as held by a sovereign—the sword of justice and hand of justice are regalia that symbolize it. In the early Holy Roman Empire, high justice was reserved to the king. From the 13th century, it was transferred to the king's vassals along with their fiefs.\nThe first codification of capital punishment was the \"Halsgerichtsordnung\" passed by Maximilian I in 1499, followed in 1507 by the \"Constitutio Criminalis Bambergensis\". Both codes formed the basis of the \"Constitutio Criminalis Carolina\" (CCC), passed in 1532 under Charles V. In the Habsburg Monarchy, all regional codes were superseded by the \"Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana\" in 1768.\n\nThe \"Blutbanner\" (\"blood banner\") or \"Blutfahne\" (\"blood flag\") was a solid red flag. It was presented to feudal lords as a symbol of their power of high jurisdiction (\"Blutgerichtsbarkeit\") together with the heraldic banner of the fief. Some feudal houses adopted a red field symbolic of the blood banner into their coat of arms, the so-called \"Regalienfeld\".\nThe Talschaft (forest canton) of Schwyz used the blood banner as a war flag from ca. 1240, and was later incorporated into the flag of Schwyz and the flag of Switzerland.\n\nOften it is proudly displayed, in the form of relevant status symbols. Thus permanent gallows are often erected in prominent public places; the very word for them in French, \"potence\", is derived from the Latin \"potentia\" meaning \"power\".\n\nHigh justice is held by all states and the highest vassals in the European type of feudal society, but may also be acquired by other authorities as part of a high degree of legal autonomy, such as certain cities; which in time often obtained other high privileges originally reserved for high nobility and sometimes high clergy. Other such privileges could include a seat in a diet or a similar feudal representative assembly, before the third estate as such even aspired to such \"parliamentary\" representation, or the right to mint coins. These privileges indicating its so-called \"liberty\" was an \"equal\" enclave in the territorial jurisdiction of the neighboring feudal (temporal or ecclesiastical) Lord, sometimes even extending rather like a \"polis\" in Antiquity.\n\nNot every Vogt held high justice. Up to the 18th century, for example, the blood court of much of what is now the canton of Zürich lay with Kyburg, even in the territory ruled by the counts of Greifensee. The self-administration of the blood court was an important factor of Imperial immediacy.\n\n\n"}

He was at first refused admittance on account of an impediment in his speech; however, after imploring delivery from this impediment before a picture of Mary at Córdoba, Spain, his application was granted. For a time he was the Master of Novices at Granada. The remainder of his life was devoted to the composition of his works. He died of pneumonia. \n\nHis contemporaries bear testimony to the energy and perseverance with which he laboured towards self-perfection from his novitiate until his death. His penitential zeal rivalled that of the early anchorites, and, according to his spiritual director, he carried his baptismal innocence to the grave. Luis de la Puente, then rector of the college of Granada and later declared \"venerable\", attests the holiness of Sanchez in his letter to Francisco Suárez, a translation of which may be found in the \"Bibliothèque de Bourgogne\" at Brussels.\n\nThe chief work of Sanchez (and the only one that he himself edited) is the \"Disputationes de sancti matrimonii sacramento\". The first edition is said to have appeared at Genoa in 1602; but this can have been only the first folio volume, for which permission to print was secured in 1599, as the two succeeding volumes contain both in their preface and the author's dedication the date 1603. The first complete edition was, according to Sommervogel, that of Madrid, 1605; later followed a series of editions printed at different places both before and after the author's death. The last edition seems to have been issued at Venice in 1754.\n\nSome editions of the third volume have been placed on the Index of Prohibited Books, the grounds being not the doctrine of the author, but the perversion of the work and the suppression of what the author taught. Even in the earlier editions of the Index as revised by Leo XIII, until his Constitution \"\"Officorum ac munerum\"\", we may still read:\n\n\"\"Sanchez, Thom. Disputationum de Sacramento Matrimonii tom. III. Ed. Venetiae, sive alarium , a quibus 1.8 disp. 7 detractus est integer num. 4. Decr. 4 Febr. 1627\".\"\n\nThis number is omitted from the edition of Venice, 1614; it treats of the power of the pope to grant a valid legitimation of the offspring of marriages invalid only through canon law through the so-called \"sanatio in radice\". The author's mode of expression shows a not always pleasing verbosity. \n\nSoon after the death of Sanchez a second work appeared. \"Opus morale in præcepta Decalogi\"; the first folio volume was prepared by the author himself, but the second volume, as well as the whole of his third work, \"Consilia moralia\", had to be compiled from manuscript notes. These works also went through a series of different editions, and likewise drew upon themselves the accusation of laxity, especially with reference to the question of what is called \"mental reservation\" (\"restrictio mentalis\"). Blaise Pascal in particular criticized him in his \"Provincial Letters\".\n\nOf the 26 thesis condemned by Pope Innocent XI, several were in Sanchez's works (see op. mor. in præc. Decalogi, III, vi, n. 15). One of them stated:\n\nAccording to Franz Xavier Wernz (\"Jus decretalium\", IV, n. 20), Sanchez's work \"De matrimonio\" was reckoned by the Roman Curia among the classical works on marriage.\n\n"}

The preserve contains about 5 miles (8 km) of hiking trails, of which 2.1 miles (3.4 km) are open to equestrians, and none are open to bicycles.\n\nThe area was once a part of a 13,300 acre (53.8 km²) rancho. The preserve's acreage was purchased by state senator Louis Oneal in the early 1900s, who raised horses there. It was sold to a developer in the 1950s. Power and water lines were run to the property in the 1960s, but development was abandoned when the city of Palo Alto discovered the high cost of providing city services to the area. The preserve was acquired by the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District in 1976.\n\nWhile the preserve is relatively small compared to other preserves and parks in the area, it has one notable feature: about one mile (1.5 km) of the San Andreas Fault runs underneath it. Several series of markers throughout the preserve indicate where the ground has broken during various earthquakes.\n\nAdditionally, a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) trail follows the main break caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

Chef-lieu of the canton of Granville and seat of the , it is a seaside resort and health resort of Mont Saint-Michel Bay at the end of the , a former cod fishing port and the first shellfish port of France. It is sometimes nicknamed \"Monaco of the north\" by virtue of its location on a rocky promontory.\n\nThe town was founded by a vassal of William the Conqueror, on land occupied by the Vikings, in the 11th century. The old privateer city and fortification, for the defence of Mont Saint-Michel, became a seaside resort in the 19th century which was frequented by many artists, and equipped with a golf course and a horse racing course.\n\nHome of the of industrialists, an important commune which absorbed the village of Saint-Nicolas-près-Granville in 1962, port and airport of South Manche, it has also been a Douzelage city since 1991, twinned with 20 European cities. Administratively, the islands of Chausey, the French Channel Islands, which include a small harbour, are part of the commune of Granville.\n\nThe town is populated by 13,021 inhabitants, who are called \"Granvillais\".\n\nGranville is located at the edge of the English Channel at the extremity of the of the Cotentin, it closes the north of the Bay of Mont Saint-Michel and the south of the . The upper town is located on a peninsula surrounded by schist cliffs, known as Pointe du Roc or Cap Lihou. The rest of the town extends eastward inland, bounded on the north by the , a short coastal river, and on the south by alternating cliffs and beaches up to the Saigue stream.\n\nThe commune has four sand beaches, one to the north between the peninsula and the river, three to the south on the bay. It occupies , of mostly urbanised territory but this urbanisation is now limited by the Natura 2000 European directive and the . The town is part of the of . The National Institute of Geographic Information and Forestry gives the co-ordinates as . It is at the centre of the .\n\nClosing in the north of the Bay of Mont Saint-Michel and its foreshore of a very gentle gradient, it enjoys the highest tides in Europe, up to of tidal range. This situation also sometimes leads to significant changes of the coastal features of the nearby beaches.\n\nOff the coast, the archipelago of the Chausey Islands is administered by the commune of Granville. It is one of the only island quarters of France. It consists of 52 islands of granite at high tide and more than 365 at low tide covering almost .\n\nGranville is located southwest of its insular district of Chausey, to the west of Notre-Dame in Paris, , southwest of Saint-Lô, northwest of Avranches, southwest of Coutances, to the south of Cherbourg-Octeville, north of Mont Saint-Michel, northeast of Cancale and to the southwest of Caen.\n\nA legacy of generations of sailors from the commune, it is also located from Granville in the State of New York, from Granville, West Virginia and from Granville, Ohio, among others.\n\nGranville has natural limits materialised by the river to the north and the Saigue stream in the south. For a few years, an artificial river pierced between the mainland and the peninsula. It was filled and is now replaced by \"Place du Maréchal-Foch\".\n\nThe commune is largely at sea level. It rises only towards the interior, a little more on the peninsula from the Pointe du Roc to reach .\n\nGranville, located on the Pointe du Roc is washed to the north, south and to the west by the English Channel. To the northeast lies the commune of Donville-les-Bains, the village of Yquelon is to the east and to the southeast are the small seaside resort of Saint-Pair-sur-Mer and the village of Saint-Planchers. The island quarter of Chausey is located off to the northwest, and Mont Saint-Michel is to the south.\n\nGranville is located on the English Channel coast, it is therefore subject to an oceanic climate. However its positioning on the Bay of the Mont Saint-Michel, at the bottom of the gulf formed by Normandy and Brittany, allows it to be relatively protected from storms and wind (even though it may be exposed to the ) and enjoy mild temperatures. Annual average temperature stood at with a maximum of and a minimum of . The maximum nominal temperatures of in July–August and in January–February show the mildness of the climate and the lack of thermal amplitude. The insolation values given here are those of the station of Caen, due to the lack of local data. Contrary to a common misconception, of total precipitation shows that Normandy is not a wetter region than others. The record of rainfall per 24-hour period was established during a storm on 11 July 1977 with of water.\n\nIn the 1987 storm, wind culminated at in gusts, which is the current absolute record for the city.\n\nSeveral highways serve the commune including the downgraded roads (now the RD 971 from Carentan), (now the RD 924 towards Villedieu-les-Poêles) and (now the RD 973 from Avranches). Granville is located from the A84 (E401). It is also crossed from north to south by the old , today the RD 911, the road to the coast at Avranches.\n\nThe departing from Paris-Montparnasse railway station has its terminus at Granville station, it is used by and TER Basse-Normandie. The northern section of the LGV des estuaires project should increase opportunities for connections to and from Granville.\n\nSeveral bus routes connect Granville with a network set up by the General Council of Manche, with routes 2, 3, 7, 116, 122, 202, 300, 302 and 305, and the Néva network since December 2014, created and operated in-house by the town of Granville.\n\nThe allows landings of private aircraft and the Caen – Carpiquet Airport ensures the interregional links.\n\nBy boat, the port of Granville serves the Chausey Islands and the Channel Islands (44,100 passengers) and hosts freight activities (197,000 tonnes).\n\nAn urban transport network is planned for 2014 and should cross the whole .\n\nThe commune is divided into several quarters, the Haute Ville, the historic heart behind the ramparts, Couraye, La Tranchée which occupies the former site of an arm of the sea dug by man, Le Calvaire, Le Centre, current town centre and Saint-Nicolas, which corresponds to the former commune of Saint-Nicolas-près-Granville, joined in 1962. The quarter of the Agora has been classified priority in the title under the policy of the commune.\n\nThe name of the city is mentioned in the forms of \"Grandivilla\" in 1054, \"Grande Villa\" in 1056, \"Grandvilla\" in 1172 and \"Granville\" in 1175.\n\nAll modern toponymists agree on the origin of the \"Gran-\" element: Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing have classed Granville with the toponyms of the Grandvelle/Grandville type, whose first term is explained just by the Old French \"grant\" (\"grand\"). François de Beaurepaire followed suit, as well as Ernest Nègre and .\n\nAccording to Edouard Le Héricher (\"Avranchin monumental and historic\") the origin of the toponym is explained by a character named \"Grant\" who received the fief of Rollo of Normandy during the conquest of Neustria.\n\nIf experts agree all that it is a medieval formation of \"-ville\", the exact meaning to give this suffix varies between \"village, hamlet\" (Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing, François de Beaurepaire, Ernest Nègre) and \"domain\" (René Lepelley) which should probably be in the sense of \"rural area\", initially it had the value of the Gallo-Roman .\n\nSome historians and geographers of the past have attempted to connect Granville to the \"Grannonum\"/\"Grannona\", toponym attested in the Notitia Dignitatum on the Saxon Shore from the late Roman Empire: \"tribunus cohortis primae Armoricanae, Grannona novae in litore Saxonico\". This explains why some 18th-century maps describing the former Roman Gaul revealed the name of \"Grannonum\" at the location of Granville (see map opposite). This hypothesis is now abandoned by contemporary practitioners.\n\nDuring the Revolution, the town temporarily took the name of \"Granville-la-Victoire\" (after the siege of the Vendéens she had victoriously endured in 1793), the name was then formalised without this complementary addition.\n\nAccording to the standard Norman spelling developed in the second half of the 20th century, the name of the town is written as \"Graunville\" ().\n\nCap Lihou is named from the Old Norse word \"holm\" meaning \"island, islet\" and which has in some cases evolved as \"-hou\", as the endpoint.\n\nAccording to a legend concerning the Mont Saint-Michel Bay, Granville and the insular quarter of Chausey were covered in the , sunken in 709. Granville, in the heart of the land, would then become like Dinard and Saint-Malo a coastal town known as Roque de Lihou.\n\nIn 1066, William the Conqueror in his conquest of England, sought the help of the \"Grant\" family. As a token of recognition, he awarded the lands of Roque de Lihou. The Grants are therefore the first Lords of the town after the Vikings. In 1143, the parish of Notre-Dame was created. It is probable that monks from Mont-Saint-Michel went to the Priory on Lihou during the first half of the 12th century. In 1252, in the absence of a male descendant, Jeanne de Granville married Raoul d'Argouges, Lord of Gratot. In 1424, the criminal case of Pierre Le Maçon took place in Granville, which was then judged by the chancery of Henry VI of England in February 1425, in Paris. In 1439, the construction of the began.\n\nOn 26 October 1439, Sir Thomas de Scales, Seneschal of Normandy, and English officer of the Hundred Years' War, bought the Roque of Jean d'Argouges. On order of King Henry VI of England, in order to isolate Mont Saint-Michel, the last French bridgehead into Norman territory, he had the walls of Granville built. In 1440, the construction of the fortress began. To further protect this city, Lord Thomas de Scales had a ditch dug between the peninsula and the mainland, so that the sea and the waters of the Boscq made the peninsula an island.\n\nHowever, on 8 November 1442, by ruse, took over the castle since which has remained permanently in the hands of the French. Charles VII decided to make Granville a fortified town and signed a charter in 1445 granting arms and exempting the residents of tax. From 1450, ships were fishing at Newfoundland. In 1470, Louis XI visited the town to ensure its loyalty in the conflict opposing the Bretons and Burgundians. In 1492, the Jews of Spain, expelled by the Alhambra Decree, arrived in France. A community settled in Granville, their right to trade and to lend money allowed the town to arm a large fleet.\n\nIn 1562, the restoration of the ramparts began and a garrison moved into the barracks. Then in 1593 the keys to the city were presented to Henry IV, marking the importance of the town to the Kingdom. Under Louis XIII, the fortifications were adapted for artillery. From the reign of Louis XIV, Granville ships also had the right to capture. Therefore, between seventy and eighty ships were armed and Granville gave fifteen admirals to France, of which the best known is Georges René Le Peley de Pléville. In 1688, Louvois razed part of the defences of the town. Louis XIV appointed the first mayor of Granville in 1692: Luc Leboucher de Gastagny. However, in 1695, during the Nine Years' War, the English bombarded the city, destroying 27 houses. Vauban then studied possible improvements to the stronghold without having the time to carry them out.\n\nFollowing the attack, the ramparts were raised and increased in 1720. Then, from 1749, development work and expansion of the port was undertaken, with, in 1750, the laying of the breakwater, ever-present today. This work was completed in 1757, in the meantime, a new barracks was built. In 1763, a fire swept through the faubourgs. In 1777, a new barracks was added, the \"Gênes\" barracks still present today. On 20 July 1786, a new fire broke out, this time in the Tranchée quarter at the gates of the citadel.\n\nOn 14 November 1793, or 24 brumaire year II, was the Siege of Granville by the Vendéens during the Virée de Galerne. A force of some 25,000 Vendéen troops (followed by thousands of civilians of all ages), commanded by Henri de la Rochejaquelein, headed for the port of Granville where they expected to be greeted by a British fleet and an army of exiled French nobles. Arriving at Granville, they found the walled city surrounded by Republican forces, with no British ships in sight. Their attempts to take the city were unsuccessful. During the retreat the extended columns fell prey to Republican forces. Repulsed by the population, having lost two thousand men, they had to abandon the assault but left by burning the \"Rue des Juifs\". On 14 September 1803, the English again bombarded the town after imposing a blockade of the coast.\n\nFrom 1815, after years of military conflict, in full Restoration, Granville seemed to take a new direction. The chamber of commerce and industry was created; in 1816, the shores of the Boscq baptised \"Cours Jonville\"; in 1823, the breakwater was joined to the land, and in 1827, the first stone of the Roc Lighthouse was laid.\n\nGranville once formed part of the diocese of Coutances, the Parliament of Rouen and the intendance of Caen. Before the French Revolution, the town had two parishes: The Church of Notre-Dame du Cap Lihou and Saint-Nicolas. This parish was an appendix of Notre-Dame until Saint-Nicolas was set up in 1829 whose territory is regarded as a commune independent of Granville.\n\nThe port obtained its current appearance after 1856 and the inauguration of the wet dock and the lock. In 1860, the first wooden casino, built by former Mayor Méquin, was inaugurated. In 1865, it was followed by the hospice of St. Peter. In 1866, Victor Chesnais composed a hymn for his town, \"\"La Granvillaise\"\", adapted in 1868 at the theatre.\n\nIn 1867, the town acquired its first oared lifeboat, the \"Saint-Thomas-et-Saint-Joseph-de-Saint-Faron\". In 1869, the newspaper \"Le Granvillais\" was created, and in 1870, the and railway station were opened on 3 July. The town really became a seaside resort welcoming Parisians and guests such as Stendhal, Jules Michelet and Victor Hugo, and the parents of Maurice Denis who was born \"accidentally\" in Granville.\n\nFrom 1875, major construction resumed, with the construction of a reservoir of , Polotsk and Solferino barracks, and of the auction market hall. The town continued to equip itself with the opening in 1884 of the municipal library, in 1886 the school group of St. Paul, in 1887 the dry dock and in 1897 a corps of firefighters. To entertain holidaymakers, the Granvillaises Regatta Society was founded in 1889, the horse racing course and the \"Société des Courses\" of Granville in 1890, and the golf course in 1912. The Montparnasse derailment was on 22 October 1895, when the Granville–Paris express train overran the buffers at Paris Montparnasse station. Finally, in 1898, the St. Paul Church was inaugurated.\n\nThe 20th century began with the burning of the \"Château de la Crête\" in 1900. In 1905, fashion designer Christian Dior was born in Granville; his childhood home is now a museum. In 1908, the town was endowed with a visitor centre. It also became a centre of communication with the opening in 1908 of the railway line and tramway of Granville to Sourdeval, passing through Avranches, and one towards Condé-sur-Vire in 1910. In 1911, the new casino was opened, with the maternity hospital and the savings bank by minister Jules Pams. In 1912, electricity was installed in the commune and the \"Normandy-Hôtel\" was inaugurated. 1914 was a dark year for Granville with the loss of four sailors in the lifeboat accident of the \"Admiral-Amédée-Roze\" and departure for the war of the soldiers of the and .\n\nAfter the war, the regatta resumed in 1919, the carnival in 1920 and a son of the area, , became Minister of Commerce in the seventh government of Aristide Briand and came to visit the town in 1921. In 1925, a new railway station was inaugurated, Granville became a health resort and the \"Hôtel des Bains\" opened in 1926. In 1931, the last fishing vessel returned from Newfoundland.\n\nA garrison and coastal town closing the Bay of Mont Saint-Michel, Granville has always been coveted during armed conflicts in the area. During the Second World War, on 17 June 1940, the Germans entered Granville. On 21 September 1941, an article appeared in \"Le Granvillais\" signed by the name of \"Camille\", where the author was alerting readers to the dangers and lack of basis for the next laws on the status of Jews of the Vichy regime. Despite this mark of resistance, eight Granville Jews were deported to Auschwitz: Léon Bobulesco and his two sons Armand and Rodolphe, Simon Goldenberg, his wife Minka and their children Henri and Ruben, as well as Smil Weesler. Three Communists suffered the same fate: Léon Lamort, René Loncle and Charles Passot.\n\nThe whole of the population underwent the constraints of the Occupation. From the beginning, the Germans built fortifications on the Pointe du Roc and forbade access to the port. On 20 May 1942, a new municipal council was installed by the prefect. on 1 April 1943, all of the Haute-Ville had to be evacuated, barriers and anti-tank roadblocks prevented access. The Normandy Hotel was transformed into a kommandantur and a branch of the Gestapo.\n\nA signature name of this period was Maurice Marland. Born on 12 February 1888 in Falaise, and a teacher of English, French and civics, he led a resistance network. Notable in the town, in 1939, he organised the reception of Belgian refugees and the evacuation of British soldiers. Later, with Jules Leprince, they put escape routes to Jersey in place. Throughout the occupation, his relations enabled him to mount a clandestine intelligence network on port and rail facilities and enemy operations in the Channel Islands. Arrested and then released in 1941 and 1943, he nonetheless continued until 22 July 1944, when he was arrested and shot in the forest of Lucerne at the request of collaborators. On 23 July 1994, his son Serge Marland filed a complaint for crimes against humanity, the investigation concluded that he was assassinated by German soldiers. Today, the secondary school of the commune bears his name.\n\nOn 6 June 1944, the \"Green Plan\" of sabotage of railway lines was implemented to cut the . Liberated without fighting on 31 July 1944, it saw the troops of General Patton pass for two days, who went down to the town centre by the Coutances road and up the \"Rue Couraye\" to get out by the Avranches road: The vibration caused by the passage of armoured cars for two days brought down the façade nameplates of several houses.\n\nGranville was reoccupied for a few hours, during the Granville Raid of 9 March 1945, by German soldiers who had landed from Jersey. On 9 March 1945, while France was liberated and Allied troops, away, had begun to cross the Rhine, German troops based in still-occupied Jersey launched a daring commando raid against Granville. Although spotted by the radar of Coutainville, the Germans aboard light boats managed to land at night in the port of Granville. They dynamited port facilities and sank four freighters. Fifteen U.S., eight British and six French soldiers were killed, seventy German prisoners were released and five Americans and four British were captured before the German commando unit took flight.\n\nDuring the Algerian War, the barracks housed the 3rd Demi-brigade, and then the 21st Battalion of chasseurs on foot, from 1956 to 1961. It was a training centre for thousands of contingent recruits before leaving for Kabylie or the region of Tiaret. The commune hosted the finish of stage 1 and the start of stage 2 of the 1957 Tour de France.\n\nIn 1962, the town of Granville absorbed the commune of \"Saint-Nicolas-près-Granville\"; the latter, during the revolutionary period of the National Convention (1792–95), had borne the name \"Champ-Libre\" [Free Field]. On 4 June 1965, Granville welcomed Prime Minister Georges Pompidou.\n\nIn 1970, the Regional Nautical Centre moved to Granville and in 1975, the port was completed with a marina. In 1972, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Granville, founded in 1815, took the name CCI Granville-Saint-Lô, and which then became the in 2000. In 1973, opened a factory for the production of biscottes, in business ever since.\n\nIn the 1980s, donations by Richard Anacréon allowed the opening of the Museum of modern art, many buildings in the town were classified or registered as historical monuments. In 1982, the town was endowed of a new hospital. In 1984, the military regiments left the barracks, allowing redevelopment of the Pointe du Roc.\n\nIn 1991, the opened and the Charter of the Douzelage was signed.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the business incubator emerged. In 2003, the A84 autoroute joined Granville with other agglomerations.\n\nIn 2012, the commune had 13,021 inhabitants. Since 2004, the with more than 10,000 inhabitants takes place through annual surveys.\n\nOf 6,649 people at the beginning of the census of the people in 1793, the commune reached a demographic peak in 1861 with 17,180 inhabitants, prior to be severely affected by the War of 1870 by losing nearly 1,000 of its children. Then began a slow decline accentuated by the World War I, no longer accommodating more than 10,132 inhabitants in 1946. The second half of the 20th century - with the absorption of Saint-Nicolas-près-Granville in 1962, the rural exodus and the construction of many estates on the outskirts - allowed the commune to win residents again to achieve 13,022 inhabitants in 2006. That same year, only 0.5% of the Granville population was foreign, with the presence small Portuguese, Spanish and Moroccan communities each representing 0.1% of the population, far from the regional average of 8.8%, and 16.9% of households consisted of single-parent families, ten points under this same regional average.\n\nAs reflected in the age structure, Granville is an exemplary commune in terms of the age distribution of its inhabitants, each category representing around 15 to 20% of the population. Only the centenarians are poorly represented, as on the whole of the territory. However, a lower rate of children under 15 years in 2006 reflected an ageing of Granville families and a possible future demographic deficit. That same year, only 25.9% of the population was less than 25 years old.\n\nGranville is the chef-lieu of the canton represented by the centre-right Jean-Marc Julienne. The commune is linked to Manche's 2nd constituency represented by deputy Guénhaël Huet (UMP).\n\nThirty-three elected officials sit on the municipal council, divided into twenty-four members of the municipal majority from a list of independents, a group of five councillors of a UDI list, three elected leftists including former PRG mayor Daniel Caruhel and an elected frontist. The board is chaired by a woman, Dominique Baudry, assisted by nine adjoints.\n\nGranville is attached to courts of first instance and the superior court of Avranches, the courts and tribunals of commerce and Council of Tribunals of Coutances, the . INSEE has assigned the code 50 1 15 218.\n\nIn 2008, the town had a budget of €30.041 million, of which €22.08 million for operations and €7,961,000 investment, 38.39% funded by , municipal debt was €15,318,000 the same year.

The bay of Mont Saint-Michel experiences one of the greatest tidal ranges in the world, and this causes strong currents that generate dangerous flows into the international sea routes, adding to the normal tidal flow that goes along the Channel. The area also often experiences fog as well as easterly winds which can create dangerous storms during autumn and winter.\n\nThe waters off Granville are regularly affected by pollution caused by modern shipwrecks, or by illegal fuel tank discharges into the sea.

Declared 1 July 2015, in the sub-prefecture of Avranches, the association law 1901 \"Granville, country of the foreshore\" which comprises the communes of Granville and Saint-Pair-sur-Mer, Jullouville and Carolles, is now the candidacy \"Lands of Art and History\" label.\n\nThe festive year of Granville revolves around various events.

This coat of arms is now of the commune, the azure and Sun symbolising its seaside character, the sword recalling its military past of garrison town.\n\nThe commune also has a flag representing a quarterly of blue and white, with a white cross encircled in blue and charged with a representation of the coat of arms in the centre. It is notably used on the commune's yawls.\n\nGranville is renowned for its marine products, including Granvillaise galette with scallops sprinkled with cream, sea bream in salt crust with virgin sauce (mussels, shrimps, sea snails and whelks), and the Granvillaise sole accompanied with mussels and prawns.

In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the NFL's week 2 games (September 16 and 17) were postponed and rescheduled to the weekend of September 30 and October 1. In order to retain the full playoff format, all playoff games, including Super Bowl XXXVI, were rescheduled one week later. The New England Patriots won the Super Bowl, defeating the St. Louis Rams 20–17 at the Louisiana Superdome.\n\nThe 2001 NFL Draft was held from April 21 to 22, 2001 at New York City's Theater at Madison Square Garden. With the first pick, the Atlanta Falcons selected quarterback Michael Vick from Virginia Tech.\n\nMike Pereira became the league's Director of Officiating, succeeding Jerry Seeman, who had served the role since 1991.\n\nBill Leavy and Terry McAulay were promoted to referee. Phil Luckett returned to back judge, while another officiating crew was added in 2001 in preparation for the Houston Texans expansion team, the league's 32nd franchise, in 2002.\n\nDue to labor dispute, the regular NFL officials were locked out prior to the final week of the preseason. Replacement officials who had worked in college football or the Arena Football League officiated NFL games during the last preseason week and the first week of the regular season. A deal was eventually reached before play resumed after the September 11 attacks.\n\n\nFollowing a pattern set in 1999, the first week of the season was permanently moved to the weekend following Labor Day. With Super Bowls XXXVI-XXXVII already scheduled for fixed dates, the league initially decided to eliminate the Super Bowl bye weeks for 2001 and 2002 to adjust.\n\nIn the wake of the September 11 attacks, the games originally scheduled for September 16 and 17 were postponed and rescheduled to the weekend of January 6 and 7. In order to retain the full playoff format, all playoff games, including the Super Bowl, were rescheduled one week later. The season-ending Pro Bowl was also moved to one week later. This was the last season in which each conference had three divisions, as the conferences would be realigned to four divisions for the 2002 NFL season.\n\nCanceling the games scheduled for September 16 and 17 was considered and rejected since it would have canceled a home game for about half the teams (15 of 31). It would have also resulted in an unequal number of games played: September 16 and 17 was to have been a bye for the San Diego Chargers, so that team would still have played 16 games that season and each of the other teams would have played only 15 games (the Chargers ultimately finished 5–11, making any competitive advantages to playing an extra game irrelevant).\nAs a result of rescheduling Week 2 as Week 17, the Pittsburgh Steelers ended up not playing a home game for the entire month of September (their only home game during that month was originally scheduled for September 16). The ESPN Sunday Night Football game for that week was also changed. It was originally scheduled to be Cleveland at Pittsburgh, but it was replaced with Philadelphia at Tampa Bay, which was seen as a more interesting matchup (it was the only night game the Browns had on the schedule, whereas the Steelers had a few others; so 2000 and 2001 marked the first back-to-back seasons for the Browns without a primetime game since 1974 to 1976; the Browns would finally play in Heinz Field at night in 2003). Ironically, the Eagles and Buccaneers would both rest their starters that night, and would meet one week later in the playoffs. In recognition of this, when NBC began airing Sunday Night Football in 2006, there would be no game initially scheduled for Weeks 11 to 17 – a game initially scheduled in the afternoon would be moved to the primetime slot, without stripping any teams of a primetime appearance. This way of “flexible scheduling” would not be utilized at all in 2007, and since 2008, it is only utilized in the final week.\n\nThe games that eventually made up Week 17 marked the latest regular season games to be played during what is traditionally defined as the \"NFL season\" (under the current format, the regular season cannot end later than January 3 in any given year).\n\nAnother scheduling change took place in October, when the Dallas Cowboys at Oakland Raiders game was moved from October 21 to 7 to accommodate a possible Oakland Athletics home playoff game on the October 21 (the start of Major League Baseball’s postseason was also delayed by the 9/11 attacks due to rescheduling of a week’s worth of games). The rescheduling ended up being unnecessary as the Athletics would not make it past the Division Series round.\n\n\nThe following teams and players set all-time NFL records during the season:\n\n\n\nIn addition, the turf at Veterans Stadium was replaced after a preseason game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Baltimore Ravens is cancelled. Ravens coach Brian Billick told officials of the NFL that he refused to have his team play on a slippery and bouncy turf field which he deemed unsafe.\n\n\nFollowing 9/11, every jersey had a patch to remember those who died on that day, while the New York Jets and New York Giants wore a patch to remember the firefighters who died.\n\n\n"}

The Cleveland Browns returned to the field for the first time since the 1995 season, while the Tennessee Oilers changed their name to \"Tennessee Titans,\" with the league retiring the name “Oilers.”\n\nThe return of the Browns increased the number of teams to 31, the first time the league had played with an odd number of teams since 1966. This required the NFL to give at least one team a bye each week; previously, barring extreme circumstances, a club never received a bye during the first two weeks or last seven weeks of the season.\n\nUnder a new system, for ten weeks of the season (Week #1, Week #2 and Week #10 to Week #17), one team received a bye, and for seven weeks of the season (Week #3 to Week #9), three teams received a bye. This format would continue until the Houston Texans joined the NFL in 2002, returning the league to an even number of teams.\n\nThe start of the 1999 NFL Season was pushed back one week and started the weekend after Labor Day, a change from the previous seasons: due to the Y2K concerns, the NFL did not want to hold the opening round of the playoffs on Saturday January 1, 2000, and did not want teams traveling on that day. This was also done to avoid competing against college football's New Years Day bowl games.\n\nWeek 17 games were held on January 2, 2000, and the opening round of the playoffs would be scheduled for January 8 and 9, with the bye week before the Super Bowl removed to accommodate the one-week adjustment. The start of the season after Labor Day would become a regular fixture for future seasons, beginning in 2001.\n\nThe final spot in the NFC playoffs came down to an exciting final day of the season. The Green Bay Packers and Carolina Panthers were both at 7–8, tied for the last spot in the playoffs with the Dallas Cowboys and tied in other tiebreakers. The Packers/Panthers tie would be broken by best net point differential in conference games. With both the Packers and Panthers playing at 1:00 PM Eastern on January 2, the two teams tried to outscore the other. The Packers beat the Arizona Cardinals 49–24, and the Panthers beat the New Orleans Saints 45–13, with the result that the Packers finished ahead of the Panthers by 11 points. Nevertheless, Dallas defeated the New York Giants later that night to claim the final playoff spot.\n\nThe St. Louis Rams, who had had losing records for each of the past nine seasons dating back to their first tenure in Los Angeles (and had finished in last place in their division the previous season), surprised the entire league by defeating the Tennessee Titans 23–16 in Super Bowl XXXIV at the Georgia Dome.\n\nThe 1999 NFL Draft was held from April 17 to 18, 1999 at New York City's Theater at Madison Square Garden. With the first pick, the Cleveland Browns selected quarterback Tim Couch from the University of Kentucky.\n\nJerry Markbreit retired prior to the 1999 season. He joined the NFL in 1976 as a line judge before being promoted to the referee in just his second year. To date, he is the only NFL referee to officiate four Super Bowl games: Super Bowl XVII, Super Bowl XXI, Super Bowl XXVI, and Super Bowl XXIX.

Established in 1860 as the Great Ducal Saxon Art School, it gained collegiate status on 3 June 1910. In 1919 the school was renamed Bauhaus by its new director Walter Gropius and it received its present name in 1996. Approximately 4,000 students are enrolled at the university today.\nIn 2010 the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar commemorated its 150th anniversary as an art school and college in Weimar.\n\nIn 2019 the university celebrated the centenary of the founding of the Bauhaus, together with partners all over the world.\n\nWeimar boasts a long tradition of art education and instruction in the areas of fine art, handicrafts, music and architecture.\nIn 1776 the Weimar Princely Free Zeichenschule was established, but gradually lost significance after the Grand Ducal Saxon Art School was founded in 1860. The Free Zeichenschule was discontinued in 1930.\nIn 1829 the architect Clemens Wenzeslaus Coudray established the (which later became the Grand Ducal Saxon Architectural Trade School, or State School of Architecture), which operated in the evenings and Sundays and supplemented the courses at the Free Zeichenschule. In 1926, the school was incorporated into the Gotha School of Architecture.\n\nThe Orchestra School, which opened in 1872, eventually became the College of Music Franz Liszt in Weimar.\n\nThe history of the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar goes back to 1860 when Grand Duke Carl Alexander (Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach) founded the Grand Ducal Saxon Art School. Although it became a public institution in 1902, its ties with the ducal house remained strong for years. Students were instructed in a variety of artistic subjects, including landscape, historical, portrait and animal painting, and sculpting. In 1905 the Art School merged with the , which, although integrated into the educational system in a “cooperative relationship between high and applied art”, was independently managed. The school was raised to college status in 1910 and was renamed the \"Grand Ducal Saxon College of Fine Arts\". The development of the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar was also strongly influenced by the which trained artisans in the handicrafts between 1907 and 1915. Both schools issued certificates of participation and conferred diplomas.\n\nThe names of renowned artists, instructors and students can be found in the historical documents and records of both schools.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1919 Walter Gropius merged the College of Fine Arts and the School of Arts and Crafts into the Staatliches Bauhaus in Weimar. It was the making of a new type of art school, a pioneer of modernity, the legacy of which continues to influence the Bauhaus-University Weimar today. In 1923 Gropius summarized his vision with the radical formula “Art and Technology – A New Unity.” His “concept of collaboration with the industry” was strongly opposed, not least of all because he was “determined from the very start to beat down any resistance toward this new kind of architecturally related art.”\n\nThe increasing equalization of professors and workshop instructors and unbridgeable differences made it impossible “for art to develop freely, without purpose and with no connection to architecture at the Bauhaus.” As a result, the State College of Fine Arts was founded in 1921, an institution at which academically traditional masters could work and teach, such as Richard Engelmann, Max Thedy, Walther Klemm, Alexander Olbricht and ( instructor). The Bauhaus only remained in Weimar until spring 1925 when it was forced to relocate to Dessau for political reasons. There the Bauhaus began a new, important chapter as a college of art and design.\n\nUNESCO designated the joint World Heritage Site titled the Bauhaus and its Sites in Weimar, Dessau and Bernau in December 1996. The Bauhaus sites in Weimar that are part of the World Heritage Site are the main building (formerly the \"Grand Ducal Saxon School of Fine Art\") and the Van de Velde building (formerly the \"Grand Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts\") on the Bauhaus University campus, and the Haus am Horn.\n\n\nThe \"State College of Trades and Architecture\", or College of Architecture for short, succeeded the Bauhaus in 1926, which, since the \"State School of Architecture\" had moved to Gotha, offered its own regular postgraduate courses in Architecture in the form both Van de Velde and Gropius had long envisioned. Although the College of Architecture continued to adhere to the idea of the Bauhaus, it offered a much more practical orientation. This corresponded to the “concept of a construction-based, productive working community,” which represented one of the founding principles of this successor institution. The experimental and innovative focus of the Bauhaus fell somewhat to the wayside. In 1929 there were 88 students enrolled at the College of Architecture. After completing their education, graduates received a diploma in the Construction department and the title “Journeyman” or “Master” in their area of handicraft.\n\nPaul Schultze-Naumburg rejected all phenomena of industrial, urban society. He strived to establish a new architectural style that exuded \"“Gemütlichkeit”\", or coziness. In his opinion, it was necessary to preserve the German styles typical of the region, so that people could find identification and orientation in times of rapid social and cultural upheaval. Graduates of the Architecture course received the title “Diplom-Architekt” (certified architect), while artists received a simple certificate and craftspeople received the title “Journeyman” or “Master”.\n\nThe well-known artists and instructors of this period include: Hermann Giesler, Hans Seytter (e.g., Stiftskirche, Stuttgart), Walther Klemm, Alexander Olbricht and .\n\n\nThe institution officially attained college-level status in 1942. By this time, the \"School of Trades\" had been removed from the college, which now called itself the \"College of Architecture and Fine Arts\". After World War II, the Soviet Military Administration of Thuringia oversaw the restructuring of the college to reflect antifascist-democratic principles. Under the aegis of the architect Hermann Henselmann, appointed director in 1946, the college focused its efforts to rebuild the country and pick up where the Bauhaus left off. Some even suggested changing the name of the college to “The Bauhaus – College of Architecture and Handicraft and Engineering Design.”\n\n\nAfter the GDR was established and the East German university system was restructured, the college itself underwent major changes in 1951. The “Fine Arts” department, which had previously been chaired by the sculptor , was dissolved. The new \"College of Architecture\" was placed under the control of the “Ministry of Reconstruction” with the objective to develop academic and research programs for a new technical college of civil engineering.\n\nIn 1954 the college received a rectorial constitution with two new faculties: “Civil Engineering” and “Building Materials Science and Technology”. Otto Englberger, an architect, professor of “Residential and Community Building,” and provisional director of the college since 1951, was appointed the first vice-chancellor of the new \"College of Architecture and Civil Engineering Weimar\" (HAB). In the following decades, the college became one of the leading academic institutions in the field of civil engineering, respected throughout East and West Germany alike.\n\nBecause the college was so integrated in the political system of the GDR, the direction of its instruction and research activities was largely dictated by the government for the purpose of carrying out the latest civil engineering tasks. The third higher education reform of 1968/69 modernized and reorganized the structure of the college based on business administration principles. The faculties were replaced by “sections”, and the college was expanded to include the section of “Computer Technology and Data Processing.” In 1976 research and reception of the Bauhaus was revived at the HAB Weimar. It represented the first step of an ongoing positive re-evaluation of the legacy of the college. Thanks to these research efforts, the college established relations with other institutions, including several in West Germany.\n\nEver since 1951, students in all disciplines were required by East German law to pass a basic study program in Marxist–Leninist philosophy. Later, academic staff, lecturers and professors were also required to complete training on a regular basis. The , which offered these courses at the HAB, was closed in 1990.\n\nThe well-known artists and instructors of this period include: Walther Klemm and Anita Bach (born 1927, first female professor of Architecture in the GDR).\n\n\nThe political of 1989 initiated a radical process of restructuring at the college. The goal was to quickly adapt the college to the basic principles of freedom and democracy and integrate it into the international community of higher education institutions. Several changes were made to its overall structure; redundant departments were merged or dissolved. A new chapter began in 1993 with the establishment of the “Faculty of Art and Design” which reincorporated the artistic disciplines into the academic profile of the college. The establishment of the “Faculty of Media” in 1996 emphasized the college's dedication to progressive thinking. After changing its name to the \"\"Bauhaus-Universität Weimar\"\" in 1996, the university demonstrated its dedication to the spirit of the Bauhaus.\n\nThe well-known artists and instructors of this period include: , and .\n\n\n\nThe university possesses a unique structure with four main faculties. It has fostered a diverse profile of instruction and research based on engineering and architectural disciplines. Today the university offers students a selection of approximately 40 degree programs. The term “Bauhaus” in its name stands for eagerness to experiment, openness, creativity, proximity to industrial practice and internationality.\n\nArchitecture at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar is regarded as a practical science which, in addition to designing the external form of buildings, also focuses on applying various development strategies in urban and rural environments while taking into account the challenges of modernity (energy, environmental pollution, etc.). Students also learn about the function, significance and planning of special buildings and facilities (such as hospitals).\n\nStudent enrolment at the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism: 1,178 (winter semester 2013/14)\n\nDegree programs:\n\nThe faculty has been expanding and developing in the field of civil engineering for almost six decades. Civil engineers and engineers from related disciplines have left a lasting imprint on the development of cities and rural areas through, among other things, innovative water treatment concepts for developing countries, high-tech building materials for eco-friendly construction, the development of energetic renovation methods and novel bridge constructions.\n\nStudent enrolment at the Faculty of Civil Engineering: 1,067 (winter semester 2013/14)\n\nDegree programs:\n\n\nThe goal of instruction and research in this faculty is to envision and design human living environments. The academic programs focus mainly on recognizing and promoting creative and intellectual strengths and searching for ways to put them to practical use.\n\nStudent enrolment at the Faculty of Art and Design: 610 (winter semester 2013/14)\n\nDegree programs:\n\n\nThe Faculty of Art and Design has been using the studios and classrooms in the former School of Arts and Crafts (Van de Velde Building) since 1996. Following a renovation phase lasting two years, the Faculty of Art and Design returned to the Van de Velde Building in April 2010. In November 2013, the faculty celebrated its 20th anniversary with the festival week.\n\nThe Faculty of Media, still unique in German university education, now has a 21-year history to look back upon. By founding the faculty in 1996, the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar responded to the ever-growing significance of media for the sciences, society and the economy. The faculty meets the contemporary challenges of media-economic, media-cultural and media-technological natures with an interdisciplinary approach in the best Bauhaus tradition—by interweaving science and technology. The faculty fosters the growth of creative media artists with strong science backgrounds in self-designed project-based courses. Its graduates are active in the media-, culture- and telecommunication industries, as well as in research and instruction.\n\nStudent enrolment at the Faculty of Media: 652 (winter semester 2016/17)\n\nDegree programs:\n\n\nInternational degree programs:\n\n\nFollowing German reunification, a vacated industrial facility in the vicinity of the historic center of Weimar near the Frauenplan and Goethe's house was chosen as the site of a new library and lecture hall for the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar.\n\nFollowing an urban planning competition in 1991, the architects’ office (Munich) were commissioned to design the building. After a four-year construction phase costing 12 million euros, the new university library and an integrated main auditorium were officially opened in 2005, and in 2006, the building was awarded the .\n\nWith over 5,000 m of usable floor space, the library houses a collection of approximately 488,500 books and other media (as of 2013).\n\nOn the initiative of the student government, the Vice-Chancellor's office and the Klassik Stiftung Weimar agreed to provide university students with an exhibition venue.\n\n\nWeimar is home to several student faith organizations, such as the and “Thomas Aquinas” and (SfC), a German chapter of Chi Alpha Campus Ministries.\n\n\n\n"}

She was a figure of some public notoriety after her 1905 marriage to Episcopal millionaire J. G. Phelps Stokes, a member of elite New York society, who supported the settlements in New York. Together they joined the Socialist Party. Pastor Stokes continued to be active in labor politics and women's issues, including promoting access to birth control, which was highly controversial at the time.\n\nIn 1919, Pastor Stokes was a founding member of the Communist Party of America and helped develop it into the 1930s. In addition to her writing on politics, she wrote poetry and plays; one was produced in 1916 by the Washington Square Players. She started her autobiography in 1924 but had not completed it at her death; it was published in 1992.\n\nRose Harriet Wieslander was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Augustów, in the Russian Empire (present-day Poland) on July 18, 1879, the daughter of Jacob and Hindl (later known as Anna) Wieslander. Her mother had loved a Catholic man, but her father refused to allow her to marry him. Rose's parents separated after she was born, and her father emigrated to the United States. In 1882 when Rose was three, her mother emigrated with her parents and child to London. There Anna married Israel Pastor, who gave his surname to his stepdaughter Rose. They had six children together. The family lived in the East End, a neighborhood of poor immigrants. Rose Pastor attended classes for a time at the Bell Lane Free School. (Israel Zangwill was once a pupil there and later an instructor.)\n\nIn 1891, when Pastor was twelve, her family emigrated to Cleveland, Ohio in the United States. In 1892 she took a job in a Cleveland cigar factory, where she worked as a cigar maker for the next eleven years. According to a 1910 \"New York Times\" article, her stepfather was reported as having died a few years after the family arrived in Cleveland. Pastor helped support her six siblings and mother.\n\nDuring this time, Pastor discovered her talent for writing. Responding to a solicitation by the \"Yiddishe Tageblatt\" (\"Jewish Daily News,\" based in New York City) for letters from Jewish workers, she submitted a letter. When it was published, she was encouraged to write more. The paper continued to publish her letters, where she expressed her ideas about the working class. The \"Jewish Daily News\" hired her on staff and she moved to New York in 1903. She became a columnist in the English-language section, offering advice to other young women. She also wrote human interest features. The paper was published mostly in Yiddish. With a salary of $15 a week, after a couple of years, Pastor had saved enough to bring her mother and siblings from Cleveland to New York City.\n\nIn July 1903, Pastor was assigned to interview J. G. Phelps Stokes, known by friends as \"Graham,\" a prominent, wealthy, upper-class businessman who supported a settlement house on the Lower East Side. He had gained media attention because of his high social status and his charitable work for the needy. Descended from families prominent since the colonial history of New England, Stokes was a railway president, Episcopalian, and a society figure. He gave up his mansion at 299 Madison Avenue to be closer to the work he found most satisfying, that of social projects. Stokes moved to the University Settlement on the Lower East Side, which ministered to the masses of new immigrants from Europe. It was near the \"Jewish Daily News\". Pastor praised Stokes' ideals in her article.\n\nSoon Pastor also became active in work of University Settlement. Her friendship with Stokes deepened, and in early 1905 they announced their engagement. The couple were married in July 1905 and joined the Socialist Party of America together soon thereafter. He was Episcopalian; they did not practice either religion but devoted themselves to Socialism.\n\nIn September 1905, together with Upton Sinclair, Jack London, Clarence Darrow, and Florence Kelley, Graham Phelps Stokes helped found the Intercollegiate Socialist Society (ISS) to encourage study and discussion of socialism in colleges. Over the next decade, both Graham and Rose lectured frequently on socialist themes on behalf of the ISS on college campuses around America. \nIn 1909 a few years after their marriage, the Stokeses moved to a house in Westport, Connecticut, where Rose was integrated into her husband's circle of intellectual socialists, including William English Walling, Anna Strunsky Walling and Helen Stokes. Both Graham and Rose Stokes continued their activities on behalf of the Socialist movement. She frequently traveled around the country to speak and debate about the cause and helped picket, strike and organize for specific events. She wrote regularly for the \"New York Call\".\n\nIn 1909 Pastor Stokes took part in the Shirtwaist Strike, to show support for the 40,000 garment workers in New York. She attracted media attention because of her marriage to Graham Phelps Stokes, and reporters came to cover her appearance at the strike headquarters at Clinton Hall. She said, \"My ideal is that we all be economically interdependent. We should not be independent like millionaires, nor dependent like laborers. My ideal is that we all be interdependent. And I'm not working in a losing cause.\"\n\nIn May and June 1912, Pastor Stokes helped lead a strike by the New York City restaurant and hotel workers. In the winter of 1913, she aided the New York garment workers in another \"bitter strike.\" Graham began to devote more time to writing, but Rose continued her activism. She distributed birth control information, and frequently organized meetings with Margaret Sanger and Emma Goldman, who led efforts for women to have birth control.\n\nShe also continued writing, contributing poetry to such publications as \"The Masses\", \"Independent\" and \"The Century Magazine\". During this period she also wrote several plays; \"The Woman Who Wouldn't\" (1916), about a labor leader, was produced by the Washington Square Players.\n\nIn 1917 the Socialists denounced the American war program. But Graham Stokes withdrew from the party and joined the Armed Forces of the United States. At first Rose also left the Socialists, as she was disappointed with the party's official position on the war, endorsing \"active interference with the war effort\". She believed that Germany was a threat to democratic nations. Shortly she rejoined the Socialists, as she doubted whether President Woodrow Wilson's policies furthered international democracy. She became associated with the left wing of the Socialists. In 1919, she was among the founders of the American Communist Party.\n\nPastor Stokes began to travel throughout the United States, speaking and contributing articles to various newspapers. In 1918, after her comments following a speech in Kansas City were incorrectly reported, Pastor Stokes wrote a letter to the editor of the \"Kansas City Star\" in which she criticized US involvement in World War I. She accused the US government of being allied with profiteers. Controversy over the letter led to a federal indictment for violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Pastor Stokes was tried and convicted in Kansas City, Missouri. This was one of several indictments of activist women during the World War I years. Their criticism of the war threatened the national power of the patriotic mothers.\n\nAfter being sentenced to 10 years in Missouri State prison, Pastor Stokes and her attorney, Seymour Stedman of Chicago, Illinois, successfully appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Paul, Minnesota. In reaction to this, Pastor Stokes moved to the left in her political leanings. The government ultimately dismissed the case against her in 1920. Judge Walter H. Sanborn authored the opinion that overturned the decision, citing a bias by the District Judge. Despite tensions due to their differing positions on World War I, relations between Pastor Stokes and her husband were relatively congenial.\n\nGraham had been embarrassed before World War I by her public activism related to birth control, not widely accepted, and labor politics. Some of his family were among those who were quite opposed to her politics. With increasing strain between them, in 1925 Graham brought a petition for divorce in Nyack, New York, on grounds of \"misconduct by his wife\". He won a decree. Pastor Stokes issued a statement denouncing New York's divorce laws, and saying that she and her husband had lived as \"friendly enemies\" for some time. She said she would cherish her freedom. \n\nBy 1929 Pastor Stokes had remarried. Her second husband was Jerome Isaac Romain, a Polish-Russian Jewish immigrant and a language teacher who was seventeen years younger than she. He was an active member of the Communist Party and became its cultural chief in New York. He later changed his name to Victor Jeremy Jerome, called V.J., serving as editor for decades for \"Political Affairs\". The couple lived at 215 Second Avenue in the Lower East Side. But Pastor Stokes also kept her cottage in Westport, and frequently lived there.\n\nAfter World War I, Pastor Stokes had left the Socialist Party again; in 1919, she became a founding member of the Communist Party of America and helped develop it into the 1930s. In 1922, she traveled to Moscow as an American delegate to the Fourth Congress of the Communist International (Comintern). She served there as the reporter for the special Negro Commission at the Congress and adopted the pseudonym \"Sasha\". After returning to the United States, Stokes was elected to the Executive Committee of the newly formed Workers' Party.\n\nShe participated in strikes and made court appearances to support men and women arrested for picketing and/or demonstrating. In 1929 she was arrested for demonstrating during a garment workers' strike. Due to her years of working with activists of the Lower East Side, she was called \"Rose of the Ghetto\".\n\nPastor Stokes was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1930. In 1933 she went to Germany for radiation therapy. In April 1933 friends collected funds for hospital expenses. Pastor Stokes entered Municipal Hospital in Frankfurt, Germany, on April 15, where she was operated on for cancer by Professor Vito Schmiden. While under treatment, she died in the hospital on June 20, 1933, aged 53. Her body was cremated and the ashes sent to New York, where a memorial service was held at Webster Hall.\n\nAt the time of death, Pastor Stokes was working on her autobiography, which she had started in 1924. Before her death, she had sent numerous documents related to her writing to her agents in the United States. She asked her friend Samuel Ornitz, also a communist and a writer, to complete it, sharing her views with him.\n\nHe finally abandoned the work in 1937. During the 1950s, he was among the Hollywood Ten, blacklisted after their refusal to testify to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) during the Joseph McCarthy era of a Red scare. \n\nHer unfinished autobiography was published posthumously in 1992 by an academic press. Pastor Stokes' personal papers are held by New York University, where they are held at the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives, and at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Much of this material is also available on microfilm. \n\n\n\n"}

Fouda does not consider his interview with the 9/11 orchestrators as a turning point in his career; instead he believes it introduced him to an international audience.\n\nIt has been suggested that Fouda gave away the hideaway location of bin al‑Shibh to Aljazeera's chairman Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani, a cousin of the Emir of Qatar, and that CIA director George Tenet received the location tip-off from the Emir, resulting in bin al‑Shibh's capture.\n\nIn 2006, Fouda, in charge of Aljazeera's London bureau, broke the story on the \"martyrdom video\" by \"9/11 hijackers\" Mohamed Atta and Ziad Jarrah.\n\nFouda resigned from Aljazeera in 2009, almost two years before the 2011 Egyptian revolution that toppled former president Hosni Mubarak. His resignation was driven by his disagreement with the inter-politics of the news agency, along with his feeling that an important event will soon take place in Egypt. Soon after his resignation, Fouda joined ONTV to host a talk show \"Last Words\" (اخر كلام).\n\nFouda joined the politically independent Egyptian channel in 2010. Although he received numerous \"tempting\" offers from Aljazeera rivals, Fouda chose to return to Egypt. ONTV was still a new channel with a small budget, but he believed in the channels administration and founder Naguib Sawiris - a renowned Egyptian businessman.\n\nFouda supported the revolution from day one, and offered an uninterrupted coverage of the Tahrir Square protests. Although he did not join the protests in Tahrir, he believed that his role should be in reporting and broadcasting the events as they unfold. His show gained massive popularity in Egypt during and after the revolution, and was at the top of TV show ratings. Fouda had interesting thoughts about the post-revolution Egypt, where he stated in an interview with Stephen Sackur that very little had changed in Egypt since the revolution, and that the ex-regime is still around and it should be preserved.\n\nHis show constantly criticized Egypt's former military rulers and in October 2011, Fouda suspended his show in protest of what he called the \"efforts by the country's military rulers to stifle free expression\". He said \"This is my way of self-censorship, either to say the truth or to be silent\". The show went off air for three weeks and was resumed on November 13, 2011. At the start of his episode Fouda stressed that he stopped his program for three weeks to \"prove a stance\", and that his allegiance is always to \"right and truth\". On May 17 Fouda stated on his Twitter account that he will end the show in six weeks, but he then decided to continue for another year. The show was suspended again on late June, 2012. He did not offer a clear explanation of the reasons and chose to briefly tweet “I’ve stopped my show because I respect you, the details concern me alone. The only thing that matters for the viewer is my work”. The show resumed in September, 2012.\n\nIn September 2018, Fouda parted ways with German broadcaster Deutsche Welle in controversial circumstances that are now the subject of legal action.\n\nYosri Fouda authored and co-authored a collection of three books. In May 2003, Fouda alongside Nick Fielding published \"Masterminds of Terror: The Truth Behind the Most Devastating Terrorist Attack the World Has Ever Seen\". Almost a year and a half later he published \"Serri lel-Ghaya\" meaning \"Highly confidential\", a seven part sequel, which includes a collection of carefully selected investigations. The sequel offers a deeper insight about various events discussed earlier in his show, and grants the reader access to secret reports, testimonies and evidences. This collection was published by the World Book Publishing in Beirut, and is only available in Arabic.\n\n\"Capture or Kill: The Pursuit of the 9/11 Masterminds and the Killing of Osama bin Laden\" (updated edition 2012, Arcade Publishing, ) is Fouda's second collaboration with the British investigative journalist Nick Fielding. In 2015, Fouda authored \"In Harm's Way: From the Stronghold of al-Qaida to the Heart of ISIL\" book, it was published by \"Dar El Shourok\" in Cairo and is available in Arabic language. In 2016, he authored another book called \"The last words: A testimony of hope in the Egyptian Revolution.\"\n\nOn Sunday March 24, 2013 Fouda fractured his neck in a car accident near the Red Sea resort town of Hurghada. He was transported to the Gouna Hospital and his situation was reported to be stable.\n\n\n"}

It is the second largest establishment of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), next to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), located at Kalpakkam, 80 km south of Chennai, India. It was established in 1971 as an exclusive centre dedicated to the pursuit of fast reactor science and technology, due to the vision of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai. Originally, it was called as Reactor Research Centre (RRC). It was renamed as Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR) by the then Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi in December 1985. The centre is engaged in broad-based multidisciplinary programme of scientific research and advanced engineering directed towards the development of Fast Breeder Reactor technology, in India.\n\nThe present Director of IGCAR is A. K. Bhaduri. He has taken over as Director with effect from 1 July 2016, following the superannuation of Dr. S. A. V. Satya Murty.\n\nThe fast reactor related research in India, originated at BARC, Mumbai. Later, RRC was established at Kalpakkam with the same mandate. The Central Workshop, Safety Research Laboratory and Materials Sciences Laboratory were constructed in 1975–1976. Soon, the Radio-Chemistry Lab and Electronics and Instrumentation Lab were constructed.\n\nThe centre houses a Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR), which attained its first criticality in October 1985.\n\nA few years later, in 1994, SQUID, ASIC and Diamond Anvil Cells were developed. In the same year, High-Power Physics and Engineering Experiments were undertaken in the FBTR.\n\nIn 1996, KAMINI reactor reached criticality. State-of-the-art Neutronic Channels were commissioned for FBTR in 1999.\n\nA Boron-Enrichment Plant was commissioned in April 2001.\n\nA BARC Training School was started in 2006. In 2009, FBTR was operated at a maximum power level of 18.6 MWt with 55 sub-assemblies for 1732 hours.\n\n\nThe facility houses two PHWRs that generate 220MWe each that operate for commercial purposes. These are managed independently by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India.\n\nThere are three research reactors at IGCAR.\n\n\nIn addition, the Research Facility also built the 100MWe reactor for India's first nuclear submarine the Arihant class submarine project and operated it on land for testing purposes since it attained criticality in December 2004. The submarine launched on 26 July 2009 has this reactor.\n\nThe Kalpakkam Atomic Reprocessing Plant [KARP] facility has been estimated to have a capacity to reprocess 100 tonnes of spent fuel plutonium per annum.it incorporates a number of innovative features such as hybrid maintenance concept in hot cells using servo-manipulators and engineered provisions for extending the life of the plant. This plant will cater to the needs of reprocessing fuels from MAPS as well as FBTR. It has mastered the technology of reprocessing highly irradiated mixed carbide fuel for the first time in the world. \n\nReprocessing Development Laboratory was designed in early seventies and the commissioning of inactive facilities was carried\nout in 1976. The plutonium handling facilities were cleared for operation in 1980. The reprocessing of irradiated thorium rods which was carried out during the period 1989 to 1992 in the concrete shielded cells, was the first major radioactive operation. The U-233 recovered during the operation was used in fabricating the fuel for the KAlpakkam MINI reactor (KAMINI). U-233 was also useful for the fuel development programme for carrying out the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor test fuel irradiation experiments in Fast Breeder Test Reactor. Apart from this, the operation aided in validating the equipment and design of system as well as the manpower training. Later a hot cell facility for reprocessing of Fast Breeder Test Reactor fuel was conceived which had the necessary features for delivering the product with all the uncertainties in the dissolution of irradiated fuel and process flowsheet. Added to this was the need for the deployment of the yet to be proven designs of centrifuge and centrifugal extractors without which the success of the PUREX process for fast reactor fuel reprocessing would be doubtful. With these minimal inputs, the hot cell facility, Lead Mini Cell (LMC) was created, which was later rechristened as CORAL (COmpact Reprocessing facility for Advanced fuels in Lead cells). Based on the dissolution experiments carried out on unirradiated single pellets and systematic studies related to the third phase formation, the flow sheet, prepared earlier for the oxide fuel was modified.\n\nChemistry Group: Presently there are 4 subdivisions: Fuel Chemistry Division (FChD), Materials Chemistry Division (MCD), and Chemical Facilities Division (CFD). Facilities include Far-IR Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer, Fluorimeter RF-5000, Impedance Spectrometer and Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS), Alpha Spectrometer, Liquid Scintillation Counter, High Purity Germanium Detector, Neutron Counter ED-XRF, HPLC, SFC, Ion Chromatography, Gas Chromatography etc.Among various achievements of the Group, Radioisotope production for medicinal importance is the ongoing important projects and has societal impact.\n\nElectronics, Instrumentation and Radiological Safety Group:\n\nElectronics, Instrumentation and Radiological Safety Group consists of Instrumentation & Control Group and Radiological Safety & Environmental Group, Computer Division and Security Electronics Section.\n\nMajor activities of this group include: \nEngineering Services Group: Includes Central Workshop, Electrical Services and Civil Engineering Section.\n\nFast Reactor Technology Group: Some activities include\n\nMetallurgy and Materials Group: This group works consists of the\n\nMaterials Science Group: This group consists of\n\nNuclear & Safety Engineering Group: The objectives of the N&SEG are\n\nReactor Engineering Group\n\nReactor Operation & Maintenance Group: The Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR), the flagship of this centre and Kalpakkam Mini Reactor (KAMINI) come under this group. Reactor Operation and Maintenance Group consists of Reactor Operation Division (ROD), Reactor Maintenance Division (RMD), Technical Services Division (TSD) and Training & Human Resources Development Division (THRDD). Quality Assurance and Industrial Safety Section (QA&IS) and Liaison Cell are also coming under this group. Operation and maintenance of both FBTR & KAMINI reactors, planning and conducting irradiation programmes, reactor physics tests and engineering tests, manpower planning & training for FBTR and PFBR (BHAVINI), maintenance of chemical parameters of the coolants, periodic safety revaluation are carried out by ROMG.\n\nReprocessing Group: It is pursuing research and development of equipment and processes. It is also running a pilot plant for FBTR Fuel processing, constructing demo plant for FBTR and PFBR fuel reprocessing and designing the PFBR reprocessing plant.\n\nFast Reactor Fuel Cycle Facility\n\nStrategic & Human Resources Planning Section\n\nThe Centre has a staff strength of 2514 including 1243 Engineers and Scientists.\n\nThe annual outlay of the Centre is around 8450 Million INR towards its Research & Development activities and plan.\n\nThe interaction with IIT-M started in 1995 through two collaborative projects, which were initiated with late Dr. R.S. Alwar, eminent\nprofessor in Applied Mechanics. The first project was on simulation of thermal shock on the control plug mockup and the second was\non simulation of thermal striping in the core structure. An MoU was established on 19 July 1997 for the formation of ‘IGCAR- IITM\nCell’ with Prof. R. Natarajan (then Director, IIT-M) as chairman and late Dr. Placid Rodriguez as Co-Chairman. Prof. K.V.S. Rama Rao\nwas Dean, ICSR during that period. In the first cell meeting held on 26 February 1997, seven projects were identified. Based on the\ndecisions taken in the meeting, four projects with a funding to the tune of eighty eight lakhs were sanctioned. In the past thirteen years,\ntwenty five meetings of the IGCAR-IITM cell have been conducted. Already twenty nine projects have been completed with the funds to the tune of 40.5 million and fifteen projects are in progress with a funding of 34 million.\nIndira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam, has entered into a collaboration with the IIT Kharagpur to carry out research related to the design and development of Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs). A dedicated IGCAR-IITKGP R&D cell has been set up in the premises of IIT Kharagpur under the Advanced Technology Development Centre's Structural Reliability Research Facility of IIT KGP.\n\nIGCAR has a BARC Training School where young science post graduates and engineering graduates are trained in multiple disciplines for a period of one year.\n\n"}
{"id": "2310971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2310971", "title": "Gauss's lemma (polynomial)", "text": "Gauss's lemma (polynomial)\n\nIn algebra, Gauss's lemma, named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, is a statement about polynomials over the integers, or, more generally, over a unique factorization domain (that is, a ring that has a unique factorization property similar to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic). Gauss's lemma underlies all the theory of factorization and greatest common divisors of such polynomials.\n\nGauss's lemma asserts that the product of two primitive polynomials is primitive (a polynomial with integer coefficients is \"primitive\" if it has 1 as a greatest common divisor of its coefficients).\n\nA corollary of Gauss's lemma, sometimes also called \"Gauss's lemma\", is that a primitive polynomial is irreducible over the integers if and only if it is irreducible over the rational numbers. More generally, a primitive polynomial has the same complete factorization over the integers and over the rational numbers. In the case of coefficients in a unique factorization domain , \"rational numbers\" must be replaced by \"field of fractions of \". This implies that, if is either a field, the ring of integers, or a unique factorization domain, then every polynomial ring (in one or several indeterminates) over is a unique factorization domain. Another consequence is that factorization and greatest common divisor computation of polynomials with integers or rational coefficients may be reduced to similar computations on integers and primitive polynomials. This is systematically used (explicitly or implicitly) in all implemented algorithms (see Polynomial greatest common divisor and Factorization of polynomials).\n\nGauss's lemma, and all its consequences that do not involve the existence of a complete factorization remain true over any GCD domain (an integral domain over which greatest common divisors exist). In particular, a polynomial ring over a GCD domain is also a GCD domain. If one calls \"primitive\" a polynomial such that the coefficients generate the unit ideal, Gauss's lemma is true over every commutative ring. However, some care must be taken, when using this definition of \"primitive\", as, over a unique factorization domain that is not a principal ideal domain, there are polynomials that are primitive in the above sense and not primitive in this new sense.\n\nIf formula_1 is a polynomial with integer coefficients, then formula_2 is called \"primitive\" if the greatest common divisor of all the coefficients formula_3 is 1; in other words, no prime number divides all the coefficients.\n\nProof: Clearly the product \"f\"(\"x\").\"g\"(\"x\") of two primitive polynomials has integer coefficients. Therefore, if it is not primitive, there must be a prime \"p\" which is a common divisor of all its coefficients. But \"p\" can not divide all the coefficients of either \"f\"(\"x\") or \"g\"(\"x\") (otherwise they would not be primitive). Let \"ax\" be the first term of \"f\"(\"x\") not divisible by \"p\" and let \"bx\" be the first term of \"g\"(\"x\") not divisible by \"p\". Now consider the term \"x\" in the product. Its coefficient must take the form:\n\nThe first term is not divisible by \"p\" (because \"p\" is prime), yet all the remaining ones are, so the entire sum cannot be divisible by \"p\". By assumption all coefficients in the product are divisible by \"p\", leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the coefficients of the product can have no common divisor and are thus primitive. formula_5\n\nThe proof is given below for the more general case. Note that an irreducible element of Z (a prime number) is still irreducible when viewed as constant polynomial in Z[\"X\"]; this explains the need for \"non-constant\" in the statement.\n\nGauss's lemma holds more generally over arbitrary unique factorization domains. There the \"content\" of a polynomial can be defined as the greatest common divisor of the coefficients of (like the gcd, the content is actually a set of associate elements). A polynomial with coefficients in a UFD is then said to be primitive if the only elements of that divide all coefficients of at once are the invertible elements of ; i.e., the gcd of the coefficients is one.\n\nPrimitivity statement: If is a UFD, then the set of primitive polynomials in is closed under multiplication. More generally, the content of a product formula_6 of polynomials is the product formula_7 of their contents.\n\nIrreducibility statement: Let be a unique factorization domain and its field of fractions. A non-constant polynomial formula_8 in formula_9 is irreducible in formula_9 if and only if it is both irreducible in formula_11 and primitive in formula_9.\n\nLet formula_13 be a unique factorization domain with field of fractions formula_2. If formula_15 is a polynomial over formula_2, then, for some formula_17, formula_18 has coefficients in formula_13 and so, factoring-out the gcd formula_20 of the coefficients, we can write: formula_21 for some primitive polynomial formula_22. As one can check, this polynomial formula_23 is unique up to the multiplication by a unit element and is called the primitive part (or primitive representative) of formula_8 and is denoted by formula_25. The procedure is compatible with product: formula_26.\n\nThe construct can be used to show the statement:\nIndeed, by induction, it is enough to show formula_9 is a UFD when formula_13 is a UFD. Let formula_29 be a nonzero polynomial. Now, formula_11 is a unique factorization domain (since it is a principal ideal domain) and so, as a polynomial in formula_11, formula_8 can be factorized as:\nwhere formula_34 are irreducible polynomials of formula_11. Now, we write formula_36 for the gcd formula_37 of the coefficients of formula_8 (and formula_23 is the primitive part) and then:\n\nNow, formula_37 is a product of prime elements of formula_13 (since formula_13 is a UFD) and a prime element of formula_13 is a prime element of formula_9, as formula_46 is an integral domain. Hence, formula_37 admits a prime factorization (or a unique factorization into irreducibles). Next, observe that formula_48 is a unique factorization into irreducible elements of formula_9, as (1) each formula_50 is irreducible by the irreducibility statement and (2) it is unique since the factorization of formula_23 can also be viewed as a factorization in formula_11 and factorization there is unique. Since formula_53 are uniquely determined by formula_8, up to unit elements, the above factorization of formula_8 is a unique factorization into irreducible elements. formula_5\n\nThe condition that \"\"R\" is a unique factorization domain\" is not superfluous because it implies that every irreducible element of this ring is also a prime element, which in turn implies that every nonzero element of \"R\" has at most one factorization into a product of irreducible elements and a unit up to order and associate relationship. In a ring where factorization is not unique, say with \"p\" and \"q\" irreducible elements that do not divide any of the factors on the other side, the product shows the failure of the primitivity statement. For a concrete example one can take , , , , . In this example the polynomial (obtained by dividing the right hand side by ) provides an example of the failure of the irreducibility statement (it is irreducible over \"R\", but reducible over its field of fractions ). Another well known example is the polynomial , whose roots are the golden ratio and its conjugate showing that it is reducible over the field , although it is irreducible over the non-UFD which has as field of fractions. In the latter example the ring can be made into an UFD by taking its integral closure in (the ring of Dirichlet integers), over which becomes reducible, but in the former example \"R\" is already integrally closed.\n\nLet formula_13 be a commutative ring. If formula_8 is a polynomial in formula_59, then we write formula_60 for the ideal of formula_13 generated by all the coefficients of formula_8; it is called the content of formula_8. Note that formula_64 for each formula_65. The next proposition states a more substantial property.\n\nA polynomial formula_8 is said to be \"primitive\" if formula_67 is the unit ideal. When formula_68 (or more generally a Bézout domain), this agrees with the usual definition of a primitive polynomial. (But if formula_13 is only a UFD, this definition is inconsistent with the definition of primitivity in #Statements for unique factorization domains.)\n\n\"Proof:\" This is easy using the fact that formula_70 implies formula_71 formula_5\n\n\"Proof:\" (formula_73) First note that the gcd of the coefficients of formula_8 is 1 since, otherwise, we can factor out some element formula_75 from the coefficients of formula_8 to write formula_77, contradicting the irreducibility of formula_8. Next, suppose formula_79 for some non-constant polynomials formula_80 in formula_81. Then, for some formula_17, the polynomial formula_83 has coefficients in formula_13 and so, by factoring out the gcd formula_20 of the coefficients, we write formula_86. Do the same for formula_87 and we can write formula_88 for some formula_89. Now, let formula_90 for some formula_91. Then formula_92. From this, using the proposition, we get:\nThat is, formula_94 divides formula_95. Thus, formula_75 and then the factorization formula_88 constitutes a contradiction to the irreducibility of formula_8.\n\n(formula_99) If formula_8 is irreducible over formula_2, then either it is irreducible over formula_13 or it contains a constant polynomial as a factor, the second possibility is ruled out by the assumption. formula_5\n\n\"Proof of the proposition:\" Clearly, formula_104. If formula_105 is a prime ideal containing formula_106, then formula_107 modulo formula_105. Since formula_109 is a polynomial ring over an integral domain and thus is an integral domain, this implies either formula_110 or formula_111 modulo formula_105. Hence, either formula_60 or formula_114 is contained in formula_105. Since formula_116 is the intersection of all prime ideals that contain formula_106 and the choice of formula_118 was arbitrary, formula_119.\n\nWe now prove the \"moreover\" part. Factoring out the gcd’s from the coefficients, we can write formula_120 and formula_121 where the gcds of the coefficients of formula_122 are both 1. Clearly, it is enough to prove the assertion when formula_123 are replaced by formula_122; thus, we assume the gcd's of the coefficients of formula_123 are both 1. The rest of the proof is easy and transparent if formula_13 is a unique factorization domain; thus we give the proof in that case here (and see for the proof for the GCD case). If formula_127, then there is nothing to prove. So, assume otherwise; then there is a non-unit element dividing the coefficients of formula_6. Factorizing that element into a product of prime elements, we can take that element to be a prime element formula_129. Now, we have:\nThus, either formula_131 contains formula_60 or formula_114; contradicting the gcd's of the coefficients of formula_123 are both 1. formula_5\n\n\nIt follows from Gauss's lemma that for each unique factorization domain formula_13, the polynomial ring formula_139 is also a unique factorization domain (see #Statements for unique factorization domains). Gauss's lemma can also be used to show Eisenstein's irreducibility criterion. Finally, it can be used to show that cyclotomic polynomials (unitary units with integer coefficients) are irreducible.\n\nGauss's lemma implies the following statement:\nIf formula_68, then it says a rational root of a monic polynomial over integers is an integer (cf. the rational root theorem). To see the statement, let formula_147 be a root of formula_8 in formula_2 and assume formula_150 are relatively prime. In formula_11, we can write formula_152 with formula_153 for some formula_75. Then\nis a factorization in formula_9. But formula_157 is primitive (in the UFD sense) and thus formula_158 divides the coefficients of formula_159 by Gauss's lemma and so\nwith formula_87 in formula_9. Since formula_8 is monic, this is possible only when formula_94 is a unit.\n\nA similar argument shows:\n\nThe irreducibility statement also implies that the minimal polynomial over the rational numbers of an algebraic integer has integer coefficients.\n\n"}

This was DePatie–Freleng's first vehicle for Saturday morning. Only one season of the show was produced, but NBC ran the series for three years in the same timeslot.\n\nThe show was a superhero spoof which featured six diverse characters working for Super Services Inc., offering \"heroes for hire\" under the supervision of the cranky Super Chief. Each episode consisted of three five- to six-minute segments, with the introductory segment featuring Super Bwoing and the last featuring one of the other five heroes. The middle segment featured the unrelated \"The Brothers Matzoriley.\"\n\n\"The Super 6\" theme song was performed by Gary Lewis & the Playboys.\n\n\"The Super 6\" consisted of the following:\n\n\nThis character appeared in the smallest number of segments of any of the other members of the Super 6. After his first appearance, however, his name was changed from \"Whammo\" to \"Zammo\". According to Friz Freleng in a [1982] interview, the name change occurred when Wham-O, creators of such toys as the Super Ball, filed a legal grievance against DePatie-Freleng over trademark infringement. Reportedly, the first commercial to air after the first televised “Captain Whammo” segment was, ironically, for the Super Ball.\n\nThis third segment was unrelated to the Super 6, and starred a bizarre, three-headed character known collectively as \"The Brothers Matzoriley\" a parody in name, of The Brothers Karamazov. They were \"Siamese triplets\" who were Three Stooges-style bumblers, always looking for a new job. Their names (Weft, Wight and Wong) were a play on \"left\", \"right\" and \"wrong\", respectively. Although occupying one body, each head had its own distinct personality, one head (Weft) being that of a tough guy with a Brooklyn accent, another (Wight) being a wimpy coward with a very nervous delivery, and the middle head (Wong) being a smart alecky Chinese, who dispensed absurd parodies of Confucius proverbs beginning with \"Confusion say...\". All three personalities were of a broad, stereotypical nature.\n\nA prototype version of the Brothers Matzoriley first appeared in the credits of \"A Shot in the Dark\" and again in \"The Great De Gaulle Stone Operation\" (the first short in \"The Inspector\" series). In the cartoon, the brothers steal a precious diamond in the oddest ways from the Inspector. In a comic plot twist ending, they wind up winning the day after the Inspector accidentally drinks a glass of water with the diamond in it. The brothers (disguised as a nurse) steal it after a surgeon removes it during an emergency operation. This version of the character was quite different from its later incarnation, however. The first head was a suave British-type (Pat Harrington Jr. was the original voice for the left head) and the third head had a Soviet-Russian accent (Paul Frees was the voice of the right head, as well as the middle Chinese head). They had different voices, but similar personalities - although the middle Chinese head bore some resemblance to the version that would later appear in \"The Super 6\".\n\nThe series was broadcast by NBC from September 10, 1966 to January 21, 1967. NBC continued to air reruns until August 31, 1969.\n\n20 episodes (each containing three cartoons) were made.\n\nTGG Direct (under license from MGM Home Entertainment) has released the entire series on DVD.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In his call for freedom, it is perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent resistance.\n\nThe poem was not published during Shelley's lifetime and did not appear in print until 1832 (see 1832 in poetry), when published by Edward Moxon in London with a preface by Leigh Hunt. Shelley had sent the manuscript in 1819 for publication in \"The Examiner\". Leigh Hunt withheld it from publication because he \"thought that the public at large had not become sufficiently discerning to do justice to the sincerity and kind-heartedness of the spirit that walked in this flaming robe of verse.\" The epigraph on the cover of the first edition is from \"The Revolt of Islam\" (1818): \"Hope is strong; Justice and Truth their winged child have found.\"\n\nUse of \"masque\" and \"mask\" is discussed by Morton Paley; Shelley used \"mask\" in the manuscript but the first edition uses \"masque\" in the title. The poem has 372 lines, largely in four-line quatrains; two more quatrains appear in some manuscript versions.\n\nShelley begins his poem, written on the occasion of the Peterloo Massacre, Manchester 1819, with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time, \"God, and King, and Law\" – and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action: \"Let a great assembly be, of the fearless, of the free\". The crowd at this gathering is met by armed soldiers, but the protesters do not raise an arm against their assailants:\n\nShelley elaborates on the psychological consequences of violence met with pacifism. The guilty soldiers, he says, will return shamefully to society, where \"blood thus shed will speak / In hot blushes on their cheek\". Women will point out the murderers on the streets, their former friends will shun them, and honourable soldiers will turn away from those responsible for the massacre, \"ashamed of such base company\". A version was taken up by Henry David Thoreau in his essay \"Civil Disobedience\", and later by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in his doctrine of \"Satyagraha\". Gandhi's passive resistance was influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action. It is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's \"The Masque of Anarchy\" to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.\n\nThe poem mentions several members of Lord Liverpool's government by name: the Foreign Secretary, Castlereagh, who appears as a mask worn by Murder, the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth, whose guise is taken by Hypocrisy, and the Lord Chancellor, Lord Eldon, whose ermine gown is worn by Fraud. Led by Anarchy, a skeleton with a crown, they try to take over England, but are slain by a mysterious armoured figure who arises from a mist. The maiden Hope, revived, then calls to the people of England:\n\nPolitical authors and campaigners such as Richard Holmes and Paul Foot, among others, describe it as \"the greatest political poem ever written in English\". In his book \"An Encyclopedia of Pacifism\", Aldous Huxley noted the poem's exhortation to the English to resist assault without fighting back, stating \"The Method of resistance inculcated by Shelley in \"The Mask of Anarchy\" is the method of non-violence\".\n\nAuthor, educator, and activist Howard Zinn refers to the poem in \"A People's History of the United States\". In a subsequent interview, he underscored the power of the poem, suggesting: \"What a remarkable affirmation of the power of people who seem to have no power. Ye are many, they are few. It has always seemed to me that poetry, music, literature, contribute very special power.\" In particular, Zinn uses \"The Mask of Anarchy\" as an example of literature that members of the American labour movement would read to other workers to inform and educate them.\n\nThe rallying language of the poem had led to elements of it being used by political movements. It was recited by students at the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and by protesters in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian revolution of 2011. The phrase \"like lions after slumber, in unvanquishable number\" from the poem is used as a motto/slogan by the International Socialist Organization in their organ. The line \"Ye are many-they are few\" inspired the campaign slogan \"We are many, they are few\" used by protesters during the Poll tax riots of 1989–90 in the United Kingdom, and also inspired the title of the 2014 documentary film \"We Are Many\", which focused on the global 15 February 2003 anti-war protests.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the British Labour Party, quoted the final stanza from the poem at his rally in Islington, on the final day of campaigning for the 2017 general election. Corbyn subsequently quoted the final stanza again during his speech at the Pyramid stage at the 2017 Glastonbury Festival. Academic and writer John Sutherland has suggested that the title of the party's 2017 manifesto, \"For the Many, Not the few\", was derived from the poem. The phrase 'a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few' also appears in the revised version of Clause IV of the Labour Party Constitution. \n\nThe same variation, \"For The Many, Not The Few\", was the sub-title to Robert Reich's 2016 book, \"Saving Capitalism\".\n\nLines from the poem are quoted on the sleeve of The Jam's 1980 album \"Sound Affects\".\n\nLines from the poem inspired and are featured in the John Vanderslice song \"Pale Horse\".\n\nThe poem's lines \"like lions after slumber, In unvanquishable number, Shake your chains to earth, like dew Which in sleep had fallen on you -- Ye are many, the are few\" are quoted by the title and closing lines of the Scritti Politti song \"Lions After Slumber\". They are also referenced in the opening lines of the song \"Blaze\" by Strike Anywhere and quoted as the epigraph and referenced in the title of the autobiography of activist Ella Reeve Bloor, We Are Many.\n\nThe chorus of the song \"Robin Hood\" by The Mekons contains the lines \"Rise like lions, shake your chains, babe. Ye are many, they are few\".\n\nIn the episode of \"Heartbeat\" titled \"The Heart of a Man\", the character played by Jeff Hordley, Stan Keaton, quotes the last verse in its entirety whilst standing outside the Aidensfield Arms with his fellow sacked workers.\n\n\n"}

One reason for its establishment is to counter the growing influence and activism of militant and Islamic extremism in Indonesia. The \"official\" description of JIL is \"\"a community which is studying and bringing forth a discourse on Islamic vision that is tolerant, open and supportive for the strengthening of Indonesian democratization.\"\"\n\nIt was started from several meetings and discussions among young Muslim intellectuals in ISAI (\"Institut Studi Arus Informasi\"; Institute for the Studies on Free Flow of Information), Jakarta, and then extended through discussion using a mailing list, islamliberal@yahoogroups.com in early 2001. The founders held the first discussion on February 21, 2001, at \"Teater Utan Kayu\", Jakarta, on \"Akar-Akar Liberalisme Islam: Pengalaman Timur Tengah\" (\"The Roots of Islamic Liberalism: The Middle East Experience\"), presented by a young progressive scholar, Luthfi Assyaukanie. That meeting was followed by other discussions, either in the form of face-to-face meetings or through the mailing list.\n\nSince mid-2001, the \"official\" name of Jaringan Islam Liberal has been used on their website , which displays their activities, articles, discussions, and relevant sources for the dissemination of liberal Islam. Their place of meeting and secretariat is at Teater Utan Kayu, Jakarta, a complex owned by Goenawan Mohamad, a leading journalist and author, and used for arts performances and by non-governmental organizations. By now, the network is led by liberal young thinker, Ulil Abshar Abdalla, who is also the director of ICRP - Indonesian Conference on Religion and Peace.\n\nJIL interpretation of Islam is based on the principles follows:\n\n\nFor the proponents of JIL, using liberal Islam in the name of their forum is intended to make a clear point. Liberal Islam represents an Islam that emphasizes individual freedom in accordance with the Mu'tazila doctrine of human freedom and liberation of socio-political structure from oppressive and undemocratic domination. The adjective \"liberal\" for the activists in JIL has two meanings: \"being liberal\" and \"liberating.\" Islam has always many different interpretations, so liberal Islam is another variant of Islam and an alternative to literal Islam, Islamic fundamentalism, Islamic extremism, and many others.\n\nSince its inception, JIL has conducted many regular activities concerning public education. With the assistance from funding agencies such as The Asia Foundation, JIL is able to voice liberal, tolerant aspirations and interpretations of Islam in Indonesia. Activities and programs of JIL include:\n\n\nSome figures who support or follow liberalism are Ulil Abshar Abdalla, Nong Darol Mahmada, Burhanuddin, Hamid Basyaib, Taufiq Adnan Amal, Saiful Mujani, and Luthfi Assyaukanie.\n\nUlil in his book \"\"Becoming Liberal Islam\"\" rejects the types of religious interpretation that are not pluralist, or against democracy which he said potentially undermines Islamic thinking. Ulil Abshar candidly criticizes the MUI has monopolized the interpretation of Islam in Indonesia. MUI fatwas stating that Pluralism, Liberalism, and Secularism are misguided ideologies and Ahmadiyah is out of Islam, have kindled Ulil's emotion.\n\nSome Muslims respond to the emergence of liberal Islamic movement in various ways, either with no respond, respond and criticize it intellectually through medias, or with serious response because it has challenged the basic principles of Islam. There are even groups of radicals who justify killing of Ulil and other members of the Liberal Islam Network (JIL), such as Islamic Ulema Forum (\"Forum Ulama Ummat Islam\", FUUI) in Bandung which issued a death fatwa for Ulil Abshar as the chairman of JIL.\n\nAmong other controversies deviating from mainstream Islam are JIL believes al-Qur'an is a text needs to be studied Hermeneutically; exegesis based on classical Tafsir books is no longer needed; polygamy must be banned; dowry in marriage may be paid by either the husband or wife; prescribed period ('Iddah) should be imposed on men too, either because of divorce or death; predetermined period Marriage (Nikah mut‘ah) is legal, inter-religious marriage shall be allowed to men and women equally; portion of inheritance to daughters should be equal (1:1) to portion given to sons; a bastard child is eligible for inheritance if his biological father is known.\n\nIn 2003, Ulil Abshar is sentenced to death by a fatwa issued by several ulama in \"FUUI\" declaring \"Liberal Islam\" has misguided and derailed from the teachings of Islam due to JIL's article which is considered an insult and distort the truth of religion. Habib Rizieq mentions that Liberal Islam is a \"Plagiarist of thinking\", because its ideas simply imitate the ideas of previous orientalists who began the reforms, especially in understanding and assessing Islam.\n\nAccording to Habib Rizieq, The Indonesian's Liberal Islam movement rants excitedly to the application of Hermeneutics in the studies of the Qur'an. In fact, long before JIL resonating the matter, an Assyrian reverend named Alphonse Mingana (1881-1937), who was also a lecturer of Christian Theology at Birmingham University, in his book \"\"Syriac Influence on The Style of The Koran\"\" published in 1927 states: \"It is time to criticize the text of the Qur'an, as we have done to the Aramaic Jewish Torah and Greek Christian bibles.\" Rizieq furthermore says that the JIL is just a group of inferior people with \"intellectual backwardness\" disease, which according to him, has explained its various statements and actions that are often inconsequentially baseless, ignorant and even tend to get lost, like crazy lunatics.\n\nOn May, 26 to July 29, 2005 the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) at its 7th \"Mu'tamar Nasional\" (مؤتمرالوطنية; National Conference) issued eleven non-legally-binding fatwas, where one of them is to forbid pluralism, secularism and liberalism in Indonesia. JIL responded by reasserting its position not to dissolve and stating the fatwas had restricted the freedom of speech in the democratic country. The JIL movement began to fade out with the departure of Ulil Abshar Abdalla to the United States to continue his education, which also dampened the overreactions from its opposing parties. In mid 2005, FPI attacked JIL headquarters due to the fatwa.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2311014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311014", "title": "Intentional programming", "text": "Intentional programming\n\nIn computer programming, Intentional Programming is a programming paradigm developed by Charles Simonyi that encodes in software source code the precise \"intention\" which programmers (or users) have in mind when conceiving their work. By using the appropriate level of abstraction at which the programmer is thinking, creating and maintaining computer programs become easier. By separating the concerns for intentions and how they are being operated upon, the software becomes more modular and allows for more reusable software code.\n\n\"Intentional Programming\" was developed by former Microsoft chief architect Charles Simonyi, who led a team in Microsoft Research, which developed the paradigm and built an integrated development environment (IDE) called IP (for Intentional Programming) that demonstrated the paradigm. Microsoft decided not to productize the Intentional Programming paradigm, as in the early 2000s Microsoft was rolling out C# and .NET to counter Java adoption. Charles Simonyi decided, with approval of Microsoft, to take his idea out from Microsoft and commercialize it himself. He founded the company Intentional Software to pursue this. Microsoft licensed the Intentional Programming patents Simonyi had acquired while at Microsoft, but no source code, to Intentional Software.\n\nAn overview of Intentional Programming as it was developed at Microsoft Research is given in Chapter 11 of the book \"Generative Programming: Methods, Tools, and Applications\".\n\nAs envisioned by Simonyi, developing a new application via the Intentional Programming paradigm proceeds as follows. A programmer builds a WYSIWYG-like environment supporting the schema and notation of business knowledge for a given problem domain (such as productivity applications or life insurance). Users then use this environment to capture their intentions, which are recorded at high level of abstraction. The environment can operate on these intentions and assist the user to create semantically richer documents that can be processed and executed, similar to a spreadsheet. The recorded knowledge is executed by an evaluator or is compiled to generate the final program. Successive changes are done at the WYSIWYG level only. As opposed to word processors, spreadsheets or presentation software, an Intentional environment has more support for structure and semantics of the intentions to be expressed, and can create interactive documents that capture more richly what the user is trying to accomplish. A special case is when the content is program code, and the environment becomes an intelligent IDE.\n\nKey to the benefits of Intentional Programming is that domain code which capture the intentions are not stored in source code text files, but in a tree-based storage (could be binary or XML). Tight integration of the environment with the storage format brings some of the nicer features of database normalization to source code. Redundancy is eliminated by giving each definition a unique identity, and storing the name of variables and operators in exactly one place. This makes it easier to intrinsically distinguish declarations from references, and the environment can show them differently.\n\nWhitespace in a program is also not stored as part of the source code, and each programmer working on a project can choose an indentation display of the source. More radical visualizations include showing statement lists as nested boxes, editing conditional expressions as logic gates, or re-rendering names in Chinese.\n\nThe system uses a normalized language for popular languages like C++ and Java, while letting users of the environment mix and match these with ideas from Eiffel and other languages. Often mentioned in the same context as language-oriented programming via domain-specific languages, and aspect-oriented programming, IP purports to provide some breakthroughs in generative programming. These techniques allow developers to extend the language environment to capture domain-specific constructs without investing in writing a full compiler and editor for any new languages.\n\nA Java program that writes out the numbers from 1 to 10, using a curly bracket syntax, might look like this:\n\nThe code above contains a common construct of most programming languages, the bounded loop, in this case represented by the codice_1 construct. The code, when compiled, linked and run, will loop 10 times, incrementing the value of \"i\" each time after printing it out.\n\nBut this code does not capture the \"intentions\" of the programmer, namely to \"print the numbers 1 to 10\". In this simple case, a programmer asked to maintain the code could likely figure out what it is intended to do, but it is not always so easy. Loops that extend across many lines, or pages, can become very difficult to understand, notably if the original programmer uses unclear labels. Traditionally the only way to indicate the intention of the code was to add source code comments, but often comments are not added, or are unclear, or drift out of sync with the source code they originally described.\n\nIn intentional programming systems the above loop could be represented, at some level, as something as obvious as \"codice_2\". The system would then use the intentions to generate source code, likely something very similar to the code above. The key difference is that the intentional programming systems maintain the semantic level, which the source code lacks, and which can dramatically ease readability in larger programs.\n\nAlthough most languages contain mechanisms for capturing certain kinds of abstraction, IP, like the Lisp family of languages, allows for the addition of entirely new mechanisms. Thus, if a developer started with a language like C, they would be able to extend the language with features such as those in C++ without waiting for the compiler developers to add them. By analogy, many more powerful expression mechanisms could be used by programmers than mere classes and procedures.\n\nIP focuses on the concept of identity. Since most programming languages represent the source code as plain text, objects are defined by names, and their uniqueness has to be inferred by the compiler. For example, the same symbolic name may be used to name different variables, procedures, or even types. In code that spans several pages – or, for globally visible names, multiple files – it can become very difficult to tell what symbol refers to what actual object. If a name is changed, the code where it is used must carefully be examined.\n\nBy contrast, in an IP system, all definitions not only assign symbolic names, but also unique private identifiers to objects. This means that in the IP development environment, every reference to a variable or procedure is not just a name – it is a link to the original entity.\n\nThe major advantage of this is that if an entity is renamed, all of the references to it in the program remain valid (known as referential integrity). This also means that if the same name is used for unique definitions in different namespaces (such as \"codice_3\"), references with the same name but different identity will not be renamed, as sometimes happens with search/replace in current editors. This feature also makes it easy to have multi-language versions of the program; it can have a set of English-language names for all the definitions as well as a set of Japanese-language names which can be swapped in at will.\n\nHaving a unique identity for every defined object in the program also makes it easy to perform automated refactoring tasks, as well as simplifying code check-ins in versioning systems. For example, in many current code collaboration systems (e.g. Git), when two programmers commit changes that conflict (i.e. if one programmer renames a function while another changes one of the lines in that function), the versioning system will think that one programmer created a new function while another modified an old function. In an IP versioning system, it will know that one programmer merely changed a name while another changed the code.\n\nIP systems also offer several levels of detail, allowing the programmer to \"zoom in\" or out. In the example above, the programmer could zoom out to get a level that would say something like:\n\nThus IP systems are self-documenting to a large degree, allowing the programmer to keep a good high-level picture of the program as a whole.\n\nThere are projects that exploit similar ideas to create code with higher level of abstraction. Among them are:\n\n\n"}

Produced by Collins along with Hugh Padgham, it was released as the first single from his number-one album \"...But Seriously\" (1989). As with his song for Genesis, \"Man on the Corner\", the track has as its subject the problem of homelessness; as such, the song was a substantial departure from the dance-pop music of his previous album, \"No Jacket Required\" (1985).\n\nCollins sings the song from a third-person perspective, as he observes a man crossing the street to ignore a homeless woman, and he implores listeners not to turn a blind eye to homelessness because, by drawing a religious allusion, \"it's just another day for you and me in paradise\". Collins also appeals directly to God by singing: \"Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do? Oh Lord, there must be something you can say.\"\n\nThe song was Collins' seventh and final \"Billboard\" Hot 100 No. 1 single, the last No. 1 single of the 1980s and the first No. 1 single of the 1990s. It was also a worldwide success, eventually becoming one of the most successful songs of his solo career. It won Collins and Padgham the Grammy Award for Record of the Year at the 1991 awards ceremony, while it was also nominated for Song of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male and Best Music Video, Short Form. \"Another Day in Paradise\" also won an award for British Single at the 1990 Brit Awards. Despite the awards gained following its release, the song also generated some controversy over its subject matter and has received a largely negative reaction from music critics.\n\nThe live performance of the song at the 1991 Grammy Awards by Collins and David Crosby, who provided backing vocals on the track, was released on the 1994 album \"Grammy's Greatest Moments Volume I\". In 2009, Collins's version was listed at 86th on \"Billboard\"s Greatest Songs of All Time. \"Another Day in Paradise\" has since been covered by several artists, including Brandy, her brother Ray J, Jam Tronik, Axxis, Novecento, and Hank Marvin.\n\nThe song was another massive hit for Collins. On 23 December 1989, it became his seventh () No. 1 single in the U.S. The song was also the final No. 1 song of the 1980s in the U.S., and remained at No. 1 for four weeks, which classifies the song as a hit from the 1990s as well. This song is notable for keeping Janet Jackson's \"Rhythm Nation\" from reaching No. 1. It also saw out the 1980s and saw in the 1990s at the top of the German singles chart. The song had already reached No. 2 in the UK in November of that year. The single version is slightly different from the album version in that it uses a shorter intro.\n\nThe song's music video was directed by Jim Yukich and produced by Paul Flattery of FYI The video, shot entirely in black and white, features Collins singing in a dark background, interspersed with images of the homeless, the immigrants and the poverty of the chidrens in the streets. The music video also features many messages about the homeless, to convey the full message of the song. Collins' part was shot in less than an hour in New York.\n\nMusic historian Colin Larkin wrote that \"Another Day in Paradise\" had been widely criticised. Collins addressed the criticism from the English rock press at the time of its release, who found him unqualified to sing about the poor due to his wealth, by saying: \"When I drive down the street, I see the same things everyone else sees. It's a misconception that if you have a lot of money you're somehow out of touch with reality.\"\n\nSinger-songwriter and political activist Billy Bragg was scathing of the song in an interview in 2000, drawing a contrast between Collins and a band he admired, the Clash, stating: \"Phil Collins might write a song about the homeless, but if he doesn't have the action to go with it he's just exploiting that for a subject.\" In 2003, Andrew Collins described the song as a \"bland redress\" for the subject of homelessness in the \"New Statesman\". Caroline Sullivan of \"The Guardian\" dismissed the track in 2007 as \"a song that addressed the issue of homelessness with the same insight as Sporty Spice's 'If That Were Me'\". Writing for the BBC in 2010, David Sheppard described the song's lyrics as \"cringe-worthy\" and gave it as an example of Collins \"painting the bull's-eye on his own forehead\" when it came to his negative status with music critics.\n\nWriting for MSN in 2013, Hugh Wilson contrasted Collins's concern for the homeless in the song with his concern as a multimillionaire at the prospect of the UK's election of a tax-raising socialist government. Referring to Collins's statement that he would consider leaving the UK with the election of a Labour government, Wilson noted that the song led to \"accusations of hypocrisy\" because Collins had \"bemoaned the plight of the homeless\" in it. Wilson also said Collins became \"an easy target when future elections came round\".\n\n12\" single\n\nCD maxi single\n\n7\" single\n\n3\" CD single\n\nVirgin - VSCD1233 (Martin H)\n\n\nLess than six months after the release of the original Phil Collins version, a cover version by dance act Jam Tronik was released in the UK.

{"id": "2311061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311061", "title": "Adam Frans van der Meulen", "text": "Adam Frans van der Meulen\n\nAdam Frans van der Meulen or Adam-François van der Meulen (11 January 163215 October 1690) was a Flemish painter and draughtsman who was particularly known for his scenes of military campaigns and conquests. Snayers also painted portraits, hunting scenes, paintings of chateaux and landscapes. He created designs for prints and cartoons for tapestries.\n\nHe worked in the service of the French king Louis XIV of France for whom he painted his victories, his new possessions and portraits. He was instrumental in building the propagandistic image of the French king as the 'Sun King'. His battle scenes had an important influence on the development on the genre of military painting in France.\n\nAdam Frans van der Meulen was born in Brussels where he was baptized on 11 January 1632. He was the eldest of the seven children of Pieter van der Meulen and his second wife Maria van Steenwegen. His father was a respected notary. He was registered on 5 March 1651 at the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke as the pupil of Peter Snayers. Snayers was a painter from Antwerp who had moved to Brussels to work for the court. He specialized in pictures of battles, attacks on convoys and civilians and hunting scenes. Van der Meulen became a master of the Guild of Saint Luke in Brussels on 5 March 1651.\nVan der Meulen's earliest works dealt with the same subject matter as those of his master Snayers, in particular cavalry skirmishes. He was also known for depicting courtly retinues mounted on their horses. His reputation for this type of scene as well as his skill in the painting of horses reached France. This led to the artist being called to Paris where he entered into the service of Louis XIV on 1 April 1664. Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the powerful surintendant des Bâtiments, Arts et Manufactures (Superintendent of Buildings, Arts and Manufactures) and later minister of finance, is believed to have been behind the royal appointment of van der Meulen. Colbert had been charged with immortalizing the military successes of Louis XIV. To achieve this propagandistic purpose, he had come up with the idea to create a series of tapestries that would show the heroic deeds of the king.\n\nThe court painter (Premier peintre du roi) Charles Le Brun had been put in charge of the Gobelins Manufactory, the royal tapestry works newly created in 1663, and was officially appointed its director on 8 March 1663. To realize Colbert's project of a series of tapestries on the king's military campaigns, Le Brun sought to surround himself with a team of painters who would be capable of translating his ideas into tapestries and van der Meulen was recruited to assist Le Brun in this project. Van der Meulen's varied skills were particularly appreciated for this purpose. Van der Meulen's reputation as a skilled painter of horses has been cited as one of the reasons why he was solicited to work in France.\nVan der Meulen was involved in the design of multiple tapestry series. He first worked on the series of \"The History of the King\" for which he created the scenes of the military conquests. As the design work involved a lot of work, van der Meulen invited other Flemish artists to assist him with his designs. The landscape artist Adriaen Frans Boudewijns entered in 1666 into a 3-year contract to work in the service of Adam Frans van der Meulen. When van der Meulen worked on the design of 12 Gobelins representing the months for King Louis XIV, van der Meulen executed the smaller figures and part of the landscapes while the remainder of the landscapes was completed by Boudewijns and Abraham Genoels, another Flemish painter active in Paris. While in Paris, Boudewijns also engraved many of van der Meulen's compositions. Boudewijns married the sister of van der Meulen called Barbe or Barbara on 12 January 1670. From 1668 van der Meulen worked on the series of tapestries called the 'Maisons royales' ('Royal Residences') depicting the various palaces of the king.\n\nVan der Meulen's career in France took off rapidly. His annual wages at the Gobelins Manufactory were regularly increased and he was in 1666 one of its best-paid artists. He accompanied Louis XIV during his campaign through Flanders during the War of Devolution. He made drawings of various cities including Turnhout, Kortrijk, Oudenaarde, Aalst and Lille. His paintings representing the campaigns of Flanders in 1667 so delighted the King that from that date van der Meulen was ordered to accompany him on all his expeditions. He accompanied le Grand Condé during his campaign through Bourgogne-Franche-Comté.\nHe obtained in 1669 the royal privilege to have his works engraved. He was appointed \"peintre ordinaire du Roy\" (ordinary painter to the king) in 1673. In the same year he was received into the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) without having to submit a reception piece as was usually the case. He attained the grade of councilor in the Academy in 1681 and that of principal councilor in 1688.\n\nVan der Meulen made a total of nine trips to document King Louis XIV's military campaigns. He enjoyed all kinds of facilities at his job: he had his own coach, took his meals with the officers, and had an assistant called Jean Paul who helped him with the drawings. This assistant artist has remained unidentified and was referred to by van der Meulen as 'mon homme' ('my man') without further specification. Van der Meulen followed in 1673 Louis XIV during the Franco-Dutch War, accompanied by Jean Paul. The two artist made drawings of about 32 cities that were conquered by the French during the campaign. Later he also made drawings of Blois, Amboise and Chambord in France. He further worked in Maastricht in 1674 and in Flanders between April 1676 and 1677. In the wake of further campaigns in Flanders by generals le Grand Condé and Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne he visited along with Le Brun and André Le Nôtre in 1677 Cambrai, Valenciennes, Saint-Omer, Mont Cassel and Cassel.\nIn 1679 he was commissioned to picture the new French territories, which were allocated after the Peace of Nijmegen. During this trip he met the Flemish landscape painter Cornelis Huysmans near Dinant. He tried to convince Huysmans to join him in Paris as a designer at the Gobelins Manufactory but Huysmans declined. Later that year he was in Dinant and in the years 1681 and 1682 he was in Strasbourg where he drew the newly acquired French possessions of Strasbourg and Lorraine.\n\nVan der Meulen had married Catharine Huseweel before he moved to France. The couple had several children. One son, Louis who was born on 20 March 1669 was baptized on 27 March 1669 in the chapel of the Tuileries by the archbishop of Nazianze and coadjutor of Reims and had King Louis XIV as godfather and Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier as godmother. His first wife died in January 1677. On 22 March 1679 he signed a marriage contract with Catherine Lobry, daughter of a captain of the guard of Count Bassigni. She died already on 4 October 1680. He married 20-year-old Marie de Bye, a cousin of Charles Le Brun on 12 January 1681. The couple had many children of whom one was born posthumously.\nHe painted the designs for the decorations of the Ambassadors Staircase, the grand staircase of the King's apartment at Versailles (four trompe l'oeil tapestries representing the taking of various towns, 1677). From 1679 he worked on the large-scale paintings of The King's Conquests (\"Les conquêtes du Roi\") intended for the decoration of the Royal Pavilion of Marly on which he worked until his death in 1690. Marly was a new pleasure residence built for the King as an architectural fantasy, with twelve little pavilions and elegant Royal Pavilion laid out on a square plan. The four apartments of the pavilion were separated by vestibules with as only decoration two marble tables with above them two large paintings of The King's Conquests by van der Meulen. Van der Meulen was commissioned by Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier to create smaller replicas of his paintings of conquests to decorate the Château de Choisy (1680-1688), and then by Louvois to decorate the Château de Meudon.\n\nHe died in Paris in 1690. After his death, seals were affixed to his apartment and studio, as had been the case at the time of Le Brun's death a short time before, since Louis XIV asserted his royal privilege. As van der Meulen was an ordinary painter to the King, and resided at the Manufacture des Gobelins, the sovereign ordered a number of works to be seized, which he thought proper to be returned to him.\nHis pupils and workshop assistants included Saveur Lecomte, Mathieu Dufresnet, Dominicus Nollet, Gérard Jean Baptiste Scotin (II), Nicolas de Largillière, Jan van Huchtenburg, Jean-Baptiste Martin and François Duchatel.\n\nVan der Meulen was one of the foremost battle painters of his time. He is also known for his many topographical drawings, which he made as preparations for his battle pieces. He painted equestrian portraits and painted and drew many animal studies. His works always retained their Flemish character in terms of color, although his style was modified by that of the French school.\n\nThe most important portion of van der Meulen's work is made up of battle scenes. His early works in this genre were close in style to those of his master Pieter Snayers. These early works from the 1650s depicted scenes of fighting horsemen. Like Snayers he frequently represented a village under attack. These works relish in the depiction of the whirling melee of horsemen and horses itself, as if in distant response to Leonardo's Battle of Anghiari.\nAfter moving to France and becoming the official war artist of Louis XIV during the multiple military French campaigns in Europe of the late 17th century, van der Meulen developed a new approach to his depictions of battles. He excluded the horror and morbid rawness of the events. Rather than concentrate on the heat of the action from close up, he used the compositional device of a crowded elevated foreground behind which there is a plunging wide panoramic landscape. The characters whom the artist aims to give the key role in the scene are placed on a mound in the foreground, often mounted on horseback to give them more dignity. On a second plane is typically depicted the supposed movement of the troops and in a third and last plane the profile of the city being attacked. The action is depicted in receding planes accentuated by the folds of the terrain, the alternation of zones of shadow and light and the gradual fading of the light, which marks a view towards a city in the distance. The use of the same compositional scheme gives an impression of unity to many of his paintings as only the profile of the city is different. The uniformity of these compositions can be explained by their use for political purposes. Nevertheless, the paintings of the artist were always praised for their beauty and their use for the decoration of the Royal Pavilion of Marly, for the vestibules as well as for the rooms, shows the fully decorative virtue of his animated and varied landscapes.\nThe features of his style are clearly visible in the large cycle of paintings of \"Les conquêtes du Roi\" made for the Royal Pavilion of Marly. One of the most popular compositions in this series was the one depicting \"The crossing of the Rhine on 12 June 1672\". Many versions of this composition exist, made with different levels of involvement of his workshop (the Louvre, Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen, Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon, Rijksmuseum, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Palace of Versailles, private collections). The event depicted is the crossing of the Rhine by the French troops during the Franco-Dutch War. The crossing did not involve any military engagement with the Dutch troops and solely involved the French troops wading through the Rhine when the water was low. Nevertheless, this event was described in contemporary French propaganda as a feat equal to those of Alexander the Great and Emperor Constantine the Great. Many writers and visual artists eulogized the French king for this exploit. The various depictions misrepresent, however, the actual history of the event. Louis XIV was in fact not present at the crossing of the Rhine as he was at the time staying with his brother Philippe I, Duke of Orléans in the monastery in Elterberg. Van der Meulen's paintings of the crossing of the Rhine, which show Louis XIV in the foreground commanding the action are thus a conscious misrepresentation of history for propaganda purposes. \nIn van der Meulen has placed Louis XIV at the heart of the event, in the immediate vicinity of danger, thus emphasizing the king's courage and power. The king eclipses the other personages: his brother Philippe I, Duke of Orléans and le Grand Condé who had planned the maneuver, are placed behind the sovereign. A similar propagandistic purpose was present in the prints that were made after van der Meulen's designs. The inscriptions underneath the prints made after The King's Conquests were written by Claude-François Ménestrier, a French heraldist and Jesuit who was an attendant of the royal court. These inscriptions invariably highlight the direct involvement of the French king in the glorious events being depicted and thus go beyond a simple description of the events. It is clear that the contemporary perception was that these works were made to preserve the memory of the king's military feats for posterity. The created by Pieter van Schuppen after a painting by Nicolas de Largillière confirms this. Underneath the portrait of the painter appears the following inscription, which does not mention van der Meulen, but rather speaks of the King as a painter: 'C'est de Louis Le Grand le Peintre incomparable, Qui de ses plus beaux faits a peint la verité, Et qui sans le secours des couleurs de la fable, Le Fait Voir ce qu'il est a la Posterité.' ('It is of Louis the Great, the incomparable painter, who has painted the truth with his beautiful deeds and without the aid of the colours of fables, shows what he is to posterity').\n\nThe various versions depict the King in the company of different personages although they are placed in the same place in the composition. It is possible that these variations were made at the behest of the patron for whom a particular version was created. The cycle of paintings made for the Royal Pavilion at Marly were very successful. They led to a fashion for decorating palaces and public buildings with paintings representing military scenes.\n\nThe process in which the large compositions were created has been studied by art historians. It is known that van der Meulen was present at some of the military actions that he depicted. He also visited the locations of the actions afterwards and spent much time making topographical sketches of the landscapes and cities that were depicted in his battle scenes. He often relied on other artists to assist with these sketches. He even used prints by other artists as a basis for his compositions as in the case of his painting of the siege of Utrecht. The views of Utrecht in the painting are very similar to prints of Utrecht by the Dutch painter Herman Saftleven. Van der Meulen integrated these views and profiles into his vast compositions. They were also used for the design of tapestries as well as for prints. Research has shown that a number of prints depicting Louis XIV's conquests were made before the paintings depicting the same scenes were made. In other words, some of the prints were the basis for the later paintings rather than the other way around.\n\nVan der Meulen also painted several studies of horses. His studies of horses constituted a directory that the painter could use in his compositions as well as serve as models for his apprentices. The Dutch engraver Jan van Huchtenburg engraved a series of his sketches of horses killed in combat. Van der Meulen enjoyed a reputation for his skill at painting horses.\nVan der Meulen was granted a royal patent to have his original designs engraved and published. He put together a team of painters-printmakers to engrave his designs. Many of these printmakers came from Flanders and the Dutch Republic such as Adriaen Frans Boudewijns, Abraham Genoels, Jan van Huchtenburg and Romeyn de Hooghe. The French engraver Robert Bonnart trained with van der Meulen and sold prints on his behalf. Van der Meulen arranged for many of his drawings and paintings representing landscapes and scenes of the military life to be engraved. These were intended for a clientele of private clients. He and later his widow sold the prints from their lodgings at the Gobelin Manufacture. Later he hired publishers and merchants to distribute his prints. He arranged in 1670 for 13 large-scale plates representing sieges, the taking of towns and royal castles to be executed for the King's Cabinet. These were acquired by the Crown, which used them to make prints that were published by the Royal Printing Office for collectors in 1679. The painter succeeded in selling to the king in 1685 prints taken from new plates, and then arranged for the sale to the public of a second edition of prints which represented the series of The King's Conquests he had made for Marly.\n"}

After the father's early death in 1881, Bigiev's mother, Fatima Hanim Bigiyeva, provided for the education of him and his elder brother Muhammad Zahir Bigiev.\nBigiev spent most of his youth studying at madrasas in Kazan, Bukhara, Samarkand, Mecca, Medina, Cairo (where he attended the Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah and was educated by Shayk Muhammad Bakhit al-Muti'i), Damascus, Istanbul and Uttar Pradesh in India, where he studied Sanskrit and the Mahabharata. While he attended many famous universities, he preferred studying on his own while benefitting from the mentorship of different scholars.\n\nIn 1904, he returned to Russia, where he married Asma Aliye Khanim, daughter of a merchant and madrasah teacher from Chistopol. Afterwards, he moved to St. Petersburg and attended lectures at the Law faculty of St. Petersburg Imperial University as an auditor, in order to be able to compare Islamic and Western legal systems. He also became good friends with Abdurreshid Ibrahim, the editor of the newspaper \"Ülfät\", in which he published several times.\n\nDuring the Revolution of 1905, Bigiev became actively involved in the founding of the Muslim political organization, and later party, Ittifaq al-Muslimin, starting with the first Congress of the Muslims of Russia, which was held in Nizhny Novgorod in August. He also participated in the second and third congresses of 1905 and 1906, where he was elected as a member of the central committee of the parliamentary group in the Duma. Bigiev was responsible for providing the protocols of the Ittifaq meetings.\n\nAfter the end of the Revolution, he also worked in publishing (in 1908 editing and publishing his deceased brother's book \"A trip to Mesopotamia\") and from 1910 onwards as a teacher at the Husayniya madrasah in Orenburg. He also held lectures at the city's philanthropic association (\"Orenburg Jäm'iyät-i Khayriyäsi\") and became secretary of the fourth Muslim congress in 1914. In 1915, he published \"Islahat Asaslare\" (\"The Fundamentals of Reform\"), a catalogue of social and political change among the Muslims of Russia between 1904 and 1915.\n\nAfter his publications in Rizaeddin bin Fakhreddins newspaper \"Shura\" drew immense criticism from the local Ulama, he left Orenburg.\n\nBigiev welcomed the February Revolution, claiming that \"slavery is gone, and will never come back\". Even after the takeover by the Soviets, he saw the new regime as a potential ally against what he perceived to be the primary enemy of the Muslims of the world – the British Empire. During the course of the Russian Civil War, Bigiev toured the Volga region together with Abdul Hafiz Mohamed Barakatullah in order to mobilize the Muslim population for military service against the British. He also held close contact with other anti-British Indian activists and arranged for them to live in the Soviet Union.\nIn 1920, Bigiev could be found in Ufa, where he presented a program for social reform with the title of \"Appeal to the Islamic Nations\" to the members of the Muslim religious administration; this included the allegiance of the Russian Muslims to the caliphate above the Soviet State. The program formed the basis for his book \"Islam Milletlerine\" (\"To Muslim Nations\"; or \"Islamning Elifbasi\", \"The Alphabet of Islam\", as response to Nikolai Bukharins \"Alphabet of Communism\") of which 5,000 copies were printed in Berlin in 1923. Following this publication, he was arrested in Moscow while on his way from Petrograd to a conference in India. The Soviets had begun to suppress all forms of religious expression, including \"Pan-Turkists\" and \"Pan-Islamists\".\n\nHis arrest provoked a storm of indignation; for example, the Tatars of Finland requested the assistance of the Turkish government, which at that time was on friendly terms with the new Soviet regime. The leading newspapers of Istanbul and Ankara published telegrams with pleas to set Bigiev free again. The campaign finally succeeded; Bigiev was freed on the condition that he was to live in Moscow under state surveillance for two years.\n\nSeveral years later, in May 1926, Bigiev was included in delegations of Soviet Muslims to the Pan-Islamic Congresses in Mecca and Cairo. On the return trip, he attended several sessions of the Turkish parliament and met the Turkish prime minister İsmet İnönü. After his return, he was also elected by the Leningrad Tatars to become their delegate at a congress of Muslim clergy in Ufa.\n\nHe returned to Leningrad again in 1927. The political climate had worsened harshly; Bigiev witnessed the League of Militant Atheists and was personally forbidden to leave the country. He was also out of work; he continuously applied to the scholar Ignaty Krachkovsky as a teacher of Arabic, Persian and Turkic languages at Leningrad University, and in 1929 even applied to the government of Afghanistan for a job. His wife and four of his children were temporarily arrested. In 1930, after he, his family and other clergymen where deprived of food coupons, he finally decided to secretly leave the country.\n\nHe first crossed the border into Chinese Turkestan, where he tried to settle down in Kashgar; however, the Chinese government prohibited him from doing so. He then travelled on horseback to Afghanistan, where its ruler Nadir Shah provided him with an international passport. This allowed him to go to India, where he met some of his friends he had made in earlier years.\n\nHowever, he did not stay in India for long, instead starting a period of worldwide travelling. In 1931, he held a speech at the World Islamic Congress in Jerusalem, where he praised Finland for its friendly attitude towards Muslim émigrés from Russia. He also visited Ankara, Berlin (where he founded an Islamic publishing house), Finland and Iran and Iraq, where he studied Shia Islam. He resumed his tour in 1937, again visiting India, more specifically Bombay and Benares. He was then invited by Abdurreshid Ibrahim to Japan; the two travelled together to China, Java, Sumatra and Singapore.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Bigiev tried to reach Afghanistan again, but was arrested by British authorities in Peshawar without any charge. The ruler of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan, petitioned for his release, but Bigiev was kept under house arrest until 1945. In these years, he wrote ten of his major works.\n\nAfter his release, Bigiev suffered from illness which forced him to undergo several surgeries. In 1948, he travelled to Turkey and from there to Cairo, where he died on 28. October 1949. He was buried at the Royal Cemetery of the Khedives of Egypt.\n\nWhile Bigiev left \"a deep imprint on the history of the reformed madrasas and the Muslim press of Russia in the 1910s\",\nhis work and even his name are largely forgotten today. This can mostly be attributed to the Soviet Union under Stalin, where his name was purged from documents and bibliographies and the study of his works forbidden.\n\nHe was officially rehabilitated by the High Court of the Russian Federation in February 1997. Still, only a small amount of research on his life and work has taken place and the amount of literature available in English is very limited.\n\nHowever, a movement towards rediscovery seems to be taking place; one of Kazans streets is now named after Bigiev. In 2007, as a part of the project \"Ijma' – Concord\", the Kunstkamera (Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography) of the Russian Academy of Sciences sponsored the documentary \"The manuscript and the Fate\" about Bigievs life, with a script written by the Orientalist Jefim A. Rezvan. A year later, in 2008, the documentary \"And the moon has split\", directed by B. Baishev, was awarded a special price \"for the contribution to Islamic Enlightenment\" at the fourth Golden Minbar International Film Festival.\n\nBigievs Quran translation was reprinted in 2010 from copies saved by descendants. For the 140th anniversary of his birth, a number of activities were held in the Penza Oblast of Russia; on June 23, a plaque was dedicated in the city of Kikino, one of Bigievs supposed birth places, and a maktab and a garden near the mosque of the town were renamed in Bigievs honor.\n\nBigievs wife Asma died in Ufa in 1979; of their eight children, two died young.\n\nHis son-in-law Abdurahman Tagirovich Tagirdzhanov became a professor of Orientalism at Leningrad State University\n, while his cousin Abrashit Museevich Bigiev (1917–2010) became professor for Metallurgy at Magnitogorsk State Technical University.\n\nToday, descendants of Bigiev live in Russia (in Ufa, Moscow and St. Petersburg) and in Ukraine (Dnepropetrovsk).\n\nWhile he was one of the leading members of Jadidism, Bigievs provocative nature led to opposition not only from the Kadimists (nearly all issues of the Qadimist journal \"Din vä Ma'ishät\" include one or more articles written directly against him), but also from fellow reformers.\n\nIn his 97-page essay \"Rahmet-i Ilahiye Burhanlari\" (\"The storms of God's clemency\"), published in Orenburg in 1910, Bigiev argued that God would also include unbelievers in his mercy and forgiveness. This elicited criticism from many Ulama, including Ismail Gaspirali.\n\nThe influence of Bigiev was felt beyond the Russian Empire, for example in Istanbul, where the scholar Mustafa Sabri Efendi criticized Bigiev for his \"dangerous and heretical\" (\"küfriyati muhtevi\") ideas and was responsible for the ban of three of his works in the Ottoman Empire. However, Sabri defended Bigievs qualification to discuss theological matters. Sabri coined the epithet \"Luther of Islam\" for Bigiev.\n\nBigiev has also been described as one of \"the most notorious Sunnite polemicists against Shiism in the 20th century\", along with such figures as Muhibb-ud-Deen Al-Khatib and Ehsan Elahi Zaheer. This is the result of him penning several well-known anti-Shia books, including \"Al-Washi'ah fi naqd 'aqa'id al-shi'ah\". In these works, Bigiev notes that during his travels in Iraq and Iran he had not met even one Shia individual who knew the Quran to a satisfactory level.\n\nBigiev wrote extensively; for example, he published 64 books and more than 120 essays and articles on theology. Included here are some of his most notable works.\n\n\n"}

In 2009, Andrus earned the Texas Rangers starting shortstop job at the age of 20. He is a two-time All Star.\n\nAndrus was born in Maracay, Venezuela, the son of Emilio and Elvia Andrus. Emilio Andrus was a university professor; he died when Elvis was seven years old. He has two older brothers, Erold and Erikson. Some Venezuelan families name their children after famous non-Venezuelan people, but Andrus said that he is not sure whether he was named after Elvis Presley. Andrus said, \"I asked my mother a lot of times, but she never told me. Maybe my dad liked Elvis Presley. I’m not sure about that.\"\n\nAt the age of 16, Andrus was signed by the Atlanta Braves and received a signing bonus of more than $500,000. He started the 2005 season with the Orlando Braves of the Gulf Coast League, and was promoted to Danville late in the season. He spent 2006 with Class-A Rome, being named to the South Atlantic League All-Star team.\n\nIn 2007, Andrus joined the Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Carolina League. During the season, he was selected to the All-Star Futures Game and was selected again for the showcase in 2008.\n\nOn July 31, 2007, Andrus, Jarrod Saltalamacchia and three minor league pitchers (Matt Harrison, Neftalí Feliz and Beau Jones) were traded from the Braves to the Rangers for Mark Teixeira and Ron Mahay.\n\nWith Rangers shortstop Michael Young agreeing to move to third base in 2009, Andrus earned the starting job on Opening Day. He was the second-youngest player in the American League at the time. As Andrus was only 20 years old, Texas signed veteran shortstop Omar Vizquel for insurance.\n\nAndrus stole his 20th base on July 28, 2009, in his rookie season. Andrus was the 10th player in major league history to steal 20 bases under the age of 21. The last player to do that was then-teammate Andruw Jones in 1997 with the Atlanta Braves. Andrus was named to the 2010 American League All-Star team as a reserve shortstop.\n\nIn 2010, he batted .265, without any home runs. He led the AL in sacrifice hits (17), was 2nd in caught stealing (15), and 9th in stolen bases (32).\n\nIn 2011, Andrus batted .279, with 5 home runs. He was 3rd in the American League in sacrifice hits (16), 4th in caught stealing (12), and 5th in stolen bases (37). On defense, he led all AL shortstops in errors, with 25, and was 2nd among league shortstops in putouts (245) and 3rd in assists (407). In 2012, Andrus earned his second All-Star selection, batting .286 while leading the American League in sacrifice hits with 17.\n\nBefore Opening Day of 2013, Andrus signed an eight-year, $120 million extension. On September 14, he stole his 40th stolen base of the season against the Oakland Athletics, stealing second base off of Bartolo Colón. Andrus later surpassed Ian Kinsler for the Texas Rangers all-time leader in stolen bases with 175. He finished the year again leading the American League in sacrifice hits (16) while batting .271 and scoring 91 runs.\nAndrus began the 2014 season with an 11-game hitting streak that ultimately ended with an early ejection April 13. On June 8, Andrus had a 39-game hitting streak against the Cleveland Indians snapped as he went 0 for 4. That game marked the first time in his career where he did not get a hit against the Indians. Only Vladimir Guerrero had a longer streak against a team with (44, against Texas). Andrus stole his 180th career stolen base against the Seattle Mariners but led the American League in caught stealing with 15, batting .263 for the season.\n\nAndrus finished 2015 with career lows in batting average (.258), OBP (.309), and sacrifice hits, while posting a career-best seven home runs and stealing 25 bags for the AL West champion Rangers. On defense, he led the major leagues in assists, with 516. He batted .182 in the Rangers' ALDS series against Toronto and made two of the team's three errors in the pivotal seventh inning of Game 5, won by the Blue Jays. In 2016, hit .302 with eight home runs and 69 RBIs. \n\nHe continued the following season, in 2017, to post a career offensive season, hitting .297 with 20 home runs and 88 RBIs and 25 steals in 158 games. On defense, he led the major leagues in assists, with 490.\n\nOn April 11, 2018, Andrus was hit by a pitch on his right arm and left the game. X-rays and CT scans tested positive that Andrus had suffered a fractured right elbow. As a result, he was placed on the disabled list for the first time of his Major League career. No surgery was required, but to keep out of baseball activity for 6-8 weeks. He was activated on June 18 from the disabled list. Andrus finished 2018 hitting .256/.308/.367/.675 with 6 home runs and 33 RBI.\n\nAndrus hit .275/.313/.393/.707 with 12 home runs, 72 RBIs, and 31 stolen bases in 2019. He tied for the AL lead with 10 sacrifice flies.\n\nAndrus is a Christian. In 2012, Andrus donated $12,500 to OurCalling, a Christian charity that helps homeless people in Dallas County.\n\nAndrus married girlfriend Cori Febles in a ceremony at his home on June 1, 2017. The couple welcomed their first child, Elvis Emilio, on July 6, 2017. On November 28, 2018 they welcomed their second child, a girl, named Lucia Alessandra. For the 2019 season, Andrus adopted \"Baby Shark\" as his walk-up song because it reminded him of his children. \n\nTwo of Andrus' brothers remain in Venezuela. Andrus voiced concern about his home country during civil unrest in early 2014. \"As a human being, you always get angry when you see what's happening with the military back home doing stuff to the civils, and to the students, and that's what really gets me angry. I'm not a political guy, but I just hate when you see somebody just walking and trying to say something get hit by police, or get hit by any military from the country that's supposed to defend the country instead of shoot him or hit him\", he said.\n\nAndrus' older brother Erold Andrus played in the independent leagues in 2009 and 2010 as an outfielder. He has played in the organizations of several MLB teams. During spring training of 2011, though Erold was in minor league camp, he got the opportunity to play in a Rangers spring training game, the first time that Erold and Elvis played together in the United States.\n\nOn July 26, 2019, Andrus became a naturalized US citizen.\n\n"}
{"id": "2311129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311129", "title": "André Beaufre", "text": "André Beaufre\n\nAndré Beaufre (25 January 1902 – 13 February 1975) was a French Army officer and military strategist who attained the rank of Général d'Armée (Army General) before his retirement in 1961.\n\nHe was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine and entered the military academy at École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1921, where he met the future French president Charles de Gaulle, who was an instructor. In 1925 he saw action in Morocco against the Rif, who opposed French rule. Beaufre then studied at the École Supérieure de Guerre and at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques and was subsequently assigned to the French army's general staff.\n\nBy the end of World War II, he had attained the rank of colonel and was well known in the English-speaking world as a military strategist and as an exponent of an independent French nuclear force. He commanded the French forces in the 1956 Suez War campaign against Egypt in 1956. Beaufre later became chief of the general staff of the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers in Europe in 1958. He was serving as chief French representative to the permanent group of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in Washington in 1960 when he was promoted to général d'armée. Beaufre retired from the Army in 1961 for health reasons. He died in 1975 while engaged in a series of lectures in Yugoslavia.\n\nWhile serving as permanent secretary of national defence in Algeria in 1940–41 during World War II, he was arrested by the French Vichy regime, and after his release in 1942 he served in the Free French Army on several fronts until the end of the war in 1945.\n\nIn his book \"1940: The Fall of France\", Beaufre writes: \"The collapse of the French Army is the most important event of the 20th century\". He states that had the French Army held, the Hitler regime would have almost certainly fallen. There would have been no Nazi conquest of Western Europe, no Nazi assault on the Soviet Union, no Holocaust, most likely no Communist takeover of Eastern Europe. He later gave his views on France's fall during interviews for the now famous production by Thames Television, \"The World at War\".\n\nFrench Indochina, 1952, General Beaufre was the leader of the group for NATO tactical studies. He was considering a structure of small buried defensive positions for protection against nuclear strike – they were called the shield (‘bouclier’). In order to intervene in the vast vacant spaces he was suggesting using very light and mobile troops equipped with nuclear cannons. His thesis was taking place in a very uncertain world where both parties were potentially thinking about using nuclear weapons.\n\nBeaufre was a general in the Algerian War. He was leading the Iron Division (\"la division de fer\"). Freshly coming from Indochina and poorly informed about the popular and national character of this new conflict, the troops had been struck hard by Krim Belkacem’s partisans. He argued in his book \"Introduction to Strategy\" for the dissolution of the boundaries between military and civil society; a military approach that acknowledged the existence of an extended battlefield. In Beaufre's theory, the battlefield must be extended to encompass all aspects of a civil society, particularly social and ideological spheres, such as the radio and the classroom. According to Beaufre, the proper concern of the military should be extended to co-ordinating all aspects of a civil society.\n\nGeneral André Beaufre is the originator of the term \"Total Strategy\". A multi-component strategy developed by the security establishment, drawing upon the experience of other countries in counter-revolutionary warfare and low-intensity conflict, and refining and adding to such techniques within the South African context.\nAs a theorist, he features prominently in the more intellectual of the SADF training courses. According to Philip Frankel (an internationally renowned expert in civil-military studies), who has conducted the most comprehensive study of the development of the SADF's \"Total Strategy\", virtually every course at the Joint Defence College is based on one or other of Beaufre strategic works. This concept also found its way into the management of water resources flowing in rivers that cross international political borders, specifically in South Africa.\n\nDuring the early 1960s Beaufre came to prominence as a theoretical military strategist and as an advocate of the independent French nuclear force, which was a major priority of President Charles de Gaulle. Beaufre remained on good terms with the U.S. authorities who opposed Nuclear proliferation but argued that French nuclear independence would give the West greater unpredictability vis-à-vis the Soviet Union and thus strengthen the deterrent capacity of the NATO alliance.\n\nAt the same time Beaufre published \"An Introduction to Strategy\" and later \"Deterrence and Strategy\". His insight greatly influenced deterrence-theory analysis within international-relations circles. Military historians characterized \"An Introduction to Strategy\" as the most complete strategy treatise published in that generation. The Vatican analyzed the papers extensively at the fourth session of Vatican Council II in 1966 and later commented on them in the \"Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World.\"\n\nBeaufre defined nuclear deterrence as the only kind of deterrence that produces the effect seeks to avoid or to end war.\n\nBeaufre developed \"Deterrence and Strategy\" in the context of the bipolar world of the Cold War where the threat of nuclear war was effective. The existence of this threat caused a psychological result and prevented adversaries from taking up arms. Adversaries had to measure the risk they were running if they unleashed a crisis, because the response would have produced political, economic, social, and moral damage from which recovery wouldn't have been easy; material damage and psychological factors played a decisive role in deterrence.\n\nBeaufre believed that military action should be avoided in a nuclear scenario and that victory should be won by paralyzing the adversary through indirect action. It is not simply a matter of terrifying the enemy; it is also a matter of hiding one's own fear by executing those actions that show the opposite. This equilibrium-through-terror axiom ruled during the Cold War and prevented a nuclear confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nFor Beaufre, deterrence was above all the threat of nuclear war. The atomic threat guaranteed peace better than conventional arms did. Of course Beaufre saw the problem principally from the French strategic viewpoint. He was not convinced by conventional deterrence: \"The classical arms race creates instability, just as the nuclear race creates stability.\"\n\nBeaufre's thesis, that the threat of using atomic weapons is the only means for worldwide stabilization, is pessimistic. His pessimism lies in the contradictions between nuclear and conventional deterrence. When one party develops greater offensive capability than another, instability results.\n\nVictory in a conventional war is unilateral; in a nuclear war, destruction is bilateral. The simple expectation of success by one party can unleash aggression in his adversary. Beaufre develops this idea in more detail in a theory called \"the dialectic of the expectations of victory.\"\n\nBeaufre's thought is not restricted to a defence of nuclear deterrence. Elsewhere in his treatise he reflects on the possibility of combining nuclear deterrence with conventional deterrence. He summarizes his concept in this manner: \"The nuclear and classical levels tied to each other, essentially with classic atomic weapons, brings to the latter the stability it lacks and returns to the former the elemental risk of instability that it needs in order to continue its role as the great stabilizer.\"\n\nBeaufre is saying that nuclear and conventional deterrence are \"Siamese twins\" because the instability the conventional mode provokes makes nuclear deterrence necessary, precisely in order to obtain stability. In sum, true deterrence is obtained only through nuclear deterrence. The Cold War proved this, and history provides not even one example of successful conventional deterrence.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In a best-effort network, all users obtain best-effort service, meaning that they obtain unspecified variable bit rate and latency and packet loss, depending on the current traffic load. This can be contrasted with reliable delivery, which can be built on top of best-effort delivery (possibly without latency and throughput guarantees), or with circuit switching schemes which maintain a defined, continuous quality of service.\n\nThe postal service delivers letters using a best-effort delivery approach. The delivery of a certain letter is not scheduled in advance – no resources are preallocated in the post office. The service will make their \"best effort\" to try to deliver a message, but the delivery may be delayed if too many letters suddenly arrive at a postal office. The sender is not informed if a letter has been delivered successfully.\n\nConventional telephone networks are not based on best-effort communication, but on circuit switching. During the connection phase of a new call, resources are reserved in the telephone exchanges, or a busy signal informs the user that the call is blocked due to lack of free capacity. An ongoing phone call can never be interrupted due to overloading of the network, and is guaranteed constant bandwidth.\n\nThe Internet protocol offers a best-effort service of delivering datagrams between hosts. IPv4 is a connectionless internet protocol that depends on the best-effort delivery approach. IPv4 datagrams may be lost, arbitrarily delayed, corrupted, or duplicated. The applications built on top of it implement the additional services they require on an end-to-end basis. Transmission control protocol (TCP) provides a guaranteed delivery of an octet stream between a pair of hosts to the above layer, internally splitting the stream into packets and resending these when lost or corrupted. User datagram protocol (UDP) provides a thinner abstraction layer which only error-checks the datagrams. Both are transport-layer protocols and provide multiplexing between processes on the same host implemented with port numbers.\n\n"}

He is the grandson of Abdulhak Molla, a poet and physician at the court of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. His father was Hayrullah Efendi, a famous historian and ambassador. His mother, Münteha Hanım, was a Circassian. Abdulhak Hamit, while attending the secondary school, had taken private lessons from Yanyalı Tahsin Hoca and Edremitli Bahaddin Hoca. By August 1863, he went to Paris, France with his brother Nasuhi, the workplace of his father. He continued his education there for one and half years. After he returned to Istanbul, he enrolled a French education school and worked in a translation office to advance his French. One year later, he followed his father, who was appointed to the Ottoman Embassy in Tehran, Iran. He studied Persian language for more than one year as well as Arabic and Persian poetry. Following his father's death in 1867, he returned to Istanbul and entered governmental services.\n\nAfter he came in contact with prominent literary personalities, Abdulhak Hamit wrote his first prose \"Macera-yı Aşk\" (Love Affair) depicting his memoirs in Tehran. In 1871, he married Fatma.\n\nEntered the service of foreign affairs, he was appointed 1876 to the Ottoman Embassy in Paris, where he had to opportunity to learn the French literature.\n\nIn 1878, his first brush with controversy occurred on the publishing of his play \"Nesteren\" in Paris. It depicted a rebellion against a tyrannical ruler, and the actual ruler of Turkey at that time, Sultan Abdul Hamid II was so upset by it that he had the playwright fired from his government job.\n\nHe was appointed in 1881 to Poti, Georgia, in 1882 to Volos, Greece and in 1883 to Bombay, India. Due to illness of his wife, the family left India in 1885. On their way to Istanbul, his wife Fatma died in Beirut, then in the Ottoman Empire. She was buried there that inspired him to write his poem \"Makber\" (The Grave), which later became very popular.\n\nBecause of his work \"\"Zeynep\"\", he was suspended of service at the Embassy in London and forced to return home. Only after his promise not to write any more, he was allowed to return his post in London. He made his second marriage with a British woman Nelly.

In 1906, he was sent to the Embassy in Brussels, Belgium.\n\nIn 1908, he became a member of the Turkish Senate. He lost his wife Nelly in 1911, and made later his third marriage with the Belgian Lucienne.\n\nAbdulhak Hamit had to return to Turkey after his deposing by the cabinet during the Balkan Wars. He spent a short time in Vienna, Austria after World War I and returned home with the proclamation of the Turkish Republic in 1923.

The loss of his wife was a key point in his life as he wrote and dedicated many pieces involving her, such as \"Makber\". He leaves behind a legacy of western influences on the evolving Turkish literature scene and was considered one of the greatest Turkish romantics.\n\n\n\nİnci Enginün translated his plays into modern Turkish, published in seven volumes (1998–2002).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2311165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311165", "title": "Ball badminton", "text": "Ball badminton\n\nBall badminton is a sport native to India. It is a\nracket game, played with a yellow ball made of wool, on a court of fixed dimensions (12 by 24 metres) divided by a net. The game was played as early as 1856 by the royal family in Tanjore, the capital of Thanjavur district in Tamil Nadu, India. It enjoys the greatest popularity in India. Ball badminton is a fast-paced game; it demands skill, quick reflexes, good judgment, agility, and the ability to control the ball with one's wrist.\n\nGames are usually played outdoors during the day. As a result, weather conditions wield a considerable influence, and ball badminton's rules allow the effects of weather conditions to be distributed more-or-less evenly between both teams. More recently, indoor versions of the game have been played under artificial lighting. All-India tournaments are conducted regularly using floodlights in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. Ball Badminton sport is managed by \"Ball Badminton Federation of India\". Ball badminton is now an officially recognised game in India. Total 34 units are affiliated to \"Ball badminton federation of India \" in which 26 are States units including Bihar, jharkhand, Nagaland etc. 5 Public sector units and 3 provisional affiliated units.\n\nBall badminton originated in Tanjore, in Tamil Nadu. It became popular, commanding the interest of the Maharaja of Tanjore. The game has attracted many players from southern India.\n\nPreviously, ball badminton was an attractive game for rural boys since it required a minimum of equipment. The game drew a large number of students from South India, resulting in the formation of the Ball Badminton Federation of India in 1954. The BBF was among the first three sports federations—along with the Indian Athletic Federation and the Indian Hockey Federation—to form the Indian Olympic Association in 1961. Ball badminton eventually spread to Andhra Pradesh, and the first national championship was conducted at Hyderabad in 1956. It was later introduced at the junior and sub-junior levels.\n\nTypes of incumbent\nThe ball is yellow wool, from 27 to 30 grams in weight and from 5 to 5.5 cm in diameter. A standard ball-badminton racket usually weighs from 165 to 185 grams and is 63 to 70 cm in length. \nThe strung oval area of the racket should be 20 to 22 across and 24 to 27 cm in length. \nThe net is made of fine cord to make a 2 cm square mesh along its length and is edged with red tape at the top. \nThe entire net is red, white and blue, 100 cm wide and 13.5 metres in length. It is tied to a centre pole of 183 cm and two poles of 185 cm at the sides of the court to maintain the 183 cm height of the net at the centre. \nTwo posts, each 180 cm high, are fixed one metre outside the court on either side at the end of the line to which the net is tied, strong enough to keep the net well stretched. A hook is fixed at 1.5 metres height to each pole to easily tighten the net whenever necessary.\nThe size of the court for \"fives\" teams is 12 metres wide and 24 metres long. It is divided across the middle by a net line over which the net is hung, the ends of which are attached to the tops of the two posts. The serving crease lines are drawn one metre away from each side of the net line and parallel to it. \nThe centre line is drawn halfway between the serving crease lines and parallel to the sidelines; this divides the space on each side of the crease line into two-halves, known as the right and left courts. \nThe boundary lines are marked with white tape, 10 mm thick. The centre and crease lines are to be marked so as to be visible, about 10 mm wide\n\nBall badminton is a team sport. The ball is served (hit from the right or left court of one side to the diagonally opposite court of the other side). The server begins on the right court and moves to the left court each time a point is scored. The ball may be returned by any opposing player. \nAfter the first 9th, 18th, and 27th point the teams change positions, with the server continuing to alternate between the right and left courts. \nThe ball is served underhand below the waist, then it must go over the net and beyond the serving crease line on the other side. An overhand service—if the ball is above the server's waist when it is struck—is a fault. The ball must be returned before it touches the ground, and no player may strike the ball twice in succession. \nThe server must not serve until the other side is ready; ordinarily, the players of the receiving side are expected to be ready. During the game the player must not leave the court except in the act of playing, if he has an accident, or with the referee's permission for activities such as changing a racket, tying a shoelace, or tightening a belt. The referee normally grants a player's request for such activities, unless the ball is in play; however, he has the final right to refuse if he deems such activities delaying tactics. \nIn \"fives\" tournaments, a team consists of ten formally designated players, any five of whom play while the other five remain on the sidelines with the team manager, ready to play. Doubles tournaments use teams of three players. During a match of two or three games, three player substitutions are allowed. Substitutions may be made at any time during the game. The ball may not be changed during a three-game match set, unless it is damaged.\n\nIf a fault is made by the serving team, the serving player shall be replaced by a teammate. If all five players on a team commit a serving fault, the serve goes to the receiving team. If a fault is made by the receiving team, the serving team is awarded a point and continues to serve.\nIt is a fault if:\n\nA match consists of three games. The team that wins two out of three games is the match winner. The team first scoring the 34th point wins a game. \nTeams start each game from the side opposite the one they played the previous game. There is a break of two minutes between the end of the first game and the start of the second game, and five minutes between the second and the third games. \nChoice of side and the right of first service is decided by a coin toss at the beginning of a match. If the team winning the toss chooses to serve, the other team has the choice of side and vice versa. \nAt the beginning of a match the referee allows two trials, one from each side. After the trials are over, the umpire shall call \"play\" and regular play begins. A ball is in play from the time a player attempts to serve until it touches the ground or until a \"fault\" or \"let\" (a re-serve) is called by the umpire.\n\nThe officiating team consists of one umpire, two or more line referees and a scorer. When the umpire calls \"play\", if a team refuses to play it forfeits the match. The umpire is the sole judge on the fairness of a play, weather and lighting conditions. His decisions are final. It is the umpire's responsibility to call \"fault\" or \"let\", with (or without) an appeal from the players. If an umpire erroneously calls \"fault\" and immediately corrects himself and calls \"play\" but the striker fails to return the ball, a \"let\" is allowed. Umpires serve for an entire match, unless a change is authorized by the tournament committee. Each of the two (or more) line referees is responsible for one boundary line and one half of the side line opposite the umpire, in addition to any other duties assigned by the umpire. Referees signal the umpire in a code prescribed by the BFF. The scorer records the points scored and the number of hands on the score sheet. A ball may be replaced by an umpire if it is lost or damaged. The umpire can overrule a line referee's decision, if he feels that an error has been committed.\n\nThe umpire is also responsible for the net. He announces the score (for the benefit of the scorer) when a point is scored or a server is out. In announcing the score he calls the number of the serving hand, followed by the score of the serving team and the score of the other team.\nIf a match is suspended by the umpire for any reason (e.g. weather and light), it is resumed from the point at which it was stopped. In case of a tie between two or more teams in any tournament, a match is not replayed. If the tie is unbroken, teams are ranked based on game and point scores. In a league tournament, if two (or more) teams have identical won/lost records their game scores are used to break the tie.\n\nGame Scoring\n\nThe number of games won and lost by each team in each league match is recorded. Keeping in mind that each match is played as a best of three games, a team winning a match after three games has won two games and lost one. If a team wins a match in two straight games, its official won/lost record is 3–0. The losing team in each case has a record of 1–2 and 0–3, respectively. The difference between the number of games won and lost is a team's game score. The team with the highest game score is the winner in the event of a tie; if two or more teams have the same game score, their point scores will also break the tie.\n\nPoint Score\n\nPoints scored in each game by each team in all league matches are recorded. A team winning a match in two straight games, after recording the points scored for and against in the two games played also receives 35 points in favour and zero points against for the third (unplayed) game. Correspondingly, zero points in favour and 35 points against are recorded for the losing team. The difference between total points in favour and against in all the matches is a team's point score. The team scoring the most net points (for minus against) is the winner.\n\nThe umpire can warn a player if the player behaves on-court in a manner bringing discredit to the referee, other players or the officials, or otherwise lowering the image of the game. A second warning triggers a yellow card. A third warning triggers a red card and ejection from the game; following a red card, the player's team continues with four players. A team manager substitute for a player shown a yellow card, if a sufficient number of substitutions remain.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2311171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311171", "title": "Blackbird Leys", "text": "Blackbird Leys\n\nBlackbird Leys is a civil parish and ward in Oxford, England. According to the 2011 census, the population of the ward (whose boundaries may change occasionally so as to ensure minimal malapportionment) stood at 6,077. Unlike most parts of the City of Oxford, the area has a civil parish. The civil parish was created in 1990. In 2011 the population was recorded as 13,100.\n\nThere was a Bronze Age or Iron Age settlement on the site. Evidence has been found suggesting pits and roundhouses, with remains of pottery and a cylindrical loom weight of a kind previously known only from East Anglia. The area was originally called Blackford Leys; \"blackford\" after the dark-coloured ford which crossed the southern branch of Northfield Brook at the entrance to Blackbird Leys farm. The ford would be located where Windale Avenue crosses Northfield Brook. The farm was also called Blackford Leys farm. The Middle English \"leys\" meaning pasture or meadow.\n\nThe Blackbird Leys Estate was built mainly in the 1950s and 1960s to meet the then pressing need for housing. It was part of a plan to re-house people from the dilapidated inner city. This included large-scale clearance of a site near to where the Oxford Ice Rink was built (The Oxpens). Many of the families that moved onto the estate originally came from this area. It was also a convenient site for factory workers at the Morris Motors Limited plant in nearby Cowley. \n\nThe area has traditionally been staunchly Labour. The Independent Working Class Association performed strongly in the mid-2000s, holding three of the four council seats on Oxford City Council between 2006 and 2008. The local MP from 1987 to 2017 Andrew Smith lives on the estate. His late wife Valerie Smith was also one of the City councillors and County Councillors for the area and a former Lord Mayor of Oxford.\n\nIn stark contrast to Oxford as a whole, which had a Remain result of 71% in the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership, Blackbird Leys and neighbouring estates voted narrowly to leave the European Union.\n\nAround this time, Blackbird Leys suffered from joy riding. Young men from the estate would steal cars and 'display' them (with a variety of high-speed stunts) to an audience gathered outside the estate shops (known locally as the 'top shops'). Following a crackdown by police on joyriding in September 1991, some 150 youths stoned police officers. Two women suffered stab wounds and two men suffered other injuries during the riots. Local MP, Andrew Smith, stated in 1991 that the extensive national media coverage of confrontations with the police in August and September left many of the wider public with a distorted picture of the problem. Some say journalists visiting helped encourage some of the action for filming. \n\nCrime levels have decreased consistently since 2004, a change thought to be due to a higher police presence on the estate though both recorded crime and rates found in the British Crime Survey have fallen across England and Wales.\n\nThe Kassam Stadium is the home of Oxford United Football Club and is just within the greater boundary of Blackbird Leys in an area known as Minchery Farm. Initial construction begun in 1996 and the first football match took place on 4 August 2001.\n\nIn 2006, residents from the estate took part in \"The Singing Estate\", a Channel Five reality TV show following their progress from amateur singers to classical choir. The Blackbird Leys Choir emerged from the original choir and continues today.\n\nSchools on the estate include Pegasus First School, Windale Community Primary School and Northfield School. City of Oxford College has a campus situated on Cuddesdon Way which provides further education, higher education, modern apprenticeships and community evening classes.\n\nBlackbird Leys has no mainline railway station but is served by Oxford Bus Company and Stagecoach in Oxfordshire which provides bus services between Blackbird Leys, central Oxford and Oxford railway station. The freight-only railway between Kennington Junction and the BMW Mini factory via Iffley and Littlemore forms the northwestern boundary of Blackbird Leys. It is part of the former Wycombe Railway that British Railways closed to passenger traffic in 1963.\n\nBlackbird Leys has two places of worship, The Church of the Holy Family which was dedicated on 10 April 1965 and Sacred Heart Catholic Church.\n\n"}

He articulated the bulk of his theory in his book of 1932, \"Die spätantike Alphabet-Mystik und die Runenreihe\" [The Alphabet-mysticism of late antiquity and the sequence of the runes].\n\nThe suggestion has not been accepted in mainstream runic studies, due to lack of historical sources, but has found proponents in occult circles and in popular culture.\n\nKenneth Meadows promoted the Uthark theory in his 1995 book \"Rune Power\".

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 15,356.\n\nAccording to some scholars, Tarki sits on the site of Samandar, the capital of Khazaria until the early 8th century. In 1396, Timur passed through Tarki during the Tokhtamysh–Timur war. In the middle ages the Shamkhalate state is formed, lately becoming Shamkhalate of Tarki. Tarki had been the capital of the Kumyk state at least from the 16th century. This state was not abolished until 1867.\n\nTarki is mentioned by Armenian chronicles of the 7-8th century Giovanni Carpini in 13th century, on the Catalan Atlas of 1375, by Timurid historians\n\nThe shamkhals submitted to Russian authority more than once, first in the early 17th century. In 1668, the town was sacked by cossacks under Stepan Razin. The shamkhals were again obliged to submit to Russian suzerainty during Peter the Great's 1722 Persian Expedition and during Catherine the Great's 1796 Persian Expedition. \n\nTarki finally passed to Russia under the terms of the Treaty of Gulistan (1813). Eight years later, the Russians built Burnaya Fortress there, which was succeeded by Fort-Petrovsk and original Kumyk name Andzhi-kala, now known as Makhachkala.\n\nBy the decree of Stalin's government on the 12 of April 1944 Kumyk population of historical Kumyk capital Tarki and adjacent villages was deported to the lands of entirely deported to the Middle Asia Chechens (Karachays, Balkars and Crimean Tatars also were deported). The reason was stated as \"freeing the area for the agricultural needs\" of the resettling there mountaineer peoples. The deportation, despite the Russian laws is still not acknowledged by the Russian government. As a result of this event, local population lost for years their ancient capital of Tarki, which led to the permanent destruction of the majority of the cultural inheritance.\n\nUrban-type settlement status was granted to Tarki in 1958.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, the urban-type settlement of Tarki is in jurisdiction of Sovetsky City District of the City of Makhachkala.

It is Hawaii's second oldest bank and its largest locally owned bank in that the majority of the voting stockholders reside within the state. Bank of Hawaii has the most accounts, customers, branches, and ATMs of any financial institution in the state (although BancWest's First Hawaiian Bank holds a greater number of dollars in deposits). The bank consists of four business segments: retail banking, commercial banking, investment services, and treasury. The bank is currently headed by chairman, president and chief executive officer, Peter S. Ho.\n\nIn 1893, Charles Montague Cooke (1849–1909) with his brother-in-law Joseph Ballard Atherton and business partner Peter Cushman Jones founded Bank of Hawaii. In 1897, it was chartered in the Republic of Hawaii by Interior Minister James A. King. A decade after its founding, in 1903, the bank opened its first branch in Kauai. In 1922, the bank acquired First Bank of Hilo, which had four branches. In 1930, it amalgamated Bank of Maui.\n\nCharles Dexter Lufkin organized First National Bank of Wailuku in 1901. Five years later, he had organized Lahaina National Bank. Then he organized the First National Bank of Paia in 1913. Lastly, in 1917, First National Bank of Paia merged with Lahaina National Bank and First National Bank of Wailuku to form Bank of Maui.\n\nIn 1971, BOH formed a bank holding company called Hawaii Bancorporation.\n\nIn 1979, Hawaii Bancorporation changed its name to Bancorp Hawaii. In 1985, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Hawaiian Trust Company for $19 million.\n\nIn 1990, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired FirstFed America Inc. with its First Federal Savings and Loan Association in Hawaii and First Savings of Guam subsidiaries for $141 million in cash. First Federal Savings was maintained as a separate entity until 1998 when it was merged into the Bank of Hawaii.\n\nBancorp Hawaii changed its name to Pacific Century Financial Corporation (PCFC) in 1997.\n\nLarge drop in the firm's stock in early 2000 caused by bad loans and quick expansion outside of the firm's core business of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa led to a change in management.\n\nBOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation sold off its credit card division to American Express for an undisclosed amount in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Pacific Century Financial Corporation was renamed Bank of Hawaii Corporation.\n\nIn its first expansion onto the continental United States, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Phoenix, Arizona-based First National Bancorp of Arizona with its five-office First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary for an undisclosed amount in 1987. Ten years later, through its First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary, BOH acquired all four Arizona branch offices from Home Savings of America for an undisclosed amount in 1997 and merged those offices into First National while at nearly the same time changed the name of First National to Pacific Century Bank NA.\n\nThe following year, BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation acquired the Encino, California-based CU Bancorp with its California United Bank subsidiary for $183 million in stock and cash. Just shortly after the acquisition was finalized in 1998, California United and its 22 offices in Southern California was merged into Phoenix-based Pacific Century Bank and the headquarters for the newly combined Pacific Century Bank was moved to Encino.\n\nAfter 14 years on the Mainland, BOH decided to abandon their activities on the Mainland in 2001 by selling all 9 Arizona branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to Zions Bancorporation for an undisclosed amount and all 20 California branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to U.S. Bancorp for an undisclosed amount. Zion merged their purchase into their National Bank of Arizona subsidiary.\n\nIt was not until 1959 that BOH made another novel move when it opened its first Pacific Islands branch on Kwajalein. Two years later, it opened a branch in both Palau and Guam. Ten years later, BOH continued its international expansion by absorbing Bank of American Samoa, which the Navy had established in 1914. That same year, it created \"Banque de Tahiti\" as a joint venture between itself and Crédit Lyonnais. The next year, BOH established a branch in Yap. Branches in Ponape and Kosrae followed in the subsequent years.\n\nIt also continued its expansion outside Hawaii with the establishment of a branch in Saipan. Three years later, BOH and Crédit Lyonnais established another joint-venture, \"Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie\" in Nouméa.\n\nIn 1980, BOH opened a branch in Tokyo.\n\nBOH acquired Wells Fargo Bank's Seoul, Korea, and Singapore operations in 1991. Two years later, it acquired Banque Indosuez's operations in Vanuatu, which became Banque d’Hawaii (Vanuatu). That same year, BOH also opened its first branch in Suva, Fiji in 1993. Branches in Nadi and Lautoka followed. In 1994, BOH acquired Commonwealth Bank of Australia's 51% ownership in the National Bank of Solomon Islands. BOH also acquired Crédit Lyonnais' holdings in Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie, giving BOH 91 percent ownership.\n\nBanque de Nouvelle Calédonie changed its name to Bank of Hawaii—Nouvelle Calédonie. BOH also purchased Banque Indosuez Nuigini in Papua New Guinea from Banque Indosuez for $5.6 million and renamed it Bank of Hawaii (PNG) Ltd. In addition to its main office in Port Moresby, Bank of Hawaii (PNG) also had an office in Lae, PNG's second port city on the Northeast Coast. Indosuez Nuigini was established in 1983 with 49 percent Indosuez participation, 41.5 percent Bank of Papua New Guinea, and the remainder public.\n\nIn 1998, BOH bought 5.4mn convertible notes of Bank of Queensland for $22 million as part of a strategic alliance giving rise to a true reflecting of the convertible note value into 49% ownership at that time. It also acquired 100 percent of \"Banque Paribas Pacifique\" (est. 1972; 3 branches) and 70 percent of \"Banque Paribas Polynésie\" (est. 1984; 1 branch). BOH integrated the operations with Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Calédonie and Banque de Tahiti, respectively. In 1999, BOH bought 5.8mn shares (approx. 10 percent) in Bank of Queensland.\n\nIn 2001, BOH sold its 6.2mn shares and 5.4mn convertible notes in Bank of Queensland for $20 million and $16 million respectively. The decision reflected PCFC's new strategic plan, which mandated a focus on the bank's core markets in Hawaii, American Samoa, and Guam. BOH sold its shareholding in the \"Bank of Tonga\" and \"Pacific Commercial Bank of Samoa\" to Westpac. BOH and Westpac both had 30 percent interests in Bank of Tonga and 42 percent interests in Pacific Commercial Bank. BOH sold its operations in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and Fiji to ANZ for AU$100 million. BOH sold its approximately 95 percent share interest in its French Polynesia and New Caledonia operations to France-based \"Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne\" (CNCE). Its operations in French Polynesia included 17 branches of its subsidiary, Banque de Tahiti, and about 265 employees. Its operations in New Caledonia included eight branches of subsidiary Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Caledonie and about 190 employees. Lastly, BOH closed its offices in Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, and Taipei.\n\nIn 2002, BOH was unable to find a buyer for its bank properties in the Central Pacific when it was trying to withdraw from those markets. As a result, BOH closed its Majuro branch in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and its three branches in Pohnpei, Yap, and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). BOH turned over its 51 percent interest in National Bank of Solomon Islands to the government of the Solomon Islands.\n\nPoor performance by the bank in early 2000, contributed to chairman and CEO Lawrence M. Johnson's resignation in 2000 and bank president Richard Dahl being passed over as Johnson's replacement. Dahl left the company in 2002.\n\nIn November 2000, Michael E. O'Neill was hired from outside the company to serve as chairman and CEO to correct mistakes made by the previous management. O'Neill did not take a salary or any bonuses during his three years at the helm, but in 2004 he controlled about 2.73 million — about 5 percent — of the bank's total shares directly or under option. O'Neill reversed the company's decline by selling off properties outside the company's core business area of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa. O'Neill stepped down as chairman and CEO in 2004.\n\nIn December 2003, Allan R. Landon was promoted from chief financial officer to president and later to chairman and CEO upon O'Neill leaving in September 2004. Under Landon's leadership, the Bank of Hawaii \"survived the financial crisis without federal assistance and prospered in its aftermath\".\n\nIn 2008, Landon handed his position of president to Peter S. Ho while Landon retained his chairman and CEO posts. Two years later Ho was given the additional titles of chairman and chief executive officer in addition to president upon the retirement of Allan R. Landon in 2010.\n\n"}

He was the inventor of one of the first forms of the waterbed, the Arnott waterbed. and was awarded the Rumford Medal in 1852 for the construction of the smokeless fire grate, as well as other improvements to ventilation and heating.\n\nHe was born in Arbroath, the son of Alexander Arnott and his wife, Ann MacLean of Borreray. He came from a line of master bakers.\n\nNeil Arnott was a distinguished graduate of Marischal College, University of Aberdeen (AM, 1805; MD 1814) and subsequently studied in London under Sir Everard Home (1756–1832), through whom he obtained, when only eighteen, the appointment of full surgeon to an East Indiaman. After making two voyages to China acting as a surgeon in the service of the British East India Company (1807-9 and 1810–11), he settled in London where he practised from 1811–1854, and quickly acquired a high reputation. He gave lectures at the Philomathic Institution published as \"Elements of physics\" (1827). He was one of the founders of the University of London, 1836. Within a few years he was made physician to the French and Spanish embassies, and in 1837 he became physician extraordinary to the Queen. He was elected to the Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1838.\n\nHe was a strong advocate of scientific, as opposed to purely classical, education; and he manifested interest in natural philosophy by the gift of 2,000 pounds to each of the four universities of Scotland and to the University of London, to promote its study in the experimental and practical form.\n\nHe died in London in 1874 but is buried with his mother in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. The simple obelisk lies in the north-west section of the original cemetery, west of the large Beattie obelisk.\n\nHe was the author of several works on physical science or its applications, the most important being his \"Elements of Physics\" (1827), which went through six editions in his lifetime. In 1838 he published a treatise on warming and ventilating, and in 1855, one on the smokeless fireplace.\n\n\nArnott was a strong advocate for a natural view of health and on the causes of various diseases. In his paper “On the Fevers Which Have Prevailed Edinburgh and Glasgow,” Arnott noted “It gives remarkable simplicity to all inquiries respecting health, to know that among the things and influences around man on earth, in regard to which he can exercise control, there are only four which he needs to obtain, and two which he needs to avoid, that he may have uninterrupted health for as long as the human constitution is formed to last; in other words, that only by some want or misuse of the requisites, or by the direct agency of the noxious agencies can his health be impaired or his life be shortened.” Arnott believed that the four items that needed to be obtained in order to be healthy were fit air, temperature, aliment, and exercise of the mind and of the body, and that if an individual had access to all four of these items, while avoiding violence and poisons (items that Arnott believed caused disease and therefore were to be avoided), that the individual would have no issues when it came to health throughout their life and would be able to live for as long as the body permits one to live, and that by surrounding oneself with the four essential items, the human bodily makeup would slowly become modified by “kindred circumstances not deemed diseases but called temperaments and varieties, compatible with health and long life.” Arnott also referenced the findings of the report made to the Poor Law Commissioners in his paper \"Sanitary Inquiry-\"Scotland, and regarded the contents of this report as facts, making note of the claim that malaria was caused by the exhalation released during putrefaction or decomposition of animal and vegetable substances.\n\nFrom his earliest youth, Arnott had an intense love of natural philosophy, and to this added an inventiveness which served him in good stead in his profession. This inventiveness helped him to design the Arnott waterbed in the 19th century that was devised to prevent bedsores in invalids. The bed was composed of a bath of water with a covering of rubber-impregnated canvas, on which lighter bedding was placed. However, Arnott didn't patent his design, and without a patent, anyone was able to construct a bed in this design. The design was later developed into a water-filled chair intended to prevent seasickness. Other inventions include the Arnott ventilator and the Arnott stove.\n\nAttribution:\n"}

The emphasis is on contemporary photograph and video presentations, with the focus on Man and society. \n\nThe museum consists of three different buildings, the Vleeshal (Flesher's hall) on the east side and the Verweyhal (named for Kees Verwey) on the west side are two large \"halls\" sandwiching the small entrance building. All three buildings are National Heritage sites today.\n\nThe Vleeshal was built in the years 1602 to 1605 and was originally a ‘meat hall’ where butchers sold their goods. The heads of bulls and rams on the façades are reminders of the original function of the building. It is an example of Dutch Renaissance architecture, with Renaissance ornaments being applied on a basic Gothic structure (floor plan and outer walls). The Renaissance forms include pilasters, rustication, Tuscan (interior) pillars, scrollwork (above the cellar entrances) and obelisks. Sample prints by Hans Vredeman de Vries from Antwerp provided a source of inspiration for this. De Vleeshal was built by Lieven de Key, the town architect, commissioned by the city government, which judging by the finished building had a substantial treasury at the time. It remained a meat hall all the way into the 19th century.\n\nThe building later fulfilled a totally different function; from 1840 to 1885 it served as a storehouse for a garrison quartered in Haarlem. Later the building served as a Public Records Office, and after that as a depot for the municipal library. During the Second World War the building was occupied by the Distribution Service.\n\nAfter World War II, the Mayor and Aldermen decreed that the building should become an exhibition hall, and the first exhibitions were held in 1950. De Hallen Haarlem organises alternating exhibitions of contemporary art on two storeys, throughout summer combined with modern art. The Archeological Museum is in the cellar.\n\nThe little ‘fish house’ in between the two main halls was once the home of the servant of the fish market across the square and serves as the entrance for Frans Hals Museum - Hal today. \n\nThe Verweyhal is a former society meeting hall next to the main entrance on the corner of the Grote Markt and the Grote Houtstraat, where the former main entrance to it is located. The Verweyhal was built in the 19th century as a home for the Haarlem gentlemen’s society Trou moet Blycken.\n\nThe building is in the Eclectic style and also contains some art deco features in the interior though it has been renovated beyond recognition since 1880. It became a modern art exhibition hall in 1992 when the Kees Verwey Foundation renovated it and gave the artist's oeuvre to the Frans Hals Museum.\n"}

{"id": "2311206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311206", "title": "WS-Addressing", "text": "WS-Addressing\n\nWeb Services Addressing (WS-Addressing) is a specification of transport-neutral mechanism that allows web services to communicate addressing information. It essentially consists of two parts: a structure for communicating a reference to a Web service endpoint, and a set of message addressing properties which associate addressing information with a particular message.\n\nWS-Addressing is a standardized way of including message routing data within SOAP headers. Instead of relying on network-level transport to convey routing information, a message utilizing WS-Addressing may contain its own dispatch metadata in a standardized SOAP header. The network-level transport is only responsible for delivering that message to a dispatcher capable of reading the WS-Addressing metadata. Once that message arrives at the dispatcher specified in the URI, the job of the network-level transport is done.\n\nWS-Addressing supports the use of asynchronous interactions by specifying a common SOAP header (wsa:ReplyTo) that contains the endpoint reference (EPR) to which the response is to be sent. The service provider transmits the response message over a separate connection to the wsa:ReplyTo endpoint. This decouples the lifetime of the SOAP request/response interaction from the lifetime of the HTTP request/response protocol, thus enabling long-running interactions that can span arbitrary periods of time.\n\nAn endpoint reference (EPR) is an XML structure encapsulating information useful for addressing a message to a Web service. This includes the destination address of the message, any additional parameters (called reference parameters) necessary to route the message to the destination, and optional metadata (such as WSDL or WS-Policy) about the service.\n\nMessage addressing properties communicate addressing information relating to the delivery of a message to a Web service:\n\nWS-Addressing was originally authored by Microsoft, IBM, BEA, Sun Microsystems, and SAP and submitted to W3C for standardization. The W3C WS-Addressing Working Group has refined and augmented the specification in the process of standardization.\n\nWS-Addressing is currently specified in three parts:\n\nWeb Services Policy Attachment for Endpoint Reference (WS-PAEPR) specifies the mechanism and meaning of including WS-Policy expressions in Endpoint References. WS-PAEPR is a W3C Member Submission.\n\n"}

{"id": "2311212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311212", "title": "Double Impact", "text": "Double Impact\n\nDouble Impact is a 1991 American action film written and directed by Sheldon Lettich, and written, produced by and starring Jean-Claude van Damme in a dual role as Chad and Alex Wagner. The film marks Van Damme's third collaboration with director Sheldon Lettich (\"Bloodsport\" and \"Lionheart\") and second collaboration with Bolo Yeung (the first being \"Bloodsport\" in 1988).\n\n\"Double Impact\" was released in the United States on August 9, 1991.\n\nBusiness partners Paul Wagner and Nigel Griffith open the Hong Kong Victoria Harbour tunnel. Paul attends with his wife and their twin infant sons, Chad and Alex. \n\nAfter the celebration, the family is followed home by their bodyguard, Frank Avery, whom they dismiss. Once he leaves, a Triad hit squad follows them. A shootout ensues, in which Paul is killed. Paul's wife begs the Triads to spare the twins but is killed by Moon, the top henchman. Their maid is able to escape with Alex and Frank eventually saves Chad; the maid leaves Alex at a Hong Kong orphanage and Frank raises Chad in France.\n\n25 years later, Chad and Frank are running a successful martial arts dojo in Los Angeles when Frank reveals a new \"business\" for the two of them in Hong Kong. The two go to a mahjong parlor and a woman, mistaking Chad for Alex, takes him back to Alex's room. When Alex arrives, he knocks out Chad for being with his girlfriend, Danielle Wilde. \n\nFrank tells them they are brothers and they need to join together to take down Griffith and get their part of the royalties from the tunnel, but Chad and Alex initially do not get along with each other. Alex takes them out on his boat to sell smuggled Mercedes and cigarettes to some Chinese buyers, but the Hong Kong Police arrive and Chad dumps the cars to escape the cops faster.\n\nBack in Hong Kong, some thugs kidnap and beat up Chad (mistaking him for Alex) when he refuses to work for their leader, Raymong Zhang. Danielle, who works for Griffith, begins checking his private files for information, but she is being watched closely by Griffith's bodyguard, Kara.\n\nAlex takes Chad and Frank to an abandoned hotel on an island to conduct their operations. With intelligence from Danielle, they attack a drug operation and blow it up. Next, they attack a club frequented by Zhang by pretending to bring him Cognac smuggled from France, which is actually just crates of bombs, although they fail to kill Zhang. Danielle continues to search for information but is caught and sexually molested by Kara. Danielle later calls the hideout revealing she has found something, but her phone is tapped by Griffith.\n\nUnable to find Alex and Frank who are out gathering firewood, Chad takes the boat to rescue Danielle by himself. However, Alex becomes paranoid and begins drinking heavily while imagining Chad and Danielle having sex. Chad brings Danielle home, but Kara follows them in a helicopter and discovers their hideout. When they return, Alex attacks Chad in a drunken rage before the brothers angrily part ways for the night.\n\nThe next morning Chad and Alex awaken to see Triads landing on the beach and, although they kill several, Frank and Danielle are captured. They capture one Triad who reveals that Frank and Danielle have been taken to Zhang's boat at a pier. Chad and Alex board and fight their way through the ship; Chad kills Moon (who beat him when he was kidnapped earlier) and he and Alex rescue Frank and Danielle. \n\nAfterwards, the brothers split up: Chad pursues Griffith and Alex chases Zhang. Alex eventually kills Zhang when he falls to his death from atop a crane. Chad and Danielle are chased through a maze of shipping containers until Griffith threatens to crush Chad with a forklift holding a container. Chad jumps into the water, sneaks around into the forklift, and drops the container on Griffith, killing him. Alex, Chad, Danielle and Frank reunite after the ordeal and appear to set aside their differences.\n\nVan Damme was reportedly paid $600,000 for the movie. Wanting to breakaway from the martial arts movie genre he had become so popularly known for, he hoped playing the dual role of Chad/Alex would change his image and help him do just that. \"[Alex] is violent and [Chad] is not, so audiences [will] see the contrast in my work.\" Prior to the films release, he had told the \"Los Angeles Times\": \"If I stay in martial arts pictures people will get tired of my films.\" Van Damme felt \"Double Impact\"'s love scene would appeal to a wider audience. Seeing Jeremy Irons portray a dual role in \"Dead Ringers\" allegedly influenced Van Damme's decision. \n\nDirector Sheldon Lettich co wrote the script with Van Damme. Inspiration was taken from Alexandre Dumas' \"The Corsican Brothers\"; an 1844 novella about twins separated at birth, who find each other in adulthood. Lettich later recalled the concept of Van Damme playing twins \"was so successful that other producers wanted him to repeat it.\" (\"Timecop, Maximum Risk, Replicant\") \"Even though it meant a lot more work for Jean-Claude, he enjoyed the challenge of playing two distinctly different characters, showcasing a dark and a more light-hearted side in the same movie.\"\n\n\"Double Impact\" opened on August 9, 1991 to a generally mixed-negative critical response.\n\nCalling the plot \"minimal\" at best, Chris Hicks, of Deseret News, gave a negative review. He went on to say: \"the story makes no sense and is often more laughable than exciting.\" Whilst adding that this \"probably won't deter fans,\" Hicks noted \"more gunplay here than in most Van Damme efforts, which may or may not be an improvement.\" \"Van Damme's idea of a love scene is a soft-lens, soft-core moment as he and newcomer Alonna Shaw roll around nude in a paranoid fantasy sequence. So much for romance.\"\n\nCaryn James, of the New York Times, said: \"there is plenty of gunfire and karate kicks and explosives set off by remote control. Chad gets bomped in the head more often than Alex. There are some Van Damme-style showdowns with various villains, with whirls and tricks that seem to owe something to the Three Stooges. There are golden oldies like smashing someone in the head with a whisky bottle and kicking him in the crotch. As it turns out, two Jean-Claude Van Dammes are pretty much the same as one. Fans who like their action unadultered by story, character or acting know where to find it.\"\n\nRenowned critic Roger Ebert awarded the film two stars, saying: \"it has a budget and production values of a lesser James Bond movie.\" However, Ebert gave credit for the \"slick product values\" and \"few clever lines.\" He went on to compare Van Damme to fellow martial artist and actor Steven Seagal; in that they \"are always at the center of their plots. [This] will hurt their careers in the long run, since martial arts movies are limited by their formulas, and the heroes are supplied with almost ritualistic plot patterns.\" Ebert believed both would make \"splendid villains in more ambitious movies.\"\n\nDespite calling the plot \"elementary but serviceable\", Kevin Thomas, of the Los Angeles Times, gave a positive review, saying: \"[\"Double Impact\"] offers two Jean-Claude Van Dammes for the price of one, and for fans of the Belgian-born martial arts star, it delivers the goods. It’s a solid, fast-moving action-adventure set largely in Hong Kong, which is dynamically photographed by Richard Kline.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the review aggregator, \"Double Impact\" has an approval rating of 35% based on 20 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\"Double Impact\" was a commercial hit and spotted at No. 2 at the US box office; grossing $7.5 million in its opening weekend. By August 20, 1991; 11 days after the initial release, this increased to $15.3 million. According to Box Office Mojo, domestic receipts totalled $30.1 million by the end of the films theatrical run.\n\nThe score by Arthur Kempel was released as the \"Double Impact Original Soundtrack Recordings\" on 1993 by Silva America. The soundtrack was released on CD contained twelve tracks with a runtime of 40 minutes.\n\nVan Damme and Lettich had been discussing a potential sequel for \"many years.\" Whilst promoting \"The Expendables 2\" in 2012, Van Damme confirmed a sequel was in the works. That same year, Lettich completed a treatment based on a story by Van Damme; \"along with 25 pages of screenplay.\" \"Double Impact 2\" was envisioned by Van Damme to be more serious in tone than the original.\n\nPlans for a sequel fell through as far back as 2015. The sequel was \"ambitious\" and would have been expensive to produce. Lettich said \"there were a lot of logistical problems. Mostly around who owned the rights.\" It turned out that \"MGM owned the majority of the rights\" and \"acquiring them was not going to be cheap.\" Furthermore, \"the studio had to be included as a co-partner with any producing entity\", which allegedly made the \"process even more difficult and complicated\" given MGM's apparent unwillingness to financially back the sequel. \n\nIn 2019, a restored 35mm film-version of \"Double Impact\" was screened at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin, Texas. Lettich reaffirmed the cancellation and told fans during the Q&A that \"perhaps the biggest reason [a sequel] didn’t happen was in fact due to the [original] film’s success.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2311219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311219", "title": "Munich (film)", "text": "Munich (film)\n\nMunich is a 2005 historical action thriller movie, produced and directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth. It is based on the 1984 book \"Vengeance\" by George Jonas, an account of Operation Wrath of God, the Israeli government's secret retaliation against the Palestine Liberation Organization after the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics.\n\n\"Munich\" received five Oscar nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing and Best Score. The film made $130 million worldwide but just $47 million in the United States, making it one of Spielberg's lowest-grossing films domestically. In 2017, the film was named the 16th \"Best Film of the 21st Century So Far\" by \"The New York Times\".\n\nAt the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, the Palestinian terrorist group Black September kills eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team. Avner Kaufman, a Mossad agent of German-Jewish descent, is chosen to lead a mission to assassinate 11 Palestinians allegedly involved in the massacre. At the direction of his handler Ephraim, to give the Israeli government plausible deniability, Avner resigns from Mossad and operates with no official ties to Israel. His team includes four Jewish volunteers from around the world: South African driver Steve, Belgian toy-maker and explosives expert Robert, former Israeli soldier and \"cleaner\" Carl, and Danish document forger Hans. They are given information by a French informant, Louis.\n\nIn Rome, the team shoots and kills Wael Zwaiter, who is living as a poet. In Paris, they detonate a bomb in the home of Mahmoud Hamshari; in Cyprus, they bomb the hotel room of Hussein Abd Al Chir. With IDF commandos, they pursue three Palestinian militants—Muhammad Youssef al-Najjar, Kamal Adwan, and Kamal Nasser—to Beirut, penetrate the Palestinians' guarded compound and kill all three.\n\nBetween hits, the assassins argue about the morality and logistics of their mission, expressing fear about their individual lack of experience, as well as ambivalence about accidentally killing innocent bystanders. Avner makes a brief visit to his wife, who has given birth to their first baby. In Athens, when they track down Zaiad Muchasi, the team finds out that Louis arranged for them to share a safe house with their rival PLO members and the Mossad agents escape trouble by pretending to be members of foreign militant groups like ETA, IRA, ANC, and the Red Army Faction. Avner has a heartfelt conversation with PLO member Ali over their homelands and who deserves to rule over the lands; Ali is later shot by Carl while the team escapes from the hit on Muchasi.\n\nThe squad moves to London to track down Ali Hassan Salameh, who orchestrated the Munich Massacre, but the assassination attempt is interrupted by several drunken Americans. It is implied that these are agents of the CIA, which, according to Louis, protects and funds Salameh in exchange for his promise not to attack US diplomats. Meanwhile, attempts are made on the assassins themselves. Carl is killed by an independent Dutch contract killer. In revenge, the team tracks her down and executes her at a houseboat in Hoorn, Netherlands. Hans is found stabbed to death on a park bench, and Robert is killed by an explosion in his workshop. Avner and Steve finally locate Salameh in Spain, but again their assassination attempt is thwarted, this time by Salameh's armed guards. It is implied that Louis has sold information on the team to the PLO.\n\nA disillusioned Avner flies to Israel, where he is unhappy to be hailed as a hero by two young soldiers and then to his new home in Brooklyn, where he suffers post-traumatic stress and paranoia. Concerns continue to grow when he speaks to Louis's father by phone and it is revealed he knows his real name and promises no violence will come to him from his family. He is thrown out of the Israeli consulate after storming in to demand that Mossad leave his wife and child alone. Ephraim comes to ask Avner to return to Israel and Mossad, but Avner refuses. Avner then asks Ephraim to come to dinner with family, to break bread as an allegory to make peace, but Ephraim refuses, perhaps as a sign that neither side will reconcile.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 78% approval rating based on 210 reviews, with an average rating of 7.45/10. The site's consensus reads, \"\"Munich\" can't quite achieve its lofty goals, but this thrilling, politically even-handed look at the fallout from an intractable political conflict is still well worth watching.\" Roger Ebert praised the film, saying, \"With this film [Spielberg] has dramatically opened a wider dialogue, helping to make the inarguable into the debatable.\" He placed it at No. 3 on his top ten list of 2005. James Berardinelli wrote that \"\"Munich\" is an eye-opener – a motion picture that asks difficult questions, presents well-developed characters, and keeps us white-knuckled throughout.\" He named it the best film of the year; it was the only film in 2005 to which Berardinelli gave four stars, and he also put it on his Top 100 Films of All Time list. \"Entertainment Weekly\" film critic Owen Gleiberman mentioned \"Munich\" amongst the best movies of the decade. Differently, Rex Reed from \"New York Observer\" belongs to the group of critics who didn't like the film: \"With no heart, no ideology and not much intellectual debate, \"Munich\" is a big disappointment, and something of a bore.\"\n\n\"Variety\" reviewer Todd McCarthy called \"Munich\" a \"beautifully made\" film. However, he criticized the film for failing to include \"compelling\" characters, and for its use of laborious plotting and a \"flabby script.\" McCarthy says that the film turns into \"...a lumpy and overlong morality play on a failed thriller template.\" To succeed, McCarthy states that Spielberg would have needed to engage the viewer in the assassin squad leader's growing crisis of conscience and create a more \"sustain(ed) intellectual interest\" for the viewer.\n\n\"Chicago Tribune\" reviewer Allison Benedikt calls \"Munich\" a \"competent thriller\", but laments that as an \"intellectual pursuit, it is little more than a pretty prism through which superficial Jewish guilt and generalized Palestinian nationalism\" are made to \"... look like the product of serious soul-searching.\" Benedikt states that Spielberg's treatment of the film's \"dense and complicated\" subject matter can be summed up as \"Palestinians want a homeland, Israelis have to protect theirs.\" She rhetorically asks: \"Do we need another handsome, well-assembled, entertaining movie to prove that we all bleed red?\"\n\nAnother critique was Gabriel Schoenfeld's \"Spielberg's 'Munich'\" in the February 2006 issue of \"Commentary\", who called it \"pernicious\". He compared the fictional film to history, asserted that Spielberg and especially Kushner felt that the Palestinian terrorists and the Mossad agents are morally equivalent and concluded: \"The movie deserves an Oscar in one category only: most hypocritical film of the year.\"\n\nWriting in \"Empire\", Ian Nathan wrote \"\"Munich\" is Steven Spielberg’s most difficult film. It arrives already inflamed by controversy... This is Spielberg operating at his peak — an exceptionally made, provocative, and vital film for our times.\"\n\nIn defense of the climactic sex scene, critics Jim Emerson of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" and Matt Zoller Seitz of \"Salon\" compared it to Lady Macbeth's suicide in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", interpreting the sequence as representing the corruption of Avner's personal life as a result of his being conditioned to kill others in order to avenge Munich.\n\n\"Munich\" was listed on many critics' top ten lists.\n\nSome reviewers criticized \"Munich\" for what they call the film's equating the Israeli assassins with \"terrorists\". Leon Wieseltier wrote in \"The New Republic\": \"Worse, \"Munich\" prefers a discussion of counter-terrorism to a discussion of terrorism; or it thinks that they are the same discussion\".\n\nMelman and other critics of the book and the film have said that the story's premise—that Israeli agents had second thoughts about their work—is not supported by interviews or public statements. In an interview with Reuters, a retired head of Israel's Shin Bet intelligence service and former Internal Security Minister, Avi Dichter, likened \"Munich\" to a children's adventure story: \"There is no comparison between what you see in the movie and how it works in reality\". In a \"Time\" magazine cover story about the film on December 4, 2005, Spielberg said that the source of the film had second thoughts about his actions. \"There is something about killing people at close range that is excruciating,\" Spielberg said. \"It's bound to try a man's soul.\" Of the real Avner, Spielberg says, \"I don’t think he will ever find peace.\"\n\nThe Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) - describing itself as \"the oldest, and one of the largest, pro-Israel and Zionist organizations in the United States\" - called for a boycott of the film on December 27, 2005. The ZOA criticized the factual basis of the film and leveled criticism at one of the screenwriters, Tony Kushner, whom the ZOA has described as an \"Israel-hater\". Criticism was also directed at the Anti-Defamation League's (ADL) National Director, Abraham Foxman, for his support of the film.\n\nDavid Edelstein of the online \"Slate\" magazine argued that \"The Israeli government and many conservative and pro-Israeli commentators have lambasted the film for naiveté, for implying that governments should never retaliate. But an expression of uncertainty and disgust is not the same as one of outright denunciation. What \"Munich\" does say is that this shortsighted tit-for-tat can produce a kind of insanity, both individual and collective.\"\n\nIllano Romano, wife of an Israeli weightlifter killed in the Munich massacre, said that Spielberg overlooked the Lillehammer affair, although Spielberg seems to have been conscious of the omission; the film's opening title frame shows \"Lillehammer\" in a montage of city names, with \"Munich\" standing out from the rest. The \"Jewish Journal\" said that \"the revenge squad obsess about making sure only their targets are hit -- and meticulous care is taken to avoid collateral damage. Yet in one shootout an innocent man is also slain ... The intense moral contortions the agents experience as the corpses pile up makes up the substance of the movie.\"\n\nAccording to Ronen Bergman as reported in \"Newsweek\", it is a myth that Mossad agents hunted down and killed those responsible for the killing of 11 Israeli athletes and a German policeman at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games; in fact most of the people were never killed or caught. Most of the people that Mossad did kill had nothing to do with the Munich deaths. He says the film was based on a book whose source was an Israeli who claimed to be the lead assassin of the hit squad, but in actual fact was a baggage inspector at Tel Aviv airport.\n\nAlthough \"Munich\" is a work of fiction, it describes many actual events and figures from the early 1970s. On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Golda Meir is depicted in the film, and other military and political leaders such as Attorney General Meir Shamgar, Mossad chief Zvi Zamir and Aman chief Aharon Yariv are also depicted. Spielberg tried to make the depiction of the hostage-taking and killing of the Israeli athletes historically authentic. Unlike an earlier film, \"21 Hours at Munich\", Spielberg's film depicts the shooting of \"all\" the Israeli athletes, which according to the autopsies was accurate. In addition, the film uses actual news clips shot during the hostage situation.\n\nThe named members of Black September, and their deaths, are also mostly factual. Abdel Wael Zwaiter, a translator at the Libyan Embassy in Rome, was shot 11 times, one bullet for each of the victims of the Munich Massacre, in the lobby of his apartment 41 days after Munich. On December 8 of that year Mahmoud Hamshari, a senior PLO figure, was killed in Paris by a bomb concealed in the table below his telephone. Although the film depicts the bomb being concealed in the telephone itself, other details of the assassination (such as confirmation of the target via telephone call) are accurate. Others killed during this period include Mohammed Boudia, Basil al-Kubasi, Hussein al-Bashir, and Zaiad Muchasi, some of whose deaths are depicted in the film. Ali Hassan Salameh was also a real person, and a prominent member of Black September. In 1979 he was killed in Beirut by a car bomb that also killed four innocent bystanders and injured 18 others.\n\nThe commando raid in Beirut, known as Operation Spring of Youth, also occurred. This attack included future Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yom Kippur War and Operation Entebbe hero Yonatan Netanyahu, who are both portrayed by name in the film. The methods used to track down and assassinate the Black September members were much more complicated than the methods portrayed in the film; for example, the tracking of the Black September cell members was achieved by a network of Mossad agents, not an informant as depicted in the film.\n\nAtlantic Productions, producers of BAFTA-nominated documentary \"\", listed several discrepancies between Spielberg's film and the information it obtained from interviews with Mossad agents involved in the operation. It noted that the film suggests one group carried out almost all the assassinations, whereas in reality it was a much larger team. Mossad did not work with a mysterious French underworld figure as portrayed in the book and the film. The assassination campaign did not end because agents lost their nerve but because of the Lillehammer affair in which an innocent Moroccan waiter was killed. This is not mentioned in the film. The targets were not all directly involved in Munich, which Spielberg only acknowledges in the last five minutes.\n\nAs mentioned above, the film notably ignored the Lillehammer affair, where Israeli assassins killed a Moroccan waiter, Ahmed Bouchiki, mistaking him for Ali Hassan Salameh. Bristol University History professor Stephen Howe says: \"one major puzzle has gone almost unremarked. If... the key (and in itself laudable) impetus for the film's making was the moral questioning prompted by Israeli 'counter-terrorist' actions, why focus on these particular episodes? The film doesn't even include the most glaring and notorious failure, which was also perhaps the most indefensible act... This was the killing in Norway of a hapless and harmless Moroccan waiter, mistaken for alleged Black September boss Ali Hassan Salameh.\" The agents who were responsible for the killing were tried and convicted in Norway of murder. Israel compensated the victim's family but never took responsibility for the assassination.\n\nThe film score was composed and conducted by John Williams.\n\nThe soundtrack album was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score but lost to the score of the film \"Brokeback Mountain\". It was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media but lost to the score of \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" (also scored by Williams).\n\n\"AllMusic\" rated the soundtrack three and a half stars out of five. Filmtracks.com rated it four out of five. SoundtrackNet rated it four and a half out of five. ScoreNotes graded it \"A-\".\n\n\n"}

He succeeded to his father's title and responsibilities on the latter's death in 1057. He gained the additional title of Earl of East Anglia, but also was exiled for a time. Through the first marriage of his daughter he would become father-in-law of the Welsh king Gruffydd ap Llywelyn; a few years after his death, his daughter would become a widow and marry English King Harold.\n\nÆlfgar profited from the exile of Earl Godwin of Wessex and his sons in 1051. He was given the Earldom of East Anglia, which had been that of Harold, son of Godwin. Earl Godwin and King Edward were reconciled the following year, so Harold was restored to his earldom—but not for long. At Easter 1053 Godwin died, so Harold became Earl of Wessex, and the earldom of East Anglia returned to Ælfgar.\n\nÆlfgar seems to have learned from the tactics Godwin used to put pressure on King Edward. When he was himself exiled in 1055, he raised a fleet of 18 ships in Ireland and then turned to Wales, where King Gruffydd agreed to join forces with him against King Edward. Two miles from Hereford, on 24 October, they clashed with the army of the Earl of Herefordshire, Ralph the Timid. The Earl and his men eventually took flight, and Gruffydd and Ælfgar pursued them, killing and wounding as they went, and enacting savage reprisals on Hereford. They despoiled and burnt the town, killing many of its citizens. King Edward ordered an army mustered and put Earl Harold in charge of it. This was more formidable opposition, and Ælfgar and Gruffydd fled to South Wales. However the issue was resolved by diplomacy and Earl Ælfgar was reinstated.\n\nÆlfgar is known to have had at least four children. One son, Burgheard, predeceased his father, expiring while returning from Rome early in 1060 and was buried at Reims. This led Ælfgar to give to Reims Abbey lands in Staffordshire and Shropshire, which became the endowment for Lapley Priory. He was survived by three children, two sons, Edwin, later Earl of Mercia, and Morcar, later Earl of Northumbria, and a daughter Ealdgyth, who was first married to Welsh king Gruffydd ap Llywelyn and later to Harold Godwinson, King of England.\n\nÆlfgar is believed to have died in 1060, well before the Battle of Hastings. His daughter's children, of the defeated King Harold, are believed to have lived in exile.\n"}

The ballpark had a seating capacity of 10,510, though it occasionally accommodated much larger crowds.\n\nThe stadium was located at the northeast corner of University Boulevard and Avenida Cesar Chavez. It was torn down and Isotopes Park was built to replace it.\n\nAlbuquerque Sports Stadium was built in a bowl excavated out of a large hill, so the playing field was significantly below grade level. The dimensions of the park were 360 feet to left field, 350 feet to right field, and 410 feet to center, approximately the same size as Tingley Field. The stadium was a fairly basic facility with a central concessions area, offices, and ticketing behind a single-level grandstand. One of the park's most unusual features was a \"drive in\" area in right field where fans could watch the game from their cars.\n\nTingley Field had been the home of Albuquerque's professional baseball teams since the Depression, and it was starting to show its age by the 1960s. City officials hoped a large new stadium located near the other sports venues in southeast Albuquerque would have a major economic impact and help the city attract a Triple-A team in the near future. Support was widespread, and in a 1968 special election voters approved $1 million in bonds for the project. This included $100,000 for the renovation of Tingley Field, with the rest going towards the new stadium.\n\nAlbuquerque Sports Stadium was designed by Albuquerque architect Max Flatow and cost just $1.4 million. It opened on March 31, 1969, with an exhibition game between the San Francisco Giants and the Cleveland Indians played in front of an overflow crowd of 13,767. The first batter to step up to the plate in the new stadium was Willie Mays.\n\nThe ballpark's first tenants were the Albuquerque Dodgers of the Double-A Texas League. In 1972 the city succeeded in acquiring a Triple-A team, the Pacific Coast League Albuquerque Dukes. The Dukes remained at Albuquerque Sports Stadium for the next 28 years. The 1993 Triple-A All-Star Game was held at Albuquerque Sports Stadium, with the National League defeating the American League, 14–3. The attendance was 10,541, and the game was broadcast on radio. Albuquerque's Billy Ashley was selected as the PCL MVP.\n\nBy the late 1990s, however, the stadium had become the second oldest in the league and was in disrepair. Dukes owner Bob Lozinak sold the team franchise to Portland in 2000, and Albuquerque Sports Stadium was torn down shortly thereafter. Isotopes Park was built in its place in 2003. Although supposedly a renovation of the old stadium, Isotopes Park was built almost entirely from scratch, and little of the old ballpark remains apart from the playing field.\n\nMany Dodger greats, including much of the championship teams of the Dodgers from the 1970s skippered by Tommy Lasorda played at the Albuquerque Sports Stadium, including Orel Hershiser, Pedro Martínez, Steve Garvey, Mike Piazza, and Paul Lo Duca.\n"}
{"id": "2311313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311313", "title": "The Jew of Linz", "text": "The Jew of Linz\n\nThe Jew of Linz is a 1998 book by Australian writer Kimberley Cornish, in which the author alleges that the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein had a profound effect on Adolf Hitler when they were both pupils at the Realschule (lower secondary school) in Linz, Austria, in the early 1900s. Cornish also alleges that Wittgenstein was involved in the Cambridge Five Soviet spy ring during the Second World War.\n\n\nCornish used a school photograph from the \"Realschule\" (lower secondary school) in Linz, Austria, on his book cover. That boy in the top-right corner is undisputedly Hitler (see above right). Cornish alleges that Wittgenstein is the boy on the bottom left; he says the Victoria Police photographic evidence unit in Australia examined the photograph and confirmed that it was \"highly probable\" the boy is Wittgenstein. German government\nand U.S. sources\ndate the photograph to 1901, slightly after Hitler's arrival at the school, but two years prior to Wittgenstein's enrollment. \n\nWittgenstein and Hitler both attended the Linz \"Realschule\", a state school of about 300 students, and were there at the same time only from 1903 to 1904, according to Wittgenstein's biographers. While Hitler was just six days older than Wittgenstein, they were two grades apart at the school—Hitler was repeating a year and Wittgenstein had been advanced a year. Cornish's thesis is not only that Hitler knew the young Wittgenstein, but that he hated him, and that Wittgenstein was specifically the one Jewish boy from his school days referred to in \"Mein Kampf\". The last claim referred to the following quote:\n\nCornish argues further that Hitler's anti-Semitism involved a projection of the young Wittgenstein's traits onto the whole Jewish people. Wittgenstein did have three Jewish grandparents but Wittgenstein himself, and his mother and father, were Roman Catholics.\n\nCornish also argues that Wittgenstein is the most likely suspect as recruiter of the \"Cambridge Five\" spy ring. The author suggests that Wittgenstein was responsible for British decryption technology for the German Enigma code reaching the Red Army and that he thereby enabled the Red Army victories on the Eastern Front that liberated the camps and ultimately overthrew the Reich.\n\nHe writes that the Soviet government offered Wittgenstein the chair in philosophy at what had been Lenin's university (Kazan) at a time (during the Great Purge) when ideological conformity was at a premium amongst Soviet academics and enforced by the very harshest penalties. Wittgenstein wanted to emigrate to Russia, first in the twenties, as he wrote in a letter to Paul Engelmann, and again in the thirties, either to work as a labourer or as a philosophy lecturer. Cornish argues that given the nature of the Soviet regime, the possibility that a non-Marxist philosopher (or even one over whom the government could exert no ideological control) would be offered such a post, is unlikely in the extreme.\n\nOther sections of the book deal with Cornish's theories about what he claims are the common roots of Wittgenstein's and Hitler's philosophies in mysticism, magic, and the \"no-ownership\" theory of mind. Cornish sees this as Wittgenstein's generalisation of Arthur Schopenhauer's account of the Unity of the Will, in which despite appearances, there is only a single Will acting through the bodies of all creatures. This doctrine, generalized to other mental faculties such as thinking, is presented in Ralph Waldo Emerson's \"Essays\". The doctrine, writes Cornish, was also held by the Oxford philosopher R. G. Collingwood who was one of Wittgenstein's electors to his Cambridge chair. Cornish tries to tie this to Wittgenstein's arguments against the idea of \"mental privacy\" and in conclusion says \"I have attempted to locate the source of the Holocaust in a perversion of early Aryan religious doctrines about the ultimate nature of man\". Cornish also suggests that Hitler's oratorical powers in addressing the group mind of crowds and Wittgenstein's philosophy of language and denial of mental privacy, are the practical and theoretical consequences of this doctrine.\n\nThe book proved controversial, with reviewers criticizing it for drawing unwarranted connections between disparate events. The main criticisms were that:\n\n\nOne of the main issues of contention is the claim that Wittgenstein triggered or substantially contributed to Hitler's antisemitism while they were at school together. It is a view that has some support. British professor Laurence Goldstein, in his \"Clear and Queer Thinking: Wittgenstein's Development and His Relevance to Modern Thought\" (1999), called Cornish's book important, writing: \"For one thing, at the K.u.k. Realschule in Linz, Wittgenstein met Hitler and may have inspired in him a hatred of Jews which led, ultimately, to the Holocaust. This, naturally enough, weighed heavily on Wittgenstein's conscience in his later years ... It is overwhelmingly probable that Hitler and Wittgenstein did meet, and with dire consequences for the history of the world.\"\n\nReviewing Goldstein's own book, Mary McGinn called it a sloppy and irresponsible argument: \"[O]ne is amazed at the sheer looseness of thought that allows him to assert that 'at certain points in \"Mein Kampf\" where Hitler seems to be raging against Jews in general it is the individual young Ludwig Wittgenstein whom he has in mind', and to suggest that Wittgenstein 'may have inspired … (the) hatred of Jews which led, ultimately, to the Holocaust'. It is exactly this sort of sloppy, irresponsible, 'plausible' style of thought that Wittgenstein's philosophy, by its careful attention to the particular and to not saying more or less than is warranted, is directed against.\"\n\nRay Monk, one of Wittgenstein's biographers, concentrates on the inconsistencies in Cornish's theory that Wittgenstein was the head of the Cambridge spy ring, asking why Cornish has apparently not bothered to verify any of his theories by checking the KGB archives. Ultimately, Monk says \"As I read \"The Jew of Linz\", I found myself wondering how on earth Cornish had confected so strange a piece of work. I found it by turns puzzling, funny, challenging and outrageously nutty... Cornish calls his book 'pioneer detective work', but I think it is really pioneer detective fiction.\"\n\nDaniel Johnson viewed \"The Jew of Linz\" as a \"revisionist tract masquerading as psycho-history\". He wrote, \"Cornish correctly identifies 'the twist of the investigation' as the thesis that 'Nazi metaphysics, as discernible in Hitler's writings... is nothing but Wittgenstein's theory of the mind modified so as to exclude the race of its inventor'. So the \"Jew of Linz\" was indirectly responsible, at least in part, for the Holocaust. Cornish tries to deflect the implications of his argument thus: 'Whatever 'the Jews' may have done, nothing humanly justifies what was done to them.' But he then offers 'a thought that might occur to a Hasidic Jew, and that is more fittingly a matter for Jewish, as opposed to gentile, reflection: the very engine that drove Hitler's acquisition of the magical powers that made his ascent and the Holocaust possible was the Wittgenstein Covenant violation'. At this point, the nonsensical shades into the downright sinister.\n\nSean French wrote in the \"New Statesman\": \"There is something heroic about this argument and it would be a good subject for a novel about the dangers of creating theories out of nothing. Vladimir Nabokov should have written it. It is not just that there are weak links in the theory. There are no links in the theory. No evidence that Hitler, in his final unhappy year, even knew a boy two years above him. If they did know each other, there is no evidence that he was the boy Hitler distrusted, no evidence that Hitler's remarks on snitching related to specific incidents at the Linz Realschule, no evidence that Wittgenstein informed on his fellow pupils.\" In the same journal, Roz Kaveney calls it \"a stupid and dishonest book\", and says \"[Cornish's] intention is to claim Wittgenstein for his own brand of contemplative mysticism, which he defines as the great insight that IndoEuropeans (or, as he unregenerately terms them, Aryans) brought to Hinduism and Buddhism.\"\n\nAntony Flew offers a mixed review: \"Mr Cornish contends that the reason why the government of the USSR treated Wittgenstein with such peculiar generosity was that he had been the recruiter of all the Cambridge spies. The question whether or not this hypothesis is true or false can be definitively settled only if and when the relevant Soviet archives are examined. But I am myself as confident as without such knock-down decisive verification it is possible to be that Mr Cornish is right. On the other hand, 'On the very first page of Part III, Mr Cornish explains that the essence of this doctrine was expressed by Emerson in his restatement of the original Aryan doctrine of consciousness: '… the act of seeing and the thing seen, the see-er and the spectacle, the subject and the object is one'. I confess, not very shamefacedly, that confronted with such doctrines I want to quote Groucho Marx: 'It appears absurd. But don't be misled. It is absurd.'\"\n\nGerman historian \"Michael Rissmann\" argues that Cornish overestimates Hitler's intellectual capacities and uses fraudulent talks Hermann Rauschning claims to have had with Hitler to prove Hitler's alleged occultist interest.\" In \"Philosophy Now\", John Mann argues that the contentions that so riled up the book's many critics were simply a clever ruse by Cornish designed to attract more readers. Mann writes: \"Cornish is clever enough to know if he wrote a book on his 'no ownership' theory of language it would not have a wide readership. If he says this 'no ownership' theory was taught by Wittgenstein, learned and twisted for his own ends by Hitler, and actually needs Cornish to explain it all in great detail for the rest of the book he has the book reviewed in every paper and even serialised in the Sunday Times. ... If you’re looking for a book which offers history, politics, magic and philosophy, try \"The Jew of Linz\".\"\n\n"}

In the United Kingdom 100 ml of 2.5% shampoo costs the NHS about 1.96 pounds.\n\nSelenium disulfide is sold as an antifungal agent in shampoos for the treatment of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis associated in the scalp with fungi of genus \"Malassezia\". In the United States, a 1% strength is available over-the-counter, and a 2.5% strength is also available with a prescription. In Canada, the 2.5% strength is available over-the-counter. At the 2.5% strength, selenium disulfide is also used on the body to treat Tinea versicolor, a type of fungal skin infection caused by a different species of \"Malassezia\". It has been suggested to be effective as a treatment for hyperkeratosis.\n\nSelenium disulfide can cause discoloration of the hair and alter the color of hair dyes. It may also discolor metallic jewellery.\n\nSelenium disulfide has a composition that approximates to SeS and is sometimes called selenium sulfide. However, as used in proprietary formulations, it is not a pure chemical compound but a mixture where the overall Se:S ratio is 1:2. The compounds are Se–S rings containing a variable number of S and Se atoms, SeS.\n\nMany selenium sulfides are known as indicated by Se-NMR spectroscopy.\n\nSelenium monosulfide, along with elemental selenium and sulfur, has been used in medicinal preparations in the past, causing confusion and contradiction as to exactly what form selenium is in any given topical preparation.\n\nIn the film Evolution selenium was mentioned as an active ingredient of Head & Shoulders. A group of academics, therefore, tried to use this brand of shampoo to stop an alien invasion after discovering that the alien life form was sensitive to selenium. In fact, the modern shampoo from this brand no longer contains selenium sulfide and instead zinc pyrithione is used as a dandruff-reducing component.\n\n\n"}

He subsequently became a pupil of Willem Willemz and Augusteyn of Delft, until Anthonie van Montfoort (Houbraken calls him \"Antony Blokland\"), who had seen and admired two of Mierevelt's early engravings, \"Christ and the Samaritan\" and \"Judith and Holofernes\", invited him to enter his school at Utrecht.\n\nHe registered as a member of the Guild of St. Luke in The Hague in 1625. Devoting himself first to still lifes, he eventually took up portraiture, in which he achieved such success that the many commissions entrusted to him necessitated the employment of numerous assistants, by whom hundreds of portraits were turned out in factory fashion. Today over 500 paintings are or have been attributed to him. The works that can with certainty be ascribed to his own brush are remarkable for their sincerity, severe drawing and harmonious color, but comparatively few of the two thousand or more portraits that bear his name are wholly his own handiwork. So great was his reputation that he was patronized by royalty in many countries and acquired great wealth. The king of Sweden and the count palatine of Neuburg presented him with golden chains; Albert VII, Archduke of Austria, at whose court he lived in Delft, gave him a pension; and Charles I vainly endeavoured to induce him to visit the English court.\n\nThough Mierevelt is chiefly known as a portrait painter, he also executed some mythological pieces of minor importance. Many of his portraits have been reproduced in line by the leading Dutch engravers of his time. He died at Delft.\n\nThe Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has the richest collection of Mierevelt's works, chief of them being the portraits of William, Philip William, Maurice, and Frederick Henry of Orange, and of the count palatine Frederick V. At the Mauritshuis in The Hague are the portraits of four princes of the house of Orange, of Frederick V as king of Bohemia, and of Louise de Coligny as a widow. Other portraits by him are at nearly all the leading continental galleries, notably at Brunswick (3), Gotha (2), Schwerin (3), Munich (2), Paris (Louvre, 3), Dresden (4), Berlin (2), and Darmstadt (3). The town hall of Delft also has numerous examples of his work.\n\nMany of his pupils and assistants rose to fame. The most gifted of them were Paulus Moreelse, Jan Antonisz. van Ravesteyn, Daniel Mijtens, Anthonie Palamedesz, Johan van Nes, and Hendrick Cornelisz. van Vliet. His sons Pieter (1596–1623) and Jan (died 1633), and his son-in-law Jacob Delff, probably painted many of the pictures which go under his name. His portrait was painted by Anthony van Dyck and engraved by Jacob Delff.\n\nAttribution:\n\n"}
{"id": "2311336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311336", "title": "Mode (user interface)", "text": "Mode (user interface)\n\nIn user interface design, a mode is a distinct setting within a computer program or any physical machine interface, in which the same user input will produce perceived results different from those that it would in other settings. Modal interface components include the Caps lock and Insert keys on the standard computer keyboard, both of which typically put the user's typing into a different mode after being pressed, then return it to the regular mode after being re-pressed.\n\nAn interface that uses no modes is known as a \"modeless\" interface. Modeless interfaces avoid \"mode errors\", in which the user performs an action appropriate to one mode while in another mode, by making it impossible for the user to commit them.\n\nIn his book \"The Humane Interface\", Jef Raskin defines modality as follows:\n\n\"An human-machine interface is modal with respect to a given gesture\nwhen (1) the current state of the interface is not the user's locus of\nattention and (2) the interface will execute one among several\ndifferent responses to the gesture, depending on the system's current\nstate.\" (Page 42).\nIn Raskin's sense and according to his definition, an interface is not modal as long as the user is fully aware of its current state. Raskin refers to this as \"locus of attention\" (from the Latin word \"locus\" meaning \"place\" or \"location\"). Typically a user is aware of a system state if the state change was purposefully initiated by the user, or if the system gives some strong signals to notify the user of the state change in the place where interaction occurs. If the user's locus of attention changes to a different area, the state of the interface may then represent a mode since the user is no longer aware of it.\n\nLarry Tesler defined modes as \"a state of the user interface that lasts for a period of time, is not associated with any particular object, and has no role other than to place an interpretation on operator input.\" \n\nSeveral examples of software have been described as \"modal\" or using interface modes:\n\nLarry Tesler at PARC devised insights for a modeless word processor from the feedback gathered from a user test with newly-hired Sylvia Adams, where she was asked to ad lib some gestures to correct proofreading marks on the digital text. This test convinced Tesler's manager Bill English of the problems with their previous modal interface.\n\nModes are often frowned upon in interface design because they are likely to produce \"mode errors\" when the user forgets what state the interface is in, performs an action that is appropriate to a different mode, and gets an unexpected and undesired response. A mode error can be quite startling and disorienting as the user copes with the sudden violation of his or her user expectations.\n\nProblems occur if a change in the system state happens unnoticed (initiated by the system, or by another person, such as the user who was previously using the machine), or if after some time the user forgets about the state change. Another typical problem is a sudden change of state that interrupts a user's activity, such as focus stealing. In such a situation it can easily happen that the user does some operations with the old state in mind, while the brain has not yet fully processed the signals indicating the state change.\n\nA very frustrating type of modality is created by a mode where the user does not find a way out, in other words, where they cannot find how to restore the previous system state.\n\n\n\nModes are intended to grab the user's full attention and to cause them to acknowledge the content present in them, in particular when critical confirmation from the user is required. This later use is criticised as ineffective for its intended use (protection against errors in destructive actions) due to habituation. Actually making the action reversible (providing an \"undo\" option) is recommended instead. Though modes can be successful in particular usages to restrict dangerous or undesired operations, especially when the mode is actively maintained by a user as a \"quasimode\".\n\nModes are sometimes used to represent information pertinent to the task that doesn’t fit well into the main visual flow. Modes can also work as well-understood conventions, such as painting tools.\n\nModal proponents may argue that many common activities are modal and users adapt to them. An example of modal interaction is that of driving motor vehicles. A driver may be surprised when pressing the acceleration pedal does not accelerate the vehicle in the forward direction, most likely because the vehicle has been placed in an operating mode like park, neutral, or reverse. Modal interfaces require training and experience to avoid mode errors like these.\n\nInterface expert Jef Raskin came out strongly against modes, writing, \"Modes are a significant source of errors, confusion, unnecessary restrictions, and complexity in interfaces.\" Later he notes, \" 'It is no accident that swearing is denoted by #&%!#$&,' writes my colleague, Dr. James Winter; it is 'what a typewriter used to do when you typed numbers when the Caps Lock was engaged'.\" Raskin dedicated his book \"The Humane Interface\" to describe the principles of a modeless interface for computers. Those principles were implemented in the Canon Cat and Archy systems.\n\nSome interface designers have recently taken steps to make modal windows more obvious and user friendly by darkening the background behind the window or allowing any mouse click outside of the modal window to force the window to close – a design called a Lightbox – thus alleviating the risk of modal errors. Jakob Nielsen states as an advantage of modal dialogs that it improves user awareness. \"When something does need fixing, it's better to make sure that the user knows about it.\" For this goal, the Lightbox design provides strong visual contrast of the dialog over the rest of the visuals. However, while such a method may reduce the risk of inadvertent wrong interactions, it does not solve the problem that the modal window blocks use of the application's normal features and so prevents the user from taking any action to fix the difficulty, or even from scrolling the screen to bring into view information which they need to correctly choose from the options the modal window presents, and it does nothing to alleviate the user's frustration at having blundered into a dead end from which they cannot escape without some more or less destructive consequence.\n\nLarry Tesler, of Xerox PARC and Apple Computer, disliked modes sufficiently to get a personalized license plate for his car that read: \"NO MODES\". He used this plate on various cars from the early 1980s until his death in 2020. Along with others, he also used the phrase \"Don't Mode Me In\" for years as a rallying cry to eliminate or reduce modes.\n\nBruce Wyman, the designer of a multi-touch table for a Denver Art Museum art exhibition argues that interfaces for several simultaneous users must be modeless, in order to avoid bringing any single user into focus.\n\nAlternatives to modes such as the undo command and the recycle bin are recommended when possible. HCI researcher Donald Norman argues that the best way to avoid mode errors, in addition to clear indications of state, is helping the users to construct an accurate mental model of the system which will allow them to predict the mode accurately.\n\nThis is demonstrated, for example, by some stop signs at road intersections. A driver may be conditioned by a four-way stop sign near his or her home to assume that similar intersections will also be four way stops. If it happens to be only two way, the driver could proceed through if he or she sees no other cars. Especially if there is an obstructed view, a car could come though and hit the first car broadside. An improved design alleviates the problem by including a small diagram showing which of the directions have a stop sign and which don't, thus improving the situational awareness of drivers.\n\nModal controls are best placed where the focus is in the task flow. For example, a modal window can be placed next to the graphical control element that triggers its activation. Modal controls can be disruptive, so efforts should be made to reduce their capacity to block user work. After completing the task for which the mode was activated, or after a cancel action such as the Escape key, returning to the previous state when a mode is dismissed will reduce the negative impact.\n\nIn the book \"The Humane Interface\", Jef Raskin championed what he termed \"quasimodes\", which are modes that are kept in place only through some constant action on the part of the user; such modes are also called \"spring-loaded modes\". The term \"quasimode\" is a composite of the Latin prefix \"quasi-\" (which means \"almost\", \"to some degree\") and the English word \"mode\".\n\nModifier keys on the keyboard, such as the Shift key, the Alt key and the Control key, are all examples of a quasimodal interface.\n\nThe application enters into that mode as long as the user is performing a conscious action, like pressing a key and keeping it pressed while invoking a command. If the sustaining action is stopped without executing a command, the application returns to a neutral status.\n\nThe purported benefit of this technique is that the user doesn't have to remember the current state of the application when invoking a command: the same action will always produce the same perceived result. An interface that uses quasimodes only and has no full modes is still modeless according to Raskin's definition.\n\nThe StickyKeys feature turns a quasimode into a mode by serializing keystrokes of modifier keys with normal keys, so that they don't have to be pressed simultaneously. In this case the increased possibility of a mode error is largely compensated for by the improved accessibility for users with physical disabilities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2311356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311356", "title": "City of Burnside", "text": "City of Burnside\n\nThe City of Burnside is a local government area in the South Australian city of Adelaide stretching from the Adelaide Parklands into the Adelaide foothills with an area of . It was founded in August 1856 as the District Council of Burnside, the name of a property of an early settler, and was classed as a city in 1943. The LGA is bounded by Adelaide, Adelaide Hills Council, Campbelltown, Mitcham, Norwood Payneham and St Peters and Unley.\n\nA primarily residential upper middle class area, Burnside has little to no industrial activity and a small commercial sector. Over of its area is dedicated to Parks and Reserves, the result being one of the greenest areas in Adelaide.\n\nIt was one of the first areas outside of Adelaide to be settled, with the early villages of Magill, Burnside, Beaumont and Glen Osmond now inner suburbs. At the 2006 census, the City had a SEIFA score of 1108 (96th percentile), which was the highest figure for any local government area in South Australia — individual CCD scores ranged from 909 in eastern Glenside to 1194 in Stonyfell.\n\nBurnside was inhabited by the Kaurna Indigenous people prior to European Settlement, with the natives living around the creeks of the River Torrens during the summer months and living in the Adelaide Hills during the wintertime. The area was first settled in 1839 by Peter Anderson, a Scots migrant, who named it Burnside after his property's location adjacent to Second Creek (in Scots, 'Burn' means creek or stream). The Village of Burnside was established shortly thereafter and the District Council of Burnside was gazetted in 1856, being separated from the larger East Torrens Council. The council's first chairman was Dr. C. R. Penfold of Penfolds Wines fame. Beaumont House, a historic structure, was constructed for the first bishop of Adelaide, Augustus Short, during 1851. Wineries, mining and olive groves were the mainstay of an early Burnside economy; Glen Osmond boasted substantial mineral deposits and world-class vineyards were established at Magill. The first council chamber was designed by chairman George Soward and built in 1869 by Thomas Hill and William Yateman. The present Council Chambers were built in 1927/8 in Tusmore, with the council becoming a municipality in 1935. With strong growth and development throughout the region, Burnside was then proclaimed a city in 1943. The 1960s' brought to Burnside a community library and a swimming centre, both were further expanded and upgraded between 1997 and 2001.\n\nBurnside has an area of and is located from the east to the south-east of the Adelaide city centre and parklands, extending east to the Cleland Conservation Park in the Mount Lofty Ranges. Two creeks of the River Torrens run through a gradually sloping plain from the ranges; there is much variation in land use and topography.\n\nBefore European Settlement in South Australia, much of the Adelaide Plains were swamps and woodland. In what became Burnside, plains leading out to Unley hosted the large Black Forest of Grey Box woodland. To the north and the floodplains of First and Second Creeks, there were Blue Gums and River Red Gums. Nearer to the foothills, in Mount Osmond and Waterfall Gully, a more diverse range of plant species existed, however Manna Gums and Blue Gums were predominant. With colonisation, much of the native foliage was cut down to enable crops and grazing. Market Gardens in the Adelaide Hills lowered the amount of water flowing down the creeks and some of the Hills Face was used for quarrying. Early crops included olives, grapes for winemaking, wheat and barley. Over the years agriculture greatly declined and only vineyards survive today in Magill and Waterfall Gully.\n\nWith new suburbs being gazetted in the 20th century, the Burnside Council undertook ambitious tree-planting, beautification and conservation schemes to slow and then reverse the negative impact on the natural environment. 190 hectares of the council area is held in reserves and parks and some 35,000 trees line the streets. A 'Second Generation Tree Planting Program' has been underway since 1993. Notable parks and reserves include Chambers Gully, Langman Reserve and Hazelwood Park.\n\nThe Burnside city council is divided into the following wards:\n\nBurnside library is the only public library in the city of Burnside. It is adjacent to the Council offices and is part of the civic centre. The library is open seven days a week, from 9.30am-6pm on weekdays, except Thursday when it closes at 9pm, and on the weekend from 10am-4pm on Saturday and 2pm-5pm on Sunday.\n\nFor State Government Burnside is part of the Electoral Districts of Adelaide, Bragg, Morialta, Hartley, Heysen, Norwood and Unley. Bragg takes in most of the city; it is the strongest Liberal Party district in the Adelaide Metropolitan Area and the third strongest in the state. Liberal strength is strongest in the wealthy hills suburbs to the south-east around Beaumont and weakest around Norwood in the north where the Labor Party dominates. Before their catastrophic collapse in recent years, the Democrats polled impressive results in the western near-city suburbs. The Greens gained much of the previous Democrats vote in recent elections. Bragg has been held by Vickie Chapman, Shadow Attorney-General of the State Liberal Party, since 2002.\n\nBurnside forms the southern part of the Federal Division of Sturt, which takes in much of Adelaide's eastern suburbs, stretching from Paradise to Glen Osmond. Up until the 2007 Federal Election, it was a safe Liberal seat for over thirty years. At the election, on a two-party preferred basis, the Liberal Party gained 50.94% of the vote and the Labor Party 49.06%, a difference of only 1,712 votes. The current member is Christopher Pyne, who has held the seat for the Liberal Party since 1993 and has been Minister for Education and Leader of the House in the Abbott Government since 18 September 2013.\n\nAn inquiry was launched in 2009 by then state Local Government Minister Gail Gago into allegations of \"harassment, bullying and misconduct\" by then members of the City Council. After about $200,000 of expenditure by the council and $1.3 million by the state government, legal action by former councilors prevented the release of the report. A Supreme Court ruling on 27 May 2011, found that the report could be partially released, after material related to parts of the terms of reference deemed inappropriate was redacted.\n\nThe population of the City of Burnside, at the time of the 2001 census, was 40,398. This was an increase of 1,308 from the 1996 census. 53.3% of the population is female and 73.6% were born in Australia. Burnside is characterised by what is called an 'urban mix' by demographers; it contains a diverse range of age, family and household types. There are 16,835 households in Burnside, 10,917 of these are self-described families. 45% of families represent a couple with children, 11.% represent a sole-parent family and 43.1% are couples without children (or whose children have left home). The large amount of couples without children (5.6% higher than the Adelaide average) owes to the sizeable elderly population. Almost a quarter (23.7%) of the population is aged 60 or over, almost a third (29.9%) is 24 or younger; mature adults are the largest population group at 46.4%. This would indicate a structure primarily of mature families and retirees, young adults are hugely unrepresented (although this is not unique to Burnside, this phenomenon is common throughout the majority of the Adelaide region); the 18-24 age group suffered a loss of 330 people between 1996 and 2001.\n\n26.3% of the population was born abroad, less than the Adelaide average. 9% of the population came from English-speaking countries, while 14.3% did not. In decreasing order, the foreign-born population was from the United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, China and South Africa. These patterns are broadly in-line with that of Australia as a whole; they reflect traditional immigration from Commonwealth countries such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand, later waves of Mediterranean migrants and more recent arrivals from Asia.\n\nReligious adherence in Burnside is higher than the Adelaide and Australian average, standing at 71.7%. Of this adherence, 67.6% represents traditional Christian denominations. Common across Australia and many developed countries, there has been a substantial decline in religiosity; this is evident but less marked in Burnside; 17.7% of residents profess no religious belief (atheism, agnosticism, etc.). The ten strongest religions/denominations in decreasing order are: Catholic, Anglican, Uniting, Orthodox, Lutheran, Baptist, Buddhism, Presbyterian, Judaism and Hinduism. Catholicism is unique for its marked increase (575 persons) in believers between 1996 and 2001, most other religions' numbers remained stable or saw a slight decrease.\n\nBurnside has no manufacturing industries and a small amount of agricultural plots still exist in the form of vineyards. It does however contain a sizeable amount of service industry; high-technology and commercial offices line the streets opposite the Adelaide park lands.\n\nBurnside workers are employed in the Industries of Education, Health and Community Services (27%); Finance, insurance and business services (22.5%); wholesale and retail trade (16%); recreation and personal services (11.2%) and manufacturing (7.7%). In these industries they are employed as: Professionals (35.5%); clerks, salespersons and service (26.2%); Associate Professionals (13.7%); Managers and Administrators (12.4%) and tradepersons (4.8%).\n\nBurnside has two public high schools, Glenunga International High School and the Magill campus of the Norwood Morialta High School, in its boundaries. Glenunga High remains at capacity through student enrolment from overseas and outside the local area. Its beginnings can be traced back to 1898; it was first established as the South Australian School of Mines and Industries on North Terrace, its original buildings there are now part of the University of Adelaide campus. It changed name to Adelaide Technical High School in 1918. With the move to its current location at Glenunga in 1963 the name was eventually changed to Glenunga High School a decade later. The school attained International Baccalaureate accreditation in 1990 and 'International' was added to its title. Marryatville High School is also on the boundaries of Burnside and draws most of its students from Burnside. There are also Burnside Primary School and Linden Park Primary School, both years Rec-7 public schools.\n\nThere is an annual Battle of the Bands held at Burnside Town Hall.\n\nThe Burnside Symphony Orchestra is based in the council area, and performs up to 4 concerts annually in the Burnside Ballroom at the Town Hall.\n\nThe Burnside Town Hall is identified as one of South Australia's 120 most significant 20th-century buildings.\n\nThe Burnside War Memorial Hospital is the only community hospital in Burnside. Otto Georg Ludwig van Rieben offered his Attunga property for use as a community hospital free of charge in 1944. The Council had first suggested building a community hospital in August 1943 as part of its Post-War Reconstruction and Development Committee; it was to cost no more than 100,000 pounds and be a memorial to honour Burnside's war dead. In April 1949 the first conversion of van Rieben's home was complete and the hospital was caring for 21 patients. The hospital closed for a month in 1956 and when it reopened was given its present name: The Burnside War Memorial Hospital. The hospital is not-for-profit and reinvests all surplus into upgrading facilities, equipment and services.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Hospital on the corner of Fullarton Road and Grant Avenue in Rose Park opened in 1902 with a grant of 2,550 pounds. It was originally known as \"The Queen's Home\" as it opened on the birth day of Queen Victoria, (24 May). It was renamed in 1939 to the \"Queen Victoria Maternity Hospital\" and under the \"Hospital Benefits Act of 1946\" became a public hospital. It operated until 1995 when it was amalgamated with the Women's and Children's Hospital and the original building was sold and converted into apartments. Over 250,000 South Australians began their lives at the hospital.\n\nThe area was originally served by horse-drawn buses and trolleys but it was electric trams and trolley buses that led to the development of Burnside as a suburban residential area.\n\nBurnside is located at a transport crossroads for national freight movements. Freight traffic from Victoria diverges down Glen Osmond and Portrush Roads upon entering the metropolitan area via the South Eastern Freeway (formerly Mount Barker Road). Both roads carry an almost equal amount of freight traffic, Glen Osmond leads to the airport and Outer Harbor while Portrush Road connects to the northern industrial suburbs, the state's north, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. In addition, they act as major commuter arteries for the Adelaide Hills and form the eastern part of Adelaide's outer bypass route. The current South Eastern Freeway was completed in 1999 and Portrush Road saw an extensive upgrade throughout 2003–2004.\n\nOther major commuter roads include Kensington, Magill and Greenhill Roads, which run east-west. Glynburn and Fullarton Roads provide secondary north-south corridors, the former runs close to the foothills and alleviates congestion on Portrush while the latter forms part of Adelaide's inner bypass route. Maintenance of the extensive road network is a State Government responsibility; the Federal Government provides funding for nationally important AusLink routes. Council provides recommendations to projects and participates in the upkeep of the curbs, frontage, footpaths and minor signage.\n\nBurnside residents rely overwhelmingly on cars as a means to travel to work; 64.3% drive their own vehicle and 5.6% are a regular passenger in one. 5.8% use public transport, in the form of Adelaide Metro buses, for their commute; 1.2% bicycle and 2.3% walk. Non-vehicular travel is on the rise, with usage higher than the Adelaide average and an increase in persons doing so between 1996 and 2001. 38% of Burnside households own one vehicle, 26.8% own two and 12.3% own three vehicles or more. Burnside and suburbs east of the city were served by an excellent tramway system that was shut down in the 1950s.\nWith the advent of widespread automobile travel in the mid-20th century there was a tendency for motorists to use local roads in suburbs adjacent to the CBD for their commute home. 'Rat trails' of cars sneaked through narrow side-streets, presenting traffic bottlenecks. This was a particular problem for some western Burnside suburbs because of their location. Various traffic control methods were put in place (closing streets, speed bumps, lowered speed limits, roundabouts) to counter these problems; this forced the re-routing of traffic onto major thoroughfares.\n\nBurnside is connected to the Adelaide water, power and gas mains. Until recently, many of the foothills suburbs did not have access to sewage systems and used septic tanks. This had been rectified in the last decade in a partnership between SA Water and the Burnside Council.\n\nSA Power Networks is the Electricity Distributor, with approximately 10 retailers. Burnside derives its electricity via the Adelaide grid from a gas-fired plant at Torrens Island. Burnside's water supply is gained from the Adelaide area reservoirs: Mount Bold, Happy Valley, Myponga, Millbrook, Hope Valley, Little Para and South Para. Further water demands result in the pumping of water from the River Murray. The provider of water services is by the government-owned SA Water. In early times, Burnside's creeks contributed to Adelaide's water supply.

These employ a control method called UcD, invented by Bruno Putzeys and patented by Philips. \n\nThe company was formed in 1996. Hypex began producing the UcD in the early 2000s, after Phillips declined to use Putzeys' technology in its own product range. By 2004, the company had produced a 180-watt Class-D amplifier on a board with around 0.02% total harmonic distortion. Putzeys joined Hyped full-time in 2005, and began working on UcD's follow-up, the NCore, with an improved reduction in distortion with 92% efficiency.\n\nHypex modules can be found in some high-end audio products, including NAD Electronics (who produce customised versions of the original Hypex UcD) or in musical instrument amplifiers. The TEAC AX-505 amplifier is driven by a Hypex Class D nCore, as is the NAD Master Series M10 streaming amplifier.\n\nThe NCore 400 is available in kit form, that allows the module to be used in lower-end equipment. It supports a signal to noise ratio of 125 decibels and a switching speed of 470-530 kilohertz.\n\nThe company has its own production facility based in Malaysia.

It was marketed as a passenger car for consumers, as opposed to the similar Taxi, which was aimed at fleet buyers.\n\nMarathons were produced in both four-door sedan and four-door station wagon forms, and the rare eight-door, 12-seater \"Aerobus\" wagon.\n\nThe Marathon was introduced in September 1960 for the 1961 model year, alongside, and later superseding, the Checker Superba Custom and differing from the Superba with its better interior appointments. Originally, it retained the Superba's A10 body code, whereas A9 was the code used for taxis. The exterior of the Marathon had a full-width egg-crate grille, differing from the Superba's narrower grille and inboard parking lights. After a minor facelift for 1963, chassis codes changed to A11 for taxis and A12 for passenger versions. Also in 1963, the Marathon Town Custom, a limousine version on a longer (129 versus 120 in) wheelbase appeared. This version, which seated eight, received the A19E chassis code. A few years later, this was changed to A12E.\n\nWith the exception of United States government-mandated 5 mph bumpers in 1974 and ongoing mechanical changes, the Marathon remained virtually unchanged during its 21-year production run. However, Checker did comply with all safety and emissions requirements while in production. Some of these changes help in identifying the year of a Checker, and included:\n\n\nThe final Marathon was manufactured in 1982, when Checker exited the automobile manufacturing business. The company continued operations for an additional 27 years producing body stampings for General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, until January 2009, when it entered bankruptcy liquidation as a result of the downturn in the USA auto industry.\n\nNotably, the Marathon's front suspension A-frames interchange with a 1956 Ford. The engines used were originally Continental-built L-head inline-sixes (OHV units for the wagons), but these were exchanged for Chevrolet sixes and small-block V8s for the 1965 model year. These continued to change as Chevrolet introduced modifications, peaking with the 1969 L-48 350 V8 which produced (gross). In 1969, a Perkins 4.236 L diesel nonturbo engine was available as an option for all models, but for only one year. By 1973, power for the 350 had decreased to and in 1975 catalytic converters were introduced. For 1980, the engine lineup was changed entirely, with a 3.8-litre V6 replacing the old inline unit, and a smaller 267 ci (4.4 L) standard V8. The big news was the Oldsmobile LF9 engine, a diesel V8.\n\nChecker did not have a nationwide dealer network and sold most of its production for fleet service. Apart from taxicab use, Marathons were also bought by police departments, most notably in Kalamazoo, where Checker had its factory. In the late 1960s and into the early 1970s, some black SCV-plated (\"Stato Città del Vaticano\" - Vatican City) A12 Marathons were used to accommodate Pope Paul VI's entourage in motorcades. \n\nFor decades, Checker was the taxicab of choice for New York City and many other American cities. The size of the car (seating many passengers), the robust construction, the lack of yearly changes to the styling (Especially the 1958 and later models, simplifying parts management), and the bolt-on rear quarter panels all contributed to the Marathon's ubiquity on the streets of Manhattan. For example, virtually any film set in New York City in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s will show a Checker Marathon. A knowledgeable Checker viewer, however, will note that many movies set in the 1950s and 1960s use Checker cabs built in the 1970s and early 1980s, since the bodies were virtually the same, and due to the lack of usable early specimens. Also, in works depicting the Soviet Union or East Bloc countries, such as the film \"Gorky Park\" and the original \"\" television series, Checker Marathons were used to depict Soviet-made Chaika 13 (GAZ 13) automobiles.\n\n"}

These messages admitted he had harvested emails from \"various publicly available sources and other marketing promotions\", but included instructions for recipients to unsubscribe from the list.\n\nT3 Direct was blacklisted along with the company in June 2002 by the Spam Prevention Early Warning System (SPEWS), along with its ISP, Swiftel (now People Telecom). Swiftel suspended T3 Direct's online access for this, and also violation of its terms of service. T3 Direct was left with A$4,578 in charges outstanding to Swiftel. However, Mansfield insisted that it was the other arm of his business, concerned with web design and the management of opt-in databases, which suffered as a result.\n\nIn July of the same year, Mansfield began legal action against Perth technician and anti-spam campaigner Joey McNicol. After receiving spam from Mansfield and discovering that the unsubscribe option did not work, and that contact details in the messages were fake, McNicol had set up a website publishing the details of T3 Direct and other Mansfield companies, as well as publishing these details in newsgroups. Mansfield accused McNicol of sending his company's IP address to SPEWS, prompting the blacklisting, but lost the case as he was unable to prove McNicol had actually contacted SPEWS, and in any case the action was not ruled to be illegal. Although Mansfield's company was ordered to pay McNicol's costs in the action, Mansfield shut down that company without paying those costs and continued business using a new company. McNicol's legal fees were in part paid by donations.\n\nIn August 2013, Mansfield was fined NZ$95,000 in New Zealand under the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007 for the sending of unsolicited email communications. The case was brought by the Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand) after it had received 53 complaints relating to unsolicited email from Mansfield and his entities between April and September 2010.\n\nIn 2015 Mansfield has resumed spamming, this time using a not for profit charity \"The Jindalee Foundation\" in an attempt to skirt anti-spam laws.\n\nIn June 2005 the then Australian Communications Authority (ACA) (Now known as the Australian Communications & Media Authority – ACMA) brought proceedings against Mansfield and his new company, Clarity1 under the recently passed Spam Act 2003 where ACMA alleged that they were involved in the sending of 56 million spam emails during 2004. He however insisted that sending commercial emails was his \"right\", but claimed he had not harvested any new email addresses since the Spam Act came into force, arguing that because he had started spamming the recipients before the Spam Act and the recipients had not unsubscribed, he could infer consent (an argument that did not find favour with the Court). He also stated that telephone operators at his company had been subjected to abuse by irate callers, but promised that unsubscribe requests were handled \"within minutes\". He defended his campaign, citing 20,000 attendees at his business seminars.\n\nACMA's complaint in this matter was upheld in the Australia Federal Court on 13 April 2006. The Court imposed a penalty of A$4.5 million on Clarity1, and A$1 million on Wayne Mansfield, on 27 October 2006.\n\nIn April 2009, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) disqualified Mansfield from managing corporations for four years following their investigation into his role in two failed companies. These companies were Clarity1 Pty Ltd, which was at the centre of the spam case, and The Which Company Pty Ltd. \"ASIC found that the companies had failed with substantial statutory debts accrued over a substantial period and that Mr Mansfield's management and involvement in the affairs of Clarity1 Pty Ltd and Which Co Pty Ltd did not meet the standards required of a person in his position.\"\n\n"}

Huangshan means \"Yellow Mountain\" in Chinese and the city is named after the famously scenic Yellow Mountains which cover much of the city's vast geographic expanse. The prefectural city of Huangshan includes three urban districts and four counties. The urban center of Huangshan was originally the city of Tunxi and is now called Tunxi District. Locals still call the city Tunxi to distinguish urban core from other parts of Huangshan.\nHuangshan occupies the southernmost part of Anhui. It is bordered by Chizhou to the northwest, Xuancheng to the northeast, Jiangxi Province to the southwest and Zhejiang Province to the southeast. Huangshan's history dates back to the time of the First Emperor. The city's current jurisdiction covers much of the historical and cultural region of Huizhou (), which together with Anqing formed the name of Anhui Province. Huangshan is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Mount Huangshan and Hongcun and Xidi, the ancient villages of Southern Anhui. It is a leading tourist destination in China.\n\nThe prefecture-level city of Huangshan administers 7 county-level divisions, including 3 districts and 4 counties.\n\n\nThese are further divided into 145 township-level divisions, including 42 towns, 100 townships and 3 subdistricts.\n\nLower elevations of Huangshan City have a humid subtropical climate (Köppen \"Cfa\"), with short, cool winters and long, very hot and humid summers. At the central Tunxi District, the monthly mean temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . Precipitation is concentrated in spring and the earlier part of summer, and, at annually, is very high for the province, and more than double than the normal annual precipitation in northern parts of the province.\n\nKeemun tea is produced in Qimen County, and the tea is named for the county. Mao feng, a green tea, is produced in neighboring counties. Tourism, centered on Mount Huang and including other scenic and historic sites (such as Xidi and Hongcun), is an important part of the Huangshan economy.\n\nDue to rugged terrain, Huangshan was traditionally a secluded region. The Xinan River provided an outlet to the east. Winding, narrow roads through Huang Mountains made trips to Xuancheng, Wuhu, Guichi and the Yangtze River slow and arduous. In recent decades, improvements to the transportation infrastructure have made the city and its surrounding tourist attractions more accessible.\n\nThe Huangshan Tunxi International Airport, also referred to as the Tunxi Airport, is located in Tunxi District and is known by the IATA abbreviation TXN. The airport was built in 1958 and was expanded in 2000. It offers daily flights to Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Guangzhou, and weekly flights to Chengdu, Chongqing, Xiamen, and Shenzhen.\n\nHuangshan City is currently served by only one railway line, the Anhui–Jiangxi Railway, which was completed in 1982 and has stations in Jixi County, She County, Tunxi District, Xiuning County, and Qimen County. From the main Huangshan City Railway Station in Tunxi, direct train service is available to Nanjing, Shanghai, Bengbu, Huaibei, Qingdao and Beijing among other cities the north, and points to the south including Jingdezhen, Yingtan, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Kunming.\n\nHuangshan is accessible via high-speed rail through the Hefei–Fuzhou high-speed railway and the Hangzhou–Huangshan intercity railway.\n\nHuangshan is now a highway junction city. The Huizhou-Hangzhou Expressway runs east to Hangzhou. The Hefei-Tongling-Huangshan Expressway heads north to Tongling on the Yangtze River and then to Hefei, the Anhui provincial capital. The Huangshan-Taling-Taolin Expressway extends southwest to Wuyuan in Jiangxi Province. The Huangshan-Quzhou-Nanping Expressway, currently under construction, will run southeast through Zhejiang Province to Nanping in Fujian Province. Until the expressways were built in the first decade of the 21st century, Huangshan's main roads were National Route G205 and Provincial Route S326, which follow the Anhui-Zhejiang Railway.\n\nIn the Ming dynasty, (; 1518–1595), a native of the Huizhou, Anhui, village of Qingxi wrote the opera \"Mulian Rescues His Mother\" According to local legend, Zheng was blind when he wrote the opera and was restored to full sight by a grateful Guanyin (the legend also has it that when Zheng later wrote a love story he went blind again). \n\nIn 2011, Local authorities promoted performance of the Ming dynasty play \"Mulian Rescues His Mother\" as a tourist attraction.\n\nIn early 2008, the BBC broadcast a series of 5 documentaries on life for schoolchildren in China, called \"Chinese School\".

{"id": "2311399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311399", "title": "Marn Grook", "text": "Marn Grook\n\nMarn Grook or marngrook, from the Woiwurung language for \"ball\" or \"game\", is a collective name given the traditional Indigenous Australian football game played at gatherings and celebrations of sometimes more than 100 players.\n\nMarn Grook featured punt kicking and catching a stuffed ball. It involved large numbers of players, and games were played over an extremely large area. The game was subject to strict behavioural protocols and for instance all players had to be matched for size, gender and skin group relationship. However, to observers the game appeared to lack a team objective, having no real rules, or scoring. A winner could only be declared if one of the sides agreed that the other side had played better. Individual players who consistently exhibited outstanding skills, such as leaping high over others to catch the ball, were often praised, but proficiency in the sport gave them no tribal influence.\n\nAnecdotal evidence supports such games being played all over south-eastern Australia, including the Djabwurrung and Jardwadjali people and other tribes in the Wimmera, Mallee and Millewa regions of western Victoria (However, according to some accounts, the range extended to the Wurundjeri in the Yarra Valley, the Gunai people of Gippsland, and the Riverina in south-western New South Wales. The Warlpiri tribe of Central Australia played a very similar kicking and catching game with a possum skin ball, and the game was known as \"pultja\".\nThe earliest accounts emerged decades after the European settlement of Australia, mostly from the colonial Victorian explorers and settlers. The earliest anecdotal account was in 1841, a decade prior to the Victorian gold rush. Although the consensus among historians is that Marn Grook existed before European arrival, it is not clear how long the game had been played in Victoria or elsewhere on the Australian continent.\nSome historians claim that Marn Grook had a role in the formation of Australian rules football, which originated in Melbourne in 1858 and was codified the following year by members of the Melbourne Football Club. This connection has become culturally important to many Indigenous Australians, including celebrities and professional footballers from communities in which Australian rules football is highly popular.\n\nRobert Brough Smyth, in an 1878 book, \"The Aborigines of Victoria\", quoted William Thomas, a Protector of Aborigines in Victoria, who stated that in about 1841 he had witnessed Wurundjeri Aborigines east of Melbourne playing the game. \n\nThe game was a favourite of the Wurundjeri-willam clan and the two teams were sometimes based on the traditional totemic moieties of Bunjil (eagle) and Waang (crow). Robert Brough-Smyth saw the game played at Coranderrk Mission Station, where ngurungaeta (elder) William Barak discouraged the playing of imported games like cricket and encouraged the traditional native game of marn grook.\n\nAn 1857 sketch found in 2007 describes an observation by Victorian scientist William Blandowski, of the Latjilatji people playing a football game near Merbein, on his expedition to the junction of the Murray and Darling Rivers. The Australian Sports Commission considers this sketch to be depicting the game of Woggabaliri.\nThe image is inscribed:\n\nHistorian Greg de Moore comments:\n\nIn 1889, anthropologist Alfred Howitt, wrote that the game was played between large groups on a totemic basis — the white cockatoos versus the black cockatoos, for example, which accorded with their skin system. Acclaim and recognition went to the players who could leap or kick the highest. Howitt wrote:\nThis game of ball-playing was also practised among the Kurnai, the Wolgal (Tumut river people), the Wotjoballuk as well as by the Woiworung, and was probably known to most tribes of south-eastern Australia. The Kurnai made the ball from the scrotum of an \"old man kangaroo\", the Woiworung made it of tightly rolled up pieces of possum skin. It was called by them \"mangurt\". In this tribe the two exogamous divisions, Bunjil and Waa, played on opposite sides. The Wotjoballuk also played this game, with Krokitch on one side and Gamutch on the other. The mangurt was sent as a token of friendship from one to another.\nSince the 1980s, some commentators, including Martin Flanagan, Jim Poulter and Col Hutchinson postulated that Australian rules football pioneer Tom Wills could have been inspired by Marn Grook.\n\nThe theory hinges on evidence which is circumstantial and anecdotal. Tom Wills was raised in Victoria's Western District. As the only white child in the district, it is said that he was fluent in the languages of the Djab wurrung and frequently played with local Aboriginal children on his father's property, \"Lexington\", outside modern-day Moyston. This story has been passed down through the generations of his family.\n\nCol Hutchison, former historian for the AFL, wrote in support of the theory postulated by Flanagan, and his account appears on an official AFL memorial to Tom Wills in Moyston, erected in 1998.\nSports historian Gillian Hibbins—who researched the origins of Australian rules football for the Australian Football League's official account of the game's history as part of its 150th anniversary celebrations—sternly rejects the theory, stating that while Marn Grook was \"definitely\" played around Port Fairy and throughout the Melbourne area, there is no evidence that the game was played north of the Grampians or by the Djabwurrung people, and the claim that Wills observed and possibly played the game is improbable:\n\nHibbin's account was widely publicised causing significant controversy and offending prominent Indigenous footballers who openly criticised the publication. \n\nJames Dawson, in his 1881 book titled \"Australian Aborigines\", described a game, which he referred to as 'football', where the players of two teams kick around a ball made of possum fur. \n\nIn the appendix of Dawson's book, he lists the word \"Min'gorm\" for the game in the Aboriginal language Chaap Wuurong.\n\nProfessor Jenny Hocking of Monash University and Nell Reidy have also published eye witness accounts of the game having been played in the area in which Tom Wills grew up.\n\nIn his exhaustive research of the first four decades of Australian rules football, historian Mark Pennings \"could not find evidence that those who wrote the first rules were influenced by the Indigenous game of Marngrook\". Melbourne Cricket Club researcher Trevor Ruddell wrote in 2013 that Marn Grook \"has no causal link with, nor any documented influence upon, the early development of Australian football.\"\n\nChris Hallinan and Barry Judd describe the historical perspective of the history of Australian Rules as Anglo-centric, having been reluctant to acknowledge the Indigenous contribution. They go on to suggest this is an example of white Australians struggling to accept Indigenous peoples \"as active and intelligent human subjects\".\n\nAdvocates of these theories have drawn comparisons in the catching of the kicked ball (the mark) and the high jumping to catch the ball (the spectacular mark) that have been attributes of both games. However, the connection is speculative. For instance spectacular high marking did not become common in Australian rules football until the 1880s.\n\nSome claim that the origin of the Australian rules term mark, meaning a clean, fair catch of a kicked ball, followed by a free kick, is derived from the Aboriginal word \"mumarki\" used in Marn Grook, and meaning \"to catch\". The application of the word \"mark\" in \"foot-ball\" (and in many other games) dates to the Elizabethan era and is likely derived from the practice where a player \"marks\" the ground to show where a catch had been taken or where the ball should be placed. The use of the word \"mark\" to indicate an \"impression or trace forming a sign\" on the ground dates to c1200.\n\nDue to the theories of shared origins, marn grook features heavily in Australian rules football and Indigenous culture.\n\nA documentary titled \"Marn Grook\" was first released in 1996.\n\nIn 2002, in a game at Stadium Australia, the Sydney Swans and Essendon Football Club began to compete for the Marngrook Trophy, awarded after home-and-away matches each year between the two teams in the Australian Football League. Though it commemorates marn grook, the match is played under normal rules of the AFL rather than those of the traditional Aboriginal game.\n\nMarn Grook is the subject of children's books, including Neridah McMullin's \"Kick it to Me!\" (2012), an account of Tom Wills' upbringing, and \"Marngrook: The Long Ago Story of Aussie Rules\" (2012) by Indigenous writer Titta Secombe.\n\n\"The Marngrook Footy Show\", an Indigenous variation of the AFL Footy Show, began in Melbourne in 2007 and has since been broadcast on National Indigenous Television, ABC 2, and Channel 31.\n\n\n"}

One month after the split from SFIO Senghor associates himself with the \"Indépendants d'Outre-Mer\" parliamentary fraction.\n\nIn the 1951 legislative elections BDS got 213 182 votes (67% of the votes cast in Senegal). Two BDS members are elected MPs, Senghor and Abbas Gueye (a local CGT leader). The electoral campaign was marred by violence between BDS and SFIO.\n\nBDS relied heavily on religious and tribal authorities to spread their influence. The combination of the capability to gather many different ethnic group and Senghor's personal charisma ensured BDS predominance in Senegalese pre-Independence politics.\n\nIn 1956 BDS won the municipal elections in Kaolack, Thiès, Louga, Diourbel and Ziguinchor. BDS lost in Dakar.\n\nOn August 18, 1956 BDS held its last plenary meeting. That meeting paved the way for the merger of BDS with the Senegalese Democratic Union (UDS), Casamance Autonomist Movement (MAC) and a fraction of the Senegalese Popular Movement (MPS) led by Abdolaye Thiaw. The result of the merger was the creation of the Senegalese Popular Bloc (BPS).\n\n"}
{"id": "2311409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311409", "title": "Q-Less", "text": "Q-Less\n\n\"Q-Less\" is the seventh episode of the of the American science fiction television series \"\" (\"DS9\"). \nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy, in orbit of the planet Bajor. In this episode, Vash (Jennifer Hetrick), a former love interest of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, arrives aboard the \"Deep Space Nine\" station trying to elude her companion, Q (John de Lancie), and make a profit selling archaeological artefacts from the Gamma Quadrant, including a mysterious alien crystal. \"Q-Less\" saw the return of Vash and Q, two recurring characters from \"\" (\"TNG\"). It was Jennifer Hetrick's final performance as Vash and John de Lancie's only appearance as Q on \"Deep Space Nine\".\n\nTwo former writers from \"TNG\", Hannah Louise Shearer and Robert Hewitt Wolfe, wrote the episode. While it would be Shearer's last \"Star Trek\" credit, Wolfe's work on the script led to him joining the writing team on \"DS9\". The producers wanted to introduce Q to the show in a seamless manner; when Shearer proposed a Vash-centric story, Q was added to the script. \"Q-Less\" highlights the differences between \"DS9\" and \"TNG\" by comparing the reactions of Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) and Captain Picard to Q. On its first broadcast, \"Q-Less\" received Nielsen ratings of 12.8 percent, placing it as the fifth most watched episode of the season. Reception was mixed, with reviewers criticizing the imbalance of time spent with Vash and Q in contrast to the rest of the cast, as well as the unnecessary technobabble in the story and the MacGuffin-like plot device represented by the alien crystal.\n\nLt. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) returns from the Gamma Quadrant in her runabout with a woman that Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) recognizes as Vash (Jennifer Hetrick) from his time on board the \"Enterprise\". Although the crew is unaware of his presence, Q (John de Lancie) — a nearly omnipotent prankster — has also stowed away on the runabout. Vash explains that she has spent the past two years in the Gamma Quadrant, but she describes her method of getting there as a \"private matter\". During their trip back to \"Deep Space Nine\", the vessel undergoes a series of unusual power drains.\n\nSoon after Vash's arrival, the station begins to experience similar power failures. In the meantime, Q appears to Vash, apparently infatuated with her. Q was the one who transported Vash to the Gamma Quadrant two years earlier, but now she wants nothing to do with him, much to Q's annoyance. When Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) asks Vash out for dinner, a jealous Q uses his powers to send Bashir off to sleep. Meanwhile, Quark (Armin Shimerman) arranges to auction off various items Vash has found in the Gamma Quadrant, including an unusual crystal that might fetch a high price.\n\nRemembering Q from the \"Enterprise\", O'Brien spots Q on the station and warns Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks), speculating that Q may be responsible for the power drains. When confronted, Q denies any wrongdoing, although he offers no alternative explanation. As the power drains become more severe, an unknown gravimetric field begins pulling the station toward the nearby wormhole. Q challenges Sisko to a boxing match on the Promenade, and suddenly, they are both wearing antique-style boxing costumes. A few punches are thrown, and Q is shocked when Sisko knocks him down (\"You hit me! Picard never hit me!\").\n\nVash and Quark auction the artifacts and the crystal receives bids in excess of one thousand bars of gold-pressed latinum. Casually joining the bid process, Q ups the ante on Vash's crystal to 2501 bars before bidding one million. Soon after, however, the source of the gravimetric field and power losses is traced to the crystal itself. The crystal is quickly beamed into space before it can destroy the station. Once outside, it transforms into an alien life form and travels into the wormhole. After the incident, Bashir finally awakens from his slumber. Unaware of what has just transpired, he yawns and tells Dax that he feels like he has been asleep for days. A bemused Dax gives him a strange look to which Bashir replies \"What--did I miss something?\"\n\nThe writers and producers of \"Q-Less\" developed the episode to show that \"DS9\" was still connected to the \"Star Trek\" universe. To facilitate this idea, two \"TNG\" characters, Vash, played by Jennifer Hetrick, and Q, played by John de Lancie, returned to \"DS9\". Vash made her first appearance on \"TNG\" in the episode \"Captain's Holiday\", and then returned in \"Qpid\"; Q had appeared in most seasons of \"TNG\" since the . \"TNG\" writer Hannah Louise Shearer, known for writing episodes such as \"\" and \"\", also crossed over to \"DS9\". \"Q-Less\" was the last \"Star Trek\" writing credit for Shearer.\n\nShearer's pitch featured Vash, who had last been seen at the end of \"QPid\" leaving with Q, but the pitch did not include Q himself. Executive producer Michael Piller explained that they had already been looking for a way to introduce Q into \"DS9\", and felt that bringing Vash onto the show would be a good way to seamlessly introduce Q. There were concerns about shoving Q into an episode but the idea of \"Q-Less\" alleviated them. \"If you just have him come on and say 'Look, is this the new show?' it's silly, but this seemed to be a justifiable way\", Piller recalled.\n\n\"TNG\" writer Robert Hewitt Wolfe, who had writing credits on a number of episodes, including both the previous Vash stories, converted Shearer's story into a script. His work on the first draft led to a full-time position on the writing staff for \"DS9\"; Q was added to the story at this stage. Q's motivations were drawn from his previous appearances on \"TNG\", but Wolfe found it difficult to create the interactions between Q and the other characters on \"DS9\". At the time the script was under development, there was little footage of \"DS9\" available. Wolfe could only characterize the motivations towards Q as annoyance rather than any real emotional engagement. However, he came upon the idea that he could demonstrate the difference between \"DS9\" and \"TNG\" by showing the reactions of the characters to Q instead.\n\nWolfe believed that if he had written the episode later in the series he would have concentrated more on the established characters and less on Q and Vash. De Lancie felt that the episode never explained Q's motivation for wanting to stay with Vash. \"I think Q is best used when he deals with large philosophical issues, and skirt chasing just isn't one of them\", he said. Because certain aspects of Q's character are left unexplored, de Lancie found that \"the style, the quips and the panache in which things are done become very important\".\n\nThe boxing scene was intended to differentiate the relationship between Q and Sisko from that of Q and Picard. \"Picard is an explorer, and in some ways, very much an intellectual. Sisko is a builder, a different kind of guy. He wears his heart a little more on his sleeve, and he acts on emotion, on instinct, more than Picard\", Wolfe explained. John de Lancie offered a similar opinion: \"Q's relationship with Picard has always been a battle of wits, but I come into Deep Space Nine, and Sisko just bopped me on the nose! From a character point of view, that's a very big difference.\"\n\nHetrick felt that the move away from \"TNG\" gave Vash more independence, and she enjoyed the new relationship between Vash and Quark, calling them \"kindred spirits\". She was also pleased to be working with de Lancie again. \"I love the way they write for John, and I loved the stuff we got to do together in 'Q-Less'\", she said. Hetrick underwent ten hours of make-up for the sequence where Q shows Vash what could have happened if he did not save her life following an insect bite in the Gamma Quadrant. The experience left her with a newfound appreciation for not having to wear prosthetics like other members of the cast.\n\nHetrick thought that if she returned to \"DS9\" as Vash, then something could be built around the Vash-Quark relationship: \"That would be a really nice pairing, because you have these two different backgrounds but they're both after the same thing.\" Towards the end of the , the producers inquired about Hetrick's availability. The actress was ready to appear on another \"DS9\" episode, but the writers changed direction and there were no further plans for the Vash character. \"Q-Less\" was the final \"Star Trek\" appearance for Hetrick, and the only appearance in \"DS9\" for John de Lancie.\n\nDirector Paul Lynch compared the production on \"Q-Less\" to a typical \"TNG\" episode. On \"DS9\", the shots were more complex and generally featured more special effects. Lynch said that the scene which showed Q seamlessly teleporting himself from one chair to another, changing his costume as he went, was particularly difficult. The producers, particularly Rick Berman, were determined for \"DS9\" to be the best that it could be, notes Lynch. The comedic elements of the episode required precise timing, with Lynch comparing it to the television series \"Moonlighting\".\n\n\"Q-Less\" was first shown on February 8, 1993, in broadcast syndication. It received a Nielsen rating of 12.8 percent, placing fifth in its time slot. \"Q-Less\" was the fifth highest rated episode of the season, behind , \"Past Prologue\", \"\" and \"Captive Pursuit\".\n\nZack Handlen reviewed the episode for \"The A.V. Club\" in 2012, calling Q an \"iconic figure\". Handlen said Q allowed the writers to compare the different reaction of the characters to his presence in \"DS9\" and \"TNG\". However, Handlen felt that Q was not a good fit for \"DS9\", as the character seemed like an afterthought. Also, the pairing of Vash and Q took up too much screen time compared to the main cast, Handlen noted, while the overall plot involving the \"stealth alien\" embryo \"plays like an abandoned script from early in \"TNG\"s run, and an example of a fascinating concept reduced to a perfunctory MacGuffin,\" Handlen wrote.\n\nKeith DeCandido, in a review of \"Q-Less\" for Tor.com, praised the relationship between Vash and Quark and thought that it should have been explored further. Like Handlen, DeCandido also felt that Q did not quite fit in \"DS9\", but acknowledged that his performance in this episode was an improvement over his later appearances in \"\". DeCandido described the boxing scene where Sisko punches Q as \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\". However, he thought that aspects of the plot had too much technobabble; for example, the embryo plotline could have been resolved by a form of Customs procedure. \"Ultimately\", DeCandido concludes, \"none of this matters, because it comes down to one great moment of Sisko decking Q. Bliss.\"\n\nIn Atara Stein's \"The Byronic Hero in Film, Fiction, and Television\" (2009), she compared the role of Q in both \"Q-Less\" and \"True Q\" as one where he reprises his \"satanic role\" and \"in each case [tries] to lure a woman to join him\". Stein also explains the Q/Vash relationship, saying \"Q's demeanor toward Vash is clearly coded as that of a potential rapist. He pushes her onto a bed and shows no compunction about threatening and brutalizing her.\" She explained that despite this treatment and the feminist stance taken by Vash, Q is treated sympathetically by the writers of the episode. It is made clear that Q could have won Vash around if he chose to, and so the character seemed \"sensitive and vulnerable, and Vash seems cold-hearted by comparison.\".\n\n\"Q-Less\" was first released for home media in the United States on VHS on November 19, 1996. It was released in the United Kingdom on DVD as part of the season one box set on March 24, 2003, and in the United States on June 3. The episode is also included in the \"Star Trek: Q Fan Collective\" compilation DVD set, which was released in the United States on June 6, 2006, and later that year in the UK on September 4.\n\n\n"}

The series follows four or five couples as they compete against each other to renovate and style houses/apartments and sell them at auction for the highest price.\n\nThe original series first ran for two consecutive seasons in 2003 and 2004, and was originally hosted by Jamie Durie.\n\nThe Nine Network revived \"The Block\" after a six-year absence, with a third season commenced airing on 22 September 2010, this time hosted by television personality and builder Scott Cam. Shelley Craft joined as co-host from the fourth season.\n\n\"The Block\" has a large number of commercial sponsors and prominently features brand sponsorships regularly throughout episodes.\n\nThe original format of the series featured four couples with a prior relationship renovating a derelict apartment block in the Sydney suburb of Bondi, with each couple renovating a separate apartment over a period of 12 weeks and with a budget of A$40,000. The apartments were then sold at auction, with each couple keeping any profit made above a set reserve price and the couple with the highest profit winning a A$100,000 prize. The current format is relatively the same except the series usually features five couples, it is mainly based in Melbourne suburbs and the budget is $100,000+.\n\nThe first season was filmed at Bondi and the second at Manly. The third season again took place in Sydney, in the suburb of Vaucluse. Moving to Victoria, Australia, the fourth season was filmed in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond, Victoria on Cameron Street. Breaking with tradition, season four was filmed in four side-by-side houses as opposed to an apartment block of four. Season four saw television personality Shelley Craft join Scott Cam in hosting the show.\n\nSeason five began airing in April 2012. As with season four, season five has retained the four separate houses format, as opposed to four apartments in a single apartment block as in earlier seasons. Season five is again set in Melbourne, on Dorcas Street, and is set in four adjacent multi-storey town houses. Season six returned to Sydney, in Bondi, for the tenth anniversary. The program has remained in Melbourne since season seven.\n\nThe first three seasons of \"The Block\" aired once weekly for 13, 26 and 9 weeks respectively. Since season four, the program has aired across multiple nights per week.\n\n\n\nThe first season of \"The Block\" began airing on 1 June 2003 on the Nine Network, replacing \"Backyard Blitz\" and \"Location Location\" in the network's flagship time slot of Sunday at 6:30 to 7:30 pm (AEST). The season was presented by \"Backyard Blitz\" host Jamie Durie and filmed in Bondi, New South Wales, with the majority of filming being completed prior to the series airing for editing purposes.\n\nSelected from approximately 2,000 applicants, the four couples in the season were:\n\nThe auction profits had a combined result of $.\n\nFollowing the success of the first season, an expanded second season of 26 episodes, airing twice weekly, premiered on 18 April 2004. The season was again set in Sydney, although in the suburb of Manly rather than Bondi where the first season was located.\n\nThe auction profits had a combined result of $ with two properties not selling at auction.\n\nSelected from over 18,000 applicants, the four couples in the season were:\n\nTwo original contestants, Dani and Monique Bacha, left the program in January 2004, two weeks into the second season, when it was reported that Dani had spent six months in jail in 2002 following his conviction for a drug-related offence. Andrew Rochford and Jamie Nicholson replaced Dani and Monique Bacha.\n\nAfter a long break, the series was revived in 2010 with a set of four apartments in the upmarket suburb of Vaucluse in Sydney being renovated and Scott Cam replacing Jamie Durie as host.\n\nThe auction profits had a combined result of $ with only one property not selling at auction.\n\nSeason four saw six major changes to the format of \"The Block\".\n\nEight couples were initially selected, with four being eliminated and the other four being given keys to the houses. The four remaining teams are:\nThe winners of \"The Block\" were Polly and Waz. They made $15,000 in profit and due to the other three couples' houses being passed in, they also won the $100,000 grand prize making them the winners. Also in this finale episode, Josh proposed to Jenna, his girlfriend for five years and partner on \"The Block\".\n\nThis was the worst auction in the history of \"The Block\" with auction profits having a combined result of $ due to only one property selling at auction.\n\nPolly and Waz were the only couple whose property sold at auction, with the other three failing to meet their reserve prices. Following the auction, Amie and Katrina's property sold for their exact reserve amount, meaning they would not take any winnings from appearing on \"The Block\". Also, Rod and Tania's property sold for the highest profit on \"The Block\", at $72,000 (however, as it was after the auction, Polly and Waz are still the winners).\n\nThis season, like season four, was also based in Melbourne, in the inner city suburb of South Melbourne with four double storey side by side terrace houses located at 401 – 407 Dorcas Street. The properties are all on separate titles with car access from Montague Street and plans approved to allow for a third story extension.\n\nEight couples were initially selected, with four being eliminated and the other four being given keys to the houses.

These votes were taken into consideration when selecting the contestants, and the four returning couples were announced in October 2012 as Phil and Amity (of season one), Mark and Duncan (season three), Josh and Jenna (season four) and Dan and Dani (season five). Phil and Amity won All Stars with a total of $1,670,000 selling for their home.

Filming took place over nine weeks from October to December 2012.\n\nDarren Palmer, who was a guest judge in the fourth and fifth seasons, replaced John McGrath as a permanent judge for this season. Both Neale Whitaker and Shaynna Blaze reprised their roles as judges from the previous season.\n\nThe Nine Network renewed \"The Block\" for a seventh season to air after Easter in 2013. The location for this season was 142 Park Street, South Melbourne. The building consists of 5 levels, with each couple allocated a full level to renovate. Alisa and Lysandra renovated level 1, Matt and Kim were responsible for level 2, level 3 was occupied by Bec and George, level 4 was completed by Madi and Jarrod and level 5 was made over by Trixie and Johnno.\n\nTwin sisters Alisa and Lysandra won \"The Block\", with a profit of $295,000.

Filming for the season was scheduled to occur between November 2013 and January 2014, and aired from 27 January 2014.\n\nSeason 8 was based in the Melbourne suburb of Albert Park, Victoria. The production company paid $5.9 million for 47 O’Grady Street, a brick warehouse that was then transformed into four luxury apartments.\n\nThe working title of season 8 was \"Fans vs Favourites\" as shown in the 2014 preview that was aired on the \"Big Brother\" 2013 finale. Returning to \"The Block\" were Brad and Dale (season 5) / Alisa and Lysandra (season 7). Joining \"The Block\" were The Super K's – Kyal and Kara, and The Retro Rookies – Steve and Chantelle.

Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions Robert Bromwich told the court that the apartment purchase gave Kamay's crimes \"a cloak of respectability\". The sale agreement was broken, with the apartment to be re-sold at a later date.\n\nThe ninth season of \"The Block\" featured contestants renovating a former office building in Prahran into luxury apartments, with the season subtitled as \"The Block: Glasshouse\". Filming began in April 2014. One of the contestants was former professional Australian rules footballer Darren Jolly and his wife Deanne as one of the couples. The season debuted on 27 July 2014 at the 6:30 time slot.\n\nShannon and Simon Voss won \"The Block\" with a profit of $335,000 + $100,000 winners' prize money, while Michael & Carlene and Darren & Deanne made the bare minimum of $10,000 above reserve.

It was premiered on 27 January 2015 where contestants renovate a former three-level block of flats. Darren & Deanne (season 9), Bec & George and Matt & Kim (both season 7) returned to vie for a spot as contestants. Former contestant Dan Reilly from seasons 5 and 6 returned, this time as an apprentice foreman (\"foreboy\") under Keith's guidance after Dan himself became a qualified builder, who was a qualified carpenter during his stints as a contestant.\n\nFormer contestants Darren & Deanne won the season with $835,000 + $100,000 prize money, and all contestants won over $665,000. This is the highest making combined auction profits with a result of $.\n\n\"The Block\" was renewed for an eleventh season, which went into production in May 2015. Season 11 put the show 'back-to-basics' after ratings declines during the tenth season; episodes were cut from 90 to 60 minutes, fewer episodes, the eliminations were removed and Thursday night episodes were dropped.\n\nFilming for season 11 began on 15 May 2015. This season renovated the former Hotel Saville in South Yarra - an octagonal, eight floor brick building. The title for Season 11 is \"The Block: Blocktagon\".\n\nCo-creator Julian Cress said that this season of \"The Block\" would have no tradies and only passionate do-it-yourself couples. In other seasons, at least one person in each team had a trade. The change came in the new direction in the back-to-basics change to the season. Cress said viewers would relate more to the characters who are big on spirit but small on skills when the show returned later in the year.\n\nThis season was sponsored by Mitre 10 (building equipment), Swisse Australia (vitamins), Aldi (groceries), Domain (money and apartment information), The Good Guys (electronics and kitchens) and Suzuki (transport).\n\nShay & Dean Paine won the season with $655,000 + $100,000 prize money, and all contestants won over $349,000.

In 2016, however, this would be the one and only season airing, and it did not air until the last quarter of 2016. It was once again set in Melbourne. On 27 December 2015, Frank Valentic teased a video saying that there are rumours of The Block going to Greville Street, Prahran.\n\nOn 18 February 2016, it was reported that \"The Block\"s producers had bought an old heritage-listed soap factory for $5 million at 164 Ingles Street, Port Melbourne. This address was confirmed by Scott Cam on \"The Today Show\" on 9 May 2016. Filming began on 26 May 2016. The series began airing in August 2016 and had 5 teams competing. The season premiered on Sunday 21 August 2016. This season's contestants, Julia & Sasha, are the first ever female same-sex couple to compete on any season of \"The Block\". The season concluded on 13 November 2016.\n\nThis season is sponsored by Mitre 10 (building equipment), Aldi (groceries), Domain (cash flow and apartment information), McCafé (snacks, beverages, and the McCafe Quality Award), Stayz (challenge and additional finale prizes), Suzuki (transport and viewer voting prize) and Telstra (Smart Home Technology and additional cash flow).\n\nWilliam Bethune & Karlie Cicero won the season with $715,000 + $100,000 prize money. Each team of contestants won $425,000 or more. The auction profits had a combined result of $.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, \"The Block\" was renewed for a thirteenth season at Nine's upfronts. Applications for the thirteenth season of the series opened on 9 January 2017, with energetic couples aged between 18 and 65 years old being sought by casting agents. Filming for the season is scheduled to occur between April 2017 and July 2017. The casting call also specifies first round couples will be reduced to final participants in the first week of filming, which suggests Season 13 will feature an elimination round similar to that of Season 5.\n\nOn 11 March 2017, it was reported that a vacant block of land at 46 Regent Street, Elsternwick, had been purchased for $9.6 million back in December 2016, with plans approved to build a five lot subdivision, meaning for the first time ever, they would be building a property from the ground up, instead of renovating an existing building. On 17 March 2017, it was officially confirmed that 46 Regent Street Elsternwick will be the location of \"The Block\"'s thirteenth season with filming to begin on 27 April 2017, however they will not be building a property from the ground up, as five old rundown weatherboard houses are being relocated to the location, meaning this will be the first time since the sixth season the contestants will renovate a house.\n\nIn June 2017, Network Nine officially announced the location and teams for the thirteenth season of \"The Block\", one team being Aussie Model Elyse Knowles and her Boyfriend Josh. The season will premiere on Sunday 30 July 2017.\n\nThis season is sponsored by Mitre 10 (building equipment), Domain (cash flow & house marketing), McCafé (snacks & beverages), Stayz (challenge & additional finale prizes), Volkswagen (transport & cash flow), Centrum (vitamins) & Youfoodz (groceries & meals).\n\nElyse Knowles & Josh Barker won the season with $447,000 + $100,000 prize money.

The auction profits had a combined result of $.\n\nOn 21 November 2016, it was reported the producers were looking at The Gatwick Private Hotel at 34 Fitzroy Street, St Kilda as a possible site for its thirteenth season. On 17 December 2016, it was reported that \"The Block\" producers and the owners of The Gatwick Hotel are currently in negotiations on purchasing the property. On 4 March 2017, it was reported that the Gatwick Hotel deal did not go ahead and that the producers are searching for another property, however on 6 March 2017, it was reported the producers were in a closing deal to buy the property as residents of the building are to move out. On 17 March 2017, it was reported that The Gatwick Hotel would not be the location of \"The Block\"'s thirteenth season, although there was still interest in the building. On 22 March 2017, Nine officially confirmed that the building had been purchased and will be used for a future season of \"The Block\".\n\nIn June 2017, \"The Block\" producers lodged renovation plans for The Gatwick Hotel with Port Phillip City Council. On 23 July 2017, the renovation plans were officially released, the information included that the network paid $10 million for the building (not $15 million as originally reported), it was confirmed that the site will have eight apartments, two-bedrooms on the ground level and three-bedrooms for the remaining homes, the existing roof to be partly demolished and a fourth floor built to include pergolas above outdoor terraces & a car park area would have six car spaces and bicycle parking, and each apartment would come with secure storage.\n\nApplications for the fourteenth season of the series opened in August 2017 until 10 September 2017, looking for couples aged between 18 and 65 years old being sought by casting agents.

Nicknamed \"the boss\" (\"le patron\"), Vandervelde was a leading figure in the Belgian Labour Party (POB–BWP) and in international socialism.\n\nEmile Auguste Vandervelde was born into a middle-class family in Ixelles, a suburb of Brussels, in Belgium on 25 January 1866. Initially attracted by Liberal politics, Vandervelde entered the Free University of Brussels as a law student in 1881. However, he soon became interested in emerging socialist ideas and, in 1885, joined the small Workers' League of Ixelles (\"Ligue Ouvrière d'Ixelles\"). In 1886, he joined the newly formed Belgian Labour Party (POB–BWP). He worked as an academic at the Free University.\n\nFollowing the extension of universal male suffrage in 1893, Vandervelde proposed a manifesto for the POB, known as the Charter of Quaregnon which would form the basis for Belgian socialist politics until the 1970s. In the 1894 elections, Vandervelde was elected to the Chamber of Representatives for the industrial city of Charleroi. He held the seat until 1890, when he transferred to Brussels which he held from 1900 to 1938. From 1900 to 1918, he held the position of president of the Second International.\n\nVandervelde was named Minister of State in 1914 and supported the policy of resistance to the German invasion of Belgium in World War I. In 1916, he entered the de Broqueville government. He was a delegate for Belgium at the Treaty of Versailles and subsequently involved in the League of Nations. In 1923, he helped to found the Labour and Socialist International of which he held the presidency until 1938.\n\nVandervelde's principle political aims concerned the extension of universal suffrage and social democracy. As a theoretician, he wrote extensively on the role of the state in socialism. In 1913, he was named a corresponding member of the \"Classe des Lettres et des Sciences morales et politiques\" at the Royal Academy of Belgium, later becoming a titular member in 1929 and director of the \"Classe\" in 1933. He was an opponent of King Leopold II's attempts to expand his constitutional powers through the creation of the Congo Free State in the period leading up to the Free State's annexation by Belgium in 1908.\n\nVandervelde held the portfolio of Minister of Justice between 1918 and 1921 in which role he supported prison reform, measures against alcoholism, trade union rights and women's rights. In 1922, Vandervelde joined a group of socialist lawyers including Arthur Wauter, member of the Belgian Labour Party, Kurt Rosenfeld and Theodor Liebknecht, members of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. They travelled to Russia as a group of socialist lawyers where they defended members of the Socialist Revolutionary Party in the 1922 Moscow Trial of Socialist Revolutionaries.\nThis resulted in his inclusion into a satirical poem \"Mayakovsky Gallery\" by the Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. From 1925 to 1927, he held the role of Minister of Foreign Affairs where he contributed to the Locarno Pact. He subsequently held a position on the Council of Ministers (1935–36) and Minister of Public Health (1936–37) in the government of Paul Van Zeeland.\n\nIn 1933, Vandervelde became the POB's first president but increasingly found his internationalism and reformism challenged by a new generation of Belgian socialists. During the Spanish Civil War, Vandervelde's desire to intervene was challenged by Henri de Man and Paul-Henri Spaak.\n\nHe was a freemason, and a member of the lodge \"Les Amis Philanthropes\" of the Grand Orient of Belgium in Brussels. His personal papers are held by the Institut Émile Vandervelde in Brussels.\n\n\n\n"}

It is funded by the Borusan Holding.\n\nThe Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra was founded as the Borusan Chamber Orchestra in 1993. This initiative by Borusan, a leading Turkish industrial conglomerate, entering into the complex and challenging world of establishing orchestras, was based on its vision of helping to bring polyphonic music to a wider audience of Turkish people. This group rapidly grew in both number of musicians and quality of musical performance, so that it became a symphonic orchestra in 1999. That same year, Maestro Gürer Aykal was appointed as the general music director and permanent conductor of the orchestra.\n\nOn 13 May 1999, at the Yıldız Palace Silahhane Building on the European side of Istanbul, the Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra performed its first concert and soon began offering concerts on the Anatolian side of the city as well. By the end of 1999, BIFO was performing two concerts per month, one on each side of the Bosphorus, at the Istanbul Lütfi Kırdar Convention and Exhibition Center on the European side and at the Kadiköy People's Education Center on the Asian side, thereby quickly becoming a true city orchestra. This pattern continues until this day, totaling twenty-four concerts per year, with performances on the Anatolian side now being held at the Caddebostan Cultural Center. For the international audience of the Istanbul Festival, the BIFO has become a well known and esteemed musical standard for many years.\n\nBIFO, under the baton of Sascha Goetzel, its newly appointed Austrian artistic director and principal conductor, continues to serve as a bridge between the people of Turkey and the European tradition in classical music.\n\nOver the years, the Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra has introduced classical music lovers in Istanbul to some of the world's foremost musicians. The orchestra has had the privilege of performing with virtuosos such as Maxim Vengerov, Vadim Gluzman, Dimitris Sgouros, Alexander Rudin, Suna Kan, Idil Biret, Fazıl Say, Ayşegül Sarıca, Meral Güneyman, Ayla Erduran, Verda Erman, Gülsin Onay, Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Olga Kern, Corey Cerovsek and Stanislav Ioudenitch. Celebrated guest conductors, who have led the orchestra include Igor Oistrak, Emil Tabakov, Giuseppe Lanzetta, Fabiano Monica, Alain Paris, and Ender Sakpınar. In addition, BIFO has also been accompanied by the \"Wiener Singverein\", one of the world's leading choirs.\n\nOne of the most popular traditions in its short history is Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra's annual \"New Year Celebration\" concerts. Held in December of every year, these highly anticipated performances are known for bringing cheer and goodwill to Istanbul during the festive season, not to mention positive cultural attention, through the participation of highly regarded local and world-renowned musicians.\n\nThe Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra opened the 2007–2008 season in October with a concert conducted by Gürer Aykal, featuring the young Canadian violinist James Ehnes as soloist. Works by Ahmet Adnan Saygun, to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of his birth, and by Sibelius, to honour the fiftieth anniversary of his death, were performed in this concert. The concert in November was conducted by Josep Caballé-Domenech and the guest soloist was pianist Emre Şen. In the New Year Welcoming Concert in December, the orchestra under the baton of Gürer Aykal accompanied soloist Turgay Hilmi in a work written specifically for Alphorn.\n\nThe guests of the Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra last season included conductor Andreas Schüller, Ferhan and Ferzan Önder piano duo, Ayhan Uştuk, Çağ Erçağ, Özcan Ulucan, John Lill and conductor Sascha Goetzel. In the gala concert, the orchestra hosted the prominent Philharmonia Chorus and performed Dvořák’s Requiem for the first time in Turkey.\n\nIn the opening concerts on November 19 and 20, 2008, the Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra was conducted by Gürer Aykal, who recently became the Honorary Conductor of the orchestra.\n\nOn 29 July 2014, Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra made its debut at The Proms at the Royal Albert Hall. In this concert BİFO played Mily Balakirev's \"Islamey\", Gustav Holst's \"Beni Mora\", Gabriel Prokofiev's first violin concerto \"1914\" (BBC commission: world premiere), Mozart's \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" (only the ouverture), Handel's \"The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba\", Ottorino Respighi's \"Belkis, Queen of Sheba\" and, as an encore, Ulvi Cemal Erkin's \"Koçekçe\".\n\nAfter the concert especially at the English press the concert got positive reviews. \"The Telegraph\" reporter Ivan Hewett wrote that the concert was \"superbly rich\". \"The Guardian\"'s Tim Ashley wrote that Sascha Goetzel is more than a conductor, is a total entertainer.\n\nThe same day, Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra launched their third CD, \"Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade\" by Onyx Classics in Great Britain.\n\nAfter a year-long selection process in the 2007/2008 season with guest conductors from four different countries, an international jury awarded the musical direction of Turkey’s foremost symphony orchestra to Austrian conductor Sascha Goetzel.\n\nGoetzel took over from Maestro Gürer Aykal, the Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra’s music director since the founding of the orchestra, and responsible for its artistic development. One of Sascha Goetzel’s principal duties is the preparation of concert tours and guest appearances of the orchestra in the framework of major European music festivals in the coming years. The orchestra had a special role to play in the 2010 Istanbul Festival when Istanbul held the title of European Capital of Culture.\n\nThe current principal chairs of the orchestra are as follows:\n"}

The station is owned by the Hearst Television subsidiary of Hearst Communications. WMOR's studios are located on Hillsborough Avenue in east Tampa, and its transmitter is located in Riverview. Master control and some internal operations are based at the studios of Orlando NBC affiliate WESH (channel 2) on North Wymore Road in Eatonville. WMOR is the only television station owned by Hearst that is not affiliated with any major broadcast network, as well as the only Hearst station that does not maintain a news department.\n\nOn cable, WMOR is available on channel 12 on Charter Spectrum, Verizon FiOS, and Comcast Xfinity in Venice, and on Xfinity channel 4 in Sarasota.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on April 24, 1986 as WTMV; branded as \"V-32\", it originally maintained an all-music video format. The station's owner and general manager was Dan Johnson, former mayor of St. Petersburg Beach, who previously owned the old WXCR-FM classical music radio station in nearby Safety Harbor. The station originally operated from studio facilities located on South Florida Avenue/SR 37 on the south side of Lakeland, with its transmitter near Mulberry in southwestern Polk County. Before the move to The WB, V-32 used to carry NBC programming as its local affiliate for Lakeland and Polk County, alongside WFLA-TV (channel 8) in Tampa and WESH (channel 2) in Orlando.\nAfter a brief period of broadcasting from the transmitter in Mulberry, WTMV relocated its studio operations to its present-day studios in Tampa in 1988. The facility had been a former headend office for Group W Cable's Hillsborough County system. Around this time, it transitioned to a conventional general entertainment format, filling a void left by WFTS-TV's switch to Fox. It aired a schedule of off-network and syndicated sitcoms and dramas, game shows, movies and cartoons. It also picked up several network programs from ABC, NBC and CBS that Tampa Bay's Big Three affiliates (WTSP channel 10, now with CBS; WFLA-TV channel 8; and WTVT channel 13, now with Fox) as well as those from Orlando (WFTV channel 9; WESH channel 2; WCPX, now WKMG-TV, channel 6) chose to preempt.\nWTMV became Tampa Bay's WB affiliate when that network launched on January 11, 1995, branding itself as \"WB 32\". By that point, it ran cartoons (such as \"Scooby-Doo\", \"Biker Mice from Mars\", \"Captain Planet and the Planeteers\", \"The Jetsons\" and \"The Flintstones\"), sitcoms (such as \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\", \"Blossom\", \"The Wonder Years\" and \"Too Close for Comfort\"), talk shows (such as \"The Richard Bey Show\"), reality shows (such as \"Check It Out!\") and movies. Johnson sold the station to Hearst Television in 1996, with the station's callsign being changed to WWWB-TV (in reference to its affiliation with The WB) following the finalization of the purchase on September 18.\n\nIn September 1999, WWWB lost its WB affiliation to WTTA (channel 38), as a result of a larger nationwide deal between The WB and the Sinclair Broadcast Group's UPN affiliates and independent stations (Kansas City sister station KCWB also lost its WB affiliation to a Sinclair station, KSMO-TV, now owned by the Meredith Corporation) one year earlier. WWWB changed its call letters to WMOR-TV on September 1st that year and rebranded itself as \"More TV 32\"—a moniker also adopted by its Kansas City sister (now known as KCWE). In August 2008, the \"More TV 32\" branding was dropped for the simplified \"TV 32\". On April 4, 2011, the station's on-air brand was changed to \"MOR\". To distance itself from the earlier \"More TV\" branding, the station spells out \"MOR\", instead of saying it as a word; however, it's still inferred as \"more\", through its slogan, \"Just Can't Get Enough? Get MOR!\".\n\nOn July 9, 2012, WMOR's parent company Hearst Television became involved in a dispute with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, leading to WMOR being pulled from Bright House and temporarily replaced with HBO Family on the main WMOR channel and This TV, with InfoMás in Estrella TV's slot. The substitutions lasted until July 19, 2012, when a new carriage deal was reached between Hearst and Time Warner Cable.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nThis TV was added to digital subchannel 32.2 in March 2009. It was followed by the launch of Estrella TV in September 2009 on subchannel 32.3. On September 26, 2019, MeTV was added to subchannel 32.2, replacing This TV.\n\nWMOR-TV shut down its Mulberry analog transmitter, over UHF channel 32, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal, originating from the market's antenna farm in Riverview, remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 19, using PSIP to display WMOR-TV's virtual channel as 32 on digital television receivers.\n\nPrior to the end of analog broadcasting for full-power stations in the United States, WMOR operated three repeaters in the Tampa Bay area. Its analog transmitter was located farther east than the other major Tampa Bay stations because of FCC rules requiring a station to provide a city-grade signal to its city of license—in this case, Lakeland, which is east of St. Petersburg and east of Tampa. Hence, the repeaters were necessary to reach as much of the most-populated areas as possible. This was not as much of a problem for the station from the 1990s onward, as cable gained greater penetration in the area. The station's former translators were:\n\nThe translators were shut down in June 2009, as WMOR's digital signal operates at a full million watts—equivalent to 5 million watts for an analog transmitter—and is more than sufficient to cover the entire market. WMOR's digital transmitter is also located at the market's antenna farm in Riverview, in central Hillsborough County, where all of the market's television stations except Sarasota-based WWSB have their transmitters, further making the repeaters redundant.\n\nSyndicated programming seen on WMOR-TV includes \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"Tamron Hall\", \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\", \"Family Guy\", and \"The Steve Wilkos Show\" among others. \n\nWWWB/WMOR was the original television broadcaster of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays when it began Major League Baseball play in 1998. Before that, as WTMV, it showed occasional telecasts of Toronto Blue Jays games, including Nolan Ryan's seventh career no-hitter in 1991, to accommodate the Tampa Bay area's unique population of Canadian snowbirds in the days before MLB Extra Innings and MLB.tv came to prominence.\n\nWMOR currently serves as the local over-the-air broadcaster of \"ESPN Monday Night Football\" games involving the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, airing simulcasts of ESPN-televised games (Hearst holds a 20% ownership stake in ESPN; the network's remaining ownership interest is held by The Walt Disney Company), and the company has right of first refusal for simulcasts of ESPN's NFL telecasts in a team's home market. WMOR, along with WFTS which airs the Buccaneers' preseason and \"Thursday Night Football\" games (the latter through the NFL Network), are the only Tampa Bay stations that air selected Buccaneers games without having weekly NFL coverage: the team's local preseason and NBC appearances air on WFLA-TV, their CBS appearances air on WTSP and their Fox appearances on WTVT.\n\nWMOR announced on March 9, 2017 that they would be the Tampa Bay Rowdies' exclusive broadcast partners for the upcoming United Soccer League season.

{"id": "2311447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311447", "title": "Urban culture", "text": "Urban culture\n\nUrban culture is the culture of towns and cities. The defining theme is the presence of a great number of very different people in a very limited space - most of them are strangers to each other. This makes it possible to build up a vast array of subcultures close to each other, exposed to each other's influence, but without necessarily intruding into people's private lives.\n\nGlobally, urban areas tend to also be home to concentrations of power, such as government capitals and corporate headquarters, and the wealthy and powerful people that are employed in them. Cities also organize people, create norms, beliefs, and values. As outlined by Max Weber in his book, \"The City\", \"there are five things that make a city: fortification, market, a law code, an association of urban citizenry creating a sense of municipal corporateness, and sufficient political autonomy for urban citizens to choose the city’s governors.\" In some countries, elites have built themselves enclaves outside of the central city (e.g. white flight in the United States).\n\nIn most of the Western world, urban areas tend to be politically to the left of suburban and rural areas, even if deindustrialization has reduced the influence of labour unions and the working class, the new urban left is supported by upper middle class white-collar workers, students and academics, and creative types (artists). Urbanites also tend to be less religious, more environmentalist, and more open to immigration than rural people.\n\nIn Canada, urban culture is also sometimes used as a euphemism for the culture of visible minorities (non-Whites). Sometimes this means Black Canadian culture, though since Blacks are a much smaller part of Canada's population than in the United States, the connection is less obvious. More generally, the phrase may be used to connote the multicultural, immigrant-friendly mosaic atmosphere cultivated by cities such as Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia, in contrast to the usually Whiter rural regions of those provinces.\n\nIn the United States, \"Urban culture\" has been used as a euphemistic reference to contemporary African American culture.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, the African American population was primarily rural. The Great Migration of African-Americans created the first large, urban black communities in the American North. It is conservatively estimated that 400,000 left the South during the two-year period of 1916-1918 to take advantage of a labor shortage created in the wake of the First World War. The 20th century cultures of many of the United States' modern cities were forged in this period.\n\nIn 1910, the African American population of Detroit was 6,000. By the start of the Great Depression in 1929, this figure had risen to 120,000.\n\nIn 1900 Chicago had a total population of 1,698,575. By 1920 the population had increased by more than 1 million residents. During the second wave of the Great Migration (from 1940–1960), the African American population in the city grew from 278,000 to 813,000. The South Side of Chicago was considered the black capital of America.\n\nThe massive number of African Americans to Ohio, in particularly to Cleveland, greatly changed the demographics of the state and Cleveland. Prior to the Great Migration, an estimated 1.1 - 1.6% of Cleveland’s population was African American. In 1920, 4.3% of Cleveland’s population was African American. The number of African Americans in Cleveland continued to rise over the next twenty years of the Great Migration. Other cities, such as St. Louis, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York City, also experienced surges in their African-American populations.\n\nIn the South, the departure of hundreds of thousands of African Americans caused the black percentage of the population in most Southern states to decrease. For example, in Mississippi, blacks decreased from about 56% of the population in 1910 to about 37% by 1970 and in South Carolina, blacks decreased from about 55% of the population in 1910 to about 30% by 1970.\n\nBy the end of the Second Great Migration, African Americans had become an urbanized population. More than 80 percent lived in cities. Fifty-three percent remained in the Southern United States, while 40 percent lived in the Northeast and North Central states and 7 percent in the West.\n\n\nOther:\n"}

He was born in Southampton, the son of Vice-admiral Sir Richard Bickerton and first served aboard HMS \"Medway\" in June 1774, in the Mediterranean. His first command came in March 1779 when he was given HM Sloop \"Swallow\" as a reward for his part in an engagement with a much larger opponent. Bickerton later joined Rodney's squadron in the West Indies where he took part in the capture of Sint Eustatius in 1781. Making post captain on 8 February 1781, he took temporary command of HMS \"Invincible\" and fought in her at the Battle of Fort Royal on 29 April 1781.\n\nWhen Britain entered the French Revolutionary War in 1793, Bickerton joined the Channel Fleet before, in October 1794, being ordered to transport General Sir John Vaughan to the West Indies, to take command of British land forces there. After another spell in home waters, Bickerton was sent to the Mediterranean where he spent much of the war on blockade duty and, after their surrender, oversaw the evacuation of French forces from Alexandria. He remained in the Mediterranean during the short-lived peace and when hostilities renewed was second in command to Lord Nelson there.\n\nForced ashore by illness in 1805, Bickerton first served as a Lord of the Admiralty and First Naval Lord before finishing his naval career as Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, having attained the rank of full admiral in 1812.\n\nRichard Bickerton was born in Southampton on 11 October 1759, the son of Vice-admiral Sir Richard Bickerton and Mary Anne Hussey. On 25 September 1788, he married Anne, daughter of Dr James Athill of Antigua. Bickerton succeeded as 2nd Baronet in 1792 when his father died. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1810 and served as Member of Parliament for Poole from 1808 until 1812. On 2 January 1815, Bickerton was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath then later, in May 1823, he inherited the estate of Wood Walton and on doing so began using his mother's maiden name before his own surname.\n\nBickerton joined the Royal Navy, aged 12, on 14 December 1771, although this was in name only: He was entered in the muster of his father's ships, \"Marlborough\" and later \"Princess Augusta\", but did not actually serve until June 1774, when he joined HMS \"Medway\" as a captain's servant. Subsequently, promoted to midshipman, he served under Captain William Affleck in the Mediterranean, returning home in 1777 on board \"Invincible\", commanded by Hyde Parker.\n\nBickerton was promoted to lieutenant on 16 December 1777 and served under Charles Middleton first on board the 90-gun HMS \"Prince George\", then the seventy-four, \"Royal Oak\" in March 1778. In May, Bickerton joined HMS \"Jupiter\" in the Bay of Biscay, under the command of Francis Reynolds. On 20 October \"Jupiter\" attacked the much larger French ship-of-the-line \"Triton\", forcing her to retire; as a reward for his conduct, Bickerton, on Middleton's recommendation, was in March 1779, promoted master and given command of HM Sloop \"Swallow\". \"Swallow\" spent just under two years in The Channel, cruising and undertaking escort duties. While on convoy duty during the Summer of 1779, Bickerton gave the order to disperse, having heard of the arrival of the combined Franco-Spanish fleet in The Channel. His prompt action allowed the convoy to escape. After assisting in the capture of a Dutch convoy, on 2 January 1780, Bickerton and his vessel were sent to the West Indies to join Rodney's squadron and subsequently take part in the capture of Sint Eustatius in 1781.\n\nRodney promoted Bickerton to the rank of post captain on 8 February 1781 and gave him temporary command of HMS \"Invincible\". It was in her that Bickerton took part in the Battle of Fort Royal, an action fought on 29 April 1781, off the coast of Martinique. Bickerton acquired his own ship, HMS \"Russell\", in May, before briefly transferring to \"Terrible\" but, finding her unfit, moved to the frigate, HMS \"Amazon\", in July. After service in the Leeward Islands and North American waters, Bickerton returned to England in \"Amazon\", arriving in Portsmouth in February 1782. In September, Bickerton was given the newly repaired HMS \"Brune\"; she was decommissioned in May the following year and Bickerton was without a ship until January 1787, when he commissioned HMS \"Sibyl\" and in her sailed for the Leeward Islands once more.\n\nWhen France declared war in 1793, Bickerton was given command of HMS \"Ruby\" and served in her in The Channel until September 1794 when he moved to HMS \"Ramillies\" and joined Lord Howe in the Bay of Biscay. In October 1794 he transported General Sir John Vaughan to the West Indies, to succeed Lieutenant-general Sir Charles Grey as the Commander-in-chief of British land forces there. Bickerton remained on this station until July 1795, when he was sent to Newfoundland. Bickerton returned home in November 1795 where he joined Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet on blockade duty in the North Sea. Bickerton served under Duncan for the whole of the following year, then in 1797, he and his ship transferred to the Channel Fleet under Admiral Alexander Hood. In 1798, Bickerton took command of the new HMS \"Terrible\", built in 1785 to replace the old \"Terrible\", scuttled after the Battle of Chesapeake. Later in 1798, Bickerton was given the title of Colonel of Marines, then on 14 February 1799, Bickerton attained the rank of rear-admiral and, towards the end of the year, took up the position of Assistant Port Admiral at Portsmouth.\n\nBickerton hoisted his flag in \"Seahorse\" on 13 May 1800 and was ordered to transport generals Abercromby, Moore and Hutchinson to the Mediterranean; after which he spent the rest of the war under Lord Keith, on blockade duty. On 10 June, Bickerton transferred his flag to the 74-gun \"Swiftsure\" and began a five-month command of a squadron off Cádiz before maintaining a blockade on the port of Alexandria until its capitulation on 27 August. Left to oversee the French withdrawal, Bickerton conducted this duty with such efficiency that he earned the respect of the French general, Jacques-François Menou, who also acknowledged that, \" ...the vigilance of Sir Richard's squadron had accelerated the reduction of that place, as it cut them off from all supply\". For his part in the British victory, the grateful Turks awarded Bickerton with the Order of the Crescent on 8 October 1801. Following the Treaty of Amiens, Bickerton, with his flag in HMS \"Kent\", was left behind in command of the Mediterranean Fleet.\n\nBy 1804, still in the Mediterranean and having transferred to \"Sovereign\", Bickerton was serving as Second-in-Command to Admiral Lord Nelson, maintaining a close blockade on the French port of Toulon and when Nelson received the thanks of the Corporation of London, he insisted that Bickerton received equal recognition. Bickerton was elevated to Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean when Nelson left to pursue the French Fleet across the Atlantic.\n\nIn spring 1805, a liver complaint forced Bickerton to return to England. He was promoted to vice-admiral on 9 November 1805 and then appointed to the Board of Admiralty in April 1807. He became First Naval Lord in the second Portland ministry in May 1808. On 31 July 1810 Bickerton attained the rank of full admiral and in March 1812 he left the Admiralty Board and, one month later, was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth with \"Puissant\" as his flagship. Bickerton still held this post in 1814 when the Treaty of Paris was celebrated with a Grand Naval Review at Spithead. The event took place on 24 and 25 June, before the Prince Regent and his allies. Bickerton was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 2 January 1815. On 5 January 1818 Bickerton was promoted to Lieutenant-general of the Marines, then General of the Marines in June 1830.\n\nBickerton died at his home, No. 15 The Circus, Bath, at the age of 72 on 9 February 1832. His wife outlived him by several years, dying on 2 March 1850. As the couple had no children, the estate passed to Anne's nephew, Vice-admiral Sir Richard Hussey Moubray. The lack of male issue also meant the baronetcy became extinct with his death. A memorial to Bickerton, by Francis Leggatt Chantrey, was erected in Bath Abbey in 1834.\nBickerton Island off the east coast of Australia's Northern Territory was named for him by the British navigator and cartographer, Matthew Flinders, who was the first to circumnavigate the continent.\n"}
{"id": "2311489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311489", "title": "Silver Badge Party", "text": "Silver Badge Party\n\nThe Silver Badge Party was an unofficial political movement which existed in the United Kingdom during and immediately after World War I. The Party consisted of several groups representing the political interests of former service personnel. It took its name from the Silver War Badge (SWB) that was issued to servicemen who had been invalided out of the forces.\n\nFirst to be formed was the National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers (NADSS), established following a meeting in Blackburn in September 1916 and initially linked to the labour and trade union movement. In April 1917, the Asquith Liberal MP James Myles Hogge sponsored a meeting at the National Liberal Club over the Military Service (Review of Exceptions) Bill, which proposed to reclassify those invalided out of the army to identify those who might be recalled to service. This meeting led to the formation of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers (NFDSS).\n\nThe NFDSS decided to fight by-elections to put its message across. In the Liverpool Abercromby byelection in June 1917, the NFDSS candidate polled a quarter of the vote. In the 1918 general election its National Executive approved five candidates, and local branches sponsored 25 more, considered Independent NFDSS candidates. In three Leeds constituencies, the candidates were nominated jointly by the NFDSS, the NADSS and the Comrades of the Great War. None of the candidates were elected although many polled substantial votes. In addition, the NADSS sponsored a candidate, Robert Hewitt Barker, in Sowerby in unusual circumstances, in which he inherited the position of unofficial Conservative Party candidate and won.\n\nThe groups were politically diverse. Hogge was a left-wing Liberal, and most of the NFDSS were similarly left wing: among the NFDSS candidates was Ernest Thurtle, who later became a Labour Party MP. Henry Hamilton Beamish was a member of both the Vigilante Society and the NFDSS. In the 1918 general election he was one of the candidates sponsored by the NFDSS branches but not approved by the NFDSS National Executive, again in Clapham.\n\nFollowing the election, none of the groups continued in active party politics. Hogge resigned as President of the NFDSS in January 1919. Following pressure from Douglas Haig, the NFDSS lifted its ban on officers being members in June 1919 and the three groups together with the Officers' Association began merger talks. At a Unity conference on 14–15 May 1921, they merged to form The Royal British Legion.\n\n"}

Catherine believed she was destined to work for God. She gained notoriety when she was accused of being involved in a plot to overthrow the Republic, and the downfall of Maximilien Robespierre was attributed in part to her prophecies.\n\nThéot was born into a peasant family and from a young age suffered from hallucinations. She undertook a long course of religious asceticism in the lay convent of the Miramiones () in Paris after which she was no longer of sound mind. In 1779 she announced herself to be the Virgin Mary, the new Eve, and the mother of God. After being held for a number of years in the Salpetrière hospital, she was set free in 1782. Not much is known about her activities for the following twelve years, but she made a home in the rue Contrescarpe and began to gather a small group of people who believed her prophecies. She believed that she was destined to be the mother of the new Messiah and was hailed as the \"Mother of God\".\n\nTheot taught her followers that \"God had permitted 1789\" and that revolutionary laws had been made through God's inspiration. Disobedience to the Convention, she taught, was disobedience to God. These and similar beliefs were expounded in small gatherings of around fifteen women followers, in a room in a friend's house. Most of the women who followed her were of humble condition, but among them were also associates of the former Duchess of Bourbon, who consulted Catherine Theot for her prophecies and had sponsored the publication of a \"Journal prophetique\".\n\nThe Theotists saw the redeemer of mankind in Maximilien Robespierre, and preparations for his initiation were put in motion. The enemies of Robespierre, resenting his theocratic aims, used his relations with the Theotists as a way to get revenge. What became known as the \"Catherine Théot affair\" brought her notoriety in 1794. On 15 June Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier announced at the National Convention the plot to overthrow the Republic, accusing Théot and the people who met with her.\n\nOn the 9 Thermidor Vadier claimed that a letter was found under Théot's mattress that proclaimed Robespierre to be John the Baptist of the new cult. Although the letter was likely fabricated, it was a way to condemn Robespierre for his connection with Théot and his Cult of the Supreme Being. The accusations lead to the arrest of Théot and some of her disciples.\n\nThe case was tried in the Revolutionary Tribunal, and figured in the proceedings of 9th of Thermidor. The accused were ultimately acquitted and set free. Catherine died in prison one month after Robespierre's execution.\n\n\n"}

The crisis ultimately had no impact on athlete participation, but members of the Ukrainian team did stage symbolic protests of the crisis during the Games (including most notably, all but the country's flagbearer sitting out of the opening ceremony's parade of nations).\n\nWith 80 medals, 30 of them being gold, the host country of Russia won the most medals during these Games, and set a record for the most medals won by a single country during a single Winter Paralympic Games. Additionally, Russian skier Roman Petushkov won the most individual gold medals in Winter Paralympic history, with six golds across skiing and biathlon events. However, following the Games, the IPC discovered evidence that Russia's performance had been aided by a wider state-sponsored doping program. This resulted in restrictions on the participation of Russian athletes during subsequent Paralympics.\n\nAs part of a formal agreement between the International Paralympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee first established in 2001, the winner of the bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics was also to host the 2014 Winter Paralympics. Following the second and final round of voting at the 119th IOC Session in Guatemala City, Guatemala on 4 July 2007, the city of Sochi, Russia was awarded the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nAs with previous Paralympics, the 2014 Winter Paralympics used most of the same venues that were used by the Olympics, situated within the Sochi Olympic Park and the resort of Krasnaya Polyana. Despite the IPC believing that Russia had \"zero track record in terms of accessibility\"—given that the Soviet Union passed on hosting the 1980 Summer Paralympics after claiming no disabled athletes lived in Russia, the venues were built to the IPC's standards, organizers were quick to fix some of the issues pointed out by officials during an audit of the venues in January 2014, and an IPC spokesperson stated that they were \"confident and expect everything to be ready for Games time.\" Organizers and the IPC hoped that the Paralympics' legacy would make Sochi a role model for inclusive design throughout the country, and IPC president Philip Craven went as far as dubbing Sochi the first accessible city in Russia, commending the country's changed stance on disability since 1980.\n\nThe Sochi Olympic Park was built by the Black Sea coast in the Imeretin Valley, about 4 km (2.5 miles) from Russia's border with Abkhazia. The venues are clustered around a central water basin with a synchronized fountain, allowing all indoor venues to be within walking distance. Off these, the venues used during the Paralympics included:\n\n\n\nA shortlist of 10 Olympic and 3 Paralympic designs were shown to the public on 7 February 2011, while the winners were revealed on 26 February 2011. The Paralympic mascots, Ray of Light and Snowflake, represented contrasts and inclusivity: their fictional backstories portrayed them as having respectively come to Earth from a hot planet and a cold comet. After Ray of Light overcame his struggle to adapt to a winter environment, he bonded with Snowflake through a shared passion for winter sports.\n\nThe opening ceremony of the Games were held at Fisht Olympic Stadium on 7 March 2014. Entitled \"Breaking the Ice\", the ceremony was themed around equality and \"breaking\" barriers, featuring ballet sequences set to music by notable Russian composers, and animated segments by Aleksandr Petrov based on the story of the firebird. During the parade of nations, Ukraine's athletes declined to participate in protest of the situation in Crimea, and was represented solely by its flagbearer Mykailo Tkachenko. In his opening speech, IPC president Philip Craven praised Russia for finally fulfilling its \"dream\" of hosting the Paralympics after previously passing on the opportunity in 1980. He called upon spectators to have a \"barrier-free mind\", stating that \"the sport you witness here will change you. Not just for now, but forever.\" The Paralympic cauldron was jointly lit by Russian Paralympians Olesya Vladykina and Sergey Shilov.\n\nAthletes representing forty-five National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) competed at the 2014 Winter Paralympics, an increase of one NPC over 2010.\nBrazil, Turkey and Uzbekistan made their Winter Paralympic debut in Sochi, while Hungary and South Africa, who participated in Vancouver, did not send any athletes.\n\nCompetitions in the 2014 Winter Paralympics were held in five Winter Paralympic sports, with 72 medal events in total. New for 2014 was the addition of snowboarding events, which were incorporated into the alpine skiing program.\n\nThe closing ceremony of the 2014 Winter Paralympics was held on 16 March 2014 at Fisht Olympic Stadium. Entitled \"Reaching the Impossible\", the ceremony was themed around inclusivity, and featured sequences paying tribute to Russian abstract artist Wassily Kandinsky, and Alexey Pajitnov's classic video game \"Tetris\". During his closing remarks, deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak stated that the Games had become a \"catalyst for our efforts to create a barrier-free environment in Russia\", and promised that \"this important work will continue throughout our vast country.\" Sir Phillip Craven congratulated Russia for hosting what he deemed to be the best Winter Paralympic Games, and stated that the Games' participants had \"shown the world that absolutely anything is possible and that life is about amazing capabilities and not perceived deficiencies.\"\n\nSochi's Paralympic medal design was unveiled in May 2013 alongside its Olympic equivalent. The design incorporates a \"patchwork quilt\" of diamonds, some of which are translucent, containing designs that reflect Russia's regions, and also contain inscriptions in braille.\n\nIn February 2013, following its successful broadcast of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, British broadcaster Channel 4 announced on February 2014 that it had obtained the broadcast rights to further Games, including the 2014 Winter Paralympics, and 2016 Summer Paralympics. Channel 4 planned to broadcast more than 45 hours of coverage from Sochi. Australian coverage was provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, including live online streaming. However, aside from the opening ceremony (which was broadcast live), television coverage was limited to a daily half-hour highlights show.\n\nIn the United States, NBC Sports acquired the rights to the 2014 and 2016 Paralympics in September 2013. Following criticism of its minimal coverage of past Paralympics (such as at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, where in contrast to its extensive Olympics coverage, it broadcast only five-and-a-half hours of highlights), NBC announced plans for a total of 52 hours of coverage during the Games, with at least 27 hours of coverage broadcast live, and live coverage of the opening ceremony. The majority of its coverage was relegated to NBC Sports Network, but NBC aired highlights of the opening ceremony the following afternoon, and live coverage of the sledge hockey finals. CBC Sports, in conjunction with the Canadian Paralympic Committee, produced and syndicated television and digital coverage of the Games in Canada for CBC Television (30 hours), Ici Radio-Canada Télé (French, 7 hours), Sportsnet, AMI-tv (coverage with open described video), and Yahoo! Sports Canada.\n\nAlthough concerns over LGBT rights still had a minor effect on the Games, they were overshadowed by a crisis in the Ukrainian region of Crimea which began during the Olympics, but became more severe immediately prior to the Paralympics.\n\nOn 27–28 February 2014 in the aftermath of the Ukrainian revolution, Russian troops seized control of most of the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine located on the northern coast of the Black Sea—roughly from Sochi, including civil buildings, airports, and military bases. On 1 March 2014, the Russian legislature approved the use of the Russian military in Ukraine, and Russian officials stated that their military forces in Crimea were not a breach of existing agreements between Russia and Ukraine. The Ukrainian response has been muted trying to find a diplomatic solution, with no military action on the part of Ukraine's government, which was formed in Kiev less than a week before the intervention. Russia vowed troops would stay until the political situation was \"normalised\". A referendum on whether Crimea would separate from Ukraine was held on 16 March 2014—the same day as the closing ceremony of these Games.\n\nThe effects of these developments led to several notable political actions surrounding the Paralympics. On 2 March 2014, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that British government officials were planning to boycott the 2014 Winter Paralympics in response to the situation in Crimea, while Prince Edward cancelled plans to travel to Sochi for the Games \"on the advice of government.\" On 3 March 2014, United States National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden announced that the United States would not send a presidential delegation to Sochi (which was to be led by Tammy Duckworth) at all, \"in addition to other measures we are taking in response to the situation in Ukraine.\" Neither of the boycotts affected the participation of their respective athletes in the Games; Hayden went on to say that \"President Obama continues to strongly support all of the U.S. athletes who will participate in the Paralympics and wishes them great success\".\n\nIPC communications head Craig Spence reported prior to the Games that there were not any boycott efforts among athletes, and stated that although the organization would keep an eye on the situation in the Crimea, \"we've obviously expressed our disappointment with what's going on in the political situation, but at the end of the day, we're not here to do politics. We're here to organize a sporting event.\" He went on to emphasize that the same level of security measures in place during the Olympics were in place during the Paralympics, ensuring that Sochi would be the \"safest place\" in the country during the Games.\n\nThe Ukraine team still participated in the Games, but Valeriy Sushkevich, head of the country's National Paralympic Committee, warned that \"if there is an escalation of the conflict, intervention on the territory of our country, God forbid the worst, we would not be able to stay here. We would go.\" Similarly to the Olympics, political protests and statements among athletes were forbidden during Paralympic events, although two major, symbolic protests by the Ukrainian team occurred during the Games. During the opening ceremonies, all but one of the country's 31 athletes declined to participate in the parade of nations. The country was represented solely by Nordic skier and flagbearer Mykailo Tkachenko, whose entrance was greeted with an ovation from the audience. Some Ukrainian medalists were seen covering their medal with their hand during ceremonies as another form of silent protest; Sushkevich stated that the covering was \"a demonstration that aggression and the high ideals of Paralympic sports are incompatible.\"\n\nOn 18 July 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency published the first part of an independent report detailing a state-sponsored doping program in Russian Olympic and Paralympic sport, coordinated by the country's Ministry of Sport and Federal Security Service (FSB), where positive urine samples were swapped in favour of clean ones in order to evade detection. The IPC found evidence that swapping of positive samples had occurred during the 2014 Winter Paralympics.\n\nOn 7 August 2016, the International Paralympic Committee announced that it had suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee. The country was banned from the 2016 Summer Paralympics. At the 2018 Winter Paralympics, the RPC remained suspended, but the IPC did allow clean Russian athletes to compete neutrally under the Paralympic flag (mirroring a similar decision by the IOC for the 2018 Winter Olympics).\n\nConcerns surrounding LGBT rights in Russia and the country's \"gay propaganda\" law continued into the Paralympics. On 4 February 2014, Norway's openly gay health minister Bent Høie announced he would attend the Games with his husband, as is common for cabinet officials to travel with their spouses. The Federation of Gay Games also started a petition calling for IPC president Philip Craven not to attend the Games if Russian authorities did not allow the Russian Open Games, a multi-sport event for LGBT athletes which organizers attempted to hold prior to the Paralympics, to occur. These games were faced with a bomb threat, and its venues arbitrarily pulling out of providing their services for events, which was believed to be a result of government pressure.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2311521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311521", "title": "Geology of Shropshire", "text": "Geology of Shropshire\n\nShropshire's Geology is very diverse and most geological periods of time, and most rock types, can be found within the county. There is also a large amount of mineral wealth in the county, including lead, barytes, limestone, coal and iron, which helped the area develop the industrial revolution west of Clee Hill and, later, in the Ironbridge Gorge area. Quarrying is still active, with limestone for cement manufacture and concrete aggregate, sandstone, greywacke and dolerite for road aggregate, and sand and gravel for aggregate and drainage filters. Groundwater is an equally important economic resource.\n\nUpon looking at a geological map of the county, the most obvious feature is the Church Stretton Fault. This runs from far to the South West (Wales, arguably Ireland), entering the county of Shropshire in the south west, near the small town of Clun. It extends north eastwards through the county, dividing the county in two, before coming to an end in the Cheshire Basin, beyond the town of Newport. The fault itself passes almost through Church Stretton, immediately east of the Long Mynd, and also passes close to The Wrekin. Another, extensive fault exists in Shropshire, the Pontesford-Linley Fault, situated near the village of Pontesbury, south west of the county town of Shrewsbury.\n\nThe oldest rocks in Shropshire are of Precambrian age and are to be found at Rushton, a mile west of The Wrekin, as schists and gneisses. East of Shrewsbury, on Haughmond Hill, the sedimentary rocks are of somewhat younger Precambrian age, and are being actively quarried for use on roads. The hill itself provides an amazing view across large parts of mid Shropshire. \n\nThe Wrekin is a prominent hill near the town of Telford. The sedimentary rock types are varied around the area, but lava and volcanic ash (tuff) from various volcanic eruptions form this famous landmark. However, The Wrekin itself is not a volcano, and never was. The primary igneous rock on the Wrekin is rhyolite; this has a pinkish colour and is usually banded as it is a slow cooling viscous extrusive rock. A particularly good outcrop of rhyolite exists as you drive between Wellington and Shrewsbury on the new A5 by-pass. Intrusions of igneous rock have been quarried in the past at nearby Ercall Quarry. Here, the main type of igneous rock that can be found is Granophyre. At Ercall Quarry itself, you can see the contact (boundary) between Precambrian rocks and the younger (Cambrian) sedimentary rocks. In the vicinity these contain fossils from the period associated with \"the explosion of life\".\n\nNot far from The Wrekin is the famous Ironbridge Gorge, named after the bridge that stands over the River Severn near Madeley. The geological events that took place here hundreds of millions, and then just tens of thousands, of years ago were what made the Industrial Revolution possible: deposition through geological time resulted in close juxtaposition of iron ore, coal and limestone (the basic ingredients for iron smelting), with a river large enough to facilitate transport of the products. The Gorge itself was carved out by meltwater flooding out from beneath a huge ice sheet that had moved here from the north and west, towards the end of the last ice age, some 17,000 years ago.\n\nMuch of North Shropshire is a plain which is a basin of Permian and Triassic New Red Sandstone, overlain by Jurassic deposits in a small area near Wem. This basin continues north into Cheshire. Faulting has occurred within the sandstones, because of basin extension during and after the infilling of the basin. Escarpments form small prominent hills within the plain. The basin is bounded on the east by the Hodnet Fault, which runs roughly from Shrewsbury to Market Drayton. East of this fault the sandstone is thinner. In the north west of the county near Oswestry are outcrops of Carboniferous Limestone and the Coal Measures.\n\nThe South Shropshire largely fall within the Shropshire Hills AONB. These hills were formed on a continental shelf, but buckled up into hills at the time of a continental collision: the Variscan Orogeny. The most famous of these hills is probably the Long Mynd, which is Precambrian in age and forms the west side of the Stretton Valley. East of Church Stretton is Wenlock Edge, a Silurian limestone escarpment. In between lies a complete succession through the late Precambrian, Cambrian, Ordovician and into the Silurian. Wenlock Edge is the equivalent of the equally famous North American Niagara Escarpment, which comprises Middle Silurian (Clinton Group) to Upper Silurian strata. These two escarpments were most likely in the same locale prior to the separation of the North American and European plates at the end of the Mesozoic Era, 60 million years ago. This is evident by the presence of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. South West of Church Stretton, and at the westernmost border of England with Wales, is the very rural area of Clun Forest. The rocks here are mainly Silurian in age, and whilst they are, on the whole, weak rocks that are easily eroded, the topography is very varied with an impressive landscape, and the hills were put to good use in Iron Age times with the use of fortresses on the hills across Shropshire, including Clee and Anchor.\n\nIgneous intrusions outcropping at the surface in South Shropshire are few and small, but much larger bodies are believed to exist at shallow depths, evidenced by geophysical anomalies and radon-bearing groundwater. Several sills of dolerite intrude the Clee Hills – Brown Clee, Titterstone Clee and Clee Hill itself. These are some of the highest points in Shropshire, and serve as outcrops for Old Red Sandstone, and also various Coal Measures and limestone. Indeed, Brown Clee is considered to be one of the best exposures of Old Red Sandstone that exists. South Shropshire was on the border of the Old Red Sandstone continent, explaining why it appears so prominently in the Clee area.\n\nThe Quaternary geology of Shropshire is equally fascinating, dominated in the Devensian by major glaciers flowing east from Wales and south from the Irish Sea basin, meeting around Shrewsbury and moving south as far as the Stretton Valley. The Wye glacier moved up from the south into the southern part of the county which, together with the meltwater deposits, have combined to create a diverse and complex series of deposits.\n\nThe Geological Survey Memoirs provide the most comprehensive details of the local geology but unfortunately not all the county is covered and all are now dated - most were published nearly a century ago. The last traditional memoir was that for Sheet 166 (Church Stretton) published in 1968; the Telford Memoir incorporates the studies undertaken for the new town development, on which it concentrates (published 1995) and the most recent (2001) is for Sheet 165 (Welshpool), which includes a little of the extreme west of the county. Otherwise the most comprehensive description is contained within Peter Toghill's book.\n\nDetails of local and regional studies are published by the Shropshire Geological Society.\n\n\n"}

It was written by David Fury, directed by James A. Contner, and first broadcast on January 19, 1999.\n\nIn the library, Giles shows Buffy a variety of crystals, ostensibly to teach her how to identify them. Later, on patrol, Buffy's strength suddenly deserts her and she is nearly killed by a vampire. Buffy reports the problem to Giles and demonstrates her poor performance when throwing knives at a target. At home, Buffy is disappointed to find that her father is too busy to take her to the ice show for her 18th birthday; she suggests to Giles that he could take her instead. Giles has Buffy stare at a crystal until she falls into a trance, then injects her with a mysterious substance. Meanwhile, Quentin Travers, the head watcher, sets up an extreme test for the slayer, assisted by two men named Hobson and Blair.\n\nBuffy tries to intervene when Cordelia's argument with an aggressive suitor becomes physical, but she is casually knocked aside. Buffy enlists the help of her friends to figure out what is wrong. She visits Angel who gives her a book for her birthday. He tells her about how he saw her before she was the slayer and how he loved her from the second he first saw her. Kralik, the captive vampire intended for Buffy's test, breaks out of his straitjacket while Blair is giving him his pills. He turns Blair into a vampire.\n\nGiles goes to find Quentin at the Sunnydale Arms building, but discovers that Kralik is missing and Hobson dead. Buffy, walking home alone, is confronted by Kralik. Blair chases her until Giles drives by and picks her up. At the Summers' home, Joyce hears a noise out front where she finds Kralik wrapped up in Buffy's jacket. Giles tells Buffy that she has lost her strength due to the injections of muscle relaxant and adrenaline suppressors he had given her, and about the test. Furious, Buffy returns home where she finds a picture of her mother bound to a chair and gagged by Kralik.\n\nBuffy goes to the Sunnydale Arms building, beats Blair unconscious and then is chased by Kralik until his need for pills becomes unbearable. Buffy steals them away, and slides down a laundry chute where she finds her mother. Kralik breaks through the door and grabs his pills back, washing them down with a nearby glass of water. Buffy had filled the glass with holy water, causing Kralik to burn from within. Buffy frees her mother as Giles arrives and stakes Blair.\n\nBack at the library, Quentin congratulates Buffy on her accomplishment, but Buffy is also angry with him. Quentin tells Giles that he is fired because his relationship with the slayer is more that of a father than a watcher. He tells Buffy that a new watcher will be assigned to her and warns Giles not to interfere before leaving. Buffy allows Giles to tend her wounds.\n\nGiles is fired, but he is still the school librarian and willing to help Buffy as a freelancer. Buffy is still without her strength and tried to open a jar in her kitchen. Xander tried to open it and ask Willow to help him out.\n\nThe story had the working title \"Eighteen\" as it is set around Buffy's eighteenth birthday.\n\nA reviewer for the BBC wrote that the slayer test made no sense and that \"Helpless\" would have been better if Faith, the second slayer, were also present. The review said the betrayal of Buffy by Giles, and the strains on their growing father-daughter relationship, was \"heart-wrenching\". Noel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" described the episode as \"one of the most overtly horrific, with creepy dark houses and blood-spattered rooms\".\n\n"}

It was written by Dan Vebber, directed by James Whitmore, Jr., and first broadcast on January 26, 1999. Feeling left out by the gang, Xander ends up accompanying a student named Jack O'Toole. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang are trying to stop an apocalypse.\n\nXander helps out the gang with another demon vanquishing, but Buffy worries about his safety and asks him to stay out of the fighting, upsetting him.\n\nWhen a student throws him a football, Xander drops it onto Jack O'Toole's lunch, resulting in Jack threatening to beat him up. Cordelia, having witnessed the event, tells Xander he is useless and extraneous, since all of his friends are slayers, werewolves, witches, and watchers, while he is nothing. Meanwhile, Giles informs Buffy that the end of the world is near. The Sisterhood of Jhe, a group of fierce demons, is planning to reopen the Hellmouth.\n\nXander gets himself a car in the hope it will make him useful and cool, but accidentally rear-ends Jack, who is sitting in a parked car. Jack threatens Xander with a knife, but when a cop shows up, Xander covers for Jack and gains his respect. They go to get the rest of Jack's friends who, being dead, need to be raised from their graves.\n\nBuffy, Willow and Giles are researching in the library. Giles leaves to contact some spirits and hopefully get their help with stopping the sisterhood.\n\nXander takes Jack and his group of friends to get supplies. He spots Willow leaving the magic shop and tries to talk to her; she tells him that she loves him before hurrying off to help Buffy. When Jack and friends try to initiate Xander into their group, he flees. He rescues Faith from a member of the sisterhood by hitting it with his car; they go to her motel room where she seduces him. Afterwards, she kicks him out, clothes in hand.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the library, Willow and Giles struggle to get Oz (in werewolf form) away from the Hellmouth. They sedate him and lock him in the basement.\n\nXander realizes that Jack and his group have built a bomb. He seeks help from Buffy, but she is too busy having an emotional encounter with Angel. On his way to see Giles he sees the group and drags one of them with his car until he confesses the location of the bomb. Xander finds the bomb in the school basement and vanquishes three of Jack's zombie minions, but Jack shows up and they fight. Xander positions himself between Jack and the exit door so that Jack has no hope of escaping before the bomb explodes. Jack defuses the bomb with seconds to spare and turns to leave, swearing revenge. He opens the door, releasing Oz, who immediately attacks and mauls him to death. Meanwhile, at the library, Buffy, Angel, Faith, Giles and Willow fight off a giant multi-headed monster and the members of the Sisterhood of Jhe before successfully closing the Hellmouth.\n\nThe next day, the bruised Buffy, Willow, Giles, and Oz sit at a table discussing how they saved the world from destruction. Xander, not knowing anything of their battle and vice versa, comes by to chat with them. After a few seconds of talk, Xander decides to keep his harrowing night-long adventure to himself (aware that his friends will never believe such a story, no matter how he tells it). As he walks away, Cordelia once again taunts him over being left out of the group, but Xander merely smiles and walks by... quietly secure and confident in his place in the world and realizing that with or without Buffy, he can survive on his own.\n\nDan Vebber wrote two scripts for the show: \"Lovers Walk\" and \"The Zeppo\". Although there are earlier episodes where Xander is central to the plot (e.g. \"The Pack\"), this episode is unusual in that the story is largely told from Xander's point of view. The world-saving activities of the main cast are portrayed as secondary until the plot lines eventually converge. In an interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\", series creator Joss Whedon said \"The Zeppo\" was \"a very deliberate deconstruction of a \"Buffy\" episode in order to star the person who mattered the least\".\n\nNoel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" wrote that \"The Zeppo\" had become a favorite episode of his, saying, \"What I loved about 'The Zeppo' is how Xander's feelings of abandonment pervade the structure of the episode, which is filled with moments that are (intentionally) dramatically unsatisfying.\" In \"Entertainment Weekly\" list of the 25 best Whedonverse episodes—including episodes from \"Buffy\", as well as \"Angel\", \"Firefly\" and \"Dollhouse\"—\"The Zeppo\" placed at No. 23. TV Squad's Keith McDuffee listed \"The Zeppo\" as the fifth best episode of the series. The episode was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Makeup in a Series.\n\nThe episode has proved influential on later television writers. In his \"Production Notes: Doodles in the Margins of Time\", \"Doctor Who\" executive producer Russell T Davies said that he was inspired by \"The Zeppo\", along with the \"\" episode \"Lower Decks\", when writing the 2006 \"Doctor-lite\" episode \"Love & Monsters\", which started an annual tradition for an episode with little involvement of the lead cast. Joss Whedon himself cites it as influential to his later series \"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\"\n\n"}

He was the son of Henri de Jouvenel and Sarah Boas, the daughter of a Jewish industrialist. Henri divorced Sarah in 1912 to become the second husband of French writer Colette. In 1920, when he was a mere 16, Bertrand began an affair with his stepmother, who was then in her late 40s. The affair ended Colette's marriage and caused a scandal. It lasted until 1924. Some believe Bertrand to be the role model for the title character in Colette's novel \"Chéri\", but in fact she had published about half the book, in serial form, before she and her stepson met for the first time, in the spring of 1920. Their affair actually inspired Colette's novel \"Le Blé en herbe\". In the 1930s, he participated in the \"Cahiers Bleus\", the review of Georges Valois' Republican Syndicalist Party. From 1930 to 1934, Jouvenel had an affair with the American war correspondent Martha Gellhorn. They would have married had his wife agreed to a divorce.\n\nIn his memoirs, \"The Invisible Writing\", Arthur Koestler recalled that in 1934, Jouvenel was among a small number of French intellectuals who promised moral and financial support to the newly established \"Institut pour l'Étude du Fascisme\", a supposedly self-financing enterprise. Other personalities to offer support were Professor Langevin, the Joliot-Curies, André Malraux, etc.\n\nHowever, that same year, Jouvenel was impressed by the riot of the antiparliamentary leagues that occurred on 6 February 1934, became disillusioned with traditional political parties and left the Radical Party. He began a paper with Pierre Andreu called \"La Lutte des jeunes\" (The Struggle of the Young) while at the same time contributing to the right wing paper \"Gringoire\", for which he covered the 1935 Nuremberg Congress in Germany where the infamous Nuremberg Laws were passed. He began frequenting royalist and nationalist circles, where he met Henri de Man and Pierre Drieu la Rochelle.\n\nHe was in favour of Franco-German rapprochement and created the \"Cercle du grand pavois\", which supported the \"Comité France–Allemagne\" (Franco-German Committee). Here he became friends with Otto Abetz, the future German ambassador to Paris during the occupation. In February 1936 he interviewed Adolf Hitler for the journal \"Paris-Midi\", for which he was criticised for being too friendly to the dictator.\n\nThat same year he joined Jacques Doriot's Parti populaire français (PPF). He became the editor in chief of its journal \"L'Émancipation nationale\" (National Emancipation), wherein he supported fascism. He broke with the PPF in 1938 when Doriot supported the Munich Agreement.\n\nJouvenel's mother passionately supported Czechoslovakian independence, and so he began his career as a private secretary to Edvard Beneš, Czechoslovakia's first prime minister. In 1947, along with Friedrich Hayek, Jacques Rueff, and Milton Friedman, he founded the Mont Pelerin Society. Later in life, de Jouvenel established the Futuribles International in Paris.\n\nAfter the French defeat in 1940 Jouvenel stayed in Paris and under German occupation published \"Après la Défaite\", calling for France to join Hitler's New Order. He fled to Switzerland just before the liberation of Paris by the Allies. Jouvenel was among the very few French intellectuals to pay respectful attention to the economic theory and welfare economics that emerged during the first half of the 20th century in Austria, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This understanding of economics is shown by his work \"The Ethics of Redistribution\".\n\nDennis Hale of Boston College has co-edited two volumes of essays by Jouvenel.\n\nLater in his life, Jouvenel's views shifted back to the left. In 1960, he complained to Milton Friedman that the Mont Pelerin Society had \"turned increasingly to a Manichaeism according to which the state can do no good and private enterprise can do no wrong.\" He was sympathetic to the student protests of 1968 and critical of the Vietnam War. He also expressed support for the Socialist François Mitterrand.\n\nZeev Sternhell published a book, \"Ni Droite, ni Gauche\" (\"Neither Right nor Left\"), accusing De Jouvenel of having had fascist sympathies in the 1930s and 1940s. De Jouvenel sued in 1983, claiming nine counts of libel, two of which the court upheld. However, Sternhell was required neither to publish a retraction, nor to strike any passages from future printings of his book.\n\n\n"}

He is the creator of several animated TV shows such as \"Bob's Burgers\" and \"Lucy, the Daughter of the Devil\". He is also the co-creator of \"Home Movies\" with Brendon Small.\n\nBouchard was born in New York City to a Jewish mother and Catholic father. He grew up in Medford, Massachusetts.\n\nA high school dropout, Bouchard was working as a bartender in 1993 when he bumped into a former grade school teacher of his, Tom Snyder, who asked if Bouchard was still drawing, and offered Bouchard a chance to work on a few animated short films Snyder was making. The shorts developed into Bouchard's first series, \"Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist\", which he produced. He credits Jonathan Katz, H. Jon Benjamin, and Snyder as major influences. \"Dr. Katz\" ran for six seasons, from 1995 to 2000. He also produced one season of \"Science Court\", another animated show made by Soup2Nuts.\n\nTowards the end of \"Dr. Katz\", Bouchard and Brendon Small teamed up to create \"Home Movies\". The show was picked up initially by UPN, which dropped it after five episodes; the remaining eight episodes from season one, and the subsequent three seasons, were shown on Adult Swim. The show was not renewed after the conclusion of the fourth season in 2004.\n\nAfter \"Home Movies\" concluded and another Bouchard pilot, \"Saddle Rash\", was not picked up, Bouchard created \"Lucy, the Daughter of the Devil\". The show's pilot was created on October 30, 2005, but it was not until September 2007 that the show debuted as a weekly feature on Adult Swim. He was a consulting producer on HBO's \"The Ricky Gervais Show\".\n\nIn 2009, Bouchard got together with \"King of the Hill\" writer and producer Jim Dauterive and developed \"Bob's Burgers\", an animated series about a family working at a hamburger restaurant. Bouchard grew up in a working-class family full of \"blue collar creatives\" and created \"Bob's Burgers\" because he didn't see that kind of life represented on TV. In 2010, Fox placed the series on the primetime slate for the 2010–11 television season. A special preview aired on Thanksgiving on November 25, 2010. When the series premiered, it received mixed reviews with a Metacritic score of 54 out of 100. However, as the first season progressed and concluded and the second began, critics began giving the series praise. The show has generally been viewed as a spiritual successor to \"King of the Hill\", which carried less emphasis on shock comedy and focused more on character-driven humor. A based on the animated TV series is in the works and is scheduled for a April 9, 2021 release.\n\nBouchard lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Holly Kretschmar. The couple married on September 3, 2006.\n\n"}

It was written by Doug Petrie, directed by Michael Lange, and first broadcast on February 9, 1999 on the WB network. Buffy gets a new watcher, and Faith lures Buffy into reckless abandon.\n\nWhile out patrolling, Buffy and Faith kill a vampire that was armed with swords, one short and one long. The next day in the school library, Buffy's supercilious new watcher, Wesley, identifies the swords as belonging to a cult of swordsman vampires, who were once led by a demon named Balthazar. Wesley instructs Buffy to retrieve an amulet that belonged to Balthazar, who he believes to be dead.\n\nThat night, Buffy finds the amulet but a group of Balthazar's vampires arrive before she can take it. Faith impulsively jumps into the vampire nest and is joined in the fight by Buffy, who finds the amulet. After handing it over to Wesley, Buffy leaves to take a school test. She repeatedly tries to tell Willow and Xander about the previous night and notices Xander twitch whenever she mentions Faith's name. Faith shows up at the window and she and Buffy leave to destroy another vampire nest. Exhilarated, the two go dancing at the Bronze where Buffy meets up with Angel. He tells her that Balthazar is alive and looking for his amulet. When Wesley arrives she takes the amulet from him and gives it to Angel for safekeeping.\n\nBuffy and Faith find Balthazar surrounded by his vampires, so they break into a sports equipment store to steal weapons. The police arrive and arrest them, but the two slayers break out of the car, causing it to crash and injure the police officers. The following morning, the Mayor is attacked by one of Balthazar's vampires, who is foiled by Mr. Trick.\n\nBalthazar demands his minions bring him the watchers, kill the slayers, and bring him his amulet. The enemy who crippled him is about to gain ultimate power and he refuses to let this come to pass. Willow presents Buffy with a protection spell and is ready to go slaying that night, but Buffy tells her that it is too dangerous and that she is going with Faith instead. The two run into several vampires and stake them, then Allan, the mayor's human deputy, grabs Buffy so Faith stakes him too. He dies before anything can be done and the slayers scatter. Buffy runs into Angel who tells her about Balthazar capturing Giles, while Faith returns to Allan's body.\n\nBalthazar questions the two watchers as to who has his amulet. Wesley is willing to tell him, but does not know Angel's name. Angel shows up with Buffy, frees Giles and a fight breaks out. When Balthazar captures Angel, Buffy tosses live wires into his tub of water, electrocuting him. With his dying breath, Balthazar warns them of his enemy. In his office that night, the Mayor performs a ritual that makes him unable to be killed. Buffy tries to talk to Faith about Allan's death, but Faith has disposed of the body and says she does not care.\n\nAlexis Denisof met Alyson Hannigan as a result of being cast as Wesley, and the two married on October 11, 2003. Denisof's role on \"Buffy\" would also lead him to become a regular cast member on the spin-off, \"Angel\".\n\nAfter Faith accidentally kills Allan, Buffy finds her in her hotel room obsessively scrubbing his blood from her shirt. As Richardson and Rabb note, this scene is reminiscent of Lady Macbeth's \"equally futile attempt to wash away guilt by washing away its physical signs\". When Buffy reminds Faith that \"you can shut off all the emotions that you want... but eventually, they're gonna find a body,\" she is referring to the authorities finding Allan's body; however the ambiguous grammar suggests that it is Faith's emotions of guilt and shame that will eventually find a body as well.\n\nA review for the BBC said the scene where Allan is killed \"signals a fundamental change to a more mature series\". It also said that Faith, who was initially concerned about the death, subsequently sheds all sense of responsibility and that without the death, Buffy might easily have become like Faith.\n\n"}

The after-effects of the Japanese occupation were still being felt in the occupation zone, as well as in the Soviet zone in the North. Popular discontent stemmed from the U.S. Military Government's support of the Japanese colonial government; then once removed, keeping the former Japanese governors on as advisors; by ignoring, censoring and forcibly disbanding the functional and popular People's Republic of Korea (PRK); and finally by supporting United Nations elections that divided the country.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. military was largely unprepared for the challenge of administering the country, arriving with no knowledge of the language or political situation. Thus, many of their policies had unintended destabilizing effects. Waves of refugees from North Korea (estimated at 400,000) and returnees from abroad also helped to keep the country in turmoil.\n\nThe short-lived People's Republic of Korea had been established in August, in consultation with Japanese authorities, and quickly spread throughout the country. The U.S. Military Government outlawed it in the South shortly after their arrival. The leader of the People's Republic, Yeo Un-hyeong, stepped down and formed the Working People's Party. The U.S. administration also refused to recognize the members of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, led by Kim Ku, who were obliged to enter the country as private citizens.\n\nAfter the surrender of the Empire of Japan to the Allies, division at the 38th parallel marked the beginning of Soviet and American command over the North and South, respectively. U.S. forces landed at Incheon on September 8, 1945, and established a military government shortly thereafter. The forces landing at Incheon were of the XXIV Corps of the U.S. Tenth Army. They were commanded by Lt. General John R. Hodge, who then took charge of the government. Four days before he arrived in Korea, Hodge told his officers that Korea \"was an enemy of the United States\".\n\nOn September 9, at a surrender ceremony, Hodge announced that the Japanese colonial government would remain intact, including its personnel and its governor-general. After a major outcry, Hodge replaced the governor-general with an American and removed all the Japanese bureau chiefs, though he, in turn, enlisted the former Japanese bureaucrats as advisors.\n\nFaced with mounting popular discontent, in October 1945 Hodge established the Korean Advisory Council. The majority of the Council seats were given to members of the Korean Democratic Party which had been formed at the encouragement of the U.S. and was primarily made up of large landowners, wealthy businesspeople, and former officials in the colonial government. A few members of the PRK were offered to join, but they refused and instead criticized the Council appointees for their collaboration with the Japanese.\n\nA proposal was made in 1945 for a long-term trusteeship arrangement. In December 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to administer the country under the U.S.–Soviet Joint Commission, as termed by the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers. It was agreed that Korea would govern independently after four years of international oversight. However, both the United States and the USSR approved Korean-led governments in their respective halves, each of which was favorable to the occupying power's political ideology. From a number of perspectives, it may be argued that not all Koreans necessarily favoured these arrangements. In the south the interim legislature and the interim government were headed by Kim Kyu-shik and Syngman Rhee, respectively, and the elections for which were met with a large uprising.\n\nThe USAMGIK tried to contain civil violence in the south by banning strikes on December 8 and outlawing the revolutionary government and the people's committees on December 12. Things spiraled quickly out of control however, with a massive strike on September 23, 1946 by 8,000 railway workers in Busan which quickly spread to other cities in the South. On October 1, police attempts to control rioters in Daegu caused the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a mass counter-attack killing 38 policemen. In Yeongcheon, a police station came under attack by a 10,000-strong crowd on October 3, killing over 40 policemen and the county chief. Other attacks killed about 20 landlords and pro-Japanese officials. The U.S. administration responded by declaring martial law, firing into crowds of demonstrators and killing a publicly unknown number of people.\n\nAmong the earliest edicts promulgated by USAMGIK was one reopening all schools, issued in November 1945. No immediate changes were made in the educational system, which was simply carried over from the Japanese colonial period. In this area, as in others, the military government sought to maintain the forms of the Japanese occupation system.\n\nAlthough it did not implement sweeping educational reforms, the military government did lay the foundations for reforms which were implemented early in the First Republic. In 1946, a council of about 100 Korean educators was convened to map out the future path of Korean education.\n\nAlthough the military government was hostile to leftism from the beginning, it did initially tolerate the activities of left-wing political groups, including the Korean Communist Party. They had attempted to strike a balance between hard-left and hard-right groups, encouraging moderation. However, these overtures frequently had the adverse effect of angering powerful leaders such as Syngman Rhee.\n\nThis period of reconciliation did not last long. Within a short time, the military government actively disempowered and eventually banned popular organizations that were gaining support within the general public, including the People's Republic of Korea. The justification given by the USAMGIK was its suspicion that they were aligned with the communist bloc, despite professing a relatively moderate stance compared to the actual Korean Communist Party, which had also been banned at this time.\n\nAt the time of division, the overwhelming majority of Korean industry was concentrated in the North, while most of the agricultural land was in the South. Power lines and shipping connections were maintained during this period, but were frequently and unpredictably cut off. The North, controlled during this period by the Soviet Union, had the ability to wreak havoc in the South by cutting off the supply of electricity or fertilizer, and frequently did so.\n\nThe economy of South Korea did not fare well during this period, although the foundations of recovery were laid. Counterfeiting was reportedly a serious problem during this period.\n\nFollowing the constitutional assembly and presidential elections held in May and July 1948 respectively, the Republic of Korea was officially proclaimed on August 15, 1948. American troops finally withdrew in 1949.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2311563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311563", "title": "Anton Flettner", "text": "Anton Flettner\n\nAnton Flettner (November 1, 1885 – December 29, 1961) was a German aviation engineer and inventor. Born in Eddersheim (today a district of Hattersheim am Main), Flettner made important contributions to airplane, helicopter, vessel, and automobile designs.\n\nAfter serving Germany in both World Wars, Anton Flettner emigrated to the United States post World War II as a consultant to the office of Naval Research at the United States Navy.\n\nAnton Flettner attended the Fulda State Teachers College in Fulda, Germany. He was the village teacher in Pfaffenwiesbach from 1906-1909. Flettner subsequently taught high school mathematics and physics in Frankurt, where he developed ideas that would assist Germany in World War I.\n\nFlettner revolutionized the art of harnessing the wind, used essentially in an unaltered form for thousands of years—the canvas sail—by a modern machine—the Flettner Rotor ship—that could permit ocean liners to reduce their crews by two-thirds and save 90 percent in fuel.\n\nFrom 1914-1918 Anton Flettner worked at the German Ministry for War in the development of remote controls for air, water, and land vehicles. While employed under the aegis of Graf Zeppelin, Flettner also developed pilotless aircraft projects.\n\nAt the age of 29, Flettner presented his first invention, a steerable torpedo, to the Kriegsmarine (German Imperial Navy) of World War I. This, and his next invention, a remote-controlled combat car, which was presented to the Heer (German Army), were rejected because they were not considered to be technically feasible. However, Flettner's efforts culminated in the prototype Siemens Schuckert Werke 1000 kg wire guided air to surface missile of 1918.\n\nDuring World War I, Flettner developed the servo tab / anti-servo tab. The servo tab evolved into the \"trim tab\" which is still in use on all airplanes and many large vessels. Trim tabs are extremely useful in moving large rudders on vessels with vastly reduced power.\n\nFollowing World War I, Flettner was named Managing Director of the Institute for Aero and Hydro Dynamics in Amsterdam. He held that post until 1931. In the 1920s, Flettner also invented the famous Flettner rotary ventilator, which was widely used on buses, vans, boats, railroad cars, campervans, and trucks to assist cooling without the use of energy. Modern derivatives of his ventilator are still manufactured in Britain by Flettner Ventilator Limited. \n\nWith assistance from Albert Betz (German physicist), Jakob Ackeret (Swiss aeronautical engineer), Ludwig Prandtl (German engineer), and Albert Einstein (German theoretical physicist), Anton Flettner constructed an experimental rotor vessel (Buckau later renamed the Baden-Baden) in October 1924 at the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft. The Buckau was a schooner refitted with two rotating 50-foot cylinders and was the first vessel built with a propulsion system based on the Magnus effect. Flettner came upon the idea while at the beach with his wife. Flettner used sand, flowing over his rotating hand, to describe the Magnus effect and realized its potential for sail propulsion. The \"Baden-Baden\" crossed the Atlantic in 1926. It could outsail normal schooners under moderate to heavy winds, but it was destroyed by a storm in 1931. A commercial ship, the \"Barbara\" Rotor ship, was also built and sailed to the United States.\n\nIn 1926, Anton Flettner shifted his focus to aviation in founding his own company, the Anton Flettner Aircraft Corporation in Berlin, aiming at the application of the Flettner-rotor as a wing replacement on large wind turbines. In 1935, Flettner built a German night reconnaissance and anti-submarine autogyro called the Fl 184. Flettner followed this accomplishment by building the Flettner Fl 185 in 1936, an experimental German gyrodyne, which could fly as both a helicopter and as a gyroplane.\n\nIn 1938 Flettner, together with Kurt Hohenemser, built the Flettner Fl 265. The Flettner Fl 265 addressed the problem of torque compensation as the first helicopter with counter-rotating rotors (Flettner double rotor).\nDuring World War II, Anton Flettner headed Flettner Flugzeubau GmbH, which specialized in reconnaissance helicopters for the German Luftwaffe (Air Force).\n\nFlettner's helicopter inventions were financed from wealth acquired from his ventilator business, a company that was enhanced by the skill of his wife, Lydia Freudenberg Flettner. Anton Flettner built his helicopters for the German military, primarily for navy spotter use. Although his wife was Jewish, he held a personal relationship with the head of gestapo, Heinrich Himmler. Himmler had Flettner's wife and family escorted safely to Sweden for the duration of the war. Anton Flettner's partner and confidant was Dr. Kurt Hohenemser, a brilliant and thorough engineer who developed the details necessary for the success of Flettner's helicopters. Dr. Hohenemser's father was also Jewish, yet both remained unharmed during their tenure together throughout the war as they worked to develop the helicopter for military use.\n\nWhile the final product, the Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri (\"Hummingbird\"), could be factory-assembled, Flettner and Hohenemser insisted that they were the only ones who were capable of assembling the complex intermeshing rotor gearbox assembly. Plans for mass production of 1,000 Flettner Fl 282 helicopters by BMW were disrupted when allied forces bombed the designated factory.\n\nAt least two other Flettner helicopters were under development when World War II ended. They were the Flettner Fl 285, another reconnaissance helicopter with a two-hour flight limit and capacity to carry two small bombs, and the Flettner Fl 339, a large transport helicopter project designed for approximately 20 passengers.\n\nUpon the war's conclusion, Anton Flettner was held in the \"Dustbin\" interrogation camp at Kransberg Castle. After 1945, Flettner, along with many other aviation pioneers, was brought to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. Flettner and his partner, Dr. Kurt Hohenemser, were among the first German emigrants into the United States after World War II.\n\nFlettner started Flettner Aircraft Corporation, which developed helicopters for the U.S. military. \nIn 1949, Flettner employed Kurt Hohenemser as a consultant to the Flettner Aircraft Corporation. Flettner and Kurt Hohenemser, who together developed numerous patents in Germany, kept in close contact after both men emigrated to the United States.\n\nFlettner's company in the U.S. was not commercially successful, but his work was shared with the US Army Air Forces. Throughout his 14 years in the United States, Flettner was active in carrying out research projects for the US Army, US Air Force, and the US Navy.\n\nFlettner became the chief designer of Kaman Aircraft and many of the Flettner design concepts are found in Kaman helicopters of later years.\n\nToday the Flettner rotor is in operation as a supplemental propulsion system for transport and research vessels. There are two ships utilizing the concept of the Flettner rotor in a modified form, the turbosail Acyone developed by Jacques-Yves Cousteau in 1985 and the E-Ship 1, a cargo ship that made its first voyage in 2010. Albert Einstein praised the Flettner Rotor ship as having great practical importance.\n\nAnton Flettner's colleague and former partner, Kurt Hohenemser, worked his remaining years in the United States to prove Flettner's idea that properly designed flexible helicopter-type rotors are more suitable for producing electricity from the wind than rigid airplane-type rotors. A Norwegian project announced in February 2017, involving Dr. Techn. Olav Olsen and Seawind, aims to demonstrate the wind energy applications put forth by Anton Flettner, Kurt Hohenemser, and Glidden Doman (American aeronautical engineer) in harsh wind and sea conditions.\n\nAnton Flettner died at age 76 in New York City on December 29, 1961. Among his many distinctions, Anton Flettner was an honorary member of the American Helicopter Society and the Convertible Aircraft Pioneers. Flettner's birthplace home and tomb are national historic protected monuments in Germany.\n\n\n\n"}

It was written by Marti Noxon, directed by Michael Gershman, and first broadcast on February 16, 1999.\n\nBuffy dreams that she is being pulled underwater by the corpse of Deputy Mayor Allan Finch; when she manages to reach the surface, her fellow vampire slayer, Faith, pushes her back down. Faith's plan to cover up her accidental killing of the deputy mayor fails when Allan's body is recovered from the water. Wesley Wyndam-Pryce orders the slayers to investigate the death to see if anything supernatural was involved. Privately, Faith asks if Buffy is going to turn her in, and Buffy is not sure. Buffy and Faith sneak into City Hall to try to find out what Allan was doing in the alleyway in the first place. They find that all of his papers have been shredded, and that the mayor is in league with Mr. Trick.\n\nAfter much thought and discussion with Willow, Buffy decides to tell Giles what happened, only to discover that Faith has already told him that Buffy was the killer. Giles easily sees through the lie, though he lets Faith think he believes her so the gang can keep closer tabs on her and get her off the slippery slope she is on. Giles tells Buffy that accidental human deaths do occur in the fight against vampires, and that Faith is in denial about the killing. Wesley overhears the conversation and calls the Watcher Council.\n\nWhile offering to help, Xander reveals to the gang that he slept with Faith. Willow tries to play down her reaction but ends up crying alone in the bathroom. Buffy expresses her worry about Faith and the need to deal with the problem now.\n\nXander tries to reason with Faith, but she throws him on the bed, teasing she could do anything she wanted to him, and proceeds to strangle him. Angel bursts in and clobbers her with a bat. Angel then tries his own brand of reasoning and seems to be making progress. The mayor and Mr. Trick watch Buffy and Faith's City Hall break-in on CCTV. The mayor says that the slayers both have to be taken care of and quickly as there is not enough evidence to put them in jail.\n\nHelped by others with crosses and nets, Wesley attacks Angel and shackles Faith for transport to the Watcher Council in England. She quickly escapes, and plans to hop a boat out of Sunnydale. On his return to the library, a bruised Wesley receives a very hostile reception from the gang. Buffy finds Faith and tries to reason with her, but ends up hitting her. Their confrontation is interrupted by several vampires led by Mr. Trick. As he is about to bite Buffy, Faith stakes him. Buffy returns to the library, convinced that there is still good in Faith. In the final scene Faith approaches the mayor and offers to replace Mr. Trick as his assistant.\n\nA review for the BBC criticized \"Consequences\", which followed the events of the previous episode \"Bad Girls\", for its heavy dialogue, abrupt location changes, and the predictability of Faith teaming up with the mayor. Noel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" said \"Consequences\" was necessary to progress the story arc, but \"doesn't really work as a stand-alone episode\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2311577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311577", "title": "Ventricular hypertrophy", "text": "Ventricular hypertrophy\n\nVentricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur.\n\nVentricular hypertrophy can result from a variety of conditions, both adaptive and maladaptive. For example, it occurs in what is regarded as a physiologic, adaptive process in pregnancy in response to increased blood volume; but can also occur as a consequence of ventricular remodeling following a heart attack. Importantly, pathologic and physiologic remodeling engage different cellular pathways in the heart and result in different gross cardiac phenotypes.\n\nThe ventricles are the chambers in the heart responsible for pumping blood either to the lungs (right ventricle) or to the rest of the body (left ventricle). Ventricular hypertrophy may be divided into two categories: concentric (maladaptive) hypertrophy and eccentric (adaptive) hypertrophy.\n\nConcentric hypertrophy results from various stressors to the heart including hypertension, congenital heart defects (such as Tetralogy of Fallot), valvular defects (aortic coarction or stenosis), and primary defects of the myocardium which directly cause hypertrophy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). The underlying commonality in these disease states is an increase in pressures that the ventricles experience. For example, in tetralogy of Fallot, the right ventricle is exposed to the high pressures of the left heart due to a defect in the septum; as a result the right ventricle undergoes hypertrophy to compensate for these increased pressures. Similarly, in systemic hypertension, the left ventricle must work harder to overcome the higher pressures of the vascular system and responds by thickening to deal with increased wall stress.\n\nConcentric hypertrophy is characterized by an addition of sarcomeres (the contractile units of cardiac cells) in parallel. The result is an increase in thickness of the myocardium without a corresponding increase in ventricular size. This is maladaptive largely because there is not a corresponding proliferation of the vasculature supplying the myocardium, resulting in ischemic areas of the heart. Ultimately, this response can be compensatory for a duration, and allow for improved cardiac function in the face of stressors. However, this type of hypertrophy can result in a dilated ventricle which is unable to effectively pump blood, leading to heart failure. When stressors that encourage this concentric hypertrophy are reduced or eliminated (either surgically corrected in the case of cardiac defects, or hypertension is reduced from diet and exercise) it is possible for the heart to undergo 'reverse remodeling', returning to a somewhat more 'normal' state instead of progressing to a dilated, pathologic phenotype.\n\nEccentric hypertrophy is generally regarded as healthy, or physiologic hypertrophy and is often termed \"athlete's heart.\" It is the normal response to healthy exercise or pregnancy, which results in an increase in the heart's muscle mass and pumping ability. It is a response to 'volume-overload', either as a result of increased blood return to the heart during exercise, or a response to an actual increase in absolute blood volume as in pregnancy. This increase in pumping ability is the result of the addition of sarcomeres in series, which enables the heart to contract with greater force. This is explained by the Frank Starling mechanism, which describes the sarcomere's ability to contract with greater force as more of the elements of its contractile units become engaged. This response can be dramatic; in trained athletes have hearts that have left ventricular mass up to 60% greater than untrained subjects. Rowers, cyclists, and cross-country skiers tend to have the largest hearts, with an average left ventricular wall thickness of 1.3 centimeters, compared to 1.1 centimeters in average adults. Though eccentric hypertrophy is termed 'athlete's heart' it is typically only found in individuals who are aerobically conditioned. For example, weight lifters tend to undergo remodeling which more closely resembles concentric hypertrophy, as the heart does not experience a volume-overload, but instead responds to transient pressure overload as a consequence of increased vascular resistance from pressures exerted on arteries by sustained muscular contraction.\n\nThough it is the case that eccentric hypertrophy is largely considered to be a healthy response to increased cardiac demand, it is also associated with risks. For example, in athletes with significantly increased left ventricular weight there is also a corresponding increased risk for conduction abnormalities and sudden cardiac death. Additionally, in pregnant individuals, a subpopulation progress to peripartum cardiomyopathy, characterized by a dilation of the left ventricle and a corresponding deficit in heart function. There are suggestions that this progression is partially determined by underlying metabolic derangement (diabetes) and hypertension which may result in a more maladaptive cardiac response to pregnancy. As such, though it is convenient to consider clear cut distinctions between pathologic and physiologic cardiac hypertrophy, there may be a broader range of phenotypes than may be accounted for by gross cardiac phenotypes alone.\n\nThe development of pathologic states in LVH is complex. Electrical abnormalities are commonly found in individuals with LVH, both ventricular and super-ventricular tachycardia. Additionally, cytoarchitecture and the extracellular environment of the myocardium are altered, specifically genes typically expressed in the fetal heart are induced, as are collagen and other fibrotic proteins. LVH may interfere with heart functionality in a number of ways. Before progression to a dilated phenotype, mechanical obstruction of the outflow tract can occur, leading to reduced cardiac output. Additionally, increased fibrosis of the ventricle can result in a failure to relax appropriately which impairs cardiac filling and may lead to diastolic dysfunction or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\n\nIn individuals with eccentric hypertrophy there may be little or no indication that hypertrophy has occurred as it is generally a healthy response to increased demands on the heart. Conversely, concentric hypertrophy can make itself known in a variety of ways. Most commonly, chest pain, either with or without exertion is present, along with shortness of breath with exertion, general fatigue, syncope, and palpitations. Overt signs of heart failure, such as edema, or shortness of breath without exertion are uncommon.\n\nHypertrophy of the ventricle can be measured with a number of techniques.\n\nElectrocardiogram (EKG), a non-invasive assessment of the electrical system of the heart, can be useful in determining the degree of hypertrophy, as well as subsequent dysfunction it may precipitate. Specifically, increase in Q wave size, abnormalities in the P wave as well as giant inverted T waves are indicative of significant concentric hypertrophy. Specific changes in repolarization and depolarization events are indicative of different underlying causes of hypertrophy and can assist in appropriate management of the condition. Changes are common in both eccentric and concentric hypertrophy, though are substantially different from one another. In either condition fewer than 10% of patients with significant hypertrophy display a normal EKG.\n\nTransthoracic echocardiography, a similarly non invasive assessment of cardiac morphology, is also important in determining both the degree of hypertrophy, underlying pathologies (such as aortic coarction), and degree of cardiac dysfunction. Important considerations in echocardiography of the hypertrophied heart include lateral and septal wall thickness, degree of outflow tract obstruction, and systolic anterior wall motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, which can exacerbate outflow obstruction.\n\nIt is not uncommon to undergo cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), which measures the heart's response to exercise, to assess the functional impairment caused by hypertrophy and to prognosticate outcomes.\n\nIn most situations, described above, the increase in ventricular wall thickness is a slow process. However, in some instances hypertrophy may be \"dramatic and rapid.\" In the Burmese python, consumption of a large meal is associated with an increase in metabolic work by a factor of seven and a 40% increase in ventricular mass within 48 hours, both of which return to normal within 28 days.\n\nAs described in the previous section, it is believed that the eccentric hypertrophy is induced by volume-overload and that the concentric hypertrophy is induced by pressure-overload. Biomechanical approaches have been adopted to investigate the progression of cardiac hypertrophy for these two different types.\n\nIn the framework of continuum mechanics, the volumetric growth is often modeled using a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient formula_1 into an elastic part formula_2 and a growth part formula_3, where formula_4. For the generic orthotropic growth, the growth tensor can be represented as\n\nformula_5,\n\nwhere formula_6 and formula_7 are normally the orthonormal vectors of the microstructure, and formula_8 is often referred as growth multipliers, which regulates the growth according to certain growth laws.\n\nIn eccentric growth, cardiomyocyte lengthens in the direction of the cell's long axis, formula_9. Therefore, the eccentric growth tensor can be expressed as\n\nformula_10,\n\nwhere formula_11 is the identity tensor.\n\nThe concentric growth, on the other hand, induces parallel deposition of the sarcomeres. The growth of cardiomyocyte is in the transverse direction, and thus the concentric growth tensor is expressed as:\n\nformula_12,\n\nwhere formula_13 is the vector perpendicular to tangent plane of the cardiac wall.\n\nThere are different hypothesis on the growth laws governing the growth multipliers formula_14 and formula_15. Motivated by the observation that eccentric growth is induced by volume-overload, strain-driven growth laws are applied to the formula_14. For the concentric growth, which is induced by pressure-overload, both stress-driven and strain-driven growth laws have been investigated and tested using computational finite element method. The biomechanical model based on continuum theories of growth can be used to predict the progression of the disease, and therefore can potentially help developing treatments to pathological hypertrophy.\n\n\n"}

A strong proponent of Anglo-American co-operation, he worked for many years as a professor at Cornell University and other universities and colleges in the United States and Canada. He preached the use of a natural science model for political science. McMaster University Libraries hold his correspondence archive and the body of some of his works. He had two children, one of whom is the politician and academic Shirley Williams.\n\nCatlin was born in Liverpool, the son of George Edward Catlin (1858-1936), an Anglican clergyman. He was educated at St Paul's School, and New College, Oxford. It was here that he converted to Roman Catholicism after his wartime hiatus.\n\nHe volunteered for military service in the early months of the First World War, but was rejected, and spent most of the war working for the liquor traffic department of the Central Control Board. However, he became a soldier in the last months of the war, fighting on the Western Front in Belgium.\n\nAfter the war he received his M.A. at Oxford and won three major prizes, including the Gladstone Prize and the Matthew Arnold prize in 1921 for his essay on the political thought of Thomas Hobbes entitled \"Thomas Hobbes as Philosopher, Publicist and Man of Letters\". He took up the relatively new field of political science. This was better established in the USA and at the invitation of the historian Wallace Notestein he began lecturing at Cornell University where he had the close association of Carl Becker. There he completed his doctoral thesis, published in 1926 entitled \"The Science and Method of Politics\". This was followed in 1929 by \"A Study of the Principles of Politics\". He was an Assistant Professor of Politics at Cornell by the age of 28 and subsequently twice Acting chairman. In 1926 he was appointed to be the director of the National Commission (Social Research Council) to study the impact of prohibition in the United States. His conclusions were subsequently published as a book.\n\nCatlin was a strong proponent of Anglo-American co-operation, even to the extent of advocating an organic union between the two countries. He published \"Anglo-Saxony and Its Tradition\" in 1939. He also had ambitions to be directly involved in British politics through the Labour Party.\n\nBetween 1928 and 1931 Catlin was attached to the personal staff of Sir Oswald Mosley. This was a period before Mosley had made his final break with the Labour Party to become openly fascist. In 1929 he assisted H.G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, and others in establishing \"The Realist\" magazine.\n\nCatlin was an unsuccessful Labour candidate in two general elections: 1931 in Brentford and Chiswick, and 1935 in Sunderland. From 1935 to 1937 he served on the executive committee of the Fabian Society.\n\nDuring the 1930s Catlin travelled extensively. He visited Germany, where in 1933 he witnessed the trial of Dimitrov for allegedly setting the Reichstag fire, a forewarning of what Nazism was to become. He went to Soviet Russia for a prolonged examination of the newly established Communist regime there and to Spain during the height of the Civil War. During this period Catlin wrote a large number of articles as a journalist, mostly for the \"Yorkshire Post\". He served on the campaign team of Presidential candidate Wendell Willkie during 1940 and his subsequent book, \"One Anglo-American Nation\" appeared in 1941. He was an early advocate for the independence of India, after meeting Mahatma Gandhi in 1931 in London. He visited India in 1946 and 1947 and published a tribute to Gandhi after his assassination, \"In the Path of Mahatma Gandhi\" (1948). In 1947 Catlin lectured in Peking. He served as Provost of Mar Ivanios College in India for 1953–54 and as chairman and Bronfman Professor in the Department of Economics and Political Science at McGill University between 1956 and 1960. He was a founder of the Movement for Atlantic Union, which was established in 1958. He drafted the constitution of the Paris-based Atlantic Institute, founded in 1961. He was also a member of the Pilgrims Club of Great Britain.\n\nHis autobiography, on which he had worked sporadically since the end of the First World War, was finally published in 1972 as \"For God's Sake, Go\". \n\nIn the 1970 Birthday Honours, Catlin was knighted for services to Anglo-American relations.\n\nCatlin married the English novelist Vera Brittain in 1925 after a courtship that began as a correspondence. She was pursuing her own career as a writer in Britain and the marriage endured many Atlantic-wide separations. They went on to have two children, John Edward Jocelyn Brittain-Catlin (1927–1987), whose memoirs, \"Family Quartet\", appeared in 1987; and British politician Shirley Williams (born 1930).\n\nAfter Vera Brittain's death in 1970, Catlin married Delinda Gates (1913-2002) in Chelsea, London in 1971.

He succeeded as 2nd Earl of Atholl on his father's demise in June 1642 and as 3rd Earl of Tullibardine after the death of his first cousin the 2nd Earl in 1670.\n\nMurray was the son of John Murray, 1st Earl of Atholl (cr. 1629) by his wife Jane, daughter of Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy. In 1650 he joined in the unsuccessful attempt to liberate Charles II from the Covenanters, and he was, in 1653, a chief supporter of the 8th Earl of Glencairn's rising to power in opposition to English plans to incorporate Scotland into the Commonwealth and devoted 2,000 men to the battle. He was eventually obliged to surrender the following year to George Monck, the victorious Commonwealth commander.\n\nIn 1660, Murray became a privy councillor for Scotland, obtained a charter of the hereditary office of sheriff of Fife, and in 1661 became Lord Justice-General of Scotland. In 1663 he was appointed Lord President of the Court of Session. Murray became the first captain-general of the Royal Company of Archers in 1670. in 1671 he became a Commissioner of the Exchequer, the following year Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland and on 14 January 1673 became an Extraordinary Lord of Session.\n\nIn 1670 he succeeded to the earldom of Tullibardine on the death of his cousin, the 4th Earl and was created Marquess of Atholl and Viscount Glenalmond on 7 February 1676.\nHe commissioned William Bruce for a rebuild of Dunkeld House in 1676. The house had been badly damaged in 1654, during the civil war, and Bruce was given the task of building its replacement.\n\nMurray was initially a supporter of the robust policies of Lord Lauderdale, taking part in a 1678 raid against the Covenanters, but he then temporarily lost royal favour by counselling moderation concerning the measures taken against them. In 1679, however, he was present at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge; in July 1680 he was made vice-admiral of Scotland, and in 1681 president of parliament.\n\nIn 1684 he was appointed lord-lieutenant of Argyll, fought vigorously against the 9th Earl of Argyll in Argyll's Rising of 1685 and was instrumental in defeating him. Murray was knighted in 1687.\n\nHe showed himself to be lukewarm to the accession of William III and waited on the event. Finally in April 1689 he wrote to William to declare his allegiance, and in May took part in the proclamation of William and Mary as king and queen at Edinburgh. But during Viscount Dundee's insurrection he allowed his troops to be used at the Battle of Killiecrankie against the supporters of the new king, which helped bring about the defeat of the government's troops. He was then summoned to London and imprisoned during August. In 1690 he was implicated in the Montgomery plot to restore James and subsequently in further Jacobite intrigues. In June 1691 he received a pardon, and acted later for the government in the pacification of the Highlands.\n\nIronically, given Murray's rumoured Jacobite leanings but public opposition to the group, his grandson, Lord George Murray became a famed general of the Jacobites and was responsible for their success throughout the greater part of the 1745 uprising.\n\nMurray was described by Lord Macaulay as \"the falsest, the most fickle, the most pusillanimous of mankind\", regarding Murray's indecisive position surrounding the succession of William of Orange and the deposition of King James.\"\n\nOn 5 May 1659, Lord Atholl married Lady Amelia Ann Sophia Stanley (1633-22 February 1702/1703), daughter of James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby and Charlotte de La Tremoille.

The species is only found in the rivers below above sea level in northern Tasmania, an island-state of Australia. It is listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List due to overfishing and habitat degradation, and it has been prohibited to catch the crayfish since 1998.\n\nThe diet of the freshwater crayfish varies with age, but predominantly consists of decaying wood, leaves and their associated microbes. They may also eat small fish, insects, rotting animal flesh and other detritus when available. \"A. gouldi\" is very long-lived, surviving for up to 60 years. It has previously been reported to attain weights of up to and measure over long; however, in recent years the majority of larger specimens are . When fully mature the species has no natural predators due to its large size, while smaller individuals can be prey of platypus, river blackfish and rakali.\n\nAlthough a crayfish, the species is locally known as the giant freshwater lobster. In Tasmanian Aboriginal language (palawa kani) the giant freshwater lobster is referred to as lutaralipina. Previously, it has been common to use ‘tayatea’ as the Aboriginal name for \"A. gouldi\". However, historical record does not support the use of this word for this species. The palawa kani Language Program of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre has revived ‘lutaralipina’ (pronounced: lu-tar-rah-lee-pee-nah) as the appropriate Tasmanian Aboriginal term for the giant freshwater crayfish (\"A. gouldi\"); and ‘tayatitja’ (pronounced: tie-yah-tee-tchah) for the small southern freshwater crayfish (\"A. franklinii\").\n\nThe specific epithet of the scientific name, \"Astacopsis gouldi\", honours the first Tasmanian Government Geological Surveyor Charles Gould (1834-1893), son of the 19th century English ornithologist John Gould and natural history illustrator Elizabeth Gould (née Coxen). Charles Gould was an amateur naturalist and member of the Royal Society of Tasmania who published observations on the giant freshwater lobster's distribution, diet and habits in 1870. \"Astacopsis gouldi\" was first formally described in 1936 by Ellen Clark, a naturalist specialising in Australia's crustaceans. Prior to Clark's revision in 1936, all three of Tasmania's large stream-dwelling crayfish of the genus \"Astacopsis\" were collectively known as \"Astacopsis franklinii\" in honour of the polar explorer and Governor of Van Diemen's Land Sir John Franklin. \"Astacopsis franklinii\" now refers only to the smaller southern species, while the medium sized western species is known as \"Astacopsis tricornis\" and \"Astacopis gouldi\" refers exclusively to the giant northern crayfish. It is a common misconception that \"A. gouldi\" is named after the convict artist William Buelow Gould. WB Gould's \"Sketchbook of fishes\" produced at the Macquarie Harbour penal settlement contains an image of the large western Tasmanian freshwater crayfish \"A. tricornis not A. gouldi\".\n\n\"A. gouldi\" are omnivorous crustacean, primarily eating decaying wood, leaves and their associated microbes. They may also eat small fish, insects, rotting animal flesh and other detritus when available. Colour varies considerably among individuals, with adults ranging from dark brown-green to black or blue. For undetermined reasons, populations in the Frankland River system on the West Coast are predominantly found to be blue-white in colour. Males can be identified by their larger pincers compared to females. Young juveniles moult several times a year, becoming less frequent as they mature. The species is long lived and known to live up to 60 years of age and attain weights of up to , however in recent years specimens of are considered large.\n\nResults from a genetic study indicated that specimens of \"A. gouldi\" from a site in the Pipers River catchment (north of Launceston) were significantly genetically distinct from the rest of the species.\n\nThe dispersal and migratory patterns of \"A. gouldi\" are largely unknown, but they are recorded to be most active during summer and autumn when water temperatures are higher, they are also known to walk over land. A 2004 study found the species appears to have periods of relative inactivity restricted to a \"home-pool\" for 1–10 days interspersed with movements involving travel over relatively large distances, including one crayfish moving over 700 m in a single night.\n\nJuveniles are suspected to migrate to seasonal creeks or shallow faster-flowing waters known as riffle zones where they are at less risk from predators including other crayfish, fish, platypus and rakali. Larger sub-adults (< carapace length) will move to deeper-flowing straight sections of the catchment. Adults have no natural predators and will take refuge in sheltered deep pools and appear to tolerate each other despite being aggressive elsewhere. Males are territorial and maintain a harem of up to several females.\n\nTasmanian giant freshwater crayfish have extremely slow maturation rates, with females reaching sexual maturity at approximately 14 years of age, a weight of and a carapace length of . Males are thought to reach maturity more quickly at around 9 years, and carapace length.\n\nFemales mate and spawn once every two years in autumn after a summer moult, producing 224–1300 eggs proportional to its size. Gestation of the eggs takes about nine months, with females carrying the eggs on their tail through winter. After hatching in mid-summer, the hatchlings of about attach to the female's swimming legs and will remain with the mother until a few months later in autumn. A long reproductive process means that females spend much of their life attached to their eggs and hatchlings.\n\n\"A. gouldi\" inhabit rivers and streams at elevations of approximately above sea level, with upper limits of . Approximately 18% of the waterways in which the species habitat is predicted to occur are protected in a formal reserve.\n\nFormerly, the species was distributed from the Arthur River in the west and eastwards across northern Tasmania, where it was found in all rivers flowing into Bass Strait, except for those of the Tamar catchment. Despite the two disjunct ranges, populations across these are genetically similar. The species has been introduced into the North Esk (St Patricks River) and the Derwent catchments where populations have become established. Today, distribution of \"A. gouldi\" is fragmented and limited to less disturbed areas. Large declines in numbers or localised extinctions are thought to have occurred in the Welcome, Montagu, Rubicon, Don, Brid, Boobyalla, Pipers, Ringarooma, Duck, Little and Great Forester Rivers and Claytons Rivulet. Eastern populations are particularly reduced.\n\n\"A. gouldi\" inhabit slow-moving rivers and streams of several sizes including headwaters and rivulets. Water should be of high quality with high dissolved oxygen content, little suspended sediment, and water temperatures between , although relatively low temperatures are preferred. Adults need still, deep pools with submerged decaying logs and overhanging, but not eroding, banks to shelter beneath. \nJuveniles prefer shallow, faster-flowing stream habitats with distinct cavities to hide under and higher portions of bolder substrate and moss cover.\n\nExcellent habitat requires intact, native riparian vegetation which is densely canopied and shades the waterways. However, the species has been recorded in confines of non-native riparian vegetation (e.g. pine plantations), without riparian vegetation and in farm dams. A 1994 study failed to find crayfish in waterways of established agricultural areas where all riparian vegetation had been removed.\n\nFishing for the giant freshwater crayfish was never a commercial proposition, and its slow growth and aggressive nature suggest that the species is not suitable for aquaculture. As an edible animal, they are further disadvantaged of being so spiny that they can cut hands if carelessly shelled after cooking, and they yield little meat relative to total weight. However, the striking nature of the species makes it a potential tourism drawcard.\n\nThe principal causes for the population declines of the Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish have been previous overfishing, continued illegal fishing and habitat disturbance by agricultural, forestry and urban activities. Experts estimate there are less than 100,000 remaining in the wild. Land clearing typically requires approval with a Forest Practices Plan and 10m streamside buffers. Until recently, buffer zones only prohibited machinery operating near waterways with harvesting and burning permitted up to the stream edge.\n\n\"A. gouldi\" is protected under the federal government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and Tasmanian state government Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 which prohibit the fishing or handling of the species without permit. The effectiveness of some current conservation efforts are not fully determined and are subject to review in the 2016 Recovery Plan. Population surveys and behavioural research are being undertaken in order to be able to provide improved habitat management and protection.\n\nThe relative ease of catch, slow maturation (14 years for females), infrequent breeding (once every 2 years) and the removal of young when females are caught make \"A. gouldi\" highly susceptible to human fishing pressures. The larger individuals were targeted for eating and trophies, which has had a significant effect on breeding stock, completely removing populations from some river systems. The lack of any bag limit until the 1990s allowed overfishing to occur for many years.\n\nIn 1998, the species was listed as \"vulnerable\" under Australian law and an amendment to the Inland Fisheries Act 1995 made it illegal to catch or handle \"A. gouldi\" without a permit, carrying a maximum fine of A$10,000. Although past fishing pressures are believed to have had a significant impact on populations, a degree of illegal fishing is known to continue and has potential to significantly threaten the remaining populations. The level of illegal fishing is not fully known, but is evidenced by prosecutions, the presence of bait lines and anecdotal reports. New developments of roads and forestry tracks can consequentially allow illegal fishers to access previously unexploited populations.\n\nHabitat disturbance for \"A. gouldi\" includes the removal or destruction of native riparian vegetation, bank erosion, removal of , stream flow alterations such as culverts and farm dams, siltation and toxic chemical runoffs.\n\nThe clearance of riparian vegetation causes the destabilisation of waterway banks, which impacts the burrowing habitats for \"A. gouldi\" and increases sediment runoff into waterways. Increased sediment levels arising from agricultural and forestry related land-uses have been correlated with decreased abundances of freshwater crayfish. The increase in turbidity impacts the ability of the crayfish to effectively transpire oxygen through its gills. Sediment depositions arising from upstream forestry operations have been observed to impact in-stream habitat for considerable distances downstream of up to 10 km. Loss of riparian canopy cover allows more light to reach the water and has a negative impact on habitat by increasing water temperatures.\n\nWhile Tasmanian river basins have been found to be generally less impacted by flow alterations than other catchments across Australia, some river basins (such as the Mersey and Pipers–Ringarooma river basins) are heavily impacted by hydro-electric schemes, with the use of in-stream barriers reducing the dispersal potential of the crayfish. Water extraction for irrigated agriculture and urban water use is of concern to a lesser degree, however there has been an identified lack of contingency plans in the event of reduced environmental flows in waterways. Anecdotal reports indicate that low environmental flows caused the death of giant freshwater crayfish in several catchments in the north-west and north-east of Tasmania in 2006–07\n\nIn 1994, a large spill from a holding dam at a pyrethrum extraction plant caused a major kill in the Hogarth Rivulet and the main channel of the Great Forester River. Reports from locals and fisheries officers suggested that there was little life left in much of the main channel, and the incident is believed to have severely harmed any populations that were in the waterways at the time of the spill.\n\nThe 2016 Tasmanian floods, which killed 3 people, raised concerns about the future for the Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish after up to 100 carcasses were found washed up along the banks of the Leven River on a property in North West Tasmania, likely caused by the high water flows during the flood. Previous population surveys in the area had revealed already low numbers. There are further concerns that the floods displaced from waterways which are a vital part of the habitat for the species.\n\nThe \"2006–2010 Giant Freshwater Lobster Recovery Plan\" highlighted several catchments (or parts of) which had been identified to contain good habitat quality and good crayfish populations and should be considered for conservation efforts. Some areas require renewed evaluation since habitat quality may have changed since surveys were conducted. North-eastern Tasmanian rivers lacked sufficient data to fully determine all areas of importance.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Later in the year he returned, accompanied by King Harald Hardrada of Norway at the head of a huge Norwegian army, which defeated Edwin and Morcar at the Battle of Fulford near York (September 20). Harald and Tostig were in turn defeated and slain by Harold Godwinson's army, five days later at the Battle of Stamford Bridge (September 25). After Harold's death at the Battle of Hastings, where Edwin and Morcar were absent, they were the principal supporters of a new regime under Edgar the Ætheling, though they had wished the public to elect one of them king, but failed to take effective steps against the invading Normans and soon submitted to Duke William.\n\nIn 1068, Edwin and Morcar attempted to raise a rebellion in Mercia but swiftly submitted when William moved against them.

In the Byzantine era its name was Dorylaeum. The urban population of the city is 717,135 with a metropolitan population of 826,135. The city is located on the banks of the Porsuk River, 792 m above sea level, where it overlooks the fertile Phrygian Valley. In the nearby hills one can find hot springs. The city is to the west of Ankara, to the southeast of Istanbul and to the northeast of Kütahya. Known as a university town, both Eskişehir Osmangazi University and Anadolu University (which has one of the largest student enrollments in the world) are based in Eskişehir. The province covers an area of .\n\nThe name Eskişehir literally means \"Old City\" in Turkish. The city was founded by the Phrygians in at least 1000 BC, although it has been estimated to be older than 4000 years old. The current city lies about a mile from the ancient Phyrgian city of Dorylaeum. Many Phrygian artifacts and sculptures can still be found in the city's archeological museum. There is also a museum of meerschaum stone, whose production remains still notable, used to make high quality meerschaum pipes. In the fourth century AD the city moved about ten km northeast, from Karacahisar to Şehirhöyük.\n\nMany ancient geographers described the city as one of the most beautiful in Anatolia.\n\nAs with many towns in Anatolia, Christianity arrived after Constantine the Great legalized the religion in the Roman Empire. Beginning in the 4th century, records exist of bishops holding office in Eskişehir. The city was known as \"Dorylaeum\" (Δορύλαιον) in Greek in that period. One of these bishops, Eusebius, was heavily involved in shaping the evolving dogma of the church.\n\nIt was called during the Seljuk period. In 1097 it was the site of a battle in which the First Crusade defeated Kilij Arslan I; the town later fell to the Turks in 1176.\n\nTraditionally dependent on flour milling and brickyards, the city expanded with the building of railway workshops in 1894 for work on the Berlin-Baghdad Railway.\n\nAs of 1920, Eskişehir was one of the major locations for meerschaum mining. At that time, most of the mining sites were owned by the state.\n\nDevrim, the first Turkish automobile, was produced in 1961 at the TÜLOMSAŞ factory in Eskişehir. Devrim never put into mass production and stayed a concept study and can be viewed in TÜLOMSAŞ factory Eskişehir. In addition to production, first Turkish steam powered locomotive called Karakurt was produced at the TÜLOMSAŞ in 1961.\nEskişehir was also the site of Turkey's first aviation industry (Aeronautical Supply Maintenance Centre) and its air base was the command center of Turkey's first Tactical Air Force headquarters on NATO's southern flank during the Cold War.\n\nEskişehir produces trucks, home appliances, railway locomotives, fighter aircraft engines, agricultural equipment, textiles, brick, cement, chemicals, processed meerschaum and refined sugar. , one of Turkey's largest food brands (mostly producing biscuit, chocolate and candy varieties) is based in Eskişehir. Arçelik, a major Turkish home appliances and consumer electronics manufacturer, has one of its production plants in Eskişehir. Eskişehir was the first stage of High-speed rail in Turkey from Ankara. This service improved the travel and commerce between Eskişehir and Ankara, thanks to reduced journey time. GKN, a major global automotive supplier for passenger and commercial car powertrain systems has a plant in Eskişehir.\n\nThe city is served by the Anadolu Airport.\n\nThere are three universities in Eskişehir. These are the Anadolu University, Eskişehir Osmangazi University and the Eskişehir Technical University. In addition to its on-campus study offering, Anadolu university started open university courses through TV broadcast already in the 1980s, allowing access to thousands of students who otherwise would not have been able to benefit from tertiary education. The current Metropolitan Mayor of Eskişehir, Prof. Dr. Yılmaz Büyükerşen, was formerly the rector of the Anadolu University.\n\nThe city has a significant population of Turkic Crimean Tatars. It also attracted ethnic Turks emigrating from Balkan countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Bosnia, Macedonia and the Sandžak region of Serbia, who contributed to the development of the city's metalworking industries.\nEskişehir also hosted the inaugural Turkvision Song Contest in 2013, which aims to highlight music and artists from various Turkic-speaking regions. The city is also home to the Dünya Müzeleri Müzesi or Museum of World Museums.\n\nOther museums in the city are Eti Archaeology Museum, Aviation Museum, Meerschaum Museum, Museum of Independence, Museum of Modern Glass Art, Tayfun Talipoğlu Typewriter Museum, Yılmaz Büyükerşen Wax Museum and the Odunpazarı Modern Museum.\n\nMost of modern-day Eskişehir was rebuilt after the Turkish War of Independence (1919–1923), but a number of historic buildings remain, such as the Kurşunlu Mosque. The archaeological site of the ancient Phrygian city of Dorylaeum is close to Eskişehir. The city is noted for its natural hot sulphur springs.\n\nEskişehir has a highly continental warm-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csb) under the Köppen climate classification, with the city bordering on a dry-summer humid continental climate of both the warm-summer and hot-summer subtypes, a hot-summer mediterranean climate and, due to low precipitation, a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: Dsa, Dsb, Csa, BSk). The city features cold, snowy winters and warm, dry summers. Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn. Due to Eskişehir's high altitude and its dry summers, nightly temperatures in the summer months are cool.

It is home to Durham County Cricket Club, and has also hosted several international matches.\n\nDurham's acceptance into first-class cricket in 1991 was made conditional on the building of a new Test match-standard cricket ground. Work began on the new ground at the Riverside in a location overlooked by Lumley Castle in 1990, with development continuing in phases. Work on the outfield and playing surface began in 1993. In its first three seasons in the County Championship, the Club played in a variety of locations around the county, but the Riverside ground was pronounced ready for cricket in time for the 1995 season, even though many of the buildings were still temporary or unfinished. The ground hosted its first game, Durham \"vs.\" Warwickshire, on 18 May 1995.\n\nOther facilities at the ground continued being built over subsequent years, and the club's Don Robson Pavilion was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1996. The full ground capacity, including permanent and temporary seating, is 17,000.\n\nIn September 2008 plans were announced concerning further developments to the ground. These included installing permanent floodlights, and extending the County Durham stand so that permanent seating surrounds the entire ground, raising the ground capacity to around 20,000. A new entrance building was also planned to house the box office and club shop, as well as offices for club officials, a new perimeter road and a hotel. These developments were seen as a necessity, as the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have specified that they must take place in order for the ground to secure its status as a venue for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.\n\nIn April 2015, planning permission was granted to erect six permanent 55-metre floodlights around the ground.

In 2001 a One-Day International between Australia and Pakistan was abandoned without a ball bowled due to rain.\n\n2003 saw the Riverside Ground raised to Test match status; it has hosted six England Test matches: against Zimbabwe in 2003, Bangladesh in 2005, West Indies in 2007 and 2009, Australia in 2013 and Sri Lanka in 2016. The fourth day of the West Indies Test, 18 June 2007, saw Paul Collingwood hitting a century on his home pitch for England against the West Indies, and so becoming the first local Durham player to hit a Test century at the Riverside.\n\nIt was announced in July 2009 that the ground would host the fourth Ashes Test match of the 2013 Ashes series, the culmination of Durham's growth as a First Class County since 1992 coming after Durham missed out to Cardiff in its bid to host an Ashes test in 2009. Hosting an Ashes Test match was predicted to generate £20 million for the local economy.\n\nThe first scheduled Twenty20 International at the ground, against South Africa in 2008, was abandoned due to heavy rain. In 2012 South Africa returned for the Riverside Ground's second Twenty20 match, defeating England by 7 wickets, in a match held alongside a women's T20I against the West Indies. A second T20I double header was hosted in August 2013, where England defeated Australia in both men's and women's matches. The women's match formed the final encounter of the 2013 women's Ashes series.\n\nFurther international matches held at the Riverside Ground included two ODI matches, against Sri Lanka in 2014 and New Zealand in 2015, and a Test match against Sri Lanka held in 2016.\n\nAs part of the conditions of a package of financial support announced in October 2016, the ECB imposed a number of sanctions on Durham County Cricket Club, including removal of the club's eligibility to bid to stage Test cricket at the Riverside Ground.

{"id": "2311668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311668", "title": "Free Dominion", "text": "Free Dominion\n\nFree Dominion was a Canadian conservative internet forum. The site used the phrase \"Principled Conservativism\" to describe its ideology.\n\nThe lead moderators and former owners of the site were Mark and Connie Fournier.\nMark Fournier ran in the 2007 Ontario election for the Freedom Party of Ontario in Kingston and the Islands placing last with 137 votes (0.28%).\n\nOn December 31, 2005, Free Dominion made news when one of its frequent contributors, Gordon Stamp, resigned as Peter Goldring's campaign manager as a result of comments Stamp had posted on Free Dominion about being open to Alberta separatism under certain circumstances. Goldring was subsequently quoted saying that Free Dominion is \"extreme\" in its views.\n\nIn early 2008, the website was sold to Liberty News Service in Panama, with the Fourniers retaining operational control of the website.\n\nIn July 2007, a complaint was made against Free Dominion before the Canadian Human Rights Commission for posting material perceived to be discriminatory against Muslims. The complaint was subsequently withdrawn.\n\nFree Dominion and Connie and Mark Fournier have been defendants in a total of four lawsuits for defamation.\n\nAmong the suits against Free Dominion and the Fourniers were four filed by Richard Warman, a human rights lawyer. Three of the suits were for defamation and an additional unsuccessful suit was for copyright infringement. Of the three defamation suits, two have proceeded towards trial while a third, filed with Warren Kinsella as co-plaintiff, has been inactive.\n\nIn 2008, Warman sued the Fourniers and eight John Does for libel. As part of this case, Warman asked the court to order the Fourniers to release information which could assist in the identification of the eight John Does: their email addresses and IP addresses. Justice Kershman ordered them to do so. However on appeal, the Superior Court overturned this decision unless Warman could prove a \"prima facie\" case against the John Does before their information was released.\n\nOn August 9, 2013, the case finally began with jury selection. After 10 days of testimony, the jury was charged. On October 2, 2013, the jury found that Warman was maliciously defamed by 41 statements made on the website and awarded him $42,000 in damages, plus costs which were later set at $85,000. Superior Court Justice Robert Smith banned the site from republishing \"in any form whatsoever,\" any of the 41 defamatory statements. Smith wrote in his decision that: \"The continued publication of libellous material would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiff’s reputation and prohibited material has already been found to constitute libel.\" Smith wrote that as the jury found the defendants made the comments about Warman \"maliciously\" and refused to apologize, \"I find that the plaintiff has met his onus of showing that an injunction should issue to prevent the defendants from publishing in any manner whatsoever any statements found to be defamatory of Mr. Warman in this action as set out in jury Exhibit J\". As a result of the permanent injunction the Fourniers decided to close the Free Dominion forum to the public. On December 11, 2015, a panel of 3 justices of the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the lower court's ruling and awarded Warman an additional $23,000 in costs. The site has been offline since the day the appeal decision was issued.\n\nIn April 2008, Warman filed an additional libel suit against the Fourniers and Free Dominion as well as the \"National Post\" columnist Jonathan Kay as well as the newspaper itself, and bloggers Ezra Levant, Kathy Shaidle and Kate McMillan of the Small Dead Animals blog for repeating allegations that Warman was the author of a 2003 internet post regarding Canadian Senator Anne Cools that used racist and sexist epithets. Warman denied that he was the author of the post. The \"National Post\" and Kay apologized, retracted the statement and settled out of court with Warman.\n\nIn June 2015, Shaidle, Levant and McMillan all settled with Warman in exchange for paying him undisclosed amounts and the issuing public retractions and apologies in which they admitted there was no evidence that the allegations against Warmn were true, leaving the Fourniers as the sole remaining defendants. The trial is pending.\n\nOttawa writer and former union official John Baglow, who blogs as \"Dr. Dawg\", filed suit against the Fourniers and Free Dominion participant Roger Smith over a post in which Smith referred to Baglow as \"one of the Taliban’s more vocal supporters.\" In a March 2015 ruling, Madam Justice Heidi Polowin found the words to be defamatory and also rejected claims by the Fourniers that they were not publishers and not legally responsible for words posted by others on the Free Dominion forum stating that \"To adopt the position of the defendants would leave potential plaintiffs with little ability to correct reputational damage,\" however she dismissed the suit ruling that in context of \"rough and tumble\" debate in the blogosphere the words, while defamatory, could be accepted as \"fair comment\". The judge awarded no costs to either side as \"both sides were successful and unsuccessful\".\n\n"}

It replaced the \"Web of Spider-Man\" series.\n\nThe initial seven issues (#0–6, January–July 1996) were written and pencilled by Dan Jurgens, who had helped revive interest in Superman for DC Comics in the mid-1990s. Jurgens pushed strongly for the restoration of Peter Parker as the true Spider-Man and plans were made to enact this soon, but Bob Harras, the new Editor-in-chief, demanded the story be deferred until after the \"Onslaught\" crossover. Jurgens had by this stage become disillusioned with the immense amount of group planning and constant changes of ideas and directions and took this as the last straw, resigning from the title.\n\nHe was succeeded by writer Todd DeZago and penciller Mike Wieringo, who remained as the title's regular creative team for the remainder of its run.

{"id": "2311682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311682", "title": "John Lawrence Toole", "text": "John Lawrence Toole\n\nJohn Lawrence (J. L.) Toole (12 March 1830 – 30 July 1906) was an English comic actor, actor-manager and theatrical producer. He was famous for his roles in farce and in serio-comic melodramas, in a career that spanned more than four decades, and the first actor to have a West End theatre named after him.\n\nToole was born in London, the younger son of James Toole and his wife, Elizabeth. His father was a messenger for the East India Company and for some years an usher at the Old Bailey, who for many years in the 1840s acted as toastmaster in the City of London.\n\nHe was educated at the City of London School from 1841–45, and started work as a clerk in a wine merchant's office. In 1854, Toole married Susan Hale (née Caslake), a widow five years older than he. They had a son, Frank Lawrence, and a daughter, Florence Mabel, but both children died in their 20s.\n\nToole began his acting career by training as an amateur with the City Histrionic Club, beginning in 1850 and by performing in other amateur theatricals and in comic sketches. He earned good notices, particularly as Jacob Earwig in \"Boots at the Swan\", and soon met Charles Dickens, who had heard of him and came to see him act. His last amateur role was as Simmons in \"The Spitalfields Weaver\" by Thomas Haynes Bayly at the Haymarket Theatre. Encouraged by Dickens, he made his professional stage debut in 1852 at the Queen's Theatre in Dublin, under the management of Charles Dillon, and by 1853 became the principal \"low comedian\" at the Theatre Royale in Edinburgh. His older brother, Francis, acted as his manager throughout his early career. During the next two years, he performed widely in Ireland and Scotland, gaining a reputation for sunny extemporaneous comedy, humorous expressions and a uniquely comic voice, freedom with his texts, and an engaging rapport with audiences.\n\nIn 1854, Toole made his first professional appearance in London at the St. James's Theatre, acting as Samuel Pepys in \"The King's Rival\", by Tom Taylor and Charles Reade, and Weazel in \"My Friend the Major\" by Selby. There he also played in \"Boots at the Swan\" and \"Honours before Titles\". He returned to the provinces, but by 1856 was engaged in London at the Lyceum Theatre, including as Hilarion Fanfaronade in \"Belphegor\", in which Marie Wilton made her first London appearance. Thereafter, he frequently performed with Wilton. In 1857, having had a great success in London as Paul Pry in John Poole's farce of that name, he made his first of many successful provincial summer tours and often repeated the character thereafter. During this first tour, he met and acted together with Henry Irving, and the two remained close friends over their long careers. In 1858, he scored a notable hit creating the role of Tom Cranky in John Hollingshead's farce \"The Birthplace of Podgers.\"\n\nIn 1858, at the suggestion of Dickens, Toole joined Benjamin Webster's company at the Adelphi Theatre and established his popularity as a farceur, creating, among other parts, Joe Spriggins in \"Ici on parle français\" by T. H. Williams, Augustus de Rosherville in \"The Willow Copse\" by Boucicault, in \"Birthplace of Podgers\", Tom Dibbles in \"Good for Nothing\" by J. B. Buckstone, and in \"Bengal Tiger\". He remained at the Adelphi as principal low comedian for nine years, frequently partnering with Paul Bedford, whose sedate comic style complemented his own contrasting energetic style. His most successful roles there included Bob Cratchit in \"A Christmas Carol\" (1859), the title role in \"Asmodeus\" in 1859, Peter Familias in \"The Census\" by William Brough (among many pieces by Brough), Milwood in \"George de Barnwell\" by H. J. Byron (1862), Caleb Plummer in \"Dot\" (1862), by Dion Boucicault, Pitcher in \"The Area Belle\" (1864), and Prudent in \"The Fast Family\" by B. Webster, Jr. His other great successes there were as Mr. Tetterby in an adaptation of Dickens' \"The Haunted Man\" and of a frightened servant in Boucicault's \"The Phantom\". He played a season in 1867 with the impressive new company at Queen's Theatre that included Irving, Henrietta Hodson, Lionel Brough and Charles Wyndham, where he appeared in such works a H. J. Byron's \"Dearer Than Life\", as Michael Garner, and W. S. Gilbert's \"La Vivandière\", as Sergeant Sulpizio. Frederick Waddy wrote of Toole in 1873 that as Harry Coke in \"Off the Line\", \"Mr. Toole makes one of those perfect pictures of everyday life of the lower class in which he has so often proved himself a consummate artist. But in low comedy and broad farce it would be difficult to find an actor of equal merit... As Paul Pry he keeps his audience in a roar whenever he is on the stage\".\n\nToole was then engaged in 1868 at the Gaiety Theatre by Hollingshead, appearing in many pieces there including \"Thespis\" (1871), the first Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration, and as John Lockwood, in a drama called \"Wait and Hope\". In 1872–74, among other successes, he portrayed Tom Larkin in \"Good News\" by H. J. Byron, the Irishman Brulgruddery in \"John Bull\" by George Colman the Younger; Bob Acres in \"The Rivals\" by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, together with Charles James Mathews and Samuel Phelps; the title role in a Robert Reece burlesque called \"Don Giovanni in Venice\"; another title role in \"Guy Fawkes\" by H. J. Byron, and created the role of the barrister Hammond Coote in \"Wig and Gown\" by James Albery. Toole's fame was at its height in 1874, when he went on tour to America, but he failed to reproduce there the success he had found in England. He remained based mostly at the Gaiety until the end of 1877, when he moved to the Globe Theatre under his own management for two years.\n\nIn 1878, Toole created the role of Charles Liquorpond in \"A Fool and his Money\" by H. J. Byron. Liquorpond was a retired footman unexpectedly overtaken by wealth, and Toole's affectedly superior pronunciation, particularly of his own name, was a tremendous success. In his prime, Toole achieved wide popularity as a comic actor, being noted for his comic delivery of words, but he did not confine himself exclusively to comedy. He also excelled in domestic melodramas (adaptations by Dion Boucicault and others of Charles Dickens and similar writers), playing \"tender-hearted victims of fate\", where he was famously able to combine humour and pathos. \"The Times\" said of his performance in \"Dearer than Life\" by Henry James Byron: \nIn 1879, Toole realized a lifelong ambition by taking over the management of the Folly Theatre in London. This triumph was offset by the death of his son in the same year, after a football injury. He renamed the theatre \"Toole's Theatre\" in 1882, becoming the first actor to have a West End theatre named after him. He was often away in the provinces, but he produced here a number of plays:\n\n\nToole began to be troubled by gout in 1886. After his daughter died in 1888, followed by his wife in 1889, Toole was disconsolate, and his health deteriorated further. By this time, his acting was unfashionable: he began to be seen as the last of the line of old-fashioned low comic actors who had been popular earlier in the century, including Buckstone, John Liston and Edward Richard Wright. Nevertheless, he toured Australia and New Zealand in 1890. He published his reminiscences in 1888, and his stage appearances gradually became fewer. The gout left him sometimes unable to walk, and after an 1893 illness during \"Thoroughbred\" by Ralph Lumley, he retired from the London stage, although he made occasional appearances in the provinces until about 1896. His theatre was demolished in 1895 for an extension of Charing Cross Hospital, and he dissolved his theatre company after an 1896 tour.\n\nThe critic Clement Scott called Toole \"one of the kindest and most genial men who ever drew breath. ... No one acted with more spirit or enjoyed so thoroughly the mere pleasure of acting.\" His genial and sympathetic nature was conspicuous off the stage as well as on it, and he was known as a great practical joker.\n\nUltimately he retired to Brighton, where after a long struggle with Bright's disease and a degenerative spinal illness, he died in 1906 at the age of 76. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery in London, next to his wife and children. Toole was a good businessman and left a considerable fortune of over £81,000, out of which he made a number of bequests to charity, to needy actors and to his friends.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hortência was a teen idol to many female basketball fans in the cities where she played, particularly at Prudentina where, during an interview with Jeremy Larner, she was stopped many times by autograph seekers on her way from her house to a game. \n\nHortência's first international experience came in 1976, when Brazil's women's national basketball team won the South American juvenile championship in Paraguay. In 1979, she helped her team to a fourth place at the Pan American Games held in Puerto Rico. In 1983, Hortência and the national team improved their previous Pan American performance by winning a bronze medal at the Venezuela games, while in 1987 Hortência and the Brazilian Women's national team went one step further by winning a silver medal at the 1987 Indianapolis Pan American Games. In 1991, Hortência and the Brazilian women's national basketball team won the gold medal at that year's Pan American tournament held in Cuba. In 1992, Hortência helped her team to a bronze medal at the Pre-Olympic competition held in Spain, returning later that year to that country to play in the Olympic Games for the first time. Brazil settled for seventh place at the Barcelona Olympics.\n\nFinally in 1994, Hortência won the women's world basketball championship in Australia, making Brazil the only country other than the Soviet Union or the United States to win the title (Australia became the fourth in 2006). The semi-final game against the USA is considered one of the greatest in history, and Brazil shocked the world with the victory. After the silver medal in the next Olympic Games, Marcari retired from international competition.\n\nApart from those competitions, she also played in Peru, Singapore, Malaysia, Bulgaria and South Korea.\n\nDespite the fact her team did not qualify for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, Hortência was featured on those games' official program, in an article named \"The Queen\".\n\nOn 5 August 2016, she became the penultimate torch bearer for the 2016 Summer Olympics torch relay, being the link between Gustavo Kuerten who brought the torch into the Olympic Stadium, and the cauldron lighter, Vanderlei de Lima, during the Opening Ceremonies.\n\nHer son, João Victor, participated in dressage competitions at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n"}

She is also a non-executive director of the Berkeley Group and an independent Director of Times Newspapers Holdings.\n\nPrior to this she was the editor of the \"Evening Standard\" (2002–2009) and previously deputy editor of \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\nWadley was born in Chelsea and educated at the independent Francis Holland School in central London and at Benenden School in Kent. She was employed by Condé Nast (1971–74), working on \"Vogue\", before travelling to South Africa where she worked as a journalist for three years. She subsequently joined \"The Daily Telegraph\" colour magazine (1978–81) and \"The Mail on Sunday\" for five years before rejoining \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 1986 remaining there until 1996, being appointed deputy editor in 1994.

She was the first female editor of the paper. During her seven years at the \"Standard\" she championed the arts and chaired the Evening Standard Theatre awards and Film awards. After Alexander Lebedev acquired the \"Standard\" in 2009, he replaced her with former \"Tatler\" editor Geordie Greig.\n\nThe newspaper was particularly critical of the then London Mayor, Ken Livingstone. This came to a head in the run-up to the 2008 London mayoral election, in which Wadley's newspaper attacked Livingstone's record. According to articles in \"The Guardian\" and \"Time Out\" London, she was strongly influenced by the need to renew Associated Newspaper's multimillion-pound contract to deliver the \"Metro\" free paper in London Underground stations in 2010, a decision within the gift of the Mayor. A few months after Wadley left the \"Standard\", the publication launched its \"Sorry\" promotion. \"London is laughing at this ludicrous campaign\", she claimed.\"The Guardian\" reported \"The market research evidently discovered that Londoners considered the \"Standard\" to be too negative.\n\nAs chair of Arts Council London, Wadley acts as an advocate and ambassador for the Arts Council to champion, support and develop art and culture across the city.

She oversaw the delivery of youth volunteering and employment programmes and co-ordinated the Mayor's relationship with London's diverse charities. She also developed new strategy for business relationships and sponsorship for the Greater London Authority.\n\nWadley has been heavily involved in promoting and supporting music and the arts in London. She has also been involved in raising funds for a several charities. She is a Founder Trustee of the London Music Fund (formerly the Mayor of London's Fund for Young Musicians, an independent charity supporting music education for children from low income families in London) and was its Chair from 2012 to 2016. She is also a Governor of the Yehudi Menuhin School (2012–present). The school develops the musical potential of exceptionally gifted young musicians. Since 2009, she has been an advisor at Greenhouse Sports. Greenhouse is a charity set up in 2002 to provide sports programmes for London secondary schools and academies in areas if high unemployment.

He had a distinguished academic and legal career culminating in his appointment as Queen's Advocate-General. Twiss was particularly noted for his contribution to the theory of international law. He was widely consulted, and was asked to draw up the constitution of the Congo Free State. A prolific author, Twiss wrote many influential textbooks on legal matters.\n\nHis public career came to a sudden end in 1872 after a scandal involving his wife Marie. He continued to research and publish on aspects of international law.\n\nTwiss was born in Marylebone in London. He was the eldest son of the Rev. Robert Twiss. At University College, Oxford, he obtained a first-class degree in mathematics and a second in classics in 1830, and was elected a Fellow of his college, of which he was afterwards successively bursar, dean and tutor. During his connection with Oxford, he was, \"inter alia\", a public examiner in classics and mathematics, Drummond Professor of Political Economy (1842), and Regius Professor of Civil Law (1855). In 1862 he married Marie von Lynnseele. Marriage required him to forfeit his fellowship. In compensation he was elected to an Honorary Fellowship of University College.\n\nHe published while at Oxford an epitome of Niebuhr's \"History of Rome\", an annotated edition of Livy and other works, but his studies mainly lay in the direction of political economy, law, chiefly international law, and international politics.\n\nHe was professor of international law at King's College London (1852–1855).\n\nIn 1840, he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and became an advocate at Doctors' Commons. In the ecclesiastical courts he enjoyed a large practice, and filled many of the appointments incidental thereto, such as commissary-general of the city and diocese of Canterbury (1849), vicar-general to the archbishop (1852) and Chancellor of the diocese of London (1858). In 1858, when the Probate and Divorce Acts of 1857 came into force, and the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Doctors' Commons had died, Twiss, like many other leading advocates of Doctors' Commons, became a QC, and in the same year was also elected a bencher of his Inn.\n\nHis successful career continued in the civil courts, and in addition to his large practice he was appointed in 1862 Advocate-General to the Admiralty, and in 1867 Queen's Advocate-General. In 1867, he was also knighted. He served during his legal career upon a great number of royal commissions, such as the Maynooth Commission in 1854, and others dealing with marriage law, neutrality, naturalisation and allegiance. His reputation abroad led to his being invited in 1884 by Leopold II, king of the Belgians, to draw up the constitution of the Congo Free State.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1838.\n\nIn 1871, Twiss became involved in an unpleasant scandal, which brought his career to an end. In 1862 he had married the 22-year-old Marie van Lynnseele, who he presented as the daughter of a Polish aristocrat. A solicitor named Alexander Chaffers claimed that Marie was in reality a French former prostitute who went by the name \"Marie Gelas\", and had been Twiss's mistress before their marriage. Chaffers, who also claimed to have been one of her lovers, was allegedly blackmailing her, sending her bills for imaginary \"services rendered\", which she initially paid. When she refused to pay any more, Chaffers made a statutory declaration about her, which he sent to various bishops and to the Lord Chamberlain. Charges of libel were brought against Chaffers, but were dropped when Marie Twiss broke down under ruthless cross-examination by Chaffers and then fled the country. Twiss was humiliated. He resigned from all his appointments and lived in retirement in London until his death. He never again saw his wife. Chaffers' subsequent vexatious litigation led to the passing of the Vexatious Actions Act in 1896. \n\nTwiss continued to research and publish on aspects of international law and kindred topics. Among his more notable publications of this period were \"The Law of Nations in Peace\" and \"The Law of Nations in War\".\n\nPublished works, written by Travers Twiss are:\n\n\n"}

The panel was first established in April 2002 when the ICC decided to reform the way that international cricket was umpired. The main change was that both umpires in a Test match and one of the umpires in a One Day International are now independent of the competing nations, whereas before 2002 just one of the umpires in a Test was independent and in ODIs both umpires were from the home nation. The majority of these ICC appointments are fulfilled by the members of the Elite Panel, who are generally thought to be the best umpires in the world. As such the ICC hopes to ensure that umpiring standards are as high as possible. Members of the panel stand in around 10 Tests and 15 ODIs each year. The list of umpires in the panel is revised every year by the ICC Umpires Selection Panel.\n\nThe panel was formed in 2002 with eight members. Peter Willey was invited to be on the panel, but declined the opportunity because it would have required him to spend too much time away from his family. The last members of the original panel were removed in 2011. The original eight panel members were:- Steve Bucknor, Daryl Harper, Ashoka de Silva, Srinivas Venkataraghavan, Rudi Koertzen, Dave Orchard, David Shepherd and Russell Tiffin.\n\nMembers of the International Panel of ICC Umpires stand in ODIs in their home countries, and may be appointed by the ICC to Tests and ODIs as an independent official at busy times in the cricket calendar to supplement the Elite Panel.

In July 2019, Michael Gough and Joel Wilson were added to the Elite panel following the retirement of Ian Gould and exclusion of Sundaram Ravi after the 2019 Cricket World Cup.\n\n, Australia and England have jointly provided the most members of the panel with seven.

Darrell Hair, who joined the panel in 2003, was banned from officiating in matches involving full ICC members following the Ball tampering controversy in August 2006. In March 2008, following a spell officiating associate members, Hair was once again permitted to umpire full members, but in August he handed in his resignation after he was only allowed to officiate in two tests.\n\nSteve Bucknor retired in 2009, having stood in a record 128 Tests since March 1989.

The current A303 is just south of the village.\n\nAbout 1 mile west-north-west of the parish church, situated between the disused railway line and the disused Chard Canal, is a moated site which is all that remains of the medieval fortified manor house of Merryfield (or Muryfield), which was the seat of the ancient Wadham family. The last of the family in the direct male line was Nicholas Wadham who, with his wife Dorothy Petre, founded Wadham College, Oxford in 1610. \n\nMonuments to the Wadham family survive in the Church of St Peter, Ilton and also in the nearby Church of St Mary, Ilminster. The three sisters of Nicholas Wadham were (in their issue) his heirs, one of whom was Florence Wadham (died 1596), wife of Sir John Wyndham of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset, and mother of Sir John Wyndham (1558-1645). \n\nThe Wyndham family, which later commonly used the first name \"Wadham\", inherited the estate of Merryfield and the \"Wyndham Estate\" is still today the largest employer in the village of Ilton.

He came to England as a historian. His lectures were seen as political rhetoric, with references to kings with unjustified power aimed at portraying reigning monarch, Charles I of England, as a tyrant. Little was done about his propagandizing however. Dorislaus became advocate general of the army in the first civil war, and for all his previous theorizing about ancient liberties, quickly showed authoritarian tendencies by his attempted introduction of martial law to help him root out Royalists. He is remembered for his part in the High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I, although his role was not prominent, and being assassinated by Royalists while on a diplomatic mission in his native country. \"Dorislaus, a Hollander in English service, was appointed by Parliament as ambassador in addition to Strickland. A few days after his arrival he was murdered in cold blood by some Scottish royalists from Montrose following. \"\n\nFrom a strongly Calvinist family, he was educated at Leiden, He arrived in England as the University of Cambridge's first ever professor of History. From the outset he attacked the legitimacy of kings and justified revolt, as when he emphasized the Anglo-Saxon roots of England before 1066, emphasizing what he saw as democratic freedom enjoyed by all Englishmen before they lost it to the Norman conquerors and also justified the Dutch uprising against Spain. His apparent propagandizing for republicanism and regicide was seen as aimed at the King Charles I of England, who was suspected of Catholic sympathies and failure to uphold the country's interests against powerful foreign enemies. Despite his thinly veiled condemnation of the reigning royal power, little real action was taken against him apart from his doctorate being delayed. In 1629 he was admitted a commoner of the College of Advocates. In 1632 he made his peace at court, and on two occasions acted as judge advocate, in the Bishops War of 1640 and in 1642 in the army commanded by the Earl of Essex. Despite his early advocacy of freedom from untrammeled power, once ensconced in a position of authority, Dorislaus attempted to sweep away legal protection for the accused. He assisted in preparing the charge of high treason against Charles I, but was not prominent in the proceedings themselves.\n\nIn 1648 he became Judge of the High Court of Admiralty, and was sent on a diplomatic errand to the states general of Holland, which was accused of having profited from England's civil war. Dorislaus did not live to see the First Anglo-Dutch War in which the Puritan regime of Cromwell fought its fellow Protestant power over commercial rivalries. While negotiating as a representative of the Commonwealth in the Dutch Republic, he was murdered at the Hague by Englishmen, largely because of his role in the trial of Charles I.\nThe assassination caused dismay among Cromwell's associates and great jubilation among royalists.\nHis remains were buried in Westminster Abbey, and moved in 1661 to St. Margaret's churchyard.\n\n"}

{"id": "2311822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311822", "title": "History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent", "text": "History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent\n\nThe history of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent began prior to the 3rd millennium BCE and continued well into the British Raj. Metals and related concepts were mentioned in various early Vedic age texts. The Rigveda already uses the Sanskrit term Ayas (metal). The Indian cultural and commercial contacts with the Near East and the Greco-Roman world enabled an exchange of metallurgic sciences. With the advent of the Mughals, India's Mughal Empire (established: April 21, 1526—ended: September 21, 1857) further improved the established tradition of metallurgy and metal working in India.\n\nThe imperial policies of the British Raj led to stagnation of metallurgy in India as the British regulated mining and metallurgy—used in India previously by its rulers to build armies and resist England during various wars.\n\nRecent excavations in Middle Ganga Valley done by archaeologist Rakesh Tewari show iron working in India may have begun as early as 1800 BCE. Archaeological sites in India, such as Malhar, Dadupur, Raja Nala Ka Tila and Lahuradewa in the state of Uttar Pradesh show iron implements in the period between 1800 BCE - 1200 BCE. Sahi (1979: 366) concluded that by the early 13th century BCE, iron smelting was definitely practiced on a bigger scale in India, suggesting that the date the technology's inception may well be placed as early as the 16th century BCE.\n\nThe Black and Red Ware culture was another early Iron Age archaeological culture of the northern Indian subcontinent. It is dated to roughly the 12th – 9th centuries BCE, and associated with the post-Rigvedic Vedic civilization. It extended from the upper Gangetic plain in Uttar Pradesh to the eastern Vindhya range and West Bengal.\n\nPerhaps as early as 300 BCE, although certainly by 200 CE, high quality steel was being produced in southern India by what Europeans would later call the crucible technique. In this system, high-purity wrought iron, charcoal, and glass were mixed in crucibles and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon. The resulting high-carbon steel, called fūlāḏ فولاذ in Arabic and wootz by later Europeans, was exported throughout much of Asia and Europe.\n\nWill Durant wrote in \"The Story of Civilization I: Our Oriental Heritage\":\n\nThe Sanskrit term Ayas means metal and can refer to bronze, copper or iron.\n\nThe Rig Veda refers to ayas, and also states that the Dasyus had Ayas (RV 2.20.8). In RV 4.2.17, \"the gods [are] smelting like copper/metal ore the human generations\".\n\nThe references to Ayas in the Rig Veda probably refer to bronze or copper rather than to iron. Scholars like Bhargava maintain that Rigved was written in the Vedic state of Brahmavarta and Khetri Copper mines formed an important location in Brahmavarta. Vedic people had used Copper extensively in agriculture, Water purification, tools, utensils etc., D. K. Chakrabarti (1992) argued: \"It should be clear that any controversy regarding the meaning of ayas in the Rgveda or the problem of the Rgvedic familiarity or unfamiliarity with iron is pointless. There is no positive evidence either way. It can mean both copper-bronze and iron and, strictly on the basis of the contexts, there is no reason to choose between the two.\"\n\nThe Arthashastra lays down the role of the Director of Metals, the Director of Forest Produce and the Director of Mining. It is the duty of the Director of Metals to establish factories for different metals. The Director of Mines is responsible for the inspection of mines. The Arthashastra also refers to counterfeit coins.\n\nThere are many references to Ayas in the early Indian texts.\n\nThe Atharva Veda and the Satapatha Brahmana refer to \"krsna ayas\" (\"black metal\"), which could be iron (but possibly also iron ore and iron items not made of smelted iron). There is also some controversy if the term syamayas (\"black metal) refers to iron or not. In later texts the term refers to iron. In earlier texts, it could possibly also refer to darker-than-copper bronze, an alloy of copper and tin. Copper can also become black by heating it. Oxidation with the use of sulphides can produce the same effect.\n\nThe Yajurveda seems to know iron. In the Taittiriya Samhita are references to ayas and at least one reference to smiths. The Satapatha Brahmana 6.1.3.5 refers to the smelting of metallic ore. In the Manu Smriti (6.71), the following analogy is found: \"For as the impurities of metallic ores, melted in the blast (of a furnace), are consumed, even so the taints of the organs are destroyed through the suppression of the breath.\" Metal was also used in agriculture, and the Buddhist text Suttanipata has the following analogy: \"for as a ploughshare that has got hot during the day when thrown into the water splashes, hisses and smokes in volumes...\"\n\nIn the Charaka Samhita an analogy occurs that probably refers to the lost wax technique. The Silpasastras (the Manasara, the Manasollasa (Abhilashitartha Chintamani) and the Uttarabhaga of Silparatna) describe the lost wax technique in detail.\n\nThe Silappadikaram says that copper-smiths were in Puhar and in Madura. According to the History of the Han Dynasty by Ban Gu, Kashmir and \"Tien-chu\" were rich in metals.\n\nAn influential Indian metallurgist and alchemist was Nagarjuna (born 931). He wrote the treatise \"Rasaratnakara\" that deals with preparations of \"rasa\" (mercury) compounds. It gives a survey of the status of metallurgy and alchemy in the land. Extraction of metals such as silver, gold, tin and copper from their ores and their purification were also mentioned in the treatise. The Rasa Ratnasamuccaya describes the extraction and use of copper.\n\nChakrabarti (1976) has identified six early iron-using centres in India: Baluchistan, the Northwest, the Indo-Gangetic divide and the upper Gangetic valley, eastern India, Malwa and Berar in central India and the megalithic south India. The central Indian region seems to be the earliest iron-using centre.\n\nAccording to Tewari, iron using and iron \"was prevalent in the Central Ganga Plain and the Eastern Vindhyas from the early 2nd millennium BC.\"\n\nThe earliest evidence for smelted iron in India dates to 1300 to 1000 BCE. These early findings also occur in places like the Deccan and the earliest evidence for smelted iron occurs in Central India, not in north-western India. Moreover, the dates for iron in India are not later than in those of Central Asia, and according to some scholars (e.g. Koshelenko 1986) the dates for smelted iron may actually be earlier in India than in Central Asia and Iran. The Iron Age did however not necessary imply a major social transformation, and Gregory Possehl wrote that \"the Iron Age is more of a continuation of the past then a break with it\".\n\nArchaeological data suggests that India was \"an independent and early centre of iron technology.\" According to Shaffer, the \"nature and context of the iron objects involved [of the BRW culture] are very different from early iron objects found in Southwest Asia.\" In Central Asia, the development of iron technology was not necessarily connected with Indo-Iranian migrations either.\n\nJ.M. Kenoyer (1995) also remarks that there is a \"long break in tin acquisition\" necessary for the production of \"tin bronzes\" in the Indus Valley region, suggesting a lack of contact with Baluchistan and northern Afghanistan, or the lack of migrants from the north-west who could have procured tin.\n\nThe copper-bronze metallurgy in the Harappan civilization was widespread and had a high variety and quality. The early use of iron may have developed from the practice of copper-smelting. While there is to date no proven evidence for smelted iron in the Indus Valley Civilization, iron ore and iron items have been unearthed in eight Indus Valley sites, some of them dating to before 2600 BCE. There remains the possibility that some of these items were made of smelted iron, and the term \"krsna ayas\" might possibly also refer to these iron items, even if they are not made of smelted iron.\n\nLothali copper is unusually pure, lacking the arsenic typically used by coppersmiths across the rest of the Indus valley. Workers mixed tin with copper for the manufacture of celts, arrowheads, fishhooks, chisels, bangles, rings, drills and spearheads, although weapon manufacturing was minor. They also employed advanced metallurgy in following the \"cire perdue\" technique of casting, and used more than one-piece moulds for casting birds and animals. They also invented new tools such as curved saws and twisted drills unknown to other civilizations at the time.\n\nBrass was used in Lothal and Atranjikhera in the 3rd and 2nd millennium BCE. Brass and probably zinc was also found at Taxila in 4th to 3rd century BCE contexts.\n\nCopper technology may date back to the 4th millennium BCE in the Himalaya region.\nIt is the first element to be discovered in metallurgy,\nCopper and its alloys were also used to create copper-bronze images such as Buddhas or Hindu/Mahayana Buddhist deities. Xuanzang also noted that there were copper-bronze Buddha images in Magadha. In Varanasi, each stage of the image manufacturing process is handled by a specialist.\n\nOther metal objects made by Indian artisans include lamps. Copper was also a component in the razors for the tonsure ceremony.\n\nOne of the most important sources of history in the Indian subcontinent are the royal records of grants engraved on copper-plate grants (tamra-shasan or tamra-patra). Because copper does not rust or decay, they can survive indefinitely. Collections of archaeological texts from the copper-plates and rock-inscriptions have been compiled and published by the Archaeological Survey of India during the past century. The earliest known copper-plate known as the Sohgaura copper-plate is a Maurya record that mentions famine relief efforts. It is one of the very few pre-Ashoka Brahmi inscriptions in India.\n\nThe deepest gold mines of the Ancient world were found in the Maski region in Karnataka. There were ancient silver mines in northwest India. Dated to the middle of the 1st millennium BCE. gold and silver were also used for making utensils for the royal family and nobilities.the royal family wore costly fabrics so it may be assumed that gold and silver were beaten into thin fibres and embroidered or woven into fabrics or dress.\n\nRecent excavations in Middle Ganges Valley show iron working in India may have begun as early as 1800 BCE. In the 5th century BCE, the Greek historian Herodotus observed that \"Indian and the Persian army used arrows tipped with iron.\" Ancient Romans used armour and cutlery made of Indian iron. Pliny the Elder also mentioned Indian iron. Muhammad al-Idrisi wrote the Hindus excelled in the manufacture of iron, and that it would be impossible to find anything to surpass the edge from Hindwani steel. Quintus Curtius wrote about an Indian present of steel to Alexander. \"Ferrum indicum\" appeared in the list of articles subject to duty under Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. Indian Wootz steel was held in high regard in Europe, and Indian iron was often considered to be the best.\n\nThe first form of crucible steel was wootz, developed in India some time around 300 BCE. In its production the iron was mixed with glass and then slowly heated and then cooled. As the mixture cooled the glass would bond to impurities in the steel and then float to the surface, leaving the steel considerably more pure. Carbon could enter the iron by diffusing in through the porous walls of the crucibles. Carbon dioxide would not react with the iron, but the small amounts of carbon monoxide could, adding carbon to the mix with some level of control. Wootz was widely exported throughout the Middle East, where it was combined with a local production technique around 1000 CE to produce Damascus steel, famed throughout the world. Wootz derives from the Tamil term for steel \"urukku\". Indian wootz steel was the first high quality steel that was produced.\n\nHenry Yule quoted the 12th-century Arab Edrizi who wrote: \"The Hindus excel in the manufacture of iron, and in the preparations of those ingredients along with which it is fused to obtain that kind of soft iron which is usually styled Indian steel (Hindiah). They also have workshops wherein are forged the most famous sabres in the world. ...It is not possible to find anything to surpass the edge that you get from Indian steel (al-hadid al-Hindi).\n\nAs early as the 17th century, Europeans knew of India's ability to make crucible steel from reports brought back by travelers who had observed the process at several places in southern India. Several attempts were made to import the process, but failed because the exact technique remained a mystery. Studies of wootz were made in an attempt to understand its secrets, including a major effort by the famous scientist, Michael Faraday, son of a blacksmith. Working with a local cutlery manufacturer he wrongly concluded that it was the addition of aluminium oxide and silica from the glass that gave wootz its unique properties.\n\nAfter the Indian rebellion of 1857, many Indian wootz steel swords were destroyed by order of the British authorities. Metal working suffered a decline during the British Empire, but steel production was revived in India by Jamsetji Tata.\n\nZinc was extracted in India as early as in the 4th to 3rd century BCE. Zinc production may have begun in India, and ancient northwestern India is the earliest known civilization that produced zinc on an industrial scale. The distillation technique was developed around 1200 CE at Zawar in Rajasthan.\n\nIn the 17th century, China exported Zinc to Europe under the name of totamu or tutenag. The term tutenag may derive from the South Indian term \"Tutthanagaa\" (zinc). In 1597, Libavius, a metallurgist in England received some quantity of Zinc metal and named it as Indian/Malabar lead. In 1738, William Champion is credited with patenting in Britain a process to extract zinc from calamine in a smelter, a technology that bore a strong resemblance to and was probably inspired by the process used in the Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan. His first patent was rejected by the patent court on grounds of plagiarising the technology common in India. However, he was granted the patent on his second submission of patent approval. Postlewayt's Universal Dictionary of 1751 still wasn't aware of how Zinc was produced.\n\nThe Arthashastra describes the production of zinc. The Rasaratnakara by Nagarjuna describes the production of brass and zinc. There are references of medicinal uses of zinc in the Charaka Samhita (300 BCE). The Rasaratna Samuchaya (800 CE) explains the existence of two types of ores for zinc metal, one of which is ideal for metal extraction while the other is used for medicinal purpose. It also describes two methods of zinc distillation.\n\nRecent excavations in Middle Ganges Valley conducted by archaeologist Rakesh Tewari show iron working in India may have begun as early as 1800 BCE. Archaeological sites in India, such as Malhar, Dadupur, Raja Nala Ka Tila and Lahuradewa in the state of Uttar Pradesh show iron implements in the period between 1800 BCE-1200 BCE. Sahi (1979: 366) concluded that by the early 13th century BCE, iron smelting was definitely practiced on a bigger scale in India, suggesting that the date the technology's early period may well be placed as early as the 16th century BCE.\n\nSome of the early iron objects found in India are dated to 1400 BCE by employing the method of radio carbon dating. Spikes, knives, daggers, arrow-heads, bowls, spoons, saucepans, axes, chisels, tongs, door fittings etc. ranging from 600 BCE—200 BCE have been discovered from several archaeological sites. In Southern India (present day Mysore) iron appeared as early as the 12th or 11th century BCE. These developments were too early for any significant close contact with the northwest of the country.\n\nThe earliest available Bronze age swords of copper discovered from the Harappan sites in Pakistan date back to 2300 BCE. Swords have been recovered in archaeological findings throughout the Ganges-Jamuna Doab region of India, consisting of bronze but more commonly copper. Diverse specimens have been discovered in Fatehgarh, where there are several varieties of hilt. These swords have been variously dated to periods between 1700-1400 BCE, but were probably used more extensively during the opening centuries of the 1st millennium BCE.\n\nThe beginning of the 1st millennium BCE saw extensive developments in iron metallurgy in India. Technological advancement and mastery of iron metallurgy was achieved during this period of peaceful settlements. The years between 322—185 BCE saw several advancements being made to the technology involved in metallurgy during the politically stable Maurya period (322—185 BCE). Greek historian Herodotus (431—425 BCE) wrote the first western account of the use of iron in India.\n\nPerhaps as early as 300 BCE—although certainly by 200 CE—high quality steel was being produced in southern India by what Europeans would later call the crucible technique. In this system, high-purity wrought iron, charcoal, and glass were mixed in a crucible and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon. The first crucible steel was the wootz steel that originated in India before the beginning of the common era. Wootz steel was widely exported and traded throughout ancient Europe, China, the Arab world, and became particularly famous in the Middle East, where it became known as Damascus steel. Archaeological evidence suggests that this manufacturing process was already in existence in South India well before the common era.\n\nZinc mines of Zawar, near Udaipur, Rajasthan, were active during 400 BCE. There are references of medicinal uses of zinc in the Charaka Samhita (300 BCE). The Rasaratna Samuccaya (800 CE) explains the existence of two types of ores for zinc metal, one of which is ideal for metal extraction while the other is used for medicinal purpose. The \"Periplus Maris Erythraei\" mentions weapons of Indian iron and steel being exported from India to Greece.\n\nThe world's first iron pillar was the Iron pillar of Delhi—erected at the times of Chandragupta II Vikramaditya (375–413). The swords manufactured in Indian workshops find written mention in the works of Muhammad al-Idrisi (flourished 1154). Indian Blades made of Damascus steel found their way into Persia. European scholars—during the 14th century—studied Indian casting and metallurgy technology.\nIndian metallurgy under the Mughal emperor Akbar (reign: 1556-1605) produced excellent small firearms. Gommans (2002) holds that Mughal handguns were stronger and more accurate than their European counterparts.\n\nSrivastava & Alam (2008) comment on Indian coinage of the Mughal Empire (established: April 21, 1526 - ended: September 21, 1857) during Akbar's regime:\n\nStatues of \"Nataraja\" and \"Vishnu\" were cast during the reign of the imperial Chola dynasty (200-1279) in the 9th century. The casting could involve a mixture of five metals: copper, zinc, tin, gold, and silver.\n\nConsidered one of the most remarkable feats in metallurgy, the Seamless celestial globe was invented in Kashmir by Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in 998 AH (1589-90 CE), and twenty other such globes were later produced in Lahore and Kashmir during the Mughal Empire. Before they were rediscovered in the 1980s, it was believed by modern metallurgists to be technically impossible to produce metal globes without any seams, even with modern technology. These Mughal metallurgists pioneered the method of lost-wax casting in order to produce these globes.\n\nModern steel making in India began with the setting of first blast furnace of India at Kulti in 1870 and production began in 1874, which was set up by Bengal Iron Works. The Ordnance Factory Board established Metal & Steel Factory (MSF) at Calcutta, in 1872 The Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) was established by Dorabji Tata in 1907, as part of his father's conglomerate. By 1939 Tata operated the largest steel plant in the British Empire, and accounted for a significant proportion of the 2 million tons pig iron and 1.13 of steel produced in British India annually.\n\nThe first iron-cased and metal-cylinder rockets were developed by the Mysorean army of the South Indian Kingdom of Mysore in the 1780s. The Mysoreans successfully used these iron-cased rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The village has a population of 303 but this is set to rise to around 350 once the Kingsdon Manor development is complete. The majority of the houses in the village are clustered on the side of the hill from which there are scenic views across the Somerset countryside.\n\nMany of the old buildings and houses in the village are protected with Grade 2 listed building status and the centre is also a conservation area. Recently built houses have been faced with Blue Lias stone to ensure that they blend in suitably to the village. Some buildings are thatched, including the Kingsdon Inn.\n\nKingsdon village shop is situated in the former primary school and is a volunteer run enterprise set up in 2014 as an Industrial and Provident Society for the Benefit of the Community (IPS Bencom). Outside of the shop the old telephone box has been restored to provide a library. Other amenities include a village hall, allotments and adventure play equipment on the recreation field. Kingsdon has its own cricket ground in the grounds of the former Manor. The Kingsdon Chronicle is produced monthly as an independent journal and delivered free of charge to all residents.\n\nThe village is in the low fly zone for RNAS Yeovilton. Within the wider Kingsdon parish is World Horse Welfare's Glenda Spooner Farm Rescue and Re-homing Centre, named after Glenda Spooner founder, Chairman and Organising Secretary of the Ponies of Britain Club and which cares for around 65 horses at a time.\n\nThe village is situated near the Fosse Way Roman road and two Roman villas were excavated in the village in the 19th century, but nothing remains of them today.\n\nThe village name is derived from Kingsdon Hill which is in the north west of the parish and reflects its history as part of the royal estate of Somerton at the time of the Norman Conquest. The manor was granted to the Gouvis family by 1194, and in 1528, bought by Thomas Arundell of Wardour Castle, whose descendants held it until it was sold to Aaron Moody in 1801.\n\nOn 4 March 2010 the thatched roof of the Kingsdon Inn, the village pub, caught fire and the roof was destroyed. £250,000 was subsequently spent repairing the building which was built in the early 19th century.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\n\nThe village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Langport Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nIt is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.\n\nTo the east of the village lies the River Cary and Lytes Cary a manor house with associated chapel and gardens. The property, owned by the National Trust, has parts dating to the 14th century, with other sections dating to the 15th, 16th, 18th, and 20th centuries. \"Yet all parts blend to perfection with one another and with the gentle sunny landscape that surrounds them,\" comments Nikolaus Pevsner. The House is listed as Grade I by English Heritage.\n\nSouth of the village is the A372 road which runs to Bridgwater from the Podimore roundabout on the A303.\n\nThere was a small Church of England Primary School, founded 1872, with about 10 pupils aged 4–11 years. It closed in August 2011 due to pupil numbers. In 2014 the former school was opened as a community village shop.\n\nThe village was, up until the end of the summer term 2008, home to Kingsdon Manor School, which served Bristol and other local areas as a residential Special School, for up to 40 boys aged 10–16 years with emotional or behavioural difficulties. It was housed in a large manor house built in 1830. The manor house is presently being converted for residential use with additional housing to be built in the grounds.\n\nThe ancient church, dedicated to All Saints, has a four-stage tower which was built in the 15th century replacing a previous one over the north transept. It has six bells and a clock which has no face, but has recently been restored to chime the hours. There is a hamstone effigy of a cross-legged knight under the north window. The parish is one of five in the benefice of 'Somerton with Compton Dundon, The Charltons and Kingsdon'.\n\n"}

{"id": "2311866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311866", "title": "Biljana Srbljanović", "text": "Biljana Srbljanović\n\nBiljana Srbljanović (; ; born 15 October 1970) is a Serbian playwright.\n\nShe has written eleven plays for the theater and one TV screenplay for \"Otvorena vrata\" TV series that ran on Radio Television of Serbia during the mid-1990s. Her plays have been staged in some 50 countries. Srbljanović is also a part-time lecturer at the Faculty of the Dramatic Arts in Belgrade. On 1 December 1999 she became the first foreign writer to receive the \"Ernst Toller\" prize. She is the recipient of various theatre awards, including the \"Slobodan Selenić Award\", the \"Osvajanje Slobode Award\", the \"Belgrade City Award\", The Statuette of Joakim Vujić and the \"Sterija Award\".\n\nSrbljanović was born on 15 October 1970 in Stockholm as a daughter of a member of the Yugoslav embassy diplomatic staff. In 2010, she made a speech at the Akademietheater in Vienna, where she described her father as an \"emigrant\", but this information is more than questionable in view of a member and political representative of an embassy. The wrong indication of Belgrade as the place of birth was obviously made public by herself at the beginning of her career. This false information is to be read again and again in some online biographies on her person.\n\nSrbljanović obtained her dramaturgy degree in 1995 at the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Belgrade. The first play she wrote, \"Beogradska trilogija\" (\"The Belgrade Trilogy\"), was premiered in 1997 in Belgrade, Serbia at the Yugoslav Drama Theater. After its huge success, the play was staged in many other countries, including Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, England, and the Scandinavian countries.\n\nIn April 1998 her second play, \"Porodične priče\" (\"Family Stories\"), was written in Belgrade and staged at Atelje 212. It won the Best New Play Award at the theatre festival in Novi Sad, Serbia and was later staged in Germany, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, United States, Switzerland, the Netherlands, France and elsewhere.\n\nIn December 1999, Srbljanović completed \"The Fall\", which premiered in July 2000 at the City Theater Festival in Budva, Montenegro. Due to lack of public interest, the play was quickly erased from the program of Belgrade's theaters.\n\nThe young artist can also be seen in the Serbian movie \"Land of Truth, Love and Freedom\" (Zemlja istine ljubavi i slobode) as an actress in a leading role.\n\nThe premiere of \"Supermarket\", her fourth play, took place in May 2001 at the Festival of Vienna, Austria. It is still staged in many European countries.\n\nIn late 2003, Srbljanović completed her fifth play, \"America, Part Two\". This became Serbia's most popular play in 2003 and 2004.\n\nSrbljanović's next play, \"Skakavci\" (Locusts), won the New Theatrical Realities Award, one of Europe's most prominent theatre awards. In the 2005-06 season, German theater magazine Theater Heute proclaimed Srbljanović the best foreign playwright of the season.\n\nHer latest play \"This Grave Is Too Small For Me\" has attracted international press attention as well as acclaim from various audiences in Europe.\n\nIn 2007 Srbljanović joined the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), with an additional role as a member of the party's political council. Srbljanović was LDP's candidate for mayor of Belgrade in the 2008 Serbian local elections. She has distanced herself from the party afterwards.\n\nSrbljanović has for decades been an outspoken figure in the Serbian public sphere.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, during her university days, Srbljanović was a close friend of Isidora Bjelica and wrote for the right-wing \"Pogledi\" magazine.\n\nBy mid-1990s, Srbljanović's political views swung to the left as she began fiercely opposing the policies of Slobodan Milošević as well as views held by individuals and parties in the Serbian political opposition on the right side of the political spectrum. In 1997, as one of the guests on Olja Bećković's \"Utisak nedelje\" talk programme on Studio B, Srbljanović squared off against her former \"Pogledi\" editor-in-chief Miloslav Samardžić over the issue of American magnate George Soros injecting funds into the pro-Western Serbian media outlets, primarily B92.\n\nEven after the 5 October 2000 Overthrow in Serbia, she continued railing against what she viewed to be \"the irresponsibility of the political elite in Serbia\", \"Serbian violent nationalism\" and \"the culture of violence and exclusion in Serbian daily life\". From May 2006 until February 2009, she maintained her own blog on the B92.net site where among other things she frequently criticized various individuals, mostly Serbian politicians and other public figures who displayed political opinions she opposes such as Nebojša Krstić, adviser to the Serbian president Boris Tadić.\n\nIn 2010 Srbljanović opened a Twitter account where she continued commenting on Serbian politics. During late summer 2011, she got into several heated exchanges with the Democratic Party (DS) spokeswoman Jelena Trivan.\n\nThe artist is signatory of the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins within the project \"Languages and Nationalisms\" (Jezici i nacionalzmi). The declaration is against political separation of four Serbo-Croatian standard variants that leads to a series of negative social, cultural and political phenomena in which linguistic expression is enforced as a criterion of ethno-national affiliation and as a means of political loyalty in successor states of Yugoslavia.\n\nIn March 2001, Srbljanović was sued for libel by film director Emir Kusturica as a result of calling him \"an immoral Milošević's profiteer\" in her op-ed piece in the \"Vreme\" magazine. She further claimed in the same piece that Kusturica's 1995 film \"Underground\" was mostly financed by the Serbian state-owned TV (RTS), which was financially and editorially controlled by Milošević's regime at the time, accusing the director of \"directly collaborating with the regime via his friend Milorad Vučelić\". In December 2003, the Belgrade municipal court ruled in Kusturica's favour as her claims couldn't stand up to closer scrutiny after Kusturica's attorney Branislav Tapušković provided a complete documentation of \"Underground\" producers and financiers thus proving that funding mostly came from the European production companies while parts of the movie were only shot in Serbian studios.\n\nIn July 2007 Srbljanović criticized basketball player Milan Gurović on her blog, referring to him as \"that tattooed idiot\", for having a tattoo of World War II Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović on his arm.\n\nAdditionally, Srbljanović aroused controversy with her 18 February 2012 tweet referring to the news item about former Serbian interior minister Dragan Jočić getting extra police security following the arrest of a gangster Luka Bojović. Srbljanović's tweet — \"'Jočić getting extra security detail' why? he ain't gonna run\" — mocked the fact Jočić is physically disabled ever since his 2008 car accident.\n\nSrbljanović set off a torrent of negative sentiment from the general public in Serbia after making an awkward joke during the catastrophic May 2014 floods on Twitter. The tweet in Serbian read \"Excuse me for not being compassionate, but you have 10 more minutes to swim to the gallery for the promotion of the book \"Tomato\"\". A flurry of tweets, Facebook posts and news updates were quick to condemn the post, and her Twitter account @leyakeller became unavailable not long after \n\nIn January 2019, Srbljanović got into a vicious online exchange with actor and newly appointed Movement of Free Citizens (PSG) leader Sergej Trifunović whom she had previously collaborated with professionally in addition to an overlap in their respective studies at the University of Arts' Faculty of Dramatic Arts (FDU). Responding to Trifunović's tweet about her early 1990s right-wing views and activist activity, Srbljanović launched into an obscenity-laced, insult-laden tirade on her Facebook account, eviscerating his morality, professionalism, personal hygiene, and accusing him of responsibility in the murder of Zoran Đinđić. Serbian actress and film producer Bojana Maljević, who has also had a prior professional history with Srbljanović, supported the veracity of the event referenced in Trifunović's original tweet.\n\nIn 2006 Srbljanović married Gabriel Keller, former French ambassador in Serbia. They got divorced in 2014.\nSrbljanović is related to Radovan Karadžić, wartime political leader of Bosnian Serbs, sentenced to 40 years in prison by the international tribunal at The Hague.\n\nSrbljanović got detained by police on 1 December 2011 while buying cocaine in Belgrade from twenty-seven-year-old street dealer Miloš \"Šone\" Stanojčić; she was subsequently cited for possession of illegal substances. According to Serbian police, she bought drugs on two occasions, each time paying €60. Srbljanović ended up avoiding prison by taking a plea deal from the prosecutor's office in late March 2012 — agreeing to donate RSD200,000 to charity as well as to testify against the drug dealer who sold her the drugs.\n\n"}

Established in 1328, it is Munich's oldest independent brewery. The company is owned by the Edith Haberland Wagner Trust 51% and the Inselkammer-Family 49%.\n\nThe Augustiner Brewery was first mentioned by name in 1328, established within an Augustianian Monastery which had been settled just outside the Munich city walls in an area called Haberfeld (or Haferfeld – \"oat field\") in 1294. The Monastery complex was the largest sacred building in Munich until the completion of the Frauenkirche cathedral in 1494. The Augustinian monks supplied beer to the Bavarian Royal Wittelsbach family until 1589, at which time the Hofbräu brewery was founded.\n\nIn 1759, the Augustinian Monks of Munich were among the first members of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Meanwhile, during this era, Augustiner's annual output reached 250,000 liters, three times the amount of an average brewery of the time.\n\nIn 1803, as part of a secularization movement, the monastery was dissolved, and the brewery was run by the state before passing into private ownership. Then in 1817, as the original building had fallen in great disrepair, the brewery was moved to Neuhauser Straße.\n\nAnton and Therese Wagner, a brewing family from the vicinity of neighboring Freising acquired the enterprise and the brewery has continued to be privately owned since. Around 1840, Anton Wagner acquired a storage facility on Rosenheimer Straße in order to expand the brewery and after Anton's death in 1845, his wife Therese ran the business.\n\nAugustiner entered the industrial age in 1852 with the adoption of a steam engine to aid in production. Then in 1857, a further storage facility was acquired on Landsberger Straße, and eventually all production was moved to the new site, while a brewery-sponsored restaurant continued operation at the Neuhauser Straße location.\n\nJoseph Wagner (\"JW\" as marked on the current label), took on the management role following his mother's death. The brewery further expanded in 1862 with the addition of another storage cellar at Arnulfstraße 52, the current site of the famous Augustiner Keller and Beer Garden.\n\nIn 1880, Joseph Wagner was recognized as a founding member of the Bavarian Beer alliance, and later in 1887, Augustiner's iconic \"JW\" trademark with the bishop's staff was registered.\n\nAs a result of the aerial bombing of Munich during World War II, Augustiner Brewery was 60% destroyed. In 1971, the brew house was completely renovated, adopting the use of stainless steel tanks.\n\nIn 1996, Edith Haberland Wagner, the last of the Wagner dynasty, bequeathed her share in the brewery ownership to the Edith Haberland Wagner Foundation, and the foundation continues to hold 51% of the shares of the brewery to this day.\n\nIn 2013, Augustiner opened the Klosterwirt, returning to their origins on the site of the original Augustinian Monstery, just next to the Munich Frauenkirche.\n\nIt is not known when Augustiner beer was first featured at the Oktoberfest, but the first record of an Augustiner beer stall is featured on a picture dating from 1867. The first appearance of an Augustiner beer “castle” was later in 1903, and finally in 1926, the Augustiner Festhalle was erected for the first time. The original tent featured a tower, which was later removed from the construction design during the years 1949-2010. The tower was reinstated in 2010 in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Oktoberfest, and has continued to be a feature of the Festhalle to this day. Since 1987, Augustiner is the only brewery of the 6 featured at Oktoberfest, to exclusively pour from their wooden barrels.\n\nAugustiner beer is normally found within the Greater Munich area, but in the last few years it has become popular outside Munich, for example in Berlin, where it is one of the most successful beers in Mitte, even though the company does not advertise. When most German breweries updated their bottles to a slim and more modern design to give their beer a more classy and less old fashioned appearance, Augustiner stuck with its original \"classic\" form, often nicknamed the \"Bauarbeiterhalbe\" (construction worker's half litre). The labels have also not changed in over 20 years. The success of the brand has been attributed to the traditional \"retro\" image it enjoys as one of the last major breweries in Munich that is not owned by an international beer conglomerate; Augustiner-Bräu is 51%-owned by a charitable foundation.\nAugustiner-Bräu operates a beer tent at the Oktoberfest, as well as owning one of Munich's largest beer gardens, the Augustiner-Keller at Arnulfstraße 52, and several traditional bars throughout the city.\n\nIt is imported into United States by Global Village Imports, LLC. of King of Prussia, PA. Since distribution is very limited, only Augustiner Edelstoff and Maximator are available.\n\nAll of Augustiner′s brands are brewed in accordance with the Reinheitsgebot. This means the ingredients of the beer are just four: water, grain (barley and or wheat), hops and yeast.\n\n"}
